He was portrayed by Josh Kelly from December 29, 2010 to December 29, 2011. Kelly reprised the role when new daily episodes of OLTL began airing on Hulu via The Online Network from April 29, 2013 to August 19, 2013, until the show (along with All My Children) were both put on indefinite hiatus due to Prospect Park's lawsuit against ABC. Casting Kelly was originally cast in the long-time role of Joey Buchanan, a character that was returning to the show as a permanent contract role after six years. However, producers later decided that Kelly was a better fit for the newly created character Cutter, who, like Joey, would also serve as a love interest for both Terri Conn's Aubrey Wentworth and Gina Tognoni's Kelly Cramer. The role of Joey would be taken by Tom Degnan. Background Cutter's father Billy Joe Wentworth grew up poor and worked three jobs while putting himself through school. When Billy Joe successfully invested his money in the stock market after getting a job as a stock trader, he became very wealthy, changing his name to William J. Wentworth Jr. He married Alex Olanov with whom he had two children: Cutter and Aubrey (who later changed her name to Kimberly Andrews). Eventually, Alex abandoned her family and took off with a piece of her husband's fortune, and a depressed, heartbroken William alienated his friends and family, and lost his entire fortune that he spent trying to track down his missing wife. A young Cutter found William dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and he and his sister were separated from each other and placed into the foster care system, because they couldn't get any money from their father's insurance because of his suicide. Cutter ran away from every foster home he was put into so that he could search for his sister. Cutter eventually found his sister and both became con artists in an attempt to regain the wealth and happiness from their childhoods. = 2010–2011 = Cutter is first seen on Aubrey Wentworth's doorstep on New Year's Eve 2010. Cutter and Aubrey quickly connect where they then begin to kiss until Aubrey demands Cutter to leave Llanview immediately, and return to Europe. Cutter responds by saying that he's going to decide to stay in Llanview for a while. Aubrey then tells Cutter that if they get caught together then their entire plan could be jeopardized. By now it is clear, both Aubrey and Cutter are lovers as well as con-artists. From the beginning, Aubrey was meant to win Joey Buchanan's love so she could marry him, and go after his money as well as the entire Buchanan family fortune. Although Joey's father Clint Buchanan quickly suspected something off about Aubrey, as well did Joey's ex-wife Kelly Cramer. As Aubrey became more and more cautious about Cutter's stay in Llanview, he began to sense that Aubrey was in fact falling in love with Joey. Cutter warned Aubrey that it's nothing more, and couldn't be more. Aubrey denied any feelings leaving Cutter still suspicious that Aubrey was having mixed feelings about conning Joey and his family. Once provocative photos of Aubrey and Cutter reached French magazines in Llanview, Aubrey quickly worked to dispose them all, until one had already been bought by Kelly Cramer. Kelly revealed to Joey that Aubrey was cheating on him with Cutter, and a furious Joey then confronted Aubrey about the photos; where a then semi-nude Cutter walked out of Aubrey's bedroom. Cutter told Joey he was Aubrey's brother, and that the photos were taken out of context. Joey believed Cutter and Aubrey and apologized. After finding out it was Kelly who showed Joey the last remaining magazine, Cutter decided he would \\"take care\\" of Kelly, for she was already beginning to be trouble for them both. After Kelly found out about Aubrey and Cutter's gold-digging schemes, they break up with each other, and Cutter goes on to try to woo Kelly's aunt Dorian Lord for her money instead, but that plan soon fails when Dorian's ex-fiancé David Vickers returns to Llanview after being rescued by Bo Buchanan and Rex Balsom after he was kidnapped by Clint and sent to a Morraccan prison, and later held hostage by Alex Olanov at St. Blaze's island. Dorian and David soon reunited with each other, and both of them kick Cutter to the curb. After Dorian dumps him, Cutter then befriends Tess/Jessica Ford at the parking lot of the Capricorn nightclub when she sneaks into his car, and the two decide to get to know each other a little better at Cutter's motel room at the Minute Man Motel after Cutter decides to go after Tess/Jessica's money as a Plan B. Weeks later, Cutter sees that Aubrey is starting to care for Joey, and calls her out on it. Aubrey denies it, though several moments make it clear that she is in love with Joey. Fed up, Cutter starts an affair with Jessica Buchanan, who is currently Tess, which angers Aubrey. Tess finds out about their scheme and wants in, and Cutter agrees, much to the dismay of Aubrey. In April 2011, Tess and her husband Robert Ford lose custody of Ryder, putting Cutter and Aubrey's scheme in jeopardy when Aubrey volunteers to get temporary custody of Ryder with Joey, which causes Cutter to break up with Aubrey for good. However, Tess meets Cutter and reveals that she attacked Ford and has a new plan: They could get married as another way of not committing her into St. Anne's. On May 5, 2011, Tess and Cutter marry, and Ford punches Cutter when he finds out. After they got married, Cutter later experiences Jessica morphing into another alter named Wes (named after Jessica's ex-fiancé Brody Lovett's friend Wes Granger from his days as part of the Navy SEALS team during their war days) after having an argument with Brody over Tess/Jessica. Cutter also meets Jessica's other alter Bess after Wes was arrested for aiding and abetting Marty Saybrooke's kidnapping of Natalie Buchanan and John McBain's son Liam. Jessica eventually morphs back to being Tess again, and she is released on bail. After having to deal with Jessica's other alters Wes and Bess, Cutter gets fed up with Jessica's DID, and decides to double cross his wife by going to see her parents to discuss a deal to get Jessica serious professional help by using blackmail and extortion to get his way as payback for having to put up with their daughter's mental issues on May 25, 2011. In exchange for getting Tess committed to St. Anne's, Cutter makes an extortion deal with Clint and his ex- wife Victoria Lord to get his piece of the family fortune and the Buchanan Mansion where he kicks out Joey, Aubrey, Ryder, and Aubrey's best friend Rama Patel on June 1, 2011. Rama convinces Cutter to let her still stay in the mansion by lying to him about not wanting Aubrey to break up with him to stay with Joey, and blackmailing him about a \\"dirty little secret\\" that he's been keeping from Aubrey. Cutter also welcomes in Rama's husband Vimal Patel to move into the mansion after he is exonerated from prison after he took the fall for Clint for switching the DNA paternity results for his boss' daughters. On June 17, 2011, Rama blackmails Cutter to agree to Ford's request to end his marriage to Tess by signing divorce papers. On June 28, 2011, the mansion's butler Nigel Bartholomew-Smythe told Cutter that the deed Clint signed over to him had a loophole in it in which Clint could take back the mansion from him, and Cutter lost ownership of the mansion to Rex when he took the deed of the mansion from his father Clint (in exchange for allowing his recently deceased fiancée Gigi Morasco's heart to be donated to Clint after his heart was destroyed after he had a double heart attack). Cutter, Rama, and Vimal are all evicted from the Buchanan Mansion. Cutter later moves into Aubrey and Rama's motel room at the Minute Man Motel after Renee Divine Buchanan not only got him banned from the Palace Hotel, but also banned him from all the other hotels in Llanview. Cutter also admits that the Buchanans also took back all of the money that they paid him, since he didn't stash most of the cash in the bank, leaving Cutter broke and almost out of money. On July 21, 2011, Cutter gives Aubrey the divorce papers delivered from Joey that he found under the door at their motel room. On August 16, 2011, Cutter convinces Aubrey to make the newly wealthy Rex her next mark while they are both hanging out at the Capricorn. Aubrey tries to seduce Rex but he doesn't pay any attention to her because he is obsessed with a clue he got from psychic Madame Delphina about a \\"spotted pony\\" (which could be related to Rex being haunted by Gigi's ghost). When Aubrey tells Cutter about the cryptic clue before she leaves the club, Cutter then figures out secretly by himself that the clue refers to The Spotted Pony strip club in Anchorage, Kentucky, which is related to Cutter's secret. Cutter then calls Rama to get her to come talk to him about Rex. Cutter accuses Rama of telling his secret to Rex. Rama reassures Cutter that she doesn't know Rex and that their secret with what happened to Cutter at The Spotted Pony is still safe between them. On August 19, 2011, Aubrey packs her bags at her motel room in preparation of leaving town when Cutter returns and asks her not leave him. Aubrey tells Cutter that she doesn't want to be part of his scams anymore and heads out the door but stops dead in her tracks when Cutter calls her by her real name, Christine Karr. The two discuss their past and Cutter tries to assure Aubrey that Joey was their last mark. Cutter blames himself for Aubrey falling for Joey. Aubrey then decides to stay with Cutter until she can get back on her feet. Cutter points out the irony that after all the scams they've pulled, they ended up in the exact opposite type of room that he always envisioned them in their lives. http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/news/2010/1007-degnan_kelly.php On September 2, 2011, Cutter gets a job as a front desk clerk at The Minute Man Motel so that he could impress Aubrey by turning over a new leaf. Cutter and Aubrey then rekindle their romantic relationship by making love to each other before Cutter goes to work. When Cutter opens the door to leave for work though, he is surprised to see former stripper Kimberly Andrews, a woman that he calls \\"Aubrey\\", revealing that Kim's real name is Aubrey Wentworth, his real sister. It was soon revealed that his sister stole money from her classmate Rama when they both attended boarding school in France, and Aubrey used the money to have plastic surgery to change her looks from an \\"ugly duckling\\" to a sexy looking woman, but Kim promised that she would later pay back Rama for her stolen money. Cutter and Kim then talked about what happened in their lives after they separated, and Cutter told Kim that he learned about the Buchanans after he read about Kim marrying Clint in the newspaper, which inspired him to make Joey his next target with Aubrey. Cutter also learns from Kim that she's been keeping her best friend Stacy Morasco in a hospital in Kentucky, after she was presumed dead after drowning in a frozen lake a year and a half ago on Llantano Mountain. On September 9, 2011, Cutter bought Roxy Balsom's stuffed beaver Morris at a flea market outside in Angel Square for Aubrey as a gift. Cutter told Aubrey that he and his sister were once scamming partners with Kim when Cutter worked with her to seduce rich men for their money after she got her plastic surgery, but they later parted ways when they were both exposed as con artists after the incident at the Spotted Pony. Cutter would also confess to Aubrey that Kim had a sick friend she was taking care of in the hospital in Kentucky. Cutter and Aubrey discovered that a gun was hidden in Morris after they knocked it over and the gun fell out of the bottom of the beaver. Aubrey and Cutter soon figured out that the gun belonged to Rex, who was one of the suspects for the murder of Victor Lord Jr.. Cutter is tempted to use Rex's gun to blackmail him for the Buchanan fortune. Aubrey convinces him to turn the gun over to the police. Cutter decides to still keep the gun inside the beaver against Aubrey's wishes. Kim discovers that Rex's gun is inside Morris. Kim tries to convince Cutter to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune so that she could pay for Stacy's medical bills at the hospital in Kentucky and give back the family fortune to Clint, but Cutter refuses to revert to his scamming ways because of his promise to Aubrey to go straight. Kim is visited by Rex's biological mother Echo DiSavoy, who also wants the beaver and the gun back from Cutter. Kim goes through her plan to blackmail Echo and try to convince her son to hand over the entire Buchanan fortune back to Clint and to help pay her friend Stacy's medical bills. Cutter later comes home from work to discover that the gun is missing from inside Morris after Aubrey looks inside to see if Cutter turned in the gun to the police yet. Cutter then starts to panic, and finds out that his sister Kim was the one to steal the gun from the beaver. On September 21, 2011, Cutter goes to the hospital in Kentucky to confront her sister about stealing Rex's gun from him, and Kim tells Cutter to let her still keep Rex's gun to continue to blackmail Echo to convince Rex to sign over the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint and to help pay for Stacy's medical bills. Cutter then sees Stacy in her room and is surprised to find out what happened to Stacy. Kim tells Cutter not to tell anyone about Stacy's mysterious circumstances. Cutter agrees to keep her secret since he feels no one will believe him when he tells someone about Stacy's secret. On October 11, 2011, Aubrey finds out from police commissioner Bo Buchanan that Cutter lied about turning over Rex's gun to the police and breaks up with Cutter after coming to the conclusion that he will never change his grifting ways. Cutter then heads back to the hospital in Kentucky and tells Kim that Aubrey broke up with him because he lied about what he did with Rex's gun, and blamed Kim for the break-up. Cutter also wanted to revert to being a grifter by blackmailing Kim to give him the forged documents that Echo signed Rex's signature on that will give Clint back his fortune, or he will tell everyone in Llanview that Stacy is still alive with her sister Gigi Morasco's face! Cutter then asks Kim if she was sure if the woman in the hospital room is really Stacy. Kim confessed to Cutter that Stacy survived drowning in that frozen lake a year and a half ago, and that she got plastic surgery in South America to look like Gigi so that she could take over her life! Kim also said that she tried to stop Stacy by following her to Llanview to stop her scheme against her sister. Kim then discovered that Stacy was trapped in the basement of a rental house that was leaking carbon monoxide along with her dead sister Gigi. Cutter then told Kim that he believed her about what she told him about Stacy. Kim also let her brother have the forged documents on the condition that he could give her some of the money that he'll extort to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Cutter met up with Rama at an arranged meeting at the Spotted Pony where Rama revealed what happened that night several years ago at the strip club. When Rama try to track down Kim at the club to get try to get the money she stole from her to pay for her plastic surgery, she saw her brother Cutter kneeling over a dead body named Mr. Berger, who was a rich guy that was a patron at the club who was Cutter and Kim's mark. Cutter enlisted Kim to seduce Mr. Berger for his money by working as a stripper at the club. Cutter then sneaked in too much \\"mickey\\" in Mr. Berger's drink, which caused him to pass out and die. Rama said she had proof of the incident with a picture she took on her cell phone of Cutter and the dead guy, and she still wanted to blackmail Cutter for the crime. Cutter then convinced Rama to conspire with him to let Kim take the fall for the crime, or they will both lose everything they want in their respective scams. Cutter and Rama then set up Kim to have her arrested for the murder of Mr. Berger. Before Kim was sent to jail, she tells Cutter to help take care of Stacy for her while she's gone. Cutter then goes to the hospital and finds out that she woke up from her coma. On October 20, 2011, Cutter blackmails Clint to give back the entire Buchanan fortune from Rex's forged signature on the documents back to him for a price. When Clint turns down his offer, Cutter decides to use Stacy as leverage to get the Buchanan fortune by blackmailing Clint's son Rex. On October 24, Cutter meets Rex at his office at Buchanan Enterprises to blackmail him for the Buchanan fortune in exchange to bring a still alive Gigi back to him. Cutter shows him a photo of Gigi on his cell phone that he took of her in the Kentucky hospital. Rex thinks that the picture he has of Gigi is a fake, and he then gets into a fight with Cutter out of total anger towards him for his extortion scheme. Bo then enters the office and breaks up the fight between them, and Cutter leaves the building saying Rex will regret his decision to not take up on his offer to reunite with Gigi. Cutter then goes back to the Kentucky hospital and finds out from the nurse that Stacy checked herself out of her room. Cutter immediately finds Stacy at the cemetery at Gigi's gravesite. Stacy asks Cutter how can she be Gigi if she is dead. Cutter explains to her that she is not Gigi. Cutter is then confronted by Aubrey the next morning, and she says that she knows already that he's scamming Rex by using Rex's deceased fiancée Gigi. Cutter decides to crash the engagement party with Stacy so that when she sees Rex and Shane, she could get her memories back without anyone seeing her at the party. On October 28, Cutter and Stacy arrives at the Buchanan Mansion with Cutter dressed as a mummy, and Stacy dressed as Little Red Riding Hood and a mask hiding her face while they're greeted at the door by Rex. Cutter and Stacy are then invited in to the party. Stacy then tells Cutter that she felt strong feelings towards Rex when she first saw him at the front door. Cutter also keeps an eye out on Stacy as she tries to get her memories back by talking to Rex's son Shane. Cutter and Stacy then leave the party, but not before Cutter finds Kim's letter to Clint that she wrote from prison that he finds on the mansion's front doorsteps. Stacy confronts Cutter about why he's using her to get to Rex. Cutter tells Stacy that he's using her to help her reunite with Rex, and to get the Buchanan fortune from him so they could both benefit what they both want from Rex. Cutter sent a letter he forged from Kim to send to Clint. Cutter also forged a letter from Clint to send to Kim. Cutter made both letters look like that both of them were breaking up with each other, and to not let anyone know about Stacy's identity, and the truth about Cutter framing Kim for the murder he committed at the Spotted Pony. Rex then confronts Cutter for trying to fool him into thinking that the masked woman he brought to the engagement party was Gigi. After Rex left the room, Stacy came out of the bathroom she was hiding in after Rex broke into the room, and told Cutter she wanted out of their deal so that she could get plastic surgery to look like her old self again. On November 14, Cutter goes to the airport to stop Stacy from boarding the plane to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to reverse her plastic surgery. Stacy tells Cutter that she doesn't want to be part of his scam anymore, and that she doesn't want to hurt Rex and Shane's feelings by pretending to be Gigi anymore. Cutter becomes touched by Stacy's change of heart and decides to drop his scam against Rex, and lets Stacy travel to Brazil on the condition that he can come along with her on the trip. At the airport before he and Stacy board their flight, Rex confronts Cutter about passing off Gigi's impostor as his dead fiancée. Cutter tells Rex to leave him alone so that he could leave town with Stacy. Rex then tells Cutter to go away before he sees Stacy with Gigi's face for the first time before she boards the plane to Brazil with Cutter. When both Cutter and Stacy arrived at plastic surgeon Dr. Fascinella's office's waiting room of in Rio, Stacy discovered she did have plastic surgery there when she asked a nurse if she had surgery there after the nurse saw the before and after picture of Stacy's surgery in her file. Cutter then saw his estranged mother Alex Olanov for the first time since he was abandoned by her as a child after he saw her leave the plastic surgeon's office complaining about a botched surgery on her cheek. Cutter then confronted Alex and told her that he is her son. Alex then denies she is his mother, but when he tells her that her husband committed suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a gun after she abandoned the family and taking off with some of his money, Alex broke down in tears and admitted that she is his mother. Cutter then told his mom that he and his sister ended up in the foster care system after their father killed himself because his insurance didn't cover them because of their father's suicide. Alex then told Cutter the reason why she left her family is because she wasn't cut out to be a mother. Alex then told Cutter to speak with her privately to explain her side of the story. After Cutter and Alex stepped into a private room to talk, Cutter then went to his mother to strangle her to avenge her for abandoning her family. Stacy then came into the room to stop Cutter from choking Alex. When Rex and Aubrey arrived at Rio in the waiting room outside, Cutter decided to involve Alex in his scheme to hide Stacy from Rex and Aubrey, so that Alex could make up it to Cutter for abandoning her family. Cutter tied Alex with a bunch of bandages on her face and put her in a wheelchair to fool Aubrey and Rex into thinking it was Gigi behind the bandages when he wheeled her out of the room. Aubrey then untied the bandages to reveal Alex's face. Rex was surprised to see Alex, and Alex lied to Rex, telling him she teamed up with Cutter to pretend she was Gigi in order to get her share of the Buchanan fortune with Cutter, but didn't tell him that she was Cutter and Kim's mother. Rex then believed Cutter and Alex's story (even though he later revealed to Aubrey after they left the doctor's office he didn't really buy their story) and told them he didn't want to be like them, and that he accepted Gigi's death. After Rex and Aubrey left, Alex gave Cutter her business card to him so that he could be in touch with her when he needed her help, and also wished Cutter and Stacy good luck to the both of them before she left to go back to her home in St. Blaze's Island. Cutter then vowed to Stacy that she would get her surgery the next day. On December 1, Cutter comforted Stacy after she woke up from a nightmare about Gigi's death and her being trapped in that rental house basement with the leaking carbon monoxide. He also confided in Stacy about being afraid that he was a lot like his mother because he became a con artist like her, but Stacy reassured Cutter that by going with her to Rio to reverse her plastic surgery and dropping his scam against Rex, that he was on the path to redemption. Cutter then planted a kiss on Stacy! Stacy then pulled away from Cutter after she was surprised that he kissed her off guard. Cutter told Stacy that the reason why he kissed her was because that he's developing feelings for her, and that she's helping him reform his grifting ways by helping her to get surgery to look like her old self again. Cutter and Stacy then got the call from Stacy's plastic surgeon Dr. Fascinella to attend their scheduled appointment. Cutter and Stacy both arrived in Dr. Fascinella's office when he started examining Stacy and noticed something different about her. The doctor then asked Cutter to step outside his office to have a word with him. Dr. Fascinella told Cutter that the woman that was in his office wasn't Stacy, but was the woman that she based her altered looks on which was Gigi! Cutter then realized that Stacy was really Gigi, who turned out to be still alive, and was the one who survived being trapped in that poisoned and contaminated basement, and that Stacy was the one that really died and had her heart donated to Clint. Cutter then went to Gigi, and lied to her saying that the doctor couldn't perform surgery on her because of the carbon monoxide fumes she was exposed to when she was trapped in that basement, and letting her still believe that she was still her deceased sister Stacy, because he was still in love with her as Stacy, but not Gigi. Cutter and Stacy then decided to go to Paris, Texas after they randomly picked out the place on the globe to pick out their next destination to start their new lives together as a couple. When they arrive in Paris, TX, they stop by The Bon Jour Cafe, where Gigi gets a feeling of deja vu, not remembering yet that she once worked there as a waitress a few years ago, and also reunited with Rex there where he met their son Shane for the first time. Cutter agrees with Gigi that she's getting her memories back. Gigi and Cutter then get jobs working at The Bon Jour Cafe as a waitress and a dishwasher respectively. Cutter contemplates telling the truth about her true identity when some of the townsfolk started to recognize Gigi, but decides not to, and suggests that they both leave town together to go live in Paris, France instead, but Gigi decides that she still wants to stay in Paris, TX, and to not leave town with Cutter. Cutter changes his mind after Gigi convinces him to stay in town with her because of the familiarity of her workplace environment. Gigi also kisses Cutter and tells him that she cares about him and their budding romance between them in their relationship. After Cutter leaves The Bon Jour to reserve a motel room for them at The Bon Sweets Motel, Gigi sees that Rex and Viki have just both arrived together at The Bon Jour! Gigi then hides in the back room, and calls Cutter on her cell phone to tell him that Rex and Viki are now in Paris, Texas, at The Bon Jour, and enlists his help to get her out of there before they see her and Cutter. Cutter then hires a preacher he sees at The Bon Jour to distract Viki and Rex while Cutter sneaks Gigi out of The Bon Jour. Cutter and Gigi then check out of their motel room to leave Paris, TX to go their next destination. When Gigi steps out of the room though, she sees that Rex and Shane are also staying at the same motel. Gigi rushes back inside, and tells Cutter that they can't leave yet because Rex and Shane are staying at the motel. Gigi then passes out and remembers that Kim was talking to her after she rescued her from the trapped basement that was leaking carbon monoxide. Gigi also learns from Cutter that Stacy's friend Kim is in prison for murdering a rich guy at The Spotted Pony strip club in Kentucky (unaware that Cutter really committed the murder, and framed Kim for the crime). Cutter agrees to still stay in Paris, Texas, until Viki, Rex, and Shane all leave town. On December 20, Cutter and Gigi prepare to leave town until Cutter was interrupted by the motel clerk to tell him that his payment through his credit card didn't come through, and Gigi sneaked out of the room to go outside. Gigi then arrived back at The Bon Jour Cafe to return her waitress uniform when she saw Rex, Shane, Viki, Moe, and Noelle inside The Bon Jour from standing outside the window. Cutter then found Gigi after he worked out his payment problem to the motel clerk to take Gigi to the airport to board a flight to Las Vegas, Nevada. After Cutter gets the tickets for him and Gigi for the flight to Vegas at the airport, he sees that Gigi has disappeared! Cutter then encounters Professor Delbert Fina Jr., who he asks about Gigi's whereabouts. The professor says he's seen her, but doesn't know where she went after he talked to her a while ago. The professor also tells Cutter to do the right thing and let Gigi go instead of trying to pursue her again. Cutter then arrives back at The Bon Jour Cafe where he breaks up a fight between Rex and Gigi, and finally confesses the truth about \\"Stacy\\" really being Gigi. Rex doesn't believe Cutter, and tells Gigi that Cutter murdered a guy back in Kentucky, and framed his sister Kim for the crime. Rex then ties up Cutter until the police shows up to have him arrested and taken away to a prison in Kentucky. Cutter then calls Aubrey from prison to ask for her help on Christmas Eve (Aubrey later told Rex that she hung up on him after he asked for her help). The next day, Cutter called his sister Kim to help him get out of prison. Cutter also told Kim that it was Gigi, not Stacy, that she rescued from the basement, and that Stacy was the one that died that night in the basement. Cutter also told Kim that he found their mother Alex while he was in Rio, and wanted him and Kim to scam money from her if she helps him break out of prison. Despite his pleas, Kim refused to help Cutter break out of prison after he framed her for his crime, and hung up on her brother. Cutter then calls his mother Alex from the number he got from the business card she gave him back in Rio. =2013= On April 29, 2013, Cutter is now out of prison and back in Llanview and is the manager and club promoter of Blair Cramer's new nightclub Shelter. Cutter meets VIP Hostess Rama (who has recently separated from her husband Vimal) inside the club and they flirt with each other before they wish each other luck on the club's opening night. He also meets Natalie at the club, where she isn't happy to see him because of his past as a con artist. Cutter tells Natalie to let \\"bygones be bygones\\", and that he's a changed man now working for Blair at the club. Cutter then shares a seductive dance with Natalie before they're both interrupted by Rama because of an emergency. Cutter tells Natalie that they'll pick up where they left off later. After Danielle Manning overdoses on OxyContin pills, Cutter tries to do damage control by convincing Rama to poor free shots for the patrons. He also asks one of his employees Dean Trayger if he sold Dani any drugs, and he says no. Cutter then tells Rama that he's worried that he'll get in trouble with his boss Blair if she finds out that Dani took drugs in her club. Rama asks Cutter if he gave drugs to Dani, and he says he didn't give her any drugs. Rama believes him and tells him not to worry about it. After the patrons all get too drunk and rowdy, Cutter then tells everyone to go home. On May 2, Dean brings police officer Bruce Hunter to Cutter. Cutter thinks the cop is arresting him for Dani's overdose at the club, but Dean reassures him that he's on their side and will work as a security guard at the club. Cutter then agrees to hire Bruce and tells Dean to not tell him any details. On May 7, Cutter meets his old friend Jamie Franko, a shady art dealer from Miami, Florida in the VIP room at Shelter, saying that he owes him money. Cutter tries to make Jamie happy by making him comfortable in the VIP room by providing him with expensive wine, but Jamie is still not satisfied and wants his money from Cutter. After Jamie offers Cutter the services of Rama to pay off his debt, Cutter tells Jamie that Rama isn't for sale, and he eventually pays Jamie the money he owed him, and he also kicks him out of the club. On May 14, Cutter buys Natalie a drink from a bartender that he hired at Shelter named Nikki (Jenni \\"JWoww\\" Farley), who made the drink and named it after her boss Cutter (who she occasionally sleeps with). Cutter and Natalie takes a sip of the drink, but both doesn't like the taste of the drink that Nikki made. Cutter then tells his boss Blair that he's auditioning a singer named Dusky (Jessie Malakouti) to perform at Shelter. Despite making an initial bad impression by asking Rama for a drink even though she's underage, Dusky impresses Blair, Natalie, Rama, and the patrons at the club with her performance, and Blair hires her on the spot. Cutter also finds out that Nikki didn't serve his singer a drink despite being underage. Nikki then tells Cutter that even though she sometimes has casual sex with him, she doesn't appreciate him bringing other girls with him right in front of her because it makes her feel jealous. The next day, Blair argued with Cutter that he was going to put Shelter out of business because of pricing and money issues that she's been having with him. Blair also told Cutter that while she liked Nikki the bartender, she thinks that she could be trouble for the club. Cutter reassured Blair that Nikki is a good bartender with a great following that will attract customers to the club, and that the club will make them much money if they keep attracting more satisfied customers to the club. Blair told Cutter that although she is skeptical of his promises, she hopes that he was right about the club being very successful for the both of them. On May 16, Cutter visits The Coffee Shop and is surprised to hear from David and Vimal there that Vimal and Rama are having an open marriage. Vimal tells Cutter not to get any ideas about sleeping with Rama. Vimal tells Cutter and David that he is unsure about his open marriage with Rama, because she was the only woman that he's been with for most of his life. Cutter and David then tell Vimal to date other women to make his open marriage with Rama work since she'll be dating other men as well. On May 21, Cutter offers Natalie and her friend Destiny Evans free drinks from behind the bar at the club. After Natalie dances with Destiny on the dance floor and Destiny leaves for work, Cutter asks Natalie out on a date which she accepts before she leaves the club to tend to her son Liam McBain. On May 23, Cutter runs into Natalie at The Coffee Shop to tell her that he forgot about her date because he would be working on the day of their scheduled date, and they both agrees to postpone their date to another day when both of them weren't busy with work. On May 28, Cutter had a meeting with his employees telling them that he hired a singer named Dusky at the club, and to respect her and not make a pass at her because she's only 20 years old. Cutter then meets up with Dusky when she arrives at the club to give her the tour of the place and introduce her to his employees before she signs her contract with Blair. Cutter later sees Natalie at the front door of the club waiting in line and invites her in through the velvet ropes. On May 30, Cutter offers Natalie to serve her favorite drink at the bar, and orders Nikki to make her a stiff cosmo because she's amazing. Nikki tells Natalie that he says that to every sexy lady that comes to the club, which makes Natalie thinks that Cutter hasn't changed his grifting ways. Cutter tells her that he can prove to her that he's a changed man, but Natalie asks if he's running any illegal activities in the club. Cutter responds by saying that everything he's doing at the club is legit. Cutter then dances with Natalie before he leaves her for a few minutes, but Natalie doesn't want to be alone, and Cutter gets the club's security guard Bruce Hunter to dance with her who she knows by working with him at the police station since he works as a cop during the day. Natalie then asks Bruce if Cutter hired him to provide security for the place, or to help him cover up shady dealings in the club. Bruce tells Natalie he doesn't know what she's talking about before she glances at Dean giving a stash of drugs to one of the club's DJs before the lights went out. Cutter and Bruce then scramble to get flashlights for the patrons and to calm everyone down. Cutter later runs up to Natalie to surprise her with a passionate kiss. On June 4, Cutter tells Blair that the blackout at Shelter was no accident, which her ex-husband agrees with him because he told both of them that someone cut the power cord that caused the blackout. Cutter thinks that the mob might be responsible for the blackout and that it might be connected to Dani's OD on the night of the club's opening. On June 11, Cutter asks Blair if he could use her office in the club, but Blair thinks he wants to use it for his pleasure as his personal playground, but he reassures her saying that he's interviewing a couple of ladies for cocktail waitressing jobs for the club. Cutter later sees a depressed Natalie at the bar and tells the bartender to give her a free drink. Cutter asks Natalie what's wrong and Natalie tells him she feels distracted. Cutter tells Natalie to call him anytime when she wants to get \\"undistracted\\". Cutter then leaves the bar to interview the two ladies for the waitressing jobs, but keeps looking over at Natalie from a distance. On June 13, Blair comes up to Cutter and tells her to shut down the club which Cutter refuses to do until she tells him that she and Todd were almost shot at outside the club by a mysterious gunman and that she wants to call the police. Cutter and Todd doesn't want the police to get involved, but Blair convinces them to let her do it because she's scared for her and the lives of Todd and their children. Cutter then cave in to Blair's demands and has the club closed, and a police officer arrives at the club to question Cutter about the shooting. On June 18, Bo questions Cutter about the night of the shooting at the crime scene outside of the club while investigating with Bruce and the other cops on the scene. Cutter tells him that he only knows what Blair told him about the night of the shooting, and he hopes that the club can survive the horrible incident which Bo also hopes for too for Blair's sake. One of the police officers investigating the crime scene thinks that the club was the intended target, and Bo thinks that it wouldn't be the first time that the mob would send out a message to a new club owner. Bo then asks Cutter if the blackout was intentional or caused by faulty wiring before he was interrupted by a phone call. Bo then hangs up a minute later and relays the message to Cutter that the crime lab tested the Oxycontin pill that Dani took on the club's opening night, and that it was a normal dose that was four times the strength of a normal dose, and that Dani would've died if she wasn't taken to the hospital so quickly. On June 20, Bo informs Cutter that the Briana Marland, a college student and a prostitute that was one of Shelter's patrons, was found dead from a drug overdose in her hotel room at The Palace Hotel. Bo asks if there are any drugs being sold at the club, and Cutter just gives him a nervous laugh. Bo then tells Cutter that he'll have narcotics officers investigate the club before he leaves. Bruce reassures Cutter that he'll take care of the narcs himself. Cutter then talks to Dean to ask him if he knew of any tainted drugs being sold on the streets, and Dean tells him he doesn't know of any tainted drugs that are being sold on the market. Rama then comes up to him an asks him why he care so much about Brianna's death, and Cutter tells her that he's concerned about the club, and that people don't just drop dead from taking drugs, and that people that attend the club using and being killed by tainted drugs can cause the club to lose money. Later, Cutter asks Nikki to give Dusky a drink before her performance at the club, even though she's underage and much to a jealous Nikki's chagrin, who notices that Dusky is flirting with Cutter. On June 27, Cutter attends Briana's memorial service at Shelter and instructs Rama to give the guests whatever they want because Arturo Bandini, who was Briana's boyfriend (and who was also older than her) at the time of her death and had rented the club for her memorial service, is a wealthy man that will pay for everything. Cutter then also instructs his employees Dean and Diego that since Bruce was busy at his day job as a cop, to make sure that no drugs were present at the club during the service. Cutter later told Dean to show some respect during the service after he made some sarcastic remarks about Briana and Dani overdosing on drugs while Dani was paying her respects in her eulogy during her former college classmate and late friend's memorial service. On July 1, Cutter cooperates with Bo in his investigation of Briana's death at Shelter by giving him a copy of the receipt that was given to Jason Murray, another older man who was Briana's date (and the man that she was cheating on Arturo with to score drugs from him) at the time of her death. Later, Nikki confronts Cutter and accuses him of sleeping with Briana after he helped Bo with his investigation of her death (and when Cutter also got a bit emotional during Briana's memorial service), and Cutter denies having ever slept with Briana when she was alive, and Nikki tells him to stay out of whatever trouble he's involved in with the police, and that Natalie wouldn't be pleased with the fact that he once slept with Briana. Cutter tells Nikki that his relationship with Natalie isn't exclusive, and Nikki replies back saying that their relationship isn't exclusive either. On July 8, Cutter arrives at Natalie's apartment with flowers and a bottle of patron tequila for her, but is surprised to find out that Natalie's friend Destiny is there with her date and co-worker from The Banner Jeffrey Wright, and he figures out that he's on a double date with the three of them. Cutter is soon called away from his double date from Rama, who needs him to tend to an emergency at Shelter. Cutter arrives at Shelter, but is disappointed to find out from Rama that it was only a minor problem when she told him that the ice maker broke. Cutter later calls Natalie to apologize to her for walking out of their double date, and he'll make it up to her by going on another date alone with each other, which Natalie happily accepts. On July 15, Cutter arrives unannounced at Natalie's apartment, but she closes the door on him because her place is a mess and she hasn't prepared herself for him. Natalie then opens the door and lets Cutter in her apartment after she's more prepared for him and has her place cleaned up. They both share a pizza together and have wine Cutter brought over before they make love to each other for the first time on the floor in her apartment. On July 22, Cutter is approached by Rama at Shelter to tell Dorian to not fire her from her job at Shelter after her brief tryst with her husband David. Cutter then meets with Dorian and tells her that he can't fire Rama because if he does fire her, that she could sue him for wrongful termination, and that he could sue Dorian as well! Cutter and Dorian then both agree to make a compromise that Rama should always stay away from her every time she attends Shelter. Cutter later has drinks with Natalie at Shelter, where he learns of her childhood growing up in a trailer park in Atlantic City, NJ with her adoptive mom Roxy before discovering that she had a rich biological family in Llanview. Cutter told Natalie that he could relate to her about the both of them growing up on the wrong side of the tracks. Natalie then told Cutter that she doesn't want him to mess around with her by cheating on her with other women if they're both going to be in a relationship with each other. On July 29, Rama asked Cutter about where Natalie was, and he said that she went home after their date together, and that Natalie wanted to take things slow with \\"no strings attached\\". Rama told Cutter that \\"strings\\" are good thing. Cutter also confided in Rama that he felt lonely without Natalie. Later, Cutter found Natalie's father Clint intoxicated outside of Shelter after he got into an altercation with the club's doorman Diego Padilla when he wouldn't let him in the club. Cutter told Diego to not press charges against Clint after their fight, and Clint's brother Bo soon arrived at the scene to take Clint to his apartment. Cutter then went inside Shelter to call Natalie to tell her that he found his father drunk outside the club, and he'll come over to her apartment to tell her about all the details. After he called Natalie, Cutter told Niki that he was leaving the club for a little while to go to Natalie's apartment after he found her father intoxicated outside the club. Nikki then accuses Cutter of using this incident to get close to Natalie. Cutter told Nikki that he wanted to tell Natalie this news to her at her place rather than over the phone. Nikki then asked Cutter why he was being so caring all of a sudden, and Cutter told her that he had learned to be caring thanks to past mistakes in his life. Nikki asked Cutter if she was one of her \\"past mistakes\\". Cutter then told her to \\"chill out\\" and that he'll come back to the club before it closes. Cutter then arrived at Natalie's apartment to tell her about her drunken father's altercation with Diego outside the club and that he also convinced Diego to not press any charges against Clint, and Natalie wanted to leave to go see her father, but he reassured her that he was alright and was at his brother's apartment. Natalie told Cutter that she felt bad about her father Clint because he had gotten drunk after Viki called off her engagement to him. Cutter told Natalie that he knew how her father felt because he had done crazy things over a woman before he comforted her by kissing her after saying that \\"he got her back\\". Cutter later confided in Natalie that he doesn't like working at Shelter because it doesn't make him happy with how unglamorous it can be at times, even though Natalie was envious of his job at the club, but Cutter told her that he had to pretend to be having a good time at the club to please the patrons and his employees and that he rather have her quiet and stable life instead. On August 5, after Cutter spends the night at Natalie's apartment, she gets a call from her Uncle Bo at the police station the next morning to go pick up her father after he was arrested and spent the night in jail. Natalie then kicks Cutter out of her apartment after thinking that her father was arrested because Diego sued Clint for punching him out outside of Shelter. Cutter later went to The Coffee Shop and was approached by Bruce to tell him that Bo would be investigating the club again after Bo suspected that there was a call girl ring at the club. On August 12, Cutter told Blair about Diego getting punched out by an unruly patron outside of Shelter, and Blair wanted to press charges on the patron until Cutter told her that the culprit was Clint, and that he wanted her to reconsider suing Clint before he receives his Man of the Year award at the gala at Shelter. Cutter soon paid a visit to Clint's office at Buchanan Enterprises to tell him that he convinced Diego to not press charges against him and to pay Diego his medical bills instead so that the club wouldn't get anymore negative publicity. Clint refused to pay Diego, and Cutter then threatened to get a lawyer of his own after he failed to make a compromise with Clint. Cutter later went back to Shelter to tell Diego that Clint refused to pay his medical bills, and Diego blamed him for not trying hard enough to convince Clint to pay him because he was dating his daughter. Natalie then came in the club to accuse Cutter of extorting money from Clint after she paid a visit to her father's office right after he did, but Cutter said that he just wanted to convince her father to pay Diego's medical bills since he didn't have any insurance. Natalie then told Cutter and Diego that she'll talk to a lawyer herself so that she'll convince Clint to pay Diego's medical bills. Cutter then thanked Natalie for during a huge favor for him and Diego before Natalie apologized for falsely accusing Cutter of extorting money from her father. Natalie also told Cutter that she recently learned by listening to the radio in her car before coming to the club that Clint was no longer being awarded the Man of the Year award because of the video that leaked of Clint's drunken altercation with Diego that was taken by a patron outside of Shelter, and that someone else in his place would receive the award instead. Cutter and Natalie then made plans to meet at Shelter again that night to attend the Man of the Year gala together. On August 19 (the first- season finale of OLTL 2.0), Cutter and Natalie arrive at the gala at Shelter to see her Uncle Bo be awarded The Man of the Year in place of her father Clint. When Natalie comes over to the bar to order Martinis for her and Cutter from Nikki during the auction portion of the gala, she confesses to Natalie that she and Cutter have been sleeping together for months and that he has no plans of stopping their sexual relationship before she goes back to her seat at her table with Cutter. Cutter then asks Natalie when their drinks will arrive at their table, and Natalie responds that she doesn't know, and that since the auction is almost over, that he could give a \\"blow job\\" to Nikki at the bar. Cutter then told Natalie that it's not what it looks like between her and Nikki, and that she's full of herself, but Natalie told him that she knew how she felt about him cheating on her and is making it worse by lying to her about his relationship with Nikki. Cutter tried to tell Natalie that he wasn't cheating on her before Nikki spilled the drinks that she was serving to them on Natalie's dress on purpose. Natalie then bolted to the bathroom with Rama to clean up her dress. Cutter then tried to restrain Clint with Dean after a drunk and drugged Clint crashed the award presentation before Clint is taken to the hospital. Cutter then asked Natalie if he could offer her a ride to the hospital to see her father, but she declined his offer. Cutter then went after Natalie outside of the club to try to apologize to her before she told him that her father's health was more important than him and Nikki, and Natalie then left him to go to the hospital with her cousin Matthew Buchanan and his girlfriend Michelle McCall. Cutter then went to tell Diego why he would let Clint inside the club. Diego then told him that he let Clint inside Shelter after he paid him $100,000 to pay for his medical bills. Cutter then went inside the club to tell Nikki why she would tell Natalie about their sexual relationship. Nikki told him that she felt like she needed to tell Natalie about her sexual relationship with him. Cutter then told Nikki that he was the non-commitment type, but Nikki believed that Natalie didn't know that about him before she told him to start helping the staff to clean up the club. After the gala was over and everyone else left the club, Cutter confronted Nikki about why she wanted to ruin his date with Natalie at the gala before Nikki left the club to go home. Nikki told him that he used her to have sex with her, but Cutter then told her that even though he liked her a lot, his relationship with her was never really a serious commitment with her in the first place, and if she didn't like him moving on to Natalie, that she should just quit her job at the club. Nikki then tells him that she refuses to quit her job because she loves her bartending job at the club, and that they still have \\"business\\" to take care of in the club. Cutter also told Nikki that their personal connection together shouldn't come between their \\"business\\" with each other, and that he wanted to go in a different direction in his life with Natalie. Nikki then kissed Cutter and told him that his relationship with Natalie wouldn't work out because she wouldn't be enough for him to satisfy his sexual needs before she left the club to go home.

Credited as a persuasive figure in the movement to racially integrate sports, Lacy in 1948 became the first black member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. In 1997, he received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing from the BBWAA, which placed him in the writers' and broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998. Upbringing Lacy was born on October 23, 1903, in Mystic, Connecticut to Samuel Erskine Lacy, a law firm researcher, and Rose Lacy, a full-blooded Shinnecock. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when Sam was a young boy. In his youth he developed a love for baseball, and spent his spare time at Griffith Stadium, home ballpark for the Washington Senators. His house at 13th and U streets was just five blocks from the stadium, and Sam would often run errands for players and chase down balls during batting practice. In his youth Sam witnessed racist mistreatment of his family while they watched the annual Senators' team parade through the streets of Washington to the stadium on opening day. Sam later recalled what happened after his elderly father cheered and waved an \\"I Saw Walter Johnson Pitch\\" pennant: As a teenager Sam worked for the Senators as a food vendor, selling popcorn and peanuts in the stadium's segregated Jim Crow section in right field. Lacy also caddied for British golfer Long Jim Barnes at the 1921 U.S. Open, held at nearby Columbia Country Club. When Barnes won the tournament, he gave Lacy a $200 tip. Lacy graduated from Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, where he played football, baseball, and basketball. He enrolled at Howard University, where in 1923 he earned a bachelor's degree in physical education, a field he thought might lead him to a coaching career. Lacy played semi-pro baseball after college, pitching for the local Hillsdale club in Washington. He also refereed DC-area high school, college and recreational basketball games, while coaching and instructing youth sports teams. Early career While in college, Lacy began covering sports part-time for the Washington Tribune, a local African-American newspaper. He continued writing for the paper following his graduation, and also worked as a sports commentator for radio stations WOL and WINX in the early 1930s. He joined the Tribune full- time in 1926, and became sports editor shortly thereafter. In 1929 Lacy left the paper for the summer to play semi-pro baseball in Connecticut while his family remained in Washington. He returned to the paper in 1930, and once again became sports editor in 1933. During his tenure Lacy covered Jesse Owens' medal-winning performances at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, the world heavyweight title fights of boxer Joe Louis (including his victory over Max Schmeling), and the rise of Negro League stars such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell. In 1936 Lacy began lobbying Senators owner Clark Griffith to consider adding star players from the Negro Leagues; in particular, those playing for the Homestead Grays team that leased Griffith Stadium for its home games. He finally gained a face-to-face meeting with Griffith on the subject in December 1937. Griffith listened but was not keen on the idea, as Lacy later told a Philadelphia reporter: Lacy also wrote that Griffith voiced concern that the fall of the Negro Leagues would \\"put about 400 colored guys out of work.\\" Lacy retorted in a column, \\"When Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, he put 400,000 black people out of jobs.\\" In October 1937, Lacy broke his first major story when he reported the true racial origins of multi-sport athlete Wilmeth Sidat-Singh. Syracuse University had claimed Sidat-Singh was of Hindu and Indian heritage, when in truth his widowed mother had remarried, to an Indian doctor. Prior to a football game against the University of Maryland, Lacy revealed Sidat-Singh had been born to black parents in Washington, D.C., and trumpeted the news as a sign the color barrier at segregated Maryland was about to fall. When Maryland officials refused to play the game unless Sidat-Singh was barred from the field, Syracuse removed him from the team and lost the match 13-0. The controversy prompted an outcry against both schools' policies and actions, and Sidat-Singh was allowed to play against Maryland the following year as he led Syracuse to a decisive 53-0 win. Lacy drew criticism in some circles for divulging Sidat-Singh's ethnicity, but maintained his stance that racial progress demanded honesty. The 1940s In August 1941 Lacy moved to Chicago to work for another black newspaper, the Chicago Defender, where he served as its assistant national editor. While in the Midwest he made repeated attempts to engage Major League Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on the topic of desegregating the game, writing numerous letters, but his efforts went unanswered. Lacy also targeted blacks in management and ownership positions with the Negro Leagues, some of whom had a vested financial interest in keeping the game segregated. In a Defender editorial, he wrote: On January 4, 1944, Lacy returned East, joining the Afro-American in Baltimore as sports editor and columnist. He continued to press his case for integrating baseball through his columns and editorials, and many other black newspapers followed suit. In one such piece in 1945, Lacy wrote: However, Lacy did not make any headway on the issue until Landis died in late 1944. Lacy began a dialogue with Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, and Landis's successor in the commissioner's office, Happy Chandler, lent his support to the effort. It ultimately led to Jackie Robinson signing with the Dodgers' minor league team, the Montreal Royals on October 23, 1945, which was Lacy's 42nd birthday. Lacy spent the next three years covering Jackie's struggle for acceptance and a spot in the big leagues. He traveled with Robinson to the Royals' games at various International League cities throughout the Northeast, to the Dodgers' spring training site in Daytona Beach, Florida, to competing clubs' camps throughout the deep South, and to Cuba for winter baseball. Like Robinson and the other black athletes he had covered, Lacy encountered racist indignities and hardships. He was barred from press boxes at certain ballparks, dined at the same segregated restaurants with Jackie, and stayed at the same \\"blacks only\\" boarding houses as Robinson. Robinson would eventually break MLB's color barrier in 1947 with the Dodgers, but Lacy never allowed their racial bond to cloud his journalistic objectivity. During spring training in 1948, Lacy chastised Robinson in print for arriving 15 pounds overweight, his \\"lackadaisical attitude\\" and for \\"laying down\\" on the job. He also plastered details of Robinson's personal life throughout his articles, including the dining, shopping, wardrobe and travel habits of Jackie and his wife, Rachel. Lacy resisted having his own personal bouts with racism become part of the integration storyline, and kept the focus on the athletes he covered: Lacy made sure to cover all angles of the race issue. In 1947, he reported on the interaction between white St. Louis Browns outfielder and rumored racist Paul Lehner, and his black teammate Willard Brown: In 1948, he reacted to the death of Babe Ruth not with adulation for the star but with spite toward Ruth's personal behavior: Lacy covered the first interracial college football game ever played in the state of Maryland when all-black Maryland State College faced all-white Trenton (N.J.) College in 1949: Later career Not content to see black ballplayers reach the major leagues, Lacy began pushing for equal pay for athletes of color, and for an end to segregated team accommodations during road trips. His first success on those fronts was persuading New York Giants general manager Chub Feeney to address the latter issue: Over the ensuing decades, Lacy pushed for the Baseball Hall of Fame to induct deserving Negro League players, and later criticized the Hall for placing such players in a separate wing. He also pressured national TV networks over the lack of black broadcasters, criticized Major League Baseball for the absence of black umpires, targeted corporations for their lack of sponsorships of black athletes in certain white-dominated sports including golf, and highlighted the National Football League's dearth of black head coaches. Stories covered extensively by Lacy included the Grand Slam tennis titles won by Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe two decades apart, Wilma Rudolph's three track & field gold medals at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, and Lee Elder playing at Augusta National in 1975 as the first black golfer in The Masters tournament. In 1954, Lacy questioned why the city of Milwaukee had chosen to honor Braves outfielder Hank Aaron with a day in his honor a mere two months into his playing career: Lacy worked as a television sports commentator for WBAL-TV from 1968 to 1976. Lacy remained with the Baltimore Afro-American for nearly 60 years, and became widely known for his regular \\"A to Z\\" columns and his continued championing of racial equity. The onset of arthritis in his hands in his late 70s left him unable to type, so he wrote his columns out longhand. Even into his 80s he maintained his routine of waking at 3 A.M. three days a week, driving from his Washington home to his Baltimore office, working eight hours, and playing nine holes of golf in the afternoon. Lacy could no longer drive after a suffering a stroke in 1999, so he rode to the office with his son, Tim, who followed in his footsteps as a sportswriter for the Afro- American. In 1999, Lacy teamed with colleague Moses J. Newson, a former executive editor at the Afro-American, to write his autobiography, Fighting for Fairness: The Life Story of Hall of Fame Sportswriter Sam Lacy. Sam Lacy wrote his final column for the paper just days before his death at age 99 in 2003, and filed the piece from his hospital bed. In 1999, he explained his rationale for staying with the Afro-American while spurning more lucrative offers: Personal life Sam Lacy married Alberta Robinson in 1927. They had a son, Samuel Howe (Tim) Lacy, and a daughter, Michaelyn T. Lacy (now Michaelyn Harris). Sam and Alberta divorced in 1952, and Sam married Barbara Robinson in 1953. Barbara died in 1969, but Sam never remarried. As of December 2010, Tim Lacy remains a columnist at the Afro-American at the age of 72. Lacy's paternal grandfather, Henry Erskine Lacy, was the first black detective in the Washington, D.C., police department. Death Sam Lacy died at age 99 of heart and kidney failure on May 8, 2003, at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. He had checked into the hospital a week earlier due to a loss of appetite. Besides his children, survivors included four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. His funeral was held on May 16, 2003, at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., with burial at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland. Awards and honors In 1948, Lacy became the first black member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. In 1984, Lacy became the first black journalist to be enshrined in the Maryland Media Hall of Fame. In 1985, Lacy was inducted into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame in Las Vegas. In 1991, Lacy received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Black Journalists.

Lacy also threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to a Baltimore Orioles home game at Camden Yards that season. On October 22, 1997, Lacy received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The award carries induction to the writers and broadcasters wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Lacy was formally enshrined on July 26, 1998. In 1998, Lacy received the Frederick Douglass Award from the University System of Maryland on April 23; the United Negro College Fund established a scholarship program in Lacy's name on April 25; and he received the Red Smith Award from the Associated Press on June 26. In 2003, the Sports Task Force wing of the National Association of Black Journalists instituted the Sam Lacy Pioneer Award, presented annually to multiple sports figures in the host city for the NABJ convention. Recipients are selected based on their \\"contributions to their respected careers, but more importantly, their direct impact on the communities they served.\\" Lacy also served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and on the Baseball Hall of Fame's selection committee for the Negro leagues.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 27 *Liberal Democrat 25 *Independent 2 Campaign Before the election the Liberal Democrats had 27 seats on the council, the Conservatives 26 and there was 1 independent. The campaign saw the national leaders of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, Iain Duncan Smith and Charles Kennedy, visit Harrogate to support their parties. The Liberal Democrats defended their record in control of the council, pointing to an improvement in the council finances, providing new facilities for the area, keeping Harrogates portion of the council tax rises low and tackling anti-social behaviour. However the Conservatives attacked \\"over intensive housing development\\" for causing traffic congestion, said they were the only party opposed to congestion charging, proposed to provide an hours free parking for residents and to work with police to tackle anti-social behaviour. Election result The results saw no party win a majority on the council, but the Conservatives became the largest party with 27 seats, compared to 25 for the Liberal Democrats and 2 independents. The Conservatives gained Bilton and High Harrogate wards from the Liberal Democrats, the latter by 656 votes to 610 after a recount. These gains came despite the Liberal Democrats winning slightly more votes overall in the election, 46.5% compared to 44.7% for the Conservatives. However the Conservatives did lose one seats in Ripon Moorside, which was taken by independent Charles Powell. Meanwhile, Labour failed to win any seats and only came second in Woodfield ward. Overall turnout in the election was 34.7%. Following the election the Conservatives took control of the council, with Conservative Mike Gardner becoming council leader, replacing Liberal Democrat Geoff Webber. Meanwhile, the outgoing mayor of Harrogate Alan Skidmore quit the Liberal Democrats after the election to become an independent, criticising the party both nationally and locally.

Life He was the son of William G. Angel (1790–1858) and Clarissa (English) Angel. In 1858, he moved to California, and later to Washington Territory. In 1862, he was elected to a three-year term in the Washington Territorial Council (the forerunner of the Washington State Senate), but attended only the session of 1863, then resigned and returned to Sacramento. In 1865, he returned to New York, studied law with his brother Wilkes Angel (1817–1889), was admitted to the bar at Buffalo in 1867, and commenced practice in partnership with his brother Wilkes at Belmont. In 1868, he removed to Morrisania, then in Westchester County, and resumed his law practice there in partnership with his brother William P. Angel (1813–1869). On May 21, 1871, he married Addie L.

Early life Jones-Jennings was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee to Valentina Jones and is one of five children, the other four are sisters. He attended Howard School of Academics and Technology. While playing for the school's basketball team, he helped guide them to three district championships, two regional championships and two appearances in the state tournament while averaging 10 points and 12 rebounds per game. He graduated in 2002 with a 3.3 GPA. College career =Chattanooga State CC= Rather than head right off to a four-year college or university out of high school, Jones-Jennings stayed in Chattanooga and attended Chattanooga State Community College (CSCC) for two years. As a power forward / center, he earned all-conference honors in both seasons. During his sophomore year, his final at CSCC, he averaged 16.3 points and 14.0 rebounds per game. His rebounding effort ranked second nationally. Jones-Jennings earned many accolades, including NJCAA Division I Third-Team All-American honors, the TJCAA and Eastern Division Most Valuable Player awards, as well as spots on the All-TJCAA and All-Eastern Division teams. =Arkansas–Little Rock= After a standout junior college career, Jones-Jennings was awarded an athletic scholarship to play basketball at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. He spent his junior and senior seasons of NCAA eligibility playing for the Trojans. In his first season, he was dubbed the Sun Belt Conference Newcomer of the Year and a Third Team All-Conference selection after finishing the year ranked third nationally with 11.3 rebounds per game. This total also led the Sun Belt. On December 13, 2005 he became just the tenth NCAA Division I men's basketball player since 1973 to record 30 or more rebounds in a single game. He grabbed exactly 30 rebounds against in-state rival Arkansas–Pine Bluff. He was the first Division I player in six years and just the second since 1994 to accomplish the feat. Jones-Jennings had a great all-around impact in his first season at UALR as he led the team in rebounding, minutes played, minutes per game, blocked shots, total points, field goals made, free throws made and free throw attempts. Entering his final college season in 2006–07, he was only one of eight returning players nationally to have averaged a double-double the year before. He also returned as the nation's top rebounder. Although the Trojans did not qualify for a postseason tournament in either of his two seasons, Jones-Jennings did garner much personal success, especially in his senior season. For the year, he recorded 18 double-doubles, 24 double-digit rebounding efforts and had three games with 20 or more rebounds, including a 25-point, 20-rebound performance against Texas State. He led Division I in rebounding on the year while averaging 13.1 per game in 30 games played. He was also a First Team All- Conference selection as he would go on to finish his Division I career with 731 points and 475 rebounds in 59 career games. Professional career Despite a successful collegiate career, Jones-Jennings was not selected in the 2007 NBA Draft. He played for the Philadelphia 76ers in that summer's Las Vegas Summer League but did not make the final regular season roster. He then signed with Ago Rethimno Almeco in Greece in December, but ultimately did not play a game for them the entire season. Over the next two and a half years, Jones-Jennings became somewhat of a journeyman, playing professionally for teams in Germany, Ukraine, France and Mexico before ending up with Pure-Youth Construction Basketball Team in the Super Basketball League of Taiwan in December 2010. He signed with Osorno Básquetbol of the Chilean Liga Nacional Movistar for the 2013–14 season.

While well known in China, his work is little-known in the United States. Kos-Read uses the stage name Cao Cao, which is also the name of the penultimate chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, a historical figure well-known to most Chinese people. Early life and education Kos-Read was born in Torrance, California, in 1973. He attended the film and acting schools of New York University, but completed his university career there studying molecular biology. Kos-Read began studying Mandarin Chinese at New York University, and re-located to China in 1997. His first acting role was in 1999. Career Kos-Read's roles have included: My Fair Gentleman (2009) (co-starring Kelly Lin and Sun Honglei), Empire of Silver (2009, also starring Aaron Kwok and Jennifer Tilly), and Fit Lover (2008, also starring Nie Bing). Kos-Read has also been featured on Here Comes Cao Cao, a reality program about his life broadcast on Beijing Television. The title of the show was a reference to the Chinese proverb \\"Speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao will be there\\" (\\"说曹操曹操就到\\"), roughly equivalent to the English saying, \\"Speak of the devil.\\" He has starred in more than 75 productions. As a Caucasian who is fully fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Kos-Read frequently appears as the foreign love interest or villain, in roles that sometimes present stereotypical images of non-Chinese people. In 2009, he also appeared on stage with Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra in a Mandarin-language version of the orchestra's multi-media concert piece \\"The Galileo Project: Music of the Spheres,\\" in performances in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Kos-Read was one of those chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its way to the Olympic Stadium.

This is true in dimensions n at most 8, but false in dimensions n at least 9. The problem is named for Sergei Natanovich Bernstein who solved the case n = 3 in 1914. Statement Suppose that f is a function of n − 1 real variables. The graph of f is a surface in Rn, and the condition that this is a minimal surface is that f satisfies the minimal surface equation :\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_i}}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_j}\\\\right)^2}} = 0 Bernstein's problem asks whether an entire function (a function defined throughout Rn−1 ) that solves this equation is necessarily a degree-1 polynomial. History proved Bernstein's theorem that a graph of a real function on R2 that is also a minimal surface in R3 must be a plane. gave a new proof of Bernstein's theorem by deducing it from the fact that there is no non-planar area-minimizing cone in R3. showed that if there is no non- planar area-minimizing cone in Rn−1 then the analogue of Bernstein's theorem is true in Rn, which in particular implies that it is true in R4. showed there are no non-planar minimizing cones in R4, thus extending Bernstein's theorem to R5. showed there are no non-planar minimizing cones in R7, thus extending Bernstein's theorem to R8. He also gave examples of locally stable cones in R8 and asked if they were globally area-minimizing. showed that Simons' cones are indeed globally minimizing, and showed that in Rn for n≥9 there are graphs that are minimal but not hyperplanes. Combined with the result of Simons, this shows that the analogue of Bernstein's theorem is true in dimensions up to 8, and false in higher dimensions. A specific example is the surface \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^8 : x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2=x_5^2+x_6^2+x_7^2+x_8^2 \\\\\\\\}.

Illinois, 406 U.S. 682 (1972), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach during a pre-indictment identification.R.J. Allen, J.L. Hoffman, D.A. Livingston, and W.J. Stuntz. Comprehensive Criminal Procedure, Second Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York: 2005, p. 258 Factual background On February 21, 1968 in Chicago, Willie Shard reported to police that he was robbed by two men that had taken his wallet. The wallet contained his Social Security card and traveler's checks. On February 22, 1968, police stopped Thomas Kirby and Ralph Bean and asked for identification. Kirby produced a Social Security card bearing the name Willie Shard, and police noticed he also carried traveler's checks. Kirby said he won them in a game, but he and Bean were arrested and taken to the police station.Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 684 (1972) Shard was brought to the police station, and upon seeing Kirby and Bean seated at a table identified them as the men who robbed him. Kirby and Bean did not have counsel present, and they had not been advised of their rights. Kirby and Bean were indicted six weeks later for the robbery of Shard, where they were appointed counsel. A pretrial motion by Kirby to exclude the police station identification was denied. A jury convicted both defendants of robbery. Kirby's conviction was affirmed on appeal, where the Illinois appellate court held that the Supreme Court precedents United States v. Wade388 U.S. 218 and Gilbert v. California388 U.S. 263 did not require exclusion of the identification because it was made before the indictment.People v. Kirby, 121 Ill.App.2d 323 The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if Kirby had a right to counsel at that pre-indictment showup identification.402 U.S. 995 Judgment of the Court =Plurality opinion= In a plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Blackmun and Rehnquist, Justice Stewart held that Kirby did not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the showup because it occurred before the beginning of the criminal prosecution. The Court observed that Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel only attaches during the criminal prosecution. A pre-indictment showup, however, could not be considered within the formal realm of the criminal proceeding, because it was a routine police procedure and not a situation where the suspect is faced with \\"the prosecutorial forces of organized society.\\"Kirby, 406 U.S. at 690 The plurality observed that other protections were available to criminal suspects at the pre-indictment identification stage, and that identifications could be excluded on a case by case basis if they were overly suggestive according to Stovall v. Denno.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 691 =Burger's concurrence= Chief Justice Burger's concurrence asserted that a criminal prosecution only begins once charges are formally filed against a defendant, and because that had not yet happened by the time of the identification here, Kirby had no constitutional right to counsel.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 691 (Burger, C.J., concurring) =Powell's concurrence= Justice Powell concurred because he did not want to extend the exclusionary rule of the Gilbert-Wade doctrine.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 691 (Powell, J., concurring) =Brennan's dissent= In a dissent joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall, Justice Brennan argued that Gilbert and Wade compelled a right to counsel during the pre-indictment lineup. Brennan focused on the reasoning of Wade, noting that a pre-indictment identification without counsel seriously compromised a defendant's ability to effectively defend himself. For the same reasons that a post-indictment lineup presented risks of suggestivity and unfairness, so too did a pre-indictment showup. A pre-indictment showup was also as difficult for a defendant to reconstruct at trial as a post-indictment lineup.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 691-700 (Brennan, J., dissenting) Brennan criticized the plurality's reliance on the abstract concept of the beginning of a criminal prosecution instead of examining the realities of the prejudice faced by an uncounseled criminal defendant. Brennan also rejected the idea that Stovall provided a different standard of protection - the events in Stovall occurred before Wade and Gilbert were decided, so Wade and Gilbert were simply not applied to the facts of Stovall retroactively.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 700-705 (Brennan, J., dissenting) =White's dissent= Justice White wrote a separate dissent, asserting that Wade and Gilbert controlled, and that the lower court should be reversed.Kirby, 406 U.S. at 705 See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 406 References External links * Category:United States Sixth Amendment appointment of counsel case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1972 in United States case law ","title":"Kirby v.

Some natural caves, halfway up the rock wall of the gorge formed by the stream of Leno Vallarsa were certainly used from 753 (the date inscribed on the rock) from a Monaco hermit.  History  According to legend, the hermit San Colombano first arrived there and killed the dragon that caused the death of children baptised in the waters of the river below Leno. More likely, the legend was born as a place from the first hermit monks from the nearby monastery of Bobbio, or the Priory of St. Columban Bardolino. Visitation to the site was prescribed during Lent. The first settlement was the \\"Grotta degli Eremiti,\\" or \\"Cave of the Hermits,\\" in an undefined time. The inscription dated 753, engraved on the rock next to the current tower, dates back, however, the continued practice of the monastic hermitage. Between the late tenth and early eleventh century, records indicate the first construction of a small church dedicated to the saint at the opening of the cave, under a roof of natural rock. The first documentary evidence of the presence of the hermitage and the church is from 1319, relating to a bequest made to the \\"Church of St. Columba\\" on the part of Count William of Castelbarco of the House of Lords of Lizzana and Rovereto, and the other, 1470, is still preserved in Lizzana, attesting to the faith of the inhabitants of the place with celebrations and processions to the Irish saint to avert the long drought. The hermitage or the \\"hermit's cave\\" was used by monks, hermits, who were its guardians, until 1782 when the practice of the hermitage was abolished. Since then the place of worship was later cared for by the inhabitants of the valley. The province of Trent in 1996 restored the church, and the opening to the public is maintained by a group of volunteers gathered in the Committee Friends of St. Columban. The hermitage is accessed by a staircase of 102 steps carved into rock. Frescoes depict the fight between St. Columba and a dragon (an allegory of the struggle between good and evil), as well as the representation of Paradise, located in the cave. Another fresco with \\"Madonna and Saints\\" is the fifteenth-century altar of the church and keeps recordings with prayers and candles dated between 1505 and 1782, witnessed the pilgrimage to the shrine.

History of Chicago, Volume 3, Chicago, IL: The A T Andreas Company Publishers, pg. 776, 1886. Bishop Thomas Foley appointed Rev. Michael Lyons to organize the new parish. Father Lyons purchased the J. McPherson Livery Stables at the northeast corner of Halsted and Egan (39th Street), which was at that time the southern border of the City of Chicago. The new parish was appropriately named \\"Nativity Church,\\" since Christ was also born in a stable. It was dedicated on Palm Sunday, April 5, 1868.Flaherty, Reverend James J. Souvenir Book, Golden Jubilee Mission Press, pg. 10, 1919. The parish grew and Rev. Jeremiah S. O'Neill was named to succeed Father Lyons. With the support of the parish, he acquired 15 lots at the corner of 37th and Dashiel (now Union Avenue) to construct the present church.O'Brien, Reverend Edward P. Nativity of Our Lord Centennial Celebration, Chicago, IL: Allied Press, pg. 39, 1979. In 1874, Reverend Joseph M. Cartan was named pastor and quickly set about the work of building a greater parish and improving the lives of those who lived in Bridgeport. Father Cartan laid the cornerstone for the current church in 1876. Construction continued at a slow and steady pace. It was not until almost three years later that the lower church hall was finished sufficiently to hold services. On December 5, 1885, over nine years after the cornerstone was laid, Archbishop Patrick Feehan dedicated Nativity of Our Lord Church. It was not until the following summer that decorating and final construction details were completed. The cost of the church was reported at $70,000.Ed. by Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D.

Architecture  The church was designed by Patrick Keely, who was a prolific designer contributing to over 600 churches in the United States. Other notable works by Keely include Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago, The Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame University and the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.  Stained glass  Nativity Chicago Main Entrance Stained Glass Stained glass insets Integral to the beauty and warmth of Nativity is the warm, muted light that bathes the interior of the church. Over 185 stained glass windows provide beauty and illumination. Every façade contains stained glass. The fact that the church is intimate and inviting in spite of its considerable mass is due in large part to the warmth these windows bring. Church records indicate that the current windows were installed in 1907 under the direction of then pastor Rev. James J. Flaherty.Ed. By Rev. Msgr. Harry C. Koenig, S.T.D. A History of the Parishes of Archdiocese of Chicago, Chicago, IL: The New World Publishing Company, pg. 657, 1981. The windows can be divided into three primary sets: the nave windows lining the east and west walls of the church, the three windows above the narthex and the windows above the three front entrances. There are dozens of additional windows in the sacristy, the bell tower, and throughout the church. The windows are constructed with gothic patterns that show art nouveau influences. Most major panels have a unique round inset that features a classic, Munich-style stained glass with a religious symbol. Through the generosity of many parishioners, these 168 heavenly and historic windows were restored to their original grandeur in 2010-2011, as the final phase of a five-year parish improvement process.

He was born in 1883 at Hampstead, London as the son of Edgar William Brinsmead and Annie Brinsmead. He migrated to Australia around 1903, where he settled down in North Queensland, later in Tonga. When the First World War started in 1914, he joined the First Australian Imperial Force. He served and fought on Gallipoli and at Pozières. Recovering in England after an injury in 1916 and after completing an officers course, he served in the Australian Flying Corps at its headquarters in London. The AFC headquarters was responsible for supervising the Australian Training Wing which was based in England. Brinsmead was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1919. After his return to Australia in 1920, Horace Brinsmead was appointed Australia's first Controller of Civil Aviation. On 8 December 1920, he married Ivy Ernestine McDonald, daughter of Charles McDonald. In 1931, while travelling to London to negotiate for the establishment of the first air mail route between England and Australia, his plane was destroyed on takeoff at Alor Setar in Malaysia. There were no casualties and Brinsmead suffered only minor injuries. Instead of waiting for a replacement airplane, he took a commercial flight. This airplane crashed on takeoff at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok on 7 December. Five others were killed, Brinsmead survived with bad injuries but was no longer able to work. He was brought back to Australia in February 1932, officially still holding his office. Acting Controller during the following year was his deputy Edgar Johnston, until he took office in 1933.see: Biography of Edgar Charles Johnston Brinsmead died in March 1934 in Melbourne, leaving one son and two daughters. Tributes * The Australian Airline Qantas named a Lockheed Constellations airplane after Brinsmead in 1951. * In his book about Australia Down Under in 2000, the writer Bill Bryson retold the history of Brinsmead, but mixing up his name as Harold C. Brinsmead. This confusion might in part be explained in that Brinsmead was entered into Cranleigh School under the first name 'Harold' so he may have been called both. Bryson mentioned it as ironic fact that Brinsmead undertook his last journey to show the reliability of aviation.Bill Bryson, Down Under.

Christian was the best in the game, and can be compared to Pelé who's a former soccer player and is maybe the best player to ever play, just like Mogens.

Members of this family played a significant part in the Norman conquest of England and subsequent power struggles in England, Wales and Ireland in the 11th to 14th centuries. Lands held The first English land-holding by the family was the feudal barony of Bramber in Sussex, granted by King William the Conqueror to William I de Braose (died 1093/1096) between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the Domesday Book of 1086 in which he is shown as the holder of Bramber. Philip I made personal conquests in the Welsh Marches of Radnor and Builth. A moiety of the feudal barony of Barnstaple was inherited by William II from his mother. William III acquired the feudal barony of Kington c.1194 and the lordship of Gower in 1203, and a moiety of the feudal barony of Totnes in 1206. King John temporarily seized most of the lands of William III in 1208 but his infant son King Henry III (1216–1272) regranted most, except Barnstaple which was lost permanently, to his 3rd son Reginald. Reginald's son William V died leaving 4 daughters co-heiresses to all the family's Welsh lands, but Bramber and Gower passed back to the senior family line which held them until 1326 when William VII died leaving two daughters co-heiresses.

This was a region where Canadian Gaelic – a dialect of Scottish Gaelic – was still the predominant language spoken by people in the area, but was quickly being replaced by English. Sensing that he would have only a time-limited opportunity to record this culture before its native speakers died off, he founded Cape Breton's Magazine in 1972, to record the culture and living history of the island and its people. Foxfire Magazine provided the inspiration for the magazine's design and layout, while Robert Frank influenced his photographic style.

It is a two-storeyed building constructed from local slate stone and has a great hall with a hammer-beam roof, installed in the late 15th century. The building was substantially altered in the early 18th century and remodelled after 1869. It was redeveloped for multiple occupancy in the 1980s and is now divided into about twelve apartments. It was the birthplace of the famous explorer and discoverer of the source of the River Nile, John Hanning Speke (1827–1864). History =Early= The earliest parts of the building to survive were built by a member of the Denys family. The hall, which is 30 ft x 20 ft and has 5-foot-thick walls, has been dated by the form of decoration around the doorways to the early to mid-14th century.Emery (2006), pp. 611–12 In 1416, a licence for a chapel at the house was granted by Bishop Stafford, and it has been speculated that the room over the porch was used for this.Rogers (1926), pp. 185–92. During the late 15th century the hall was remodelled and it is clear that some of the work was based on that already done at nearby Weare Giffard Hall; identical carving on the porches of both buildings shows that the same mason was employed for at least part of the work. The main improvement, though, was the construction of a fine four-bay hammerbeam roof to the main hall, again clearly influenced by, though somewhat less ornate than the one at Weare Giffard. The hammer-beams are supported on carved stone corbels representing figures, one of which holds a shield displaying the arms of the Denys family (three battleaxes). Sitting on the ends of the hammer- beams were a series of ten carved sitting heraldic beasts, each around two feet tall. A few alterations were made during the late 16th century, such as the addition of a staircase to the left of the porch, and the insertion of a large window into the hall to the right of the porch.Cherry & Pevsner (1989), pp. 613–4. The last male member of the Denys family of Orleigh was Anthony Dennis (died 1641), to whom a mural monument survives in the Orleigh Chapel in St Mary and St Benedict's Church, Buckland Brewer.Mural monument to Anthony Dennis (d.1641), his second wife, and his eleven children in Buckland Brewer church. When he died in 1641 he left three daughters as co-heiresses and they conveyed the property to trustees in 1661. In 1684 the trustees sold it to John I Davie (died 1710), a prominent tobacco merchant from Bideford. =Davie family= John I Davie died in 1710 and is commemorated by a large mural monument in the Orleigh Chapel of St Mary's Church, Buckland Brewer.Rogers (1938), pp.53–4.) his son and heir, Joseph Davie (died 1723), embarked on a series of improvements to the interior. These included, in the hall, the installation of an ornamental fireplace, and the addition of fire buckets decorated with the Davie arms and the date 1721 — they remained in place until the early 20th century. Other additions made at this time included a new inner hall accessed from newly created doors by the side of the fireplace, and rainwater heads on the east front of the building, which bear the Davie arms as well as those of Pryce, which refer to Joseph Davie's wife, Juliana Pryce, who died aged 28 in 1720. Joseph himself died in 1723, but the building stayed in the Davie family until 1807, when it was in the ownership of Joseph Davie Bassett, who built Watermouth Castle and moved there. In that year Orleigh Court was either sold, or according to local tradition, lost in a game of cards, to Major Edward Lee. =Lee, Speke and Rogers= After Edward Lee's death in 1819, the house passed to his nephew, the politician John Lee Lee (1802-1874), who did not live there but let it to his sister and her husband, William Speke. Born at Orleigh in 1827 was their son John Hanning Speke, the celebrated explorer who discovered the source of the River Nile. From 1845 the house was occupied by other tenants: Col. Bayly from 1845 to 1856, and Capt. Audley Mervyn-Archdale from 1856 to 1869. In 1869 Orleigh was sold to Thomas Rogers, who employed the architect J. H. Hakewill to make extensive changes to the house, including the replacement of most of the windows, including a new oriel window in the porch, complete reworking of the north range and the addition of a wood-panelled dining room. Hakewill also built two Mock Tudor lodges in the grounds. Orleigh was inherited by his son William Henry Rogers (born 1868), who made a few alterations to it, such as replacing some of the dry-rot infested panelling in the hall with 16th-century decorated panels which he had discovered in a loft over the stables, and which he surmised had been removed from the original dining room. William Henry Rogers was an antiquarian and he included a history of Orleigh Court in a booklet about Buckland Brewer, published in 1938. However, by 1939 he had sold the house, which was then converted into multiple occupation until after World War II when it was left empty and decaying. In 1952 it was made a listed building,Devon Buildings Group Newsletter No. 2. October 1986 but remained empty until 1982, when work began to convert it into apartments. In 1986 the owner attempted to sell by auction at Sotheby's the ten 15th-century wooden animal carvings that had decorated the hammer-beams, but their provenance was investigated and they were deemed to be fixtures of a listed building, so they were returned and the owner was prosecuted.Devon Buildings Group Newsletter No. 4. October 1987 As a result of this incident the listing status of the building was increased to Grade I. As of 2011, the building is divided into a number of apartments and is surrounded by eight acres of communal grounds.

Neverov was his pseudonym; his real last name was Skobelev. Biography Neverov was born on 20 December 1886 in the village of Novikovka Melekess, Samara Province. His father was a farmer, a former non-commissioned officer of the Life Guard Lancers who later withdrew from the village and served as a doorman in the city. Neverov spent his childhood, until the age of 16, living in the home of his grandfather. This was due mostly to his father's military service.Biographical Note by Neverov, from City of Bread, Hyperion Press, 1973. He received his earliest education at a local church school. In 1903 he was accepted at a secondary school in Ozerkino. He graduated after three years of study with a diploma which gave him the qualifications of an elementary school teacher. In his third year in Ozerkino he published his first story in The Temperance Messenger, a St Petersburg newspaper. After 1906, Neverov worked as a rural teacher, while at the same time publishing stories in magazines. He married in 1912. In 1915 he spent time as a nurse in Samara. During the Revolution he became friendly with members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, but in 1919 joined the Bolsheviks, and held significant positions in various institutions of Samara. He was one of the founders of the local folk theater, and in 1919 he wrote his first plays, one of which, \\"Baba\\", won first place in a contest in Moscow. During the famine years of 1920-1921, together with a mass of hungry people, he fled from the Volga Region into Tashkent. In the fall of 1921, after the death of one of his three children, he conceived a plan of moving to Moscow. He travelled first to Tashkent in order to obtain food for his family. This harrowing journey was the inspiration for his novel City of Bread. In spring of 1922 he moved to Moscow where he joined the group \\"The Forge\\". He affiliated himself with a number of revolutionary periodicals, wrote short stories, published his earlier stories in book form, and began work on a novel, Story of Women, which he never finished. Portrait of Neverov by Boris Kustodiev. Neverov died suddenly of heart failure on 24 December 1923 in Moscow. He was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery.

Talbi's article 'al- Raqīq', Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd edition. ar-Raqiq served as Secretary to two Zirid princesBadis ibn Mansur and Al-Muizz ibn Badis for over a quarter of a century and gained a reputation as a diplomat, poet and historian. He enjoyed wine, women and song, and in fact wrote treatises on each of those subjects. His work on the enjoyment of wine (Quṭb as-Surūr) is the only one of his prose works to survive in its entirety, but Yaqut has preserved some of his poems. The following is a few lines from one:translated from the French of M. Talbi (1970), who quotes from Yaqut And at the conventone may guess that 'convent' and 'virgin' in this poem in fact refer to the opposite. of al- Quṣayr, what nights have I passed not knowing Morning from evening, without ever waking from drunkenness! An innocent virgin presents me with nectar As soon as the bell chimes at dawn. Slender Christian beauty, at her slightest movement Her waist slays me, so slim in size! He wrote a history of North Africa (Tārīkh Ifriqiyya wal-Maghrib) which enjoyed a very high reputation, and was quoted from by later authors such as Ibn Idhari, Ibn Khaldun and Al- Nuwayri. This is fortunate, as the complete work is now lost. In 1965, a Tunisian scholar working in Morocco discovered a manuscript which he believed might be a small part of ar-Raqiq's Tarikh, dealing with the Umayyad conquest of North Africa. This was rushedTalbi (1971), who documented the process by which it was published, called it 'a race against the clock'; the editors of the later critical Arabic edition criticised it as a 'rough and ready edition ... we decided to ignore that edition'. into print by someone else who got hold of a photocopy and published it as definitely the work of ar-Raqiq. This has been the cause of controversy. Tunisian historian Mohamed Talbi stated that he believed it to be the work of a later anonymous compilator who used ar-Raqiq as well as later historians as a source. The work itself (unlike many contemporary histories) contains no indication of who wrote it, and is very fragmentary. According to Talbi (1971), the style does not display the refinement expected of someone like ar-Raqiq. There are also anachronisms.Talbi (1971) notes it contains the phrase 'sultan of the Romans' where near contemporary works use 'king of the Romans'. The title 'sultan' was not used in the Maghrib until the 13th century. Nevertheless, many modern historians quote the work as being of ar-Raqiq when forced to use it from lack of other sources. A further controversy erupted between Tunisian historians Talbi and H.R. Idris when the latter criticised Talbi's article on ar-Raqīq in the Encyclopaedia of Islam.Idris (1970) Apart from the authorship of the published fragment of the Tārīkh, Idris also took issue with the description of ar-Raqīq as having 'Shi'ite sympathies'. The argument raged over several papers in the journal Arabica in the early 1970s.Talbi (1970) points out that the Zirids and their court were in fact Shi'ite, Idris (1970) believed they were secretly Sunni Notes References * Idris, Hady Roger (1970).

It brought together White Russian émigrés and early German Nazis who aimed to overthrow the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union, replacing them with authoritarian régimes of the far right. The group was originally known as Die Bruecke (The Bridge).

It gave Hitler the idea of a vast Jewish conspiracy, involving a close alliance between international finance and Bolshevism and threatening disaster for mankind.Kellogg p278 Recent research on Hitler's early years in Vienna (1905-1913) appears to have shown that his antisemitism was at that time far less developed than it became under the new influences.Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship by Brigitte Hamann New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 347-359.

Course  It begins in the city of Magdeburg in Saxony-Anhalt at the Bundesstraße 71 (Magdeburg Ring). Just before the southern end of Magdeburg is the junction with the A 14 motorway. This is followed by the Langenweddingen ring road. This section was upgraded in the wake of the Langenweddingen train crash, in which 94 people were killed on 6 July 1967. South of Langenweddingen the B 81 crosses the B 246a, which runs from Wanzleben (West) to Schönebeck (Elbe) (Ost). In the area of the Egeln ring road the B 180 from Wanzleben joins B 81. As the ring road continues it crosses the River Bode. Following that the B 180 joins from Aschersleben. The B 81 continues along the Kroppenstedt ring road, built in 2007/2008, and crosses the Bode again as it bypasses the village of Gröningen. Shortly before Halberstadt it is crossed by the B 245 from Schwanebeck and Eilsleben, in Halberstadt it meets the B 79. The B 81 continues, linking the town of Halberstadt with the North Harz motorway, the B 6n, to the west. As a result, a similar autobahn-like expansion of this road section is one of the broader requirements listed in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan, BVWP). The B 81 crosses the B 6n at the Blankenburg- Zentrum junction. In Blankenburg it meets the B 27. The B 81 continues through the Harz Mountains. About 6 km beyond Blankenburg it passes through the small hamlet of Wendefurth. Below the Wendefurth Reservoir the B 81 crosses the Bode and continues on the Wendefurther Steige to the upper basin of the Wendefurth Power Station. After a further 7 km the road reaches the climatic spa of Hasselfelde, where it forms a junction with the B 242. Finally the B 81 crosses the state border between Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia reaching Netzkater in the borough of Ilfeld, where it ends at a crossroads with the B 4.  Upgrade situation  From its start in Magdeburg to the junction with the B 180 from Aschersleben the B 81 has been upgraded to four-lanes. Only a roughly 5.5 kilometre long section to Egeln is still two lanes. Currently this section is being upgraded to four. In the remaining stretch, the ring roads around Kroppenstedt and Gröningen have two lanes. The bypasses around Halberstadt and Blankenburg are a high priority in the current Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. Currently it is in the planning phase. The ring road around Hasselfelde is a further requirement.

He is widely regarded as an erudite Torah scholar in his own right. Biography Schiller was born in 1937 and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where he attended the high school division of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin He graduated from Yeshivas Ner Yisroel in Baltimore. The 1960s and 1970s were a time of searching for meaning by Western-educated, college-age men and women. In 1972, Rabbis Noah Weinberg, Mendel Weinbach, Nota Schiller, and Yaakov Rosenberg founded Shma Yisrael Yeshiva to teach young Jewish men with little or no background in Jewish studies. After a few years, Weinberg left the yeshiva over a difference in philosophy and founded Aish HaTorah in 1974. Shma Yisrael subsequently changed its name to Ohr Somayach, after the commentary on the Mishneh Torah written by Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk, the Ohr Somayach, in response to critics who contended that the name belonged to the entire Jewish people, not just one institution. Ohr Somayach International Schiller was the driving force behind the development of Ohr Somayach International, which has opened yeshivas and learning branches in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia.

His actions in the 1953 Battle of Pork Chop Hill were the subject of a 1959 movie, Pork Chop Hill.  Early life  Clemons's father was also Joseph G. Clemons. Clemons lived for a while and attended elementary school in Hillsborough County, Florida. Clemons graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute in 1945 and enlisted in the Army, serving for eighteen months before being appointed to West Point. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1951 (Cullum number 18024). During the Korean War, his residence was Arlington, Virginia.  Korean War  Clemons was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross while serving as a platoon leader in Company K, 31st Infantry Regiment for \\"heroism in action against the enemy in the vicinity of Kumhwa, Korea, October 28, 1952\\", a part of the Battle of Triangle Hill. In that action, Clemons led the attack platoon in a counterattack, leading multiple attacks with limited ammunition, including hand-to-hand fighting. On April 17, 1953, after being assigned as the commanding officer of Company K while still a first lieutenant, he led the counterattack on Pork Chop Hill. He was awarded the Silver Star for his part in this action. In his Silver Star citation, Clemons's \\"gallantry, personal example, and outstanding leadership\\" was cited as the major factor in taking and holding the position, commenting further that \\"rarely in combat history has a force of the size committed on Pork Chop taken such losses ... and nevertheless continued to hold their position\\". At one point during the battle, Clemons estimated that he had lost approximately half his force. During the battle Clemons was reinforced by G Company, 17th Infantry Regiment, commanded by his brother-in- law, Walter B. Russell Jr. Clemons and his command served as the centerpiece of a book by S.L.A. Marshall called Pork Chop Hill which was turned into a 1959 movie, Pork Chop Hill. In the movie, he was portrayed by Gregory Peck, and Clemons served as a technical adviser.  Later career  After the Korean War, Clemons was stationed at Fort Campbell as an officer in the 101st Airborne Division. Later in his service, he rose to the rank of Colonel and became the commander of 198th Infantry Brigade in 1969 during the Vietnam War. While commanding the 198th, he ordered that his personal helicopter be for medical resupply and evacuation missions. On a mission in 1970, he landed when one of his units was pinned down by intense enemy fire. Clemons ordered his pilot to pick up and evacuate the wounded while he remained on the ground; he was awarded the Bronze Star with V device for valor. He was awarded the Distinguished Graduate Award in 2007 by the West Point Association of Graduates. He was interviewed in 2013 concerning a book.  Personal life  In 1952, Clemons married Cecil B. Russell, daughter of Major Walter B. Russell. In late 1973, Clemons passed the State of Hawaii examination for real estate salesman or broker.

The war was fought on land and sea and involved both regular forces and civilian militia. Land and naval battles took place in the territories of Bahia, Cisplatina and Rio de Janeiro provinces, the vice-kingdom of Grão-Pará, and in Maranhão and Pernambuco, which today are part of Ceará, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte states. There is a shortage of reliable casualty data. Laurentino Gomes 1822 Nova Fronteira, Brasil 2010 Chapter 10 pg 163 Casualty estimates are based on contemporary reports of battles and historical data, and range between a total of 5,700 to 6,200.  Opposing forces  The population of Colonial Brazil at the turn of the 19th century was 3.4 million. 60% of them were free men, mostly of Portuguese descent. At that time slaves were not counted as free people. It is difficult to say how many Reinóis (those born in Portugal) lived in Brazil in 1822, since all inhabitants were subjects of Portugal. The majority of the population lived near the Atlantic ocean, mainly in the provinces of Pernambuco, Bahia and Minas Gerais. These three regions dominated economic and political life of the colony. The Pernambuco region thrived by producing sugar, a crop of great value at the time. The southern Bahia region produced sugar, cotton, tobacco and molasses. It was the most densely populated and richest region. Further south was Rio de Janeiro, which controlled the gold and diamond production of Minas Gerais. The Portuguese army in Brazil consisted of professional troops and militiamen. All officers were appointed by the Court of Lisbon. In 1817, a Republican revolt broke out in Pernambuco. As a result, 2,000 soldiers of \\"Auxiliary Division\\" were sent to Brazil. With the arrival of the troops, native officers in Brazil were not given many responsibilities. At the start of the war, there were about 10,000 Portuguese soldiers and units of the royal cavalry along the Atlantic coast. About 3,000 soldiers were later besieged in Montevideo. A similar number of soldiers occupied Salvador and the rest of the troops were scattered throughout Brazil.  Start of the war  During late 1821 and early 1822, the inhabitants of Brazil took sides in the political upheavals that took place in Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon. Fights between Portuguese soldiers and local militias broke out in the streets of the main cities in 1822 Laurentino Gomes; 1822 Nova Fronteira, Brasil 2010 Chapter 10 pg 161 and quickly spread inland, despite the arrival of reinforcements from Portugal. There was a split in the Luso-Brazilian Army which was garrisoned in the Cisplatina province (modern- day Uruguay). Portuguese regiments retreated to Montevideo and were surrounded by Brazilians, led by Baron of Laguna (himself a Portuguese, but, as many other aristocrats, on the side of Brazilian independence). Remote and sparsely populated northern provinces of Pará and Maranhão declared loyalty to Portugal. Pernambuco was in favor of independence, but in Bahia there was no consensus among the population. While Portuguese forces were able to stop the local militias in certain cities, including Salvador, Montevideo and São Luís, they failed to defeat the militias in most of the other cities and proved ineffective against the guerrilla forces in the rural areas of the country. Supporters of Brazilian Independence created and enlarged the Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Navy by forced enlistment of citizens, foreign immigrants and mercenaries. They enlisted Brazilian slaves into militias and also freed slaves in order to enlist them in the army and the navy. By 1823, the Brazilian Army had grown, replacing its early losses in terms of both personnel and supplies. The remaining Portuguese forces, already on the defensive, were rapidly running out of both manpower and supplies. Outnumbered across a vast territory, the Portuguese were forced to restrict their sphere of action to the provincial capitals along the shore that represented the country's strategic sea ports, including Belém, Montevideo, Salvador and São Luís do Maranhão.  Naval action  Both parties (Portuguese and Brazilian) saw the Portuguese warships spread across the country (mostly in poor condition) as the instrument through which military victory could be achieved. In early 1822, the Portuguese navy controlled a ship of the line, two frigates, four corvettes, two brigs, and four warships of other categories in Brazilian waters. Warships available immediately for the new Brazilian navy were numerous, but in disrepair. The hulls of several ships that were brought by the Royal Family and the Court to be abandoned in Brazil were rotten and therefore of little value. The Brazilian agent in London, Marquis of Batley (Philibert Marshal Brant) received orders to acquire warships fully equipped and manned on credit. No vendor, however, was willing to take the risks. Finally, there was an initial public offering, and the new Emperor personally signed for 350 of them, inspiring others to do the same. Thus, the new government was successful in raising funds to purchase a fleet. Arranging crews was another problem. A significant number of former officers and Portuguese sailors volunteered to serve the new nation, and swore loyalty to it. Their loyalty, however, was under suspicion. For this reason, British officers and men were recruited to fill out the ranks and end the dependence on the Portuguese. The Brazilian Navy was led by British officer Thomas Cochrane. The newly renovated navy experienced a number of early setbacks due to sabotage by Portuguese-born men in the naval crews. But by 1823 the navy had been reformed and the Portuguese members were replaced by native Brazilians, freed slaves, pardoned prisoners as well as more experienced British and American mercenaries. The navy succeeded in clearing the coast of the Portuguese presence and isolating the remaining Portuguese land troops. By the end of 1823, the Brazilian naval forces had pursued the remaining Portuguese ships across the Atlantic nearly as far as the shores of Portugal.

From 1822 to 1825 the Portuguese Government engaged in heavy diplomatic efforts to avoid the recognition of Brazil's independence by the European Powers, invoking the principles of the Congress of Vienna and subsequent European alliances. In 1824, in the wake of the adoption of the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil on March 25, the United States of America became the first nation to recognize the independence of Brazil. Since the coup d'etát on 3 June 1823 the Portuguese King John VI had already abolished the Constitution of 1822 and dissolved the Cortes, thus reversing the Liberal Revolution of 1820. Under British pressure, Portugal eventually agreed to recognize Brazil's independence in 1825, thus allowing the new country to establish diplomatic ties with other European powers. The first act of recognition was materialized in Letters Patent issued on May 13, 1825, by which the Portuguese King \\"voluntarily ceded and transferred the sovereignty\\" over Brazil to his son, the Brazilian Emperor, and thus recognized, as a result of this concession, Brazil as an \\"Independent Empire, separate from the Kingdoms of Portugal and Algarves\\". The second act of recognition was materialized in a Treaty of Peace signed in Rio de Janeiro on August 29, 1825, by means of which Portugal again recognized the independence of Brazil. This Treaty was ratified by the Emperor of Brazil on August 30, 1825, and by the King of Portugal on November 15, 1825, and entered into force in international Law also on November 15, 1825 upon the exchange of the instruments of ratification in Lisbon. The Portuguese, however, only agreed to sign the Independence treaty on condition that Brazil agreed to pay reparations for the properties of the Portuguese State that were seized by the new Brazilian State. Brazil desperately needed to establish normal diplomatic relations with Portugal, because other European Monarchies had already made clear that they would only recognize the Empire of Brazil after the establishment of normal relations between Brazil and Portugal. Thus, by a separate convention that was signed on the same occasion as the Treaty on the Recognition of Independence, Brazil agreed to pay Portugal two million pounds in damages. The British, who had mediated the Peace negotiations, granted Brazil a loan of the same value, so that Brazil could pay the agreed sum. In spite of the unpopular clauses, and especially of the harsh financial agreement, Brazilian Emperor Pedro I agreed to ratify the treaty negotiated with Portugal as he was keen on resolving the recognition of independence question before the opening of the first legislative session of the Brazilian Parliament (Assembléia Geral or General Assembly) elected under the Constitution adopted in 1824. The first meeting of the new Legislature was set to take place on 3 May 1826, and after a brief delay, that Parliament was indeed opened on 6 May 1826. By that time, the independence question was resolved, as the Independence treaty had been ratified in November 1825 and as the Emperor, still yielding the fullness of legislative authority (that he was to lose upon the first meeting of the Parliament), ordered the execution of the agreement as part of the law of Brazil on 10 April 1826. With the loss of its only territory in the Americas and a significant portion of its income, Portugal quickly turned its attention to increasing the commercial productivity of its various African possessions (mainly Angola and Mozambique).

Dapoxetine works by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, increasing serotonin's action at the post synaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay.Government, A. ( 2010). Australian Public Assessment Report for Dapoxetine (D. o. H. a. A. T. G. Administration, Trans.). As a member of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family, dapoxetine was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, dapoxetine is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast acting property makes it suitable for the treatment of PE but not as an antidepressant. Originally created by Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company, dapoxetine was sold to Johnson & Johnson in 2003 and submitted as a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PE in 2004. Dapoxetine is sold in several European and Asian countries, and in Mexico. In the US, dapoxetine has been in phase III development. In May 2012, USA-based Furiex Pharmaceuticals reached an agreement with ALZA Corp and Janssen Pharmaceutica to market dapoxetine in the USA, Japan and Canada, while selling the rights to market the drug in Europe, most of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East to Menarini. Medical uses =Premature ejaculation= Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of dapoxetine for the treatment of PE. Different dosage has different impacts on different types of PE. Dapoxetine 60 mg significantly improves the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) compared to that of dapoxetine 30 mg in men with lifelong PE, but there is no difference in men with acquired PE. Dapoxetine, given 1–3 hours before sexual episode, prolongs IELT and increases the sense of control and sexual satisfaction in men of 18 to 64 years of age with PE. Since PE is associated with personal distress and interrelationship difficulty, dapoxetine provides help for men with PE to overcome this condition. With no drug approved specifically for treatment for PE in the US and some other countries, other SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and citalopram have been used off-label to treat PE. Waldinger's meta-analysis shows that the use of these conventional antidepressants increases IELT two- to nine-fold above baseline, compared to three- to eight-fold when dapoxetine is used. However, these SSRIs may need to be taken daily in order to achieve meaningful efficacy, and their comparatively longer half-lives increase the risk of drug accumulation and a corresponding increase of adverse effects such as reduced libido. Dapoxetine, on the other hand, is generally categorized as a fast-acting SSRI. It is more rapidly absorbed and mostly eliminated from the body within a few hours. These pharmacokinetics are more favorable in that they might minimize drug accumulation in the body, habituation, and side effects. Contraindications Dapoxetine should not be used in men with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and in those receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, and telithromycin. Dapoxetine can also not be used in patients with heart failure, permanent pacemaker, or other significant ischemic heart disease. Caution is advised in men receiving thioridazine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressant. If a patient stops taking one of these drugs, he should wait for 14 days before taking dapoxetine. If a patient stops taking dapoxetine, he should wait for 7 days before receiving these drugs. Adverse effects The most common effects when taking dapoxetine are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, diarrhea, and insomnia. Discontinuation due to adverse effects is dose related. According to McMahon in recent study in Asia, the rate of discontinuation is 0.3%, 1.7%, and 5.3% of 1067 studied subjects with placebo, dapoxetine 30 mg, and dapoxetine 60 mg respectively. Unlike other SSRIs used to treat depression, which have been associated with high incidences of sexual dysfunction, dapoxetine is associated with low rates of sexual dysfunction. Taken as needed, dapoxetine has very mild adverse effects of decreased libido (<1%) and erectile dysfunction (<4%). =Overdose= No case of drug overdose has been reported during clinical trials. =Interactions=  With phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors)  Many men that have PE also suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED). Treatment for these patients should consider the drug–drug interaction between dapoxetine and PDE5 inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) or sildenafil (Viagra). In Dresser study (2006), plasma concentration of 24 subjects was obtained. Half of the sample pool were treated with dapoxetine 60 mg + tadalafil 20 mg; the other half were treated with dapoxetine 60 mg + sildenafil 100 mg. These plasma samples were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that dapoxetine does not alter the pharmacokinetic of tadalafil or sildenafil.  With ethanol  Ethanol doesn't affect the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine when taking concurrently. Mechanism of actions The mechanism through which dapoxetine affects premature ejaculation is still unclear. However, it is presumed that dapoxetine works by inhibiting serotonin transporter and subsequently increasing serotonin's action at pre and postsynaptic receptors Human ejaculation is regulated by various areas in the central nervous system (CNS). The ejaculatory pathway originates from spinal reflex at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral level of spinal cord activated by stimuli from male genital. These signals are relayed to the brain stem, which then is influenced by a number of nuclei in the brain such as medial preoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Clement's study performed on anaesthetized male rats showed that acute administration of dapoxetine inhibits ejaculatory expulsion reflex at supraspinal level by modulating activity of lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) neurons. These effects cause an increase in pudendal motoneuron reflex discharge (PMRD) latency. However, it is unclear whether dapoxetine acts directly on LPGi or on the descending pathway in which LPGi located. Pharmacokinetics ;Absorption Dapoxetine is a white powder substance and water- insoluble. Taken 1–3 hours before sexual activity, it is rapidly absorbed in the body. Its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached 1–2 hours after oral administration. The Cmax and AUC (Area Under the plasma vs. time Curve) are dose dependent. The Cmax and Tm (time needed to obtain the maximum plasma concentration) after single doses of dapoxetine 30 mg and 60 mg are 297 and 498 ng/mL at 1.01 and 1.27 hours respectively. A high fat meal does reduce the Cmax slightly, but it is insignificant. In fact, food doesn't alter dapoxetine pharmacokinetics. Dapoxetine can be taken with or without food. ;Distribution Dapoxetine is absorbed and distributed rapidly in the body. Greater than 99% of dapoxetine is bound to the plasma protein. The mean steady state volume is 162 L. Its initial half-life is 1.31 hours (30 mg dose) and 1.42 hours (60 mg dose,) and its terminal half life is 18.7 hours (30 mg dose) and 21.9 hours (60 mg dose).Dapoxetine: a guide to its use in premature ejaculation (D. T. Perspective, Trans.). (2011) (Vol. 27, pp. 1-4). ;Metabolism Dapoxetine is metabolized extensively in the liver and kidney by multiple enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and flavin monooxygenase 1 (FMO1). The major product at the end of the metabolic pathway is circulating dapoxetine N-oxide, which is a weak SSRI and contributes no clinical effect. The other products presented less than 3% in the plasma are desmethyldapoxetine and didesmethydapoxetine. Desmethyldapoxetine is approximately equipotent to dapoxetine. ;Excretion The metabolites of dapoxetine are eliminated rapidly in the urine with a terminal half-life of 18.7 and 21.9 hours for a single dose of 30 mg and 60 mg respectively. Safety and tolerability ;Cardiovascular safety The cardiovascular safety profile of dapoxetine has been studied extensively during the drug development. Phase I trials showed that dapoxetine had neither clinical significant electrocardiographic effects nor delayed repolarization effects, with dosing up to four-fold greater than the maximum recommended dosage which is 60 mg. Phase III studies in men with PE showed a safety and well tolerate profile of dapoxetine with dosing of 30 and 60 mg. There is no cardiovascular adverse had been found. ;Neurocognitive safety Studies of SSRIs in patients with major psychiatric disorders prove that SSRIs are potentially associated with certain neurocognitive adverse effects such as anxiety, akathisia, hypomania, changes in mood, or suicidal thought. However, there is no study on the effects of SSRIs in men with PE. McMahon's study in 2012 showed that dapoxetine has no effect on mood and is not associated with anxiety or suicidality. ;Withdrawal syndrome The incidence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome symptoms in men using dapoxetine to treat premature ejaculation has been described by reviewers as low or no different from the incidence of such symptoms in men withdrawn from placebo treatment. The lack of chronic serotonergic stimulation with on-demand dapoxetine minimizes the potentiation action of serotonin at synaptic cleft, thus decreasing the risk of DESS. Synthesis Synthesis of dapoxetine Currently very few methods are used to synthesize (S)-dapoxetine. This novel approach consists of only six steps in which three main steps are shown above. The initial reactant is trans-cinnamyl alcohol which is commercial available. Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and Mitsunobu reaction have been used to produce expected (S)-dapoxetine. The overall yield is 35%. This method is considered a good choice compare to the known methods due to high yield and easily obtainable reactants.Venkatesan, K., & Srinivasan, K. V. (2008). A stereoselective synthesis of (S)-dapoxetine starting from trans-cinnamyl alcohol. arkivoc, 16, 9. Regulatory history Dapoxetine was created by Eli Lilly and in phase I clinical trial as an antidepressant. However, it never worked out well as a medication for the treatment of depression and was shelved for a while before subsequently developed to treat PE. In December 2003, Eli Lilly sold patent of dapoxetine to Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) for 65 million US dollars in cash. Eli Lilly may also receive royalties payment from PPD if the sale exceeds certain amount. ALZA is the current owner of dapoxetine. However, PPD will receive milestone payment and drug royalties from ALZA. If approved, dapoxetine will be marketed in the US by Ortho McNeil pharmaceutical, Inc.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The church originated in the 12th century, and a small amount of fabric from that time is incorporated in its structure. The tower was built at an uncertain time before the 15th century. The building of the rest of the church took place during the 15th century and was completed in 1451. At this time the town was prosperous because of its wool and cloth trade. The town was badly damaged by Lancastrian forces during the War of the Roses in 1461, but St John's was apparently unharmed. The bellframe was rebuilt between about 1680 and 1710. The interior was re-fitted during the 18th century. In 1856 it was restored in the High church tradition by the local architect Edward Browning, who had also worked on other churches nearby. There were further restorations in 1867, in 1897–99 when Browning's painted decoration in the chancel was removed, and in 1903, when a vestry was added. In 1950–53 the north arcade was partly rebuilt, and the parapet of the tower was renewed. The work on the arcade was made necessary because of subsidence caused by the collapse of burial vaults beneath them. This work was carried out by E. Bowman and Sons. The church was declared redundant in 2003, and more repairs have been carried out since that time. Architecture =Exterior= St John's is constructed in limestone ashlar with lead roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory, a south porch, a chancel with north and south chapels, a south vestry, and a west tower which is incorporated in the west bay of the north aisle. The exterior is entirely Perpendicular in style. The tower is in five stages, and may have been altered in the 15th century to match the rest of the building. It has clasping buttresses, and an embattled parapet with tall pinnacles. The bell openings have two lights. The chancel, nave and aisles are also embattled, and all the windows date from the 15th century. The south porch is shallow and richly decorated. Its parapet again is embattled, with pinnacles and gargoyles. =Interior= Only a small amount of 12th-century fabric remains, most of the interior of the church and the fittings being from the 15th century. The roof of the nave is finely carved, including angels on the bosses. The font is octagonal, with a 17th-century cover which is embellished with a conical spire with crockets. There is a piscina in the chancel, and another in the south aisle. The pulpit dates from 1953, and was donated by the restorers of the church at that time. The benches in the nave and the choir stalls are by Browning. Between the east ends of the aisles and the chapels are screens dating from the 15th century. Some of the glass dates from 1451; this was cleaned and re-set in 1974. Other glass dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, and includes the east and west windows of 1856 by Francis Wilson Oliphant, and windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. The memorials include a brass dated 1489, and wall tablets from the 18th and early 19th centuries. The organ was built by Bevington in 1870, and a third manual was added two years later by Hill and Son. In 1974 it was restored by Hill, Norman and Beard. There is a ring of four bells. The oldest bell dates from 1550, two were cast in 1561 by Newcombe and Watts, and the fourth bell is dated 1814 and was cast by Robert Taylor.

Over fifty collieries were in operation at various times between the middle of the nineteenth century and the closure of the last pit in 1988. The coalfield extended across the southern part of Fife where rocks of the Coal Measures Group occur and was one of a series of coalfields throughout the Midland Valley from which coal was won by both deep workings and opencasting methods. It is traditionally divided into the West Fife, Central Fife and East Fife coalfields with Kirkcaldy having been a particularly important area. Some of the mines extended beyond Fife under the Firth of Forth following the seams which occupy the Leven Syncline which extends to the south shore of the firth at Musselburgh and beyond.ch17, Trewin, N.H. (ed) 2002 The Geology of Scotland, The Geological Society, London The Longannet power station near Kincardine used to source much of its coal from nearby pits but the Longannet coal mine closed after severe flooding in 2002, an event which more or less marked the end of deep mining in Fife and indeed Scotland. Opencasting in Fife was severely reduced after the premature closure of the power station. As of 2020, most opencasts have ceased production of coal, not only on a regional level but in Scotland as a whole.

The bridge links White County, Illinois with Posey County, Indiana and carried U.S. Route 460 from 1947 until 1974 when the highway was decommissioned in Illinois and Indiana. The four-span bridge is owned by the White County Bridge Commission and was built without federal funds in 1930 by the Big Wabash Bridge Company of Carmi, Illinois. The next bridge across the Wabash about 15 miles (24 km) downstream is the Wabash Memorial Bridge near Mount Vernon, Indiana and the next bridge upstream is for Interstate 64, which does not allow farm vehicles. Details As originally designed, the bridge is 2,579 feet (.49 of a mile) long. It has 47 spans and a 20 foot wide concrete roadway. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The bridge is the first highway bridge erected across the lower Wabash River and the oldest remaining bridge in use over the Wabash's length in Illinois and half of Indiana. The original owner was a private company, the Big Wabash Bridge Company of Carmi, Illinois, which was chartered by Congress to build and operate the bridge on May 1, 1928.Public Law 70-340, 45 Stat. 480, \\"Authorizing Roy Clippinger [et al.]...to construct, maintain, and operate a bridge across the Wabash River....\\" The company contracted with the Nashville Bridge Company of Nashville, Tennessee to build it. The bridge opened on December 21, 1930, and 10,000 people attended the dedication of the bridge on December 30, 1930. In 1941, Congress created the White County Bridge Commission as a joint Illinois-Indiana agency to purchase the bridge from the Big Wabash Bridge Company for $895,000.Borah v. White County Bridge Commission, 199 F.2d 213 (7th Cir. 1952). About 900 vehicles crossed the bridge each day. The bridge collected an average of $30,000 in monthly tolls and had $22,000 in monthly expenses. The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship to historic New Harmony, Indiana as well as the bridge's age. The three-member Commission was established by Congress on April 12, 1941,Public Law 77-37, 55 Stat. 140, \\"Act to Create the White County Bridge Commission,\\" but Congress repealed the statute providing for an appointment mechanism in 1998. The Commission's general manager, who is 75, speculated that the bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die. In 1951, the current toll booth on the western edge of the river was constructed by the Electronic Signal Company, to replace an earlier booth on the eastern edge. In 1952, a tollpayer sued to exercise his right to inspect the books and records of the Commission, but lost his lawsuit and was not allowed access. In 1955, the General Accounting Office issued a report critical of the Commission and claiming that one commissioner had a conflict of interest. In response, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a suit seeking removal of the Commissioner and recovery of the misapplied funds. However, the courts dismissed the case.United States v. White County Bridge Commission , 275 F.2d 529 (7th Cir. 1960). In 1994, the Commission contracted to apply an epoxy coating on the bridge's surface, but the coating delaminated and the Commission refused to pay the contractor claiming that the coating had not been applied correctly. After a trial, the Commission lost the lawsuit and paid. J.S. Sweet Co. v. White County Bridge Comm'n, 714 N.E.2d 219 (Ind.Ct.App.1999). See also J.S. Sweet Co. v. Sika Chemical Company , 400 F.3d 1028 (7th Cir. 2005). From September 2007 to April 2008, the bridge to closed to all traffic when cracks appeared in some of the concrete support piers. During the closure, contractors added new pilings to the existing piers and made other required repairs. In 2010, engineers determined that the bridge required an additional $6 million in repairs. The National Bridge Inventory rated the bridge \\"Structurally Deficient.\\" Closure Toll booth at Illinois end, June 2013, one year after permanent closure On May 21, 2012, it was announced that the bridge would close permanently at noon on May 29, 2012. White County Bridge Commission member Jim Clark stated, \\"the cost to make repairs was more than we could imagine.\\" However, Clark then made the decision to close the bridge immediately after receiving the complete report from a team of nine engineers who inspected the bridge on April 29. \\"I knew it was bad, but didn't know just how bad until I received their full report by email Monday morning,\\" Clark said. \\"Once I saw their weight-load calculations, I knew we had to shut it down right away. We couldn't wait until May 29.\\" The thirteen toll booth employees were laid off. As of the closure there are $49,015 in toll tickets that have not been used. Refunds were given for thirty days from the closure. The closure of the New Harmony Bridge as reported in the Evansville Courier would have a significant impact on farmers in the area and the oil industry. The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.

The combined list of his efforts as a director for documentaries, silent, and sound films includes over 90 film titles during his lifetime. Early life Born in Tokyo, Yamamoto attended Keio University, where he helped form a film appreciation society. He first appeared in film in 1921 as an actor opposite Yoshiko Okada, but that only earned the wrath of his family, who disowned him. Career He worked as an actor on the stage, joined Nikkatsu as an assistant director, and finally made his directorial debut in 1924 at Tōa Kinema. After working at Nikkatsu again, he was lured to Photo Chemical Laboratories (P. C. L.) in 1934, where he first made a name filming the comedies of Kenichi Enomoto. When P. C. L. became the Toho company, Yamamoto helmed realist dramas such as Tsuzurikata kyōshitsu and Uma (starring Hideko Takamine), and war films such as Hawai Mare oki kaisen. After World War II, he continued directing films, but increasingly worked in television and radio. Legacy He is now mostly known as the mentor of Akira Kurosawa, who served as his assistant director on 17 films. He is also responsible for the career of Toshiro Mifune. In 1947, one of Mifune's friends who worked for the Photography Department of Toho Productions suggested Mifune try out for the Photography Department. He was accepted for a position as an assistant cameraman. At this time, a large number of Toho actors, after a prolonged strike, had left to form their own company, Shin Toho. Toho then organized a \\"new faces\\" contest to find new talent. Mifune's friends submitted an application and photo, without his knowledge. He was accepted, along with 48 others (out of roughly 4000 applicants), and allowed to take a screen test for Kajiro Yamamoto. Instructed to mime anger, he drew from his wartime experiences. Yamamoto took a liking to Mifune, recommending him to director Senkichi Taniguchi. Selected filmography Advertisement for Enoken no Kondō Isami.

Roe earned the nickname \\"Robinhood\\" because of his philanthropy among the neighborhood poor.\\\\- Time Magazine- Mon. Aug. 18, 1952\\\\- \\"Chicago gangster gunned down\\" - Jet Magazine - Aug. 21, 1952 After refusing to pay \\"street tax\\" to the Chicago Outfit, Roe fatally shot a made man who had been ordered to assassinate him. In retaliation, Roe was murdered by an Outfit crew commanded by Sam Giancana on August 4, 1952. Early life and career Theodore L. Roe was born in Galliano, Louisiana to an African American sharecropper, and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas.\\\\- \\"One brave man's stand against the mob\\" - American Mafia.com - July 2011 As a child, he received no formal education, and when he was of age, he did odd jobs for a tailor and learned how to sew. Some time after that, he got involved in bootlegging and gained a notorious reputation as a colorful racketeer who could pass for white. His career as a bootlegger ended after a few years and he moved to Detroit, where he worked in an automobile plant. When he was 31 years old, he took what he learned working for the tailor in Arkansas, and moved from Detroit to Chicago and began working for an African American tailor named Edward P. Jones. Shortly after Roe began working for Jones, Jones decided to get involved in policy and he made Roe his first \\"runner\\", or salesman of lottery chances. Under the protection of politicians Edward Joseph Kelly and Patrick Nash, the Kelly-Nash Machine, Jones was making $2000 a day by 1930. By 1938 he had increased his earnings to $10,000 per day and Roe was pulling down nice cuts from the profits. They soon caught the attention of Al Capone and his syndicate, and they set out to take over the numbers racket in Chicago. The Jones-Roe wheels were netting over $25 million annually, by 1946 and the mob, seeking to move in on the Jones brothers and Roe, kidnapped Ed Jones and held him for a ransom that included $100,000 and a promise to relinquish his policy business. Ted Roe paid the $100,000 ransom but after Jones was released, he decided not to give up his share of the business. However, the Jones brothers fled to Mexico, leaving the entire business to Ted. The Caifano killing and trial Chicago Outfit capo, Sam Giancana, who was attempting to take over the Southside gambling operations, ordered an attempt to kidnap Ted Roe. On June 19, 1951, Ted ended up killing one of the kidnappers, Fat Lenny Caifano, who was not only a made man, but also the brother of capo Marshall Joseph Caifano. The Chicago Police Department arrested Roe and charged him with murder. The following day, Chicago Police Detectives Ed Landis and Richard Barrett transported Roe to a court appearance. According to Detective Barrett's son, DEA agent Rick Barrett, \\"My Dad said the people of the neighborhood loved Roe. He was like a Robin Hood to them. Dad always said Roe was 'respected' because he refused to give in to the Italians, the Outfit. You know how they say, 'a crook with honor'? I guess that describes Roe. He was not a loudmouthed flambuoyant jerk and definitely not a murdering thug like the drug lords who took over that same neighborhood years later.\\"Chepesiuk, Black Gangsters of Chicago, page 92. To prevent the Outfit from murdering him, Roe was placed under heavy guard at the Cook County Jail. To prevent poisoning, Roe's meals were specially prepared outside prison walls. On June 25, 1951, Roe was further charged with conspiracy to violate the Illinois State anti-gambling statute.Ron Chepesiuk, Black Gangsters of Chicago, pages 91-93. Roe pleaded self-defense and his defense team was also able to link prosecutors to the mob causing key evidence against Roe to be thrown out. Roe eventually beat the case, but not before being denied bail six times before and during the trial proceedings.\\\\- \\"Policy Kings\\" - Ted Roe - Tues. Aug. 4, 2009\\\\- Time Magazine- Mon. Aug. 18, 1952 Upon beating the case, Roe thumped his chest and exclaimed to reporters, \\"They'll have to kill me to take me.\\"Chepesiuk, page 92. Roe's \\"Robin Hood\\" effect In their heyday, policy kings were the black community's banks and employers in Chicago. In the early part of the 20th century, segregation and economic discrimination had a devastating effect on African American communities throughout the United States, and in Chicago and some of the other major cities in the north, the policy industry generated a lot of money to poor black neighborhoods. Policy kings put a lot of their earnings into legitimate businesses such as car dealerships and churches. Aside from running a smooth operation, Ted Roe is remembered for paying hospital bills for newborns, and funeral tabs for the deceased. On one occasion, an elderly woman who had hit the number with one of the shady gangster wheels in town, came to Roe to complain that the gang had not paid her her money for the hit. Ted and some of his boys went over to the men and persuaded them to give her her winnings. He has also been known to walk the streets of poor black neighborhoods passing out fifty dollar bills to needy people.\\\\- Chicago Sun Times - \\"Bronzeville's policy kings were early venture capitalists\\" - July 7, 2003 - Curtis Lawrence Personal life Theodore L. Roe lived in Chicago with wife Carrie until his death. He also had several relatives who lived in Dermott, Arkansas in Chicot County including a brother and a sister.\\\\- \\"Chicago gangster gunned down\\" - Jet Magazine - Aug. 21, 1952 Death After Fat Lenny's murder, Sam Giancana masterminded a month-long shakedown campaign against the Black bookmakers of Chicago. Dozens were shot at or blackjacked and others simply fled the city forever. Meanwhile, Theodore Roe was holed up in his mansion on South Michigan Avenue. On August 1, 1947, Roe was told by doctors that he had stomach cancer but that it was operable. On August 4, 1952, he dressed in a three-piece suit and hat and creeped down South Michigan Avenue. At around 10:00 p.m., as he was unlocking his car on the street outside his apartment, a voice called, \\"Roe!\\" He turned and was cut down by several shotgun blasts. He died slumped against a tree which still stands outside his former apartment at 5239 S. Michigan Ave. Theodore Roe was laid out in a $3,500-$5,000 casket and received the biggest funeral of any Chicago African American since Jack Johnson in 1946. Thousands lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Roe's 81-car funeral procession. At Roe's funeral, Minister Clarence H. Cobb said: \\"He was a friend of man, and he had a pure heart.\\" The Outfit seized control of his policy wheels, and many felt that Theodore Roe had pushed his luck too far. That is, until his widow revealed a secret. Lucky Ted had terminal cancer, and had been given only months to live.\\\\- Special Internet Broadcast:The Assassination of Ted Roe\\\\- American Mafia.com:The Legend of Teddy Roe Over an FBI wiretap during the early 1970s, Giancana said of Roe, \\"I'll say this.

Whilst this latter stone bears legible writing, there is none visible on Maen Llia though some faint lettering was reported still to be visible in the mid twentieth century. Legend has it that the stone goes down to the river, the Afon Llia to drink on occasion.

It is located west-northwest of Alpena, Michigan. Overview The Alpena CRTC is a year-round training facility. It provides premier support, facilities, instruction and airspace to Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Coalition and emergency responders to meet the mission requirements of combatant commanders and civil authorities. It is one of four Combat Readiness Training Centers in the United States. (The others are at Volk Field in Wisconsin; Gulfport, Mississippi; and Savannah, Georgia.) The Alpena CRTC boasts the largest airspace east of the Mississippi River, has 147,000 acres available for ground maneuver units, and trains over 20,000 joint and coalition personnel annually. The Alpena CRTC is the second organization in the Air National Guard to be certified as a Joint National Training Center. The base has three JTE's, offers JTAC Training, and operates a JTAC 4m dome simulator. History Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC), formerly named Phelps Collins Field and the Phelps Collins Air National Guard Base, has a long interesting history beginning in the early 20th century.Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson. A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization, 1946 – 1980. Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Before that date, the area had a reputation for yielding blueberries in abundance to local Indians and early settlers in the area. In the early 20th century, the area was known as the \\"Seven Mile Plains\\" named because the flat open area stretching from the Seven Mile Dam to M-32. During the early part of the 20th century, flying machines began to appear in the sky over most of the country including the Alpena area. It didn't take long for the early aeronautical risk takers to realize the flat open area was just what they needed to land and take off with their aircraft known as Jennies. The landing area was a bit rough going, but so was the practice of flying in general during those early years. Around the same time, local developers and land owners realized the potential of the flat area and foresaw the need for a landing strip as a result of the onset of air travel. Thus the idea of an airport was born. Harry Fletcher and his brother Philip (Nephews of Alan M. Fletcher, founder of Fletcher Paper Co.) began negotiations along with Robert Scott (then president of Scott Engineering) and James McQuarrie, who later sat on the County Board's Airport Committee. These individuals were fundamental in developing the plan and getting the state on board. The tract of 80 acres, previously surveyed by the Army Corps of Engineers, was donated by Harry and Phillip. Several other 40 acres plots donated by Alpena Power Company set the proposed plan into action. During that same time, Works Progress Administration (WPA) crews were working on projects around the country. They were pressed into service to begin the clearing of the underbrush and leveling out the land in preparation for the first landing area, which would later become the main part of the runway now in existence. Phelps Collins, while with the French Escadrille 103, in front of Spad XII at Beauzée-sur-Aire, France On 31 August 1931, the airport was formally dedicated as Captain Phelps Collins Field in honor of Alpena's World War I hero, who in May 1917 volunteered to the French Air Service and fought with the celebrated French Escadrille 103. On January 7, 1918, he transferred to the famed American 103d Aero Squadron, a successor to Lafayette Escadrille, and died while defending the airspace over Paris on 12 March 1918. Governor Wilber M. Brucker flew in to formally accept the Airport and it became Michigan's first State owned airport. Phelps had spent a lot of time in Alpena as a youth shortly before he became interested in flying. There is a monument in France honoring the escadrille and his name appears on it. Construction of the first hangar, a 40x90 foot structure built of cobblestone, began in 1935 and was completed in 1937. It could accommodate four average size aircraft of the era. The 1st Pursuit Group out of Selfridge Field practiced flying maneuvers and gunnery training near Oscoda, Michigan. When they became aware of the facility at Alpena, they were eager to try it out. By the late 1930s, they began to use the airfield, housing their personnel in tents at the Alpena County Fairgrounds. This marked the beginning of military personnel using the site for training maneuvers as they still do today. In 1940, 400–500 Selfridge men trained at Phelps Collins with a complement of 35 Seversky P-35's. With World War II looming on the horizon the training tempo increased. The next year they brought P-40 Warhawks and the first P-38's Lockheed Lightning fighters. =World War II= As a result of World War II, the demand for training facilities became crucial and so the field was taken over by the War Assets Administration. The rough landing strip was replaced by a military airfield, with construction beginning on 29 July 1942. When completed, Alpena Army Airfield consisted of three hard-surfaced concrete runways (5000x150 (01/19), 5030x150 (70/250), and 5030x150 (16/34). Improvements included: housing for 2,000 personnel, two mess halls, operation buildings, a hospital and three runways over a mile long and 150 feet wide. Actual construction began in 1942. This was a big project for Alpena. By this time the total acreage of the base had increased to 2,500 acres. It was activated on 19 April 1943. The planned use of the base, along with training military personnel, was to provide air defense for the Soo Locks. Controlled by the 4250th Army Air Force Base Unit. the airfield was initially assigned to Air Transport Command as a training base for long range transport pilots. In addition, the base was also tasked with certifying and training a pool of new pilots resulting from the P-47 Thunderbolt modifications for staging out aircraft to overseas bases. It operated two sub-bases, one being Kinross Army Airfield, which later became the Strategic Air Command Kincheloe Air Force Base and Raco Army Airfield, which later became an Air Defense Command CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile site during the Cold War. It was transferred to Air Technical Service Command in late 1944 when the ATC training program was wound down. Designated as Alpena Army Air Base, the facility was a maintenance and overhaul facility for B-24 Liberator bombers produced by Ford at its Willow Run, Michigan aircraft manufacturing plant. Aircraft would be sent to Alpena for modifications prior to their deployment to overseas combat units. =Postwar era= In 1946, Alpena Army Air Base was declared surplus and turned over to the War Assets Administration for disposition. It became Alpena County Regional Airport. Many of the buildings constructed in 1942 were stripped down and auctioned off and the only buildings left standing were the hospital area and big hangar built in 1943. Some of the barracks (which were very small) were sold off and moved. Some were placed in neighborhoods on Alpena's North side and were converted into private residences. =Air Defense Command= 100px Alpena Air Force Station (ADC ID: M-105) was established in 1954 by the United States Air Force Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. Exercising a right of return to the facility, ADC constructed the radar station on the northwest corner of the airport on the grounds of the former Army Air Base ground station. This site became operational in December 1954 when the 677th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to the new station from Willow Run Air Force Station, Michigan. Beneficial occupancy was achieved at this Phase I mobile radar site in late 1954. Operations began in 1956, with an AN/TPS-1D radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes.Winkler, David F. (1997). Searching the skies: the legacy of the United States Cold War defense radar program. Prepared for United States Air Force Headquarters Air Combat Command. Budget cuts forced the station to close in 1957. It was then replaced by an unmanned gap-filler radar site, designated P-34E with an AN/FPS-18 radar, located on the southwest side of the airport. It was operated as such by the 752d Radar Squadron at Empire AFS, Michigan from June 1960 until June 1968. Today, a few buildings remain of the ADC Radar Station, and the FPS-18 support building remains of the Gap Filler site. =Air National Guard use= The Alpena CRTC boasts a multitude of fire fighter training aids including our Aircraft Fire Training Simulator. The aircraft mock-up is used to train fire fighters in actual hands-on, live fire in aircraft emergencies. Using environmentally friendly Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) in a liquid and vapor state, fire fighters can practice extracting occupants from aircraft. The Grayling Air Gunnery Range provides over 147,000 acres of joint use ground maneuver and impact range space. A C-17 Globemaster III taxi's during Crisis Look 2004, an exercise at the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center here 16 October. The aircraft is assigned to the 62nd Airlift Wing at McChord Air Force Base, Washington By January 1952, plans were in place to have joint use with the civilian airport. The facility would be instated as an ANG Permanent Field Training Site (PFTS). Once the ANG took over the site, they completed another round of construction projects totaling $2.5M dollars. Sixty-two concrete block buildings were built including two dining facilities and barracks to house 2,000 men. The North/South runway was extended to 8,000 feet. Most of the day-to-day operations were performed by the Alpena County Road Commission still occupying a few building on the base. During the 1960s, the runway taxiways were extended and an air traffic control tower was added. Also during that decade, the Air Defense Command Detachment from Wurtsmith AFB, Oscoda Michigan, had 60 persons permanently stationed here in Alpena until 1972/73 at which time their unit was discontinued. The original military personnel assigned in 1953 totaled seven individuals and an additional two military and two Federal Civil Service personnel were added the following year. The next major personnel change was in 1979 when the military personnel had their status changed from Federal Civil Service Technicians to Active Guard Reservists (AGR). About that time the civilians employed on the base became Michigan State Civil Servants. In early 1960s, the Grayling Air- to-Ground Gunnery Range Negotiations began and early during the decade the range was constructed on 1,900 acres near Grayling, Michigan. Soon after, aircraft could be seen using the site to fly sorties for aircraft gunnery and bombing exercises. This added asset increased the usage and value of the base immensely. Units from all over the United States come annually to train, with Air National Guardsman totaling in the tens of thousands. In 1991, the site was renamed the Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC). This new title was more in line with the base mission of \\"combat training\\". With the closing of Wurtsmith AFB in 1993, the need for radar approach and control was assigned to the CRTC. Equipment and personnel to operate it were added to the facility. The mission of the CRTC was increased with the additional tasking of running an ANG Medical Readiness Training School. The schoolhouse was designed to train ANG medical units for field operations. Both of these programs added personnel to the workforce and the number of employees, military and civilian, was over 100 persons. Construction in the early 1990s was ongoing, with a major emphasis on upgrading the 1950s barracks and latrines to current standards. Thus a $3.8 million dormitory upgrade project begun and office buildings and officer quarters were all remodeled. During the period, under the command of Col Thomas G. Cuter, the base created a long range plan including a new dining facility, fire station, operations facility, squadron operations (office) buildings, a convention center, a new facility at the Grayling Range and new dormitories. In 1991, another tasking was added to the mission when the Air Combat Maneuver Instrumentation (ACMI) was instated. This system involves computerized communication between the aircraft and a computer satellite, providing full mission replay. With the addition of the Fire Training Site and MOUT City in early 2000, the CRTC hosts several Fireman Schools and numerous law enforcement training courses annually. Although the CRTC's core mission is to train ANG units, other military train here regularly. Air Force, Army, Navy Seals Marines and Latvian and Italian military have trained at the site. In recent years the CRTC has opened its gate to numerous non-profit organizations. It is not uncommon to see canine training, emergency response training along with other training maneuvers running all at the same time. Youth programs have expanded from the traditional Civil Air Patrol Cadets to include ROTC, JRROTC, Boy Scouts of America/Girl Scouts of the USA, Freedom Academy Students, Michigan Youth Camp Cadets. With the addition of 26 Traditional Guardsman positions in 2000, the number of total base personnel now is over 200 employees. AGRs, Traditional Guardsman, Michigan State Civil Service and contracted employees make up the group. Military members come from all over the United States as well as local residents. Prior to their assignment at the base, many personnel have served the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines. Personnel have been called to give aid for local area flooding and deployed to Hurricane Katrina relief mission. Many have volunteered and been deployed overseas in support of operations: Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Iraqi Freedom, Joint Forge, Jump Start, Enduring Freedom, Northern Watch, Northern Eagle and Deep Freeze. In 2013 manpower reductions took place with the closing of the Medical Readiness Training Site (MRTS). This closing was part of a reduction in manpower directed by the USAF and ANG. The closing of the MRTS constituted a loss of 14 enlisted and two officers. The Alpena CRTC also faced manpower reductions in 2013. The vehicle maintenance shop has faced manpower reductions. The Alpena CRTC Supply has been reduced to two members. The total loss of manpower in 2013 was over 25 enlisted members.

There are several proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon. One mechanism suggests that toxins build up in the pooled blood, and problems arise when this toxin-rich, oxygen-poor blood returns to the body when the patient is allowed to lie down. Another mechanism suggests that the sudden increase in preload causes acute heart failure. Although often discussed in lay publications on suspension trauma, several studies systematically reviewing the medical literature have concluded that there is no evidence of this phenomenon. Treatment In the past, preventing a patient from lying down following suspension trauma or any other situation where blood had pooled in the legs for an extended period of time was thought to be important; instead, it was recommended that a patient should be placed in a seated position so that the blood could gradually return to the body. However, recent medical guidelines have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend deviating from standard first aid procedures in which an unconscious or hypotensive patient is placed in a supine position. Instead, treatment should consist of removing a patient from suspension and providing basic trauma care, starting with airway management (which could theoretically be impeded by requiring a patient to be kept in a seated position).

The hill is culturally significant because it is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of Confucius. It is also the site of a historical temple dedicated to Kong He (alias Shuliang He), the father of Confucius, a Confucian academy (), and the Yusheng Memorial Temple (). According to the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, Confucius's parents-to-be, Kong He and Yan Zheng, went to pray at Mount Ni and Yan Zheng gave birth to Confucius afterwards.Ann-ping Chin: \\"The Authentic Confucius: A Life of Thought and Politics\\", Simon and Schuster, 2007, pg. 25 The existence of the Temple of Kong He can be traced back to the times of the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535 CE). However, the temple was abandoned and restored repeatedly during the Later Tang, Later Zhou, Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties. A major reconstruction was undertaken during the Ming dynasty (in 1417 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor). Further expansion of the temple followed during the Qing dynasty. As a result, most of the extant structures of the temple date from either the Ming or the Qing era. The current architectural complex contains three sets of buildings, the Kong He Temple, the Confucian Academy, and the Yusheng Memorial Temple. The Kong He Temple consists of the following halls: the Dacheng Hall (literally \\"Hall of Great Achievement\\") dedicated to Confucius, a \\"Sleeping Palace\\" dedicated to his wife Qiguan, the Hall of Qi Shengwang and the Sleeping Palace of Qi Shengwang. The Yusheng Memorial Temple is dedicated to mountain spirit of Mount Ni. The Confucian academy contains a lecture hall as well as rooms that were used by the temple management staff. Other structures in the academy include the Erdai and Sandai Halls, the Liang Wu, the Lingxing Gate (), the Shen Bao, the Tudi Temple (dedicated to the local Earth Deity), and the Guan Chuan Pavilion. The entire complex on Mount Ni is walled in. Outside the eastern enclosure wall lies the Confucius Cave (). According to the legend, Confucius was abandoned in this cave after birth by his mother because of his ugliness. The baby was then taken care of by a tiger and an eagle, which convinced his mother to take him back.Jun Jing: \\"The Temple of Memories: History, Power, and Morality in a Chinese Village\\", Stanford University Press, 1998 References Category:Qufu Category:Confucianism Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shandong ","title":"Mount Ni"},{"id":"30487981","text":"The Siege of Pest (modern city of Budapest, Hungary) occurred in 1542, when Ferdinand of Austria attempted to recover the cities of Buda and Pest in 1542 from the Ottoman Empire.E.J.

Jackson (1861 - 1940) was an American architect who designed many buildings for Roman Catholic clients in the Eastern United States, especially Connecticut. Early life and education Jackson was born 1861 in Waterbury, Connecticut and studied in the public schools of the city. After High school he studied for one year at St. Francis College, Brooklyn, New York. Having decided to make architecture his profession, he worked first with Albert M. West, and afterward with Robert W. Hill (1881–1887). Thereafter, he started his own firm with offices in Waterbury. Architectural practice At first Jackson worked on a large number of public buildings, including the Bank Street and Clay Street schools, the convents of Notre Dame and St. Mary, St. Patrick's hall, the new High school, the Judd building, and the Bohl building, all in Waterbury, CT. Around 1900 when he moved from Waterbury to New Haven, he decided to concentrate primarily on the design of churches and related buildings, mostly for catholic clients. In an advertisement from the 1921 edition of The Catholic Quarterly Review, he describes his practice as “Church Architect,” that specialized in “churches, convents, schools and ecclesiastical work. Plans and Consultations on all matters pertaining to Church Designing and Construction.” He maintained a satellite office at 184 Livingstone Street, New Haven, Connecticut, as well as his main office in the Townsend Building, 1123 Broadway New York City.

Personal life  Fernandes Coutinho was the son of Gonçalo Vasques Coutinho, Lord of Couto de Leomil, the 2nd Marshal of the Kingdom. His brother was Álvaro Gonçalves Coutinho, nicknamed Magriço, a semi-legendary knight of the Twelve of England. Fernandes Coutinho inherited his father's titles and position as Marshal in 1413. He participated in the Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415. He was one of the leaders of the Portuguese expedition to capture Tangier in 1437, serving directly under Prince Henry the Navigator. Although it proved a disaster, Coutinho served with distinction and was said to be the last man to leave the beach, personally covering the retreat and embarkation of the last Portuguese troops. After the death of King Edward of Portugal in 1438, Fernandes Coutinho was one of the ringleaders of the noble party, and conspired with Afonso of Barcelos to keep the dowager-queen Eleanor of Aragon as regent for the young King Afonso V of Portugal. They sidelined the popular candidate, prince Peter of Coimbra. Peter's brother, Henry the Navigator, eventually managed to detach Coutinho from Barcelos's side. In 1441 (or 1440), hoping to win the noblemen's allegiance, regent Peter of Coimbra invested Fernandes Coutinho as the first Count of Marialva. However, relations between the two remained tense. At the Battle of Alfarrobeira in May 1449, Fernandes Coutinho took the field on behalf of Afonso V against Peter of Coimbra. He died a year later. Marriage and Children In 1412, Fernandes Coutinho married D. Maria de Sousa (d. 1472), the natural daughter of Lopo Dias de Sousa, master of the Order of Christ. Their eldest son D. Gonçalo Coutinho succeeded as the 2nd Count of Marialva, the younger son D. Fernando Coutinho as the 4th Marshal of Portugal.

LGBT music spans the entire spectrum of popular music. Lyricism and song content typically express the frustration, anxiety, and hope associated with non-normative sexual and gender identities, offering marginalized groups a vital platform for expression. Recently, popular music has \\"provided an arena where marginalized voices can be heard and sexual identities shaped, challenged, and renegotiated.\\" Mainstream music has begun to reflect acceptance of LGBT and queer musicianship. Some queer icons are openly queer identifying and have made impactful changes in the world for LGBT people. Others such as Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Cheryl, and Britney Spears are straight allies that have expressed their support for the community.  Origin of the term  The origin of the genre arose during the 1980s when post-disco dance and house music, Hi- NRG, and freestyle music became more prevalent in the United States and LGBT artists gained prominence for exploring popular music trends. DJ Larry Levan started his DJ career at the gay disco Paradise Garage.  History  In the 1890s, New Orleans began testing different prostitution policies which led to brothels and gay musicians like Tony Jackson or Bessie Smith. Jazz was born from many homosexual artists. As it flourished, blues performers like Lucille Bogan and Ma Rainey began singing about their sexual adventures with other women. Soon after jazz took off, Broadway shows and musical audiences began to take shape as well. Despite progress in LGBT tolerance and acceptance, musicians still remain marginalized in popular music. American composer Leonard Bernstein had many homosexual relations, often with other musicians and composers, despite being in a heterosexual marriage. Many artists like Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, Dimitri Mitropoulos were subject to hiding their sexual identities from the public. American pianist Liberace was famously closeted and vehemently denied allegations of homosexuality until his death in 1987, suing a Daily Mirror columnist for insinuating his sexuality. While the entertainment industry now more openly discusses the role of gender identity both in the press and within music compositions, there is still reticence for many in the business to advocate for LGBTQ+ acceptance. Notwithstanding currents of intolerance in the United States, Broadway continues to provide a platform for gender and sexual minorities, culminating to the production of lauded musicals like Kinky Boots, Hair and The Color Purple.  LGBT artists  While popular music has always included LGBT artists, the increasing social tolerance of the late 20th and early 21st centuries allowed such artists to come out publicly. Early examples of this arose with the sexual liberation movement, with artists such as Elton John, Village People, Sylvester, Tom Robinson, Jill Sobule, Indigo Girls, k.d. lang, Freddie Mercury, David Bowie, Little Richard, Esquerita, Melissa Etheridge, Janis Ian, The B-52's, Cher, Kylie Minogue, Grace Jones, Lou Reed, and Marc Almond, among others. Many openly LGBT musicians have become successful, such as Elton John, who has the best-selling single in Billboard of the 1990s (\\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\"), and Will Young, whose single \\"Anything is Possible\\"/\\"Evergreen\\" was the best-selling single of the decade in the 2000s. Country singer Ty Herndon came out as gay in 2014, after three number one hits on Billboard Hot Country Songs. = 1970s = In the 1970s, the disco, glam rock and industrial music cultures offered a multitude of platforms for expression for gender and sexual non-conforming individuals. = 1980s = The 1980s saw increased exposure to LGBT culture, namely genderbending and cross- dressing, in the music industry with artists such as Culture Club, George Michael, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Pet Shop Boys, Dead or Alive, and Erasure. Music videos began to allude to LGBT relationships, including Bronski Beat's video for \\"Smalltown Boy\\", The Pet Shop Boy's \\"Domino Dancing\\", and Madonna's \\"Vogue\\". Gay icons during this decade included Cyndi Lauper, Loleatta Holloway, Gloria Gaynor, Bob Mould, Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford. = 1990s = An increase in pro-LGBT laws and artists condemning homophobia in their music populated much of the 1990s. Groups such as Placebo, Alcazar, Right Said Fred, Mana and more joined the ranks of allies and LGBT musicians. Bands such as Pansy Division and Tribe 8 led the queercore offshoot of hardcore punk that helped solidify LGBT arts in the decade.Robby Reverb, member of gay punk band mOral SeX recorded rock and country music as well, including \\"Accept It\\", written by gay poet Drew Blood. = 2000s and onward = The 2000s saw LGBT music branch off into its own genre, and new artists like Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Will Young, The Scissor Sisters, The Gossip, RuPaul, Mika, Dario, Adam Lambert, Harry Styles , Lauren Jauregui, Sakima, Dawnstar, Years & Years, Neon Trees, Miley Cyrus, and Troye Sivan supported a growing industry, spreading the message of equality and positivity. Country singer Chely Wright faced death threats and declining record sales after coming out in 2010. She made Wish Me Away, a documentary about her experience and it won several major awards in 2012 including trophies from the Los Angeles Film Festival, the Seattle LGBT Festival and the Tallgrass Film Festival. In 2012, Against Me! singer and guitarist came out as a trans woman and changed her name to Laura Jane Grace. Openly gay artists such as Tegan and Sara gained popularity; the duo produced a pro-tolerance advert jingle for Oreo in 2014. Some popular LGBT artists and bands today are 2020k, thraeyce, Girl in Red, Dodie, Otep, Kehlani, Hayley Kiyoko, Panic! At The Disco, King Princess, Pabllo Vittar, Mary Lambert, Halsey, MUNA, Kevin Abstract (Brockhampton), Sam Smith, Le1f, Azealia Banks, Baby Tap, Lauren Jauregui, Sia, Miley Cyrus, Electrosexual, Perfume Genius, Courtney Barnett, Troye Sivan, Clairo, Calum Scott, Greyson Chance, Kim Petras, Angel Haze, Hurray for the Riff Raff, Against Me!, SOPHIE, Rostam, Tom Goss, Shura, Superfruit, Years and Years, PVRIS, Jess Young , Seeva, Ddendyl Hoyt, Harry Styles, Frank Ocean, ILoveMakonnen, Janelle Monáe, Billy Gilman, Syd, Ladyhawke and Mykki Blanco. Prominent electronic music artist and synthesist for the band LCD Soundsystem, Rayna Russom came out publicly as a transgender woman in July 2017.  LGBT oriented music  One of the earliest US top 40 singles to feature a positive depiction of the LGBT community was bisexual rocker Lou Reed's 1972 song \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\", which detailed the lives of gay, bi, and trans members of Andy Warhol's social circle. http://www.openculture.com/2017/12/meet-the-characters-immortalized-in-lou- reeds-walk-on-the-wild-side.html Tyler the Creator and Frank Ocean at Coachella in 2012 In the past, music videos had been used as a way to depict LGBT relationships, even when the lyrics of the music didn't explicitly discuss them, as in Madonna's music video for her song \\"Vogue\\". They have since been used to express artists' sexuality. In 2016, FLETCHER's music video for her song \\"Wasted Youth\\" presents herself with a female love interest. In April 2018, Janelle Monáe came out as pansexual with her album Dirty Computer, and released the song \\"Make Me Feel\\"; the music video detailing a woman's attraction to two club goers. LGBT relationships have also been depicted in the music videos of straight musicians, further solidifying their positions as queer allies. Carly Rae Jepsen's music video for \\"Call Me Maybe\\" features gay male characters. The lyrics of songs have also been used by LGBT artists as a tool to express their identification. Frank Ocean's 2012 album Channel Orange has romantic songs that use male pronouns when describing his love interest. Hayley Kiyoko, nicknamed \\"Lesbian Jesus\\" by her fans, made her sexual orientation clear to the public with the release of her 2015 song \\"Girls Like Girls\\". In 2017, YouTuber and singer-songwriter Dodie Clark released her song \\"I'm Bisexual - A Coming Out Song\\" to announce to her fan base that she was bi. Straight and cisgender allies have also produced LGBT-oriented music. Country artist Phil Vassar released the song \\"Bobbi with an I\\" in 2009, which uses a humorous narrative to encourage acceptance of transgender individuals. Singer-songwriter Hozier released the song \\"Take Me to Church\\", whose music video partially focused on religion-based homophobia. \\"1-800-273-8255\\", a song performed by Logic and Alessia Cara, dealt with homophobia and the pain that it results in. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis teamed up with Mary Lambert to make \\"Same Love\\", a song about same sex marriage that focused on the message that love conquers all. The music video for Avicii's single \\"Silhouettes\\" depicts a person undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Some straight artists have been criticized by LGBT artists for their depiction of LGBT relationships. Katy Perry's 2008 song \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" and Rita Ora's 2018 song \\"Girls\\" both explore female same-sex relationships, but have been accused of being \\"tone- deaf\\" to the needs of the LGBT community. Lady Gaga's 2011 song \\"Born This Way\\" has been called a gay anthem for its message of self-love. Singer and actor Christian Chavez used his song \\"Libertad\\" to make a stance for gay rights and sexual freedom. Troye Sivan's music has been highly acclaimed for its authentic feel of gay millennial music experimenting with chill pop and activism such as \\"HEAVEN\\", \\"Bloom\\", and \\"My My My!\\". Jess Young (singer)'s bring her Pansexuality into her music. Her debut single Champagne & Caviar is all about that. The second verse was originally written \\"the only fire's in her darkness, the way it flickers when she goes down on me\\", and now it's \\"he\\" because her girlfriend at the time liked to be referred to in the male- pronoun, and had been dating a guy when she re- recorded.https://www.curvemag.com/eu-home/introducing-irish-lgbtq-artist-jess- young/  OUTMusic Awards  Since 2001, the American OUTMusic Awards program has functioned as an annual LGBT awards ceremony that mirrors the Grammys.

It is located west-northwest of Battle Creek, Michigan. It was closed in 1969. History =Cold War era= Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment Air Defense Commands permanent radar network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction of what became the network of Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) sites. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. The SAGE site that would become Custer Air Force Station was carved out of the eastern side of the Army's Fort Custer Training Center near Battle Creek, Michigan. The site was officially established on 18 April 1953. However, the 781st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) began operations with AN/FPS-3 and AN/CPS-4 radars at the site in April 1952. Initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The site was renamed Custer Air Force Station on 1 July 1956. An AN/FPS-4 replaced the AN/CPS-4 in 1956 and an AN/FPS-6 superseded this unit two years later. Also in 1958 an AN/FPS-20 replaced the AN/FPS-3 search radar. This radar was upgraded to an AN/FPS-66 in 1961. A second height-finder radar was installed in 1959. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-67. In 1958, the SAGE Data Center (DC-06) was established at Custer AFS (Fort Custer). DC-06 was co- located on the Cantonment area of the 781st AC&W; Sq. During September, 1959, the 781st AC&W; Sq joined the SAGE system, feeding data to DC-06. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 781st Radar Squadron (SAGE) (Radar Sq) on 1 September 1959. The squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In addition to the main facility, Custer AFS operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Midland, MI (P-67A/P-20G) * Richland Center, IN (P-67B/P-73J) * Saugatuck, MI (P-67C/Z-34G) * Shelby, MI (P-67D/Z-34H) The 781st Radar Sq was inactivated on 25 June 1965 and the sector was discontinued on 1 April 1966. The Gap Filler radars at Saugatuck and Shelby, MI were transferred to the 752nd Radar Squadron, Empire, MI on 27 January 1965, at which time they acquired ID's Z-34G and Z-34H, respectively. Midland, MI was transferred to the 661st Radar Squadron, Selfridge AFB, near Mount Clemens, MI on 4 February 1965, and Richland Center, IN was transferred to the 664th Radar Squadron, Bellefontaine AFA, OH on 15 February 1965. DC-06 was initially under the Detroit Air Defense Sector (DeADS), originally established as the 4627th Air Defense Wing on 8 January 1957. The DeADS was replaced by the 34th Air Division (AD). DC-06 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 34th AD until it was inactivated on 30 September 1969 when technology advances allowed the Air Force to shut down many SAGE Data Centers. With the inactivation of the Air Division, Custer AFS was closed effective 31 Dec 1969. =Current status= Today the site is a business & industrial park. The large SAGE DC-06 blockhouse remains, now being a secure storage facility operated by Iron Mountain Storage. The blockhouse stores paper archives, but still retains the original elevator and large map display with rolling ladder on a secret floor. The buildings in the immediate area of the SAGE blockhouse are in generally good repair, with some still in use. The Battle Creek regional chapters of the Air Force Sergeant's Association and Air Force Enlisted Association use the old Open Mess building.

He produced eleven poetry collections, four novels and a renowned biography of Thomas Merton. Life and career Mott was born in London in December 1930. His father was a solicitor and his mother was a sculptor from Denver, Colorado. Mott was educated in the United States and in England. After his service in the British Army, he attended Oriel College, Oxford, then art school and a year traveling in Europe and the Middle East. Mott then began his literary career taking a job in 1956 as the editor of trade journal, Air Freight. Between 1956-1966, Mott also worked as the assistant editor of the literary magazine: ADAM International Review, alongside editor Miron Grindea. In 1957, his first collection of poetry, The Cost of Living, was published. On 6 May 1961, Mott married Margaret Watt, a fashion designer, at St. John's Wood Church, London. In 1962, as the couple welcomed twin daughters, Mott's first novel The Notebooks of Susan Berry was published. Reviewer Kenneth Allsop writing for the Daily Mail called the book, \\"a brilliant first novel.\\" Between 1961 and 1964, Mott worked as a book editor at Thames & Hudson and then as an editor at The Geographical Magazine (1964–66). During this time, his first juvenile novel, Master Entrick was published in 1964 in the UK. The book was released in 1966 in the U.S. and a full twenty years later in 1986, a second edition was released as a Dell Yearling edition. In 1966, Mott was invited to teach at Kenyon College and to be the poetry editor of The Kenyon Review. While at Kenyon, Mott continued to publish poetry and fiction, publishing Helmet and Wasps and The Blind Cross. During the 1970s Mott and his family lived in Atlanta, Georgia. Mott taught at Emory University as Writer in Residence. Both Michael and Margaret, a costume designer with The Alliance Children's Theater and weaver, were active in Atlanta's budding arts scene. In 1972, he cofounded the Callanwolde Readings Program, which highlights poets and writers, with poet Turner Cassity. In 1974, Mott received the Governors Award in Fine Arts from then Governor Jimmy Carter. In 1978, Michael Mott was commissioned to write the authorized biography of Thomas Merton. The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton was published in 1984. The biography remained on the non-fiction The New York Times best-seller list for nine weeks. The book has had nine printings with 60,000 copies sold to date. Winner of a number of awards, the biography was the runner up for the Pulitzer Prize in biography in 1985. Mott was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1979. In 1978-1979, and again in 1985-1986 Mott was Writer-in-Residence at the College of William and Mary. He held a Christopher Award and other awards, and had an honorary doctorate from St. Mary's College, Notre Dame. Mott's wife Margaret died of cancer in 1990. In 1992, Mott married Emma Lou Powers, he retired, Professor Emeritus, after eleven years' teaching at Bowling Green State University. In retirement he lived and wrote in Williamsburg, Virginia.

It covers an area of . At one point it reaches within 38 m of the sea surface. It is protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) because of the diverse fauna developed in its bedrock reef habitat. It was discovered in 1962 and named by Smith and others in 1965. Geology The Haig Fras outcrop consists mainly of granite, forming a WSW-ENE trending elongate intrusion. The granite outcrop is surrounded by an area of Devonian-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks. Evidence from gravity data suggests that the extent of the intrusion is greater than the observed outcrop, based on its association with a linear negative gravity anomaly. It is dated at 277 Ma, Early Permian in age, within the range of intrusion ages for the granites that make up the Cornubian batholith. Although the two intrusions have the same trend and are of similar age, they are not thought to be related. In detail, three separate outcrops have been identified using a combination of radiometric data and seabed sampling. The granite is fine to medium-grained, unlike the megacrystic granite typical of the Cornubian batholith intrusions, although this may be due to the low level of sampling available. A foliated granite is locally developed as a marginal facies. The granite is thought to be cut by a swarm of basic dykes inferred from magnetic and seismic reflection data. This swarm is interpreted to be 56 km long and 2.5 km across and at least six separate intrusive bodies have been identified. The proposed intrusions are though most likely to be of Mesozoic age. Fauna Devonshire cup corals are found at the top of the reef. The bedrock reef at Haig Fras supports a range of fauna. Jewel anemones (Corynactis viridis) and Devonshire cup corals (Caryophyllia smithii) are found at the top of the outcrop. Encrusting sponges, crinoids and Ross coral Pentapora fascialis are found near base of the outcrop. Mobile fauna observed include urchins such as Echinus esculentus, brittle stars and the squat lobster Munida. Special area of conservation The area of the proposed SAC is , which includes a margin of around the mapped bedrock area, derived from the maximum water depth of and an assumed length to depth ratio of a fishing warp (the cable used to tow the fishing gear) of 3:1. This is intended to protect the site from potential further damage from demersal fishing. The area was first proposed in 2004 and was included in the first tranche of candidate SACs submitted to the European Commission in August 2008. It was selected on the basis of being an Annex I habitat, 1170 (reefs), in the terms of the EU Habitats Directive.

Khoury was born in 1945, into a Palestinian-Christian family, in the al-Sheikh Jarrah section of Jerusalem to his father, who was a judge, and his mother, a teacher. The Khoury family fled to Lebanon during 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A year later, they returned to what had become the new State of Israel. The family took up residence in the port city of Acre, near Haifa. Educated there and in the nearby village of Kufr Yasif, Khoury finished high school in 1963. He then entered the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but later dropped out and pursued a career as an actor. Khoury trained in Israel and from 1970 to 1973 he studied for three years at the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London, England. He later became involved with the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv and the Haifa Municipal Theater, continuing as a member of the latter for twenty years. Makram has recently returned to Haifa following a year-long tour playing Tierno Bokar in Peter Brook's 11 and 12.  Family  His eldest daughter, Clara Khoury, is a rising actress in Israel, having recently appeared in three films that garnered international attention: Rana’s Wedding (2002), The Syrian Bride (she played the daughter of the character played by Makram) (2004) and Lipstikka (2011).

The dotted line shows the area of negative gravity anomalies associated with these batholiths due to their relatively low density compared to average continental crust. The lines represents the 20 mGal Bouguer anomaly. The Cornubian batholith is a large mass of granite rock, formed about 280 million years ago, which lies beneath much of the south-western peninsula of Great Britain. The main exposed masses of granite are seen at Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, St Austell, Carnmenellis, Land's End and the Isles of Scilly. The intrusion is associated with significant quantities of minerals particularly cassiterite, an ore of tin which has been mined since about 2000 BC. Other minerals include china clay and ores of copper, lead, zinc and tungsten. It takes its name from Cornubia, the Medieval Latin name for Cornwall. Extent and geometry Bouguer gravity anomaly map over southwest England showing the linear negative anomalies associated with the Cornubian batholith and the Haig Fras granite A batholith is a large mass of intrusive rock formed from the crystallization of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface (magma). From gravity and magnetic geophysical data, the batholith is interpreted to extend from about 8°W, more than 100 km southwest of the Isles of Scilly, to the eastern edge of Dartmoor. The negative gravity anomaly, caused by the relatively low density of the granites compared to average continental crust, is linear and trends WSW-ENE, parallel with that associated with the Haig Fras granite. The shape of the batholith and the relationship between the individual plutons and the main mass of the granite remained entirely speculative until gravity data began to be used to constrain the thickness and shape of the batholith by modelling. The initial work by Martin Bott suggested that the batholith had an overall trapezoidal shape with a base to the batholith at about 10-12 km. However, current understanding of granite pluton shape suggest that most are either laccolithic or lopolithic. Comparisons with other examples would suggest that the thicknesses of the individual plutons would be in the range 3-5 km, based on their outcrop widths. The volume of the batholith was estimated in 1989 to be around 68,000 cubic kilometres.Selwood et al., p. 120 Formation Hound Tor on Dartmoor showing horizontal and vertical joints in the granite The Cornubian batholith formed during the Early Permian period, from about 300 to 275 Ma (million years ago) at a late stage in the mountain-building event known as the Variscan orogeny as a suite of late orogenic granites. It has been suggested that stretching of the Earth's crust (crustal extension) allowed the granitic magmas to move to higher levels in the crust. Evidence from neodymium and strontium isotopes suggests that the magmas that formed the batholith were mainly the result of partial melting of the lower crust with a minor component of basaltic magma from a mantle source. This lower crustal source is likely to have consisted of both metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, of Proterozoic age (2500 million to 542 million years old). As the molten rock cooled to around 1000 Celsius it solidified and crystallised and fractures along vertical joints formed. Over time the slate and sandstone rocks covering the granite were eroded exposing the granite in areas such as Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor. The granite also expanded and horizontal joints were formed. These joints are most clearly seen on exposed pieces of rock such as the Tors of Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor. As the granite erodes further, blocks of eroded granite known as clitter are left. =Timing= An approximate age of emplacement for the Cornubian batholith was known before radiometric dating methods became commonplace, from the observed relationships with the sedimentary rocks – both those which formed before the intrusion and those which were laid down after it. The youngest rocks into which the granites intrude are the Carboniferous Crackington and Bealsmill formations of Namurian to lower Westphalian age. This provides a lower bound for the timing of granite emplacement of about 310 Ma. The earliest instance of granitic clasts (fragments of the granite which have weathered away and become part of a new sedimentary rock) in younger sedimentary sequences is from the Late Permian St. Cyres beds. This gives an upper bound of about 250 Ma. The inferred age of emplacement from this evidence of Late Carboniferous to Early Permian has been confirmed by radiometric dating, although it has shown that the individual intrusions were emplaced over a significant time interval. The earliest dated major intrusion is the Carnmenellis pluton at 293.1±3 Ma. The youngest dated granite is the southern lobe of the Land's End pluton, intruded at 274.5±1.4 Ma. The earliest recorded magmatic activity is the intrusion of the small Hemerdon pluton on the southwestern flank of the Dartmoor pluton at 298.3±2.3 Ma. There is no apparent systematic variation in age of plutons compared to their position within the batholith. This suggests that the batholith grew by the coalescence of a series of separate intrusions over a period of about 25 Ma. =Mechanism of emplacement= As with all large intrusive bodies, the method by which the batholith's plutons were emplaced is a matter of debate, due to the space problem of adding such large masses to the upper crust. Four main mechanisms have been proposed; stoping, diapirism, extensional faulting and uplift of the overlying country rock over a laccolithic sill with a relatively small vertical dyke feeder. Evidence for a stoping mechanism has been described locally from the margin of the Tregonning intrusion, where a series of intrusive sheets extend out from the roof zone of the intrusion into the country-rock. Although the Land's End pluton was once thought to have a diapiric origin, its emplacement is now interpreted to have been accommodated by fault movements during regional extension. Plutons Granite at Haytor on Dartmoor Granite at Rough Tor on Bodmin Moor Granite outcrop at Land's End Granite at Trenemene, part of the Western Rocks, Isles of Scilly The individual plutons that comprise the Cornubian Batholith can be broadly subdivided into five main lithologies: Two mica, Muscovite, Biotite, Tourmaline and Topaz granites, each named for their distinguishing mineral(s). The two-mica and muscovite granites are older, and can be found in the Carnmenellis, Bodmin and Isles of Scilly, whereas the younger biotite and tourmaline granites are found within the Land's End, St. Austell and Dartmoor plutons. Topaz granites outcrop within the Tregonning, Land's End and St Austell plutons. =Dartmoor= This is the largest exposed area of granite which also forms the easternmost development of the batholith. The granite consists of two main types, coarse-grained granite with abundant large alkali feldspar megacrysts and coarse-grained granite with few megacrysts. To the southwest there is an area of coarse-grained granite with small megacrysts and several small exposures of fine-grained granite, particularly in the southeastern part of the outcrop. Interpretation of the gravity field over this pluton suggests that it is sheet-like with a thickness of nearly 10 km, and a root at its southern end extending down to about 17 km depth, which may represent the conduit that carried the magma to shallow crustal levels. It appears to have been intruded along the interface between Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. Uranium-lead dating of Monazite from this intrusion gives emplacement ages of 278.2±0.8 Ma and 280.4±1.2 Ma. =Bodmin Moor= The Bodmin Moor pluton consists mainly of coarse-grained granite with abundant small megacrysts. Towards the centre and the western margin of the outcrop there are smaller bodies of fine-grained granite. Gravity data suggest that this pluton is in the form of a south-southeastward thickening wedge, reaching a maximum of about 7 km. Monazite from this pluton gives an emplacement age of 291.4±0.8 Ma. =St Austell= The St Austell pluton consists of coarse- grained megacrystic granite with large megacrysts at the western and eastern ends of the outcrop. The central part of the pluton is also coarse-grained but lacks the megacrysts. Between the central megacryst poor and the large megacryst rich coarse-grained granites at the western end, a medium-grained granite is developed with lithium-mica. Smaller bodies of fine-grained granite are found in the central part of the outcrop and at the western end. Gravity data indicate that this pluton is wedge-shaped similar to that at Bodmin. Monazite gives an emplacement age of 281.8±0.4 Ma for this pluton. =Carnmenellis= The Carnmenellis pluton and the smaller intrusion of Carn Brea appear to be part of a single intrusive body. The central part of the Carnmenellis outcrop is a medium-grained granite with few megacrysts. The bulk of the main outcrop and the Carn Brea and Carn Marth masses consist of coarse- grained megacrystic granite with small megacrysts. Small bodies of fine- grained granite are found towards the west of the Carnemellis outcrop. The shape of this pluton is interpreted to be a sheet about 3 km thick with a near central root extending down to about 7 km depth. Boreholes at Rosemanowes that extend to over 2.5 km deep have shown very little variation in the petrographic composition of the granite with depth in this pluton.Selwood et al., p. 121 Monazite gives an emplacement age of 293.7±0.6 Ma for this pluton. = Tregonning-Godolphin = The Tregonning Granite and Godolphin Granite are two distinct granite bodies on the southern coast of Cornwall. The Tregonning Granite is mainly a medium-grained lithium-mica granite with a body of fine- grained granite developed towards the northwest of the outcrop. It has a unique chemistry and differs from the granite found within the Carnmenellis and Land's End granites, likely forming in a different manner. The Godolphin Granite is mineralogically and chemically similar to the nearby Carnmenellis Granite, although is finer grained. = Land's End = The Land's End pluton is mainly a coarse-grained granite with abundant large megacrysts. There is an area in the centre which is poor in megacrysts and there are several small and medium-sized masses of fine-grained granite throughout the outcrop. Dating has been carried out on xenotime and monazite samples, from a fine-grained granite and the main coarse-grained granite respectively. These give emplacement ages of 279.3±0.4 Ma for the fine-grained granite and 274.8±0.5 Ma for the main phase granite. This difference is consistent with fine-grained granite being a roof-pendant to the coarse-grained main phase granite intrusion. =Isles of Scilly= Looking across Tresco, the second-largest of the Scilly Isles The Isles of Scilly all have granite bedrock. The dominant rock type is a megacrystic biotite granite, although the megacrysts are relatively small. In the centre of the pluton a medium-grained granite is developed with few megacrysts, more tourmaline and less biotite than the main variety. Monazite from this pluton suggest an emplacement age of 290.3±0.6 Ma. =Haig Fras= This submarine outcrop, 45 km in length, lies 95 km northwest of the Scilly Isles, rising at one point to 38 m below sea level. In contrast to most granites of the Cornubian batholith the granites here are fine to medium- grained and generally lack megacrysts. It was intruded at 277 Ma and is considered most likely to be a separate but related intrusive body that runs parallel to the Cornubian batholith. =Other intrusions= Minor granitic intrusions are present throughout the peninsula. In some cases granitic bodies have been recognised from the mineralization above them, even if the intrusion itself has not been encountered. A series of minor intrusions are found within the country rock and the granites themselves. Common types are pegmatites, aplites and elvans.

Coarse-grained granite with large alkali feldspar megacrysts, Dartmoor (photo by Ian Stimpson) Luxullianite, a tourmalinized granite The main rock forming the batholith is granite, which formed when magma cooled slowly, covered by 2–3,000 metres of slate and sandstone. The slow cooling gave time for crystals to form in the granite which are large enough to see with the naked eye, giving it a granular appearance. These grains are mainly of quartz, feldspar and biotite. The granite is generally coarse grained and in some places very coarse-grained, or pegmatitic (grains larger than 3 cm). Large phenocrysts, several centimetres long, of K-feldspar, are a distinctive feature. The chemistry and mineralogy of the granites vary from one location to another, but they are all classified on the Chappell & White classification as being S-type, which means that they are ultimately derived from sedimentary rock protolith. Mineralogy The Cornubian intrusions are mostly made up of two-mica granite (containing both muscovite and biotite). Li-mica granite forms a less common type found only in the St. Austell pluton and some smaller intrusions. Many of the granites contain large alkali feldspar phenocrysts. In some locations the original granite has been modified to form a tourmaline-bearing granite called luxullianite. This tourmalinisation occurred during the late stages of cooling of the granite, as feldspar and mica were partly replaced by tourmaline. Chemistry The two-mica granites are strongly peraluminous – they have a high ratio of aluminium oxide to sodium and potassium oxides. They also have a low ratio of sodium to potassium and overall high level of alkalis. The granites are highly enriched in lithium, boron, caesium and uranium and moderately so in fluorine, gallium, germanium, rubidium, tin, tantalum, tungsten and thallium. Given the overall chemistry, the levels of phosphorus are also high. Strontium, barium and the elements from scandium to zinc are relatively depleted. This chemistry is consistent with partial melting of a source consisting of greywackes (a variety of sandstone). The conditions under which the melts formed is modelled to be temperature of 770 °C and a confining pressure of 50 MPa. Differences in chemistry have been identified between an earlier group of plutons (Isles of Scilly, Carnmenellis & Bodmin Moor) and a later group (Land's End, St Austell & Dartmoor). The early group of granites contain more aluminium than the later set and have steeper slopes on plots of cerium against yttrium. The later group contain more common basic microgranite xenoliths. The granites are generally rich in ammonium compared to average granites worldwide. There is also considerable variation between the individual plutons, with an average of 11 ppm for Dartmoor compared to 94 ppm for Bodmin Moor. The concentration of ammonium in these granites correlates well with both their initial / ratios and their peraluminosity. The relatively high ammonium content is interpreted to indicate that the granites were derived from a sedimentary protolith, or have been contaminated from such a source after emplacement to high crustal levels. =Associated metamorphic and metasomatic rocks= Around the edges of many of the plutons the country rocks have been transformed by heat in a process known as contact metamorphism. The effects of this can be seen up to a distance of 4 miles from the granite in an area called the metamorphic aureole. The effect of this process depends on the type of rocks which were heated and their distance from the intrusion. Fine grained sedimentary rocks were transformed into hornfels and minerals such as amphibole, pyroxene. At greater distances from the plutons, the only evidence of metamorphism is spotting in these rocks. Garnet developed in calcareous rocks as well as amphibole and pyroxene. The metamorphism of greenstones has generally led to the formation of hornblende-plagioclase rocks. A feature of the granites of the batholith is the high concentrations of volatile components. Fluids rich in these have strongly affected the country rock and locally the granites themselves in a process called metasomatism. The first phase recognised is alkali metasomatism (where alkaline components are enhanced), which occurred within and at the margins of the granite. Potassium–metasomatism was followed by sodium–metasomatism. Finally acid metasomatism (enrichment of acid components and depletion of alkalis) took place leading to the formation of greisen and tourmalines. Mineral formation Cassiterite (tin ore) from Botallack Mine, St Just Wolframite from the Camborne-Redruth-St. Day District of Cornwall Lee Moor china clay pit showing hydraulic mining in progress Large mineral deposits are found in the vicinity of the batholith and these have been mined for thousands of years. The area has been famous for its tin since about 2000 BC. The minerals formed when fluids escaped along fractures in the hot granite as it cooled and are typically found in veins or washed into streams to form alluvium. The mineral deposits are associated with multiple lodes and fractures that dip steeply and cut across both the granites and the country rocks. The ore-bearing lodes are up to several kilometres long and are 0.5 to 3m wide on average. =Stages of mineralization= There are four recognised stages of mineralization associated with different conditions as the granite slowly cooled. Each stage is associated with different temperatures, economic deposits of different metals and different gangue minerals. The first three stages have been connected to the intrusion and cooling of the batholith, while the fourth stage may have been driven by the heat production associated with radioactive materials in the granite. ;Stage 1 – exoskarns : The earliest phase of mineralization occurred during the intrusion of the granite. Hot water from the magma which was rich in silica, iron, aluminium, and magnesium mixed and dissolved shales and metabasalts, and converted them into exoskarns in a process called metasomatism, where the chemical composition of rocks is changed by hot water or other fluids. Typical minerals formed at this time include garnet, pyroxene, epidote, chlorine-rich amphiboles, malayaite, vesuvianite, siderite and axinite. The skarns may contain economic amounts of tin, copper, iron and arsenic. These minerals were formed at about the same time as the crystallisation of the pluton they are associated with. Temperatures associated with this stage were 375 – 450 °C. ;Stage 2 – greisen bordered veins and tourmaline veins and breccias : The second recognised phase of mineralization involved the granite being transformed by high-temperature late magmatic fluids rich in volatiles to form greisen and tourmaline. Veins of cassiterite (tin oxide) and wolframite (a mineral containing iron, manganese and tungsten) are found associated with the greisens, the former deposited by high salinity, low , fluids and the latter by low salinity, high fluids. Muscovites within the greisens give cooling ages similar to magmatic muscovites in the relevant granite. ;Stage 3 – the main phase of mineralization : The third and main phase of mineralization occurred at a later stage, and at lower temperatures (200 – 400 °C) as the granite intrusion cooled. Fluids circulating within the country rock leached out tin, copper and arsenic and deposited them in veins which generally lie on an east–west axis. The typical fill of these veins is quartz-tourmaline-chlorite- sulfide-fluorite, with tin, copper, lead, zinc, iron and arsenic sulfides. This mineralization is 25-40 Ma later than the intrusion age for the Carnmenellis pluton. These veins are the main economically useful source of minerals. ;Stage 4 – crosscourses :The fourth and final stage of mineralization was the lowest temperature phase (100 – 170 °C) and is associated with veins containing multiple metallic elements (lead, zinc, silver and uranium). The veins lie on a north–south or northwest–southeast axis and are known as 'crosscourses' because they cross-cut the earlier E-W trending veins. Gangue minerals include quartz, barite and fluorite. Studies on quartz fluid inclusions have shown that the fluids causing this stage are similar in composition to deep sedimentary brines which are rich in sodium, calcium and chlorine. This brine came from Permo-Triassic sedimentary rocks that once covered the entire area. These rocks are still preserved in the Southwest Approaches to the English Channel. Evidence of seawater influence suggests that the mineralization did not start until the Late Triassic marine incursion at the earliest. The high heatflow from the granites helped drive fluid circulation. =China clay= Satellite image of south-west England showing lighter areas that mark the location of china clay workings (labelled) Large economic deposits of china clay are found in places across the south- west peninsula, in particular Lee Moor on the western edge of Dartmoor and the St Austell district. The china clay was formed by the alteration of feldspars in a process known as kaolinization. There is still debate about the origin and age of these deposits but they are commonly thought to arise from the circulation of meteoric water (water from rain or snow) at a late stage during cooling of the batholith. One theory is that the kaolinization resulted from intense supergene weathering in a tropical to warm climate during the Cretaceous to Cenozoic, based on studies of D/H and / ratios.

He was captain of , the vessel that sank a Canadian hospital ship, , in 1918. Patzig evaded prosecution at the Leipzig War Crimes Trials in 1921 because he fled German jurisdiction. During the Second World War he returned to naval service, serving as commander of the 26th U-boat Flotilla, a U-boat training group, from 1943 into 1945. Career =World War I= Patzig was born in the historic German port city of Danzig (now Gdańsk) in 1890, and, as Helmut Patzig, joined the German Navy as a 19-year-old cadet in April 1910. At first assigned to surface ships, the young seaman switched to U-boat service in November 1915, by which time World War I had begun. As a submarine watch officer, Patzig was awarded the Iron Cross – First Class in March 1917. He was assigned to his first sea command, the U-boat U-86, in January 1918. Under Patzig, the U-86 was assigned to patrol the Western Approaches to the British Isles during a pivot-point in the war. By 1918, the Kaiser's fleet of U-boats had acquired sufficient strength to be able to sight, and sink, a substantial percentage of the ships that attempted to deliver necessary supplies to Great Britain. Germany had declared unrestricted submarine warfare against Great Britain, which in its eyes gave it the right to \\"sink on sight\\" ships bound to or from the enemy nation. As commander, Patzig was responsible for the sinking of twenty-four enemy vessels totaling . propagandists published this poster. On 27 June 1918, the U-86 sighted a Canadian hospital ship, , off the southern coast of Ireland. The Llandovery Castle, a former liner of the Union Castle Line, had been requisitioned and converted into a hospital ship. In compliance with the laws of war accepted by all of the European combatant nations – including Germany – at that time, the Llandovery Castle had been marked with painted and lighted Red Crosses to signify its status as a noncombatant vessel. Despite these markings the U-86, under Patzig's command, successfully torpedoed the Llandovery Castle. The sinking hospital ship put out lifeboats, but only one lifeboat and its 24 passengers survived. Multiple witnesses from the survivors reported that the submarine had surfaced and then, under Patzig's command, systematically rammed and sank other lifeboats, and then machine-gunned survivors in the water. This was confirmed in the war crimes trial that followed in Germany after the war, where Patzig's subordinates were found guilty. 234 persons aboard the Llandovery Castle were dead. This story told by Llandovery Castle survivors was extensively publicized as World War I propaganda throughout the United Kingdom, Canada, and the U.S.A. during the remaining months of the war. The victorious Allies believed Patzig was a war criminal, but left the task of prosecution to the former commander's fellow citizens. By returning, in 1921, to his place of birth in the Free City of Danzig, Brümmer-Patzig evaded the jurisdiction of the German courts, and pre- empted court proceedings against him. The indictment against Patzig was quashed in absentia in 1931 as an acknowledgment by the German courts of the enactment, by the Reichstag, of two laws of amnesty that applied to his case. Thus, no testimony was taken in a court of law to set forth Patzig's point of view on the atrocity. =World War II= In World War II Patzig, now under the name Brümmer-Patzig, again saw service in the German navy's U-boat arm. The terms of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles had forced Germany to scuttle its submarine fleet at the end of the war, but when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, he swiftly bypassed the Treaty and ordered the Kriegsmarine to rebuild its U-boat arm. This created a career opportunity for men like Brümmer-Patzig who had been comparatively young submarine commanders during the first war. When war broke out in 1939, Brümmer-Patzig accepted a series of postings, of increasing levels of responsibility, in Germany, occupied France, and the occupied Netherlands. As a middle-aged sea officer, Brümmer-Patzig was not expected to take on a sea command as he had in the first war; he was ordered to specialise in instruction, training, and sea trial duties. However, from January to October 1941, he was nominally in command of , a captured Dutch submarine. From November 1941 until March 1943, he served as a torpedo attack instructor in the 25th U-boat Flotilla, a training group based in the Baltic Sea. In April 1943 he was assigned to command the 26th U-boat Flotilla, another Baltic Sea flotilla of submariners-in-training. In conjunction with these increased duties, he was promoted from Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) to Fregattenkapitän (Commander). Brümmer-Patzig commanded the 26th Flotilla until March 1945, by which time the war was within weeks of its end. Brümmer-Patzig's final appearance on the rolls of the Kriegsmarine is his discharge from service on 3 May 1945, four days before the signing of the German surrender on 7 May. He died on 11 March 1984.

The Shockley–Ramo theorem states that the instantaneous current i induced on a given electrode due to the motion of a charge is given by: : i = E_v q v where :q is the charge of the particle; :v is its instantaneous velocity; and :Ev is the component of the electric field in the direction of v at the charge's instantaneous position, under the following conditions: charge removed, given electrode raised to unit potential, and all other conductors grounded. This theorem has found application in a wide variety of applications and fields, including semiconductor radiation detection and calculations of charge movement in proteins.

It is located east-northeast of Bellefontaine, Ohio. It was closed in 1969. History Bellefontaine Air Force Station was one of twenty- eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 664th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to a temporary site at Lockbourne AFB (L-22) on 1 January 1951 with an AN/TPS-1B radar. In April 1952, the site at Bellefontaine became available and the squadron was moved. At Bellefontaine, the 664th turned on AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radar sets, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 the 664th was operating AN/FPS-20 search and AN/FPS-6 and 6A height-finder radars. During 1959 Bellefontaine AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-06 at Custer Air Force Station, Michigan. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 655th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 September 1959. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66 in 1961. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-73. In addition to the main facility, Bellefontaine AFS operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler site: * Richland Center, Indiana (P-73J) Located atop \\"Mount Nebo\\", the site was transferred to Bellefontaine AFS when Custer AFS, Michigan (Z-67) closed in June 1965. The gap filler was closed in June 1968. By 1966 the site was using an AN/FPS-27. The 664th was inactivated in September 1969 due to budget reductions in ADC and the perceived low threat of an air attack on Lockbourne AFB. Today, the site had been redeveloped as the Ohio Hi-Point Career Center. Many of the former USAF buildings are still in use.

He helped form Australia's central banking system and gave his voice in international economic forums in the years following World War II. He also played an important role in the early years of the Australian National University, serving as its Vice- Chancellor between 1953 and 1960. Early years and background Leslie Melville was born in Sydney in 1902. His father Richard Ernest Melville was of Irish stock, and his mother Lillian Evelyn née Thatcher had English forebears. During World War I, his father lost his job as a bank manager and then invested in a project that failed, bringing the family into severe financial difficulty. This experience helped formulate Leslie's outlook and attitudes to economic matters generally. He won a scholarship to Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore), where he topped the state in mathematics, and was known as the \\"Isaac Newton of Shore\\". While studying engineering at the University of Sydney, he diverged into actuarial studies and then joined the NSW Superannuation Fund. Working full-time meant he could study only subjects he could take at evenings, so he chose economics. Career in economics In 1924, aged only 22, he was appointed Public Actuary for South Australia. In this role he was often called upon to advise the government on economic issues generally. In 1928 he gave evidence on Commonwealth-State economic and financial matters before the Royal Commission on the Australian Constitution, and again in 1929 before the Royal Commission on the Finances of South Australia. In 1929, aged only 27, Melville became the Foundation Professor of Economics at the University of Adelaide. In 1930 he became Chief Economic Adviser to the Commonwealth Bank, a role he held for 23 years. In this role he was at the forefront of the formulation of Australia's policies to combat the Great Depression. Melville represented Australia at the 1932 Ottawa Imperial Trade Conference, after the Prime Minister Joseph Lyons had revoked Sir Robert Gibson's directive for him not to attend. Melville also attended the World Economic Conference in London in 1933.Questia He became a prolific writer on economic matters, contributing greatly to economic debate both at home and internationally. His economic thinking was often out of kilter with his colleagues: he advocated exchange rate fluidity when most were arguing for the status quo. He presented his ideas forcefully at the 1936-37 Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. During World War II, he helped design Australia's war economy. In 1944 Melville led the Australian delegation to the Bretton Woods Conference, which laid the foundations for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). John Maynard Keynes was very impressed with Melville; and he said that Melville: > ... upheld the dignity and integrity of Australia with the most marked > success ... He handled himself most impressively, was clear, cogent and > never unreasonable, put his point forcibly yet moderately, yet achieved ... > as much as was humanly possible to move matters in the direction he desired. > He had quite a difficult task and accomplished it supremely well. In 1950 Melville became Australia's Executive Director of both the World Bank and the IMF. Academic career From 1953 to 1960 he was Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University (ANU). After his retirement, he remained an honorary fellow of the ANU in the Department of Economics at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS). Government appointments When H. C. Coombs was appointed Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, he paid tribute to Melville by advising the government and others that the best man for the job had been overlooked. Melville nevertheless served three terms as a Board Member of the Reserve Bank. When Melville retired, Coombs wrote to him: In the years you were with the Bank, you made a contribution to the theory and practice of central banking which is without equal in the world. In 1960 he became Chairman of the Tariff Board, but clashed repeatedly with the Trade Minister, John McEwen, and he resigned in 1962. In 1966 Melville was appointed Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, remaining in this post until 1974. Personal life In 1925 Melville married Mary Scales in Adelaide. They had two sons, Galfrid (Tig) and Anthony. Sir Leslie Melville celebrated his 100th birthday on 26 March 2002 at Canberra's Commonwealth Club, which he had helped found. He died a month later, on 30 April 2002. At the time of his death, he was survived by his son Anthony, three grandchildren (Jennifer, Elizabeth and Alice) and five great-grandchildren (Michael Kalaf, Henry Kalaf, William Kalaf, Patrick O'Connell and Sophie O'Connell). His close friend Professor Heinz Arndt was to deliver Melville's eulogy, but he died in a car accident while on the way to the funeral. Honours In the New Year's Honours of 1953, Melville was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to the Commonwealth Bank.It's an Honour: CBE In the New Year's Honours of 1957, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order (KBE).It's an Honour: KBE The ANU celebrated his centenary by dedicating an annual lecture series in his name, the Sir Leslie Melville Lecture.

His father Zhang Wenli had taken over the circuit after a mutiny that Zhang Wenli encouraged resulted in the death of Zhang Wenli's adoptive father Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao in 921. Zhang Wenli subsequently died during the campaign waged by Wang Rong's ally Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin to avenge Wang Rong. Zhang Chujin took over the leadership of the circuit after Zhang Wenli's death and tried to hold out against Jin forces, but was captured and killed in 922.  Background  It is not known when or where Zhang Chujin was born. His father Zhang Wenli had been an army officer at Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), but at one point fled to Chengde Circuit and was adopted by Wang Rong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Chengde, who changed his name to Wang Deming.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. Zhang Chujin had at least two younger brothers, Zhang Chuqiu () and Zhang Chuqi ().New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. In 921, Wang Rong was killed in a mutiny at Chengde (which was then known as Zhao as well, as Wang Rong carried the title of Prince of Zhao as its ruler), which Wang Deming had encouraged. The mutineers offered governorship of the circuit to Wang Deming, who accepted, slaughtered Wang Rong's family, and changed his name back to Zhang Wenli. Initially, Wang Rong's ally Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, not wanting to create a new enemy, commissioned Zhang as the acting military governor, but after urging by Wang Rong's former subordinate Fu Xi () (who had been commanding Zhao troops that Wang Rong sent to assist Li Cunxu in his campaigns) and after discovering that Zhang had been communicating with Zhu Zhen the emperor of Jin's archenemy Later Liang and Khitan's Emperor Taizu, launched a general campaign against Zhang, with his generals Yan Bao () and Shi Jiantang () commanding the Jin troops and Fu commanding the Zhao troops. When the combined Jin/Zhao troops captured Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) quickly, Zhang Wenli died in shock. Zhang Chujin kept news of Zhang Wenli's death a secret and took over leadership, continuing to resist the Jin/Zhao troops.  As ruler of Chengde Circuit  The Jin/Zhao troops quickly put Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture () under siege. However, under Zhang Chujin and Zhang Chuqiu's leadership, the Chengde mutineers inflicted a number of unexpected losses on the forces Li Cunxu sent against them from fall 921 to fall 922, including: * Killing Shi Jiantang in battle. * Defeating Yan Bao and forcing his retreat. (Yan subsequently died in shame.) * Inflicting a mortal injury on Li Cunxu's well-regarded cousin Li Sizhao. * Killing Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Cunjin in battle. However, Later Liang refused to aid them. Wang Chuzhi failed to aid him before himself overthrown by his adoptive son Wang Du. Khitan's Emperor Taizu did try to do so, but after Li Cunxu himself intercepted Khitan troops and defeated them, Khitan troops withdrew as well, leaving the Chengde mutineers without aid. When their food supplies ran out, Zhang Chujin sent emissaries to Li Cunxu, offering to surrender; Li Cunxu did not respond. Soon thereafter, Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Cunshen arrived and continued the siege. The city fell, and Zhang Chujin, his brothers, and Zhang Wenli's wife (it is unclear whether she was Zhang Chujin's mother or not) were all captured by Jin troops and delivered to Li Cunxu after their legs were first broken. It appeared that they were executed, for the people of Zhao requested to eat their flesh.

It states that a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e. zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with uniform speed whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body. Details Oresme provided a geometrical verification for the generalized Merton Rule, which we would express today as s = \\\\frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_f)t (i.e., distance traveled is equal to one half of the sum of the initial and final velocities, multiplied by the elapsed time), by finding the area of a trapezoid.C.

Clay tablets used in Babylonian astronomy (350–50 BC) present trapezoid procedures for computing Jupiter's position and motion and anticipate the theorem by 14 centuries. The medieval scientists demonstrated this theorem—the foundation of \\"the law of falling bodies\\"—long before Galileo, who is generally credited with it. Oresme's proof is also the first known example of the modelization of a physical problem as a mathematical function with a graphical representation, as well as of an early form of integration, thus laying the foundation of calculus. The mathematical physicist and historian of science Clifford Truesdell, wrote:Clifford Truesdell, Essays in The History of Mechanics, (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30 The theorem is a special case of the more general kinematics equations for uniform acceleration.

Goodsell (1 July 1900 - 31 March 1988) was an Australian who five times won the professional World Sculling Championship. (\\"Major\\" was his given name, and not a military rank.) He was born at Hunters Hill in New South Wales. His parents were Charles James Goodsell, born 1874 Sydney, and Ada née Lang. In 1917 he married Ruby Eliza Myers in Sydney and they had at least one son (Keith Major Goodsell)B.1921 First attempt Goodsell’s first attempt at winning the Single Sculls World Championship was on 20 September 1924. Goodsell was an up-an-coming sculler and had won the New South Wales amateur championship before turning professional. He challenged the World Title holder, Jim Paddon, for a match with a stake of £200 a side. The race was held on the Richmond River, North Coast district, NSW, Australia. Goodsell was known to be fast over the first mile or two and a good race was expected. He was trying to break the Champion by a fast pace but evidently tried too hard as he capsized after just a quarter of a mile. Although he got back into the boat and continued, the race was effectively over and the Champion just paddled home to win. Winning the championship Jim Paddon was next challenged by another Australian, William (Bill) McDevitt, but Paddon had retired and declined to race, so McDevitt became the Holder by forfeiture. Goodsell challenged McDevitt and the race was run on the Clarance River near Ullmarra on 21 March 1925. The stake was £250 a side. Goodsell won easily by fifteen lengths although the time was a slow 22m.20s. First defence Very shortly afterward, Goodsell was challenged by a New Zealand sculler named Pat Hannan. The race was run on 27 June 1925 on the Parramatta River, Sydney. Goodsell led all the way and easily beat the challenger. He was never fully extended and won by about three lengths. The time was 21m.31s. A crowd estimated at a quarter of a million was quoted to have seen the race. Second defence Jim Paddon came out of retirement and challenged Goodsell for the Title. The match was agreed to be run on the Parramatta on 7 November 1925. Paddon at age thirty-nine was nearing the end of his career and failed to make any sort of \\"come-back\\" and the Champion won easily in a time of 22m.50s. Third defence The next challenger was Tom Saul, also of Australia. The race was again on the Parramatta this time on 3 May 1926 and the stake was £500 a side. The day was fine but the wind made the water choppy. Bill Beach was the umpire. Goodsell won the toss and took the favoured southern side of the course which was about three and a quarter miles long. After the start Saul soon took the lead by a length. Passing Mortlake he tired and Goodsell went to the front and established a two length lead which by the finish was increased to seven lengths. The Champion had won easily in a time of 23m.11s. Fourth defence The next match was unusual in that it took place in Canada. Normally races were held in the Champion’s home country. The challenger was Englishman H.A. (Bert) Barry who was the nephew of Ernest Barry, a Sculling World Champion before World War I. Goodsell travelled to North America and the match was held on Burrand Inlet in Vancouver on 5 September 1927. Goodsell was in fine form and had no trouble in retaining his Title. Fifth defence A return match between Barry and Goodsell was arranged to be run on 6 December 1927 and this race was also held on Burrand Inlet. This time the tables were turned and Barry crossed the finish line in front. A last attempt Bert Barry was a champion for several years but had no challenges in that time. In May 1930 he lost his title in his first defence which was against Ted Phelps, another Englishman. Barry also lost the return match in October of that year. Both these races were on the Thames, London. In the meantime Major Goodsell had emigrated to the United States and remarried. He took out US citizenship, started a new family, and apparently never returned to Australia. Because of the economic depression of the 1930s Phelps was having trouble attracting challenges. Goodsell managed to source sufficient backing for a purse large enough to entice Phelps to cross the Atlantic for a race. The match was arranged to be run on 5 September 1932, at Long Beach, California. This was only the third time a World Title race had occurred in America. The course was the one used for the 1932 Olympic Games which had just concluded. Phelps retained his Championship this time but lost it a year later. Conclusion Goodsell had raced in eight World Title races and won five of them. Only three other men (Ned Hanlan, Richard Arnst, and Evens Paddon) had as many (or more) races in the event, although Bill Beach had more wins for fewer races. After he finished racing Major owned three fishing boats in Ensenada, Baja California. Major also known for roles in movies like the sweetheart of Sigma Chi in America in (1933).

History A group of Purdue University students created a club in 1947 to discuss, listen to, and (later) perform jazz music. This club became semi-official when the university created the Purdue Jazz Society. The Jazz Society's performance group called themselves \\"The Original Peerless Jazz Band\\" at school functions and \\"The Salty Dogs\\" at paid performances at local taverns. Some band members moved to Chicago after graduation and continued to perform as a band. By the late 1950s, there were two \\"Salty Dogs\\" jazz bands: the one in Chicago and the one on the Purdue campus which was still being replenished by newer students. This occasionally led to misunderstandings, including cases in which, after playing at a venue for a few weeks, the campus band would be fired and replaced by the Chicago band. The Chicago band soon adopted the name \\"The Original Salty Dogs\\" in order to minimize such misunderstandings. During the late 1950s, the campus band made a few limited-edition recordings which sold quickly at bookstores and the student union. (Some of these recordings were re-released on compact disc in the 2000s.) Their first widely distributed album was released in 1963 on Audiophile Records. This group soon disbanded as college students began to favor rock music over jazz. Meanwhile, other Chicago-area musicians had joined the Purdue graduates and the Original Salty Dogs were regularly performing at The Red Arrow, The Hunt Club, The Sabre Room and other jazz clubs in city's southwest suburbs. They recorded their first commercial album in 1964 on Delmark Records. The band released more albums on the Delmark, GHB, Jazz & Jazz (Australia) OKOM, Xylophonia and Stomp Off record labels and began to play at festivals throughout the United States. The Original Salty Dogs sometimes performed with The Kingston Trio, George Shearing, The Four Freshmen and other notable artists. Several members moved away from the Chicago area in the early 1970s, making regular performances difficult. Nevertheless, the Original Salty Dogs continue to give occasional performances with many of the same musicians who had joined in the 1950s and '60s.

According to Pausanias it was introduced by Heracles as a prize for the running race winner to honor his father Zeus.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 5.7.7 In the ancient Olympic Games there were no gold, silver, or bronze medals. There was only one winner per event, crowned with an olive wreath made of wild-olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Olive wreaths were given out during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in honor of the ancient tradition, because the games were being held in Greece which was also used as the official emblem. Herodotus describes the following story which is relevant to the olive wreath. Xerxes was interrogating some Arcadians after the Battle of Thermopylae. He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending the Thermopylae. The answer was \\"All other men are participating in the Olympic Games\\". And when asked \\"What is the prize for the winner?\\", \\"An olive-wreath\\" came the answer. Then Tiritantaechmes, one of his generals uttered: \\"Good heavens! Mardonius, what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for virtue.\\"'Herodotus, The Histories, Hdt. 8.26 Aristophanes in Plutus makes a humorous comment on victorious athletes who are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold:Aristophanes, Plutus, 585. > Why, Zeus is poor, and I will clearly prove it to you.

Their deeds were heralded and chronicled so that future generations could appreciate their accomplishments. In fact, the names of the Olympic winners formed the chronology basis of the ancient world, as arranged by Timaeus in his work, The Histories. Amongst the many cultural references concerning the olive wreath, the first line of the first stanza in the Mexican national anthem calls for the motherland, figuratively, to keep hold of the olive wreath surrounding \\"its temples\\", a wreath which was given by a holy archangel, for God himself has already written this motherland's destiny.

Another officer, the head of Jounieh garrison Major Fouad Malek,Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 104. supported the Barakat-led faction, as did Major Saad Haddad the commander of the Marjayoun garrison in southern Lebanon.Kechichian, The Lebanese Army: Capabilities and Challenges in the 1980s (1985), p. 20.El- Kazen, The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon (2000), p. 333.Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 104. These three formations where eventually integrated into the \\"Army of Free Lebanon\\", whose creation was formally announced on March 13, 1976, by Col. Barakat at the Shukri Ghanem Barracks in the Fayadieh district of East Beirut.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), p. 29. Structure =Unit organization= Headquartered at Shukri Ghanem Barracks, a major military facility situated at Fayadieh in the vicinity of the Ministry of Defense complex at Yarze,El-Kazen, The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon (2000), p. 333. the AFL numbered some 3,000 uniformed regulars by 1978, mostly Christian Maronites and Greek-Catholics.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 239. Like the LAA, the AFL also maintained a flexible structure unlike the old regular Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), with the bulk of the force comprising some 1,500-2,000 soldiersJureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), Introduction, p. 1. from different Army units assembled into eight independent mixed combat groups (French: Groupements) of roughly company or battalion size.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), pp. 55-57. There was no set hierarchy, and rank and seniority meant little; performance in the field and political motivation propelled young Army officers – mostly Lieutenants – into leadership positions within the AFL combat groups. By February 1978, they were structured as follows: *Group No 11 (French: Groupement numéro 11) – led by Captain Mounir Bejjani; *Group No 12 (French: Groupement numéro 12) – led by Lieutenants Michel Abou Ghanem and Louis Khoury; *Group No 14 (French: Groupement numéro 14) – led by Lt. Makhoul Hakmeh; *Group No 16 (French: Groupement numéro 16) – led by Lieutenants Abdallah Hadchiti and Ghazi Ghattas;Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), p. 58. *Group No 18 (French: Groupement numéro 18) – led by Maj. Fouad Malek, later replaced by Lt.

All these units were permantely allocated at Fayadieh, serving under Col. Barakat's direct orders. Outside Beirut, a 200-strong battalion designated the \\"Akkar Brigade\\" (Arabic: لواء عكار  Liwa' el-Akkar), led by Lt. Khalil NaderChamussy (René) – Chronique d’une guerre: Le Liban 1975-1977 – éd. Desclée – 1978 was stationed in the Akkar District of northern Lebanon.

The AFL in the Lebanese civil war 1976-78 Closely allied with the Christian rightist militias of the Lebanese Front,Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 104. the AFL battled the leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) militias, the LAA and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla factions at Beirut, but also fought in northern Lebanon. On March 5, 1976, some 200 Christian AFL soldiers led by Lt. Khalil Nader – who entitled themselves the \\"Lebanese Liberation Army\\" (LLA), and later became the \\"Akkar Brigade\\"Chamussy (René) – Chronique d’une guerre: Le Liban 1975-1977 – éd. Desclée – 1978 – from the Jounieh garrison departed without permission from their commanding Officer to their home towns of Al-Qoubaiyat and Andaket in the Akkar District of Northern Lebanon, which were being threatened by LAA attacks and artillery bombardments.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), Appendix B, B-16.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 45.Menargues, Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban (2004), p. 37.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), p. 23. On March 13 at Beirut, the AFL units from the Shukri Ghanem Barracks in Fayadieh under Col. Barakat clashed with the Officer cadets of the adjoining Military Academy, whose Commander supported Brigadier general Aziz El-Ahdab's failed coup attempt against President Frangieh,El-Kazen, The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon (2000), p. 333. despite the fact that some officers from the AFL (Fouad Malek, Wehbeh Katicha, Ghazi Ghattas) had signed a petition pledging their support to Gen. Ahdab's initiative.Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 103.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), pp. 28-29. Later on March 25, Col. Barakat's troops bolstered the hard-pressed Republican Guard battalion and Marada Brigade militiamen loyal to President Frangieh in defending the Presidential Palace at Baabda from a two-pronged combined LNM-Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) ground assault amid intense shelling, though prior to the attack the President had decamped to the safety of Zouk Mikael, near Jounieh, and later to Kfour in the Keserwan District.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 46-47.Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 101.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), p. 30. They also provided armour and artillery support to the Christian militias on the closing stages of the Battle of the Hotels,O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 54; 56-57. during which an artillery barrage fired by a unit under Barakat's command struck the campus of the American University of Beirut at Rue Bliss in the neighboring Ras Beirut district, causing a number of casualties among the students. On late March–early April 1976 the AFL, aided by the Internal Security Forces (ISF), fought off successfully an attempt by the LAA and the Druze People's Liberation Army (PLA) militia to raid their own Headquarters at the Shukri Ghanem Barracks complex in the Fayadieh district of East Beirut.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), pp. 20-23.Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 115. Under the command of Maj. Fouad Malek, AFL units resumed the same roles later in the sieges of the PLO-held Palestinian refugee camps of Jisr el-Basha and Tel al-Zaatar at East Beirut between June and August 1976.. During the Hundred Days' War in early February 1978, the AFL found itself besieged and bombarded by the Syrian Army in their Fayadieh barracks, though they later helped the NLP Tigers and the newly constituted Lebanese Forces' Command in driving the Syrians out from East Beirut.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 72-73. Disbandment On March 1977, the newly elected President of Lebanon Elias Sarkis began slowly to reorganize the battered Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) structure, which had split into four sectarian factions.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 63. The first fraction of the AFL to be re-integrated into the official battle order of the re-organized Lebanese Army in June 1977 was the Jounieh garrison, whose commander Fouad Malek was promoted to Colonel and sent to the École de Guerre in Paris, where he deserted in 1978 to become the head of the Lebanese Forces (LF) official representation at the French Capital.Micheletti and Debay, Les Forces Libanaises, RAIDS magazine (1989), p. 34 (box). In March 1978 at Beirut, Col. Barakat handed over the Fayadieh barracks back to the official authorities, thus effectively signalling the disbandment of the AFL and the return of his troops to the LAF structure. Promoted to Brigadier general, Antoine Barakat was then appointed as Military Attaché to the Embassy of Lebanon in Washington, D.C., where he retired. Nearly all the remaining AFL combat group commanders' were rapidly re- integrated into the LAF, which enabled them to pursue their military careers unhindered – Lt. Makhoul Hakmeh eventually rose to the rank of Colonel and went to serve with General Michel Aoun as commander of the 10th Airmobile Brigade during the Elimination War in 1988-1990. One notable exception was Captain Samir el-Achkar and his commando battalion (Arabic: Maghaweer), who contested the re-integration process. Accused on 23 February 1978 by Colonel Sami El-Khatib, the commander of the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF), of being the instigator of the incident that sparked the Hundred Days' War, Capt. el-Achkar refused to be put on trial by a military court on charges of desertion and treason, rebelling a few days later with his troops by establishing the Lebanese Army Revolutionary Command (LARC), another dissident faction of the Lebanese Army closely aligned with the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) militia led by Bashir Gemayel. The crisis came to an abrupt end on 1 November that year, when the LAF Command ordered a raid by a 300-strong commando detachment from the Counter-sabotage regiment (Arabic: Moukafaha) on the LARC headquarters at Mtaileb in the Matn District, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of Capt. Samir el-Achkar, followed by the full re- incorporation of his men into the official Para-commando Regiment's own structure.Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), pp. 61-63. A different fate however, awaited the ex-AFL troops of the Marjayoun garrison in the south. By late 1976, pressure from PLO and LNM-LAA militias finally forced Major Saad Haddad to evacuate the town and withdraw unopposed with his battalion to the village of Qlaiaa, close to the border with Israel. Here Maj. Haddad and his men placed themselves under the protection of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF),Barak, The Lebanese Army – A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 104. eventually providing the cadre – after merging with local Christian, Shia Muslim and Druze militias, gathered since October 21 into the informal \\"Army for the Defense of South Lebanon\\" or ADSL (French: Armée de Défense du Liban-Sud or ADLS)Hokayem, L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985) (2012), p. 43. – of the so-called \\"Free Lebanese Army\\" (FLA), later to become known as the South Lebanon Army (SLA).Chamussy (René) – Chronique d'une guerre: Le Liban 1975-1977 – éd.

It is significant by dint of the properties having been owned, during 1892-1945, by the Working Girls' Vacation Society of New York City, and used as a summer retreat for working women from the city. The society is similar to the Young Women's Christian Association, founded in 1866, in that it is one of many organizations intending to \\"minister to the 'temporal, moral and religious welfare of self-supporting women.' Led by enlightened upper class philanthropist/reformers such as copper heiress Grace Dodge, a national network of \\"working girls' clubs\\" formed in the 1880s. Their mission primarily was to protect the morality of working women, rather than to improve the conditions of the workplace (note 4); their means included the creation of opportunities for social intercourse, self-improvement (education), and recreation in a morally uplifting setting. The New York Working Girls' Club, founded by Dodge in 1883 and the first of its kind in the nation, maintained, for example, a clubhouse with a library and extensive series of lectures, classes, and social events (note 5). The employment- related health needs of working girls were not ignored. The Working Girls' Vacation Society of New York, an offshoot of the Working Girls' Club, was founded in 1883 to provide summer vacations in the country for women with demonstrated health problems. The founders of the society included prominent upper-class women and social workers (note 6). In a pattern repeated in other cities, the Vacation Society made available low-cost stays generally of two weeks in duration at rural locations (note 7).\\" A total of 411 working girls were assisted by the society in the summer of 1884. By 1915 the society had created several retreats in Connecticut and served 1450. The district includes three side-by-side properties on a rural road in East Haddam, Connecticut, with three houses and three barns. When listed, the district included six contributing buildings and one non-contributing building. Three of the six are residences. The Phebe Howell House (c.1835), is constructed with pegged post- and-beam framing, and shows what may be its original clapboard siding. It and the Charles Howell House (c.1825) are constructed on granite ashlar foundations. The latter's doorway is flanked by fluted pilasters. A vernacular bungalow house (c.1915) is the other. and The three other contributing buildings are 19th-century, wood-frame barns. The one at 66 Mill Road (photograph 5 in accompanying photos) \\"is similar in size and design to the ell on the Phebe Howell House, which tends to confirm oral history that this barn was formerly attached to the rear of the Charles Howell House.\\" DiNapoli, writing in 1892, describes the working girls' plight. The association renamed in 1950 to become the Katherine Herbert Fund, named after the 1885 founder of the society. In 1974 it merged with the Stony Wold Corporation, an organization that had focused upon tuberculosis, to become the Stony Wold- Herbert Fund.

One of the activists of the Albanian National Awakening and the leader of the Albanian irregulars from 1909 to 1914, he became the prefect of police of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë from 1916 until his execution due to a miscarriage of justice by a French military tribunal in 1917.  Biography  = Family = Themistokli was born in Gërmenji family in Korçë in 1871. His family was originally from Gërmenj, a village of modern- day Kolonje -County of Albania, near border with Greece. Themistokli's grandfather Demetrius moved from Gërmenj to Korçë in 1860 and adopted Gërmenji as his last name. Because of economic reasons Themistokli's father Atanas moved from Korçë, first to Egypt and then to Bucharest and Istanbul. His mother Konstandina, wife Katarina, three sons (Spiro, Telemakun and Themistokli) and two daughters (Aleksandra and Efterpina) remained in Korçë. = Career = After receiving his first education in Korçë, Themistokli emigrated to Romania in 1892 in search of work and settled in Bucharest at the age of 21. In Bucharest he was influenced by the rise of patriotic societies in the Albanian community. He returned to Korça and Monastir, where he and his brother opened the Liria (Freedom) Hotel, a center of the nationalist movement. That hotel was a centre of the Albanian activism of the Albanian National Awakening in planning the Congress of Monastir and Albanian revolts in the period 1909—1912. Gërmenji was a supporter of the cooperation with Bulgarians. In 1911, he traveled to Italy and Greece to find support. In 1911 he was declared persona non grata in Greece because he refused to agree not to carry on nationalistic propaganda south of Vlora as a condition for cooperation with the Greek authorities against the Ottoman Empire. Gërmenji led an Albanian guerilla band composed of different religions and social classes fighting against the Ottoman Empire. While operating between Saranda and Gjirokastra, attempting to capture the military supplies of Ottoman army, he was seized and imprisoned in Ioannina. When he returned to Korça, he led one of two groups of Albanian irregulars around the region, when Albania was fragmented during the First World War (the other was led by Sali Butka). He subsequently led the guerrilla forces in the Balkan Wars. During the first stages of the conflict between units of the Principality of Albania and the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus he participated at the battle of his native Korça, where the Albanian forces defended unsuccessfully the town against the attack by the forces of the pro-Greek Northern Epirus movement. Gërmenji fled to Sofia when Greek army reoccupied Korça in 1915. In October 1916, he traveled to Pogradec, which was occupied by Austrian and Bulgarian troops, to seek Austrian assistance. When he realized he would receive no help, he turned to the French, who had taken Korça in October 1916. = Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë = Monument dedicated to Themistokli Gërmenji in the main square of Korçë French officers had a meeting with Gërmenji on November 24, 1916, before the French army occupied Korçë on November 29. Themistokli Gërmenji came to Korçë from Pogradec, which was occupied by the armies of Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria during Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian occupation of Albania. The French officers appointed a commission led by Gërmenji. The commission held a meeting on December 10 at 9 a.m. in the Saint George's School and Gërmenji gave a speech to the gathered men; after the meeting he led the commission to the prefecture. In the prefecture they met with Colonel Descoins and other French officers. Haki Shemshedini approached Colonel Descoins on behalf of the commission. Colonel Descoins informed the commission that they should sign a protocol, which they did: the protocol stipulated that an autonomous province would be established on the territories of Korçë, Bilishti, Kolonja, Opar and Gora. It was also agreed that the 14 members of the commission would make up the administrative council, responsible for maintaining the order. On December 10, 1916, Henry Descoin, the commander of the French garrison of Korçë, after the approval from Maurice Sarrail, declared the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë, and appointed Gërmenji as prefect. The new authorities in Korçë organized the police force and gendarmerie, a post office system and issued the postage stamps. Gërmenji set up Albanian schools throughout the villages of the region and discontinued the use of Turkish and Greek. Gërmenji was awarded with the Croix de guerre because he participated in the French capture of Pogradec with the battalion from Korçë. At the end of 1917 however Gërmenji was accused of collaboration with the Central Powers and summarily executed on 7 November in Thessaloniki after being sentenced to death by a French military court. It later became clear that the military tribunal had made a grave judicial error, its members having been led astray by Greek informers who wished Germenji removed since he was a powerful Albanian leader.

A lighthouse on the point marks the northern entrance to The Minch. Geography The peninsula is about 6 km long and 3 km wide, and has a number of scattered small settlements including Culkein, Balchladich and Achnacarnin. The lighthouse is at grid reference NC003330 at the end of a 5 km long track which branches off the B869 Lochinver to Unapool road. Further North up the coast are the Old Man of Stoer and the Point of Stoer, which can easily be reached from the lighthouse on foot. Around 10,000 visitors visit the lighthouse each year, necessitating the construction of a public toilet in 2013. The two keepers cottages have are now holiday homes. Lighthouse Mural depicting the east elevation of the Stoer Lighthouse in the Stoer Lighthouse Stores Bothy =Construction= Stoer Head Lighthouse was built on Stoer Head by brothers David and Thomas Stevenson in 1870 after being identified as one of forty-five sites in Scotland where a lighthouse was necessary to protect shipping. The lighthouse is high, making it squat in appearance, but the height of the cliffs on which it sits means it can be seen at a distance of out at sea. The beacon flashes four white every fifteen seconds. Sea transport in the 1870s being the only feasible option for this remote site, the stone and other materials for the lighthouse were landed on a jetty built for the purpose about a mile to the south east of the lighthouse. No doubt, supplies for the lighthouse were similarly transported until roads became passable in the 20th century. The jetty (Ordnance Survey grid reference NC013320) is now in disrepair. Close to the jetty is the Stoer Lighthouse Stores bothy which was used by the men building the lighthouse. In the bothy there is a mural depicting the east elevation of the Stoer lighthouse: the mural probably dates from the 1800s, certainly predating the sale of the bothy in the 1960s. The neighbouring (inland) bothy is known as the Salmon Bothy and was used to store salmon. =Manual operation= The lighthouse in 2016 The lighthouse was manned by a Principal lighthouse keeper and assistant until 1978, when it was automated. The remoteness of the assignment necessitated a degree of self-sufficiency, and there is ample evidence of their occupation, with the remains of the former byre, stable, cow shed, pig house and cart shed still visible nearby. The children were educated at the local school at Stoer for their primary education, but had to move to a boarding school for their senior studies as there was no senior school in the county of Sutherland. =Present day= The lighting is now provided by an array of sealed beam electric lamps, operated by a sensor to automatically turn them on and off at specified light levels. Upkeep is carried out by a local who visits on a regular basis to carry out basic maintenance and cleaning, and technicians from the Northern Lighthouse Board who visit on an annual basis.

It occurs when the phytochemical capsaisin, which can be present in very high concentrations in certain varieties of chili peppers, (especially with superhot peppers such as ghost peppers or carolina reapers) contacts cutaneous free nerve endings which are present in high density in the finger tips of its victims.

Life and times =Early life and career in Army= Falcón was born in Buenos Aires. He enrolled at the National Military College and graduated with honors in 1873. He served as aide de camp to President Domingo Sarmiento and was enlisted in the Conquest of the Desert campaign. He co-founded the Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata football club in 1887; CGE would become the oldest association football team in continuous existence in the Americas. He retired from the Army in 1898 with the rank of Colonel, and was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies for Buenos Aires on the ruling National Autonomist Party ticket. Amid growing civil unrest, President José Figueroa Alcorta appointed Falcón as Chief of the Argentine Federal Police upon taking office in 1906. Figueroa Alcorta believed that, led by a military officer, the Federal Police would be better able to react to and control protests. Accordingly, Falcón established the Cadets' Training Academy, streamlined the force's administration, and had new uniforms designed. =Chief of Police= Caras y Caretas, 1909. Simón Radowitzky The first significant test of Falcón's mettle as chief of police was the Tenants' Strike of 1907. Falcón initiated dialogue with strike organizers, who were mainly women and whose demands centered around rising rents and deteriorating conditions in the city's estimated 2,000 tenements. Ultimately, however, talks broke down, and protests associated with the strike was quelled with the use of mounted police armed with sabres. Rent strikers themselves were evicted from their homes in July (a winter month in the Southern Hemisphere) with the use of high-pressure hoses and cold water. Falcón became known for personally supervising repressive action against protests, and his sabre-wielding officers, as \\"cossacks.\\" The most violent such confrontation up to then took place during a May Day demonstration organized in 1909 by FORA, an anarchist labor organization. Following an address on Lorea Square by one of the rally's organizers, Federal Police officers charged the crowd and left a tally of 11 dead and over 100 injured. The incident prompted a general strike led by FORA, and the ensuing repression ordered by Falcón resulted in what became known as the Semana Roja (\\"Red Week\\"). The carriage that took Falcón after being destroyed by the Simón Radowitzky's bomb. Falcón ordered the dispersal of the crowd of an estimated 60,000 people who had gathered for the funeral cortège for those killed. The 4,000 gathered at Chacarita Cemetery for their burial were likewise dispersed, and the coffins themselves were seized by police. He later ordered La Vanguardia (published by the Socialist Party of Argentina) and La Protesta Humana (published by FORA) closed, and had their printing presses destroyed. FORA and the Socialist UGT were granted an audience with the President of the Argentine Senate, Benito Villanueva, and obtained the commutation of lengthy prison sentences for those arrested (which per municipal statutes carried a term of triple that of similar offenses not committed in the context of a protest). They demanded that Falcón resign, though he refused to do so; members of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange led a rally in his support as President Figueroa Alcorta commended him for his efforts. The Chief of Police and his executive secretary, Juan Lartigau, attended the funeral of the Director of the National Penitentiary of Buenos Aires, Antonio Ballvé, on November 14, 1909. As their carriage returned from the service, however, a homemade bomb was thrown therein by a Ukrainian Argentine anarchist militant, Simón Radowitzky. Its two occupants died on the way to hospital, and Falcón was buried at La Recoleta Cemetery. =Legacy= President Figueroa Alcorta declared a state of siege and, in 1910, signed the Law of Social Defense, which expedited the deportation of those considered \\"agitators.\\" Radowitzky was sentenced to life imprisonment and remanded to the custody of the National Penitentiary in Ushuaia. He escaped briefly in 1911 and was ordered to submit to solitary confinement for twenty days on each anniversary of Falcón's assassination. Radowitzky's sentence was commuted by President Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1930, and he died in 1956. Numerous streets in Buenos Aires and a rural town in Coronel Pringles Partido were named in his honor. The police training academy was, however, renamed in 2011 for Juan Ángel Pirker, Chief of Federal Police from 1986 to 1989.

Starring Rory Calhoun, William Bendix, Richard Jaeckel, and Manuel Padilla, Jr., it was written by Ronald Davidson, Beirne Lay, Jr., and Harry M. Slott, directed by Francis D.

Lyles.Theiapolis Cinema http://cinema.theiapolis.com/movie-1THC/the-young-and- the-brave/technical-details.html Shot on location in Ventura County, California, the film has been recognized by Turner Classic Movies (TCM) as a historical representation of the war film genre. Preserved in their archives in 2006, the film is widely distributed through the network.  Plot  During the Korean War, three American prisoners of war – Sgt Ed Brent (Rory Calhoun), Staff Sgt Peter Kane (William Bendix), and Pvt Kirk Wilson (Robert Ivers) – escape from their North Korean captors and try to make it back to American lines, about away. At the beginning of their trek, they are given shelter by a Korean couple, who have a young son Han (Manuel Padilla). While Han is hiding in nearby hills, the North Korean captors who are pursuing the three escapees kill the couple. The three Americans elude the North Korean pursuers and encounter Han with his companion dog Lobo (Flame, German Shepherd), an abandoned K-9 corps police dog.American Movie Classics (AMC) http://movies.amctv.com/person/23769/Flame-the-Dog/overview While eating some of their few K-rations, which the three share with Han and the dog, the three Americans discuss whether they should bring Han and the dog with them on their trek to the American lines. Brent is in favor of bringing them along and, as ranking officer, orders the other two to do so. Kane opposes bringing the boy and the dog because of the drain they would pose on their few rations. Kane appeals to Wilson to out-vote Brent, based on the assertion that after being held captive, rank no longer matters. Wilson, showing no conviction either way, sides with Kane. However, they eventually agree with Brent and the five proceed on the trek. Along the way, Han confides to Kane that he doesn’t like him because Kane didn’t try to save his parents from the North Koreans. Kane convinces Han that there wasn’t anything they could do as escaped prisoners with no weapons. Kane befriends Han and leads him to believe that he could be adopted and go to America. Cpl John Estway (Richard Jaeckel), a fourth escaped prisoner who was brainwashed, is encountered on their trek. He is carrying a two-way radio recovered from a broken-down Jeep, but the batteries that powered it have been depleted. They agree the radio would be useful in summoning help, if they could find replacement batteries. While traveling through brush, Wilson, who is in the lead, steps on a land mine and is killed. Han starts to return to the three remaining men, but is prevented from stepping on a second land mine by the dog Lobo, who is able to sense it through smell. They decide Lobo would be a valuable resource and use him to sniff out more land mines along their path. After running out of K-rations, they split up to search for food. Han discovers a wild pig in a thicket, which Kane captures and kills. While discussing how to cook it, someone suggests that they first skin it. Han asks if they have pigs in America and says you don’t skin a pig but rather roast it whole over an open fire. After doing so and enjoying a wonderful meal, they muse about how bright Han is for a child that they figure to be 9 or 10 years old. They come upon a grass-thatched farmhouse and wonder whether it is occupied. Upon seeing a radio antenna on the roof, they surmise that they might find batteries for their radio inside. They hesitate to approach the house because enemy North Koreans might occupy it. Han suggests that he should go and ask for food under the assumption that the enemy, if there, would take him as an innocent child. The men are amazed at how clever and brave the boy is and agree to his plan. There are enemy soldiers inside, and they react violently to the presence of the boy. They come out, shoot the boy in the leg and search for the suspected escapees. Two of the enemy approach the three hidden Americans, who ambush them. Kane and Estway don the fallen enemy’s uniforms and pretend to hold Brent under arrest. The three approach the other North Korean soldiers and when they get close, they open fire and kill them all. The wounded boy meanwhile has fled to escape the North Koreans. After finding batteries in the farmhouse, they make radio contact with a nearby American base, which sends a helicopter to pick them up. They search for Han, but can't find him. The helicopter arrives but the three prisoners of war won't leave without the boy. The helicopter pilot informs them that he can only carry two of them at a time and insists that two of them get aboard. Eventually Estway gets aboard alone and the helicopter flies away. The other two continue to search for Han. The helicopter returns shortly under gunpoint from Estway and drops a note saying that Han was spotted in the next canyon, which has been infiltrated by many enemy soldiers and would soon be under barrage by American forces. Brent and Kane hike to that canyon and spot Han, but are caught under fire by both sides. In the process, the dog Lobo is fatally shot and Brent is wounded in the knee. They reach Han and shortly later are rescued by American infantrymen. After being transported to the American base camp, they are charged with disobeying orders to board the helicopter and Estway is charged for holding the pilot at gunpoint. Kane, however, insists on explaining the entire situation to the commanding colonel who finally agrees they are really heroes. The commander discovers that Han is only seven years old and marvels at how young and brave he is. Kane tells Han that he still has two years left in his enlistment and won’t be able to adopt Han and take him to America. However, Kane convinces both the boy and Brent that Brent should adopt the boy since Brent would be returning to America shortly because of his wound. Han leaves with Brent to the hospital and Kane is left displaying a feeling of accomplishment at the end.  Cast  *Rory Calhoun as Sgt.

Klamath Water Users Protective Assn., 532 U.S. 1 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned whether Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act, which applies to \\"intra agency memoranda or letters\\", is applicable to documents within the Department of the Interior which discussed plans for the allocation of water in the Klamath River Basin. The Court held unanimously that the exemption did not apply. Background The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation administered the Klamath Irrigation Project, which uses water from the Klamath River Basin to irrigate parts of Oregon and California. In order for the Department to provide water allocations among competing uses and users, it asked the Klamath and other Indian Tribes to consult with the Bureau of Reclamation over future allocations. A memorandum of understanding solidified this relationship. When the Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs filed claims on behalf of the Klamath Tribe in Oregon to allocate water rights, the two exchanged written memoranda on the appropriate scope of the claims submitted by the Government for the benefit of the Tribe. Afterwards, the Klamath Water Users Protective Association, a nonprofit group whose members receive water from the Project and, generally, have interests adverse to the tribal interest because of the scarcity of water, filed requests with the Bureau under the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to communications between the Bureau and the Basin Tribes. Some documents were turned over, but the Bureau held other documents under the deliberative process privileges incorporated in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure \\"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\\" The Association sued to compel release of the documents. The District Court granted the government summary judgment, rejecting the attempt to attain the documents. In reversing, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled out any application of Exemption 5 on the ground that the Tribes with whom the Department had consultations with have a direct interest in the subject matter of the consultations. The ultimate decision by the Supreme Court took less than three months from oral argument to the opinion being released.531 U.S. at 4. Opinion of the Court Justice David Souter wrote the unanimous opinion of the Court which affirmed the Ninth Circuit. The Court agreed with the appellate court that there is no exemption under FOIA for the internal documents between the Klamath tribe and the Bureau which dealt with the water allocation issue.531 U.S. at 12. This is because in the correspondence the Bureau did not act in the role that their personnel usually fulfils, in that personnel do not represent their own interests. The Bureau officials were working with the Tribe, advocating their interests which meant the documents were not exempt from public disclosure of intra-agency communications. Souter wrote that \\"all of this boils down to requesting that we read an 'Indian trust' exemption into the statute, a reading that is out of the question\\". In concluding, Souter noted that Congress realized that not every secret under the previous version of FOIA would be kept secret under the newer version.

The operations, planned by Carter County minister William B. Carter (1820-1902) and authorized by President Abraham Lincoln, called for the destruction of nine strategic railroad bridges, followed by an invasion of the area by Union Army forces then in southeastern Kentucky. The conspirators managed to destroy five of the nine targeted bridges, but the Union Army failed to move, and would not invade East Tennessee until 1863, nearly two years after the incident. The destruction of the bridges, all of which were quickly rebuilt, had almost no military impact. However, the attacks caused a shift in the way the Confederate authorities regarded East Tennessee's Union sympathizers. Parts of the area were placed under martial law, and dozens of known Unionists were arrested and jailed. Several suspected bridge burners were tried and convicted, being sentenced to death. This in turn brought increased pressure on Lincoln to send Union troops to occupy East Tennessee. A pro-Union newspaper publisher, William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, used the arrests and hangings as propaganda in his 1862 anti-secession diatribe, Sketches of the Rise, Progress and Decline of Secession.William G. Brownlow, Sketches of the Rise, Progress and Decline of Secession (Philadelphia: G.W. Childs, 1862), pp. 271-285, 297-313. Background As secessionist sentiment raged through the South in late 1860 and early 1861, a majority of East Tennesseans, like many in the Appalachian highlands, stubbornly remained loyal to the Union.David Madden, \\"Unionist Resistance to Confederate Occupation: The Bridge Burners of East Tennessee,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vols. 52-53 (1980-1981), pp. 22-40. Slavery was not very important to the East Tennessee economy, and the region had been at odds with the state government for decades over a lack of state appropriations for internal improvements. Furthermore, the Whig Party and its successors dominated large parts of East Tennessee, and its adherents viewed with suspicion the actions of the predominantly- Democratic Southern legislatures.Eric Lacy, Vanquished Volunteers: East Tennessee Sectionalism from Statehood to Secession (Johnson City, Tenn.: East Tennessee State University Press, 1965), pp. 122-126. Tennessee as a whole voted to secede from the Union in a referendum held on June 8, 1861, but nearly two-thirds of East Tennesseans rejected the referendum and remained sympathetic to the Union. At the Greeneville session (June 17-20) of the East Tennessee Convention, the region's Unionist leaders condemned secession and petitioned the Tennessee General Assembly to allow East Tennessee to become a separate state and remain in the Union. The legislature rejected the petition, and Governor Isham Harris ordered Confederate forces under General Felix K. Zollicoffer into East Tennessee.Larry Whiteaker, Civil War. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 25 January 2011. Planning =Camp Dick Robinson= The East Tennessee and Georgia (ET&G;) and East Tennessee and Virginia (ET&V;) railroads were vital to the Confederacy, since they provided a connection between Virginia and the Deep South that did not require going around the bulk of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Both Union and Confederate leaders realized the railroads' importance. In July 1861, Confederate politician and East Tennessee native Landon Carter Haynes warned of the railroads' vulnerability, stating that at any moment he was \\"looking to hear that the bridges have been burned and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad torn up.\\"James Bellamy, \\"The Political Career of Landon Carter Haynes,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 28 (1956), pp. 117-118. Shortly after the General Assembly rejected the Greeneville Petition, Reverend William Blount Carter, a delegate of the Greeneville convention, travelled to Camp Dick Robinson in Kentucky, where many of East Tennessee's Unionists had fled to enlist in the Union Army. He met with generals George H. Thomas and William T. Sherman, and his brother, Samuel P. Carter, a U.S. Navy officer who had been appointed a general in the Union Army. William Carter revealed his plan to destroy the region's main railroad bridges to pave the way for a Union invasion. Thomas liked the plan, and although Sherman was initially skeptical, he agreed after a short discussion. Carrying a letter from Thomas, Carter travelled to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Lincoln, Commanding General George McClellan, and Secretary of State William H. Seward. Lincoln, under immense pressure from Senator Andrew Johnson and Congressman Horace Maynard to provide some sort of aid to East Tennessee's Unionists, agreed with the plan. He allotted $2,500 for the operation, and Carter returned to Camp Dick Robinson to begin making arrangements. =Recruiting= Bridges targeted by the bridge burners on the night of November 8, 1861; the red squares indicate bridges that were successfully destroyed; Knoxville and Chattanooga are shown for reference The nine bridges targeted were, from northeast to southwest: the bridge over the Holston River at Union (modern Bluff City); the bridge over the Watauga River at Carter's Depot (modern Watauga); the bridge over Lick Creek, near modern Mosheim in Greene County; the bridge over the Holston at Strawberry Plains; the bridge over the Tennessee River at Loudon; the bridge over the Hiwassee River at Charleston; two bridges over Chickamauga Creek in the vicinity of Chattanooga; and the bridge over the Tennessee at Bridgeport, Alabama. All were on the ET&V; or ET&G; lines with the exception of the Bridgeport bridge, which was on the Memphis and Charleston, and one of the Chickamauga Creek bridges, which was on the Western and Atlantic. In mid-October 1861, Carter set up a \\"command post\\" in Kingston, Tennessee. Captains David Fry and William Cross, two officers who had been assigned to the operation, were tasked with burning the Lick Creek and Loudon bridges, respectively (although Cross's role has never been fully verified). Carter recruited Alfred Cate (1822-1871) of Hamilton County, to oversee the destruction of the bridges in southeast Tennessee, and assigned the two bridges in northeast Tennessee to Daniel Stover, a son-in-law of Andrew Johnson. For the Strawberry Plains bridge, he recruited former Sevier County sheriff William C. Pickens. Each of Carter's \\"lieutenants\\" in turn recruited reliable men to assist them. Cate assigned R.B. Rogan and James Keener to the Bridgeport bridge, William T. Cate (his brother) and W. H. Crowder to the Chickamauga Creek bridges, and personally led the attack on the Hiwassee bridge, with the assistance of Thomas Cate (another brother), Adam Thomas, and Jesse and Eli Cleveland. Fry chose Greene Countians Jacob and Thomas Harmon, Jacob Hensie, Alex Haun, and Harrison and Hugh Self. Pickens recruited several fellow Sevier Countians, among them David Ray, James Montgomery, and Elijah Gamble. The attacks Depiction of the attacks in Barton's A Hero In Homespun While Carter recruited conspirators, Union forces at Camp Dick Robinson prepared to march south to Knoxville. A raid into Kentucky by Zollicoffer, though repulsed, changed the timing of the invasion, however, and following Confederate excursions into the western part of the state, Sherman became concerned that his line was stretched too thin. Thomas arrived at Crab Orchard, Kentucky, about from Cumberland Gap, on October 31, and pleaded with Sherman to give the go-ahead. Sherman was unconvinced, however, and called off the invasion on November 7. The bridge burners, unaware of the shift in strategy in Kentucky, proceeded with their plans on the night of November 8. The Chickamauga Creek and Hiwassee bridges were poorly guarded, and Cate and his men burned them with minimal effort. The Bridgeport, Loudon, and Watauga bridges were heavily guarded by Confederate soldiers, and conspirators abandoned their attempts to destroy them. The Lick Creek and Union bridges were guarded only by one or two sentries each, whom the conspirators easily overpowered before setting fire to the bridges. At the Strawberry Plains bridge, Pickens and his crew encountered a lone Confederate guard, James Keeling (also spelled Keelan in some sources). When Pickens attempted to light a torch, Keeling spotted him, and attacked. In the ensuing melee, both Keeling and Pickens were badly wounded. Keeling fled, leaving the bridge exposed, but Pickens had lost the group's matches in the chaos and darkness. Unable to light a fire, the group aborted their mission and returned to Sevier County. Aftermath =Confederate response= News of the bridge burnings thrust East Tennessee's Confederate leaders into what Knoxville attorney Oliver Perry Temple described as a \\"wild and unreasonable panic.\\" The Confederate government in Richmond was flooded with exaggerated reports of rising Unionist activity in the region. Confederate district attorney J.C. Ramsey vowed to hang anyone involved in the conspiracy, and Zollicoffer, who had initially followed a more lenient policy, rounded up and jailed dozens of known Unionists. After some consideration by the military and Confederate government, Confederate War Secretary Judah P. Benjamin issued an order. \\"All such as can be identified in having been engaged in bridge-burning are to be tried summarily by drum-head court martial, and, if found guilty, executed on the spot by hanging in the vicinity of the burned bridges\\".Benjamin, Judah P. Letter to Col. W. B. Wood, November 25, 1861, found at website http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM58KD_Execution_Of_The_BridgeBurners Several were found guilty, and five were hanged. For those who had not participating in the burnings, but had otherwise been identified as part of the organized Unionists, Benjamin ordered, \\"All such as have not been engaged are to be treated as prisoners of war\\" and were to be transported and be held as such. Among the detained Unionists were several Lick Creek bridge conspirators, identified by one of the Confederate sentries they had captured and freed. Confederate authorities also arrested Samuel Pickens (father of William), physician Robert H. Hodsden, and Edmond and William Hodges, all of Sevier County; William Hunt and former Knoxville Register editor John M. Fleming, both of Knox County; Montgomery Thornburgh, James Meek and Samuel Johnson, all of Jefferson County; and Levi Trewhitt of Bradley County. =Trials and executions= Passers-by abusing the corpses of conspirators Hensie and Fry, as depicted in Brownlow's Sketches Confederate judge West H. Humphreys, citing lack of evidence, threw out many of the cases against the accused Unionists, agitating Ramsey and the Confederate military authorities. On November 30, Zollicoffer suspended habeas corpus and instituted martial law, implementing Benjamin's order to try the accused by court martial. Pro- Union attorneys John Baxter and Oliver Perry Temple provided legal defense, though they realized the accused stood little chance of acquittal, and typically had the accused read statements denouncing the court martial as illegal. Among the conspirators, the Lick Creek bridge burners suffered the greatest number of executions. Jacob Hensie and Henry Fry were both tried and hanged in sight of the railroad at Greeneville on November 30, 1861. Alex Haun was tried and hanged at a gallows just north of Knoxville on December 10. Jacob Harmon and his son, Henry, were both hanged on December 17. Harrison Self was tried, convicted and sentenced to hang, but was released hours before his execution after his daughter, Elizabeth, obtained a last-minute pardon from President Jefferson Davis. Following Benjamin's order, Unionists not directly involved in the conspiracy were imprisoned in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Several died there, including Samuel Pickens, Montgomery Thornburgh, and Levi Trewhitt. In all, more than 150 people were arrested and jailed on suspicion of supporting the bridge burnings or inciting other acts of Union violence in East Tennessee. =Brownlow's involvement= Confederate authorities immediately suspected William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, the radical pro-Union editor of the Knoxville Whig, of engineering the bridge burnings. Brownlow had written in a May 1861 editorial, \\"let the railroad on which Union citizens of East Tennessee are conveyed to Montgomery in irons be eternally and hopelessly destroyed,\\" and had suspiciously gone into hiding in Sevier County just two weeks before the attacks. Brownlow denied any involvement, however, and in a letter to William H. Carroll condemned the attacks. Lacking evidence of Brownlow's complicity, and wanting to be rid of his agitations, Confederate authorities offered him safe passage to the northern states. District Attorney Ramsey, whose prominent Knoxville family had been on the receiving end of Brownlow's abusive harangues for nearly two decades, remained convinced of Brownlow's involvement. In spite of the Confederate government's promise of safe passage, Ramsey had Brownlow jailed after he had arrived back in Knoxville. Incarcerated with many of the bridge burners, Brownlow kept a daily journal in which he recorded several eyewitness accounts of the arrests, imprisonment, and executions of many of the conspirators. =Later actions of the bridge burners= A Union sentry guards the bridge at Strawberry Plains, ca. 1864 In the weeks following the bridge burnings, William Carter returned to Kentucky to continue to pressure Union commanders to invade East Tennessee. William Pickens, Daniel Stover, and Alfred Cate all fled to Kentucky and enlisted in the Union Army. David Fry was captured in Georgia in the spring of 1862 and ordered to hang, but he managed to escape. Union forces under Ambrose Burnside finally invaded East Tennessee in mid-1863, and entered Knoxville unopposed in September of that year. After his release in early 1862, Brownlow published his prison journal in his book, Sketches of the Rise, Progress and Decline of Secession. Aimed at northern readers, the book's chapter on the bridge burners focuses on alleged atrocities committed by Confederate soldiers and politicians, and includes several engravings depicting the executions and last moments of some of the condemned conspirators. Following his return to Knoxville on the heels of Burnside's invasion in 1863, Brownlow vengefully pursued all who had prosecuted the bridge burners.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), pp. 180-200. Legacy Pottertown Bridge Burners memorial near Mosheim, dedicated to the Lick Creek bridge burners Having sworn an oath of secrecy, William Carter never revealed the names of anyone involved in the bridge-burning conspiracy, not even after the war had been over for decades. As a result, many of the conspirators are still unknown. In 1871, the names of the southeastern Tennessee conspirators were made public when their leader, Alfred Cate, petitioned Congress for compensation for their actions. Oliver Perry Temple uncovered still more names through correspondence with known conspirators as he collected information for his book, East Tennessee and the Civil War, in the 1890s. Along with the detailed account in Temple's book, several accounts of the bridge burnings have been published. In 1862, Radford Gatlin, a Confederate who had been chased out of his largely pro-Union namesake mountain town, published a glorified account of James Keeling's actions at the Strawberry Plains bridge. Union supporters Thomas William Humes and William Rule, who were both in Knoxville when the bridges were burned, included brief accounts of the conspiracy in their respective works on the war in the late 1880s.Thomas William Humes, The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: Ogden Brothers and Company, 1888), pp. 133-137.William Rule, The Loyalists of Tennessee in the Late War (Cincinnati: H.C. Sherick and Company, 1887), pp. 9-12. Novelist William E. Barton published a fictional version of the bridge- burning conspiracy in the late 1890s. More recently, in 1995, Cameron Judd published an historical novel about the incident, entitled The Bridge Burners. In 1996, Donahue Bible, a Greene County native and historian, published a book about the Lick Creek bridge burners entitled, Broken Vessels: The Story of the Hanging of the Pottertown Bridge Burners.\\"'Bridge Burners' Tour Attracts 85 East Tennesseans,\\" Greeneville Sun, 1 November 1999.

Under the British flag she captured a Spanish privateer larger and better-armed than herself. She also served at the captures of the islands of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, St. Croix, Tobago, and St. Lucia, and of Surinam. She served at Antigua as a guard ship but was wrecked in 1811. She was then salved and sold. Privateer Captain Charles Penrose of the third rate captured Guachapin in the Leeward Islands.Marshall (1828), Supplement 2, pp.461-2. The London Gazette reports that on 9 April 1800, Sans Pareil captured the Spanish letter of marque trader Guakerpin, of 165 tons burthen (bm), ten guns and 38 men. She belonged to Saint Andero, and was sailing from there to Vera Cruz with a cargo of iron, porter, and linens. The British took her into service and commissioned her in February 1801 under Commander Samuel Butcher. British warship Between 15 March and 7 April 1801, an expedition under Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge and Admiral Duckworth captured the islands of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, and St. Croix. Guachupin [sic] was listed among the vessels participating in the expedition and entitled to a share in the \\"proceeds of sundry articles of provisions, merchandise, stores, and property afloat\\" that had been captured. Guachapins greatest moment of glory came later that year on 18 August 1801. On that day was between Martinique and St. Lucia when she saw the Guachapin in an unequal fight against a Spanish letter of marque armed with 18 brass guns - 32 and 12-pounders. Heureux sailed up as fast as she could but even before she arrived the Spaniard had struck to Guachapin. The two-hour engagement had cost Guachapin three men killed and three wounded, and the Spaniard nearly the same. The Spaniard was the Theresa, under the command of an officer of the Spanish Navy, and had a crew of 120 men. In April 1802 Commander Kenneth Mackenzie (or M'Kenzie) took command. In 1803, after the recommencement of hostilities with France, Guachapin participated in the captures of Tobago and St. Lucia.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.899. In September 1803, Guachupin [sic] captured three prizes. On 2 September she was in company with when they captured two vessels whose names they did not record: *A sloop carrying a cargo of coffee, sugar, and the like *A schooner in ballast. Then on 24 September Guachapin captured the Spanish ship Industria, which was carrying 220 slaves (French property). On 25 January 1804, Saint Lucia captured the French privateers Furet and Bijou. Bijou, had captured two prizes, one of which was the brig Good Intent, which had been sailing from Barbados to Demarara, and which Guachapin had already retaken. A few months later, Guachapin assisted Commodore Sir Samuel Hood's squadron at the capture of Surinam River in 1804. The squadron consisted of Hood's flagship, the 74-gun third rate , , , , , Drake, the 10-gun schooner , and transports carrying 2000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. On 24 April, Hippomenes, under Commander Conway Shipley, escorted a convoy carrying a division of the army under Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland to land at Warappa creek to collect enough boats from the plantations to transport troops to the rear of Fort New Amsterdam. On 30 April, Mackenzie, unable to sail closer, left Guachapin 50 leagues to leeward and brought up all her boats, together with 50 crewmen. He then assisted Shipley in superintending the landing of Maitland's troops at Warappa. The Dutch governor initially rejected the surrender terms but surrendered on 5 May after the British captured the battery of Friderici. The officers and men from Guachapin who had served ashore during the capture of Suriname were among those that shared in the prize money from the campaign. In June 1804 Commander Robert Henderson replaced Mackenzie, who had transferred to take command of the newly-captured in May, and then in June. Then on 13 September 1806, Guachapin became a guardship at St. Johns, Antigua. In 1807 she was under Acting Lieutenant Uriah Goodwin. In 1810, William Fletcher was promoted to lieutenant to command her. Fate At some point Lieutenant Michael Jenkins took command. On 29 July 1811, a hurricane drove Guachapin on shore at Rat Island, Antigua, where she was bilged. Jenkins and his crew were all saved, as were most of the stores. Later the British recovered the brig. Rather than recommission her they sold her in Jamaica.

The United Officers' Group (Spanish, Grupo de Oficiales Unidos) or GOU was a nationalist secret society within the Argentine Army which staged a coup d'état in 1943 to overthrow President Ramón Castillo, thus ending the Infamous Decade and forming a military junta which lasted until 1945. Arturo Rawson was made President, but was only in office for a few days before the GOU replaced him with Pedro Pablo Ramírez. History The GOU started to operate somewhere in the beginning of the 1940s, after the time Colonel Juan Perón returned from Europe. In his book Yo, Juan Domingo Perón, Perón described that the people that would be part of the GOU shared his ideas about the promotion of trade unions and labor rights, and wanted to prevent further acts of electoral fraud by the Infamous Decade. However, Perón was concerned in that the group would be aiming to make a mere coup d'état, without planning in advance the social changes they intended to implement.Galasso, p. 139-140 As with most secret societies, secrecy makes historian's work difficult, and the specific details about the internal work of the society are unrecorded, incomplete or contradictory.Galasso, p. 142 One of those details is the creation of the GOU: according to a report by Domingo Mercante, the GOU was created by him and Perón, between the end of 1942 and May 1943,Galasso, p. 141 while Juan Carlos Montes claimed to be the creator with Urbano de La Vega. Both former members of the GOU did not point any specific ideology as the point in common between members, but the need to unite the officers opposed to Agustín Pedro Justo. Members The original members of the GOU were 19 officials, without a chief. Other members joined later. The recorded list of original members is as follows, in the original order: # Domingo Mercante # Severo Eizaguirre # Raúl Pízzales # León Bengoa # Francisco Filippi # Juan Carlos Montes # Julio A. Lagos # Mario Villagrán # Fernando González # Eduardo Arias Duval # Agustín de la Vega # Arturo Saavedra # Bernardo Guillentegui # Héctor Ladvocat # Bernardo Menéndez # Urbano de la Vega Aguirre # Enrique P. González # Emilio Ramírez # Juan Domingo Perón The officials that joined the GOU afterwards are as follows # Eduardo Jorge Avalos # Aristóbulo Mittelbach # Alfredo A. Baisi # Oscar Uriondo # Tomás Ducó # Heraclio Ferrazano # Alfredo Arguero Fragueyro Pedro Pablo Ramírez, became President of Argentina in 1943 by the GOU's intervention. Presidents Arturo Rawson, Pedro Pablo Ramírez and Edelmiro Farrell had close ties to the GOU, but were not members themselves. Nature of the GOU Little information exists about the GOU. Felipe Pigna suggests that GOU members were nationalist sympathisers of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy,Felipe Pigna, Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3, ed. Planeta, 2006 (reed.2007), p. 304 but Noberto Galasso argues that there is no conclusive evidence for that in documents, reports or confirmed events.Galasso, p. 144-145 Silvano Santander wrote the book Técnica de una traición () with documents that would prove that Juan Domingo Perón and Eva Perón were agents of Nazism. Uruguayan Eduardo Víctor Haedo was accused as well, which motivated an investigation by the Uruguayan Congress: it turned out that the documents used were forged.Galasso, p. 145 There is also a resolution supporting Adolf Hitler, but it is considered another forgery: none of the members of the GOU acknowledged it, and it was unsigned, whereas all GOU resolutions were signed. On a general level, the military of Argentina was influenced by the German military, but this influence was dated from decades before the rise of Nazism. This influence was also limited to the military topics, and did not include the ideas of political organization.Galasso, p. 148 Bibliography * References Category:Anti-communism in Argentina Category:Far-right politics in Argentina Category:History of Argentina (1943–1955) Category:Infamous Decade Category:Military history of Argentina Category:Organizations established in the 1940s Category:Secret societies ","title":"United Officers' Group"},{"id":"30489829","text":"Böhler, Bohler, and Boehler is a surname, and may refer to; *Bruce Boehler (1917–1987), American professional basketball player *George Boehler (1892–1958), American professional baseball player *Britta Böhler (born 1960), German lawyer, member of the Dutch Senate for the GreenLeft Party *Fred Bohler (1885–1960), American athlete, coach, and administrator *George Bohler (1887–1968), American football, basketball, and baseball coach *Henry Cabot Lodge Bohler (1925–2007), American airman and civil-rights activist *Jochen Böhler (born 1969), German historian *Lorenz Böhler (1885–1973), Austrian physician *Otto Böhler (1847–1913), Austrian silhouette artist *Peter Böhler (1712–1775,) German Moravian missionary *Reinhard Böhler (1945–1995), German motorcyclist *Roy Bohler, American football, basketball, and baseball coach *Stefanie Böhler (born 1981), German skier See also *Bohler Canyon *Boehlert ","title":"Böhler (surname)"},{"id":"30489847","text":"right Robert Thomas (November 1781 – 1 July 1860) was a Welsh newspaper proprietor, printer and early settler of South Australia who was born on a farm 'Rhantregynwen', at Llanymynech, Powys, Wales.www.adb.anu.edu.au; accessed 2015 In 1836, Thomas migrated to the new colony with his wife Mary and family on the , arriving at Holdfast Bay on 8 November. He printed Governor Hindmarsh's proclamation of the new colony (28 December 1836). On 27 and 28 March 1837 he purchased from the South Australian Company, at auction, numerous plots of land as surveyed by Colonel Light in the new capital: Town Acres Nos. 41 on the north side of Rundle Street; 51, 56, and 58 on the north side of Hindley Street; 82 on the south side of Rundle Street; and in North Adelaide Nos. 729 on Brougham Place, and 891 and 893 on Burton Street. Town Acre No. 56 would be the site of his first printery, where the first issue of the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register was printed on 3 June 1837. By 1838, the Register was a weekly newspaper. He also published the weekly Adelaide Chronicle and South Australian Literary Record (27 May 1840 – 18 May 1842). Thomas also printed copies of the South Australian Church Hymn Book for the Rev. Charles Howard, the Royal South Australian Almanac (1838-1842) and from 1839, the Port Lincoln Herald and South Australian Commercial Advertiser. The Register had a fierce policy of independence and this resulted in conflict with Governor George Gawler, who it often criticised for his economic policies. Gawler was particularly attacked in September 1840 over his ordering of the execution of two Ngarrindjeri men as a reprisal for the killing and dismembering of the survivors of the Maria shipwreck on the Coorong the previous July. As a result, the Government ceased to use the services of Robert Thomas & Co. from 11 November 1840 as Government printer, especially of the Government Gazette – a loss to the company of £1650 a year. After an unsuccessful trip to London to protest the loss of business from the Government, he returned to Adelaide, where he continued to be involved in further printing and publishing. He died on 1 July 1860 at his home in Hindley Street.

The film was directed by Allan Dwan; his third film with John Payne and his third film about the United States Marine Corps, the others being Abroad with Two Yanks (1944) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949). Plot The film tells the story in flashbacks of a bottle of scotch carried by a World War II Marine lieutenant and Korean War captain, Sam MacKenzie. His girl Anne gives it to him in 1942, but tells him to save it for a very special occasion. She asks him to marry her before he ships out to the fighting, but he does not want to risk making her a widow. While on leave in Melbourne, Sam meets Kitty and considers a dalliance, but leaves when he learns she has a husband who may be a Japanese prisoner of war or dead. When he returns to Anne, he is disgusted to find she has acquired a major as an admirer. However, they get things straightened out and marry. During the Korean War, Sam's Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, First Marine Division, is pursuing the fleeing North Korean Army and looking forward to going home. However, Sam is informed by his superior that the Chinese have entered the war, so they will have to conduct a \\"fighting withdrawal\\". Sam is ordered to provide flank protection for the regiment. That night, the Chinese attack in battalion strength and almost overrun the company, but artillery fire drives them back. The retreat over the next few days is a nightmare of ambushes and mounting losses. His last remaining officer, Lieutenant Couzens, is wounded. Finally, the men are too tired to go on, so Sam uses his bottle of scotch ... as incentive for once they rejoin their side. They eventually have to abandon their last few vehicles, but throughout, Sam insists that none of the wounded be left behind, even if they have to carry them. While dealing with an enemy tank, Sam is shot. An American helicopter spots them and is able to evacuate the most seriously wounded, including Sam. The rest, along with the bottle entrusted to them, reach friendly lines under the leadership of Sergeant Ekland. Once they are safe, Ekland offers the men the scotch, but nobody wants to drink it, feeling it has been lucky for them. The bottle is returned to Sam, who is still saving it for an important occasion. Production The film was shot with the cooperation of the United States Marine Corps at the Mountain Warfare Training Center at Pickel Meadows, California that recreated the events of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Allied Artists originally approached the Marine Corps for assistance after the book's initial release. The Corps turned down cooperation with the producers as they felt the film was too close to the recently filmed Retreat, Hell!. Though Allied Artists contemplated rewriting the film to involve the US Army, they shelved the film for a few years, with the Corps cooperating.p.140 Suid, Lawrence H.

Its address is 21 rue Ste-Marie adjacent to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Lacolle Subdivision. A large piece of land surrounds it and a long yard is located on the other side of the tracks. Situated close to the Canada–US border, the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Lacolle played a role as both a railway station and a customs and immigration post for Canadian and American border officers. Today the building is abandoned, but acquisition of the station from Canadian Pacific Railway is almost complete as of October 2011 by the municipality of Lacolle. The municipality is planning for the restoration of the station by 2014 at an estimated cost of 1 million dollars. The station is planned to be a municipal museum; the historical society would also have space for a conference room (as told by local newspapers and the mayor of Lacolle).  History  In 1881, the Napierville Junction Railway was created to build a line from Rouses Point, New York to Montreal, Quebec. Construction involved the most direct route to Montreal with minimal grades possible. After the line was completed Lacolle had already built a wooden railway station (construction date never found) that was later ravaged by flames in 1929. In 1907, the Napierville Junction Railway was purchased by the Delaware & Hudson Company, hence the D&H;'s architecture/style of the station. On April 9, 1907, the Napierville Junction Railway was opened from Delson, QC to the US-Canada border, giving the Delaware & Hudson a link to the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway. The Napierville Junction was given the same track that the D&H;'s subsidiary company, the New York & Canada Railroad had built the year before from the border to Rouses Point. Its length was approximately 1.1 miles. As soon as the track was placed, the D&H; used this route, and a small stretch of the Grand Trunk track, to get to Montreal. This route did not last long, however. On October 1, 1917, the D&H; began using CPR tracks out of Delson to reach Montreal. There was also another route used from Canada Junction, just north of Plattsburgh to Montreal. Construction started on Lacolle railway station on July 15, 1930 and was completed on November 15, 1930. The cost of construction was C$38,718.30 in 1930 ($513,096.30 in 2011 Dollars) and it was built by the Delaware & Hudson Railway. The station was inaugurated two days later on November 17, 1930. The building housed customs offices, maintenance equipment and brokers. It was mainly used for passenger service until the 1980s. For over 53 years, the Napierville Junction had its own identity until 1970 when the Delaware & Hudson/Canadian Pacific railway merged it into its own Montreal Division. Lacolle was the epicenter of the Napierville Junction, even in the years after the D&H; merger. The large station hosted passengers for the Montreal Limited and the Adirondack. There were offices and rooms for officials, train conductors and maintenance crews alike. In 1991 the Canadian Pacific Railway bought the Napierville Junction Railway to own the stretch of track from Delson Jct. to Rouses Point. The Delaware and Hudson operates and is wholly owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Due to the renovations, CPR closed down the station and abandoned the property in 1998. Employees working at the station were mostly relocated to work at the Canadian Pacific yards in Montreal.  Architecture  Built by the Napierville Junction Railway, a subsidiary of the American-owned Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Lacolle railway station illustrates the effect of international investment on railway construction in Canada. Lacolle station is a late example of the Château-style developed by railway companies during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Designed by Montreal architect Charles Reginald Tetley, its resemblance to a Normandy manor house reflects the romantic view of its American owners towards the architecture of Old Quebec, and their desire to signify to American travelers that they had arrived in a francophone province. The station retains its relationship with a stone wall of similar masonry which defines the station property. The station serves as a landmark in the community. The cobblestone was carried in from the other side of the Richelieu River on farm land in Noyan, QC. The building was built in an L shape from a top view and the roof is made of copper sheeting. In 1991 Parks Canada listed the Lacolle Station as one of only 54 stations in Canada to be officially preserved.

It was released in Japanese cinemas on 8 December 2007. It is based on a true story in the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake. This story has frequently been reported in the media and has also made into a book. Plot On the way back home, Ryota and his sister Aya met an abandoned Shiba Inu. At first reluctant to adopt it because their father hates dogs, they eventually brought it home secretly because the dog kept on following them home. In order to officially keep the dog at home, Aya told her grandfather that she wanted that dog for her birthday present. Since he promised to give her anything she wants for her birthday, he reluctantly agreed. This initially led to a quarrel between him and his son. Meanwhile, his son, is considering moving to Nagaoka city from Yamakoshi, their village, reduce the time needed for his father to reach the hospital and for the children to live near their school, despite opposition from his father. Aya subsequently names the dog Mari, and it becomes a part of the family. A year later, Mari gave birth to three puppies. That spring, animals behaved strangely, foreshadowing something major to come. On 23 October 2004, a major earthquake, which later became known as the Chūetsu earthquake struck and devastated the whole village. At that time, only grandfather and Aya were at home, and they were pinned down by a wardrobe that collapsed onto them. Mari quickly moved her puppies to a safe place before trying to help the two of them in the house. Meanwhile, Ryota, who was in school, and his father were safe. They immediately went to the emergency shelter, where they heard that Yamakoshi became isolated after the earthquake, thereby making it hard for rescuers. Subsequently, rescuers from the Japan Self-Defense Forces started combing the village and evacuating people by helicopter. Mari noticed two such rescuers and eventually led them to Aya and her grandfather. Thanks to Mari, the two of them were successfully extracted from the wreckage. Her grandfather had lost a lot of blood, and therefore the pair was evacuated by air. However, just when Aya was about to be evacuated, she asked that Mari be evacuated along as well. Her rescuer reluctantly refuses this request, and seeing her pain at being separated from the dog, he felt extremely bad. He even apologizes to her when they met again at the emergency shelter. Without its owner, Mari tries all ways and means to protect her puppies and feed them properly. It also waited patiently for the return of its owner. One day, Aya read in a newspaper that torrential rain would soon flood Yamakoshi and became worried about Mari. She convinces Ryota to sneak into the disaster zone in order to rescue Mari. Together they sneaked off into the devastated village, but they have difficulties navigating through the debris there. To make things worse, they also had to contend with aftershocks and the heavy rain. In this treacherous terrain, Aya cuts her foot, making it painful for her to carry on. She later runs a high fever, and Ryota panics, unsure of what to do in this situation. Luckily, someone who had seen them leaving the shelter had told their father of their whereabouts, and their father managed to find them after a long search. After this incident, Aya did not mention about Mari anymore. When the aftershocks subsided, each family was able to send one representative to go into the village to survey the damage and to collect personal items. Since everyone at the shelter had heard the story of Mari, some people forgo their places to let Ryota and Aya search for Mari again. After a long search, there was no sign that Mari or its three puppies were alive. Just when they were about to give up, a puppy appears, followed by the rest of the dogs. The family happily took back the dogs to the shelter amid applause from the villagers. In 2005, the family moved into a temporary shelter and life for them more or less returns to normal. Mari also lives there with her three puppies. Cast * Eiichiro Funakoshi as Yuichi Ishikawa, an employee of the city hall of Yamakoshi, and the father of Ryota and Aya.

Thomas, 532 U.S. 774 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case brought to the court concerned the extent of the Court's earlier decision in New York v. Belton, concerning whether a person was in custody, a determination central to allowing evidence seized in an automobile search to be presented in trial. However, the Court unanimously dismissed the case because the decision of the Florida state courts was not \\"final\\". Background In Polk County, Florida, police officers went to Robert Thomas' home, investigating possible marijuana sales at his Florida home. While this was going on, Thomas drove up to his house in his car. An officer asked him for his name and identification. Thomas was arrested thereafter when a search on his license showed an outstanding warrant. One officer proceeded to take him inside the house while another searched his car, finding methamphetamine. He was indicted for possession. At his trial, he moved to suppress the evidence, which was subsequently granted by the trial judge. In reversing, an intermediate appellate court found the search valid under New York v. Belton. In Belton, the U.S. Supreme Court established a \\"bright-line\\" rule permitting an officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of a car's occupant to search the car's passenger compartment as an incident of the arrest. In reversing the intermediate court of appeals, the Florida Supreme Court held Belton did not apply because it is limited to situations where the officer initiates contact with a vehicle's occupant while that person remains in the vehicle. The Supreme Court granted review. It would only be a few months before the ultimate decision, where they would dismiss the case. Opinion of the Court In a unanimous opinion authored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Court dismissed the writ of certiorari for want of jurisdiction. Rehnquist wrote that the Florida Supreme Court's decision did not fit any of the categories where the Court \\"treated state- court judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes although there were further proceedings to take place in the state court.\\" Thus, the Court concluded that the Florida Supreme Court's decision was not final. This was partly based on a doctrine from the Cox decision which decided that certain decisions were not 'final' when the trial proceedings had not been completed.420 U.S. at 478.

Going Out in Style traces the journey of Larkin, whether it's the Irish immigrant's first person account of his own wake or the band's in depth interpretation of his life and lineage throughout the album's lyrics. According to bassist/vocalist, Ken Casey, \\"Cornelius has passed on to the other side, and the album becomes a retrospective of his life.\\" The liner notes for the album will feature an obituary for Larkin written by author Michael Patrick MacDonald. The band says that the story of Larkin evolved into a saga which will eventually be told through their website and could eventually become a book someday. Going Out In Style signals the beginning of another chapter in Dropkick Murphys' own story. Vocalist Al Barr said, \\"I hope fans can listen to Going Out In Style with the same excitement we have. It’s all about family and friends for us. No bullshit here… we don’t like to convolute things.\\" The album delves deeper into Irish folk than their previous albums. \\"Broken Hymns\\", \\"Cruel\\" and \\"1953\\" all feature very Irish sounds and themes, dealing with immigration to the United States. A few of the songs break from the concept of the album. \\"The Hardest Mile\\" pays tribute to a group of 57 Irish immigrants, who were hired by railroad contractor Philip Duffy to lay a section of tracks for the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad in a valley now known as Duffy’s Cut (located about 30 miles west of Philadelphia) and disappeared under mysterious circumstances in August 1832.

Academic career Born in Eccles, Lancashire, Donaldson's family moved to Gillingham, Kent, when he was only 18 months old. Following education at the local grammar school he gained a scholarship to read philosophy, politics and economics at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1957 he became a junior lecturer at the University of Leeds, before moving to the University of Leicester in 1960. In 1964 he took up a position at Osmania University in Hyderabad, India, where he stayed until 1967, except for a six-month stint back in the United Kingdom at Ruskin College in 1965. On completing his term in Hyderabad he returned to Ruskin College full-time and remained on staff there until his retirement in the early 1990s. Publishing and broadcasting career During the course of his early academic career Donaldson became increasingly aware of the limited scope, poor standard, and inaccessibility of economics teaching at school and undergraduate level. In order to provide better teaching material, during his time at Leicester University he began to write what would, in 1965, be published as his first book: Guide to the British Economy. It was this work – which was to be republished in three further editions in 1967, 1971 and 1976 – that established his reputation as a populariser of economics. Soon after its publication the BBC approached Donaldson, and with the corporation he devised and presented Managing the Economy on BBC Radio 4 during the latter part of the 1960s. Donaldson's time in India had stirred an interest in development economics, and this was reflected in his follow-up program Affluence and Inequality which aired during the early 1970s, also on Radio 4. The series was accompanied by a book, Worlds Apart, which was based on the program and dealt with similar subject matter. A number of further educational and popular books appeared during the late 1970s and early 1980s, before Donaldson returned to broadcasting with Yorkshire Television-produced programs for ITV Schools and the newly launched Channel 4 television station. His shows 10 x Economics and A Question of Economics were popular with both the general public and teachers, and were widely used in economics classrooms. Both were accompanied by books of the same name.

As result, water rights generate conflict (for example, see Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States), with many water lawyers in the state. Dillon Reservoir in Summit County, part of the Denver Water Board History Water in the American Southwest has always been a scarce commodity and in the 12,000 year since the Clovis people dug the first water wells in the region water has continued to be a topic of concern. The state of Colorado is a headwater state, which means that many rivers in the western and midwestern United States originate in Colorado. The Platte River, the Arkansas River, the Rio Grande River and the Colorado River all have their headwaters in Colorado. Colorado's use of these waters has an effect on users downstream. Prior to the creation of the Territory of Colorado in 1861, few laws existed that pertained specifically to the issue of water rights in the area. When settlers and pioneers first came the area that would encompass Colorado, the common system in the eastern United States for dealing with water was known as riparian water rights. Under this system anyone owning the land through which water ran could use a reasonable amount of water for any purpose as long as it continued downstream and was available for the next land owner. While this system worked well in the east where water was abundant, in the west water was harder to come by. Farmers and miners required large amounts of water for their professions and began to dig 'ditches' or canals to divert water to more convenient locations. This system was known as prior-appropriation water rights, where a certain amount of water could be diverted for 'beneficial use,' and these water rights could be sold or transferred separately from the land. The appropriation doctrine was officially adopted in Colorado in 1872 and within 20 years the so-called Colorado Doctrine had been adopted, in whole or part, by most of the states in the Western United States that had an arid climate. At the end of the 19th century many water systems were over- appropriated. Alternating years of droughts and floods created havoc for land owners and rights holders down stream. In 1902 Kansas took Colorado to the Supreme Court over the water usage of the Arkansas River. The federal government weighed in on the case and the Supreme Court ruled that the states and federal government share jurisdiction and each must be treated fairly. Seven states in the region, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona and California, came together as the League of the Southwest to promote development of the Colorado River. But as more conflicts arose over water rights more lawsuits were filed. In 1922 Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, brought representatives from the seven states to Washington, D.C. to negotiate an interstate treaty. This commission, the brainchild of Delphus E. Carpenter, resulted in the Colorado River Compact. The compact allocated water to each of the states, allowing agricultural irrigation, urban development, and large projects such as the Hoover Dam and Lake Powell. More compacts covering other river basins soon followed. Management The central state office is the Colorado Division of Water Resources. The Colorado Water Conservation Board also has an important role. Supply Colorado is known as the \\"Headwaters State\\" because several of the West's most important rivers rise in its Rocky Mountains. Colorado has eight major river basins and several aquifers. The majority of the water supply falls as snow in the Rocky Mountains. The continental divide traverses the state, causing snowmelt-filled rivers to flow toward the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the divide and the Atlantic Ocean on the east side. Because of weather patterns, more snow falls on the west side, providing more water there. However, most of the state's population is on the east side. Transmountain diversions have solved some of this disparity. The Colorado-Big Thompson Project brings water from the Colorado River Basin to the Front Range of Colorado, primarily in the northeastern corner of the state. The Fryingpan-Arkansas Project brings water from the Fryingpan River Basin to the southeastern corner. Though originally designed primarily for agricultural water supply, both projects have been increasingly supplying Colorado's growing municipalities. Demands =In- state= Various in-state interests make demands on Colorado's scarce water resources, including: * Agriculture * Environmentalists * Industry * Colorado's citizens Denver Water (government agency) is the largest municipal supplier in the state. It relies on multiple watersheds on both sides of the divide. Mountain Mutual Reservoir Company and North Fork Associates (founded by the brothers Ronald and William Blatchley) are the largest private supplier of ground and surface water rights, prior-appropriation and senior water rights, and water engineering services in Colorado. In-state demands also come from: * The ski industry * White-water rafting companies =Out-of-state interests= Because of river compacts, Colorado doesn't control all the water originating within its borders, and out-of-state players have their own interests, particularly of the \\"big four\\" Colorado rivers which arise within the state: * Arkansas River * Colorado River * South Platte River * Rio Grande Publications * Colorado Water * Water Law Review * Headwaters Magazine See also * Colorado River Compact * Colorado Water Courts * Colorado Water Quality Control Division * Water scarcity References External links * Colorado Division of Water Resources, official site * Colorado Foundation for Water Education, official site * Colorado Water Conservation Board, a state site * Colorado Water Institute (CWI), an affiliate of Colorado State University * Water Resources Archive at Colorado State University * Colorado Water Law, University of Denver, Sturm College of Law, LibGuide * Colorado's Surface Water Conditions, a state site * USGS site * Water Law Research Guide, from the Georgetown Law Library * North Fork Associates, official Site, buy water Colorado * Mountain Mutual Reservoir Company, official Site, water augmentation ","title":"Water in Colorado"},{"id":"30490110","text":"Peter Tom was an Associate Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department from 1994 to 2019.Official Biography  Education  Tom is a 1975 graduate of Brooklyn Law School.

(New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.351. The eclectic architecture is a mix of Baroque Romanesque styles, an experiment not uncommon in the Victorian era. When originally built, the church had a 250-foot (76.2 m) Baroque tower, but in the 1913 renovation supervised by architect Paul Schulz, the tower was simplified and shortened. The AIA Guide to New York City calls the church \\"a powerful, deeply modeled, limestone pile, one of the tallest structures (except the \\"projects\\") in the community\\" and dates the church to the 1870s. The church was once the most important in Manhattan's \\"Little Germany\\" and was often referred to as the \\"German Catholic Cathedral\\" of New York by the German Catholic community. This parish grew out of the first German Catholic parish in New York City, St. Nicholas' Church, which has since been closed and demolished. The grandiosity of this church is synonymous with the importance of the German Catholic community in the middle of the nineteenth century in New York City. At that time, German Catholics were the second largest Catholic group in the city after the Irish Catholic community. Most Holy Redeemer originally had a primary school run by the School Sisters of Notre Dame which taught its students entirely in the German language for most of the nineteenth century.Dolan, Jay P.

The band has since released six albums, three live albums and one DVD. Wild Dogs rose to local and regional recognition in the 1980s as a pioneer of metal in the Pacific Northwest, followed by international recognition after the release of their second album. Wild Dogs has experienced numerous line-up changes. McCourt is the only original and constant member of the band. Several attempts to reunite most of the original band members have failed, most recently in July 2010. McCourt has kept the band active for over 30 years, playing local and regional shows and international festivals with various band members. He continues to reproduce CDs and do interviews for fanzines and radio stations. History =Early days (1981-1983)= In the summer of 1981, Jeff Mark, Mick Zane, Pete Holmes and Matt McCourt teamed up to perform in Portland as the Ravers, promoting McCourt's release of \\"I Was a Teenage Rock 'n' Roller\\" on Matchbox Records. Guitarist Mark, drummer Holmes, vocalist McCourt and bassist Danny Kurth were asked to record a few songs for a recording class at Recording Associates. The first session produced \\"Fugitive of the Law\\", which also featured local guitarist Kip Doran. The second session produced \\"We Got the Power,\\" \\"Runnin Away,\\" and \\"Tonight We Rock.\\" The third session proved to be the turning point. Drummer Pete Holmes was lured away by the band Black 'n Blue and was replaced by Black n Blue frontman Jaime St. James. The next session yielded \\"The Tonight Show,\\" \\"Life is a Game,\\" \\"I Need a Love to Call My Own,\\" \\"Two Wrongs,\\" and the song included on a local FM radio station (KGON) compilation album, \\"Born to Rock.\\" McCourt saw a one time news segment on the new Music Television cable channel (MTV) about Shrapnel label president Mike Varney, who was searching for unsung guitar heroes. Jeff Mark was known as one of the most notable guitarists in Portland. McCourt sent Varney a demo of their recording sessions with Recording Associates. Varney offered an appearance on his compilation series. The band originally named themselves DMZ, but changed it to Wild Dogs after being inspired by two old hound dogs that the band passed daily, on the stairwell at their practice studio. After the release of US Metal Vol 2, the response and demand for Wild Dogs increased, evidenced by local and international fan mail, and interview requests by fanzines. McCourt suggested to Shrapnel that they take the band with the best response and produce an album. Varney suggested Wild Dogs, since there was most of an album recorded. However, Jaime St. James left the band to join Black n Blue in Hollywood, so the band was left with the task of finding a drummer. McCourt placed ads in the local newspaper, managed to get airplay on a local radio station and persisted at getting the demo played at local clubs during band breaks. McCourt recruited local whiz kid, 16-year-old drummer Deen Castronovo to join the band. The first album was released and the band had its first gig on August 20, 1982 in San Francisco at The Stone, with Culprit and Varney's band Cinema, leading to another MTV news segment. The following week the band played in Seattle, sharing the bill with TKO, Rail, Atom Bomb and Myth (Queensrÿche). They later toured with Slayer, Metal Church, Anthrax, Dio, Raven and Girlschool. Wild Dogs became known for their live show. With McCourt's use of spiked baseball bats, blow up dolls and other props, and Castronovo's twirling and stick juggling showmanship, the band earned its wild, bad boy reputation.

Nasrid–Ottoman relations occurred during the last years of the 15th century, as the Nasrid dynasty attempted to obtain the help of the Ottoman Empire against the Reconquista in Spain. Context The Ottomans had been extending into the western Mediterranean recently, especially with the Ottoman invasion of Otranto in Italy in 1480-81, interrupted by the death of Sultan Mehmed II.Mark D. Meyerson (1991) The Muslims of Valencia in the Age of Fernando and Isabel; pp. 64ff This Turkish expansion represented an increased threat to the Spanish Crown under Fernando, which had to deal with a Muslim presence in southern Spain, with the Kingdom of Córdoba. This encouraged Spain to deal with the Mudéjars in a more severe manner, by disarming them, and prohibiting their access to fortresses. The Turks continued their forays into the western Mediterranean. There were rumors of the coming of Turkish fleet in 1484-1484, and they attacked Malta in 1488. Fernando reinforced the defenses of Sicily as a response, and even made a temporary alliance with the Mamluks against the Ottomans from 1488 until 1491, shipping wheat and offering a fleet of 50 caravels against the Ottomans. Diplomatic mission and fleet action Boabdil, requested Ottoman and Mamluk help against Spain In 1487, the Nasrids of Granada had sent envoys to the Ottomans, and also to the Mamluks, in order to obtain help against the Spanish offensive.P. M. Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton & Bernard Lewis (1970) The Cambridge History of Islam; p. 312 One envoy to the Mamluks seems to have been sent, in the person of the Granadan Ibn al-Azraq.Leonard Patrick Harvey Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1614; p. 335 Two envoys were sent to the Ottoman Empire, one from Xàtiva, and a certain Pacoret from Paterna. =Naval intervention= The co-advisor of Boabdil Muhammad Ibn Edin made plans for Ottoman troops to be disembarked in Valencia, from where they would join 200,000 Mudéjars against the Spanish. Bayezit II was however much too busy in the east, especially with the Ottoman–Mamluk War going on, to lend any major support. As a response to the Nasrid plea, however, Bayezit II sent the Ottoman admiral Kemal Reis with a fleet to the west Mediterranean. This was the first Ottoman involvement in the Western Mediterranean.Donald Edgar Pitcher (1968) An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire; p. 99 He is thought to have made contact with Muslims of Granada on the coast of Spain. Until 1495, Kemal Reis was active in raiding the Spanish coast, his fleet being based in Bône, Bougie and Jerba. Kemal also ferried numerous Muslim refugees from the coast of Spain to Northern Africa. Kemal Reis was then recalled by Bayezit in 1495. Granada would finally fall to the Spanish in 1492, with the Battle of Granada. The Mudéjars would continue to have contacts with the Ottomans, as in 1502. Boabdil would emigrate to North Africa with 6,000 other Muslims in 1493.Jamil M. Abun-Nasr (1987) A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period; p. 146 =Reception of refugees= Numerous refugees from the Nasrid kingdom of Granada were allowed by the Ottomans to settle as refugees in the Ottoman Empire. Among them was the Jew Moses Hamon, who became a famous doctor at the Ottoman court.Miri Shefer Mossensohn (1971) Ottoman Medicine: healing and medical institutions, 1500-1700; p. 40 Bayezid II sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed. He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He criticized the conduct of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. \\"You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler\\", he said to his courtiers — \\"he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!\\".Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler (1912) The Jewish Encyclopedia: a descriptive record of the history, religion, literature, and customs of the Jewish people from the earliest times to the present day, Vol. 2.

United Int'l Holdings, Inc., 532 U.S. 588 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned a provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 dealing with manipulating and evading rules set by the SEC. The Court concluded that a secret understanding to violate an arrangement under the Act still constituted a violation, rejecting an argument that oral contracts were categorically excluded from the provision's coverage. Background In return for United International Holdings, Inc.'s assistance in preparing its application, contracts, system, and financing for a cable television system in Hong Kong, Wharf Holdings Ltd. orally granted United an option to buy 10% of stock in the system. The agreement was never written down. Ultimately, Wharf refused to allow United to exercise its option. United then sued Wharf in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that Wharf violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits using \\"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance...in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\\"415 U.S.C. § 78j(b) Wharf's internal documents, which suggested that Wharf never intended to carry out its promise, supported United's claim. A jury found in United Holdings' favor, finding a violation of the 1934 Act. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. Opinion of the Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the unanimous decision of the Court, which affirmed the Tenth Circuit. The Court held that an oral agreement to give an option to buy stock while secretly intending never to honor that option violates the Securities Exchange Act of 1934's prohibition of deceptive devices. Justice Breyer wrote for the Court that there was no \\"convincing reason to interpret the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it applies to 'any contract' for the purchase or sale of a security.\\" Under this reasoning, the Tenth Circuit was correct in affirming the jury's verdict, and Wharf Limited was found to have violated the 1934 Act.

It is an Anglo-Catholic Episcopal parish noteworthy for its historically significant architecture and decor, which took shape in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Kirchmayer's rood beam, 1913 The Church of the Saviour was first organized in Syracuse, New York in 1848 as St. James Church. It was only the second church established in the state of New York to have entirely free pews. After a series of fires, the building was replaced in 1891 with one designed by Syracuse architect Asa L. Merrick. Seven years later, after a bankruptcy auction, the parish was reorganized as the Church of the Saviour. Finally, after yet another fire, in 1912, the building interior was redesigned by the firm of Ralph Adams Cram, one the country's leading exponents of Gothic Revival architecture and proponent of Anglo- Catholic worship. The interior of the Church of the Saviour features a rood beam carved in 1913 by Johannes Kirchmayer of Boston; an altar of Caen stone and Carrara marble, by the firm of J. and R. Lamb, dedicated in 1915; and a 2,000-pipe organ built by the M. P. Möller Company in 1962. The organ was built according to an unusual design created by the musicologist Ernest F. White, the Möller Company's tonal director, who also served as the Church of the Saviour's organist and musical director in 1962-1963. The building also contains a lady chapel and a wooden columbarium. Sunday Eucharistic services at the Church of the Saviour are conducted according to rite I of the Book of Common Prayer, the form of the liturgy used in Episcopal churches in the United States before 1979.

In the early 1940s, the airport was transferred to Shiawassee County, later to the city of Owosso. The airport was officially named the Owosso City Airport in June 1949. The first jet to land at Owosso Airport was a two engine Learjet from Omaha, Nebraska in 1966. The City of Owosso deeded the airport over to the Shiawassee Airport Board in July 1982.

The episode's storyline followed Nazi scientist Alfred Hoffman (Craig Robert Young) as he specially designed airborne toxins to kill only surrounding people with similar genetic traits, such as people with brown eyes. It was written by Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta, and directed by Adam Davidson. Along with Young and a number of small guest parts, the episode featured another guest appearance by Clark Middleton as rare book seller Edward Markham. \\"The Bishop Revival\\" first aired in the United States on January 28, 2010 on the Fox network to an estimated 9.153 million viewers. Critical reception for the episode ranged from positive to mixed, as reviewers were divided on the episode's villain. Plot 15 people suffocate at a Jewish wedding, appearing to have asphyxiated from the inside out. When the Fringe team arrives, Olivia (Anna Torv) identifies that all the victims were from the groom's side, whose grandmother was a Holocaust survivor - and Walter (John Noble) surmises that they were all killed via their shared genetic traits. Later, a similar mass death occurs at a coffee shop, in which Walter recognizes the victims all had brown eyes, another common genetic trait. From fingerprints found at the scene, they discover the culprit is Alfred Hoffman (Craig Robert Young), a Nazi scientist apparently somehow over 100 years old. Walter realizes that the man likely worked with his own father, Robert Bishoff (a German scientist who defected to the US in 1943 and anglicised his name), in creating a chemical agent that, once heated as a gas, could be used to target any specific trait using DNA from the target subject—especially those not of the master race. Though Walter originally had his father's files on the subject, his son Peter (Joshua Jackson), 10 years earlier, had sold them; Peter tries to recover the files but finds some have been used by an artist to create sensationalism art, causing Walter to become distraught. They trace Hoffman to his home, finding his equipment used to create the chemical agent downstairs but no sign of Hoffman. Walter nearly suffocates from an agent left by Hoffman, but Olivia and Peter are able to save him in time. As the FBI search the premises, they find evidence that points to a convention being held to promote world equality. Olivia and Peter depart to try to find Hoffman, while Walter remains behind, examining Hoffman's equipment. At the convention, Hoffman has replaced the heating elements for the chafing dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter has been able to recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together. Production \\"The Bishop Revival\\" was the third episode to be written by writing partners Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta. It was the only Fringe episode directed by Adam Davidson. \\"The Bishop Revival\\" revealed that the seahorse shown in promotions since the series began was in fact a genetically encoded \\"signature\\" created by Walter's father Dr. Robert Bishop. In an interview after the episode's broadcast, consulting producer Akiva Goldsman cited \\"The Bishop Revival\\" when discussing the use of flashbacks in Fringe; he stated his disinclination to use too many flashbacks in the series, explaining \\"I think flashbacks are really useful and there are a couple of places where it will be useful. But fundamentally, no, I don't think we're a show that will be doing a lot of jumping back in time despite the single horde of calls for the 'Walter's Grandfather Nazi Hunting' series. I think not, but it was fun to do [in the 'Peter' episode].\\" Guest stars for the episode included Craig Robert Young, Max Train, Sierra Pitkin, Brendon Zub, Barbara Kottmeier, John Macintyre, Lauren Attadia, Al Miro, Aaron Brooks, Magda Harout, Leonard Tenisci, Alberta Mayne, Nancy Linari, and Dan Joffre. Clark Middleton, who was last seen in the first-season episode \\"Ability\\", made his second guest appearance in \\"The Bishop Revival\\" as rare bookseller Edward Markham. Cultural references The episode contained two pieces of music from the 19th century German composer Johannes Brahms: his Piano Quartet No. 1, Op.25 in G Major: III. Andante Con Moto-Animato and Piano Quartet No. 1, Op.25 in G Minor: II. Intermezzo: Allegro Ma Non Troppo-Trio: Animato. Also in the episode, someone is seen holding a Dharma Initiative tea bag, a reference to the mysterious organization on the science fiction series Lost. The Nazi in this episode appears to be Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel, Heinrich Himmler. Aside from looking like the character, Himmler was also both a Nordicist and a Nazi Occultist.http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/heinrich_himmler.htm At one point in the episode, a scared elderly woman points at him screaming, \\"It's him... it's him...!\\" This has a double meaning, as she could have been saying \\"It's him!\\" or she could have been trying to say \\"It's Himmler!\\" Reception =Ratings= In a Thursday night filled mostly with repeats, Fox's airing of new episodes Bones and Fringe finished #1 among adults aged 18–49, with an estimated 9.153 million viewers tuning in. Fringe was up fifteen percent from the previous week with a 3.0 rating, tying its highest 18–49 ratings share for the season. It was the second most viewed episode of the season after the season premiere \\"A New Day in the Old Town\\". =Reviews= The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think about \\"The Bishop Revival\\", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode \\"surprisingly meh\\"; while appreciating \\"all the weird family revelations about the Bishops\\", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be \\"too much\\" because \\"we didn't need that extra backstory\\". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining \\"Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it.\\" Murray did however praise the killer's methods and \\"Aryan aloofness\\" as \\"cool\\" and \\"delightfully old-school\\". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained \\"stupid revelations\\"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father \\"just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather was supposed to be 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged.\\" Other than a few minor complaints with the episode's logic, IGN writer Ramsey Isler thought positively about \\"The Bishop Revival\\" and the Nazi story element in particular, stating \\"there's a definite unique Fringe flavor that makes this story work\\". Isler disliked the unsolved mystery of Hoffman however, writing the \\"story really had the feel of one of those intriguing but ultimately disposable stories in the Fringe library\\". Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic called the episode \\"amazing\\" and a \\"heart stopper\\", while Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the father-son dynamic. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"The Bishop Revival\\" was \\"one of the series' most satisfying stand-alone episodes\\" because it featured a \\"good threat\\" and gave more information about the Bishop family's backstory. Tucker praised John Noble's performance, as his \\"portrayal of Walter encompasses everything from endearing daffiness to ferocious concentration and commitment\\". MTV's Josh Wigler believed the episode was \\"terrific,\\" but wished there was more of a balance between the show's three leads, and that Olivia was featured on a regular basis. He, Hanson, and other critics agreed that this and the previous week's episode gave Fringe some strong momentum heading into the winter finale. Though normally skeptical of the series' many fringe cases, Popular Mechanics called the episode Fringes \\"most plausible case yet\\". =Awards and nominations= At the 2011 Young Artist Awards, Sierra Pitkin received a nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series under the category \\"Guest Starring Young Actress Ten and Under\\".

He began racing motorcycles in the 1910s, and was very successful though the 1920s, winning the National Sidecar Championship in 1920, the Pikes Peak Hillclimb, and several other Hillclimb Championships. He was involved in motorcycle racing throughout his life, including race promotion and organization. He owned a Harley-Davidson and Excelsior motorcycle dealership in the 1920s in Greeley.https://web.archive.org/web/20100114011758/http://motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=145 Clymer began publishing in his 20s, among other commercial ventures, including advertising his services as an advisor to inventors in the back pages of American Motorcycle Association Magazine. He was convicted of mail fraud, and could have avoided jail time if he admitted wrongdoing and refunded any funds received, but Clymer refused to admit guilt, and thus spent a year in Leavenworth prison as a felon. He was apparently a model prisoner, and was given privileges including conjugal visits with his wife Meryl, and ran his businesses while in prison. https://rurallibrarianwv.blogspot.com/2018/05/who- was-inmate-floyd-clymer-1895-1970.html  Publishing  The Clymer name is best known for his publishing business. His first publication, Motorcycle Topics, was published in the late 1910s, and he resumed publishing magazines and books in earnest after WW2. He published the popular Clymer repair manuals for cars, motorcycles, and powersports vehicles in a standardized format to step-by-step disassembly and reassembly of the complete vehicle, illustrated with photographs. The 'Clymer manual became shorthand among home mechanics as a useful guide to vehicle maintenance and repair. In 2013 the Clymer manual business became part of the Haynes Group, and are still published under the Clymer name. Clymer also published dozens of books on cars and motorcycles, and was among the first to assemble historical surveys of the car and motorcycle industries with his Treasury of Early American Motorcycle, Treasury of Early American Automobile, Those Wonderful Old Automobiles, Henry's Wonderful Model T, and Historical Motor Scrapbooks from the 1950s. He also published an annual yearbook for the Indianapolis 500 from 1946-1968, as well as collections of British car and motorcycle magazine road tests. Clymer purchased Cycle Magazine from Petersen Publishing in July 1957, which had a circulation of several hundred thousand during his tenure through 1966. It was said of Clymer that \\"He never met a motorcycle he didn't like\\", and some criticized Cycle for failing to prompt improvements in motorcycle design through journalistic feedback.  Motorcycle Manufacturer  Clymer attempted to purchase the Indian motorcycle brand in the 1950s, and was successful in buying it in the early 1960s. By 1967 he had begun distribution of Indian- branded minicycles, featuring Jawa, Morini Franco and Morini Minarelli engines and Chassis components using names such as Papoose, Ponybike and Boy Racer. The success of these small machines lead to the design and small-run assembly of the Indian Velo 500 from a mix of British drivetrain components from Velocette, Royal Enfield, and Norton, in a specially commissioned Italian chassis. The Chassises included frames by Italjet, forks by Marzocchi, and wheels by Grimeca. He also sought to promote the Münch motorcycle as an Indian, and commissioned Friedl Münch to create a motorcycle using a sidevalve Indian Chief V-twin motor in a Münch chassis. While his minicycle line would continue, and expand, into the seventies, the realization of these full-sized indian cycles would came to a halt when Floyd Clymer died of a heart attack in 1970, at age 74. https://web.archive.org/web/20100114011758/http://motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=145 See also *Cycle (magazine) *Clymer repair manual *Münch (motorcycles) References External links Floyd Clymer- Hemmings Classic Car Category:1895 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Motoring journalists Category:Motorcycling writers ","title":"Floyd Clymer"},{"id":"30490672","text":"The Monument of Independence is a monument in Vlorë, Albania, dedicated to the Albanian Declaration of Independence and worked by Albanian sculptors, Muntaz Dhrami and Kristaq Rama.

He also appears in an animated movie, Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, and has featured in manga and novels that have not been released in English. His birth name was revealed to be Theodore Bronev in Azran Legacy. Professor Layton is based on the idea of an English gentleman, and is a professor of archaeology at the fictional Gressenheller University in London. He was designed by Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino, who used Sherlock Holmes and fellow video game character Phoenix Wright as inspiration for his creation. He is voiced by Yo Oizumi in the original Japanese releases of the series, and by Christopher Robin Miller in English- language releases. Design Professor Layton was designed by Akihiro Hino, CEO of Level-5. When designing the game, he thought about what kind of character would make an \\"interesting lead\\". What came to mind was the concept of a famous detective and his assistant, in the manner of Sherlock Holmes. From this idea, he created Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke Triton. The English setting of the games was also inspired by these mystery stories. Professor Layton was also derived in part from Phoenix Wright (from Capcom's Ace Attorney franchise). Hino examined what he believed to be Wright's good and bad points, and designed Layton by overcoming what he saw as Wright's bad points. The idea to voice the characters, despite the idea being uncommon on the Nintendo DS at that time, came about as a means to attract casual players who had purchased Brain Age but were skeptical about playing other, more complex video games. Level-5 enlisted television personalities to voice characters from the game, such as Yo Oizumi being chosen to voice Professor Layton within Japan. For English-language releases in the series, Nintendo selected American voice actor Christopher Robin Miller. Both have reprised their roles for each successive game in the series as well as the animated movie, with Miller being the only cast member who reprises his role in the games' European releases. Appearances =Video games= About thirty years before the events of Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy, Theodore Bronev was born to Leon and Rachel Bronev and had an older brother named Hershel. When he was very young, a cultlike organisation named Targent kidnapped both of his parents for their knowledge of the Azran civilization, leaving Theodore and Hershel behind alone in the house. An elderly couple, Roland and Lucille Layton, came wishing to adopt the child named Hershel. Theodore's brother gave him his name and caused him to be adopted in his place. From then on, Theodore Bronev would be known as Hershel Layton. Then, eighteen years before the events of Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Hershel Layton is in high school and undergoes an archaeological expedition with his close friend, Randall Ascot. While the two explore the Akbadain ruins, they accidentally activate a trap, which leads to the presumed death of Randall. Years later during his years at college, he meets the love of his life, Claire. Claire gives Layton his top hat as a present just before he becomes a professor of archaeology at Gressenheller University, ten years before the events of Professor Layton and the Unwound/Lost Future. Immediately following this exchange, however, Claire is killed in an accident involving a time machine. Professor Layton's drive to be a gentleman, and willingness to solve puzzles, come from these two events. =Prequel Trilogy= At the start of Professor Layton and the Last Specter, Professor Layton receives a letter from a friend of his, Clark Triton, who asks for help regarding a specter terrorizing his town of Misthallery at night. On the way to Misthallery, Professor Layton is stopped by Emmy Altava, an energetic and headstrong young woman who has just been hired as his assistant at Gressenheller University. She joins him, and the two proceed to Clark's house, where Clark's son, Luke, shows the ability to foretell attacks from the specter. Luke sneaks out of his house to assist Professor Layton, and the three of them investigate the specter, eventually finding it to be an excavation machine created by Jean Descole, a masked scientist searching for various ruins (known as the \\"Azran Legacies\\") left by the ancient civilization of the Azran. In an attempt to stop Descole's attacks on the town, Loosha, the last of a race of prehistoric sea creatures, drains the lake at the top of Misthallery by destroying the town's dam, flooding the town and destroying the machines. Within the lake, Professor Layton finds the gate to the Golden Garden, the first of the Legacies, which makes him famous across the world. Following this, Luke Triton asks to become his apprentice; Layton obliges. In Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Angela Ledore, an old high school friend of Layton's, calls Layton to the town of Monte d'Or to investigate the self-proclaimed Masked Gentleman who has been performing terrifying 'miracles' using the power of an artifact called the Mask of Chaos. Eventually, Layton deduces that the Masked Gentleman is Randall Ascot, his best friend from high school, who was presumed to have fallen to his death in the Akbadian ruins eighteen years prior but had actually survived (albeit with amnesia). Jean Descole soon appears, however, and reveals that the Akbadain ruins were the last of the Azran Legacies. Descole states he had planned for Professor Layton to solve the mystery of the Nautilus Chamber (Infinite Vault in the UK) of Akbadain, reviving the lost power source of the Azran Civilization. In Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy, which concludes the prequel trilogy, another archaeologist named Desmond Sycamore calls Layton to the city of Froenborg. This time, he and his companions investigate a 'living mummy' who appears to be a girl named Aurora. Layton then races against a crooked archaeology organization called the Targent, led by his biological father Leon Bronev, in search of the key to the ancient Azran sanctuary. Towards the end of the game, Sycamore reveals himself to be the man under the image of Descole, which he reassumes when he betrays Layton. After Descole rescues Luke from danger and finds himself on the brink of life and death, he states that Leon Bronev is his and Layton's father, and Layton remembers that he is Descole's younger brother. Also, the human race is put in jeopardy when Bronev's uncompromising attitude unleashes an Azran golem horde that terrorizes Froenberg. However, Layton and his companions are able to stop the golems before any more damage is caused. As Bronev is apprehended by the police, he tells Layton that his given name is Theodore Bronev, but Layton refuses to accept this as his real name or recognize Bronev as his father. Nevertheless, he hopes to meet Bronev again one day as a friend and fellow archaeologist. =Original Trilogy= In Professor Layton and the Curious Village, Layton and Luke are called by Lady Dahlia of St. Mystere to investigate the will of the deceased baron, who had mentioned an artifact named the Golden Apple for whom the bearer would be entitled his entire fortune. They slowly manage to unearth the truth about the strange village, but they find that the only person who can show them the apple is none other than the baron's daughter, Flora Reinhold, who had been hidden away in the village for years as part of the baron's plan to find someone smart and kind enough to take care of her. Layton obliges, and takes the girl under his wing, leaving St. Mystere. In Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, Layton and Luke take the Molentary Express in an effort to find out what was responsible for the temporary coma of his teacher, Dr. Andrew Schrader, who was found \\"dead\\" in his office with nothing but a train ticket without a destination, and the artifact he was investigating, the Elysian Box, missing. This was proven to have been taken by Don Paolo, earlier at the start of the game, before Dr. Schrader was found. The two of them, later joined by Flora, go to the towns of Dropstone and Folsense, eventually finding the true purpose of the Elysian Box and reuniting a long-broken family. Finally, in Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, which wraps up the original trilogy, Layton and Luke attend a demonstration of a 'time machine', a failed experiment that leads to the disappearance of both the lead scientist Dimitri Allen and the prime minister, Bill Hawks. Ten years prior, Allen was responsible for the accidental death of Layton's fiancé Claire, who worked as the scientist's lab assistant. A week after the demonstration, Layton and Luke receive a letter purported to be from Luke himself, ten years into the future, in dire need of assistance, and they are asked to go to a clock shop on the edge of town. When they leave it, they find themselves in the future London. They meet with a woman who claims to be Claire's sister, Celeste, who is trying to piece together what actually happened to Claire. After Layton exposes his presumed evil future self as Dimitri Allen, he deduces that he and his friends never traveled through time but instead were transported to a duplicate of London built beneath the original city. The future Luke then reveals himself as Clive, a wealthy young man who lost his parents in the same explosion that killed Claire and now wants to use his mechanical fortress to destroy the real London. With the help of Don Paolo (whom Layton explains was originally named Paul), Celeste, Inspector Chelmey, Luke, and Flora, Layton successfully deactivates the weapon and saves the real London from further destruction. As Clive is apprehended by the police, he thanks Layton for helping him snap out of his criminal insanity. Finally, Celeste reveals to Layton she is in fact his true love Claire, and that the lab accident ten years prior successfully sent her ten years into the future. Claire explains that despite Allen's best efforts to save her, her trip through time is temporary and that she will shortly return to the moment in which she was killed in the lab explosion. The two share a painful and sudden farewell. Layton comes to terms with this realization and, after Claire vanishes, takes off his hat for her out of respect. As the story comes to a close, Luke receives word that his family is moving away, and the game ends with Luke saying goodbye to Layton, hoping to remain good friends, followed by Layton receiving the game's final puzzle in the mail from Luke some time later. =In other video games= Several spin- off titles have been released for the series featuring the character, including social network game Professor Layton Royale and Nintendo 3DS title Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. In the latter, Professor Layton teams up with Phoenix Wright from the Ace Attorney series to solve mysteries in Labyrinthia, a medieval town emphasizing \\"witch trials\\". Though Professor Layton does not appear in the iOS title Layton Brothers: Mystery Room, the game focuses on his son, , who is a renowned detective for Scotland Yard and works in the eponymous Mystery Room with his assistant to solve crimes. In the seventh main title Layton's Mystery Journey, Professor Layton disappears under mysterious circumstances, prompting his daughter, Katrielle Layton, to go looking for him.http://www.layton.jp/lady-layton/index.html =In other media= Professor Layton is featured heavily in Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, an animated movie based on the series that takes place between Last Specter and Miracle Mask. In Eternal Diva, Professor Layton goes to the fictional Crown Petone opera house and is tricked into solving puzzles in a contest to win an alleged Elixir of Eternal Life. Though the Elixir is proven to be a scheme by Jean Descole to unearth the second of the Azran Legacies, the lost kingdom of Ambrosia, Professor Layton is the one who ultimately unlocks the city by discovering and playing a Song of the Sun, along with two other harmonious melodies. Aside from Eternal Diva, Professor Layton has also appeared in manga and in novels. The manga, , is mainly directed toward children and features characters Luke and Flora trying to answer such mysteries as \\"what is under Professor Layton's hat\\"? Three volumes have been released, but none of them in English. The three novels based on the series prominently feature Professor Layton, though, like the manga, they have not been released outside Japan. takes place during the original trilogy of games, in which Professor Layton and company try to solve the mystery of a floating castle believed to contain the people who had recently vanished from the city of London. The second and third books, and , take place during the prequel trilogy. Kaijin Goddo has Professor Layton investigating a series of art thefts performed by the eponymous \\"Phantom Deity\\"; Gen'ei no Mori has him exploring a strange village within the \\"Forest of Illusion\\" in search of his assistant, Emmy, who has been kidnapped. Professor Layton appears in a few episodes of Layton Mystery Tanteisha: Katori no Nazotoki File, an animated series based on the game Layton's Mystery Journey. In these episodes it becomes clear why Professor Layton disappeared. He and Luke are locked up in some coma-like state, inside coffins from what they called the Relics Treasure: a device that serves as a door to the future. It is also revealed that Katrielle Layton is not the professor's biological daughter. Katrielle was born on a sinking ship and was rescued by Luke, who brought her to Professor Layton. The professor decided to adopt her. Reception and legacy Nintendo Power said that Professor Layton was one of their favorite new characters during their 2008 award, with writer Justin Cheng saying that Curious Village's characters, especially Professor Layton and his apprentice Luke, were a reason why the game was so memorable and engaging. GameSpot has referred to him as the \\"Sherlock Holmes of puzzles\\", and said that his voice acting was \\"welcome and familiar\\". In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 33rd best hero in video games, saying Layton proves \\"that there's more to being a hero than brute strength\\". GamesRadar further placed him at number 22 in a list of the 50 best game characters of the generation. UGO Networks placed Layton first on their list of \\"The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games\\". Similarly, Game Pro included him in a list of \\"The 17 Best Pieces of Headwear in Gaming\\", placing Layton 15th. The character has met some criticism, as well. Cracked columnist Luke McKinney listed Professor Layton as third in a list of eight archaeologists who are not good at their job, saying that most of his conclusions are impossible to believe. Since the release of Curious Village, Professor Layton has been compared with several new characters from later titles, including Henry Hatsworth (of EA Tiburon's Nintendo DS title Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure) and Doctor Lautrec (of Konami's Nintendo 3DS title Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights). Noriaka Okimura, the person who designed Doctor Lautrec, stated that, while inspired by Layton, it was not his intention to make the two look alike; he felt it would be awkward for a 19th-century gentleman to not be wearing a hat like Layton's. Kyle Gray, creator of Henry Hatsworth, was more aggressive, stating that Henry Hatsworth is the man you'd call to \\"save the world from an impending collision with an alternate dimension\\", while Professor Layton is the sort of person to call \\"if you need someone to find your missing cat.\\".

It is now home to the Seattle Weekly. It is a six-story plus basement brick building that covers the entire half-block. The dark red brick facade is simply decorated with piers capped with small Ionic capitals and a small cornice, which is a reproduction of the original cornice. Kingsley & Anderson of Seattle were the architects. The National Building was constructed from late 1904 to mid 1905 by the Northern Pacific Railway as part of the road's multimillion-dollar plan to improve their many Seattle properties and capitalize on the city's booming commission trade. One of the building's first tenants was the National Grocery Company which at first only occupied two of the building's eight stories and would later occupy the entire building, becoming its namesake. It would occupy the building until 1930. The building was later home to many small manufacturing and distributing firms and has been an office building since the late 1960s. The National Building individually was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 29, 1982 and became a city of Seattle landmark collectively with the Globe Building, Beebe Building and Hotel Cecil one year later as \\"First Avenue Groups/Waterfront Center\\".\\"City of Seattle Legislative Information Service - Ordinance Number: 111058.\\" City of Seattle: City Clerk's Online Information. City of Seattle, 28 Mar. 1983. Web. 4 Jan. 2011. It is now home to the Seattle Weekly. link Appearance This architectural description of the National building was written for its National Register nomination in 1982: \\"The Western Avenue facade consists of eight bays encompassing storefronts at the ground story, and horizontal window bands in the upper five stories. The bays are defined by nine piers which are expressed externally as pilasters, and terminated at the sixth story by large ionic capitals. Wall planes within each bay are recessed behind the nine pilasters and enriched with molded back surrounds at the sides and top. Fenestration is characterized by a regular system of horizontal window groupings, each consisting of four pivoting windows with transoms. The window bands are separated vertically by wide, unadorned brick spandrels. Two of the bays include fire escapes. The two side elevations incorporate four bays each, and are also defined by pilasters with ionic capitals. Fenestration Includes pairs of square-shaped window openings within each bay at each of the upper five stories. Openings at the ground level of both elevators include storefront windows, small windows and doorways. The east, or Post Avenue, elevation is relatively undistinguished and includes a simple series of horizontal window bands in the upper stories, and a loading dock with large freight doors at the ground floor. Several original elements, including a wide cornice and all but two projecting marquees, are presently missing from the building (these were restored during the building's renovations in 1982).\\" History =National Grocery Company= The National Grocery Company was formed in late 1902 by Portland, Oregon wholesale grocer Julius C. Lang in order to acquire and merge two Seattle wholesale grocery firms: Sylvester Brothers & Co. and Louch-Augustine Co's wholesale arm. The new company moved into the Sylvester Brothers' former location at Occidental and Main Streets in the Union Trust Building.\\"Big Combine Noted: Seattle Grocers in the Deal\\" Seattle Times 23 Nov. 1902. By 1904 they were one of the leading wholesale grocery companies in the Pacific Northwest with 15 traveling salesman on the payroll and their trade extending to Alaska and British Columbia.\\"National Grocery Company, Home of the Reliance Brand of Canned Goods\\" Seattle Times 7 Feb. 1904. =Building site= In the 1890s, The Northern Pacific Railway had acquired large strips of narrow land between Seattle's downtown and the railroad tracks, mostly reclaimed tideland. Their goal was to locate the railroad's terminus here but strong local opposition made them reconsider, eventually leading to the construction of a tunnel and King Street Station. With their original plans scrapped, Northern Pacific rented the property to wholesalers and produce distributors which quickly became a success. Northern Pacific decided to capitalize on this and planned to replace the ramshackle tin buildings with permanent brick warehouses that could be rented to large wholesale firms.\\"Millions Spent by Roads; Important Development Work Under Way by Lines in Seattle\\" Seattle Times 23 Jun. 1904. In 1904, Northern Pacific subsidiary the Northwest Improvement Company hired the Seattle architectural firm of William Kingsley and Joseph Anderson to design two four story brick warehouses that would face each other on Western Avenue between Spring and Madison Streets in the heart of the city's produce district.\\"Good Progress on the New Northern Pacific Building\\" Seattle Times 27 Nov. 1904. Each building, costing about $200,000, would have ample lighting, ten freight elevators, and facilities for moving and storing heavy goods. In the end, only the National Building was built at height.\\"Contract Let for New Brick\\" Seattle Times 13 Sept. 1904. One of the first companies to sign up for the building, which had not yet been built, was the National Grocery Company who had outgrown their small space in Pioneer Square. They leased the southern 40% of the building. As more tenants lined up to lease space in the buildings, Northern Pacific responded by adding two more floors to each building's plans. Both buildings were completed by early 1905 and, realizing the potential, Northern Pacific would build many more warehouses on Western Avenue over the following years. =Later years and restoration= Interior view of the National Building showing exposed brick arches The National Grocery Company moved out of the National building in 1930 but the name of the building stuck. Small produce distributors remained in the building along with a rotating mix of small shops, distributors and offices up until the 1960s when many companies left downtown for newly developed industrial areas south of downtown and in Tukwila that gave better access to trucks and trains. During this time many warehouses along Western Avenue fell vacant and many more were demolished for parking lots. The National Building was the oldest remaining warehouse of the many that the Northern Pacific built. In the early 1980s, the building was acquired by Cornerstone Development Corporation who proceeded to nominate it for the National Register of Historic Places (It was deemed ineligible in a 1979 survey) and began restoring the building for use as offices. When completed they sold the building for $2.16 million to San Francisco-based Seattle Waterfront Associates who as part of their Waterfront Center offices project.\\"Sale of Apartments Tops Transaction List\\" Seattle Times 29 Aug. 1982. Pg. D2. The building was added to the Register of April 29, 1982, the same day as the Globe Building, Beebe Building and Hotel Cecil which occupied the other half of the block. One year later the entire block became a City of Seattle landmark under the title \\"First Avenue Groups/Waterfront Center\\".

It was the third cotton exchange founded in the United States, following those in New York and New Orleans. The exchange in Mobile was followed by exchanges in Savannah and Memphis. History Following the initial success of the exchanges seen in New York and New Orleans, the cotton brokers in Mobile saw the need to protect their local market and to coordinate the rules and regulations for the sale, purchase and handling of cotton. With Thomas K. Irwin as chairman, they founded their exchange on St. Michael Street in December 1871. During the first half of the 1870s the exchange covered fifty-one counties in Alabama and twenty in Mississippi. The exchange moved from St. Michael Street in 1886, into a new Rudolph Benz-designed building at the corner of St. Francis and North Commerce streets. That building burned in 1917, with the firm relocating to another St. Francis Street address facing Bienville Square. The Mobile Cotton Exchange closed in 1942 with an August newspaper announcement that it was closing until the war's end. It never reopened, however.

History Don Bryant in 2017 In 1998, Scott Bomar was asked to assemble a backing band for former Stax artist and songwriter Sir Mack Rice. His concept was to form an updated version of the quintessential Memphis sound embodied by players like Charles \\"Skip\\" Pitts and Ben Cauley, a formidable task he confronted by recruiting the very musicians who served as his inspiration. The Bo-Keys have performed live at various festivals, including The Ponderosa Stomp, London's Barbican Performing Arts Centre, and Lincoln Center's Midsummer Nights Swing Series. In the Spring of 2003, The Bo-Keys recorded their debut album, critically acclaimed The Royal Sessions, at Willie Mitchell's Royal Studio. The group would go on to perform the score for the Academy Award winning film, Hustle and Flow, as well as the song \\"Kick It\\" for the Paramount/Nickelodeon animated feature, Barnyard. In 2008, The Bo-Keys appeared in the film Soul Men, including an on- screen performance with stars Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac.

It preserves Maine's most significant collection of early 20th century public and commercial buildings, and commemorates an urban re-building campaign matched only by Portland's following its own destruction by fire in 1866. The Great Fire of 1911 was Maine's (and one of the nation's) last large-scale urban conflagrations, but resulted in the creation of an early 20th-century urban space relatively unique in Maine or northern New England. The district comprises 48 buildings (and three parks), most of them constructed between 1911 and 1915 in the burned area, which accounted for half of Bangor's commercial core. Stylistically, the rebuilding was mainly a showcase for the Renaissance Revival, but with elements of the Romanesque Revival, Chicago School, Prairie Style, Art Deco, Classical Revival, and Colonial Revival. The designs were contributed by a number of nationally prominent architectural firms, including Peabody and Stearns; Carrere and Hastings; and Jardine, Kent, and Murdoch; as well as U.S. government architect Oscar Wenderoth, and local architects C. Parker Crowell, Wilfred E. Mansur, Victor Hodgins, and Frederick A. Patterson. Every building except one is of brick, though some are steel- framed, two are faced with terra-cotta, and two are completely sheathed in granite. The coloration and patterning of the brickwork is extremely varied. Architecturally significant buildings within the Great Fire District include the: * Bangor Public Library, 1912, Peabody and Stearns * Bangor High School (now apartments), 1912, Peabody and Stearns * Morse Building (now University of Maine art gallery), 1914–1915, Victor Hodgins * First National Bank - Bangor Hydro Electric Building, 1915, Wilfred E.

He then went to the University of Kansas, where he received an M.A. in political science and economics in 1936. After this, he entered the University of Minnesota’s doctoral program in political economy, earning his by a Ph.D. in 1939. Career in government service = Early public service= Staats first entered public service in 1936, after graduating with his master's degree from the University of Kansas, where he spent that summer as a research assistant for the Kansas Legislative Council of Topeka. He was a member of the staff of the Public Administration Service of Chicago from 1937 to 1938 while he was working on his doctorate at the University of Minnesota. He was a Fellow of the Brookings Institution in Washington from 1938 to 1939. = Direct service to Presidents while at BOB and NSC from 1939 to 1966 = Staats joined the Bureau of the Budget (now the OMB) during the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt and was employed by the BOB from 1939 to 1953. At BOB, he served in the Division of Administrative Management (1939–1943), in the War Agencies Section (1943–47), and as its chief (1945–1947). During World War II, Staats was responsible for organizing, financing, managing, and coordinating the principal civilian war agencies. After the war, Staats was promoted to assistant to the BOB director (1947), assistant director in charge of Legislative Reference (1947–1949), executive assistant director (1949–1950), and, following appointment by President Harry Truman, to the deputy director of the agency (1950–1953). Staats left government service for a year after the Eisenhower presidential transition, and during most of 1953 he served as research director for Marshall Field & Company. He returned to government service when he was appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower to serve as Executive Officer of the Operations Coordinating Board of the National Security Council, which was responsible for coordinated implementation of US foreign policies and operations in foreign countries. Staats served from 1954 to 1958. In 1958, Staats returned to BOB and served as assistant director (September 1958-March 1959) before being reappointed deputy director by President Eisenhower (March 1959-61). Staats continued in the deputy director position under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. = Comptroller General from 1966 to 1981 = Staats left BOB to become the 5th Comptroller General of the United States in 1966. On February 11, 1966, President Johnson nominated Staats for the position of Comptroller General, which also involves serving as head of the GAO. The United States Senate Committee on Government Operations held a hearing on March 2, 1966 on Johnson's nomination of Staats to be Comptroller General, endorsed it on the same date, and on March 4, 1966, the US Senate officially confirmed the nomination of Staats to become Comptroller General. Staats was sworn in as Comptroller General by President Johnson on March 8, 1966, at a ceremony at the White House. Staats served until his term, expired on March 3, 1981. As Comptroller General, Staats drew on his many years of government experience, including as a former Deputy Director of the Bureau of the Budget under Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, as he led GAO during a period of change and national turmoil.GAO: Working for Good Government Since 1921: Chapter 6, Elmer B. Staats: Broadening GAO's work, 1966-1981 by GAO Historian Maarju Krusten (GAO History 1966-1981) In reflecting on Staats's tenure, a senior GAO manager referred to him in 1981 as \\"a pragmatic agent of good government,\\" who viewed GAO's reports as \\"a way to achieve results rather than simply hitting someone over the head.\\" Staats was a strong advocate of public service and constructive change, who worked to improve management throughout the government. Within GAO, he practiced a participatory management style, often relying on task forces to study job processes and organizational issues. Staats focused on improving GAO's internal planning processes and on expanding its work and issue areas to more effectively serve the Congress. Not only the Comptroller General broadened GAO's work but also he increased the agency's services to Congress. When Staats took charge of GAO in 1966, less than ten percent of the total effort of its professional staff went toward providing direct assistance to the Congress. By the time he left office in 1981, the number had risen to nearly 40 percent. Under Staats, GAO worked on a number of issues of great national importance. Before the Federal Elections Commission assumed oversight of campaign expenditures in 1974, GAO's Office of Federal Elections undertook a number of reviews, some of which touched on Watergate. GAO also did important work on energy issues, consumer protection, the economy, and New York City's fiscal crisis. As the Vietnam War intensified and defense spending rose, Staats in 1966 opened an office in Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam. GAO's auditors worked in the field as well as in Saigon. Some of the fieldwork was done under hazardous circumstances. In 1969, six auditors narrowly escaped injury during a rocket attack on the base at Da Nang, South Vietnam. GAO's Saigon office remained operational until the peace accords in 1973. During his tenure, Staats worked to improve governmental accountability. He revitalized GAO's work with the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program. Under Staats, GAO took a lead role in issuing auditing guidance. In 1970, the Bureau of the Budget and GAO agreed on the formation of a government auditing standards task force, which undertook a lengthy research and drafting process. As a result of the work of the task force, the Comptroller General issued in 1972 the first edition of the Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities & Functions, which came to be known as the \\"Yellow Book.\\" In later years, GAO gave the book a more concise title, Government Auditing Standards, and updated its guidance periodically. In addition to issuing guidance to help state and local auditors, the Comptroller General played a key role in establishing intergovernmental audit forums in the 1970s. As comptroller general, he served as the first chairman (1970–1981) of the Cost Accounting Standards Board, and as a member of a number of Presidential and Governmental Advisory Bodies, including the Commission on Government Procurement (1971–1973); President's Commission on Budget Concepts (1967–1968); Commission on Federal Paperwork (1976–1978); Treasury Department's Advisory Committee on Federal Consolidated Financial Statements (1976–1979); National Advisory Committee for the Work in America, Inc. (1979–1980); Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board (1980–1981); Board of Governors, International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (1969–81), Technology Assessment Advisory Council (1972–1981); Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (1966–1981); and the President's Management Improvement Council (1979–80). GAO changed radically during the Staats period. These changes generally reflected the shift to program evaluation, the emergence of a host of new foreign and domestic problems, and Congress's increasing assertiveness in its relationships with the executive branch. Staats provided effective leadership as GAO strove to meet the new challenges, as he was widely respected in the Congress and in the government as a whole.GAO History 1921- 1991, Roger R. Trask, GAO History Program, Nov. 1991 = Later life= After serving as Comptroller General, Staats became the president and later chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation until his death in 2011. Other professional activities and associations In addition to his government service, Staats made contributions though his numerous professional activities and associations.

Enlistment information William Leeming Harrison enlisted in the 220th Battalion (12th Regiment York Rangers), CEF of the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 3 April 1916 in his home town of Toronto. He gave his birth date as 30 December 1897, although he may have provided a false age. He was a student living at home with his father, Doctor William Spencer Harrison. The military doctor noted the younger Harrison's age as 18 years 3 months, his appearance as fair, with brown eyes and dark hair. He was 5 feet 11 inches tall, and had a scar on his right thumb. First World War Circumstances of Harrison's early service are still cloudy. There are two records of his becoming an officer. On 29 May 1917, Harrison was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Canterbury Mounted Rifles. Effective 17 June 1917, Harrison was commissioned as a probationary second lieutenant. He finished pilot's training in summer 1917 and was assigned to fly a Nieuport in C Flight, 40 Squadron. On 9 August 1917, he destroyed a German observation balloon over Arras for his first victory.

On 26 February, he drove down an Albatros D.V out of control. Mid-day and late afternoon wins on 6 March made him an ace. He scored five more times in March, ending the month as a double ace. After destroying another German plane on 1 April, he was promoted to captain and transferred to 1 Squadron as a flight commander. He destroyed a Pfalz D.III on 11 April 1918, to round out his tally at a balloon and seven enemy airplanes destroyed, and four driven down out of control. He was then wounded and left combat duty.

Storyline The episode starts with paramedics Tom Neilson and Sam Aleni driving down a road with their siren on. Tom's wife Marjorie Neilson answers the phone and hears of a car crash involving a young couple by a construction site. Tom and Sam arrive at the scene to find a teenager in labour having received head injuries. Tom is surprised to find his teenage son Stuart at the scene. Against protocol, Tom and Sam decide to take the woman to Shortland Street Clinic as a result of her brain injury. Meanwhile, the new doctor Hone Ropata arrives at the clinic. Director of nursing Carrie Burton welcomes him and begins to give him a tour of the building. Nurse Alison Raynor attends to a young aggressive teenage hoodlum who refuses help. The paramedics arrive at the clinic and ask for a doctor. Carrie asks receptionist Kirsty Knight to call for Dr. Chris Warner. Meanwhile, Chris is seducing his aerobics instructor who has turned his bleeper off. Hone decides he has to deliver the baby and goes against protocol to do so. Carrie advises him not to and reminds him (in a memorable line) that \\"you're not in Guatemala now, Dr. Ropata\\", which Hone ignores. Stuart is denied entrance to the room the girl is giving birth as he is not family, to which he proclaims he is the baby's father. Tom and Marj are shocked that their highly religious son has had sex before marriage. The teenage hoodlum Alison is seeing apologises for her behaviour and Alison tells her it helps to be polite, while her back is turned, the girl goes into Alison's handbag and steals a wad of cash. Kirsty finds Chris and tells him that he is needed. Carrie informs CEO Michael McKenna of Hone's unorthodox procedure to which Michael insists something will be done. Alison talks to Sam about her flat she is moving into but is shocked when she finds her money gone. Hone checks out his exam room and is surprised to meet male nurse Steve Mills who badmouths Chris Warner to Hone, leaving him with a bad impression. Steve is later shown to have a crush on Alison. Chris arrives back to the hospital and meets Hone. The two are stopped by Michael McKenna who questions Hone's methods and why Chris was gone the whole day. Cast The episode ends with a still of Chris Warner who would later go on to become the longest serving character on the soap. * Paul Gittins as Dr. Michael McKenna * Elizabeth McRae as Marjorie Neilson * Adrian Keeling as Paramedic Tom Neilson * Rene Naufahu as Sam Aleni * Martin Henderson as Stuart Neilson * Lisa Crittenden as Nurse Carrie Burton * Danielle Cormack as Nurse Alison Raynor * Temuera Morrison as Dr. Hone Ropata * Angela Dotchin as Kirsty Knight * Michael Galvin as Dr. Chris Warner * Andrew Binns as Nurse Steve Mills * Anna Cathie as Lisa Stanton, the pregnant teenage girl * Krista Nobilo as Tara Milburn, the teenage hoodlum * Suzy Aiken as Jill Johnstone, the aerobics instructor Production The word placenta was not allowed in the first episode of the show as it was considered to be too risque for a 7pm timeslot. Given that a major storyline of the first episode revolved around a woman giving birth, this was a tricky word to avoid. The line \\"you're not in Guatemala now, Dr. Ropata\\" was also originally cut from the first script because it was deemed \\"too silly\\", but then it was put back in at the last minute - and is now an iconic piece of New Zealand television history. The line was originally written as, \\"You're not in Central America now\\" but a script editor decided that \\"Guatemala\\" sounded better. Before the show was launched, it was called The Shortland Street Project because the plan was to shoot the show in a studio TVNZ owned on Shortland St in central Auckland. However, after working out an initial floor plan, the production crew realised that the space in Shortland St was going to be far too small to accommodate the sets that they required and they moved to a warehouse space in Browns Bay. After running through several name options, including A&E;, the network execs agreed that the original idea was the one to go for and Shortland Street was born. Reception The episode was met with mixed reviews with reviewers stating “New soap has dead-end feel to it” and “Soap gets thumbs down”.http://www.throng.co.nz/shortland-street/4000th-episode Many also predicted the soap would not last long before cancellation. The Sunday news stated the soap was full of; \\"Over-acting, under-acting, cliched characters, corny scripts, sluggish editing, dated camera shots and tediously drawn-out scenes.\\" However other reviews stated much to the contrary with headlines such as; \\"Just what the doctor ordered\\", \\"Fine pedigree behind new medical soap\\", and \\"Quick pace sets new soap apart\\". =Pop culture significance= The original cheesiness of the episode and several ideas have become historically significant in New Zealand pop culture history. The phrase \\"You're not in Guatemala now Dr. Ropata\\" instantly became Kiwiana and even came 31 in the top 100 Pop culture stories on Rocked The Nation 2. Chris' raunchy sex scene with his aerobics instructor also became instantly famous as the show aired at such an early timeslot it was subjected to children viewing.

Part of the Chilean Andes' volcanic segment, it is considered a member of the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ), one of the three distinct volcanic belts of South America. This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile's western edge, and includes more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields. Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains. Calabozos and the majority of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Calabozos is responsible for the huge Loma Seca Tuff, a body of material to in volume. It accumulated over at least three eruptive periods, beginning 800,000 years ago (0.8 mya) and lasting until 150,000 years ago (0.15 mya). The caldera's dimensions are by , and it has an elevation of . Activity from the caldera has produced many other stratovolcanoes to form a complex volcano.  Geography and structure  Calabozos lies in central Chile's Maule Region, near Curicó and Talca, on the western Andes.Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 45. This is an area of poorly glaciated mountains that is not permanently populated. There are no roads, and it is only accessible via horse or on foot.Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 47. Calabozos is part of the South Volcanic Zone, which runs along the western edge of central Chile and extends south, jumping the border to continue its course in Argentina. This range includes at least nine caldera complexes, more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the Quaternary, and hundreds of minor eruptive centers. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year. Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater, located to from the north side of Cerro Azul's summit, and its most active volcanoes are Llaima and Villarrica.Stern et al. (2007), pp. 154–156. Calabozos is a ring-shaped caldera by wide, with an elevation of . Volcanoes have been formed by eruptions in the crater. The largest, which is on the southern rim of the caldera, is the Holocene Cerro del Medio complex with an elevation of . It is made mainly of andesite and dacite, and has a volume of to . On the southwestern edge several eruptions have created the Descabezado Chico volcano (elevation: ) which consists of four overlapping volcanic craters. The last eruption occurred during Holocene time, and produced a dacitic lava flow ( in volume) that extends for . Cerro Colorado, with an elevation of , forms another cone in the complex. Towards the center of the caldera, hot springs including Cajon Los Calabozos and Baños de Llolli are present. The springs are as old as 0.3 mya, and may have formed directly after Calabozos's second eruption as a result of uplift caused by re-occurring activity in the caldera. The vents occur in two clusters, Colorado and Puesto Calabozos, and are located along the margin of a fault at the southwestern edge of the caldera.Grunder et al. (1987), p. 289. Hildreth et al. (1983) evaluated that Calabozos could potentially be useful for the harvesting of geothermal energy.Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 53. Geology The subduction of the Nazca Plate resulted in the formation of the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Peru–Chile Trench. Subduction of the eastern edge of the Nazca Plate under the western edge of the South American Plate occurs about west of Peru and Chile, at a rate of 9 to per year at 30 degrees south latitude. This subduction process has resulted in the formation of the Peru–Chile Trench, an oceanic trench in the Pacific Ocean. It also produced the Andean Volcanic Belt and the rest of the Andes. Calabozos is one of 44 Holocene epoch volcanoes located in central Chile and Argentina. It is included within the Southern Volcanic Zone, the most active section of the Chilean Andes. The date of its last known eruption is not known with precision, though it took place during the Holocene. Through K-Ar dating, geologist Robert Edward Drake established the age of 66 events in central Chile, and divided them into groups based on the time of their origin. In a paper published in 1976, he described the location of each group and the west-east-trending movement of volcanism in the range. To the west of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2 mya). The scale of the eruptive events that produced these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4 mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet, though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5 mya, and have erupted almost continuously since. = Local = Calabozos lies in an area between thick and thin continental crust, and its eruptions are probably fed from a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera.Grunder (1988), p. 71. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions).Grunder (1987), p. 72. Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates. Calabozos is similar in age to Cerro Azul and Descabezado Grande, and its eruptions may correspond to past activity at both volcanoes. Eruption products of very similar composition (including mafic andesite, agglutinates, and dacite) make up the volcanoes. There is also a similarity in size (all are between 40 and 70 cubic kilometers in volume).Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 51. The volcano appears to be part of a north-south trending group of rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and- thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate. = Geologic record = In comparison to the well- preserved rocks of the dry, central part of the Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40 percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock. While the volcanic history of the area extends back far further, the earliest fully recognizable events in the region are recorded in the pyroclastic Campanario Formation. This sequence appears to begin at Laguna de la Invernada and ranges from 15 to 6 mya. Remnants of magma intrusions as young as 7 mya can be found at the lake (Laguna de la Invernada).Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 48. The most recent volcanic phase began about 4 mya, producing largely andesitic eruptions. A series of eruptions built up a broad plateau of lava, and extended over the area where Calabozos now lies. Locally, this plateau was composed of mafic andesite with olivine, which over time gathered to form to thick layers. Nearby volcanoes sit on top of two mya lavas that formed during this period, while the Loma Seca Tuff lies atop andesitic deposits from Descabezado Grande. =Composition= Calabozos lies between two different types of volcanism—to its north, andesite and rhyolite are the primary constituents of lava while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic andesite and basalt. It is mainly basaltic andesite and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos, forming a calcalkilic suite rich with potassium. Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts, which vary from 2 to 25 percent of their mass.Grunder and Mahood (1988), p. 831. These phenocrysts are typically made of plagioclase, but also contain clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite, and titanomagnetite.  Climate and vegetation  The area's rainfall averages annually, varying from at its lowest to at its highest. Precipitation between May and August (primarily snow) is normally 20 to 35 centimetres, dropping to below one centimetre during summer. Temperature is also variable, typically registering 25 degrees Celsius during the summer, but dropping below freezing at high elevations (above ). Vegetation is rare in the area. The 1932 eruption of Cerro Azul's Quizapu Crater reduced much of the land to a pumice desert. Above , vegetation becomes even more sparse. Eruptive history rhyodacitic and dacitic in origin. During the late Pleistocene, Calabozos erupted tuff composed primarily of rhyodacite and dacite. Three distinct eruptions have taken place within the last million years. The sheets of remaining ash left over from all of the eruptions together range from to in volume and are known as the Loma Seca Tuff. The first eruption, which took place 0.8 mya, was distinct from later eruptions in that its product lacks flattened lenticles (lens-shaped layers of mineral or rock embedded in rock). The tuff is dotted with predominantly plagioclase phenocrysts, which make up between less than 5 to approximately 15 percent of each particle's mass. After being erupted, the material settled in canyons, where it underwent glaciation. This carved cliffs which drop as much as . The tuff is limited to just a few kilometers around the complex.Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 49. Taking place 0.3 mya, the second eruption was the most extensive. It was probably between and in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera, down the adjacent foothills. Beyond the caldera, the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts (unlike those of the first eruption). They are instead rich in lithic material, which makes up as much as 10 percent of the rock in parts (50 percent at the base of the caldera). As the first of the ash was deposited, it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion, but only partially melded together. However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away at it, in the form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its pumice content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30 percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of devitrification and lithic content. The differences between these two deposits can be accounted for by a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion can be explained by the presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas. The third eruption was high in fiamme (on the right), and erupted material with large phenocrysts. Activity continued for approximately 150,000 years in the form of quiet andesitic eruptions, as glaciation took place. About 0.15 mya (150,000 years ago), a third and final ash flow was erupted. With a volume of to , it was smaller than the second eruption, but acted similarly, and had much more densely welded tuff. The ash was thickest at , at Loma Seca, and the top of the deposit has undergone erosion. It is densely welded in crevasses, but not at thin layers, where much of the material is barely welded or not welded at all. The first layers of the last deposit were alternating belts of light and dark-colored material, and were densely welded. They appear to have been erupted in pulses, and continue for hundreds of meters. Deposition was continuous except for one interruption, which can be seen at proximity to the caldera, where the layers are replaced by thin, nonwelded sheets of lava. Another zone of nonwelded material, about and near Cajon Los Calabozos, underwent no erosion, suggesting that activity stopped, then began again. High in fiamme, the third tuff layer differs from the second in that it has even higher phenocryst content, but poor lithics. In the fiamme, phenocrysts constitute between 5 and 15 percent of the rock, increasing to 25 to 30 percent near the caldera. In the younger emplacements, clinopyroxene is evident along with an increase in mafic content.Hildreth et al. (1984), p. 50.  Threats and preparedness  Calabozos is in the South Volcanic Zone, which contains potentially deadly and active volcanoes such as Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80 reported episodes of volcanism since 1558, and at least 40 South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions. Its remoteness means that Calabozos poses little threat to humans, but if necessary relief efforts could be orchestrated. The Volcanic Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) formed in response to the famous eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia and saved lives following the 1991 eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile by organizing evacuations. The team's stated aim is to \\"reduce eruption-caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries\\". Made up of various USGS offices such as the Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO), responsible for monitoring Mount St. Helens, the team has equipment to monitor any volcano, allowing the timely prediction of volcanic eruptions and the evacuation of nearby homes.

He had four brothers, Michel-Joseph Gebauer (1763–1812), Pierre-Paul Gebauer, Jean-Luc Gebauer, and Étienne-François Gebauer, all of whom were also musicians and composers. The brothers played together in a quintet that was modeled on woodwind quintet instrumentation but modified by removing the flute parts to include their brother Jean-Luc, who was a percussionist. The quintet received favorable reviews from critics, who found the music to be \\"unusually lively for a wind quintet\\" and \\"full of earthly elegance\\". He took music lessons first with his brother Michel-Joseph Gebauer, which ended soon due to artistic differences between the two. He then took lessons with François Devienne, which proved to be more successful. In 1788 he joined the Swiss Guard in Versailles as a bassoonist. In 1790 he joined the orchestra of the Musique de la garde nationale de Paris. From 1801 to 1826 he was a bassoonist in the orchestra of the Paris Opera. In 1795 he was appointed professor of bassoon at the Conservatoire de Paris, a post he held until 1802 and then from 1824 to 1838. His most famous work was Duos Concertants, Op. 48, for horn and bassoon, which featured repetitive rhythmic motifs in phase shifting patterns and strikingly modern asymmetrical melodies. The most memorable effect he achieved with this piece was the portrayal of schadenfreude through jarring note patterns in the bassoon line.

These neurologic impairments make it difficult for individuals with motor speech disorders to plan, program, control, coordinate, and execute speech productions.Duffy, J. R. (2013). Motor speech disorders (3rd ed.)St. Louis, MO: Elsevier Mosby. Disturbances to the individual's natural ability to speak vary in their etiology based on the integrity and integration of cognitive, neuromuscular, and musculoskeletal activities. Speaking is an act dependent on thought and timed execution of airflow and oral motor / oral placement of the lips, tongue, and jaw that can be disrupted by weakness in oral musculature (dysarthria) or an inability to execute the motor movements needed for specific speech sound production (apraxia of speech or developmental verbal dyspraxia). Such deficits can be related to pathology of the nervous system (central and /or peripheral systems involved in motor planning) that affect the timing of respiration, phonation, prosody, and articulation in isolation or in conjunction. Dysarthria Dysarthria is the reduced ability to motor plan volitional movements needed for speech production as the result of weakness/paresis and/or paralysis of the musculature of the oral mechanism needed for respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation, and/or prosody. Apraxia There are two types of Apraxia. Developmental (or Childhood Apraxia of speech) or acquired Apraxia. Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a neurological childhood speech sound disorder that involves impaired precision and consistency of movements required for speech production without any neuromuscular deficits (ASHA, 2007a, Definitions of CAS section, para. 1). Both are the inability to plan volitional motor movements for speech production in the absence of muscular weakness. Apraxia is not a result of sensory problems, or physical issues with the articulatory structures themselves, simply the way the brain plans to move them. Developmental verbal dyspraxia Developmental verbal dyspraxia is a developmental inability to motor plan volitional movement for the production of speech in the absence of muscular weakness.

It has a single thin leaf and up to thirty green to brownish-green flowers with red stripes and a red-tipped labellum with hairy edges.Genoplesium fimbriatum habit Description Genoplesium fimbriatum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long with the free part long. Between five and thirty lemon-scented flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are green to brownish- green with red stripes and are long, wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide with red stripes, a hairy edge and a sharp tip. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, free from each other and spread widely apart. The petals are egg-shaped, pointed, about long and wide and striped with long hairs on the edge. The labellum is linear, long, wide with its red tip curled upwards and long pink to red hairs on its edge. The labellum quivers in the slightest breeze. Flowering occurs between December and May. Taxonomy and naming The fringed leek orchid was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Prasophyllum fimbriatum and published the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium fimbriatum and in 2002 changed the name again to Corunastylis fimbriata but the latter change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The specific epithet (fimbriatum) is a Latin word meaning \\"fringed\\" or \\"fibrous\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium fimbriatum grows in a range of habitats including open forest, heath and moss gardens. It is found in near- coastal areas and nearby tablelands between Stanthorpe and Vincentia. It often occurs in areas with frequent wildfires and a relatively high rainfall.

La Manga del Mar Menor itself is a narrow strip of land between two seas, the Mediterranean and Mar Menor, measuring up to 300m in breadth & 21 km in length. It has over 40 km of sandy beaches, a casino, hotels, and is close to the airport, Murcia central, and to one of the oldest cities in Spain, Cartagena. Los Alcazares is an old fishing village of 20 km2 with 7 km of beaches from Los Narejos to Punta Brava. There is good transport to Los Alcazares and other nearby places.

His masterpieces are probably the Nichols Block and Columbia Building (both 1892), in which he used a Romanesque Revival style with exuberant patterned brickwork, and the Graham Building of 1911, among the most prominent landmarks in downtown Bangor.

A passage of Theophanes the Confessor incorrectly identifies him as \\"Constantinus\\" (Constantine).Martindale (1992), pp. 352–353  Biography  = Origins and early career: dux of Moesia = According to John Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor, Constantiolus was a son of Florentius. No details are given about him, though he could be identified with Florentius, Roman consul in 515. Constantiolus is first mentioned as \\"stratelates of Moesia\\" in 528, in succession to Justin, who had been killed in battle earlier that year. Justin and Baduarius, dux of Scythia Minor, had joined their forces in battle against a force of foreign invaders, who Malalas identifies as \\"Huns\\", while Theophanes as Bulgars.Martindale (1992), pp. 163–164 It is likely that Constantiolus held the title of dux Moesiae Secundae and the rank of magister militum (often rendered in Greek as stratelates). The newly appointed Constantiolus joined forces with Ascum and Godilas in facing the invaders, who were at the time active in Thrace. The Byzantine army managed to defeat one group of invaders in battle, but they were then ambushed and routed by a second group of Huns/Bulgars. Both Constantiolus and Ascum were captured by their enemies. The victors ransomed Constantiolus back to Justinian I in exchange for a large sum. Malalas reports a payment of 10,000 solidi, while Theophanes of 1,000 solidi. = Imperial representative = Constantiolus resurfaces in 531, after Belisarius' defeat by the Sassanid Persians at the Battle of Callinicum (19 April 531). Justinian sent Constantiolus to the eastern border, assigning him to investigate the circumstances of the defeat. Constantiolus traveled through Antioch and questioned various Byzantine commanders on the subject. Among them was the magister officiorum Hermogenes, who had served under Belisarius in the battle.Martindale (1992), p. 591 Constantiolus returned to Constantinople with his findings. His report probably contributed to the end of Belisarius' service as magister militum per Orientem and his replacement by Mundus. = The Nika riots = Constantiolus next appears during the Nika riots in 532, where he, along with Mundus and Basilides, served as envoys of Justinian to the rioting crowds. They partly attempted to calm the rioters and partly attempted to understand the causes of their wrath. Their report to the emperor placed the blame for the uprising on the unpopular financial ministers John the Cappadocian, Tribonian and Eudaemon, leading to their dismissal from office. As the riots did not subside, Justinian considered fleeing Constantinople, and Constantiolus and Mundus were assigned to guard the palace in his absence. Justinian was in despair, but his wife Theodora is said to have dissuaded him, saying, \\"Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss. Never will I see the day when I am not saluted as empress.\\"Diehl, Charles. Theodora, Empress of Byzantium (© 1972 by Frederick Ungar Publishing, Inc., transl. by S.R. Rosenbaum from the original French Theodora, Imperatice de Byzance), p.87. Although an escape route across the sea lay open for the emperor, Theodora insisted that she would stay in the city, quoting an ancient saying, \\"Royalty is a fine burial shroud,\\" or perhaps, [the royal color] \\"Purple makes a fine winding sheet.\\"Procopius, Wars 1.24.32–37. For the possibility of Theodora's stirring remarks being an invention by Procopius (otherwise an unflattering chronicler of Theodora's life), see John Moorhead, Justinian (London/NY 1994), pp. 46–47, with a reference to J. Evans, \\"The 'Nika' rebellion and the empress Theodora\\", in: Byzantion 54 (1984), pp. 380–82. Constantiolus took part, with Belisarius and Mundus, in attacking the crowds within the Hippodrome of Constantinople. The event ended the Nika riots and also seems to be the last chronological mention of Constantiolus.  References   Sources  *Diehl, Charles.

Early life He was the son of Frederick Hiram and Louise (Price) Parks. Parks was orphaned at an early age, and lived with relatives in Brooklyn, New York, Rochelle, Illinois and Danbury, Connecticut, acquiring his early education in various schools. He began his business career in 1888 as a dealer of hides and tallows in Danbury, Connecticut, and two years later, in association with Edward Solomon Parks, his brother, and John Norris, organized the Danbury Fertilizer Co. for the manufacture of fertilizer. Early in 1894 he purchased from his partners the hide and tallow division of this company. The business made tallow from animal fat and bones, which were generally regarded as valueless. Hat business Around 1896, with his brother Edward, he opened a business recovering shellac from stiff hat roundings, which until this time had been regarded as worthless by-products of the hat factories. This business proved successful, especially after he had learned to treat the fur product after removal of the shellac, so that with other furs it could be utilized in the manufacture of felt hats. In January 1901 he formed a partnership with Joseph P. McGovern of New York, then the senior partner in the firm of J.P. McGovern & Bro., brokers in hatter's furs, in order to further expand the business of the manufacture of hatter's furs. This business, incorporated as American Hatters and Furriers Corp., with a capital of $50,000, was increasingly successful year by year, and in 1906 was reorganized as the American Hatters and Furriers Co., Inc., with a capital of $500,000. Mr. Parks was president and manager of this company, with Mr. McGovern acting as treasurer and vice president. After Mr. McGovern's death in 1912, the business continued with Mr. Mercier as treasurer. When Mr. Parks died, the capital was $1,250,000. Other roles In 1903 Mr. Parks organized the successful Connecticut Glue Co., of which he was President and Mr. McGovern treasurer. This company was organized to make use of the by-product from the cutting of rabbit skins, the pelt being used to good advantage in the manufacture of \\"Pure Rabbit Skin Glue.\\" Mr. Parks was also president of Star Oil Co., Sunfast Hats, Inc., and Irving Trust Co. As a controlling stockholder in Parks- Mercier, Inc., and as president of the C. D. Parks Co., he was interested in large realty holdings. On his extensive country estate in Danbury, \\"Tarrywile\\", he maintained a large dairy establishment stocked with the fine cattle and modern equipment. Mr. Parks was vice president of the Danbury Agricultural Society, which conducted the Danbury Fair; vice president of the Danbury Chamber of Commerce; a member of the Danbury board of finance; and a trustee of the Wooster School, Danbury. For his record in selling Liberty Loan bonds during World War I, he received a special testimonial from the United States government. He attended the Bridgewood Country and the Danbury clubs of Danbury; the Norwalk Country Club; the Algonquin Club of Bridgeport; the Chemists Club of New York City and the Metabetchuan Club of Canada. Personal life Parks was a lover of nature, literature and music. He was married on December 4, 1889 to Eleanor Sophia, the daughter of Wallace Bruce Parks, of Moreau, New York. They had two daughters: Irene, wife of Louis Chadwick Rathmell; and Jeanette Darling, wife of Dr. Donald Alexander Davis. In 1910, Charles Darling Parks bought Tarrywile Mansion from Dr. William C. Wiles. He enclosed much of the original estate with a stone wall, created a lake and several ponds, constructed a greenhouse, and added a conservatory to the main house. Later, in 1918, C. D. Parks then bought \\"Buck's Castle\\" for his oldest daughter, Irene Parks, as a wedding gift, whose reception was the first to be held in the mansion. During this time the castle was renamed Hearthstone Castle. He acquired his property by buying up woodlands in the surrounding mountains. It is said that many a \\"mad hatter\\" suffering from the effects of mercury poisoning was put to work on the Parks’ farm. An experimenter, Parks fostered the development of new fur-cutting processes and of a nonmercuric carroting solution that eliminated the risk of mercury poisoning to employees. At one time, the family holdings totaled well over 1,000 acres. It included one of the State's largest independent dairy farms, as well as cornfields, and peach and apple orchards. Faithful to C. D. Parks' vision and commitment to creating a place of natural beauty, his heirs (led by his daughter Jean Parks Davis and her husband Dr. Donald Davis, along with her sister Irene Parks Jennings Rathmell and heirs) held on to most of the property through the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1985 the City purchased the estate consisting of 19 buildings and 535 acres, which is designated for passive recreation. Mr. Parks died at Danbury, Connecticut on September 14, 1929.

In 1837, the First Board of Trade came into existence to promote trade through the port of Wilmington. As one of their first actions, the organization sent a petition to Congress asking for a permanent custom house. Representative George R. Riddle secured appropriations for what was intended to be a dedicated customs house in 1852 which was completed in 1855. Despite the intent for a single-use facility, the Federal Court and the Post Office also shared the building until 1897.Scharf, p. 766. During the Korean and Vietnam war periods, the Old Customshouse served as the Delaware initial reporting and induction site for drafted soldiers.Rogerson, Harry, Wilmington: Picturing Change (Charleston, South Carolina): The History Press, 2008), p. 68. . The Wilmington Parking Authority built the Customs House Garage, a 1,335 car facility adjacent to the building. Wilmington University purchased the building from the federal government in 1983 and used it for both business meetings and downtown classes. In 2008, Wilmington University sold the building to a group of investors who then created Old Customs House LLC. Architecture Ammi B. Young designed the Greek revival building. The two-story structure consist of a cut stone base with stucco exterior walls and four smokestacks. It used to have a portico with a triangular pediment but that was removed in 1929. The hip roof is made of iron using innovative foundry technology for the period.

Melbourne, 1882; d. White Plains, New York, 1961), located in the grounds of the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. In the early 1920s, Grainger began to develop an idea for an autobiographical museum so that \\"all very intimate letters or notes should be deposited in an Australian Grainger Museum, preferably in birth-town Melbourne\\".Percy Grainger, letter to Balfour Gardiner, 3 May 1922 (Grainger Museum Collection) Grainger was a linguistic purist, advocating for the use of a 'Blue-Eyed English' derived from Anglo- Saxon and Germanic glossary.http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/261050,percy-grainger-s- hall-of-mirrors.aspx As a result, he generally used the word 'past-hoard- house' for museums, but agreed to the word 'museum' in this case.  Architecture  The Museum was designed by the University's staff architect John Gawler of the local firm Gawler and Drummond, with input and funding from Grainger himself. It was built between 1935 and 1939 on land provided for the purpose by the University of Melbourne, and officially opened in December 1938.George Tibbits, 'Building the Grainger Museum', in Talking Grainger, edited by Kate Darian-Smith and Alessandro Servadei, The Australian Centre and the Grainger Museum, University of Melbourne, 1998, pp. 45-70. Designed specifically to fulfill the role envisioned by Grainger, it is the only purpose-built autobiographical museum in Australia. The building is included on the Register of the National Estate, the Victorian Heritage Register and with the National Trust of Australia (Victoria). The Grainger Museum was closed in 2003 for seven years, for restoration and conservation work, after waterproofing issues were detected. It reopened on 15 October 2010.  The collection  Among displays of original manuscripts and published scores, musical instruments, field recordings, artworks, photographs, books and personal items, are Grainger’s whips and other items relating to his sado- masochism (which Grainger called the \\"Lust Branch\\"), the contents of his bedside cabinet, and a gallery devoted to his mother’s suicide. There are also sound-making devices Grainger used to make his innovative and experimental \\"Free music\\". The substantial archival collection includes some 50,000 items of correspondence (Grainger corresponded with people such as Edvard Grieg, Frederick Delius, Cyril Scott, Roger Quilter and Julius Röntgen, and collected letters of Wagner and Tchaikovsky among others).

He died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic and was seen helping women and children into the lifeboats. Biography Edward Austin Kent was born in Bangor, Maine on February 19, 1854 to Harriet Ann Farnham (1830–1908) and Henry Mellen Kent (1823–1894). Kent moved with his family to Buffalo after the American Civil War, where his father, Henry, opened a successful department store, Flint & Kent. He was the brother of William Winthrop Kent (1860–1955), also a prominent architect who studied under H. H. Richardson, and Charles Farnham Kent (1856–1878), who died aged 22 in Denver, Colorado. Kent attended and graduated from Yale, in 1875, and later the École des Beaux-Arts, the famous Beaux-Arts architecture school in Paris. Returning to the U.S. in 1877, he became junior partner in the Syracuse, New York firm of Silsbee and Kent. In 1884, he returned to Buffalo and remained there for the rest of his career, helping to found the Buffalo Society of Architects and receiving many prominent commissions, including Flint & Kent. Until his death, he lived at the Buffalo Club. In 1912, he took a two-month vacation to France and Egypt and planned on retiring after returning home. He decided to delay his trip home so he could travel on the maiden voyage of the new and luxurious ocean liner, the . = Aboard the Titanic = Grave of Edward Austin KentKent traveled as a first-class passenger. He mingled with the other socialites, including Helen Churchill Candee and Archibald Gracie. He also met on occasion with a writers group. He perished when the ship struck an iceberg and sank on the night of April 14–15, 1912. As the ship was sinking, he disregarded his own safety to help women and children into the lifeboats. He was last seen at around 2:20 a.m. making no attempts to save himself as he was swept into the ocean. His body was recovered by the CS Mackay-Bennett as body No. 258 and claimed by his brother when the ship docked. He was laid to rest in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York.

Personnel psychology is the area of industrial/organizational psychology that primarily deals with the recruitment, selection and evaluation of personnel, and other job aspects such as morale, job satisfaction, and relationships between managers and workers in the workplace. It is the field of study that concentrates on the selection and evaluation of employees; this area of psychology deals with job analysis and defines and measures job performance, performance appraisal, employment testing, employment interviews, personnel selection and employee training, and human factors and ergonomics. History =Twentieth Century= By the end of the nineteenth century, industrial, or personnel psychology, was developed as a way to understand work behavior. One influential figure in the beginning of this new area was Hugo Munsterberg, a German psychologist who was trained by Wilhelm Wundt and who also worked with William James. Munsterberg studied selection and fit in the workplace, and he proposed experimental methods as solutions to business problems in his text, Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (1913). He also served on the faculty at Harvard, and in his writings, talked about such topics as fit in a career, from both an employer's and employee's perspective. Walter Dill Scott, also trained by Wundt and a professor at Northwestern University, is credited with the foundation of I/O psychology, as he used such psychology in advertising and in founding the first personnel consulting firm. =World War I= The time around WW I brought about significant contributions to the field of industrial psychology. Robert Yerkes, along with Walter Van Dyke Bingham and Scott, headed the selection and placement of army personnel with their Army Alpha and Army Beta tests. These test helped to bring attention to testing as a form of selection and their uses in practical applications. This was the beginning of industrial psychology in the real world as opposed to the world of academia. =World War II= World War II was marked by much of the same needs as in World War I. Bingham and Yeakes helped out the military again in developing research programs designed to assess work behavior, including: the Army General Classification Test (AGCT), the Aircrew Classification Test Battery, assessment center methods, and performance appraisal methods. Post World War II advances were also seen in increased doctoral programs, master's degree programs, and the expansion of other already existing programs. =Twenty-first Century= As opposed to war defining most of the twentieth century and the use of the applied psychology, economics will be the main focus of the twenty-first century. Technology is ever changing and decreasing the number of jobs for individuals; organizations are also striving to \\"flatten\\" out in their attempts to move away from largely hierarchical companies, and one other changing area of the twenty-first century is the diversifying of the workplace. All these applications and areas will help to serve as importance for I/O psychology in the workplace and economic world. Uses Personnel psychology is used in a variety of ways. Some of the most important functions it serves range from analyzing corporate culture and individual and group interactions to developing and evaluating employee selection and appraisal techniques. Other areas of use are assessing corporate leadership and employee motivation strategies, identifying causes and resolutions to internal conflicts, advising management of the potential psychological and social impact of corporate policies, and researching ways organizations can effectively manage cultural differences and leadership styles. Personnel psychologists work in a variety of settings, including education, business, community, and agency environments. Many personnel psychologists serve as human resources specialists, helping organizations with staffing, training, and employee development and management in areas such as strategic planning, quality management, and adjustments to organization changes. Personnel psychologists apply psychological theories and principles to organizations. This field focuses on increasing workplace productivity and related issues such as the physical and mental well being of employees. Personnel psychologists use psychological measurement and research findings related to human abilities, motivation, perception, and learning in seeking to improve the fit between the needs of the work organization and those of the people who populate it. =Job Analysis= Job analysis can be defined as \\"A loose term for the study of particular aspects of a given job. Those aspects may range from the tasks and duties of the position, to an examination of the desirable qualities of an employee, to the conditions of employment including pay, promotion opportunities, vacations, etc.\\".Industrial & Organizational Assessment There are many different ways to conduct a job analysis, as there are many different parts to it: job evaluation, job description, and job specifications. The most common tool used to measure job design is the Job Description Survey or JDS, but there is growing literature for other surveys and measures such as the Work Design Questionnaire or WDQ. Such analyses are used to determine \\"what is important\\" within the job description, so as to better educate companies and individuals on the descriptions and requirements of the job. =Selection= Selection involves the exchange of information between applicants and employers. Personnel selection involves the goal alignment of applicants and organizations, however those goals may not always line up at times. Thus selection processes are designed to ensure that those goals line up and individuals are the best \\"fit\\" for the organization. Thus individuals may be likely to adapt their own behavior to better align with an organization. Interviews are one of the most important pieces of information in regards to selection decisions. In the interviews, it is found that individuals are more likely to exhibit organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) in their hopes of being hired by the company, but it is also found that these OCBs play a positive role in the interviewer's evaluation of the individuals. Today, increases in technology have allowed for a much easier administration of such online tests as measures of aptitude, achievement, and personality. Thus these tests are starting to serve as the first hurdle of the selection process, even more so than the interview. =Training= Training relates to an organization giving an individual the skills, knowledge, and abilities to help put the individual in line with the organization's goal. Training provides the opportunity for the individual to gain personal, career, and job-related benefits, such as individual increases in job performance, better career relationships and objectives, and pride and job satisfaction. Research has also shown that the effectiveness of training has a relationship in how the work of an individual is organized. Organizations that allow employees more autonomy and freedom in how they do their work have shown that employees are more able to improve and incorporate training aspects into their work. =Rewards= One major approach to compensation around the world, is performance based pay. Short of job loss, income security is a major stressor for individuals as they stress out over predictability of income. In contrast, other research has also shown though that such pay systems can actual provide motivation, satisfaction, or desired challenge levels to the job, instead of individuals perceiving it is inequality, unfair, or stressful. Stable pay systems have been found to not necessarily be the best link between an individual's performance and his pay level. Stable pay levels can also account for decreases in performance as individuals' incomes are not linked with their performances. Thus these performance levels may drop without a perceived cost to their pay level. It has also been found that individuals who perceive a strong connection between their effort and reward are evaluated more highly and in turn have higher work satisfaction. =Feedback= Feedback has been defined as any response from the environment that helps to influence future actions, information that follows task performance, or information from others in the social world, whether it be approval or disapproval. A positive feedback culture is one in which individuals not only receive and solicit feedback for job performance improvement, but also use both formal and informal feedback as means to accomplish performance goals. Such an environment is created by an employee's direct supervisors and includes the quality and frequency of coaching and informal feedback delivery. Research has found publicly offering employees negative feedback may decrease positive affect and willingness to show organizational citizenship behaviors, and doing so, also increases tendencies to engage in more destructive forms of work behavior References See also * Wiley-Blackwell: Personnel Psychology scholarly journal * Old Dominion University: Industrial / Organizational Psychology university department * English Articles: Personnel psychology article at englisharticles.info website * Personnel psychology at \\"Dr. Dewey's\\" webpage * Industrial & organizational assessment Category:Applied psychology Category:Branches of psychology ","title":"Personnel psychology"},{"id":"30491992","text":"Rory Duncan (born 26 July 1977) is a former South African rugby union coach and former player.

The Holmiidae is a diverse family of eight genera containing at least 17 species. It includes some of the earliest trilobites of Baltica. Holmiidae occur throughout Baltica (Scandinavia and the eastern seaboard of the Baltic Sea) and Western Laurentia (in the Great Basin of the USA and northwestern Canada), and also in Morocco.  Taxonomy  Hupé (1953) defined the Holmiidae as a subfamily (Holmiinae) within the Olenellidae containing Holmia, Kjerulfia and Bondonella. Harrington et al. (1959) excluded Kjerulfia, while assigning Schmidtiellus to it. Bergström (1973) included Holmia, Elliptocephala, Esmeraldina, Schmidtiellus and Wanneria. Repina (1979) assigned Holmia, Schmidtiellus, Kjerulfia, Elliptocephala, Bondonella, Andalusiana and Holmiella to the Holmiinae, that together with the monotypic Callaviinae comprised the Holmiidae. Palmer and Repina (1993) added Holmiella but excluded Kjerulfia, they assigned to the Callaviinae. Lieberman, who made cladistic analyses of the Olenellina and the included superfamilies, regards Andalusiana an advanced \\"Nevadioidea\\", Callavia and Bondonella as Judomioidea, and Elliptocephala and Wanneria stemgroup genera closely related to the common ancestor of the Holmiidae and the Biceratopsidae. Genera * Andalusiana Lotze 1958 * Callavia Matthew 1897 * Cambropallas Geyer 1993 * Elliptocephala * Esmeraldina Resser and Howell, 1938 * Grandinasus Hollingsworth, 2006 * Holmia Matthew, 1890 synonym Baltobergstroemia * Holmiella Fritz, 1972 * Iyouella Geyer and Palmer 1995 * Kjerulfia Kiaer, 1917 * Montezumaspis Hollingsworth, 2006 * Palmettaspis Fritz, 1995 * Schmidtiellus Moberg in Moberg and Segerberg, 1906 = Relationships within the Holmiidae = The eye ridges in Baltic and Moroccan Holmiidae (Holmia, Schmidtiellus) are wide, have a furrow atop the ridges, and the resulting inner band merges with the frontal lobe (L4) of the glabella without an axial furrow. This is interpreted as advanced compared with the arrangement of the simple ocular lobes of Laurentian holmiids, which are separated from the L4 by a prominent axial furrow around the glabellar outline.  Description  As with most early trilobites, Holmiidae have an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent-shaped eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, the Holmiidae lack dorsal sutures in the cephalon. Like all other members of the Olenelloidea superfamily, the eye-ridges spring from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon (or glabella). Specifically for the Holmiidae are the following diagnostic characters. The glabella is straight-sided to somewhat constricted and mostly expands forward. The frontal lobe (or L4) is usually broad and rounded. The furrows that separate the lobes are usually curved, moderately incised, and rarely completely cross the midline. The eye ridges of Baltic holmiids are often wide with an ocular furrow, inner band merging with L4 without axial furrow. Laurentian holmiids (Montezumaspis, Palmetaspis, Grandasinus, Esmeraldina and Holmiella) have unfurrowed ocular lobes separated from L4 by axial furrow. The cephalon carries so called genal spines at the corner between the half circle front/side margin and the back margin that is roughly perpendicular to the midline. These spines extend back to at least the fourth thorax segment (T4), counted front to back. The back margin of the cephalon normally carries a node or spine (or intergenal spine), straight behind the point the eye ridge is furthest from the midline or even somewhat further out. Back margin of cephalon inside the intergenal angle transverse or directed posteriorly. The third thorax segment (T3) is not larger than the neighboring segments and does not carry larger spines. Anterior thoracic pleural spines weakly to strongly thornlike except in Kjerulfia and Grandinasus.

Life He was born at Salisbury, England, on 7 May 1673. and was educated at the free school there. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1688, before he was fifteen, took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. (1694), and was chosen Fellow of his college. In 1700, by chance, he went to Colchester on the death of a clergyman friend there, John Rayne, and was called on to preach the funeral sermon; and was appointed to succeed him. He was instituted 15 January 1701. He left Colchester at the end of the decade, and became deputy chaplain to Chelsea Hospital. He preached a funeral sermon at St Olave's Church, Southwark, and was chosen lecturer there. He was appointed morning preacher at St Lawrence Jewry under John Mapletoft, and was also presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral to St Giles Cripplegate. The presentation, however, involved him in disputes over a tithe on peas and beans. In 1711, he was created D.D. In 1717 he married Elizabeth Hunt of Salisbury, and by her had three daughters. He died on 9 October 1728. Thomas Emlyn praised him for his \\"small respect to decrees of councils or mere church authority\\". Works In 1695, Hebrew verses by Bennet on the death of Queen Mary were printed in the university collection. His first major publication was An Answer to the Dissenters Plea for Separation, or an Abridgment of the London Cases (1699, 5th edition 1711). In 1701 appeared A Confutation of Popery in three parts. In 1702 he followed up his Answer by A Discourse of Schism.A Discourse of Schism, shewing, 1. What is meant by Schism. 2. That Schism is a damnable Sin. 3. That there is a Schism between the Established church and the Dissenters. 4. That this Schism is to be charged on the Dissenters' Side. 5. The modern Pretences of Toleration, Agreement in Fundamentals, &c.;, will not excuse the Dissenters from being guilty of Schism. Written by way of Letter to three Dissenting Ministers in Essex. … To which is annexed an Answer to a Book entitled \\"Thomas against Bennet, or the Protestant Dissenters vindicated from the charge of Schism.\\" Timothy Shepherd of Braintree answered this work, and Bennet replied in 1703.A Defence of the Discourse of Schism; in answer to the objections which Mr. Shepherd has made in his Three Sermons of Separation, and again in An Answer to Mr. Shepherd's Considerations on the Defence of the Discourse of Schism (both 1703). Bennet found another antagonist in a fellow clergyman in A Justification of the Dissenters against Mr. Bennet's charge of damnable Schism, &c.; … By a Divine of the Church of England by Law established, 1705. Bennet's next book was Devotions, viz. Confessions, Petitions, Intercessions, and Thanksgivings, for every day in the week, and also before, at, and after the Sacrament, with Occasional Prayers for all Persons whatsoever. In 1705 Bennet also published A Confutation of Quakerism.A Confutation of Quakerism, or a plain Proof of the Falsehood of what the principal Quakers (especially Mr. R. Barclay in his ‘Apology’ and other works) do teach concerning the Necessity of immediate Revelation in order to a saving Christian Faith. B. Lindley answered this in 1710. In 1708, perhaps stung by passing gibes at his own printed prayers, Bennet published A brief History of joint Use of precomposed set Forms of Prayer, and A Discourse of Joint Prayer, and later in the same year A Paraphrase with Annotations upon the Book of Common Prayer, wherein the text is explained, objections are answered, and advice is humbly offered, both to the clergy and the laity, for promoting true devotion to the use of it. In 1710 these works were tacitly vindicated by Bennet in A Letter to Mr. B. Robinson, occasioned by his Review of the Case of Liturgies and their Imposition, and in a Second Letter to Mr. Robinson on the same subject (also 1710). In 1711 he published The Rights of the Clergy of the Christian Church.The Rights of the Clergy of the Christian Church; or a Discourse shewing that God has given and appropriated to the clergy authority to ordain, baptize, preach, preside in church-prayer, and consecrate the Lord's Supper. Wherein also the pretended divine right of the laity to elect either the person to be ordained or their own particular pastors is examined and disproved. In 1714, Bennet published Directions for Studying. In 1715 appeared his Essay on the XXXIX Articles.Essay on the XXXIX Articles agreed on in 1562, and revised in 1571, … and a Prefatory Epistle to Anthony Collins, Esq., wherein the egregious falsehoods and calumnies of the author of “Priestcraft in Perfection” are exposed. In 1716, he assailed the extruded churchmen of the nonjuring schism in The Nonjurors Separation from the Public Assemblies of the Church of England examined and proved to be schismatical upon their own Principles. In 1718, he published A Discourse of the ever-blessed Trinity in Unity, with an Examination of Dr Clarke's Scriptural Doctrine of the Trinity. Like all his books, these were answered. His idea of the Trinity was Sabellian. In 1726, he gave to the world a small Hebrew Grammar.

Administratively, it belongs to Fahs-Anjra Province and the region of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima. By the census of 2004, it had a population of 10,995 inhabitants.Haut Commissariat au plan, Census 2004 The city is circular, a design unusual in medieval Moroccan town planning. It is built from brick and ashlar masonry and flanked by semi-circular masonry towers. There are three monumental doors in the wall, each flanked by square towers. The Bāb al-Bahr (door of the sea), has an elbowed entrance for defensive purposes. These doors were used both for communication and trade and for taxation purposes. Names The Moroccan Arabic name, meaning \\"The Small Castle\\", can be transcribed l-Qṣər ṣ-Ṣġir or Ksar Sghir. The name distinguishes it from Ksar-el-Kebir (\\"The Big Castle\\"), which is farther south. The Spanish name used to translate this as Castillejo but now transliterates it as Alcázar Seguir or '; its Portuguese equivalent is Alcácer-Ceguer. Under the Almoravids and Almohads, it was known as , , or (\\"castle en route\\") because it was an important embarkation port for Moroccan troops on their way to Spain. Other names for the Muslim fortification include the 11th-century geographer al-Bakri's al-Qasr al-Awwal (\\"The First Castle\\") and the 13th-century historian Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi's (\\"Masmuda Castle\\"), after the local Berber tribe. In antiquity, it was known by the names LissaPlin., Nat. Hist., Book V, §2. and Exilissa (),Ptol., Geogr., Book IV, Ch. i, §3. which Lipiński conjectures represent the survival of the Phoenician settlement's name Ḥiq or Ḥeq-še-Elišša (\\"Bay of Elissa\\"). Note, however, that Pliny and Lipiński place the ancient settlement further east, closer to Benzú.. The Byzantine Greek name was Exilýssa (). Geography Topographic map of the region around Ksar es-Seghir (1954 map) Ksar es-Seghir is located in the Strait of Gibraltar about halfway between Tangier and Ceuta. Situated in a bay on a stretch of coast that is relatively difficult to access by sea or land, Ksar es-Seghir never grew in size to rival the other north Moroccan ports. However, its sheltered position made it attractive as a military landing ground, a place for the safe and orderly embarkation and disembarkation of sea-borne troops, with little danger of disruption or molestation by enemy action.  History Exilissa was probably established as a Phoenician colony, annexed by the Carthaginians, and then lost to Roman control sometime after the Punic Wars. Under the Romans, it was a salting post. It would've been overrun by the Vandals in the 5th century and then reconquered by the Byzantines in the 6th. Ksar Mesmouda was established after the Umayyad conquest of the area in 708-709 CE. In 971, the Umayyad Caliph of al-Andalus tried to capture the fort as a stepping stone to a projected conquest of Idrisid Morocco. During the Almoravid and Almohad eras, it was used as a major shipyard. In 1287, Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf erected a new set of thick walls around the circular town, with 29 bastions and three monumental gates (Bab al-Bahr, Bab Sebta, Bab Fes). But with the end of Marinid adventures across the sea in Spain, it declined in use. By the 15th century, it had become a notorious corsair's nest, preying on shipping in the Straits of Gibraltar. In 1458, a Portuguese expeditionary force of 25,000 men and 200 ships led by King Afonso V of Portugal, assaulted and captured the town after a two-day battle on 23–24 October. The Marinid sultan Abd al-Haqq II of Morocco attempted to recover it immediately, laying sieges in late 1458 and again in the summer of 1459, to no avail. It would remain in Portuguese hands for much of the next century, known by the name of 'Alcácer-Ceguer'. In 1502, the Portuguese began a new set of fortifications that extended the town's walls well into the sea, thereby ensuring a shielded landing ground for Portuguese expeditionary forces in Africa. The resident population of the town under the Portuguese reached around 800 persons. Finding Portuguese holdings in Morocco expensive to maintain, King John III of Portugal decided to abandon it in 1533, although the final evacuation of Ksar es-Seghir would be delayed until 1549. It was recovered by Morocco thereafter, but the departing Portuguese had taken the trouble to evacuate the population, dismantle much of the fortifications and town, and dump debris and sand into the harbor, diminishing its immediate usefulness. In 1609, Ksar es-Seghir became a destination for Moriscos expelled from Spain. Having lost its role as a transit port, Ksar es-Seghir collapsed in size and importance thereafter, becoming a relatively insignificant fishing town, amid the ruins of the old Moroccan citadel and Portuguese fort. A more modern town arose later, on the right bank of the river, across from the old citadel. Ksar Sghir got a new lease on life in the 21st century, when it was slated as the site of a new naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy (construction begun 2008, operational 2010). In 2007, a new commercial cargo port, Tanger-Med began being built nearby, around twelve kilometers to the northeast of Ksar Sghir.

Lawsuit  During the Alberta provincial election in 2008, Martin wrote an article about candidate Arthur Kent published in the National Post and Calgary Herald.

Kent appealed the decision, asking Alberta's Court of Appeal to find the \\"intentional strategic decision to conceal\\" key email records by Martin, the newspapers and their lawyers was, in fact, fraudulent concealment.

Life Bromley traced his descent to Sir Thomas Bromley (1530–1587), Lord High Chancellor of England in the reign of Elizabeth. He was the second son of Samuel Bromley, surgeon in the Royal Navy, and Mary, daughter of Tristram Maries Madox of Greenwich, and was born on 11 June 1813. He was educated at Lewisham grammar school, and in 1829 entered the admiralty department of the civil service. In 1846 Bromley was appointed to visit the dockyards on a confidential mission, shortly after which he was named accountant to the Burgoyne commission on the Irish famine. Here the system which he introduced into the accounts had the effect of bringing more than half a million sterling back to the exchequer, and attracted the attention of the House of Commons. The success with which he had discharged his duties led to his being in 1848 appointed secretary to the commission for auditing the public accounts, into which he introduced improvements which in a great degree remodelled the working of the department. From this period he was frequently employed on special commissions of inquiry into public departments, including that appointed in 1849 for a revision of the dockyards, and that of 1853 on the contract packet system. In recognition of his services Bromley was in 1854 nominated a civil commander of the Bath. On the outbreak of hostilities with Russia he was appointed accountant-general of the navy, the affairs of which he administered with marked ability and success. In 1858 he was created knight commander of the Bath. On retirement from his office through ill-health he was on 31 March 1863 appointed a commissioner of Greenwich Hospital.

Not mentioned in medieval chronicles, he is the subject of possibly legendary or fictional writings from the sixteenth century onwards, the oldest surviving report being that of the Tudor antiquary John Leland.The Itinerary of John Leland in or about the years 1536-1539, Lucy Smith, Volume 3, page 38 Some Welsh family genealogies claimed descent from Einion. Recorded history Einion may have been the brother or son of the historical figure Cadifor ap Collwyn (Cedivor in some anglicisations), Lord of Dyfed.Edmund Burke, A genealogical and heraldic history of the commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank; but univested with heritable honours, entry for Philips of Picton-Castle Cadifor was the male-line heir of the original dynasty of Dyfed (the last of which known to have ruled as king was his ancestor, Triffyn ap Rhain). When Cadifor died in 1092, his sons Einion and Llewelyn (unlike their father) refused to accept Rhys ap Tewdwr as king of Deheubarth, instead sending for Rhys's cousin, Gruffydd; unlike Rhys, Gruffydd was the son of a previous king (Gruffudd's father being Maredudd ab Owain). Although this revolt was crushed, and Cadifor's sons and Gruffydd were killed by Rhys in battle at Llandydoch, it destablised Rhys' kingdom, giving assistance to the Anglo-Norman marcher lords, who were extending their conquests in Wales. Next year Rhys was slain while attacking Bernard of Neumarche (husband of Nest, the granddaughter of the only King of Wales) in Brycheiniog. The conquests of Dyfed and Ceredigion immediately followed the death of Rhys. Einion ap Collwyn's name, however, does not appear in records of this history, and he is mentioned only in the legendary accounts of the conquest of Glamorgan by the Normans. Both Lewis Glyn Cothi and Gwilym Tew say that Einion originated from Gwynedd, while other writers link him to Ednowain ap Bleddyn of Ardudwy and claim he was a relative of Iestyn, perhaps a great- nephew. Legendary material The legend now begins. Einion, the brother of Cadifor, fled from the triumph of Rhys at Llandydoch to Iestyn ap Gwrgant (son of Gwrgan) prince of Morgannwg, who was also a rebel against Rhys. Einion had been previously in England and had served the king in France and other lands, and knew both William II of England and his great barons well. He proposed to bring his Norman friends to Iestyn's aid on condition that he marry the daughter of Iestyn and receive the lordship of Miskin as her dowry. Iestyn accepted the proposal. Einion visited his English friends at London. He persuaded Robert FitzHamon, historically lord of the honour of Gloucester, and twelve other knights, to bring a great army to the aid of Iestyn. Rhys was slain by them in a terrible battle near the boundaries of Brycheiniog, at Hirwaun Gwrgan. With Rhys fell the kingdom of South Wales. The Normans, having done their work for Iestyn, received their pay and returned towards London. They had hardly departed when Iestyn, flushed with his triumph, treacherously refused Einion his daughter's hand. Einion pursued the retreating Frenchmen, explained to them his own wrongs and the general unpopularity of Iestyn, and showed how easy it would be for them to conquer Iestyn's dominions, since his treason to Rhys had so much disgusted the South Wales princes that not one would afford him succour. The Normans were easily persuaded. Einion meanwhile organised a Welsh revolt. They jointly spoiled Morgannwg, but the Normans took the rich Vale of Glamorgan for their own share and left Einion only the mountainous areas of Senghenydd and Miscin, while the sons of Iestyn were rewarded for their acquiescence in their father's fate by the lowland lordship of Aberafan. Induced by the victory of FitzHamon, other Normans seized on Dyved, Ceredigion, Brycheiniog. Thus the treachery of Einion put all South Wales into the hands of the foreigner. This full and elaborate story is first found in the \\"Brut y Tywysogion\\" (first printed in the second volume of the Myvyrian Archaeology, and later with a translation by Aneurin Owen for the Cambrian Archæological Association in 1863). But the original manuscript of this \\"Brut\\" is believed not to be older than the middle of the sixteenth century, and therefore not much earlier than David Powel's History of Cambria (1584), in which the story of the conquest of Glamorgan also appears at length, varying from the above account in only a few details. There are here added, however, long pedigrees of the descendants of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, and it has been suggested that inventors of the pedigrees for Glamorganshire families created the legend.

P. (2007). Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement & Management of Work. Prentice Hall. As the name indicates, the chart deals with the criteria of work elements and their time for both the worker and the machine. This chart is useful to describe any repetitive worker-machine system. Formats A typical worker- machine activity chart consists of two main columns, one for the worker and the other the machine; in some chart formats, there is a third column showing the cumulative time. The chart can also be color-coded to convey information; for example, The time column is used to specify the activity of the worker and the machine, if the column is shaded with black color, it indicates that the worker or the machine is performing an operation, while if it is shaded with gray color, it refers to inspection. For moving, it is customary to refer to it with diagonal lines, whereas horizontal lines indicate a holding activity. If the column is blank then the worker or the machine is idle. For some other uses, there is a same version to accommodate enormous worker-machine interactions, called the multiple worker-multiple machine activity chart. Uses The chart can be used to investigate potential process improvements. It can be used to illustrate delays and redundancy, so process improvement efforts can be made to eliminate inefficiencies and identify the activities that can be combined.

It contains articles for the reformation of monasteries which were proposed by Henry V in 1421, with modifications suggested by various abbots. It appears from this register (f. 32) that he wrote a tract, 'De fraterna correctione canonice exercenda.' A transcript of the register exists amongst the collections of James West in Lansdowne MS. 227, British Museum.

As a defender, he enjoyed spells at Levski Sofia, Lokomotiv Sofia, Yantra Gabrovo, Marítimo, Nacional, Benfica Castelo Branco, Velbazhd Kyustendil and Septemvri Sofia. He was capped by Bulgaria 3 times. He retired as a player in January 2001 at the age of 36. Career He is a member of PFC Levski Sofia , with whom he was also the most successful in his career. He won the 1984–85 A Group championship and the Bulgarian Cup (1986) with the team. Later he performed with less achievements in PFC Lokomotiv Sofia. After the fall of communism he went abroad. For two years he played in Portugal (including S.L. Benfica in Lisbon), but did not make much progress during that period. After returning to the country in 1993 he was mainly active in clubs from the lower leagues. At the beginning of his career he has made three appearances in the Bulgarian national football team. =Manager career= A few years after his football career he started training. He became involved with FC Kaliakra Kavarna's team, there he started as assistant to Velislav Vutsov, who led him to the greatest success in his history: the semi- final of the Bulgarian Cup in the 2007-2008 season . Drugoligowiec of Kavarna eliminated, among others, Chavdar Etropole and PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv, only lost with PFC Cherno More Varna . In the league, the team took second position, which allowed him to play for a place in the league in barracks. However, here is more powerful turned out FC Minyor Pernik, which won the penalty shootout. After leaving Wucowa Zdrawkow he trained Kaliakra briefly. At the beginning of the 2009-2010 season he was offered a job at PFC Levski Sofia as assistant to Georgi Ivanov. However, Ivanov did not have the official training license for UEFA , so the name Zdravkov was entered in the minutes. The Ivanov-Zdravov duo led the club to the third place in the league, guaranteeing a game in the UEFA Europa League. Their mission ended with the end of the game; Yasen Petrov's new trainer was Lewski . Zdrawkow returned to Kaliakry, who at the time was already playing in the first division. At the end of the 2010-2011 season he finished twelfth in the league with a guaranteed place in the league. However, this result did not please activists who in May 2011 gave the trainer a speech. His successor was Adalbert Zafirov. Later he worked again with Ivanov as his assistant in Lewski for several months, and since December 2011 he has been coaching POFC Botev Vratsa.

Bowyer, who came from Wodonga, did not play competitive football until the age of 15. In Melbourne he played his initial football with the Murray Bushrangers and Hawthorn reserves. He made his AFL debut in the final round of the 1999 AFL season, from the rookie list. Prior to the 2000 season he was elevated to the senior list and played 19 games for the year, including two finals. He won a Rising Star nomination, averaged 16 disposals a game over the course of the season as well as taking 120 marks, and was heralded as the club's most courageous player. Used on the ball and as a defender, Bowyer played his 30th consecutive game during the 2001 season and commanded a regular spot in the team until injury struck: in the game best remembered for Ben Dixon's after- the-siren game-winning goal, Bowyer broke his leg. He did not play a single senior game in 2002 due to osteitis pubis and leg problems. As Bowyer recovered from his injuries during 2002, he struggled to cope personally with the isolation of no longer being heavily involved in the game or the club. He struggled badly with depression, and was a heavy user of alcohol and drugs during this time, engaged in self-harm, and contemplated suicide at times.Radio National, The Sports Factor (transcript), \\"Athletes and Depression\\", 10 March 2006, Retrieved 18 April 2011. Late in the year and at the height of his depression, Bowyer traveled to the Greek islands on his own, where he almost lost his life after his left arm was badly cut by glass; the exact nature of this incident has not been publicly discussed.Pierik, J., Herald Sun , \\"Bowyer goes to hell and back, via Greek Islands\\", published in Carlton Supporters Club, 31 July 2004, Retrieved 18 April 2011. He was airlifted to an Athens hospital and a nine-hour operation was required to save his arm.Fuller, M., The Age, \\"Bowyer now Blue in guernsey only\\", 28 April 2005, Retrieved 18 April 2010. Upon his return, Bowyer was able to work through his depression. He took more time off for travel in 2003, and Hawthorn co-operatively delisted him to assist him. In his time away, as he overcame his depression, Bowyer became involved in Beyond Blue, the national depression initiative. He made a return to the AFL in 2004 when Carlton picked him up with the 63rd selection of the 2003 Draft. Carlton used Bowyer in a defensive capacity and he put together 20 games in two seasons. His efforts for Carlton's , the Northern Bullants, in 2005 were good enough to win him the Laurie Hill Trophy as club best and fairest. However, late in the season he sustained a vertebra injury, and retired from playing at the end of the season.Blueseum – Glen Bowyer, Retrieved 18 April 2011.

This phenomenon began in the second half of the 2000s, when a large number of people from Africa entered Israel, mainly through the fenced border between Israel and Egypt. According to the data of the Israeli Interior Ministry, 26,635 people arrived illegally in this way by July 2010, and over 55,000 by January 2012. In an attempt to curb the influx,Butcher, Tim. Sharon presses for fence across Sinai, Daily Telegraph, 7 December 2005. Israel constructed the Egypt–Israel barrier, which was completed in December 2013.Israel Completes 245 Mile, NIS 1.6 Billion Security Fence Along Sinai Border with Egypt Algemeiner, 4 December 2013 2:58 PM As of January 2018, according to the Population and Immigration Authority (PIBA) there were 37,288 African migrants in Israel, not including children born to migrants in Israel. Most African migrants are regarded to be legitimate asylum seekers by human rights organizations, but the Israeli government says most of them are job seeking work-migrants.African migrants reel as Israeli law cuts into their salaries Many of the migrants seek asylum status under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Citizens of Eritrea and Sudan cannot be forcibly deported from Israel. Under international law, Eritrea citizens (who, since 2009, form the majority of the undocumented workers in Israel) cannot be deported due to the opinion of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that Eritrea has a difficult internal situation and a forced recruitment and therefore the Eritrean immigrants are defined as a \\"temporary humanitarian protection group\\". Israeli authorities have stated that they could not deport Sudanese directly back to Sudan because Israel has no diplomatic ties to Sudan. Accordingly, the Israeli authorities grant temporary residence through \\"conditional release permits\\" which must be renewed every one to four months, depending on the discretion of the individual immigration official. Various authorities in Israel estimate that 80–90% of the undocumented workers live primarily in two centers: more than 60% in Tel Aviv and more than 20% Eilat, with a few in Ashdod, Jerusalem and Arad.  Legal status  According to the government, the majority of the migrants are seeking economic opportunity. This is not the case among Israel's allies such as the United States, where the vast majority of Eritrean and Sudanese applicants are accepted as refugees. Once in Israel, African migrants have sought refugee status for fleeing forced, open-ended conscription in Eritrea or ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region of Sudan, but the government of Israel maintains that these areas merely have a poor human rights record, which does not automatically entitle one to asylum. To qualify, applicants must establish that they face the risk of personal harm or persecution if they return to their country. The Interior Ministry has failed to review the vast majority of asylum requests. Most migrants request refugee status after arriving in Israel, in accordance with the United Nations's Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Israel does not review the status of the individual immigrants originating from Eritrea or Sudan, who constitute about 83% of the total people coming to Israel across the Egyptian border, and instead automatically grants them a \\"temporary protection group\\" status. This status allows these people to have temporary residence right within Israel, which must be renew every 3 months; usually this also means that they would be eligible for a work permit in Israel. In the past Israel also granted an automatic \\"temporary protection group\\" status to all citizens of the Ivory Coast and South Sudan, although since then the validity of this status has expired. Regarding the other asylum requests filed by citizens of other countries and examined individually, the Interior Ministry stated that only a fraction of them were actually eligible for refugee status. History The Israeli government originally tolerated the new arrivals from Africa. It allowed their entry and many migrants found menial jobs in hotels and restaurants. But after their numbers swelled, concerns were raised. In the second half of the 2000s, there was a significant increase in the number of undocumented workers who immigrated from Africa to Israel by crossing the Egyptian border. In 2006 about 1,000 undocumented workers were detained; in 2007 about 5,000 were detained; in 2008 about 8,700 were detained; and in 2009 about 5,000 were detained. In the first half of 2010 the migration rate even further increased in the first seven months when over 8,000 undocumented workers were caught. The total number of undocumented workers is clearly greater than these figures, because many were not apprehended. The early wave of undocumented workers came mainly from Sudan, while in 2009 the majority of the immigrants were from Eritrea. In early May 2010, it was estimated that 24,339 undocumented workers resided in Israel, of whom the number of Sudanese and Eritrean refugees who are not deportable under international law was 18,959: 5,649 Sudanese and 13,310 Eritreans. 16,766 of them received a special visa (ס 2א 5) granted to illegal immigrants who are non-deportable asylum seekers. Officially, the visa allows them only to stay in the country, but in practice the state also allows the refugees to work and avoids imposing fines on the Israeli employers who employ them. This special visa requires renewal every three months. The Israeli immigration police patrols the neighborhoods of south Tel Aviv regularly and arrests asylum seekers who do not carry a valid visa; the punishment can be one to three months in prison. 141 immigrants, mostly from Ethiopia, received refugee status. According to the IDF's Operations Division in 2008, most of the countries from where the illegal immigrants came are (in descending order): Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Most of the illegal immigrants (85%) were men. Most migrants initially arrive in Egypt, and then pay sums of up to twenty thousand dollars for Bedouin smugglers to transfer them to the border between Egypt and Israel. There have been cases of abuse against male and female migrants committed by the Bedouin smugglers, including rape, kidnapping for ransom, trafficking, and murder. Both male and female migrants have also reported many cases of sexual and physical assault, rape, and the forced removal of bodily organs (kidneys, for example). Another danger for the migrants includes the Egyptian army policy shooting at them in order to prevent crossing the Egypt/Israel border. To contain the illegal entry of persons, construction of the Egypt–Israel barrier commenced in 2012 and was completed in 2015. 9,570 citizens of various African countries entered Israel illegally in the first half of 2012, while only 34 did the same in the first six months of 2013, after construction of the main section of the barrier was completed.New Data Shows 99% Drop in Illegal Entry, Arutz Sheva. 2 July 201399.6% Drop in the Number of Infiltrators Entering Israel Due to Government Action , Israeli Prime Minister official website. 1 July 2013Israel to trade arms for migrants with African countries, Ynetnews.com. 9 July 2013 After the entire fence was completed, the number of migrant crossings had dropped to 16 in 2016.ISRAEL COMPLETES HEIGHTENED EGYPT BORDER FENCE  Demographics  As of April 2012, 59,858 illegal immigrants who were never imprisoned in detention facilities have illegally entered into Israel (in August 2010 the number of the imprisoned was 1,900). Several thousand of them did not end up staying in the country. The Israeli department of immigration does not keep continuous supervision over their place of residence but, according to estimates based on data from the Israeli police, the local authorities and the aid organizations, approximately 34,000 illegal immigrants originated from Eritrea, about 15,000 originated from Sudan and 10,000 originated from other countries. The Israeli Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration does not keep detailed documentation regarding their place of residence, but according to estimates from 2011, which are based on data from the Israeli police, the local authorities and the NGOs, circa 15,000–17,000 illegal immigrants lived in Tel Aviv (mainly in southern Tel Aviv, though the number also includes illegal immigrants living in Bat Yam and Bnei Brak) and 4,000–8,000 living in Eilat. While the estimates in Ashdod range from 1,500 to 2,000 illegal immigrants, in Jerusalem range from 1,000 to 8,000 illegal immigrants, and in Arad range from 400 to 600 illegal immigrants. As of 2017, only 39,274 of those who entered the country remain. Criminal activity In December 2010, Police commissioner Dudi Cohen stated that despite a decline in robberies in the general population, there was a dramatic increase in this type of crime among the illegal immigrants. According to the research department of the Israel Police and Israel's foreign immigrants' crime is characterized by predominantly sectoral internal crime, in which a gun is not reported, and illegal immigrants generally have no interest in complaining to the police. Due to an increase in criminal acts and the feeling of insecurity among the residents of southern Tel Aviv, the Israeli police established a new station near the New central bus station and the Shapira neighborhood. The station includes approximately 100 police officers and is expected to accommodate about 150 police officers. According to the data of the Israeli Police, which was presented to the Knesset in March 2012, from 2007 there was a steady increase in the involvement in crime of the illegal immigrants, both due to the significant increase in their numbers and for various other reasons. In 2011, 1,200 criminal cases were opened against illegal immigrants from Africa, half of them in the Tel Aviv district. This is an increase of 54% in comparison to the previous year. http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-4204802,00.html Massive protests supporting the immigrants and their remaining in Israel have taken place simultaneous with other Israelis calling for their deportation. Crime is a major factor for residents who call for the government to repatriate the migrants. Examples include the murder of 68-year-old Esther Galili who was beaten to death near her South Tel Aviv home in 2010 by a drunken Sudanese migrant. Her daughter Corine Galili is now an activist with the Residents of Southern Tel Aviv council. Another example includes the rape of 83-year-old Ester Nahman by a 17-year-old Eritrean migrant in 2013. There has also been a concern of crimes committed by migrants against migrants including rape and murder. According to David Filo, the police commander in charge of the district that includes south Tel Aviv, the local police station went from only four or five officers before the wave of immigrants, to more than 200 as of 2017 on duty around the clock due to the increase in crime. He stated that statistics indicate most of the crimes reported are between immigrants and include theft, drug sales and domestic violence. Israeli police reported experiencing difficulties dealing with criminal cases involving illegal African immigrants due to the lack of interpreters proficient in the Tigrinya language spoken in Eritrea. The Israeli legal system has encountered a similar problems. In her ruling on the Holot \\"open detention facility\\", Israeli Supreme Court justice Edna Arbel stated that whereas studies that show the level of crime committed by infiltrators is lower than in society in general, the distress of residents of South Tel Aviv should not be underestimated. Handling of asylum seekers The entrance to Holot immigration detention center, Negev desert, Israel. In 2010, Israel began building a barrier along sections of its border with Egypt to curb the influx of refugees from African countries. Construction was completed in January 2013. 230 km of fence have been built. While 9,570 citizens of various African countries entered Israel illegally in the first half of 2012, only 34 did the same in the first six months of 2013, after construction of the barrier was completed. It represents a decrease of over 99%. Israel also began deporting thousands of illegal immigrants residing in the country. In 2017 Israel announced its intent to deport thousands of illegal immigrants by March 2018. African migrants are told to choose between returning to their home countries or being sent to third world countries, that are rumored to be Rwanda and Uganda. The Israeli Knesset announced that illegal immigrants who do not leave by March 2018 will be jailed until they leave Israel. In 2012, the Knesset passed an \\"anti- infiltration law.\\" Advocates like MK Michal Rozin visited Saharonim and said that migrants received adequate food and medical care and were not mistreated, but said that sending migrants there was inhumane. However, conditions for many refugees elsewhere in the region are worse. After the Supreme Court of Israel declared that the long-term custody of migrants in Sahronim was unconstitutional, the government opened Holot, an open detention center, in December 2013. The 1,800 residents at Holot are allowed to leave but are required to sign in once a day and return for an evening curfew. Israeli courts temporarily cancelled the summonses of African migrants to the Holot facility, and froze others until appeals can be heard against them. Judges also criticized the summons process, saying there exist fundamental problems, including the failure to examine individual circumstances and the lack of hearings for illegal immigrants. The government stated that hearings were not necessary because ordering the migrants to travel to Holot does not violate their human rights. On 22 September 2014, the High Court struck down the anti- infiltration law (under which the Holot facility operated) and ordered the state to close Holot within 90 days. The court addressed two measures: (1) whether to limit the detention of migrants, and (2) whether to close Holot. On both measures, the court sided with the petitioners (the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, ASSAF, Kav LaOved, Physicians for Human Rights–Israel, and Amnesty International–Israel). The ruling said that conditions at the facility were an \\"unbearable violation of [their] basic rights, first and foremost the right to freedom and the right to dignity\\". Illegal migrants can no longer be detained for up to a year without trial, however detention continues within legal boundaries. The detentions in Holot have continued, with illegal immigrants being detained for a year and then being prevented from living in Tel Aviv and Eilat upon their release. In November 2017, the Israeli government announced that it would be closing the Holot Detention Center within four months. A law passed in 2017 required that employers impose a 20 per cent deduction on the wages of workers who entered the country illegally from Egypt. The deducted money is deposited in a fund along with an employer paid tax of 16 per cent. This money is accessible to workers only when they leave Israel. In April 2018, Israel reached an agreement with the United Nations to expel around 16,000 African migrants to Western countries in exchange for granting temporary residency in Israel to the same number. Shortly after, however, the deal was cancelled by the Israeli government. Aid organizations Israel has a number of organizations focused legal aid, including the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, ASSAF, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, African Refugees Development Center and Association for Civil Rights in Israel. The secular Jewish organization Bina, located in south Tel Aviv, has helped asylum seekers as well as Israeli citizens understand refugee rights, and has undertaken advocacy and educational activities including frequent trips for Israelis to visit the Holot Detention Center. Most of these organization are funded by the New Israel Fund. Relief organizations have been involved in discussions held in Knesset committees on this issue and have submitted a petition against the measures the state has taken to put a halt to the phenomenon of immigration. unitaf creates early- childhood programs for refugee and stateless children living in Israel; the President of the board is Aliza Olmert Response in Israel Israel was founded in the wake of the Holocaust and has provided refuge to Jews fleeing oppression around the world. On one hand, many Israelis feel Israel has a special responsibility to assist refugees in such dire conditions. Israeli reaction to African migrants has been mixed. In 2010, Israelis protested the construction of the Holot detention facility built to detain illegal immigrants, stating that its construction goes against Human Rights values. At the same time, residents of South Tel Aviv demonstrated against the presence of foreigners living in their communities. In 2012, nearly 1,000 Israelis, mostly from neighborhoods in South Tel Aviv staged a protest against illegal immigrants, joined by Member of Knesset Miri Regev, they asked the government for deportation and expulsion of migrants from Africa. Regev stated \\"the Sudanese were a cancer in our body.\\" This protest led to destruction of property and businesses owned by Sudanese and Eritrean people as well as violence. In 2015, an immigrant from Eritrea, Habtom Zarhum, was beaten to death by a mob after being misidentified as the perpetrator in a terrorist attack at the Beersheva bus station. Many Israelis have continued to show their support over the years for the community. Refugee Seders have been held each year during the Jewish holiday of Passover. Support is also demonstrated through the work of non-profit organizations, including Kav LaOved (Worker's Hotline), ARDC, ASSAF. In late 2017, early 2018, North American Jewish organizations joined with Israeli NGOs to decry Israel's decision to close Holot and deport asylum seekers. Israeli demographer Arnon Soffer claims that from a security perspective, the migrants may serve as informant or as operatives of terrorist organizations. Socially, he claims that they are contributing to congestion in the cities and a rise in crime. From the demographic perspective, he perceives them as a demographic threat to the Jewish majority. According to Sofer, failing to stop the illegal immigration waves at an early stage will only lead to much larger waves in the future. Israeli economic commentator Nehemiah Shtrasler estimated that illegal immigrants take the places of weaker manual workers, causing loss of jobs and a reduction in the wages. He also claimed that they burden the health care, welfare and education systems. \\"We would never be able to raise the standard of living of the needy and reduce the gaps, if we keep on absorbing more and more destitute people.\\" Israeli MK Ya'akov Katz, who headed the government committee on issue of illegal asylum seekers, proposed establishing a city near the Egyptian border where the immigrants would live until deportation. In December 2011, Mayor of Tel Aviv Ron Huldai demanded that the government take \\"immediate emergency action.\\" In mid-2010, a demonstration was held in Eilat against the inaction of the Israeli government. Residents claimed that they were afraid to walk outside at night in certain neighborhoods. In the Shapira and Kiryat Shalom neighborhoods in southern Tel Aviv a number of real estate agents stated that they would not rent apartments to illegal immigrants. On 23 May 2012 a demonstration of over a thousand people was held in the Hatikva Quarter. Miri Regev, Danny Danon, Ronit Tirosh and Michael Ben-Ari spoke. speeches. Later on the protest turned violent. President Shimon Peres issued a condemnation of the violent words and actions against the African migrant workers, calling to refrain from racism and incitement, saying: \\"Hatred of foreigners contradicts the fundamental principles of Judaism. I am well aware of the difficulties faced by the residents of south Tel Aviv [and other similar areas], but violence is not the solution.\\" In a Channel 2 interview in November 2013, Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai scoffed at government policy, saying, \\"Can 50,000 people be a demographic threat? That's a mockery. ... The truth is they will remain here. They are human beings and I must take care of them.\\" Regular demonstrations and rallies supporting the refugees have also been held. On 28 December 2013 thousands have protested in Tel Aviv against detention of asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea. The protesters, marched from Levinsky Park in South Tel Aviv to city center, decrying the detention without trial of African refugees in the Saharonim and Holot detention facilities. Migrants have reportedly said to fear for their life should they return to their home countries.Itay Blumenthal, TA: Thousands protest against detention of asylum seekers, YNetNews, 28 December 2013, Retrieved 29 December 2013 On 15 January 2014, the Knesset Committee on Foreign Workers met to discuss the Immigration and Border Authority policy and its impact on the business sector. African migrants were present and participated in the Knesset meeting. They were supported by MK Michal Rozin of Meretz. In April 2014, activists organized a Passover seder with asylum seekers at the Holot facility to recall the Passover story and call attention to the plight of the migrants. Similar seders were held in support of the migrants in Tel Aviv and Washington. Similar events took place in 2015 and 2016.  International response  The Maryland-based refugee rights organization HIAS, whose Israeli branch has been actively assisting African asylum seekers, has vocally opposed the Israeli government's policy toward the asylum seekers and has called on Israel to evaluate their refugee status claims in accordance with international law. The Los Angeles-based organization StandWithUs, whose mission is \\"supporting Israel around the world – through education and fighting anti-Semitism\\", states that \\"most of the migrants came to Israel seeking work opportunities, not as refugees escaping war\\"; as StandWithUs elaborates, \\"unlike refugees who are fleeing war or persecution, economic migrants leave their countries in search of better work opportunities.\\" However, globally, national authorities have found asylum seekers from Eritrea deserving of refugee status in 84% of applications, and have granted refugee status to Sudanese asylum seekers 56% of the time, whereas Israel has only granted 1% of asylum petitions from these asylum seekers. Mandatory lifetime conscription is among the human-rights abuses in Eritrea from which they may be fleeing. The Rabbinical Assembly, the clergy organization of Conservative Judaism, passed a resolution in 2016 stating that \\"Israel’s Ministry of the Interior has been very reluctant to grant refugee status to bona fide asylum seekers\\" and calling on Israel to do so. The rabbinic human-rights organization T’ruah, based in New York, has made it a priority to encourage Israel to evaluate all asylum seekers' claims fairly.

History The town of California Junction traces its origins to the Yazoo post office and the ill-fated towns of Cincinnati and Parrish City, which were founded in Cincinnati township during the later half of the 1850s. Yazoo Landing was a ferry crossing on the Missouri River where the Blair Bridge now stands. The present settlement was established in 1880, after the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad was built. John I. Blair, the railroad tycoon, believed that this would be an important hub for passengers heading west, and gave the town its current name. In 1883, the name of the town was changed to \\"California\\" to avoid confusion with Columbia Junction; it retained this name as of 1915. In 1879, California Junction had a population of 200 people. In 1903, the California Grain and Lumber Company was organized in California Junction. By 1915, there was also a town hall, high school, general store, blacksmith shop, post office, two churches, and a train station.

Coulthard, a prominent landowner, businessman, and farmer from California Junction. No oil was obtained from the site, but the capped well leaks water to this day. A marshy area surrounding the well remains as a local landmark, which is visible about 160 yards north of town on Fremont Ave., about 30 yards west of the roadway. Location of H. R.
