Designed by Diana Balmori, the Atrium was originally constructed in 1988, and substantially rebuilt in 2002, after it was damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. The Atrium houses various plants, trees and flowers, and shops. The rear of the building opens onto the World Financial Center Plaza and the North Cove Yacht Harbor on the Hudson River. History Interior of the Winter Garden Atrium in 2017 The Winter Garden Atrium, along with the rest of the World Financial Center, was designed by architect C√©sar Pelli in 1985. Completed in 1988 at a cost of $60 million, the Atrium was originally connected to the World Trade Center via a pedestrian bridge that spanned West Street. The Atrium was severely damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks as almost all the glass panes were blown out by the dust clouds and debris caused by the collapse of the World Trade Center, but was rebuilt during the first year of the Financial Center's recovery. Reconstruction of the Winter Garden required 2,000 panes of glass, 60,000 square feet (5,400 m¬≤) of marble flooring and stairs, and sixteen Washingtonia robusta palm trees at a cost of $50 million. Reopened on September 17, 2002, the Winter Garden was the first major structure to be completely restored following the attacks. President George W. Bush was present at the reopening ceremony. The pedestrian bridge was destroyed in the same attacks and was replaced by windows facing the former site of the World Trade Center. Exhibits The damaged Winter Garden after the 9/11 attacks Since its construction, the Winter Garden Atrium has hosted concerts and symphonies as part of the World Financial Center Series. Upon its reopening in 2002, the atrium held ballets, concerts, a performance by the Big Apple Circus, and a production of The Downtown Messiah, a modern interpretation of Handel's classical oratorio, directed by Richard Barone. In the spring of 2003, an exhibit documenting the recovery process of the World Trade Center was installed by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the Winter Garden. The exhibit included early designs of Libeskind's Freedom Tower. Later that year, the eight finalists in the competition for the new buildings had their designs unveiled and displayed in the atrium. The Winter Garden continues to serve as a venue for art exhibits, music, and shows, as well as hosting movie screenings during the TriBeCa Film Festival.

It was created in the city of Ica, approximately south of the capital, Lima. The Saint Aloysius Gonzaga National University is established due to concerns of the town of Ica, that it demanded an institution of superior studies for those that had professional aspirations. On December 20, 1955, after many unexpected delays, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga created the \\"National University of Ica\\", by law N¬∫12495. It was managed by the then senator of Ica, Don Felix Temistocles Rocha Rebatta, during the Government of General Manuel Odr√≠a; producing in the town of Ica one of his greater points of pride. After five years, the town felt offended, since the university did not carry out its intentions, making excuses of budgetary character, and even a proposal for the cancellation of the law N¬∫21495 on the part of the House of Representatives. Many groups participated in the fight to make the operation of the University a reality, such as the Departmental Civic Front of Ica, the Union of Primary Teachers of Ica, the Association of Ex-Sanluisanos of the Nocturnal one, Bigheaded the V√≠ctor Rock Pacheco and the Committee Pro Operation. Additionally, they were joined by the Association of Parents of Family of the G.U.E. \\"San Luis Gonzaga\\", the Junior Camera, the Rotary Club, the Social Union of Ica, the Club of Lions, etc. After many requests and misfortunes, on February 18, 1961, a historical and significant date for the town of Ica, the Organizing Commission of the University in the premises of the library of the G.U.E formed. \\"San Luis Gonzaga\\", presided over by the Dr. Manuel Beltroy, and integrated by Luis Felipe Ricci Boh√≥rquez, Oscar Escate Fields, Otto Cockburn Alvarado, Atilio Nieri Boggiano, Carlos Luj√°n Castillo and Lorenzo Pezzia Assereto; officially opened for operation, a fact that made possible by means of Ministerial Resolution N¬∫ 137 on the 18 of February 1961.

The University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, was established in 1839. This later expanded to the statewide University of Missouri System. Founding and early years MU was founded in 1839 as part of the Geyer Act to establish a state land- grant university, the first west of the Mississippi River. The year of its founding the citizens of Columbia and Boone County pledged $117,921 in cash and land to beat out five other mid-Missouri counties for the location of the state university. The land on which the university was eventually constructed was just south of Columbia's downtown and owned by James S. Rollins, who is known as the \\"father of the university.\\" It was the first university in Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase and was designed in part upon Thomas Jefferson's original plans for the University of Virginia. Because of this, the original tombstone of Thomas Jefferson was given to MU by Jefferson's heirs in July 1883. In 1849 the first courses in civil engineering west of the Mississippi River were taught at MU.http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/mu- history.php The first department of art was named after the famous Missouri artist George Caleb Bingham. The College of Education was opened in 1867 and admitted the first female students in 1868. The entire university was open to female enrollment by 1871. In 1862 while in the midst of the Civil War, the Board of Curators suspended operations for the university. Academic Hall was occupied by Union troops, the president's house was used by Federal officers and the normal school, forerunner to the College of Education, became an army hospital. It was during this time that the residents of Columbia and defenders of the city became notoriously known as the \\"fighting tigers of Columbia\\" due to their insistent fighting to keep the Confederate bushwackers away from the city and university. In 1890 one alumnus suggested the university's newly formed football team be called the \\"Tigers\\" out of respect for those who fought to defend Columbia. Early growth The most dramatic change occurred in 1870 when the School of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts was established as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts which gave the college an endowment of of federal land to \\"teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.\\" The land grant was based on 30,000 acres for each of Missouri's 2 senators and 9 state representatives at the time. There was an intense debate in the state on whether to use the endowment for the existing school or build a new school elsewhere (notably Springfield, Missouri). Rollins prevailed in establishing the school in the Columbia and while at the same time establishing an off-site department called the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy at Rolla, Missouri in the Southeast Missouri Lead District that reported to Columbia where The College of Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources was established. The Rolla campus (which had offered a higher bid that Iron County, Missouri) would remain a department reporting to Columbia until 1964 when the University of Missouri System was established. In 1888 the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station opened. This grew to encompass ten centers and research farms around Mid-Missouri. MU soon added schools of law and medicine. The burning of Academic Hall On January 9, 1892, Academic Hall, the institution's main building, fell victim to a disastrous fire rumored to have been caused by the first electric light bulb west of the Mississippi River. The fire completely gutted the building, leaving little more than six stone Ionic columns standing. After the fire, there was a campaign to move the University to Sedalia, however the town of Columbia was able to rally against the move. But as a token of gratitude, Sedalia received the rights to host the Missouri State Fair in exchange. The columns, which still stand today, became a symbol of the campus and form the center of Francis Quadrangle, the oldest part of campus. Also in the quadrangle, and often referred to as its centerpiece, is Jesse Hall. Built in 1895, Jesse Hall was formerly known as New Academic Hall. Today, Jesse Hall is home to many administrative offices of the university and to Jesse Auditorium. The area of campus around the quadrangle, where the buildings are built of red brick, is known as \\"red campus.\\" East of the quadrangle, many buildings were built in 1913 and 1914 of white limestone. This section is known as \\"white campus.\\" Early 20th century Journalist Marguerite Martyn visited the campus in 1910 and sketched these two fashionable students with the architectural columns behind them. At that time, the campus was known as Missouri State University. In 1908 the world's first journalism school was opened at MU. It became notable for its \\"Missouri Method\\" of teaching. In 1911, MU held the first Homecoming at the football game between MU and the University of Kansas. The University of Missouri School of Music was founded in 1917 as the Department of Music. After World War II universities around the country grew at an extraordinary pace and MU was no exception. This was due, in part, to the G.I. Bill which allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government. It was also during this time that the nickname \\"Mizzou\\" was first used. The usage of the term \\"Mizzou\\" was first recorded in a campus yell that used the phrase \\"Mizzou, Rah, Rah.\\" The commonly accepted origin is that the word is a shortened version of the University's (then-known as the Missouri State University) initials, MSU. When said quickly the initials can be morphed into the affectionate nickname: Mizzou. The name stuck and now is commonly used interchangeably among students, alumni and the residents of Columbia with the newer initials, MU.  From segregation to integration  Events at the University of Missouri were instrumental in the desegregation of universities and schools nationwide. In 1935, four graduates of Lincoln University‚Äîa traditionally black school about 30 miles (50 km) away in Jefferson City, Missouri‚Äîwere denied admission to MU's graduate school. One of the students, Lloyd L. Gaines, brought his case to the United States Supreme Court. On December 12, 1938, in the landmark 6‚Äì2 decision, Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, the court ordered the state of Missouri to admit Gaines to MU's law school or provide a facility of equal stature. Gaines, however, disappeared in Chicago on March 19, 1939 under mysterious circumstances. The University granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006.MU awards law degree to kin of rights pioneer Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950, when the university was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were not offered at Lincoln University. Modern Mizzou In 1962, the University of Missouri became the \\"University of Missouri‚ÄìColumbia,\\" the flagship campus of the newly created University of Missouri System, with additional campuses in Rolla, Kansas City, and St. Louis. Today the Columbia campus ranks number one among institutions in the Association of American Universities for growth in federally funded research over the last ten years. Mizzou is a member of the Southeastern Conference and is the only school in the state with all of its sports in the NCAA Division I-A, the nations highest level of college sports. MU has over a quarter million living alumni worldwide. In 1970, students upset with the killing of four students at Kent State University stormed Chancellor Schwada's office and, for a short time, took over campus. Classes were dismissed and staff were sent home. It was around this same time that Peace Park was dedicated near the journalism school as a permanent monument for the promotion of peace and remembrance. In 1978, Barbara Uehling became MU's third chancellor and the first woman to lead a major state university in the country. Following the 2015 University of Missouri protests, the chancellor and System president resigned, amid racial complaints by students. Presidents and chancellors Each campus of the University of Missouri System is led by a chancellor, who reports to the president of the UM System. Prior to the formation of the system in 1963, the Columbia campus and its offshoot in Rolla were led directly by the president and the position of chancellor did not exist.

Note that the lineage of the \\"7th Regiment of Artillery\\" constituted 8 March 1898 is carried by the 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment. World War I The regiment was constituted on 1 July 1916 in the Regular Army as the 7th Field Artillery. It was organized on 15 July 1916 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. On 8 June 1917 it was assigned to the First Expeditionary Division, which was later designated as the 1st Division as part of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War I. World War II 7th Field Artillery Regiment participated in the amphibious assault landing in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. After fighting across North Africa, the regiment participated in 1st Infantry Division's assault of Omaha Beach. Vietnam War On 20 January 1964 the unit was redesignated the 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division. The redesignation included a new design for the unit's distinctive unit insignia (DUI) to an \\"artillery red\\" square shield divided by a silver band running from the top right corner to the bottom left corner (as the wearer sees it). In the upper division of the shield appears three silver crescent moons, while the lower division holds seven silver crosslets alluding to the numerical designation of the battalion. The primary charge of the shield however is the three large \\"artillery red\\" arrow heads or pheons that rest upon the silver band. It is from these three pheons that the nickname for the battalion \\"the Pheons\\" is derived. The unit's motto was shortened to \\"Nunquam Fractum\\" (Never Broken) written in silver on an \\"artillery red\\" scroll beneath the shield. The unit would carry this designation throughout its tour of Vietnam from 25 June 1965, to 19 March 1970. On 23 June 1965, Private First Class Gerold Worster arrived by plane in Saigon, in the Republic of Vietnam. Not only was Gerold the first soldier from the 1st Infantry Division, known as the \\"Big Red One\\", he was also the first member of the 7th Artillery to set foot on Vietnamese soil. Even as he climbed from the plane, his comrades were loading aboard the USNS General W. H. Gordon for the trip to Vietnam. On 12 July, Charlie Battery of the 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery made landfall at Cam Ranh Bay, part of a taskforce with the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division. This force was the first tactical US Army unit to be deployed in the Republic of Vietnam directly from the continental United States. After returning from Vietnam in March 1970, the 7th Artillery was redesignated the 7th Field Artillery once again on 1 September 1971. The unit insignia was redesigned by replacing the squared shield with a more rounded one, eliminating the three pheons on the bend of the shield, and replacing the seven crosslets with seven blossoms of the Texas bluebonnet, alluding not only to the unit's number, but its birthplace as well. The motto \\"Nunquam Fractum\\" was replaced with \\"Nunquam Aerumna Nec Proelio Fractum\\" (never broken by hardship or battle). During its Vietnam tour the 105mm howitzers of the 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery fired more than 1,250.000 rounds in its 55 continuous months of combat while earning 11 new battle honors. With the change of the unit insignia and the loss of the pheons from the shield, the 7th Artillery's Vietnam nickname of \\"Pheons\\" was also lost.

He lived from 1854 to 1922. He along with other activists were instrumental in the revival of native traditions in Sri Lanka that had been long dormant during the previous 400 years of colonial rule by various European powers.Muttukumaraswamipillai, E: \\"Kumaraswamy pulavar varalaru\\", page 3. pulavaragam Press Chunnakam, 1970 Early life Chunnakam Kumaraswamy Pulavar was born to Ampalavanar and Chithamparammai on January 18, 1854 as only son, among two daughters. When the Pulavar was 5, he started studying Tamil under Om Namasivaya Desikar and also started studying at Mallakam English School. At the age of 8 he started learning Tamil literature from Murukasu Panditar. Encouraged by Arumuga Navalar, a friend of his great uncle Muttukumara Kavirajar, Pulavar started learning Sanskrit literature from a close relative, Naganatha Panditar from the age of 9. In 1878 Rao Bhahadur C. W. Thamotharampillai asked the Pulavar to teach at his Saivapracasa Tamil School at Elalai, and two years later Pulavar was promoted to be the principal of the school.John H. Martyn, E: \\"Notes on Jaffna, Chronological, Historical, Biographical \\", page 341. American Ceylon Press Tellippalai Ceylon, 1923 He was there for 22 years and earned high recognition for his hard work. During this time Pulavar wrote a number of research papers on ancient Tamil literature. He also wrote and published several articles on greatness of the Hindu Saiva religion to counter the insulting articles published by Christian clergy at that time in Jaffna and Tamil Nadu. In 1892 he married Chinnachiammai, daughter of Mylvahanam of Kantharodai / Uduvil. Contributions When in 1896 Pulavar became a member of a committee, which was formed to oversee the reconstruction of the Naguleswaram temple in Kƒ´rimalai which was destroyed by the Portuguese colonials in 1621, he also composed the Oonjel songs on Lord Shiva of Naguleswaram temple. In 1900 Jaffna Tamil Sangam was established by Kailasa Pillai, with the Pulavar as the chief examiner and member of the scholarly panel. In 1902 Pulavar was appointed as the head master of Arumuga Navalar‚Äôs Saivapirahasa Tamil School in Vannarpannai. Eventually he gained much recognition for his eminence. In 1902 Madurai Tamil Sangam was established in Tamil Nadu by Zemeendar Panditurai Devar and Ramanathapuram King Rajarajeswara Sethupathi. Pulavar was one of the first Tamil scholars invited to be examiner of the panel of Tamil scholars, a position held by him for the next 20 years.S Arumugam, E: \\"Dictionary of Biography of the Tamils of Ceylon \\", page 88. London UK, Jan 1997 ;Scholarly contributions Pulavar contributed research articles regularly to journals and composed many poetic compositions and works in prose among which some areStatue of Kumaraswamy Pulavar in Chunnakam Library Tamil Pulavar Charithram (History of Tamil poets), Ilakkiya Sol Aharathy (Dictionary of classical terms), Neethi Neri Vilakkam (An explanation of the judicial process), Megathootha Karikai and Raguvamsa Charitha Amirtham (Both religious works). Besides the above, he also published some of the Tamil classics, with his explanatory notes and comments. He was also a Sanskrit scholar. Pulavar died due to illness on March 9, 1922. He had two sons Ambalavanapillai & Muttukumaraswamipillai, who were also able scholars, and a daughter Visalachiyammai.

Victorian decorative arts refers to the style of decorative arts during the Victorian era. Victorian design is widely viewed as having indulged in a grand excess of ornament. The Victorian era is known for its interpretation and eclectic revival of historic styles mixed with the introduction of middle east and Asian influences in furniture, fittings, and interior decoration. The Arts and Crafts movement, the aesthetic movement, Anglo-Japanese style, and Art Nouveau style have their beginnings in the late Victorian era and gothic period. Architecture The Commandant drawing room, Port Arthur, Tasmania. Interior decoration and design Interior decoration and interior design of the Victorian era are noted for orderliness and ornamentation. A house from this period was idealistically divided in rooms, with public and private space carefully separated. The parlour was the most important room in a home and was the showcase for the homeowners where guests were entertained. A bare room was considered to be in poor taste, so every surface was filled with objects that reflected the owner's interests and aspirations. The dining room was the second-most important room in the house. The sideboard was most often the focal point of the dining room and very ornately decorated.

Hallways that were in the entry hall and the stair halls were painted a somber gray so as not to compete with the surrounding rooms. Most people marbleized the walls or the woodwork. Also on walls it was common to score into wet plaster to make it resemble blocks of stone. Finishes that were either marbleized or grained were frequently found on doors and woodwork. \\"Graining\\" was meant to imitate woods of higher quality that were more difficult to work. There were specific rules for interior color choice and placement. The theory of ‚Äúharmony by analogy‚Äù was to use the colors that lay next to each other on the color wheel. And the second was the ‚Äúharmony by contrast‚Äù that was to use the colors that were opposite of one another on the color wheel. There was a favored tripartite wall that included a dado or wainscoting at the bottom, a field in the middle and a frieze or cornice at the top. This was popular into the 20th century. Frederick Walton who created linoleum in 1863 created the process for embossing semi-liquid linseed oil, backed with waterproofed paper or canvas. It was called Lincrusta and was applied much like wallpaper. This process made it easy to then go over the oil and make it resemble wood or different types of leather. On the ceilings that were 8‚Äì14 feet the color was tinted three shades lighter than the color that was on the walls and usually had a high quality of ornamentation because decorated ceilings were favored. Furniture There was not one dominant style of furniture in the Victorian period. Designers rather used and modified many styles taken from various time periods in history like Gothic, Tudor, Elizabethan, English Rococo, Neoclassical and others. The Gothic and Rococo revival style were the most common styles to be seen in furniture during this time in history.

This was due to the introduction of mass production techniques and, in England, the repeal in 1836 of the Wallpaper tax introduced in 1712. Wallpaper was often made in elaborate floral patterns with primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) in the backgrounds and overprinted with colours of cream and tan. This was followed by Gothic art inspired papers in earth tones with stylized leaf and floral patterns. William Morris was one of the most influential designers of wallpaper and fabrics during the latter half of the Victorian period. Morris was inspired and used Medieval and Gothic tapestries in his work. Embossed paper were used on ceilings and friezes.

Wilde‚Äôs notion of cultural enlightenment through visual cues echoes that of Alexandre von Humboldt who maintained that imagination was not the Romantic figment of scarcity and mystery but rather something anyone could begin to develop with other methods, including organic elements in pteridomania[]. By changing one‚Äôs immediate dwelling quarters, one changed one‚Äôs mind as well[]; Wilde believed that the way forward in cosmopolitanism began with as a means eclipse the societally mundane, and that such guidance would be found not in books or classrooms, but through a lived Platonic epistemology. An aesthetic shift in the home‚Äôs Victorian decorative arts reached its highest outcome in the literal transformation of the individual into cosmopolitan, as Wilde was regarded and noted among others in his tour of America. For Wilde, however, the inner meaning of Victorian decorative arts is fourfold: one must first reconstruct one‚Äôs inside so as to grasp what is outside in terms of both living quarters and mind, whilst hearkening back to von Humboldt on the way to Plato so as to be immersed in contemporaneous cosmopolitanism, thereby in the ideal state becoming oneself admirably aesthetical.

The story revolves around a young man, Sandy, whose family is poisoned by his scheming uncles in a bid to gain the family fortune. He moves them to Walnut Manor, a neighboring convalescent home, where, with the help of the nurse Sunnie, he tries to save his family and benefit the manor's misunderstood residents. Love Among the Walnuts was first published on September 1, 1998, by Harcourt. Reviews of the work have been mostly positive, with focus on the story's style and tone. It was listed as a YALSA Best Book for Young Adults and placed third on the ranked Teens' Top Ten Books list, both in 1999. Plot Horatio Alger Huntington-Ackerman, a successful businessperson, marries Mousey Huntington-Ackerman (n√©e Malone), a striving actor, and has a child named Sandy. They move with their butler Bentley and his wife Flossie to a new country estate called Eclipse with no neighbors except the residents of Walnut Manor, a convalescent home. One evening when Sandy is a young adult, his uncles Bart and Bernie visit Eclipse. The uncles feed the family a poisoned birthday cake in an attempt to inherit the family fortune, sending everyone but Sandy and Bentley into a coma. A court ruling mandates that a doctor be present to oversee care for the comatose patients (\\"the sleepers\\"). To meet this requirement, Sandy moves them next door to Walnut Manor. There, he meets Dr. Waldemar, the director of the facility, and Sunnie Stone, a nurse hired to care for the sleepers. While Bentley researches a cure of the sleepers' comas, Sandy and Sunnie acquaint themselves with the other patients of Walnut Manor and ultimately fall in love with one another. With the help of Dr. Waldemar and the manor's residents, Sandy and Sunnie discover that Walnut Manor's patients were placed in the facility's care by their relatives, who, as Walnut Manor's board of directors, have been embezzling from the home. They expose the board of directors' misdeeds and Bentley revives the sleepers from their coma. Sandy, Sunnie, Dr. Waldemar, and the residents of Walnut Manor together thwart Bart and Bernie and send them to prison. Publication and genre Love Among the Walnuts was first published on September 1, 1998, by Harcourt. Reviewers recommended various appropriate reading ranges, including ages 12‚Äì14 and ages 10 and older. The novel has been characterized as a farce, satire, and fairy tale. Alethea K. Helbig and Agnes Regan Perkins wrote that story's exploration of familial greed was \\"in the style of a Victorian melodrama\\" and Connie Tyrrell Burns, in School Library Journal, described the story as \\"a British farce without the off-color humor\\". In their review of young adult literature that had received recognition by major literary publications between 1997 and 2001, Helbig and Perkins described Love Among the Walnuts as one of few recognized titles with humorous elements. They described the central theme of the novel as \\"the value to personal and group well-being of loving-kindness and caring\\". Reception Love Among the Walnuts received mostly positive reviews. Helbig and Perkins commented that \\"the large cast consists of individualized, complementary, and affectionately handled characters\\" and the novel's themes \\"are conveyed with skill and invention\\". Publishers Weekly praised the story for its \\"cast of offbeat characters and some punchy dialogue\\" while writing that its \\"plot will have more appeal for adults than children.\\" In The Horn Book Magazine, Anne St. John commented that Sandy's \\"emotional responses and internal struggles will ring true with teenagers who are coming of age in a time of turmoil\\". According to Elaine McGuire of Voice of Youth Advocates, Love Among the Walnuts is \\"dripping with charm but never cloying ... a fabulous book with lots of lessons about our sickeningly fast-paced '90s lifestyles.\\" Paula Rohrlick, writing in Kliatt, compared Love Among the Walnuts favorably to Ferris's later work, Once Upon a Marigold, describing both stories as \\"madcap\\". For certain reviewers, the tone and style reinforced the novel's quality. In School Library Journal, Burns commented that Love Among the Walnuts \\"is intentionally melodramatic, coincidental, improbable, and hilarious. The restrained, tongue-in-cheek tone heightens the humor of this spoof.\\" Kirkus Reviews compared the tone and plot of the story to that of a film directed by Preston Sturges or Frank Capra, describing how it \\"has an unconventional style and offbeat sense of humor that will delight readers or exhaust them, depending on their tolerance for screwball comedies.\\" Nancy Hinkel, then Associate Editor at Alfred A. Knopf and Crown Books for Young Readers, wrote that the story has \\"great writing, original ideas, and real style\\" as well as \\"a good dose of dry humor that slips past if you're not paying attention.\\" Helbig and Perkins described the novel's style as \\"fast moving, engaging, and witty.\\" Several reviews indicated reservations in recommending Love Among the Walnuts. Publishers Weekly wrote that \\"Sandy's accelerated growth from a baby in the nursery to an adult smitten with Sunny (in the space of a chapter) early on in the novel leaves young readers little to identify with.\\" Kirkus Reviews commented that \\"a financial subplot and a muddle of characters, defined by their eccentricities, clog the pacing\\" of the story while St. John in The Horn Book Magazine said that \\"some of the characters are two-dimensional\\". Love Among the Walnuts was one of 50 fiction titles selected as a 1999 Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) Best Book for Young Adults and was ranked third (after J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Louis Sachar's Holes) on YALSA's list of Teens' Top Ten Books of 1999.

Domine (ed) Wine pgs 228-229 Ullmann Publishing 2008 History According to local legend, Cabernet Franc (Breton) was brought to Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil after it was first planted at the nearby Abbey of Bourgueil. Even today the Abbey still has plantings of the grape in its garden. Located west of the city of Tours, the area of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil has seen viticulture since at least the days of the Romans. Though long overshadowed by the neighboring communes of Bourgueil and Chinon across the Loire, the area earned a reputation for the quality of its red wine as early as he Middle Ages. According to local legend, the Cabernet Franc grape was introduced to area in 1090 when it was planted in the nearby Bourgueil Abbey. Like neighboring Bourgueil, the Bretons of Brittany were a significant customer for the wines of Saint-Nicolas-de- Bourgueil and by at least the 16th century the wine from the area was being described as \\"Breton wine\\". When the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit√© (INAO) was delineating AOC regions in 1937, the commune of Saint- Nicolas-de-Bourgueil was originally grouped with the communes of Bourgueil, Benais and Restign√© under one Bourgueil AOC. But Adrien Ory, mayor of Saint- Nicolas-de-Bourgueil and one of the largest vineyard owners in the region, campaigned for a separate AOC designation for the wines from his town despite the two AOCs having essentially identical terroir and producing similar wines.James E. Wilson \\"Terroir\\" pg 238, University of California Press (1999) Eric Pfanner \\"Loire Valley Reds Come Into Their Own\\" The New York Times March 2nd, 2012 However at the time of AOC creation, the maximum allowable yields for Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil were slightly lower than for Bourgueil but subsequent revisions of AOC regulations have now made them completely the same for both AOCs. Climates and geography The coat of arms for the commune of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil which places a strong emphasis on the region's winemaking history. Located on the north \\"right bank\\" of the Loire river in the Touraine wine, Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil experiences some of the maritime climate influences from the Atlantic that the neighboring AOCs in Anjou see but with some continental climate elements as well.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 120 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The Vienne river reaches the Loire at Candes-Saint-Martin across from the AOC creating a large body of water with a resulting lake effect that tempers the climate. The AOC boundaries of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil fall within the Bourgueil AOC, northwest of the commune of Bourgueil itself on terraces of silt deposits that border the Maine-et-Loire department and Anjou wine region. Centered on the commune of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil, the vineyard soils of the AOC are not much different than the greater Bourgueil region with the exception of a slightly higher sand/limestone content (known locally as varennes). About a third of the region's vineyards are planted on Turonian chalk, a type of limestone. Viticulture and winemaking Like most of the Loire, the main red grape of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil is Cabernet franc (known locally as Breton) with Cabernet Sauvignon accounting for an increasing amount of plantings. Vineyards are densely planted with 5000 grapevines per hectare. Both Cabernet varieties are usually trained to the guyot simple system with one long cane pruned to seven or eight buds each winter. Both grapes are late- ripening varieties that require a long growing season ideally ending with an Indian summer in order to achieve full ripeness. Cabernet Franc. After harvest the grapes are destemmed and crushed with a short maceration period, often with the must warmed up to aid in extraction of color and phenolics before the wines are pressed and put into barrel. The wine almost always goes through malolactic fermentation. Some Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil producers with vineyards planted in lighter soils will produce an early maturing wine, with an even shorter maceration period and much less oak aging, that can be released as early as the summer after vintage while other examples will see 15 to 18 months of aging before being bottled.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (5th Edition) pgs 257-259 Dorling Kindersley (2011) Production and wine industry In 1998, Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil produced 53,572 hectoliters of wine (around 595,240 cases) from 929 hectares (approximately 2295 acres) of vineyards. By 2013, that number had expanded to 1,050 hectares (2,600 acres) producing around 59,000 hl (more than 655,500 cases) of wine of which 98% was red and 2% was ros√©. Many producers in Saint- Nicolas-de-Bourgueil own vineyard land in both Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil as well as the greater Bourgueil region and will often blend to make one Bourgueil AOC bottling. Among the producers who make separate Saint-Nicolas- de-Bourgueil and Bourgueil bottlings are Domaine Yannick Amirault which owns the Les Malgagnes vineyard that contains some of the oldest vines in Saint- Nicolas-de-Bourgueil. Among the producers that usually just make Saint- Nicolas-de-Bourgueil wine, Domaine Jo√´l Taluau is often considered \\"the grandfather of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil\\" as they were one of the first producers in the area to do estate bottling. Wines and AOC regulation A bottle of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil wine. According to Master of Wine Clive Coates, the wines of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil are noted for a distinctive raspberry aroma that can also have elements of pencil shavings. Compared to Chinon, the wines tend to be slightly more austere with more noticeable acidity. While very similar, Coates notes that Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil can be a little more aromatic and lighter than neighboring Bourgueil. Wine writer Tom Stevenson notes that Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil wines tend to have a little more \\"finesse\\" than Bourgueil, often requiring 5 to 6 years of aging after bottling before they are drinking at their peak and being able to age much longer. Stevenson describes the ros√©s as medium-bodied, dry and fruity. For wines to be labelled under the Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil AOC designation, the grapes must be limited to a harvest yield no greater than 55 hl/ha (approximately 3 tons/acre). The blend must be made primarily from Cabernet Franc with Cabernet Sauvignon limited to making up no more than 10% of the blend. The finished wine must contain at least 9.5% alcohol by volume.P.

Six aspiring music journalists were given the summer internships in hopes of getting a contributing editor position at Rolling Stone magazine. The contestants included six twenty-somethings that applied through a write-in contest: Krishtine de Leon is a local hip-hop magazine editor from San Francisco, CA; Peter Maiden, an Australian college student at UC Berkeley; Tika Milan, a lesbian poet and freelance journalist from Brooklyn who post-transition is now known as Tiq Milan; Russell Morse, a former juvenile delinquent turned reporter for a local San Francisco newspaper; Krystal Ann Simpson from Salinas with a love for classic rock; and Colin Stutz, a 20-year-old University of Southern California student from Oregon. Results In the last episode Jann Wenner, Joe Levy, and a team of senior editors individually reviewed all the contestants and their performance in the 2 months previous. Colin Stutz was perceived as a passionate person that looks like the rolling stone-type, however too \\"green\\" for a full-time position. Krystal Ann Simpson was the most enthusiastic about the idea for working at Rolling Stone, but was ultimately able to accomplish the least for the magazine. She was viewed as more attracted to the socialite, red carpet lifestyle, but uninterested in the actual work of being a music reporter. She was unable to produce any substance for the magazine, and was not considered as a viable candidate for the position. Russell Morse had the most raw talent as a writer, but was wildly irresponsible and showed no discipline as an employee. Failure to attend work regularly, tardiness, and disrespect for his superiors as well as interview subjects were cited as reasons for his exclusion. The editors felt that Peter Maiden was smart and enthusiastic, as well as a good employee but lacking journalistic experience. His failure to turn in professional caliber pieces worried the editors, but he was still noticed by Wenner, who considered giving him an additional internship. Krishtine was viewed arrogant in the beginning of the internship, but her knowledge of hip-hop was invaluable in the last four weeks. Tika Milan started very strong in the initial stages of the show, but it was perceived that she gave up towards the end, producing very little material and not aggressively pursuing stories. Later it was revealed that the winner of the year-long contributing editor position was Krishtine de Leon. It was speculated that her extensive understanding of hip-hop music and culture and her ability to turn in usable, relevant material was what catapulted her over the top. After I'm from Rolling Stone  Peter Maiden is now a video editor for Rolling Stone. He is also a bartender in New York. Tika Milan (Tiq Milan) became a freelance writer for a new magazine called Dapper, before coming out as a trans man. Russell Morse returned to San Francisco and his position at New American Media. He now works as an Outreach Coordinator at a Youth Development Organization called The Door in Manhattan. Krystal Ann Simpson currently splits her time between Los Angeles and New York designing, modeling, and writing for her social commentary blog WhatisRealityAnyway.com. Colin Stutz returned to Los Angeles to complete his junior year at USC and work as the editorial assistant at Filter Magazine.  Viewership  The show was plagued by low ratings, getting only 369,000 viewers for the premiere episode.WWD: ROLLING FLAT To further exacerbate the problem, the show's time slot was also pushed back to 11 PM.Idolator: I'm From Rolling Stone, Episode Guide, Part 6 The show was generally considered a flop due to very little promotion and its aim towards an older demographic, thus it was not renewed for a second season.

Farrell worked for The Times from 1995 to 2007, reporting from Kosovo, India, Afghanistan and the Middle East, including Iraq. In 2007, he joined The New York Times, and reported from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Libya, later moving to New York and London. Since January 2018, Farrell has been based in Jerusalem as the bureau chief of Reuters. Early career and The Times Farrell studied English Language and Literature at Edinburgh University in Scotland before becoming a journalist on a London local newspaper, a news agency and then the now-defunct Today newspaper, for which he reported from Britain, Northern Ireland and the Balkans. After Today ceased publication in 1995 he joined The Times, working as a news reporter on stories such as the Dunblane school massacre in Scotland, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris and the conflict in Kosovo. He became The Times‚Äôs South Asia correspondent in 2000, based in New Delhi and reporting from Afghanistan under Taliban rule, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. From 2001 to 2007 he was Middle East correspondent, covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. In April 2004, while on assignment for The Times, he was kidnapped by Sunni insurgents during the First Battle of Fallujah. He was freed unharmed after eight hours of captivity. The New York Times In July 2007, Farrell joined The New York Times, initially as a correspondent in Baghdad, and later as a foreign correspondent reporting in print and video across the Middle East, including Libya, the Tahrir Square protests in Cairo and Jordan. In 2007 he was part of the NYT's Baghdad bureau, which won the Overseas Press Club of America award for best web coverage of international affairs, for the multimedia feature \\"Assessing the Surge: A Survey of Baghdad Neighborhoods\\". The bureau's staff were finalists in the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. From 2008, Farrell wrote the Baghdad Bureau blog which was renamed as \\"At War\\" in 2009 and expanded, becoming \\"a reported blog from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other conflicts in the post-9/11 era\\". Farrell ran the At War blog from the field from 2009 until early 2012, when he handed over to editors based in New York. On 5 September 2009, while Farrell and his interpreter Sultan Munadi were in a village south of Kunduz, Afghanistan, investigating reports of civilian casualties in a NATO strike on two fuel tankers that had been hijacked by the Taliban they were kidnapped.Berlin to Pay Afghan Families for Fatal Attack The New York Times 2010-08-10 On 9 September, four days after the kidnap, a British Army raid rescued Farrell. Corporal John Harrison, a British soldier from the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, Special Forces Support Group and Farrell's interpreter, Sultan Munadi were killed. During his captivity, media organizations and Wikipedia imposed a news blackout on his kidnapping, similar to that which had taken place during the kidnapping of fellow New York Times journalist David Rohde a few months earlier, for fear that media attention would increase the risk to the captives. Prior to his kidnap Farrell had ignored repeated warnings that it was too dangerous to travel to the site and was later criticized for his actions which cost the life of one of the soldiers involved in his rescue. After the rescue The New York Times's public editor, Clark Hoyt, questioned Farrell and Times editors about the incident for a column headlined 'Calculations of War: Which Risk Is Reasonable?' Hoyt quoted Bill Keller, the then executive editor, saying \\"I have seen no evidence that his reporting mission was reckless or irresponsible.‚Äù Hoyt said Farrell denied assertions that he ignored repeated warnings, writing: \\"Farrell told me the only warning he got came from a policeman who said it would not be safe to go to the scene of the airstrike because darkness was approaching\\" and that he did not go there until the next morning. Hoyt concluded, \\"I cannot make the judgment ‚Äî as so many do without all the facts ‚Äî that Farrell acted recklessly.\\" He added: \\"independent reporting is often the only way to uncover truths that governments and militaries do not want the public to know, like the carnage from airstrikes.\\" Farrell was detained again in Libya in March 2011. The New York Times reported on 18 March 2011 that Libya had agreed to free him and three colleagues: Anthony Shadid, Lynsey Addario and Tyler Hicks. Farrell was released on 21 March 2011, along with all of his colleagues. Farrell was part of the NYT reporting and graphics team which won Society for News Design and Malofiej awards for 18 Days at the Center of Egypt's Revolution, a graphic map of the February 2011 Egyptian protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The map was updated throughout the demonstrations, which led to the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. Farrell joined the NYT in New York in October 2012. He was a member of the NYT video journalism unit which won an online 2013 National Edward R. Murrow Award for its breaking news coverage of the impact of Hurricane Sandy on New York. In 2016 he moved to the NYT's London bureau to work on the digital news desk, on the team developing a new design for the Times's website and mobile phone app. Reuters In December 2017 Farrell joined Reuters news agency as a writer and video journalist and moved to Jerusalem to become Bureau Chief for Israel and the Palestinian Territories, overseeing text, pictures and television.

She is active in Toronto's music and cultural scene. Career In the mid 2000s, Mecija contributed to turning her home on Bellwoods Avenue into a community hub for young artists and musicians. In part driven by a push back against an industry driven by capital and market trends, the space was focused on collaboration and collectivity. She hosted concerts in her basement, showcasing and supporting emerging artists, many of whom have become notable musicians. She co-founded the Friends in Bellwoods music project, which has raised thousands of dollars for the Daily Bread Food Bank of Toronto. Simultaneously, she was the lead vocalist and songwriter for Ohbijou, an orchestral-pop band which toured internationally and acquired large amounts of popularity. Ohbijou was born of the ethos of the home, foregrounding friendship with a desire to make art and music that inspired social change. In 2013, Ohbijou went on hiatus as they grappled with the reality of their own involvement in the industry they hoped to shirk. At that time, Mecija shifted focus towards producing scholarship about diaspora, queer theory, sound studies and aesthetics. Recent Work Mecija continues to make music under her own name, releasing her first solo album, Psychic Materials in early 2016. A return to the DIY aesthetic that inspired her initial pursuits, the album addresses ideas surrounding queerness, diaspora, history and love. She is also an award-winning filmmaker, her work being screened internationally and at the Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival where she was awarded the WIFT-T Award (Women in Film and Television), as well as at Inside Out Film and Video Festival.

His poetry showed the spirit of Taoism but also reflected Buddhism. He was a graduate of Seongkyungwan University (1955) and later a professor at the same school. Life  Kim Gu-yong was born Kim Yeongtak on February 5, 1922, in Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do. During Japanese colonial occupation, Kim resided at various Buddhist temples, including the Donghaksa Temple, studying Buddhist, Confucian, and Taoist classic texts. Following Liberation, Kim entered Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, and graduated with a degree in Korean Literature. Kim made his official literary debut in 1949 while still a student, with the publication of \\"Night in the Mountains\\" (Sanjungya) and \\"Ode to a White Pagoda‚Äù (Baegtapsong) in New World.\\"Kim Guyong\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Kim worked for the Hyundai Munhak Monthly and taught at Kyun Kwan University Work During the period marked by the devastating aftermath of the Korean War, Kim Gu-yong focused his poetic objective on the treatment of the postwar psychosocial and political upheaval, through the unique lens of the Buddhist religious tradition. In his poetry dating from the period, Kim utilized the form of the prose poem, which eschews the internal breaks and divisions created by the lines and stanza of traditional verses. To maintain a poetic element within his work, Kim employed a poetic language rich in semantic possibility. In fact, the absence of rigid versification in his works ultimately serves to heighten the tension in this poetic language. Kim's poetic career witnessed a transition from the prose poem of the post-Korean War period to longer poems such as \\"Song in Praise of the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy\\" (Gwaneumchan), \\"Ideals of the Dream\\" (Kkumui isang), and \\"Six Songs\\" (Yukgok). These longer poems evince the poet's desire to penetrate to the core of self-consciousness, though they also possess a philosophical profundity otherwise difficult to effectively convey in shorter poetry. Though grounded in Buddhist thought, Kim's poetry reveals the deep influence of Western surrealism in the development of the poet's aesthetic. His concurrent borrowing from the prose form, however, suggests foremost the poet's penchant for experimentation and desire to reinvent and reinvigorate traditional versification. Thus in both form and content, the poetry of Kim Guyong forged a new path in the development of modern Korean poetry.

Located about southeast of Burns, the lake is a marsh fed by the Donner und Blitzen River from the south and the Silvies River from the north. Malheur Lake periodically overflows into Mud Lake to the west and thence to Harney Lake, the sink of Harney Basin. The western area of Malheur Lake consists of ponds separated by small islands and peninsulas. The lake's central and eastern sections are more open. The generally shallow water is suitable habitat for migratory birds, waterfowl, and aquatic plants. As is typical of Great Basin lakes, Malheur Lake's surface area changes dramatically with the local weather, climate, and season because the lake is in a very flat basin. A large influence on the water volume is local snow melt, especially from Steens Mountain, south of the lake. For example, large snowpacks in the mid-1980s caused the lake to expand from approximately within three years, flooding usually dry areas and damaging a branch of the Oregon Eastern Railway. Soon afterward, drought in the early 1990s reduced the lake size to just , exposing large mudflats and dusty playas. Geology Malheur Lake is a remnant of a much larger Pleistocene lake that drained east to the Malheur River, a tributary of the Snake River. The size of this ancient lake, which existed during a wetter climate, has been estimated at , with a maximum depth of . Its outlet was originally a channel near New Princeton, but lava flows diverted the water to a gap near Crane. Much of the original lake bottom has since turned into desert or become meadows periodically watered by lake overflows. Mud Lake and Harney Lake are also remnants of the original pluvial lake. The lakes as well as nearby marshes and playas are part of Harney Basin. The basin, a closed depression, covers , which makes it larger than the state of Connecticut. Ecology Malheur Lake contains many aquatic plants and grasses and is an important nesting and feeding area for waterfowl, migratory birds, and many other bird species. Wildlife includes ducks, geese, swans, herons, egrets, gulls, terns, and grebes. =Malheur Lake Basin redband trout= The Great Basin redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss newberri) has reduced access to Malheur and Harney lakes due to irrigation diversions, channelization, draining of marshlands, and high alkalinities. An exotic carp population is present in Malheur Lake and has caused extreme habitat damage. Harney Lake has been inhospitable to redband trout for many years due to high alkalinities. Today, redband trout in the Malheur Lake basin are widely distributed in small- and medium-size streams. The redband trout is a unique subspecies adapted to the Malheur Lake basin ecosystem. In these closed, high-desert basins, redband trout have evolved to survive in environments with vast extremes of both water flow and temperature. They are one of only eight desert-basin populations of interior native redband trout. The Malheur Lake redband comprises 10 population groups in the closed interior basin of Harney and Malheur lakes. Historically, all streams were interconnected, and these fish moved through all the lakes and streams.Behnke, R.J. 1992. Native Trout of Western North America. American Fisheries Society Monograph 6. Bethesda, MD. While not an officially designated threatened or endangered species, the redband trout is recognized as important resource, and the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-399) sets aside land in Oregon for protection and research of redband trout.Malheur Lake Basin Redband - The Ecological Angler See also * List of lakes in Oregon References External links *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Malheur National Wildlife Refuge *Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan *Getting, A.C.

Guerber, was an American author of many books, most of which were lively retellings of myths, legends, folklore, plays, epic poetry, operas and history. She was also a teacher. Although several books by Guerber are still in print, details about her life are scant. There are entries for her in three or four biographical sources from the early 1900s, but apart from listing the books she wrote, these sources provide almost no facts about her life. These book sources are supplemented by two short death notices, six Census records (five federal and the 1892 New York state), and her memorial on findagrave.com. Even the scant information is sometimes conflicting. Although H√©l√®ne Guerber published over two dozen books in her lifetime, as a person she is almost forgotten.  Biography  = Family = According to her death announcement which appeared in the Publisher's Weekly in 1929, Guerber was born in Mt. Clemens, Michigan in 1859 (on March 9). Census records list her father as Arnold S. Guerber, born in 1830 in Italy to Swiss parents, and her mother as Emma Guerber, also born in 1830 and of Swiss nationality. Arnold arrived in America in 1845, and Emma in 1853. In 1900 they had been married for 47 years, so they must have gotten married the year Emma arrived in America - 1853. Arnold Guerber held various jobs -- In 1870, he was an Importer of straw goods; in 1880 he was a farmer; and in 1892 and in 1900 (when he was 70), he was a real estate broker. The Guerber family appeared well-off. In 1870, when Arnold was 40, he owned real estate valued at $14,000 and personal property valued at $3,000. According to the Censuses of 1870, 1900 and 1910, the family also kept a domestic servant. The 1900 Census states that the Guerbers had five children - three sons and two daughters - H√©l√®ne was the third child in the family. The other children were: Frederick (1854), Louis (1857), Paul (1861) and Adele (1866). H√©l√®ne was the only one born in Michigan - the other children were all born in New York, and except for H√©l√®ne's birth in the Midwest, all records show the family residing on the East Coast. From 1870 to 1910, the family lived in Rockland County, New York -- In 1870, in the town of Ramapo, NY; in 1880, when Arnold was working as a farmer, in the unincorporated village of Monsey, NY; and in 1892, 1900 and 1910 in Orangetown, NY -- Some sources during this time list Guerber as living in Nyack, NY, but Nyack is actually a village within Orangetown. H√©l√®ne Guerber never married. She kept her maiden name all of her life and lived with her parents and siblings. By the 1920 Census, after her parents had passed away, H√©l√®ne moved to Montclair, New Jersey with her sister Adele and her niece Louise. The Publisher's Weekly notice says that at the time of her death in 1929, she had been living in Montclair for sixteen years, so she must have moved there around 1913-14. = Education = As for H√©l√®ne's education, the Publisher's Weekly death notice also says that, \\"While Miss Guerber had very little early education, her interests led her to deal with academic classics.\\" However, the 1914-15 Woman's Who's Who of America states that she was educated in Paris, France. It also lists her religion as Episcopalian. A Paris education seems plausible. She must have spent a good deal of time in Europe, enough to research a detailed guidebook, How to Prepare for Europe: A Handbook of Historical, Literary and Artistic Data with Full Directions for Preliminary Studies and Travel Arrangements (Dodd Mead, 1906). This book exhibits a wide knowledge of European culture and travel. She obviously also felt comfortable with the French and German languages, because she wrote student readers in these languages. = Teaching Experience = Guerber's teaching experience was probably at the pre-high school level, because she wrote educational books aimed at that level. She wrote eight books in the Eclectic School Readings Series published by the American Book Company, and they were referred to as Guerber's Historical Readers. One advertisement for these books says they were aimed at students 12-14 years old. In her Preface to The Story of the Greeks, she speaks from her experience as a teacher when she says, \\"I have found historical anecdotes an excellent aid in teaching English. Pupils find it far from irksome to relate the stories in their own words, and to reproduce them in compositions. Secondly, whenever a city or country is mentioned, every pupil should point out its location on the map. By such means only can any one properly understand an historical narrative; and in the present case there is the added reason that the practice will go far towards increasing the child's interest in geography.\\" Other books in this series include histories on the Romans, the Chosen People, England, France and the Thirteen Colonies. = Retellings of Myths & Legends = However, Guerber's most enduring works are the ones dealing with myth and legend and written for adult audiences. WorldCat says that 104 editions of The Myths of Greece and Rome were published between 1893 and 2017 in English and French and held by 1,194 libraries worldwide. Dover Publications says of their version that \\"This generously illustrated book of classical myths has become a classic itself, long prized for its simple, graphic, accurate retelling of the principal myths of Greece and Rome, and for its commentary on their origins and significance.\\" Guerber's Myths of the Norsemen from the Eddas and Sagas, Legends of the Rhine, and Myths and Legends of the Middle Ages are also enduring classics. Less well-known, but just as interesting, are her retellings of Shakespeare's plays, Wagner's and other popular operas, and the great epic poems. = Death = H√©l√®ne Guerber died on May 26, 1929. Her simple death notice, published in the Montclair, New Jersey Times, read as follows -- DIED GUERBER, HELENE A. At her residence, 31 Oakwood Ave., Upper Montclair, N.J., on Sunday, May 26, 1929. Funeral services at St. James' Church, corner of Dellevue Ave. and Valley Rd., Upper Montclair, yesterday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. Interment at Greenwood Cemetery. Her parents Arnold and Emma and her brother Louis are also buried in Greenwood Cemetery, NY.  Works  Other histories by Guerber include The Myths of Greece & Rome (London, George G Harrap & Co, 1908), Legends of the Rhine (A.S.

The title of the album was inspired by Carl Jung's concept of anima and animus (\\"the woman inside the man, the man inside the woman\\"). Recorded in France and England, the album was a departure from previous Creatures works. While still retaining a percussive element, the music had a more urban sound. Upon its release, the record was well received by critics. Anima Animus was later hailed by peer PJ Harvey, who selected it in her Top 10 Albums of 1999.\\"7th January 2000 - PJ selects her Top 10 Albums of 1999\\". Pjharvey.net. 7 January 2000. Retrieved 15 December 2009. Featuring The Creatures (a.k.a. Siouxsie and Budgie) for the album Anima Animus. History and music The pair began developing ideas for the songs in 1995. \\"Exterminating Angel\\" was composed that autumn in France. Siouxsie and Budgie had purchased a lot of equipment and decided to work at their house near Toulouse. The original title of the album was Gifthorse, then Mount Venus, before the duo changed their minds to finally opt for Anima Animus, which was a reference to Jung's theory of \\"The Man Inside The Woman and The Woman Inside The Man\\". In 1996, no major label was interested in the demos, as they were judged as too avant-garde and not commercial enough. Siouxsie and Budgie then decided to finance the project themselves, and began recording on their own. They produced the album with the assistance of Steve Lyon, Steve Levine and Warne Livesey. Four songs (\\"2nd Floor\\", \\"Another Planet\\", \\"Say\\" and \\"I Was Me\\") were recorded in England. While staying in London, they met Doug Hart, who owned an independent label, Hydrogen Records. With his help, the Creatures set up their own label called Sioux Records, and became an independent act. The album was finally mixed in New York. The portraits of Siouxsie and Budgie for the sleeves were designed and conceived by French artists Pierre et Gilles in Paris in 1997. Lucy O'Brien described \\"2nd Floor\\" as \\"a driving, thumping dancefloor thing that exudes a brooding glamour\\". Siouxsie said that the song was about the state a person was after having too many Vodka Gimlets. \\"it's when you still want more, when you want the party to continue and it's beyond being sensible. I remember times when I was the one person left in a place, and the euphoria that goes along with it. 2nd Floor was my idea of what a private drinking bar would be, that was open all the time.\\" She also stated that \\"There's something very religious about bars. They're like altars. The lighting. The colour of the bottles. Having a drink. It's like Santa's Grotto time.\\" \\"Don't Go to Sleep Without Me\\" is a \\"ghostly lullaby\\". Release The first single, \\"2nd Floor\\", was issued in late 1998, shortly after the four-track EP Eraser Cut. The second single, \\"Say\\", featured two unreleased B-sides: the acoustic \\"Broken\\" and the atmospheric \\"All She Could Ask For\\". The latter song opened their 1999 concerts. All of this extra material was later included on the U.S. Retrace compilation. Anima Animus was released on both CD and double 10-inch vinyl record. Critical reception The album was well received by critics. The Times gave it 8 out of 10 and wrote: \\"Siouxsie, has rarely been in better voice. The opening track, \\"2nd Floor\\" is a fantastically knowing melodrama, riding a techno pulse, while the ominous, epic \\"Exterminating Angel\\" pursues its prey in lamplit streets. It's entrancing, hypnotic and inventive\\".\\"Anima Animus\\" review. The Times. 2 February 1999. The Sunday Times also praised it in these glowing terms: \\"Siouxsie's voice has lost none of its ability to seduce and unsettle. The sound is percussive, defined by Budgie's supple rhythm work. \\"Exterminating Angel\\" is exquisitely menacing, while the sinuous \\"Another Planet\\" grows to a shuddering climax.\\"\\"Anima Animus\\" review. Sunday Times. 14 February 1999. Uncut reviewer Chris Roberts gave the album 4 out of 5, saying: \\"Sioux's always been at her best as a harsh declaimer [...] but there are phases where she whispers, breathes, reaches for vulnerability\\", before concluding \\"The Creatures have jettisoned comfort and are phoning home from a new end zone.

It is part of the M√ºller UK & Ireland Group, that is owned by the German M√ºller family. It has eleven major dairies (in Aberdeen, East Kilbride, Glasgow, Manchester, Droitwich Spa, Bridgwater, Severnside, Foston, Market Drayton and Hanworth). The company also produces Frijj milkshake, cream, and more recently, spreadable butter. The milk business of Dairy Crest was merged into the company in December 2015, following the purchase of the business by its parent. The company now delivers milk to around 715,000 households via their Milk & More doorstep delivery business. Following completion of the sale, the company was renamed. It supplies around 30% of Britain's fresh milk, and has Britain's biggest fresh milk distribution network. M√ºller Milk & Ingredients also supply several large grocery retailers. History Robert Wiseman Dairies was founded in 1947 by Robert Wiseman Senior. It started off as a small family farm in East Kilbride that carried out doorstep deliveries using a horse and cart. Alan Wiseman joined the business straight from school in 1967, and worked his way up to become chairman. Eight years later, Robert Wiseman Jnr became managing director. In 1988 the company built a bespoke dairy in Bellshill, Lanarkshire. This dairy was designed for supermarket supplies and quickly gained contracts from some of the larger retailers. Having achieved success within Scotland, the directors were determined to continue expanding the business and saw an opportunity to repeat what had been achieved in Scotland, by establishing a production base in the North of England. Robert Wiseman Dairies was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In the same year, the government abolished the Milk Marketing Board, allowing dairy farmers to sell their milk to whoever they chose. At this time, Wiseman created the Wiseman Milk Partnership, a group of farmers contracted to supply their milk direct to Robert Wiseman Dairies. The company opened a dairy in Droitwich Spa in May 2001, which at the time was the biggest in Europe, and has a maximum capacity to process 650 million litres per year. 2006 saw the acquisition of the Milk Link liquid milk business, which meant the company stretched from Keith in the North of Scotland to Cornwall in the South of England. Robert Wiseman Dairies opened a dairy in Bridgwater in September 2008, which is considered to be Britain‚Äôs most efficient and environmentally advanced fresh milk dairy. In January 2012, the company agreed to a takeover by the family run, German dairy company, M√ºller, and was returned to private ownership. The business then became known as M√ºller Wiseman Dairies, and is part of the M√ºller UK & Ireland Group. Carl Ravenhall was appointed managing director of M√ºller Wiseman Dairies in March 2013. In November 2014, Dairy Crest announced the sale of its milk processing and distribution business to M√ºller for ¬£80 million, to be combined with M√ºller Wiseman Dairies. The sale was approved by the Competition and Markets Authority on 19 October 2015, and was completed on 26 December 2015. Products M√ºller produces some the United Kingdom‚Äôs fresh milk brands including the country‚Äôs first semi skimmed milk, Fresh‚Äôn‚ÄôLo, Puriti (with its extended shelf life) and The One (a 1% fat milk). The most recognised brand is the Black and White brand milk and there are six regional labels currently in the portfolio: Grampian, Milk from Scotland, West Country, Cornish, Milk from Wales and more recently milk from the Northern Dairy. Milk is not the only product in their portfolio; they process and distribute double, whipping, single and clotted cream along with spreadable butter. Since December 2015, M√ºller now produce Frijj Milkshakes. M√ºller also owns the United Kingdom‚Äôs largest butter plant, in Market Drayton. The ¬£17 million plant was officially opened on 6 December 2013, by Theo M√ºller Senior and Owen Paterson, MP for North Shropshire and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The plant is capable of producing 45,000 tonnes of salted, unsalted and lactic butter made with cream from British dairy farms. Operations Muller's Chadwell Heath milk production site (formerly Dairy Crest) In July 2013, the company announced the closure of its depots in Keith and Whitburn, because of a significant reduction in the number of delivery runs from each site. In October 2013, M√ºller Dairies‚Äô Droitwich dairy, one of the biggest in their portfolio, was damaged by a fire. Despite immediate shut down of operations at the business‚Äô largest fresh milk dairy, the company maintained supplies of fresh milk to its customers by increasing production at other sites and the co-operation with other dairy suppliers. In December 2015, the company took on the online ordering service for its doorstep customers known as Milk & More, formerly operated by Dairy Crest.

It neighbors Budaiya highway and the village of Duraz to the north, Saar and Magaba highway to the east, the villages of Bani Jamra and Al Garya to the west, and the village of Saar to the south. Etymology Some historians say the village was named after a Bedouin called Al Markh who settled in the village with his family due to it being uninhabited and suitable for farming, while others say that it is the name of a tree that was burned to warm up people thousands of years ago. History Al Markh is the site of the Dilmun era \\"Abu Alyawa\\" spring. Al Markh, along with neighbouring villages Bani Jamra and Duraz, was a traditional centre for canvas-making and sail making. Sister site Al Markh is also the name of a low sand-covered mound located in the south-west of Bahrain, 6 km south of the village of Zallaq and 1,200 m from the sea. In 1975, a British archaeology team led by Michael Roaf excavated the Al Markh mound, after sherds belonging to the Ubaid era were found in 1971. The expedition resulted in the discovery of 6,896 pieces of flint, mainly in the form of scrapers. Evidence was also obtained from the site that showed that the sea level of Bahrain during the late Neolithic era was much higher than present-day levels by as much as 4 m with some speculating that Al Markh was itself an islet. Potteries found on the site were dated to 3,800 BC. It is assumed by archaeologists that the site did not host permanent settlements but rather, it was occupied seasonally by fishermen and hunters. The site showed two phases of occupation: * The earlier phase included flint chips and a number of painted potsherds that were dated to be from the late Ubaid or post-Ubaid era. The potteries were used, mended and then reused by inhabitants. Numerous fish bones belonging to the Sparid family were also found, mammal bones were rare onsite. Shellfish, including pearl oysters, were found as well as numerous shallow fire pits that had fish bones in them. *The later phase had little pottery but much more flint than the previous phase. Seafood was still common although a larger fish bones were found. In contrast with the earlier phase, mammal bones belonging to goats, dugongs and hare were found.

ChIP-on-chip (also known as ChIP-chip) is a technology that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation ('ChIP') with DNA microarray (\\"chip\\"). Like regular ChIP, ChIP-on-chip is used to investigate interactions between proteins and DNA in vivo. Specifically, it allows the identification of the cistrome, the sum of binding sites, for DNA- binding proteins on a genome-wide basis. Whole-genome analysis can be performed to determine the locations of binding sites for almost any protein of interest. As the name of the technique suggests, such proteins are generally those operating in the context of chromatin. The most prominent representatives of this class are transcription factors, replication-related proteins, like origin recognition complex protein (ORC), histones, their variants, and histone modifications. The goal of ChIP-on-chip is to locate protein binding sites that may help identify functional elements in the genome. For example, in the case of a transcription factor as a protein of interest, one can determine its transcription factor binding sites throughout the genome. Other proteins allow the identification of promoter regions, enhancers, repressors and silencing elements, insulators, boundary elements, and sequences that control DNA replication.M.J. Buck, J.D. Lieb, ChIP-chip: considerations for the design, analysis, and application of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, Genomics 83 (2004) 349-360. If histones are subject of interest, it is believed that the distribution of modifications and their localizations may offer new insights into the mechanisms of regulation. One of the long-term goals ChIP-on-chip was designed for is to establish a catalogue of (selected) organisms that lists all protein-DNA interactions under various physiological conditions. This knowledge would ultimately help in the understanding of the machinery behind gene regulation, cell proliferation, and disease progression. Hence, ChIP-on- chip offers both potential to complement our knowledge about the orchestration of the genome on the nucleotide level and information on higher levels of information and regulation as it is propagated by research on epigenetics. TOC  Technological platforms  The technical platforms to conduct ChIP-on-chip experiments are DNA microarrays, or \\"chips\\". They can be classified and distinguished according to various characteristics: Probe type: DNA arrays can comprise either mechanically spotted cDNAs or PCR-products, mechanically spotted oligonucleotides, or oligonucleotides that are synthesized in situ. The early versions of microarrays were designed to detect RNAs from expressed genomic regions (open reading frames aka ORFs). Although such arrays are perfectly suited to study gene expression profiles, they have limited importance in ChIP experiments since most \\"interesting\\" proteins with respect to this technique bind in intergenic regions. Nowadays, even custom- made arrays can be designed and fine-tuned to match the requirements of an experiment. Also, any sequence of nucleotides can be synthesized to cover genic as well as intergenic regions. Probe size: Early version of cDNA arrays had a probe length of about 200bp. Latest array versions use oligos as short as 70- (Microarrays, Inc.) to 25-mers (Affymetrix). (Feb 2007) Probe composition: There are tiled and non-tiled DNA arrays. Non-tiled arrays use probes selected according to non-spatial criteria, i.e., the DNA sequences used as probes have no fixed distances in the genome. Tiled arrays, however, select a genomic region (or even a whole genome) and divide it into equal chunks. Such a region is called tiled path. The average distance between each pair of neighboring chunks (measured from the center of each chunk) gives the resolution of the tiled path. A path can be overlapping, end-to-end or spaced.Royce TE, Rozowsky JS, Bertone P, Samanta M, Stolc V, Weissman S, Snyder M, Gerstein M. Related Articles. Issues in the analysis of oligonucleotide tiling microarrays for transcript mapping. Trends Genet. 2005 Aug;21(8):466-75. Review. Array size: The first microarrays used for ChIP-on- Chip contained about 13,000 spotted DNA segments representing all ORFs and intergenic regions from the yeast genome. Nowadays, Affymetrix offers whole- genome tiled yeast arrays with a resolution of 5bp (all in all 3.2 million probes). Tiled arrays for the human genome become more and more powerful, too. Just to name one example, Affymetrix offers a set of seven arrays with about 90 million probes, spanning the complete non-repetitive part of the human genome with about 35bp spacing. (Feb 2007) Besides the actual microarray, other hard- and software equipment is necessary to run ChIP-on-chip experiments. It is generally the case that one company‚Äôs microarrays can not be analyzed by another company‚Äôs processing hardware. Hence, buying an array requires also buying the associated workflow equipment. The most important elements are, among others, hybridization ovens, chip scanners, and software packages for subsequent numerical analysis of the raw data.  Workflow of a ChIP-on-chip experiment  Starting with a biological question, a ChIP-on-chip experiment can be divided into three major steps: The first is to set up and design the experiment by selecting the appropriate array and probe type. Second, the actual experiment is performed in the wet-lab. Last, during the dry-lab portion of the cycle, gathered data are analyzed to either answer the initial question or lead to new questions so that the cycle can start again. = Wet-lab portion of the workflow = Workflow overview of the wet-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment. In the first step, the protein of interest (POI) is cross-linked with the DNA site it binds to in an in vitro environment. Usually this is done by a gentle formaldehyde fixation that is reversible with heat. Then, the cells are lysed and the DNA is sheared by sonication or using micrococcal nuclease. This results in double-stranded chunks of DNA fragments, normally 1 kb or less in length. Those that were cross-linked to the POI form a POI-DNA complex. In the next step, only these complexes are filtered out of the set of DNA fragments, using an antibody specific to the POI. The antibodies may be attached to a solid surface, may have a magnetic bead, or some other physical property that allows separation of cross-linked complexes and unbound fragments. This procedure is essentially an immunoprecipitation (IP) of the protein. This can be done either by using a tagged protein with an antibody against the tag (ex. FLAG, HA, c-myc) or with an antibody to the native protein. The cross-linking of POI-DNA complexes is reversed (usually by heating) and the DNA strands are purified. For the rest of the workflow, the POI is no longer necessary. After an amplification and denaturation step, the single-stranded DNA fragments are labeled with a fluorescent tag such as Cy5 or Alexa 647. Finally, the fragments are poured over the surface of the DNA microarray, which is spotted with short, single- stranded sequences that cover the genomic portion of interest. Whenever a labeled fragment \\"finds\\" a complementary fragment on the array, they will hybridize and form again a double-stranded DNA fragment. = Dry-lab portion of the workflow = Workflow overview of the dry-lab portion of a ChIP-on-chip experiment. After a sufficiently large time frame to allow hybridization, the array is illuminated with fluorescent light. Those probes on the array that are hybridized to one of the labeled fragments emit a light signal that is captured by a camera. This image contains all raw data for the remaining part of the workflow. This raw data, encoded as false-color image, needs to be converted to numerical values before the actual analysis can be done. The analysis and information extraction of the raw data often remains the most challenging part for ChIP-on-chip experiments. Problems arise throughout this portion of the workflow, ranging from the initial chip read-out, to suitable methods to subtract background noise, and finally to appropriate algorithms that normalize the data and make it available for subsequent statistical analysis, which then hopefully lead to a better understanding of the biological question that the experiment seeks to address. Furthermore, due to the different array platforms and lack of standardization between them, data storage and exchange is a huge problem. Generally speaking, the data analysis can be divided into three major steps: During the first step, the captured fluorescence signals from the array are normalized, using control signals derived from the same or a second chip. Such control signals tell which probes on the array were hybridized correctly and which bound nonspecifically. In the second step, numerical and statistical tests are applied to control data and IP fraction data to identify POI-enriched regions along the genome. The following three methods are used widely: median percentile rank, single-array error, and sliding-window. These methods generally differ in how low-intensity signals are handled, how much background noise is accepted, and which trait for the data is emphasized during the computation. In the recent past, the sliding-window approach seems to be favored and is often described as most powerful. In the third step, these regions are analyzed further. If, for example, the POI was a transcription factor, such regions would represent its binding sites. Subsequent analysis then may want to infer nucleotide motifs and other patterns to allow functional annotation of the genome.  Strengths and weaknesses  Using tiled arrays, ChIP-on-chip allows for high resolution of genome-wide maps. These maps can determine the binding sites of many DNA- binding proteins like transcription factors and also chromatin modifications. Although ChIP-on-chip can be a powerful technique in the area of genomics, it is very expensive. Most published studies using ChIP-on-chip repeat their experiments at least three times to ensure biologically meaningful maps. The cost of the DNA microarrays is often a limiting factor to whether a laboratory should proceed with a ChIP-on-chip experiment. Another limitation is the size of DNA fragments that can be achieved. Most ChIP-on-chip protocols utilize sonication as a method of breaking up DNA into small pieces. However, sonication is limited to a minimal fragment size of 200 bp. For higher resolution maps, this limitation should be overcome to achieve smaller fragments, preferably to single nucleosome resolution. As mentioned previously, the statistical analysis of the huge amount of data generated from arrays is a challenge and normalization procedures should aim to minimize artifacts and determine what is really biologically significant. So far, application to mammalian genomes has been a major limitation, for example, due to the significant percentage of the genome that is occupied by repeats. However, as ChIP-on-chip technology advances, high resolution whole mammalian genome maps should become achievable. Antibodies used for ChIP-on-chip can be an important limiting factor. ChIP-on-chip requires highly specific antibodies that must recognize its epitope in free solution and also under fixed conditions. If it is demonstrated to successfully immunoprecipitate cross- linked chromatin, it is termed \\"ChIP-grade\\". Companies that provide ChIP-grade antibodies include Abcam, Cell Signaling Technology, Santa Cruz, and Upstate. To overcome the problem of specificity, the protein of interest can be fused to a tag like FLAG or HA that are recognized by antibodies. An alternative to ChIP-on-chip that does not require antibodies is DamID. Also available are antibodies against a specific histone modification like H3 tri methyl K4. As mentioned before, the combination of these antibodies and ChIP-on-chip has become extremely powerful in determining whole genome analysis of histone modification patterns and will contribute tremendously to our understanding of the histone code and epigenetics. A study demonstrating the non-specific nature of DNA binding proteins has been published in PLoS Biology. This indicates that alternate confirmation of functional relevancy is a necessary step in any ChIP-chip experiment.  History  A first ChIP-on-chip experiment was performed in 1999 to analyze the distribution of cohesin along budding yeast chromosome III.Blat Y, Kleckner N., Cohesins bind to preferential sites along yeast chromosome III, with differential regulation along arms versus the centric region, Cell (1999) Jul 23;98(2):249-59. Although the genome was not completely represented, the protocol in this study remains equivalent as those used in later studies. The ChIP-on-chip technique using all of the ORFs of the genome (that nevertheless remains incomplete, missing intergenic regions) was then applied successfully in three papers published in 2000 and 2001.J.D.

The authors identified binding sites for individual transcription factors in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In 2002, Richard Young‚Äôs groupT.I. Lee, N.J. Rinaldi, F. Robert, D.T.

Gifford, R.A Young, Transcriptional regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Science 298 (2002) 799-804. determined the genome-wide positions of 106 transcription factors using a c-Myc tagging system in yeast. The first demonstration of the mammalian ChIp- on-chip technique reported the isolation of nine chromatin fragments containing weak and strong E2F binding site was done by Peggy Farnham's lab in collaboration with Michael Zhang's lab and published in 2001.Weinmann AS, Bartley SM, Zhang T, Zhang MQ, Farnham PJ. Use of chromatin immunoprecipation to clone novel E2F target promoters., Molecular and Cell Biology 20 (2001)6820-32. This study was followed several months later in a collaboration between the Young lab with the laboratory of Brian Dynlacht which used the ChIP-on-chip technique to show for the first time that E2F targets encode components of the DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways, as well as factors involved in chromatin assembly/condensation, chromosome segregation, and the mitotic spindle checkpointRen B, Cam H, Takahashi Y, Volkert T, Terragni J, Young RA, Dynlacht BD. E2F integrates cell cycle progression with DNA repair, and G2(M) checkpoints., Genes and Development 16 (2002) 245-56. Other applications for ChIP-on-chip include DNA replication, recombination, and chromatin structure. Since then, ChIP-on-chip has become a powerful tool in determining genome-wide maps of histone modifications and many more transcription factors. ChIP-on-chip in mammalian systems has been difficult due to the large and repetitive genomes. Thus, many studies in mammalian cells have focused on select promoter regions that are predicted to bind transcription factors and have not analyzed the entire genome. However, whole mammalian genome arrays have recently become commercially available from companies like Nimblegen. In the future, as ChIP-on-chip arrays become more and more advanced, high resolution whole genome maps of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin components for mammals will be analyzed in more detail. Alternatives Chip-Sequencing is a recently developed technology that still uses chromatin immunoprecipitation to crosslink the proteins of interest to the DNA but then instead of using a micro-array, it uses the more accurate, higher throughput method of sequencing to localize interaction points. DamID is an alternative method that does not require antibodies. ChIP-exo uses exonuclease treatment to achieve up to single base pair resolution. CUT&RUN; sequencing uses antibody recognition with targeted enzymatic cleavage to address some technical limitations of ChIP  References  Further reading  External links  * http://www.genome.gov/10005107 ENCODE project * Chip-on-Chip (CoC) Package Information from Amkor Technology =Analysis and software= * CoCAS: a free Analysis software for Agilent ChIP-on-Chip experiments * rMAT: R implementation from MAT program to normalize and analyze tiling arrays and ChIP-chip data.

I-35 provides four exits to Ardmore. After leaving Ardmore, it has a brief concurrency with State Highway 53 and enters Murray County and the Arbuckle Mountains. I-35 then passes through Garvin County and the county seat of Pauls Valley. North of exit 79, I-35 enters McClain County. There, it passes through Purcell and Goldsby. State Highway 9 joins the interstate crossing over the South Canadian River into Cleveland County, after which it splits off again. It then serves as a major urban interstate in Norman and Moore. Between Norman and Moore, US-77 joins the interstate again. It then enters Oklahoma City and Oklahoma County near milepost 120. Near downtown, I-35 splits off the mainline (which becomes Interstate 235/US-77) and runs concurrent with Interstate 40 for a mile before splitting off to the north again. Interstate 44 then joins I-35 between mileposts 133 and 137. In Edmond US-77 joins the interstate yet again. Interstate 35 in Goldsby, Oklahoma at milemarker 102. At milepost 146, I-35 enters Logan County. It serves Guthrie at Exit 153, where US-77 splits off, and at Exit 157. The interstate then crosses the Cimarron River into Payne County and enters Noble County shortly thereafter. It provides two exits to Perry and serves as the western terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike. After providing access to Tonkawa and Blackwell in Kay County, it crosses into Kansas, becoming the Kansas Turnpike. History Some sections of I-35 in Oklahoma City were already built in 1953, before the Interstate system was created. Following the passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1956 that created the Interstate Highway System, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation approved the location of the future interstate north of Oklahoma City to the Kansas state line on a route previously surveyed by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority for a proposed toll road. As a free road, the first five miles (8 km) of that section of I-35 were opened to traffic in 1958 from US-177 near Braman north to the Kansas border where it continued as the Kansas Turnpike. This was followed by completion of the entire route from Oklahoma City northward to Braman by 1963 in several phases including Edmond to Guthrie in 1960, Guthrie to Perry in 1961, Perry to Blackwell in 1962 and Blackwell to Braman in early 1963. To the south of Oklahoma City, I-35 was completed through Norman south to Purcell in June 1959. In Moore, it opened in two parts: the northern half, connecting Moore to Oklahoma City, opened in January 1960. The southern half, linking it to Norman, was opened to traffic in June 1967.Medley, Robert. \\"Higways[sic] continue to drive economy.\\" The Daily Oklahoman 29 June 2006: 1D. The Moore‚ÄìNorman segment was originally a four- lane section of US-77 built in 1951 that did not meet full Interstate Highway standards and included several at-grade intersections within the City of Moore including some with traffic signals and upgraded accordingly to include grade separations to bring up to full Interstate Highway standards and frontage roads to serve local traffic needs. Also not up to full Interstate Highway standards prior to 1967 was a section in the vicinity of Lindsey Street in the southern portion of Norman where another at-grade intersection still existed which dated back to the original highway's construction in the early 1950s‚Äîthis was also brought up to full Interstate Highway standards in 1967 with the construction of interchanges on I-35 at Lindsey and a short distance to the south for the future SH-9 bypass that would be built around the south side of Norman in the early 1970s. Further south, I-35 was completed from Marietta south to the Red River bridge in 1963, at which point a nearly gap of uncompleted interstate would exist between Purcell and Marietta until the late 1960s with traffic continuing to be routed over paralleling US-77. This was in large part due to efforts of the towns of Wynnewood, Paoli, and Wayne, fighting to keep I-35 as close as possible to US-77. This was successful due to a threat from Governor Henry Bellmon to build a toll road rather than I-35, and legislation preventing state funds for the interstate from being spent if it were more than from the U.S. route.McNichol, Dan. The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the U.S. Interstate System. New York: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2006. The uncompleted gap of I-35 in Southern Oklahoma was narrowed in 1967 and 1968 when two sections were completed from US-70/SH-199 in Ardmore south to SH-32 in Marietta. In 1969, the section of interstate bypassing Ardmore was completed north from US-70 two miles (3 km) to SH-142 and the following year, 1970, brought the completion of I-35 from SH-7 near Davis south to Ardmore, at long last bypassing the winding section of US-77 through the Arbuckle Mountains. This stretch through the Arbuckles was particularly expensive and difficult to construct, taking almost two years and requiring the blasting and removal of 4 million cubic yards of rock.Farmer, Ann. \\"Old Mountain Area Becomes A New Discovery\\" The Nevada (Mo.) Sunday Herald (republished for the AP by The Greenville (Tex.) Herald Banner) 9 June 1972: 12. A few months later in January, 1971, I-35 was finally completed across the state of Oklahoma, when the remaining portions of the interstate from Purcell to SH-7 near Davis were opened to traffic.Cockerell, Penny. \\"50 Years: As the intersection of Interstates 35, 40, and 44, Oklahoma is at America's crossroads.\\" The Daily Oklahoman 29 June 2006: 2A. Future In 2008, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation announced plans to widen of Interstate 35 through Norman, from the Main Street interchange to the McCall Bridge over the South Canadian River (Exit 109). Controversy surrounding the project arose when early drafts eliminated the SH-74A/Lindsey Street interchange (Exit 108B), due to its proximity to the State Highway 9 interchange (Exit 108A). A public meeting held in Norman attracted 300 attendees, many bearing \\"Don't Close Lindsey\\" signs. Attendees cited the impact on local businesses and those attending University of Oklahoma football games as grounds for opposing the closure of the interchange. A former OU economics professor estimated the interchange's closure would cost Norman $100 million over the course of fifteen years.Cole-Frowe, Carol. \\"Fired up: Residents fight for Lindsey Street interchange.\\" The Norman Transcript 19 September 2008: A1. At the meeting, four proposals were displayed, only one of which displayed no access from Lindsey Street. A second proposal would preserve access to Lindsey Street but require the seizure of a newly built Chevrolet dealership near the interchange. The third proposal would instead send the ramps around the dealership, and the fourth, the highest-cost alternate, would use bridges to prevent Lindsey Street and SH-9 traffic from conflicting. ODOT said their design standards did not require consideration of OU football traffic, because they only considered the 30th highest traffic percentile. One ODOT engineer was quoted as saying, \\"Otherwise, we'd have to 10-lane everything in Norman.\\" In early 2011, a solution was unveiled that would retain access to Lindsey St. and reconstruct the interchange without displacing the dealership. In 2014, ODOT completed reconstruction of the Main St. interchange as a Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) and widening of I-35 to just south of Main St. In early 2015, ODOT began a two-year, $71 million project to reconstruct the Lindsey St. interchange as a SPUI, reconstruct the SH-9 interchange and complete widening of I-35 to six lanes to the South Canadian River. ODOT plans to reconstruct I-35/I-240 interchange in southeast Oklahoma City in several phases, the first beginning in 2016.

His original name was Antonio Tatoti, but when he moved to Rome (c. 1656) from Rieti, he changed his surname. His father died when he was only eight years old, and in 1656, Monsignor Bulgarino Bulgarini, Governor of Rieti, became his patron. Two years later Bulgarini sponsored his travel to Rome, and introduced him to his future mentors, Pier Francesco Mola and Pietro da Cortona. In the large workshops organized by the latter, he developed skills in both painting and stucco decoration. In 1674, he joined the Accademia di San Luca. Although he did not build much, Gherardi's mature architecture is extraordinarily inventive. Designed in a late Baroque manner, he drew freely on forms and ideas of Bernini, Borromini and Cortona to make his inventions. The best examples of his work can be seen in the Santa Cecilia Chapel, San Carlo ai Catinari and the Avila Chapel, Santa Maria in Trastevere, both in Rome. In 1698 he was appointed architect and painter of the chapel of Santa Teresa in Santa Maria in Traspontina, which still preserves a painting of the Ecstasy of Santa Teresa.

Johnson appears seated in the center, with General Ulysses S. Grant to his left. Swing Around the Circle refers to a disastrous speaking campaign undertaken by United States President Andrew Johnson between August 27 and September 15, 1866, in which he tried to gain support for his mild Reconstruction policies and for his preferred candidates (mostly Democrats) in the forthcoming midterm Congressional elections. The tour's nickname came from the route that the campaign took: \\"Washington, D.C., to New York, west to Chicago, south to St. Louis, and east through the Ohio River valley back to the nation's capital\\". Johnson undertook the speaking tour in the face of increasing opposition in the Northern states and in Washington to his lenient form of Reconstruction in the South, which had led the Southern states largely to revert to the social system that had predominated before the Civil War. Although he believed he could regain the trust of moderate Northern Republicans by exploiting tensions between them and their Radical counterparts on the tour, Johnson only alienated them more. This caused a supporter of Johnson to say of the tour that it would have been better \\"had it never been made.\\"https://books.google.com/books?id=FhvA0S_op38C&pg;=PA265&lpg;=PA265&dq;=%22million+northern+votes%22&source;=bl&ots;=rWlMKhgIXI&sig;=aHLarsTO-38BVrOoddlBauUa- cI&hl;=en&ei;=F3q5SeTQK56wMbDX4LkI&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=1&ct;=result#PPA264,M1 Foner, Eric. Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution. Perennial Classics. p.264-265 The tour eventually became the centerpiece of the tenth article of impeachment against Johnson. Background Johnson had first intended his approach to Reconstruction as a delivery of predecessor Abraham Lincoln's promise to benevolently \\"bind up the nation's wounds\\" after the war was won. However, as Congress began enacting legislation to guarantee the rights of former slaves, former slaveowner Johnson refocused on actions (including vetoes of civil rights legislation and mass pardoning of former Confederate officials) that resulted in severe oppression of freed slaves in the Southern states, as well as the return of high-ranking Confederate officials and pre-war aristocrats to power in state and federal government. The policies had infuriated the Radical Republicans in Congress and gradually alienated the moderates, who along with Democrats had been Johnson's base of congressional support, to the point that by 1866 the Congress had gathered enough antipathy towards the President to enact the first override of a Presidential veto in over twenty years, salvaging a bill that extended the life of the Freedmen's Bureau. Johnson also managed to alienate his own cabinet, three members of which resigned in disgust in 1866. Thus the elections that year were viewed as a referendum on Johnson himself, who had not been elected President but had acceded to power upon Lincoln's murder. However, in Johnson's earlier political campaigns he had earned a reputation as a masterful stump speaker, and to that end he determined to undertake a political speaking tour (which at that time was unprecedented for a sitting President). His two dedicated supporters in the cabinet, Secretary of State William Seward and Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, joined him on the tour. In addition, to increase both his audience and his prestige, Johnson brought along heroes of the Civil War such as David Farragut, George Custer, and Ulysses S. Grant (by then the most admired living man in the country) to stand next to him while he spoke. The tour =Initial success= In the 18 days of the tour, Johnson and his entourage made stops in Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New York City, West Point, Albany, Auburn, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Springfield, and Alton, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; and Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as well as short stops in smaller towns between. Because Presidents had traditionally not undertaken political campaigning in the past, Johnson's action was seen even before he began as undignified and beneath the office. Johnson's advisors, aware that the President could get carried away in his own sentiments, pleaded with him to give only carefully prepared speeches; Johnson, as he had often done on the campaign trail, instead prepared a rough outline around which he could spontaneously speak. Once he began, however, the fiery oratory that had once helped his political fortunes now sank them. Initially, Johnson was enthusiastically received, particularly in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. According to Johnson biographer Hans Trefousse, at each stop on the tour he had delivered The press nonetheless gave him overwhelmingly positive coverage throughout the first leg of the tour (although the circumstances made his customary introduction‚Äî\\"Fellow citizens, it is not for the purpose of making speeches that I now appear before you\\"‚Äîa particular laugh line). However, when Johnson entered the Radical Republican strongholds of the Midwest, he began facing much more hostile crowds, some drawn by reports of his prior speeches and others organized by Republican leadership in those towns. =Disaster= Johnson's stop in Cleveland on September 3 marked the turning point in the tour. Because the audience was as large as it had been at previous stops, nothing seemed out of the ordinary; however, the crowd included mobs of hecklers, many of them plants by the Radical Republicans, who goaded Johnson into engaging them in mid-speech; when one of them yelled \\"Hang Jeff Davis!\\" in Cleveland, Johnson angrily replied, \\"Why don't you hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips?\\"Foner, p.265. When he left the balcony from which he had spoken, reporters heard supporters reminding Johnson to maintain his dignity; Johnson's reply of \\"I don't care about my dignity\\" was carried in newspapers across the nation, abruptly ending the tour's favorable press. Subsequent to this and other vituperative appearances in southern Michigan, the Illinois governor Richard J. Oglesby refused to attend Johnson's September 7 Chicago stop, as did the Chicago city council. Johnson nonetheless fared well in Chicago, presenting only a short and pre-written speech. However, his temper got the better of him once more in St. Louis on September 9. Provoked by a heckler, Johnson accused Radical Republicans of deliberately inciting the deadly New Orleans Riot that summer; again compared himself to Jesus, and the Republicans to his betrayers; and defending himself against unmade accusations of tyranny. The following day in Indianapolis, the crowd was so hostile and loud that Johnson was unable to speak at all; even after he retreated, violence and gunfire broke out in the streets between Johnson supporters and opponents, resulting in one man's death. At other points in Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, spectators drowned out Johnson with calls for Grant, who refused to speak, and for \\"Three cheers for Congress!\\" =Tragedy= Finally, on September 14 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a temporary platform built beside the railroad tracks for the president's appearance gave way, sending hundreds into a drained canal 20 feet below, killing thirteen. Though Johnson attempted to halt the train and use it for triage for the injured, it could not wait (due to conflicting train traffic). A few members of the presidential party left the train to assist the victims, but Johnson and the rest of the party continued onto Harrisburg. To appearances, Johnson had callously abandoned the scene of massive casualties. Johnson gave $500 ($8,318 in 2016 dollars) to assist the victims. Reaction \\"Andy's Trip,\\" a lampooning of Johnson's \\"Swing Around the Circle\\" campaign tour by cartoonist Thomas Nast The press excoriated Johnson badly for his disastrous appearances and speeches. The New York Herald, previously the most supportive newspaper for Johnson in the entire country, stated that \\"It is mortifying to see a man occupying the lofty position of President of the United States descend from that position and join issue with those who are draggling their garments in the muddy gutters of political vituperation.\\" The president was also the target of the two most important satirical journalists of the era‚Äîhumorist David Ross Locke (writing in his persona as the backward southerner Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby) and cartoonist Thomas Nast, who created three large illustrations lampooning Johnson and the Swing that became legendary. Johnson's Republican opponents took quick advantage of their good political fortune. Thaddeus Stevens gave a speech referring to the Swing as \\"the remarkable circus that traveled through the country\\" that \\"cut outside the circle and entered into street brawls with common blackguards.\\" Charles Sumner, meanwhile, gave a stump speech of his own, encouraging his audiences to vote for Republicans in the fall elections because \\"the President must be taught that usurpation and apostasy cannot prevail.\\" Radical Republicans also began spreading rumors that Johnson had been drunk at several appearances. Because Johnson had been visibly and verifiably drunk at his own inauguration as vice president the year before, reporters and political opponents took his inebriation as fact and declared him a \\"vulgar, drunken demagogue who was disgracing the presidency.\\" Johnson's supporters, too, gave negative reactions to the tour, with former Georgia Governor Herschel V. Johnson writing that the President had \\"[sacrificed] the moral power of his position, and done great damage to the cause of Constitutional Reorganization.\\"Foner, p.265. James Doolittle, a Senator from Wisconsin, lamented that the tour had \\"cost Johnson one million northern voters.\\"Foner, p.265 Aftermath A cartoon depicting Johnson's loss of political strength as a result of his Swing Around the Circle speaking tour. By the time he returned to Washington from the speaking tour, Johnson had even less support in the North than he had started with. His only remaining allies in Congress were Southern Democrats; since these were mostly former rebels, Johnson's reputation was diminished yet further by association. The Republican party would go on to a landslide victory in the congressional elections, and the new Congress would wrest control of Reconstruction from the White House with the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. Johnson openly defied Congress and fought them bitterly for the control of the nation's domestic policy. However, the Republicans' vastly increased congressional voting bloc not only afforded them the political power to keep Johnson at bay, it gave the party sufficient votes to attempt impeachment of Johnson, first unsuccessfully in 1867 and again successfully in 1868. The Swing Around the Circle's impact was apparent even in the articles of impeachment, with the tenth of 11 articles charging that the President \\"did...make and declare, with a loud voice certain intemperate, inflammatory, and scandalous harangues, and therein utter loud threats and bitter menaces, as well against Congress as the laws of the United States duly enacted thereby, amid the cries, jeers and laughter of the multitudes then assembled in hearing.\\" Articles of impeachment presented against President Andrew Johnson However, the impeachment managers neglected to bring this article to a vote in the Senate when it became clear that it had no support. The Republicans captured the White House in 1868 and maintained control of it until 1885, although Congress would continue to be the dominant force in government until the end of the 19th Century. Thus, in effect, the Swing Around the Circle began a long series of political defeats that crippled Johnson, the Democratic Party and the presidency for several years.

The community was founded in 1995 and established as a personal parish in 1999 by Archbishop John Francis Donaghue. The church (building) was purchased in 1999 and consecrated by Archbishop Donaghue in 2000.  Liturgy  All of the Sacraments at St. Francis de Sales are celebrated according to the Roman Missal of 1962. Two Masses are generally celebrated every weekday, while three are celebrated on Sunday, one of which is a High Mass. History St. Francis de Sales is a Latin Rite parish serving the Archdiocese of Atlanta, which was separated in 1956 from the Diocese of Savannah. Permission for Mass according to the rubrics of 1962 was initially given by Archbishop James P. Lyke and renewed by Archbishop John Francis Donoghue. The reinstatement of the Rite began at Holy Spirit parish in Buckhead and later moved to Sacred Heart Church with the support of its pastor, Fr. Stephen Churchwell. In 1994 the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter began saying the Latin Mass at Sacred Heart. The St. Francis de Sales Latin Mass Community was founded in 1995 with the arrival of a full-time priest. A rectory was soon established in Alpharetta and the Sunday Mass was moved to St. Joseph's Maronite Church in Atlanta. In 1998, the community was hosted at Sts. Peter and Paul Parish where a Sunday Mass at the Kelly & Leak Funeral Home was added. St. Francis de Sales finally found a permanent home the following year, in Mableton. The former Grace Baptist Church was purchased and the first Mass said in the new home in January. The community was also elevated to the status of a parish in January 1999, and Rev. Mark F. Fischer, FSSP, was named the founding pastor. He was later joined by Rev. Paul Roman, FSSP, and then later by Rev. Nicholas Zolnerowicz, a priest of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, who served as parochial vicar until his retirement in 2003. He died in 2008. In the spring of 2003, Rev. Robert Fromageot, FSSP became pastor, but in July 2004 he left to pursue a degree in moral theology in Rome. Rev. Denis G. Bouchard, FSSP, assisted by Rev. Laurent Demets, FSSP, replaced him as pastor until February 2008, when he was transferred to another FSSP apostolate, at which time Fr. Mark Fischer, the founding pastor, returned to the parish. He remained there until July 2010, when Fr. Howard Venette, FSSP, arrived. Fr. Venette would remain there until 2012, when he was transferred to another apostolate. Fr. Matthew McCarthy, FSSP, who was parochial vicar at that time, became pastor, and would remain so until 2017, when he was replaced by Fr. Carlos Casavantes, FSSP. A year later, in 2018, Fr. Casavantes was transferred, and would be replaced by Fr. Joseph DeGuzman, formerly parochial vicar, as pastor. Fr. Robert Dow would replace Fr. DeGuzman as pastor in 2020. Fr. Demets served at the parish as parochial vicar from 2003‚Äì2007, when he left to serve an FSSP community in the Diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas. He was succeeded by Fr. Roberto Cano, FSSP, from 2007‚Äì2009, then by Fr. Thomas Fritschen, FSSP (2009‚Äì2010), Fr. Christopher Pelster, FSSP (2011), Fr. Matthew McCarthy, FSSP (2011-2012), Fr.

The city of Lowell was started in the 1820s as a money-making venture and social project referred to as \\"The Lowell Experiment\\", and quickly became the United States' largest textile center. However, within approximately a century, the decline and collapse of that industry in New England placed the city into a deep recession. Lowell's \\"rebirth\\", partially tied to Lowell National Historical Park, has made it a model for other former industrial towns, although the city continues to struggle with deindustrialization and suburbanization. Lowell is considered the \\"Cradle of the American Industrial Revolution\\", as it was the first large-scale factory town in the country. Pre-colonial history and founding John Eliot, the missionary who made the first formal contact with the Pawtucket and Wamesit tribes. The area around what is now Lowell was an important hub for the Pennacook Indians. The land above the Pawtucket Falls on the northern bank of the Merrimack was inhabited by the Pawtucket group, while the land along both sides of the Concord River was inhabited by the Wamesits. The site of Lowell itself (and a portion of Dracut) served as the location of both the Pawtucket and Wamesit capitals, primarily due to the availability of salmon at Pawtucket Falls and the transportation system provided by the local network of rivers. At the time that the colonists first substantively encountered the tribes, Daniel Gookin that they had a combined population of 12,000, with 3,000 living in the capital. The first interactions between the colonists and the Pawtucket group occurred through trade and religious conversion. During the 1640s, Major Simon Willard traded extensively with the tribes, and in 1647 was accompanied in his expedition by the noted preacher John Eliot. Eliot returned a year later, and quickly founded a church there with a native convert named Samuel as the pastor. A dedicated church building was built in 1653, remaining until 1824, when it was demolished. Colonists began to move closer to the native tribes with the founding of Chelmsford in 1653. Subsequent grants of land extended the town to cover most of the territory Lowell now occupies, with the exception of 500 acres of farmland reserved for the Pawtucket. The colonists began actively buying land from the Pawtucket, trading those 500 acres for the island of Wickassee above the Pawtucket Falls, and the hysteria generated by King Philip's War weakened both the tribe and its relations with the colonists. By the time the war ended in 1676, the community was much reduced. Wannalancit, the son of Passaconaway and the Pawtucket leader after his father's retirement, took the surviving tribesmen and moved to Wickassee before selling the land in 1686. The tribe moved to Canada, wandering with the Abenaki before briefly returning in 1692 to negotiate with hostile tribes on behalf of Chelmsford during King William's War. The final parts of Pawtucket territory were finally purchased in the early 18th century, with a deed issued in 1714 removing their last legal claim and the annexation of \\"Indian town\\" in 1726. With that, what is now Lowell became entirely colonist-owned, existing as part of the towns of Chelmsford and Dracut. Early industrialization Paul Moody Entrepreneurs and industrialists soon began using Chelmsford as a location for new mills and manufacturing plants. The presence of Pawtucket Falls offered a source of water power that enabled the construction of a sawmill and gristmill in the early 18th century, followed by a fulling mill in 1737. The region's forests made it an attractive area for logging, but necessitated a way of shipping lumber down the river. The Pawtucket Falls made this difficult, as they included a 32-foot drop. In 1792, the Proprietors of Locks and Canals association was formed, and completed a canal to bypass Pawtucket Falls in 1797. This would allow the shipping of lumber and other products to the shipyards at Newburyport. Unfortunately the creation of the Middlesex Canal, which formed a direct route to Boston, severely harmed the Pawtucket Canal's prospects, and it swiftly fell into disuse. Francis Cabot Lowell, an American businessman and textile merchant, visited Britain in 1810 to investigate their textile machinery. Because British law prohibited the export of the machines, Lowell instead memorized the designs, and on his return helped build a replica. In 1813 he organised the Boston Manufacturing Company and created a cotton mill in Waltham, Massachusetts. This mill was the first one in America to use power looms, and proved so successful that Patrick Jackson (Lowell's successor after his death in 1817) saw a need to open a new plant. Waltham had been chosen due to the power provided by the Charles River, and Jackson chose to use Pawtucket Falls to power the second plant. The creation of the canal did, however, provide Chelmsford with a convenient source of water for manufacturing purposes; a series of small cotton and gunpowder manufacturing businesses sprung up, using the canal as a water power source. Jackson and others founded the Merrimack Manufacturing Company to open a mill by Pawtucket Falls, breaking ground in 1822 and completing the first run of cotton in 1823. Within two years a need for more mills and machinery became evident, and a series of new canals were dug, allowing for even more manufacturing plants. With a growing population and booming economy, Lowell was finally spun off from Chelmsford. Named after Francis Cabot Lowell, it was officially chartered on March 1, 1826, with a population of 2,500. Within a decade the population jumped from 2,500 to 18,000, and on April 1, 1836, the town of Lowell officially received a charter as a city, granted by the Massachusetts General Court. City of Lowell Lowell's canal system - today Lowell was only the third Massachusetts community to be granted city government, after Boston and Salem. The population at the time was 17,633, and soon, a court, jail, hospital, cemetery, library, and two town commons were established. The first museums and theatres opened around 1840. Lowell also began annexing neighboring areas, including Belvidere from Tewksbury in 1834, and Centralville from Dracut in 1851. Daniel Ayer started the satellite city of Ayer's City in South Lowell in 1847, and in 1874, Pawtucketville and Middlesex Village were annexed from Dracut and Chelmsford respectively, bringing the city close to its present borders. Father John's Medicine By 1850, Lowell's population was 33,000, making it the second largest city in Massachusetts and America's largest industrial center. The 5.6 mile long canal system produced 10,000 horsepower, being provided to ten corporations with a total of forty mills. Ten thousand workers used an equal number of looms fed by 320,000 spindles. The mills were producing 50,000 miles of cloth annually. Other industries developed in Lowell as well: The Lowell Machine Shop and Father John's Medicine opened. Tanneries, a bleachery, and service companies needed by the growing city were established. Moxie, an early soft drink, was invented in Lowell in the 1870s. Around 1880, Lowell became the first city in America to have telephone numbers. Middlesex Village Marker- Annexed from Chelmsford in 1874. Lowell continued to be in the forefront of new industrial technology. In 1828, Paul Moody developed an early belt-driven power transfer system to supersede the unreliable gearwork that was utilized at the time. In 1830, Patrick Tracy Jackson commissioned work on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, one of the Oldest railroads in North America. It opened five years became independent in 1845, patent medicine factories like Hood's Sarsaparilla Laboratory later, making the Middlesex Canal obsolete. Soon, lines up the Merrimack to Nashua, downriver to Lawrence, and inland to Groton Junction, today known as Ayer (renamed after Lowell patent medicine tycoon Dr. James Cook Ayer), were constructed. Uriah A. Boyden installed his first turbine in the Appleton Mill in 1844,Appleton's Dictionary of Machines, Mechanics, Enginework, and Engineering, Volume 2 (Google eBook) D. Appleton & Company, 1869 Page 882 which was a major efficiency improvement over the old-fashioned waterwheel. The turbine was improved at Lowell again shortly thereafter by Englishman James B. Francis, chief engineer of Proprietors of Locks and Canals. Francis had begun his career with Locks and Canals working under George Washington Whistler, the father of painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and his improved turbine, known as the Francis Turbine, is still used with few changes today. Francis also designed the Francis Gate, a flood control mechanism that provides a means of sealing the canal system off from the Merrimack River, and completed the canal system by adding the Northern Canal and Moody Street Feeder, both designed to improve efficiency to the entire system. To further improve the amount of year-round, day and night water power Lowell needed, Francis, along with engineers from Lawrence, were involved with The Lake Company, a corporation involved in building dams in the Lakes Region of Central New Hampshire. These dams, constructed and improved mid-century, allowed the cities on the Merrimack River to store and release water from the Merrimack's source, including Lake Winnipesaukee. In the late 19th century, new technologies changed Lowell. The electric streetcar allowed the city to expand creating new neighborhoods on the outskirts. Tyler Park and Lynde Hill in Belvidere were home to many of Lowell's wealthiest residents, who could now live away from the noisy and polluted downtown industrial area. The prosperous city built a massive new Romanesque city hall made of granite with a clock tower that could be seen from the mill-yards. A new library with a hall dedicated to the Civil War, a post office, and ornate commercial buildings replaced the puritanical mid-century structures. Steam power was first used to supplement the fully developed hydropower sources in Lowell in the 1860s, and by the mid-1870s, it was the dominant energy source. Electricity allowed the mills to run on hydroelectricity, instead of direct- drive hydropower. These improvements allowed Lowell to continue increasing its industrial output with a lesser increase in the number of workers. However, the move away from pure hydropower was leading to Lowell being eclipsed by cities with better locations for the new power sources. For example, in the 50 years after the Civil War, Fall River, Massachusetts and New Bedford, Massachusetts both became larger factory towns than Lowell based on output. The reason was largely because their seaport locations made the importation and exportation of goods and materials, and particularly coal, more economical than the considerably inland, and therefore only accessible by train, Lowell. By 1920, it was being seriously suggested that the Merrimack be dredged from Newburyport to Lowell so that barges could access the city.Frederick Coburn, History of Lowell and its People V1 However, the events of the 1920s ensured that would never happen. In 1885 was founded the Lowell Co-operative Bank, today Sage Bank, one of the oldest still functioning banks in Massachusetts. Panorama of the city in 1918 Immigration Being a booming city with many low-skilled jobs, waves of immigrants came into Lowell to work the mills. The original 30 Irish that came to help build the canals were led by Hugh Cummiskey along the Middlesex canal from Charleston to Pawtucket Falls on foot April 6, 1822. They were met by Kirk Boott and given a pittance. No allowance was made for housing or other provisioning. These were followed by a new group after the Irish Potato Famine, and later Catholic Germans. These Irish were herded onto land that was not under the control of the mills into an area now called \\"The Acre\\" - but at that point called \\"Paddy Camp Lands\\".cotton was king Ethnic tensions - sometimes stoked by mill companies seeking to use members of one community as strikebreakers against members of another - were not unheard of, and in the 1840s, the nativist, anti-Catholic American Party (often called the Know-Nothing Party) won elections in Lowell. By the 1850s, industry competition increased as more manufacturing centers were built elsewhere, Lowell's mills employed increasing numbers of immigrant families, and the early \\"Lowell System\\" of Yankee women workers living in company boardinghouses was transformed. In its place, large, densely populated ethnic neighborhoods grew around the city, their residents more rooted in their churches, organizations, and communities than the previous era's company boardinghouse dwellers. The American Civil War shut down many of the mills temporarily when they sold off their cotton stockpiles, which had become more valuable than the finished cloth after imports from the South had stopped. Many jobs were lost, but the effect was somewhat mitigated by the number of men serving in the military. Lowell had a small historical place in the war: Many wool Union uniforms were made in Lowell, General Benjamin Franklin Butler was from the city, and members of the Lowell-based Massachusetts Sixth‚ÄîLadd, Whitney, Taylor, and Needham‚Äîwere the first four Union deaths, killed in a riot while passing through Baltimore on their way to Washington, DC. Ladd, Whitney, and later Taylor are buried in front of City Hall under a large obelisk. After the war, mills returned to life. Recruiters fanned out all over New England for help. New mill hands were often new widows, mothers in single parent families. By August 1865, this source dried up. New immigrant groups moved into the city. In the 1870s and 1880s, French Canadians began moving into an area which became known as Little Canada. Later French Canadian immigrants included the parents of famed Beat generation writer Jack Kerouac, a native of the city. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the early 20th century, Greeks moved into the sections of the old Irish Acre. Other Groups such as the Portuguese, Polish, Lithuanians and Swedes as well as Jews came to work in Lowell and settled their own neighborhoods throughout Lowell. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, approximately 50 percent of Lowell's 110,000 residents were foreign born.http://ecommunity.uml.edu/lhs/lowell_history2.htm Decline Commuters waiting for a bus, January 1941, at the old main train station, where the Lord Overpass is today. By the 1920s, the New England textile industry began to shift South and many of Lowell's textile mills began to move or close. Although the South did not have rivers capable of providing the waterpower needed to run the early mills, the advent of steam-powered factories allowed companies to take advantage of the cheaper labor and transportation costs available there. Labor strikes in the North became more frequent, and severe ones like the 1912 Bread and Roses Strike in neighboring Lawrence were driving up costs for investors. Many textile companies changed to a policy of disinvestment, running the mills with no capital improvements until they were no longer capable of producing profit that could be used to build or improve new factories elsewhere. In 1916, the Bigelow Carpet Company, which had previously purchased the Lowell Manufacturing Company, left Lowell. This was the first of the major corporations to move operations to the South or go bankrupt. World War I briefly improved the situation, but from 1926 to 1929, most of the rest of the companies, including the Lowell Machine Shop (which had become the Saco-Lowell Shops) left the city: The Great Depression had come to Lowell early. In 1930, Lowell's population was slightly over 100,000, down from a high of 112,000 a decade earlier. The textile industry employed 8,000 in 1936, it had been 17,000 in 1900. By the onset of World War II, 40% of the city's population was on relief. World War II again briefly helped the economy, since not only did demand for clothing go up, but Lowell was involved in munitions manufacturing. After the war, things cooled again. In 1956, the Boott Mills closed, and after over 130 years, the Merrimack Manufacturing Company closed in 1958. Bottoming out View of the former \\"Mile of Mills\\" along the Merrimack River. From left to right, the white tower is the former Lowell Sun offices in Kearney Square, below that is Apartments at Massachusetts Mills. At the point where the smaller Concord River joins the Merrimack, these crumbling buildings formerly belonged to the Massachusetts Mills. Heading upriver, crossing the Merrimack is the Bridge Street Bridge, followed by the largely rehabilitated Boott Mills, then on the site where the Merrimack Manufacturing Company once stood are the River Place Towers. The Tsongas Arena is hidden next door, and in the distance, the smokestacks of the former Lawrence and Suffolk Manufacturing Companies. By the mid-1970s, Lowell's population had fallen to 91,000, and 12% of residents were unemployed. The industrial economy of the city had been reduced to many smaller scale, marginal businesses. The city's infrastructure and buildings were largely over one hundred years old, obsolete and decaying, often abandoned and in foreclosure. Urban renewal demolished many historic structures in a desperate attempt to improve the overall situation in Lowell. In 1939, the Greek Acre was the first district in the nation to face \\"slum clearance\\" with Federal Urban Renewal money. In the late 1950s, Little Canada was bulldozed. In 1960, the Merrimack Manufacturing Company's millyard and boardinghouses were demolished to make way for warehouses and public housing projects. Other neighborhoods like Hale-Howard between Thorndike and Chelmsford Streets, and an area between Gorham and South Streets, were cleared as well. Arson became a serious issue, and crime in general rose. Lowell's reputation suffered tremendously. As the car took over American life after World War II, the downtown, which already was facing problems due to a drop in expendable income, was largely vacated as business moved to suburban shopping malls. The theatres and department stores left, and much smaller enterprises moved in if anything. Many buildings were torn down for parking lots, and many others burned down, and were not replaced. Others had their top floors removed to reduce tax bills and many facades were \\"modernized\\" destroying the Victorian character of the downtown. Road widening and other improvements destroyed a row of business next to city hall, as well as the area that has become the Lord Overpass. The construction of the Lowell Connector around 1960 was surprisingly unintrusive for an urban interstate, but that was only because plans to extend it to East Merrimack Street by way of Back Central and the Concord Riverfront were cancelled. Talk began on filling in the canals to make more real estate. Officials described the city as looking like Europe after World War II. However, the demolition and decay of much of what had made Lowell a vibrant city led some residents to begin thinking about saving the historical structures. National Park The Boott Mill complex now converted to a museum. Lowell, even as far back as the 1860s, was describedby local historian Charles Cowley as a city with little civic pride. At the time, Cowley attributed it to a large percentage of the population being foreign born and therefore having no real roots there. Post its industrial collapse, that sentiment intensified, even if the reasons had changed. Many residents of Lowell viewed the city's industrial history poorly - the factories had abandoned their workers, and now sat empty and in disrepair. However, some city residents, such as educator Patrick J Mogan, viewed the city's history as something that should be preserved and capitalized on. In 1974, Lowell Heritage State Park was founded, and in 1978, Lowell National Historical Park was created as an urban national park, through legislation filed by Lowell native, congressman, and later senator Paul Tsongas. The canal system, many mills, and some commercial structures downtown were saved by the creation of the park and the visitors it brought. The Massachusetts Miracle brought new jobs and money to the city in the 1980s. Wang Laboratories became a major employer, and built their world headquarters on the edge of the city. After the Vietnam War and the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, many Southeast Asians, and particularly Cambodians moved into the city. Lowell became the largest Cambodian community on the east coast, and second nationally to Long Beach, California.http://www.khmerinstitute.org/musings/mu3.html Combined with other immigrant groups like Puerto Ricans, these newcomers brought the city's population back up to six figures. However, this prosperity was short-lived. By 1990, the Massachusetts Miracle was over, Wang had virtually disappeared, and even more of Lowell's long-established businesses failed. Around this time, the last large department store left downtown Lowell, largely blamed on suburban factors, including a large mall built a short drive away in tax-free New Hampshire in the mid-1980s, followed by another large mall, also a short drive away and in New Hampshire, in the early 1990s. Additionally, gang violence and the drug trade had become severe. The HBO special, High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell was filmed in 1995 which tended to emphasize the reputation of the city as a dangerous and depressed place to be. Modern era Aside from the National Historical Park, Lowell is a functioning modern city of over 100,000 residents. Numerous initiatives have taken place over the last fifteen years to re-focus the city away from manufacturing, and towards a post-industrial economy. =Community Development= New groups have moved into Lowell's neighborhoods, including Brazilians and Africans, continuing Lowell's traditional role as a melting pot. A project that will redevelop land once held by the Saco-Lowell Shops and the Hamilton and Appleton Mills was underway in 2009.http://www.hamiltoncanal.com/ Numerous projects are being undertaken around the city, to beautify and redevelop decaying areas.http://www.lowellma.gov/depts/dpd/projects/index_html/ =Tourism and Entertainment= The Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell and LeLacheur Park were constructed in 1998. Lowell Devils hockey and Lowell Spinners baseball farm teams came to the city. National circuit entertainment is performed at the arena and at the old Lowell Memorial Auditorium. The Lowell Folk Festival, the largest free folk festival in the country, is an annual event. The National Park has continued to expand; many buildings are still being rehabilitated. After Massachusetts started offering a tax credit to those who film in the Commonwealth, a few movies have been made in Lowell. The Invention of Lying was released in September 2009, and shortly before, filming on The Fighter, about Lowell boxing legend Micky Ward and his older brother Dicky Eklund, was completed. =Education= The University of Massachusetts Lowell and Middlesex Community College are playing increasingly larger roles in the city. In 2009, UMass Lowell bought up the underutilized Doubletree hotel for use as a dormitory, increasing their presence in the city's downtown.http://www.uml.edu/Media/News%20Articles/UML_Purchases_Double.html See also * Timeline of Lowell, Massachusetts Footnotes References   External links * City of Lowell * Lowell National Historical Park * University of Massachusetts Lowell, Center for Lowell History * Map of Lowell in 1924 * Wall & Gray. 1871 Atlas of Massachusetts.

It is perched above Rait, three miles (5 km) north-east of Errol, in the Braes of the Carse, on the fringes of the Sidlaw Hills. Thus it overlooks both the Carse of Gowrie and the Firth of Tay and beyond into the Kingdom of Fife. The name derives from Gaelic fionn-gasg: a white or light-coloured appendage. Fingask was once an explicitly holy place, a convenient and numinous stop-off between the abbeys at Falkirk and Scone. It was later held by the Bruce family, and then by the Threiplands. In the eighteenth century it was owned by Jacobites and was forfeited (stolen by the Government). The castle is a Category B listed building, and the estate is included on the Inventory of Historic Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.

History There are mentions of the lands of Fingask in the Foundation Charter of the Abbey of Scone by Alexander I. The date of the charter is said to be 1114 or 1115.Liber de Scon, p.2 The Bruce family owned the lands of Rait, including Fingask, from the 15th century. The Bruces were descended from the senior line of the Bruces of Clackmannan, which included Sir David Bruce who married Janet, daughter of Sir William Stirling of Keir. Their son, Robert Bruce held charter of Rate (Rait) in 1484, confirmed 1488, and his son David resigned his right to Clackmannan to his uncle in February 1506/7. At the time when Patrick Bruce was laird, a stone was set into the house showing the date 1594. A tombstone near the ruined church of Rait reveals: The last of the Bruce lairds of Fingask was Laurence Bruce, whose \\"pecuniary involvements necessitated the sale of the estate for the behoof of his creditors in the year 1671\\".Melville, p.119 =Threipland baronets= Detail of William Delacour's painting of Dr. Sir Stuart Threipland, of Fingask (1716‚Äì1805), physician to Bonnie Prince Charlie during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and President of the Royal Medical Society from 1766‚Äì1770 In 1672 Patrick Threipland purchased the estate, which was erected into a barony the same year. He renovated the building and laid out the gardens, and in 1674 he added the neighbouring Braes of the Carse tower house and estate of Kinnaird to his realm. The same year he was knighted for his diligence in the suppression of conventiclers, and in 1687 he was created a baronet of Nova Scotia, although he died a prisoner at Stirling Castle for adherence to the ousted King James VII, in 1689. His son David, 2nd Baronet, (c.1670‚Äì1746) joined the Jacobite rising of 1715, and fought with the Earl of Mar against the government at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. When the rising failed, the baronetcy was attainted by act of parliament and Fingask and its estate was forfeited. Fingask was purchased for ¬£9,606 6s 4.5d by the York Buildings Company, an English waterworks company which had begun to specialise in forfeited land. The company held the property until 1783, meanwhile leasing it to Dame Katherine (Kattrin) Threipland, \\"the lass of Gowrie\\" (d. 18 March 1762), daughter of the 2nd baronet. Fingask Castle was badly damaged in 1745 by government troops, as the Threiplands once more supported the Jacobites in the second Jacobite rising. David Threipland (1694‚Äì1745), son of the 2nd baronet, was killed at the Battle of Prestonpans. His half-brother Dr. Stuart Threipland (1716‚Äì1805), repurchased Fingask in 1783 at a sale of forfeited land, for ¬£12,207. He married firstly at St. Paul's, Edinburgh, in 1753, Jannet, daughter of David Sinclair of Southdun, Caithness, and secondly at St. Paul's Edinburgh, in 1761, Jannet daughter of Richard Murray of Pennyland, heiress of her cousin Grizel Budge (d. 1798) of Dale & Toftingall, Halkirk, Caithness. His sister Miss Euphame (\\"Aunt Effie\\") Threipland (1713- ) is said to have run the estate in his absence. Dr Threipland was President of the Royal Medical Society from 1766. Steuart and Peter Threipland's Q. Horatii Flacci Opera, Ludovicus Desprez, London, 1699 Bookplate of Sir Patrick Budge Murray Threipland, 4th Bart. (1762‚Äì1837), in a copy of a 1761 Book of Common Prayer In 1826, the attainder of 1715 was repealed by Act of Parliament, and Sir Patrick (aka Peter) Budge Murray Threipland (1762‚Äì1837), an advocate, was restored to the dignity of a baronet. He later served as Deputy Lieutenant for Perthshire and Caithness. In 1792 he married his first cousin once-removed Jessy (d. 1855), daughter of William Scott Kerr of Chatto or Thirlestane. Her grandmother was a daughter of Sir David Threipland, 2nd Bt., by his first wife. Between 1828 and 1831 Sir Patrick added to the front west part of the house. Embellishment and building onto the south front continued until 1840. Sir Patrick-Murray (aka Peter) Threipland, 5th Bt (1800‚Äì1882), was educated in Edinburgh and Paris. He served as a major in the Perth militia, retiring in 1843, and was a Commissioner for Supply for the counties of Perth and Caithness. He was also a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of Perth and Caithness. Before and after his mother died in 1855 he lived at Fingask with his three elder sisters. The UK Census of 31 March 1851 records a staff of seven at Fingask: Housekeeper (Jean Oswald); Ladies Maid (Mary Gray); Cook (Margaret Stewart); Sir Peter's House Maid (Mary McLagan); Butler (David Chalmers); Footman (John Bertram); and Coachman (Andrew David). Mrs Drummond of Megginch Castle described the family: When Miss Jessie died in May 1871, Mrs Drummond reported that the \\"life of the old house went out\\". On the death of Sir Patrick in 1882, the Threipland Baronetcy became dormant. Fingask was left to his first cousin's second son, William Scott Kerr, who subsequently changed his name to William Murray Threipland. In 1915 he was appointed to command the newly raised Welsh Guards, and became Colonel of the regiment in 1937. =Other owners= Sir Patrick Murray Threipland, 5th Baronet (1800‚Äì1882), attributed to Sir John Watson Gordon (95 x 60 inches). The castle passed out of the Threipland family again in 1917, when it was bought by whisky merchant Sir John Henderson Stewart, 1st Baronet. In 1917 the Fingask estate was made up of . This comprised arable , hill , and woods . The rental of the Fingask, and those of the much smaller estates of Kinnaird, and Inchmichael (which he had added), had given Sir John an annual rental return of ¬£4,000. Sir John became heavily indebted due to the Prohibition of alcohol in the United States, and committed suicide at Fingask on 6 February 1924. The estate was bought by H. B. Gilroy of Ballumbie in 1925. The house was saved from ruin but wholly re-modelled, all spiral staircases removed and nineteenth-century frontal additions demolished. =Return to the Threipland family= In 1969 the estate returned to the Threipland family, when it was bought by Mark Stepney Murray Threipland, grandson of Colonel William Murray Threipland. He was the son of Patrick Murray Threipland and Marged Howard Stepney (a descendant of the 2nd Lord De Tabley and Jerome de Salis, amongst many others). By this time the estate had been reduced to . In 1996 Fingask was bought by Andrew Murray Threipland, son of Patrick Murray Threipland and Leslie McNair Scott. In 2020, Threipland revealed plans to transform part of the estate known as Witches Knowe into a barrow cemetery, with over one thousand burial plots, as well as creating a semi-underground candle-lit chamber in which relatives can deposit the ashes of their relatives.\\"Castle's owner wants to create barrow cemetery\\" - The Courier, 5 May, 2020 Portraits of people associated with Fingask, and the Threipland shield in 1880 File:SirDavidThreipland.jpgSir David Threipland (1666‚Äì1746), 2nd Bart., as a boy File:LassofGowrie.jpgDame Katherine (c. 1679‚Äì1762), daughter of David Smythe of Barnhill, and second wife to Sir David Threipland File:Stuart Threipland after the Battle of Culloden, by William Delacour.jpgDr. (Sir) Stuart Threipland File:CharlesSpenceTheCarsePoet.jpgCharles Spence (1779‚Äì1869); the Bard of Gowrie, the Poet of the Carse, footman and mason to the Threiplands File:JessyScott_Kerr.jpgJessy Scott Kerr married her cousin Sir Patrick Threipland in 1792.

Between 1828 and 1840 additions were made to the south and west of the castle. Sir Patrick Threipland, 4th Baronet (1762‚Äì1837) laid out the park, and his son planted the topiary gardens and installed statuary.

A Wine Miscellany, pp. 5-9. Clarkson Potter Publishing (New York), 2005. . Within the United States, wine may include the fermented juice of any fruit26 U.S.C. ¬ß5381: \\"Natural wine\\".

Title 27: Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ¬ß4.21: \\"The standards of identity: Class 5; Fruit wine\\" & \\"Class 6; Wine from other agricultural products\\". Accessed 9 November 2013. Other jurisdictions have similar rules dictating the range of products qualifying as \\"wine\\".  By appellation  Historically, wines have been known by names reflecting their origin, and sometimes style: Bordeaux, Port, Rioja, Mosel and Chianti are all legally defined names reflecting the traditional wines produced in the named region. These naming conventions or \\"appellations\\" (as they are known in France) dictate not only where the grapes in a wine were grown but also which grapes went into the wine and how they were vinified. The appellation system is strongest in the European Union, but a related system, the American Viticultural Area, restricts the use of certain regional labels in America, such as Napa Valley, Santa Barbara and Willamette Valley. The AVA designations do not restrict the type of grape used.Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) ¬ß4.25 In most of the world, wine labeled Champagne must be made from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France and fermented using a certain method, based on the international trademark agreements included in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. However, in the United States, a legal definition called semi-generic has enabled U.S. winemakers to use certain generic terms (Champagne, Hock, Sherry, etc.) if there appears next to the term the actual appellation of origin.Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) ¬ß4.24 More recently, wine regions in countries with less stringent location protection laws such as the United States and Australia have joined with well-known European wine producing regions to sign the Napa Declaration to Protect Wine Place and Origin, commonly known as the Napa Declaration on Place. This is a \\"declaration of joint principles stating the importance of location to wine and the need to protect place names\\". Napa Declaration to Protect Wine Place and Origin (press release, Napa Valley Vintners) The Declaration was signed in July 2005 by four United States winegrowing regions and three European Union winegrowing regions. The signatory regions from the US were Napa Valley, Washington, Oregon and Walla Walla, while the signatory regions from the EU were: Champagne, Cognac (the commune where Cognac is produced), Douro (the region where Port wine is produced) and Jerez (the region where Sherry is produced). The list of signatories to the agreement expanded in March 2007 when Sonoma County, Paso Robles, Chianti Classico, Tokay, Victoria, Australia and Western Australia signed the Declaration at a ceremony in Washington, DC. =Regional wine classifications= Many regional wine classifications exist as part of tradition or appellation law. The most common of these is based on vineyard sites and include the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, though some regions classify their wines based on the style like the German wine classification system. Vineyard classification has a long history dating from some early examples in Juran√ßon in the 14th century, in 1644 when the council of W√ºrzburg ranked the city's vineyards by quality, and the early five-level designation of vineyards based on quality in Tokaj-Hegyalja in 1700.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition, p. 175 Oxford University Press 2006 , classification Other well known classifications include: * Classification of Saint-√âmilion wine of Bordeaux * Classification of Grapes wine of Bordeaux * Cru Bourgeois of Bordeaux (M√©doc) * Classified estates of Provence The follow regions are classified by vineyards, not estate. * Grand cru of Burgundy and Alsace  By vinification methods and style  Dark purple wine grapes on the vine Wines may be classified by vinification methods. These include classifications such as red or white wine, sparkling, semi-sparkling or still, fortified and dessert wines. The color of wine is not determined by the juice of the grape, which is almost always clear, but rather by the presence or absence of the grape skin during fermentation. Grapes with colored juice, for example alicante bouschet, are known as teinturier. Red wine is made from red (or black) grapes, but its red color is bestowed by a process called maceration, whereby the skin is left in contact with the juice during fermentation. White wine can be made from any colour of grape as the skin is separated from the juice during fermentation. A white wine made from a very dark grape may appear pink or 'blush'. A form of Ros√© is called Blanc de Noirs where the juice of red grapes are allowed contact with the skins for a very short time (usually only a couple of hours). = Sparkling and still wines = Sparkling wines such as champagne, contain carbon dioxide which is produced naturally from fermentation or force-injected later. To have this effect, the wine is fermented twice, once in an open container to allow the carbon dioxide to escape into the air, and a second time in a sealed container, where the gas is caught and remains in the wine.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 170 Workman Publishing 2001 Sparkling wines that gain their carbonation from the traditional method of bottle fermentation are labelled \\"Bottle Fermented\\", \\"M√©thode Traditionelle\\", or \\"M√©thode Champenoise\\". The latter designation was outlawed for all wines other than Champagne (which for obvious reasons does not bother to utilize it) in Europe in 1994.winepros.com.au. Other international denominations of sparkling wine include Sekt or Schaumwein (Germany), Cava (Spain), Spumante (Italy) and Espumante (Portugal). Semi-sparkling wines are sparkling wines that contain less than 2.5 atmospheres of carbon dioxide at sea level and 20 ¬∞C. Some countries such as the UK impose a higher tax on fully sparkling wines. Examples of semi-sparkling synonym terms are Frizzante in Italy, Vino de Aguja in Spain and Petillant in France. In most countries except the United States, champagne is legally defined as sparkling wine originating from a region (Champagne, Towns \\"Reims, √âpernay\\") in France. Still wines are wines that have not gone through the sparkling wine methods and have no effervescence. = Dessert and fortified wine = Dessert wines range from slightly sweet (with less than 50 g/L of sugar) to incredibly sweet wines (with over 400 g/L of sugar). Late harvest wines such as Sp√§tlese are made from grapes harvested well after they have reached maximum ripeness. Dried grape wines, such as Recioto and Vin Santo from Italy, are made from grapes that have been partially raisined after harvesting. Botrytized wines are made from grapes infected by the mold Botrytis cinerea or noble rot. These include Sauternes from Bordeaux, numerous wines from Loire such as Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume, Tokaji Asz√∫ from Hungary, and Beerenauslese. Ice Wine is made from grapes that are harvested while they are frozen. Fortified wines are often sweeter, and generally more alcoholic wines that have had their fermentation process stopped by the addition of a spirit, such as brandy, or have had additional spirit added after fermentation.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 488 Workman Publishing 2001 Examples include Port, Madeira and Sherry. = Other styles = Table wines are inexpensive wines that often do not specify the grape variety used or the region of origin. They are alternatively called \\"vins de table\\" (in French), \\"vino da tavola\\" (in Italian), \\"Tafelwein\\" (in German) or \\"vino de mesa\\" (in Spanish), which translate to \\"table wine\\" in English. Cooking wine or cooking sherry usually refers to inexpensive grape wine (or rice wine in Chinese and other East Asian cuisine) which is intended for use as an ingredient in food rather than as a beverage. Cooking wine typically available in North America is treated with salt to allow its sale in non-licensed grocery stores.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/24.215 This also acts as a preservative, as the salt in cooking wine inhibits the growth of the microorganisms that produce acetic acid. This will preserve a bottle of cooking wine, which may be opened and used occasionally over a long period of time. In other countries sherry wine is used for cooking.Cooking With Sherry. By Lalo Grosso, edited by Diputaci√≥n de C√°diz in 2002. Fortified wines resist spoilage, as their alcohol content is too high to permit bacterial growth. By vintage or variety A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or mostly, grown in a single specified year, and are accordingly dated as such. Consequently, it is not uncommon for wine enthusiasts and traders to save bottles of an especially good vintage wine for future consumption. However, there is some disagreement and research about the significance of vintage year to wine quality.Roman L. Weil, Parker v. Prial: The Death of the Vintage Chart Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the labeled vintage. A varietal wine is wine made from a dominant grape such as a Chardonnay or a Cabernet Sauvignon and labeled by the name of the grape variety. The wine may not be entirely of that one grape and varietal labeling laws differ. In the United States a wine needs to be composed of at least 75% of a particular grape to be labeled as a varietal wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 727 Oxford University Press 2006 In the European Union, a minimum of 85% is required if the name of a single variety is displayed, and if two or more varieties are mentioned, they combined must make up 100% and they must be listed in descending order. E.g., a mixture of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Viognier must be called Chardonnay-Viognier rather than Viognier-Chardonnay.

Conflicts with other Zapatista chiefs On several occasions Neri and his men would come into confrontation with other Zapatistas, notably with the troops of Genovevo de la O, and at one time almost with Zapata himself. In November 1913 Neri had appropriated some guns from the other Zapatista commanders which earned him a rebuke from Zapata. Neri answered with a bold letter in which he refused to return the guns, accused Zapata of favoritism and not giving him enough credit, and threatened that if Zapata tried to collect the guns again, he would break off and fight Huerta on his own. He was killed in January 1914, while returning from a campaign in Tepoztlan, by the Zapatista forces of Antonio Barona Rojas. According to some authors, there is strong circumstantial evidence that the killing was done on the orders of Zapata himself, although an explicit order to that effect has not been found.

During their stay in Japan, the band was inspired and \\"touched by the delicate snowfall imagery of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952), absorbing the vibrancy of Tokyo's Roppongi district, and spiritualised by the ancient Shinto shrines and tranquil shores of Lake Ashi.\\"\\"Hai! - press release\\".

History In April 2002, Budgie was touring the U.S. with the Banshees, and while in Chicago, met Japanese producer Hoppy Kamiyama, known for his work with Leonard Eto, previously of the Kodo Drummers. Budgie and Siouxsie had long wanted to collaborate with Eto, but had never contacted him. After an exchange of emails with Eto, the Creatures booked a studio in Tokyo and invited him to join them for a session on 19 August 2002. They approached the session in the same way as they conceived Feast: \\"Turn up and see what happens!\\".\\"H√°i! - liner notes\\". Sioux Records. 2003 \\"The Creatures are primal: it's our guts, our deepest instincts coming through\\" commented Budgie. During the recording, Siouxsie took notes and stockpiled ideas for the songs. In the days that followed the session, the duo visited Roppongi district, the Shinto shrines and Lake Ashi, and shot images with a DV camera (that footage would later appear in a documentary included as a DVD in a limited edition of H√°i!). The results of the Tokyo session with Budgie and Eto on drums and percussion became the backbone of H√°i!. In France, 11 tracks were edited from the initial 90-minute tape. Siouxsie and Budgie then developed the songs over a period of several months. During this time, Budgie learned sound engineering and recorded the album. Siouxsie approached H√°i! like a vinyl release, with an A-side and a B-side; noting that this method was \\"so we could have an extroverted side and an introverted and calmer one\\". In August 2003, they announced the release of H√°i! for October, preceded by the single \\"Godzilla!\\". Release and alternative versions The single \\"Godzilla!\\", released one week before H√°i!, included a B-side not present on the album, \\"Attack of the Supervixens\\", inspired by Russ Meyer's film Supervixens. The album was released on both double-LP and CD. Initially, two extended CD versions were also issued, one including a bonus DVD containing video footage shot by Budgie and Siouxsie in Japan plus the video of \\"2nd Floor\\", and another with a CD bonus featuring the instrumental version of the album. A third edition called H√°i! (Nama), containing the unedited drum sessions recorded in Tokyo for H√°i!, was later issued in July 2004 via the band's website. H√°i! (N√°ma) included 11 instrumentals, featuring Hoppy Kamiyama on \\"tape (Kaoss Pad)\\". The standard CD of H√°i! was also re-released in 2004 with two bonus tracks: \\"The Temple of Dawn\\" and \\"Attack of the Supervixens\\" (originally the B-sides of the \\"Godzilla!\\" CD single).

The novel tells the story of environmental activist Paul Bannerman and his family. Paul is diagnosed with thyroid cancer and, after surgery and subsequent radiation treatment, has to live quarantined at his parents' place for some time. This significant change in his life also affects his family. The novel received mixed reviews by critics, and departs from other novels by Gordimer as it does not directly deal with Apartheid, instead focusing on the struggle of a single individual. Plot After Paul Bannerman, an ecologist, is diagnosed with thyroid cancer and receives an operation, he is left radioactive. As a consequence of his radioactivity, Bannerman is left in the care of his parents so as to avoid affecting anyone else. While he is isolated, he becomes unhappy with his wife, who is a marketing executive, as he sees her as lacking convictions and enabling those he opposes as an environmentalist. Reception Critics noted that the grammar in the book was strange, and that the novel seemed at times to not have been edited. Sophie Harrison, writing for the New York Times, compared the novel favorably to The Magic Mountain, but noted differences between the respective protagonists of both novels. Harrison also criticized Gordimer's failure to focus on the particular details of Bannerman's struggle due to her attempt to provide a universally applicable narrative about illness. Gordimer was also faulted for failing to adequately flesh out the personalities of the novel's characters.

Longmans) The North Face is a 1948 heterosexual romance novel by Mary Renault, who later became famous for historical novels set in ancient Greece and featuring homosexual love between male characters. The protagonists are Neil Langton and Ellen Shorland, both of whom have tragic pasts and both of whom are staying at a boarding house in Cornwall. They both have a passion for mountain climbing, which is what first brings them together. Neil is in the process of obtaining a divorce from an adulterous wife, whilst mourning the death of his young daughter, and Ellen is mourning the loss of her first love Jock, who died in World War II, believing herself incapable of loving again.

The WACR began operating in 1980 over the old Montpelier and Barre Railroad in Washington County, which the state acquired to ensure the continuance of rail service, and ceased operations in early 1999. Later that year, after interim service by other companies, operations were transferred to a new WACR subsidiary of the Vermont Rail System. In 2003, operations were greatly expanded through acquisition by the state and operation by the WACR of a former Boston and Maine Corporation and Canadian Pacific Railway line between Newport and White River Junction, which had most recently been operated by subsidiaries of the bankrupt Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. The original line, now known as the Granite District, connects the New England Central Railroad (NECR) with Montpelier, Barre, Websterville, and Graniteville. Its primary commodities have been lumber, granite, and silicon carbide since the Bombardier transit car plant in Barre was closed in 2002. The Connecticut River Division includes haulage rights from White River Junction south to Bellows Falls on the NECR, where it connects to the affiliated Green Mountain Railroad. It also has direct connections to the former Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway at Newport and Pan Am Railways at White River Junction. History =Granite District= The majority of the Granite District was part of the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) system until 1926, when the Barre and Chelsea Railroad (Barre to Graniteville) and Montpelier and Wells River Railroad (Barre and Montpelier to Wells River) were sold to local interests.Mundy's Earning Power of Railroads, 1929, p. 195 The latter was consolidated into the former in January 1945, but in 1957 the entire Barre and Chelsea Railroad was abandoned. The Montpelier and Barre Railroad took over operations of the Montpelier and Barre-area trackage, but the line east to Wells River was abandoned. In 1980 that company abandoned its trackage, and the state bought it in November and designated the new CSF Acquisition, Inc. subsidiary Washington County Railroad to operate it.Edward A. Lewis, American Shortline Railway Guide, 5th Edition, Kalmbach Publishing, 1996, p. 328 The WACR assigned its lease to the New England Central Railroad in February 1999, but that company ceased operating the lines in September, and the Vermont Railway took over temporarily until its new affiliate began under the Washington County Railroad name.STB Finance Docket No. 33807, November 3, 1999 In early May 2010, after having been mostly dormant for some time, an official from the Barre government said that a contract for shipments of scrap granite bound for Florida would begin late the same month. Ten-car trains were planned to operate twice a day between Berlin and Montpelier Junction, as well as separate five-car trains from the granite quarries and Barre. The trains were to operate for the three months it would take for the 54,000 tons of granite the contract requested to be moved south. Further traffic of scrap granite was also considered possible, as further contracts for the material, of which 40 million tons was accessible, were being sought, and industries along the line had expressed interest in having rail service if the line was upgraded for granite shipments. =Connecticut River Division= The Connecticut River Division was built by the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, a predecessor of the B&M; which completed its line from White River Junction to Newport in October 1863 and to the Canada‚ÄìUS border in May 1867.Interstate Commerce Commission, 30 Val.

The film is considered a masterpiece of the 1950s French cinema. Andrew Sarris called it \\"the most perfect film ever made\\". Oph√ºls said the story's construction attracted him, stating \\"there is always the same axis around which the action continually turns like a carousel. A tiny, scarcely visible axis: a pair of earrings\\". The film's different titles reflect on the fact that the surname of the Madame in question - the same as that of her husband's - is never heard nor seen onscreen. The few times in the film when it might be revealed, it is elided by noise or a camera trick. Plot summary Louise (Danielle Darrieux) is an aristocratic woman of Belle √âpoque Paris, married to Andr√© (Charles Boyer), both a count and a high-ranking French army general. Louise is a beautiful, but spoiled and superficial woman who has amassed debts due to her lifestyle. She arranges to secretly sell her costly heart-shaped diamond earrings, a wedding present from her husband, to the original jeweler, Mr R√©my (Jean Debucourt). Relations between Louise and Andr√© are companionable, but they sleep in separate beds, have no children, and Andr√© has a secret mistress, of whom he has recently tired. Louise disguises the disappearance of the earrings by pretending to have lost them at the opera. The search for them eventually reaches the newspapers (\\"Theft at the Theatre\\") which in turn prompts R√©my to go to Andr√© and \\"discreetly\\" offer to sell them back. He accepts cheerfully and, rather than confront his wife, coolly gifts the earrings to his mistress, Lola (Lia Di Leo), whom he happens to be seeing off permanently to Constantinople. At her destination, however, Lola soon sells the earrings herself to settle gambling debts and they are later purchased by an Italian baron, Fabrizio Donati (Vittorio De Sica), who is on his way to a high diplomatic post in Paris. Through a series of encounters, Donati becomes infatuated with Louise, later dancing with her long into the night at a ball. Andr√©'s long absence \\"on maneuvers\\" facilitates the couple's affair. With each passage of time, the baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. Andr√©'s return prompts Louise to stop seeing Donati, but during a hunting excursion where all three are present, she witnesses Donati fall from his horse and faints. She is said to have a \\"weak heart,\\" but Andr√© sees this behavior as an affectation, and the event makes him suspicious. Louise becomes disconsolate and announces that she will take a long holiday in the Italian Lake region, alarming both her husband and her lover. Donati brings gifts: roses with the very earrings she had sold earlier. What she had cast aside so easily before suddenly has meaning to her. On her own in Italy, Louise tries to forget Donati who regales her with letters, to which she writes responses, all of which she promptly destroys. She meets with him secretly again and confesses that she's able to console herself only through possession of the earrings, which she now identifies with her lover, not her marriage. Upon her return to Paris, Louise resolves to continue with the affair. To explain the reappearance of the earrings, she now creates an elaborate ruse that they had been misplaced in one of her gloves the entire time, making a big show of \\"finding\\" them in front of Andr√©. He knows she is lying but says nothing. At yet another formal ball, Andr√© takes the earrings from Louise, quietly takes Donati aside, and confronts him about them, revealing their true history. He then gives them to Donati instructing him to sell them back to the jeweler, so that he may buy them back a third time to give yet again to Louise. Before departing, Donati informs Louise he can no longer see her and expresses his pain at learning of her lies. Louise falls into a deep depression. Andr√© presents her with the earrings he has bought back and informs her that her unhappiness is her own fault and that she must give the earrings away to his niece who has just given birth. Louise tearfully agrees. The niece is soon forced to sell the earrings yet again to R√©my to pay off her own husband's debts, and R√©my offers to sell them back to Andr√© for a fourth time, but he now angrily refuses. Louise goes to the jeweler herself and buys the earrings back with money from sales of her other jewelry and furs. She informs Andr√© of what she has done. In his anguish at having lost her love ‚Äì or perhaps never having had it ‚Äì Andr√© goes to the gentleman's club where he confronts Donati on the pretext of a slight and challenges him to a duel with pistols. Louise pleads with Donati not to go through with the duel; Andr√© has been seen to be an excellent shot and will surely kill him. Donati is pensive, but refuses to withdraw and arrives at the dueling field with his and Andr√©'s seconds. Meanwhile, Louise goes to the Church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont to pray fervently at the shrine of St. Genevi√®ve that Donati be spared ‚Äì the same place where she was seen earlier praying frivolously that the jeweler will be willing to buy back her earrings. She then races with her servant to the duel just as the agents inform the duelists that the \\"offended party,\\" Andr√©, is allowed to fire first. He takes aim at Donati, who stands unflinching. As Louise hastens up the hill toward the duel, a single shot is heard, but no second shot, implying that one duelist may be dead. She slumps against a tree as the servant runs for help. Ultimately it is seen that Louise has left a burning candle at the shrine, along with her prized earrings, and a card reading that they are a gift from her.

With each implied passage of time, the Baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. This sequence, with its glittering costumes and furnishings, and swirling camera work, is a celebrated example of Oph√ºls' technique. In Oph√ºls' original treatment for the film, every scene was to be shot through mirrors on walls and other locations. His producers rejected the idea. After his experience of shooting La Ronde, Oph√ºls was determined to stay on budget and on schedule for this film and made extensive preparations during pre-production. He ended up finishing the film ahead of schedule and under budget. He worked closely with art director Georges Annenkov to create the right atmosphere for the film, and had Annenkov design prop earrings that were appropriate. The prop earrings were on display at the Franco-London-Film production studios for many years. The film's script became considerably different from de Vilmorin's short novel, and Oph√ºls stated that \\"besides the earrings, there's very little of the novel left in the film...[just] the senselessness of that woman's life.\\" Oph√ºls spoke privately with Danielle Darrieux between takes throughout the shooting and told her to portray the emptiness of her character. At first Oph√ºls was too embarrassed to give direction to Vittorio De Sica out of respect for De Sica's work as a director, but the two became friends during the film's production. Darrieux, Charles Boyer and Annenkov had all worked together in 1936 on the film Mayerling, which was Darrieux's first leading role. Reception The film received mixed reviews when first released, but its reputation has grown over the years. In a 1961 article in Kulchur and later reprinted in her first book, Pauline Kael praised the movie‚Äôs performances and its ‚Äúsensuous camerawork,‚Äù ‚Äúextraordinary romantic atmosphere,‚Äù and ‚Äúpolished, epigrammatic dialogue.‚ÄùKael, Pauline (1965). I Lost It at the Movies. Boston: Little, Brown and Co. The film was revived in England in 1979, where it was rediscovered as a masterpiece. Derek Malcolm called it \\"a supreme piece of film-making which hardly puts a foot wrong for 2 hours...a magnificent and utterly timeless dissection of passion and affection, the game of life and love itself.\\" Lindsay Anderson criticized the film, stating \\"the camera is never still; every shot has the tension of a conjuring trick. The sleight of hand is dazzling, but fatally distracting...With a supple, ingenious, glittering flow of images that is aesthetically the diametric opposite of Mme. de Vilmorin's chaste prose, he has made the film an excuse for a succession of rich, decorative displays...In all this visual frou-frou it is not surprising that the characters become lost and the interior development of the drama is almost completely unobserved.\\" Fran√ßois Truffaut wrote that the film was very similar to Oph√ºls' earlier film Liebelei, stating that \\"the last half hour, the duel and the finale, is a remake pure and simple.\\" Jacques Rivette praised the film, calling it \\"a difficult work, in the fullest sense of the word, even in its writing, one in which everything aims to disconcert, distract the viewer from what is essential through the accumulation of secondary actions, wrong turns, repetitions and delays; a work in which the picturesque tries hard to conceal the pathetic.\\" Molly Haskell has called the film a masterpiece with a cult following that grows every year. Haskell has asserted that the film is usually not as revered as other, more male-oriented films because it is a female-oriented film. Richard Roud has stated that Oph√ºls made film about \\"women. More specifically, women in love. Most often, women who are unhappily in love, or whom love brings misfortune of one kind or another.\\" The Earrings of Madame De... holds an approval rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 8.73/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Oph√ºls' graceful camerawork and visual portrayal of luxury and loss make Earrings a powerful French drama.\\" Awards In 1954, Georges Annenkov and Rosine Delamare were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.

In 2001, the population was 11. Over a period of about 24 hours on March 7, 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that coincided with the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Reverie. This places Reverie on the Arkansas side, while most of the area of Tipton County is located east of the Mississippi River, the Tennessee side. The formation of the new Centennial Cut-off, named for the US centennial, and the abandonment of the stretch of river formerly known as the Devil's Elbow, led to a 1918 Supreme Court case (Arkansas v. Tennessee) on whether the border should be moved with the river.http://supreme.justia.com/us/246/158/case.html In 1900, a mastodon skeleton was discovered east of Reverie. In the first half of the 20th century, archeological artifacts from an aboriginal village dated AD 1400-1650 were found about northeast of Reverie, at the Nodena Site.http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/hampsonmuseum/ ArkansasStateParks.com, Hampson Museum Demographics According to the United States Census, in 2000 the total population of the Reverie voting precinct was 11.

After the abolition of slavery, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers. As a result of the lessened need for agricultural laborers, and very little potential for other forms of employment, the population of the area has dropped precipitously in recent decades. In 2007, there were no industries in Reverie. History Founded in the 1800s, Reverie is one of the early settlements in Tipton County. In 1883, a U.S. Post office was opened that in 2007 is no longer in existence.http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/history/places/postoff4.htm Tennessee State Library and Archives =Prehistoric mastodon skeleton= Mastodon skeleton Mastodons are members of the prehistoric, extinct genus Mammut, they resemble modern elephants.

Early life Born into Austrian nobility, the family shortened its name when the nobility was abolished in Austria in 1918. He studied at the Vienna Technical University until in 1927, where he earned an engineering master's degree. Later that year he joined the Institute for Automotive Engineering at Dresden Technical University as a research assistant and Ph.D. candidate. In 1933 Ferdinand Porsche persuaded him to join Auto Union. Auto Union Eberan-Eberhorst initially served as a development engineer within the Auto Union racing department at Horch works in Zwickau, moving to head up the racing engine department. The Racing Car - Development and Design. Clutton, Posthumus and Jenkinson He was responsible for turning Chief Engineer Porsche's ideas in physical reality, and his early contributions to Auto Union's successes included development of side skirts and aerodynamic bodywork along the belly of the record breaking streamliner car, additions that were some of the earliest experiments with ground effect downforce to have been applied to a car. =Type D= When Porsche left Auto Union in 1938 Eberan-Eberhorst was promoted in his stead.

Chassis modifications were made aimed at improving the drivability of the car by mass distribution (revised driver and fuel tank position), and a new de Dion rear suspension replacing the previous swing axle system. The Racing Car - Development and Design. Clutton, Posthumus and Jenkinson. The car provided Grand Prix victories for Tazio Nuvolari and Hermann Paul M√ºller. Eberan- Eberhorst was heavily involved in the initial testing of each new racing car, developing an on-board recording instrument to plot parameters such as car speed, engine speed, gear change and braking points. World War II He gained his doctorate in 1940 and from 1941 was appointed to a full professorship at Dresden Technical University. During World War II he was involved in the design of the Tiger tank, initial testing of the V1/V2 rockets, and provided much research data on improving fuel consumption. After World War II At the conclusion of World War II Eberan-Eberhorst fled Dresden, in the Soviet occupied sector of defeated Germany. In 1947, in an old sawmill in Gm√ºnd, Austria, Ferdinand Porsche‚Äôs son Ferry and Eberan-Eberhorst started work on project 356, which evolved into the famous Porsche 356 sports car. Later, the Italian Piero Dusio decided to build racing cars at his Cisitalia works in Turin, bringing in the engineers Dante Giacosa and Giovanni Savonuzzi from Fiat and Piero Taruffi to manage the racing team. When the team decided to enter Grand Prix competition, Carlo Abarth and Robert Eberan- Eberhorst were also recruited. This project went sour when the designers proposed a flat 12 four-cam engine with the possibility of supercharging and even four-wheel drive plus Eberhorst‚Äôs usual requirements for proper jigs, test-beds and tooling; his view was that races are better lost on the test- beds then they can be won on the tracks. Eberhorst was by now recognised as one of the world's premier racing car design theorists, so in 1949 he moved to Dunstable, where he worked for ERA designing the chassis for the 1952 Bristol engined 'G' type grand prix car Wikepedia - English Racing Automobiles, and on the Jowett Jupiter chassis. Wikepedia - Jowett Cars In 1950, he moved to Aston Martin to design a pure sports-racing car, the DB3, his brief being to produce a car that would be quick enough to give the 2.6-litre straight six a chance of outright wins. Whilst at Aston Martin Eberhorst published an article in the Automobile Engineer entitled ‚ÄúRoll Angles‚Äù. This theoretical study followed Maurice Olley‚Äôs paper ‚ÄúRoad Manners of the Modern Car‚Äù and established ex- Rolls-Royce engineer Olley and Eberhorst as two of only a handful of engineers capable of mathematically defining the essential factors in car handling. Eberhorst‚Äôs contribution was to show how the several constants in Olley‚Äôs complex equations could be established experimentally. In 1953 Eberhorst returned to Germany as General Manager for Technical Development at a reviving Auto Union. In 1956 he moved to the Battelle Institute in Frankfurt as Head of Mechanical Engineering and four years later he took over responsibility for the Combustion Engines and Automotive Engineering Institute at Vienna University. He retired from there in 1965 although continuing to author important technical papers.

And Fia was born in 2004 23rd of April  History  Following the Peace of Paris in (1763) the newly appointed governor of the southern British Caribbean islands, Robert Melville, and the military surgeon in St. Vincent, George Young, decided to create a botanic garden, primarily to provide medicinal plants for the military and improve the life and economy of the colony. In the early 18th century great emphasis had been laid on introducing valuable and commercial plants from the East Indies to Kew Gardens in England to be sent later to the American tropics. The Royal Society fostered the introduction, establishment, and dissemination of highly prized species. Melville, anticipating modern ethnobotany, urged that \\"physical practitioners of the country, natives of experience, and even old Caribs and slaves who have dealt in cures might be worth taking notice of, and if at any time you should think that a secret may be got at or even an improvement for small expense, I shall readily pay for it.\\" The War Department (UK) and the Honourable East India Company sent seeds and plants from tropical India and from British North Borneo, Sabah, and Sarawak in the East Indies. Other species came from French and Caribbean sources, such as cinnamon from Guadeloupe and Grenada. From Kew Gardens came seeds from China. Richard A. Howard, \\"The St. Vincent Botanic Garden -- The Early Years\\", Arnoldia, Harvard University. Under the capable and enthusiastic guidance of Young and several successive curators, both British and French, the Botanical Gardens quickly attained an enviable reputation and received wide acclaim. It was a great time for the exchange of valuable plants in the Caribbean, from French Guiana to Jamaica. William Bligh, by Alexander Huey, 1814. Among the wide variety of tropical trees and shrubs is a third generation breadfruit tree, a sucker from the original plant brought by Captain William Bligh (of Bounty fame) in 1793. In 1787-88 Captain Bligh made his ill-fated voyage on the Bounty to Tahiti to collect breadfruit and other useful plants for the West Indies.William Bligh, A Voyage to the South Sea For The Purpose Of Conveying The Bread-Fruit Tree To The West Indies, Including An Account Of The Mutiny On Board The Ship, Project Gutenberg, No. 15411. Undaunted by the notorious mutiny of his first crew, Bligh again set sail for Tahiti aboard . He completed his mission in Kingstown, St. Vincent on January 23, 1793 with plants from the South Seas. The Botanic Garden's Curator took great care of these plants, and the success of all those efforts is evident from the widespread distribution of breadfruit, the most useful food plant throughout the West Indies. The first half of the 19th Century was a lean time for colonial botanic gardens. By 1850, due to a lack of interest and maintenance, the St. Vincent gardens had fallen into disrepair. Local efforts in St. Vincent initiated in 1884 began to revive the gardens; by 1890 the work was reactivated as part of a larger agricultural and botanical scheme. The Botanical Gardens soon regained their former glory and beauty, and the plant collections were recovered. Considerable attention was given to experimental work in the gardens on economic crops until 1944 (cotton, arrowroot, cacao and sugarcane). The layout of the re-established Gardens was improved by the construction of a small Doric Temple, by road building and by the continuous introduction of plants to maintain and add to the collection.

She contributed many of the background paintings for John James Audubon's The Birds of America (1831‚Äì39) and Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (1845‚Äì48). Bachman was the only woman of the three principal assistants that Audubon employed at the time. Early life Maria Martin Bachman was born July 6, 1796 in Charleston, South Carolina just two and half weeks after the ‚ÄúGreat Fire of 1796‚Äù that destroyed many of the buildings and houses in the center of the city. Martin was the youngest of the four surviving children (Eliza, Harriet, and Jane) born to Jacob and Rebecca Martin, well-to-do mantua makers that owned two houses with household slaves. Raised in a Lutheran household, Maria Martin and her sisters were raised to be ‚ÄúGod fearing, responsible adults‚Äù and trained ‚Äúin the liberal arts and honourable manners‚Äù. Martin‚Äôs mother Rebecca Martin had learned from her second marriage that her husband could easily take legal ownership of her property and finances. To avoid losing her property to a future husband, Rebecca had a ‚ÄúMarriage Settlement‚Äù drawn before marrying Jacob Martin, her third husband. When Martin was 17 years old her father Jacob left the family to relocate to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with his mistress. Her mother‚Äôs foresight allowed Rebecca to retain ownership of her houses and four slaves when her husband left.  Career  Illustration of Coluber elapsoides by Maria Martin as published in North American herpetology Martin accompanied her brother-in-law, John Bachman, on several field excursions, including one trip to Niagara Falls, and learned how to make scientific descriptions and drawings of plants and animals. In the 1830s Audubon was a guest at the Bachman household during a trip to study bird species in the South. During his stay, Audubon encouraged Martin in her drawing and tutored her in natural illustration. After realizing Martin's artistic talent, Audubon supplied her with paint brushes and other art materials, and advice on how to use them to develop her talents. He spoke highly of her work in letters to John Bachman, stating in one letter \\"Miss Martin, with her superior talents, assists us greatly in the way of drawing; the insects she has drawn are, perhaps, the best I've seen.\\" Audubon went on to ask Martin to assist with paintings for his definitive book The Birds of America. Over the course of five years, Martin assisted on volumes 2 and 4 the book. She was not paid for this work. Audubon credited Martin with nine illustrations, but it is thought that she contributed to at least 30. Martin also provided illustrations to John Edwards Holbrook for publication in his work North American Herpetology. Martin also assisted John Bachman in editing The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, a collaboration between Bachman and Audubon, and later Audubon's son John Woodhouse Audubon. The importance of her contribution to Quadrupeds is discussed in a letter from John Bachman to John J. Audubon, saying Martin \\"knocks to the right and left with your articles and mine--lops off, corrects, criticizes, abuses and praises by turn\\" and \\"she does wonders\\". John J. Audubon named a variety of the hairy woodpecker (Picus martinae) Maria's Woodpecker, in Martin's honor.  Personal life  In 1845, Martin moved into Reverend John and Harriet Bachman‚Äôs house to help her sister Harriet raise her nine surviving children. Harriet was weakened emotionally and physically from consumption and the 14 pregnancies she brought to term between 1816 and 1832. Martin was placed in charge of overseeing the religious and moral education of her nieces and nephews. Martin dedicated her life to the Bachman family ensuring the household maintained order while her sister remained bedridden and dying from consumption. Two years after Martin joined the Bachman family, Harriet died and left Martin the de facto matriarch of the household. Within two years of living as aunt to the children and sister-in-law to Reverend Bachman, Martin drafted her own marriage settlement and married her brother-in-law Reverend John Bachman whom she remained dedicated wife and business partner throughout her life. She left Charleston for Columbia, South Carolina in 1861 due to the Civil War, and remained there until her death in 1863.  Exhibitions  = New-York Historical Society Museum & Library = Audubon‚Äôs Aviary: The Complete Flock is an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society featuring all 435 of Audubon's Birds of America prints. The website released an article titled \\"Meet Audubon‚Äôs Assistant Painter: Maria Martin Bachman\\", acknowledging Maria Martin's contributions to the work. The article states that Audubon acknowledged Martin's contributions to nine of the Birds of America prints, but it is thought she collaborated on over 30 of the prints. = The Charleston Museum = Martin is highlighted in the Charleston Museum's exhibition Preserving Nature's Beauty: The Art of Herbaria.

The ship was built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi as hull number 1030 and delivered on 10 October 1958. The ship was scrapped in Chittagong, Bangladesh on 16 April 2004. From delivery in 1958 until 1976, the ship was operated by Eagle Carriers. In 1976, she was bought by Keystone Shipping Company and renamed Fredericksburg. She continued to operate as a coastal tanker until 2004. Fredericksburg was for some time the oldest tanker in the U.S. fleet, and its age showed. She was subject to a number of refittings and retrofittings, such as the 1983 forecastle overhaul. Also, towards the end of her career, she had a number of safety problems. For example, on 10 June 1999 when loaded, after experiencing a steering failure, she \\"grounded under power at mile forty-three in the Columbia River.\\" Fortunately, she \\"came ashore in an area of the river characterized by soft mud banks and suffered no damage.\\" Some of Fredericksburgs problems were detailed in this 1 January 2003 article \\"Puget Sound's Rustbuckets:\\" Finally, although \\"its OPA90 phase-out date is 8-Dec-05, Keystone Tankships will scrap the tanker Fredericksburg rather than incur the cost of its next dry-docking survey, which is due this month (2/6).\\" In 2004, she was filled with grain in the port of Houston and sailed to Chittagong, Bangladesh where she was driven onto the beach and scrapped. The selling price was reportedly $425 per light displacement ton or 3.7 million U.S. dollars. Fredericksburg was joined by her sister ship Chilbar at the scrapyard later that year.

Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving a lawsuit against a sheriff's deputy brought by a motorist who was paralyzed after the officer ran his eluding vehicle off the road during a high-speed car chase. The driver contended that this action was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The case also involved the question of whether a police officer's qualified immunity shielded him from suit under Section 1983. On April 30, 2007, in an 8-1 decision, the court sided with police and ruled that a \\"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\\" In a rare occurrence, the court accepted the presentation of video evidence of the high-speed pursuit. Such procedure is quite uncommon in the Supreme Court and was viewed as part of an interesting relationship between the Supreme Court and technology. The video had a strong effect on the Court's decision and is viewed as a major factor in how the court made its decision. The author of the opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, in a first-time occurrence ever, posted the video of the car chase online (for access to the video, see external links below). Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, argued that the videotape evidence was not decisive, as the majority claimed it to be, and that a jury should determine if deadly force was justified. He stated a jury should be used, instead of the case \\"being decided by a group of elderly appellate judges,\\" a reference to himself and his colleagues on the court (this sentence is not in the text of the dissent, but he pronounced it while reading the opinion at bench).Associated Press.\\"Court Sides With Cops On High-Speed Chase, Supreme Court Rejects Arguments Of Man Paralyzed in Crash Stemming From Police Pursuit\\", CBS News, April 30, 2007.

Accessed 27 February 2007 Military career After initial service in the fleet Torrens-Spence volunteered for flying duties with the Fleet Air Arm, which at that time was under the command of the Royal Air Force. After flying training, he was commissioned as a pilot in both the RAF and the Navy. His first postings were on the carriers and, in 1937, . =Second World War= When war broke out, Torrens-Spence was serving on Glorious which was sent through the Suez Canal to hunt German surface raiders. He was then sent home from Aden to join the new carrier . Whilst serving on Illustrious, which had been dispatched to the Mediterranean in September 1940, he took part in the attack on Italian battleships in the Battle of Taranto as a Swordfish torpedo bomber pilot. During the Swordfish attack in Taranto harbour, he torpedoed one of Italy's newest and largest battleships, the , sinking her in shallow water. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for this action.Obituary 13 December 2001 The TimesFleet Air Arm Archive Taranto crewlist He was also involved when Illustrious was badly damaged; Illustrious was escorting a convoy to Malta when she was attacked by three squadrons of German Stuka dive bombers. Suffering multiple bomb hits (including to Torrens-Spence's wardroom) and more than 200 casualties, Illustrious limped to Malta and eventually to America for repairs. Her aircraft were disembarked in Malta, and Torrens-Spence flew to Eleusis, near Athens, Greece, with elements of 815 and 819 Squadrons for an active anti-shipping campaign which later earned him the Distinguished Service Order. At the Battle of Cape Matapan, Torrens-Spence was ordered to find and attack a large Italian naval force. After observing an attack by aircraft from the carrier achieve no result, he found a hole in the enemy smokescreen and was confronted with the , which he torpedoed from close range. The cruiser immediately slowed to six knots and the Italian admiral decided to divide his force, leaving a large detachment to escort Pola and sail for home. That night, the Royal Navy engaged with the Italian force off Cape Matapan, and with the aid of radar sank the major part of them. Polas captain was rescued by the destroyer and was heard to remark, \\"Either that pilot was mad or he is the bravest man in the world\\". Admiral Andrew Cunningham wrote in his dispatch after the battle: \\"An example of the spirit of these young officers is the case of Lieutenant F.M.A. Torrens-Spence who rather than be left out, flew with the only available aircraft from Eleusis to Maleme ... arranged his own reconnaissance and finally took off with a second aircraft in company and took part in the dawn attack.\\" A Fairey Swordfish similar to those used by Torrens- Spence From March to October 1941, Torrens-Spence commanded 815 Squadron in Albania, where he added to his tally. Unfortunately, this included a hospital ship which the Italians had failed to mark and illuminate. No blame was ever attached to Torrens-Spence, but he was forever saddened by the incident. From 1942, Torrens-Spence was posted to the UK to become a test pilot at Boscombe Down where he remained for the next three years, until posted back to Illustrious for the closing stages of the war.Fleet Air Arm archive 815 Squadron history =Post-war= He remained in the Navy after the war, becoming chief inspector of the Empire Test Pilots' School.

For approximately 2 years the snowcats were produced under the brand name of DMC but by 1981 or 1982 the brand name was switched to LMC. All 3 brands were based in the same factory during the ownership changes and was headquartered in Logan, Utah. Both DMC and LMC snowcats were available in numerous models and were available for use grooming ski-slopes, transporting work crews, and for snowmobile snow grooming. Many are still in commercial use today. Popular production snowcats manufactured by Thiokol were carried over almost through DMC and LMC's product lines and the IMP, Super IMP and Spryte models are still in use today and often favored by private snowcat owners for back country transportation uses. Other brands that competed with DMC and LMC included the Tucker Sno-Cat and Bombardier snowcats. DeLorean sold his shares to an investment group in 1993, by that time several snowcat brands had ceased operation due to market factors, among them the Snow Trac and Kristi.

It stars RKO's imitation Abbott and Costello, Alan Carney and Wally Brown, as a pair of men who are tasked with finding a real zombie for a zombie-themed nightclub. Sheldon Leonard, as a former mobster turned nightclub owner, and Bela Lugosi, as the mad scientist who created the zombies, also appear. Plot summary Jerry Miles (Wally Brown) and Mike Strager (Alan Carney) are employed as Broadway press agents. Their latest idea is to hire a \\"genuine zombie\\" for the opening of the Zombie Hut, a new cabaret nightclub owned by gangster Ace Miller (Sheldon Leonard) that will open on Friday the 13th of the next month. The boys plan is to dress a former boxer up as a zombie, figuring no one will know the difference. However, Ace's nemesis, a Walter Winchell type radio celebrity is friends with the boxer and vows he will publicly humiliate Ace Miller if a real zombie is not at the opening of the club. The boys are threatened with death unless they produce a real zombie. They discover a lead from a museum curator that a mysterious Professor Renault (Bela Lugosi) lives on the Caribbean island of San Sebastian and has been creating zombies. Followed by Ace's henchmen, the boys are immediately placed on a tramp steamer sailing to San Sebastian in the Virgin Islands and ordered to bring a real zombie back or forfeit their lives. Upon arrival they meet the beautiful cabaret singer Jean La Dance (Anne Jeffreys). In exchange for her help in locating Professor Renault, Jean wants passage off the island. Miles and Strager eventually meet up with the zombie expert Professor Renault. Unknown to them, the professor's zombie, Kalaga, (Darby Jones) has captured Jean and brought her to the Professor's secret laboratory, While Miles and Strager investigate the house, Jean awakes to find herself gagged and strapped to a table as the Professor's next test subject. Before he can proceed to give Jean the serum his guard dogs detect intruders. Jean is quickly spirited to a secret dungeon where she is tied up but manages to escape. Strager becomes \\"zombified\\" by being under the spell of Renault's secret formula and Miles, Jean and Strager the zombie return home where Miller's henchmen are waiting for them. Convinced that Strager is a real zombie, they bring him to the club. When Strager comes out of his trance, the boys must face the wrath of Ace Miller, a nightclub owner, who is more frightening than anything they've seen yet. Cast Production notes The Caribbean island named \\"San Sebastian\\" in this film is also the name of the island featured in two earlier RKO films from 1943: I Walked With a Zombie and The Ghost Ship with Sir Lancelot and Darby Jones repeating their roles. Zombies on Broadway turned in a profit for RKO, which encouraged the studio to re-unite Brown, Carney, Anne Jeffreys and Bela Lugosi for the film Genius at Work in 1946. Reception Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that \\"the only real entertainment value to be had in Zombies on Broadway, apart from spotting connections to I Walked With a Zombie, is derived from the scenes involving the little monkey, who clearly believes he's working on a much better film than everyone else.\\" Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"Brown and Carney aren't funny, and it's sad to see Lugosi outwitted by a pack of morons.\\"  References  External links  * 1945 films 1940s comedy horror films American films American black-and-white films American comedy horror films American zombie comedy films English-language films Films scored by Roy Webb Films directed by Gordon Douglas Films set in the Caribbean Mad scientist films 1945 comedy films ","title":"Zombies on Broadway"},{"id":"9757250","text":"The Awakening is the debut album by the Swedish death metal band Merciless.

Background  Kenneth Jernigan was born totally blind in Detroit, Michigan, but grew up on a farm in the hills of Tennessee. Beginning at the age of six, he was educated at the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville, Tennessee for his undergraduate work, and he went on to earn his Master's Degree in English from Peabody College in Nashville. He excelled at that institution both academically and in leadership development. Among other things, he was listed in \\"Who's Who\\" among colleges and universities, and received an award in 1949, the Captain Charles W. Brown Award, presented each year by the American Foundation for the Blind to America's most outstanding blind college student. As leader of the National Federation of the Blind, Jernigan would participate in major conflicts with the American Foundation for the Blind. Upon his graduation from Peabody, he taught high school English at the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville for four years, and he became acquainted with and joined the National Federation of the Blind during that time. He moved to Oakland, California in 1953 and joined the faculty of the newly established California Orientation Center for Blind Adults. In that same year (1953), he also became fully active in the \\"organized blind movement\\" and became a noted civil rights leader in earnest for the remainder of his life. In a 1954 Jernigan document, when he was challenging the California school system to hire qualified, blind teachers, there is early evidence of his passion for justice for the blind. Among other things, he wrote to the State Legislature of California: > The history of mankind is the story of the triumph of reason over > superstition, of knowledge over belief, of fact over prejudice, and the > progress of mankind is but the result of that triumph. In every area of > human endeavor, advancement has come only with the crumbling of the barriers > of ignorance. It has been so with science, with religion, with industrial > technology and with human relations, and it is still so today. The struggle > for enlightenment and justice has been and is the great issue of the age. Of > the many superstitions and misconceptions, which have barred the way to > progress, perhaps none has been more firmly entrenched or has more > stubbornly resisted the light of reason than traditional concepts about > blindness. According to anciently honorable custom, the blind have been > considered a group apart, a helpless and hopeless lot. They have been > relegated to positions of social isolation, subjected to legal > discriminations and denied that most fundamental right of all free men--the > right to work for their daily bread and to earn their self-respect. They > have been thought of not as unemployed but as unemployable. These are the > time-honored notions, the traditional concepts, but even the most > respectable of fallacies cannot withstand the truth forever. The barriers > have at last begun to crumble, and the blind to emerge from their long > subjugation. In the democratic tradition, they have organized themselves for > united action and now, instead of charity, they have begun to demand > equality--the right to work and to live as free citizens in a free society; > the right to succeed or fail according to their individual abilities. By 1956, Kenneth Jernigan had become president of a Bay Area local chapter, the Alameda Club, of the National Federation of the Blind of California. In his capacity as a local chapter president, he wrote the following to the Supreme Court of California to protest the denial of the right of a blind man to serve on a jury: > The feeling on the part of some that the blind are incompetent to perform > jury service is simply one more manifestation of the ancient stereotype > which regards blindness as helplessness. That the blind are competent to > perform jury service is evidenced by the fact that blind persons have in > many instances actually served as jurors, and several are currently serving > as judges. Could it be that a blind person is competent to be a judge and > not a juror? If so, wherein lies the distinction? Surely a judge is called > upon to weigh evidence as often as a juror, and his duties are as complex!  The Iowa Experiment  In 1958, Kenneth Jernigan left California and moved to Iowa to become director of Iowa's failed rehabilitation program for the blind. This state program, the Iowa Commission for the Blind (now called the Iowa Department for the Blind http://www.IDBonline.org), had been determined by a 1957 Federal Rehabilitation study to be the least effective rehabilitation agency for the blind in America. Kenneth Jernigan took the Iowa Commission for the Blind directorship specifically to offer a new and revolutionary training model as to how properly to assist and empower blind people. He intended to use the \\"philosophy\\" of the National Federation of the Blind as the foundation for all state services for the blind. After Jernigan had been in Iowa for only two weeks, he wrote a detailed letter to Governor Herschel Loveless outlining the deplorable conditions he had found in the agency upon his arrival. He listed countless critical needs of the agency, and then he finished his letter by saying: \\"The present director should be given a reasonable (but only a reasonable) time in which to show results. If he does not show results, he should be fired. The present director would not be willing that it should be any other way.\\" Kenneth Jernigan was not fired. In fact, ten years later, because of the unparalleled success of the new Jernigan training model at the Iowa Commission for the Blind, he was presented with a citation from President Lyndon Johnson for his outstanding work. Because of the remarkable success of this new Iowa model, the presenter of the Lyndon Johnson accolade, Harold Russell of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, was moved to remark, \\"If a person must be blind, it is better to be blind in Iowa than in any other place in the nation, or the world!\\" Leadership of the National Federation of the Blind In 1968, upon the death of the founder of the National Federation of the Blind, Jacobus tenBroek, Kenneth Jernigan became President of the organization, and remained in that position until 1986, when he decided to retire and was succeeded by Marc Maurer, who held the position until 2014. Jernigan briefly stepped down in 1977 for health reasons, but was reelected the following year. Like tenBroek before him and Maurer after him, Jernigan became known for his powerful banquet speeches, which he gave each year at the organization's national convention even after his presidency. These speeches, which are available at the NFB website, combine references to history and literature, humorous anecdotes and serious reflections about the struggles of blind people. During Jernigan's presidency, the NFB continued to expand and advocates for its beliefs about the need for more independence for blind people. He led the organization's fight against the National Accreditation Council of agencies for the blind which attempted to discredit the Federation and block agency reforms. After his presidency, Jernigan edited and contributed to over a dozen of books of stories about blind people, known as kernel books, which contain true stories about life experiences of federation members. Following Jernigan's death, Maurer continued to edit Kernel Books, of which over 30 have now been released.  The National Center for the Blind  Kenneth Jernigan relocated from Iowa to Baltimore, Maryland in 1978 and established the National Center for the Blind, the home of the National Federation of the Blind, at 1800 Johnson Street in South Baltimore. Under his dynamic leadership, this Center became the focal point of civil rights activity not only for the blind of America, but also for the world. Kenneth Jernigan continued his revolutionary work until his untimely death from lung cancer in 1998. During the course of his life, Kenneth Jernigan was presented with countless honors and awards. He also received various Honorary Doctorates from American colleges and universities. Shortly before his death, the federal Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), an agency of the United States Department of Education, honored Dr. Jernigan with its Lifetime Achievement Award. In making the presentation, RSA Commissioner Dr. Fredric K. Schroeder said: > So, what has changed? Quite simply, nothing, and everything. Certainly not > the National Federation of the Blind, No, it is not the Federation, our > vehicle for collective action, that has changed; but we ourselves. We the > blind are a different people; no longer on the outside looking in; no longer > in abject poverty; no longer without hope or belief; no longer without a > literature which defines the nuance of our understanding and belies the > nonsense of the naysayers; no longer without a corps of leaders hardened on > the picket lines and tempered in the trenches; no longer without the > possibility of training at superior centers; no longer without the right to > have our blind children be taught Braille; no longer without the material > resources of superb physical plant and cutting-edge technology; no longer > the passive recipients of yesterday's charity but the active architects of > tomorrow's promise; and no longer without the legacy of Dr. Kenneth Jernigan > and the tools he left us to finish the journey to full freedom and > integration.  Death  Kenneth Jernigan served as the elected leader of the National Federation of the Blind from 1968 until 1986, but he continued as the political leader of the organization until near the time of his death in 1998. His tombstone in Baltimore bears the following legend offered in loving memory by the blind community: \\"He taught us it is respectable to be blind!\\" He was married to Mary Ellen Jernigan, who is still active in the NFB, particularly in planning the national conventions.

The Duke of Marlborough successfully broke through the French Lines of Brabant, an arc of defensive fieldworks stretching in a seventy-mile arc from Antwerp to Namur.Chandler, Marlborough as Military Commander; p 158 Although he was unable to bring about a decisive battle, the breaking and subsequent razing of the lines would prove critical to the allied victory at Ramillies the next year. Prelude Early in the campaigning season, Marlborough attempted to launch an invasion of France up the Moselle valley. This effort was halted by a combination of supply shortages and an excellent French defensive position in front of Sierck, and Marlborough and his army were recalled by the Dutch States General when Marshall Villeroi attacked and took the fortress of Huy and threatened Liege. Having rushed back to the Low Countries (and forcing Villeroi to retreat behind his defenses), Marlborough retook Huy, and then planned to break through the lines to bring Villeroi to battle.Falkner, Great and Glorious Days; p 89 Breakthrough On the evening of 17 July Marlborough sent the Dutch troops under Marshal Overkirk in a feint southwards towards Namur, drawing Villeroi and 40,000 men after them. Overnight he marched with his own English and Scottish troops northwards to the small village of Eliksem (Elixheim), and there broke through the lines without resistance.Chandler, Marlborough as Military Commander; p 159 Early the next day, as Overkirk's men countermarched northwards to join with Marlborough, a French detachment attacked the small force of allied troops drawn up to the west of the lines, facing south. Following a short but intense cavalry battle, in which Marlborough was often personally engaged, they were driven off, and Villeroi withdrew his army to the west, behind the river Dyle.Falkner, Marlborough's Wars:Eyewitness Accounts; pp. 84‚Äì6 Aftermath Unable to pursue the French with any vigour on the day of the battle due to the exhaustion of his men, who had marched all night and then fought an intense battle, Marlborough nonetheless still hoped to bring Villeroi to battle.Falkner, Great and Glorious Days; p 92 He was frustrated in manoeuvering to the west of the lines in the month immediately following the breakthrough. A final effort in early August, using waggons loaded with supplies to remove his dependency on his lines of communication, while successful in forcing Villeroi's army to make a stand close to Waterloo, ultimately failed to bring about a battle due to the veto exercised by the Dutch Field Deputies, notably Slangenburg.Chandler, Marlborough as Military Commander; p 163 The Duke was forced to content himself with the capture of the fortress of Leau and the levelling of the Lines of Brabant between Leau and the Meuse.Falkner, Marlborough's Wars, p 90 Notes References  Elixheim Elixheim Elixheim Elixheim Elixheim Elixheim 1705 in France ","title":"Battle of Elixheim"},{"id":"9757325","text":"Bremerv√∂rde is a railway station in northwestern Germany.

Its clubhouse is located at 7 West 43rd Street near Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. It is primarily a club for men and women with distinction in literature or the arts. The Century Association was founded by members of New York's Sketch Club; preceding clubs also included the National Academy of Design, the Bread and Cheese Club, and the Column. Traditionally a men's club, women first became active in club life in the early 1900s; the organization began admitting women as members in 1988. Named after the first 100 people proposed as members, the first meeting on January 13, 1847 created the club known as the Century; it was incorporated in 1857. It was first housed at 495 Broadway in Lower Manhattan; the club gradually moved uptown, leading to the club's construction of its current location in 1899. During the Civil War, it became headquarters to the U.S. Sanitary Commission. 134 Centurions served in World War I; 110 served in World War II. The clubhouse, a five-story Palazzo style building, was designed by McKim, Mead & White and built from 1889 to 1891. It became a New York City Landmark in 1967 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was extensively renovated in the early 1990s, with a fifth floor and terrace constructed in 2009. Members of the club have included artists and writers William Cullen Bryant, Frederic Church, Asher B. Durand, John La Farge, Winslow Homer, Paul Manship, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Louis Comfort Tiffany, John Quincy Adams Ward, and J. Alden Weir. Architect members have included Calvert Vaux, Carr√®re and Hastings, Frederick Law Olmsted, James Renwick Jr., McKim, Mead & White, and York and Sawyer. Members are known for other endeavors, including eight Presidents of the United States, ten US Supreme Court justices, 43 Members of the Cabinet, 29 Nobel Prize laureates, members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Roosevelt, and Astor families, and noted individuals like Dan Beard, J. P. Morgan, Samuel Morse, and Anson Phelps Stokes. History The Century Association resulted from the merger of two earlier private clubs for men \\"of similar social standing or shared interests.\\" The Sketch Club had focused on literature and the arts, while the Column Club had been a Columbia University alumni organization. The initial invitation for the combined club was sent to one hundred men, which became the basis for the name \\"The Century\\", later slightly altered to the Century Association. The club rented a variety of temporary locations in Manhattan, gravitating to the area around Union Square and Madison Square. Among these locations were over Del Vecchio's picture store at 495 Broadway, 435 Broome Street, over a millinery shop at 575 Broadway, and 24 Clinton Place (later redesignated 46 East 8th Street). Rapid growth in membership to 250 led the club to incorporate and purchase a permanent location in 1857. Around 1985, the issue of admitting women into the club arose. Judge Robert Bork resigned from the association that year, having also signed a petition in favor of the club's admittance of female club members. Beginning in 1986, the city government began to investigate the club, along with two others, for discrimination against women. Public Law 63, a New York City law enacted in October 1984, made it illegal for clubs to discriminate based on sex, race, origin, or other factors, unless the club was \\"distinctly private\\", defined as having fewer than 400 members and not providing regular meals or collecting regular dues or payment from nonmembers. In 1987, the law was brought before the New York Court of Appeals; the Century vowed to follow the law and admit women if the law was upheld, or to do nothing if the law was repealed. The 1987 vote passed with 71 percent in favor; the first poll, in 1982, passed by 80 percent and a 1985 poll was almost evenly split. Some members declared that they would resign if the club refused to admit women; some declared they would resign if it did begin admitting them. Some members stated they would rather withdraw amenities and become a distinctly private club. The University Club, in the same predicament at the time, voted to not comply with the law, leaving the city to enforce it. Members were divided on the issue, as some found that the convening of \\"authors, artists and amateurs\\" would not change with the admittance of women; others determined \\"delightful difference of the sexes\\" was a benefit not to be eliminated by what was deemed a \\"fashionable whim\\". Women first were admitted as members to the club in 1988, after further contentious debates. In late 2010, the members of the Century Association began to debate whether the club should end its reciprocity agreement with the Garrick Club in London, which allowed women to enter only in the company of men. After debating, the members voted to end the reciprocity agreement on March 1, 2011. One Garrick Club member told London's Daily Telegraph that he \\"would not be mourning the loss of his colonial cousins ‚Äì or access to their facilities.\\" A male Century Association member told the New York Observer that giving up infrequent visits to the Garrick Club \\"versus condoning the discrimination of women\\" seemed like \\"a pretty easy trade-off\\". Locations and architecture =Early homes= The club's fourth home, on 8th Street, was first occupied by the association in 1852. Henry L. Pierson supervised the move-in, and used his collection of copies of casts of the works of Bertel Thorvaldsen to adorn the rooms. Other members gave similar artworks to decorate. It was kept like a residential home on the first floor, and with the oil paintings and small tables. =42 East 15th Street= 15th Street location The club's first permanent headquarters was an existing two-and-one-half-story residence at 42 East 15th Street, later redesignated 109‚Äì111, between Union Square East and Irving Place. Built in about 1847 and purchased by the Century Association in 1857 for $24,000, the dwelling was extensively remodeled four times during its 34 years as a clubhouse. The first time was immediately upon purchase under the direction of New York architect Joseph C. Wells, a Centurion. Expanded at a cost of $11,000, the renovated building was more than twice the size of the original house and styled like an Italian palazzo with facing of ashlar or possibly stucco treated to resemble ashlar masonry. Continuing its growth in both membership and programs during and after the Civil War, the Century Association required larger facilities. Although the club's members considered moving, financial constraints led them in 1867 to ask member and architect Charles D. Gambrill (1832‚Äì1880) to enlarge their existing structure. Gambrill's plans called for internal alterations, an expansion to the rear to accommodate an art gallery on the second floor and a billiard room on the main floor, a mansard roof, and a new unified, brick exterior trimmed with Lockport limestone. The rear extension was promptly completed, but for reasons no longer understood the rest of work was delayed until 1869. By the time construction began again, Gambrill had replaced his previous partner, George B. Post, with noted young architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838‚Äì1886), who had recently returned from his architectural training in France and joined the Century Association. It appears that Richardson helped change Gambrill's initial plans, making this one of his early works, before he became one of the most influential architects in the United States (Jeffrey Karl Ochsner calls it Richardson's eighth commission). The 1869 remodeling cost $21,000, and included an upwards expansion into a mansard-covered third floor. Completely eliminating the prior palazzo feel, it featured a unified neo-Grec style. Although Richardson would later develop a highly personal Romanesque style, his training at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris equipped him to design in neo-Grec with its abstracted classical features that worked well in modern materials such as the brick employed here. In 1878, Gambrill and Richardson dissolved their partnership, and in the same year Richardson made yet further modifications to the clubhouse. The building is the oldest surviving clubhouse in Manhattan, and has been a New York City landmark since 1993. The exterior was restored and the interior converted in 1996-97 by Beyer Blinder Belle, and in recent years it has been the Century Center for the Performing Arts, which had a 248-seat theatre, a ballroom and a studio. As of 2006 it is the New York production facility for Trinity Broadcasting Network, a religious television company.World's largest religious TV network buys performing arts center at the Cushman & Wakefield website (August 6, 2006) =Current location= In 1891, The Century Association left 15th Street for its current location, an Italian Renaissance-style palazzo at 7 West 43rd Street. At the time of the move the club had about 800 members.Mooney, James E. \\"Century Association\\" in McKim, Mead & White was retained; their design established a preferred style for private clubhouse buildings all over the United States in the following decades. The structure was designated a New York City Landmark in 1967, and has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. The clubhouse was restored by the architect Jan Hird Pokorny in 1992. Notable members The Century Association counts about 2,000 current members and a historical total of about 11,000 members. A number of members have made significant contributions in the fields of government, law, science, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others. Its members have included 29 Nobel Prize laureates, eight Presidents of the United States, ten US Supreme Court justices, 43 Members of the Cabinet, members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Roosevelt, and Astor families, and other noted individuals. Members are known as \\"Centurions.\\" Centurions who have attained the presidency include Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert C. Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

He had been active since the 1960s and his popularity peaked with the hit songs \\"Kamar Bareek-e- Man\\" and \\"Shanidam Az Inja Safar Mikoni.\\" Howaida was renowned for his deep, soulful voice.http://cultureandcuisine.com/afghan-food-and-music/ Almost all his songs were in the Dari Persian language. Aside from singing he also worked as a radio news anchor, poet, and as an actor on Afghanistan's television. In his later years, he lived a secluded life in Germany and seldom performed until his death there. Early life Mohammad Zahir Howaida was born in 1945 in Dai Zangi, Hazarajat. After the birth of Howaida, his father moved his family to Kabul and thereafter transferred to the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. While in Mazar-e-Sharif, Zahir Howida entered the first grade at the Sultan Ghiassuddin Elementary school in 1953. The same year Zahir's father died at the age of 33 leaving behind Zahir, his brother Kabir (who would later become a piano player) and widowed mother. The family moved to Kabul, where Zahir attended 2nd grade at the Sayed Jamaluddin Afghan elementary school. At the age of 13, Zahir's family moved to Booksellers Avenue of Kabul and subsequently entered Isteqlal High School, earning the highest ranking in his class. Zahir didn't find school curriculum very interesting and often cut class to walk across the school to the public library and borrow books of his interest and read. Zahir was a mandolin player and a backup singer for Akbar Ramish at the Isteqlal High school shows celebrating Afghan Independence Day. Naynawaz encouraged Zahir to sing solo, but he didn't find it suitable during the live show to sing at such a short notice. Hamid Estemadi who had a great voice but did not sing publicly since he was a member of the royal family encouraged Zahir to take his place at the Afghanistan Day show. Zahir was dragged on stage by Hamid and he sang his first song, but was faced with displeasure of the crowd. Moments later Zahir appeared in costume during a play and sang another song which delighted the audience and received an endurance of applause. Senior years Upon graduating high school, Zahir attended Institute of Theatre and Arts of Kabul and joined the Kabul Armature Orchestra led by Fazel Ahmad Zekria Naynawaz along with his brother Kabir Howaida, Rahim Mehryar, Rahim Jahani and more. At this orchestra Zahir showed immense talent as a vocalist and earned a scholarship to learn operatic and eastern classical music at Tchaikovsky Institute in Moscow in 1966. After Moscow he spend time in Tehran in 1972. There, he performed the song \\"Kamar Bareek-e-Man\\" which became an instant hit in Iran, where for years many Iranian singers covered the song in concerts and Iranian national television. Upon his return to Kabul, Zahir began his musical career which brought him overnight success. He composed all his songs with the exception of 4 songs which he often credited to their original composers Ahmad Zahir and Mashoor Jamal. The songs \\"Rasha dar dast baghban\\" and \\"Gar zolf preishanat\\" are of Ahmad Zahir and \\"Laila mah man shoda shaida\\" and \\"Ay mo telaie\\" are compositions of Jamal. Howaida was fond of tea and cigarettes. He also read many books about social and political issues. His favorite author was Maxim Gorky and favorite subject was socialism and social democratic ideas. Many of Howaida's songs are political in nature and anti-establishment. He often spoke out against the monarchy and the first president of the Afghan republic, Mohammad Daoud Khan. While all artists who wished to appear on National TV were authorized to sing in Persian. Howaida after the fall of the republic of Afghanistan into the hands of the Marxist communist regime found many opportunities on National Television and Radio Kabul. He recorded most of his songs during this tenure, hosting a variety of show on both mediums. After the fall of the communist government, Zahir and his family fled to Germany. He toured the world with stops on North America, Europe and Australia for his farewell concert where he broke his vow and sang in Pashto. He followed the concert with the release of his final album \\"Ay Kash\\". Personal life On 5 March 2012 as he was suffering from illness, Howaida died at the age of 67 at his home in Hamburg. Well-known singers from the worldwide Afghan diaspora attended his funeral in Hamburg.http://www.bbc.com/persian/afghanistan/2012/03/120309_l93_zaher_hoveida_funeral.shtml He left behind five children, of which two, Arash and Qais, followed the footsteps of their father into the music industry.

The line currently runs from the Wal-Mart parking lot in Catonsville, Maryland east through downtown Baltimore to the Fox Ridge community in Essex, serving the corridors of Edmondson Avenue on the west side and Eastern Avenue on the east, and the communities of Edmondson Village, Allendale, Rosemont, Patterson Park, and Eastpoint, and is one of the most heavily used bus routes operated by the MTA. The bus route is the successor to the 14 Ellicott City, 23 Back and Middle Rivers, and East Fayette Street streetcar lines. History Route 23 began its service as an electrified rail and streetcar line between Middle River and downtown Baltimore in 1897 along much of the same route as today. The streetcar operated until 1942, until the line was converted into a rubber-tire bus service.Baltimore Streetcars By Herbert H. Harwood, Paul W. Wirtz, page 4 During these years, Route 23 did not serve the west side of town at all. The western portion of today's route was primarily served by the no. 14 streetcar (no relationship to today's Route 14 that operates between Baltimore and Annapolis). Service was also provided through Essex and Middle River on the Back River Trolley.Essex and Middle River By M. Linda Martinak, Angela Martinak Sutherland, page 65 In 1942, the no. 23 streetcar service was discontinued.https://books.google.com/books?id=KwtfsspuhKoC&pg;=PT19&lpg;=PP1&dq;=herbert+harwood&ie;=ISO-8859-1&output;=html It was then replaced by Bus Route P, which operated until 1950. The no. 23 designation returned to Eastern Avenue on January 22, 1950. But westside service on this line did not begin until 1954, when Route 23 absorbed part of the route of the former Route 14, which had operated between Ellicott City and downtown Baltimore. Route 23 was extended west to Catonsville along the US 40 and the Edmondson Avenue corridor, serving Edmondson Village. At that time, the full route of Route 23 ran from Edmondson Village to Middle River.Baltimore Streetcars By Herbert H. Harwood, Paul W. Wirtz, pages 24-25 Over the years, a series of selected trips on each side of Route 23 were added. The communities served by these branches were: ;West side *Social Security (service was discontinued during first phase of the GBBI, and is available on Route 40) *US-40 and Rolling Road (main western terminus - now the parking lot of Catonsville Wal-Mart, formerly the Montgomery Ward shopping center, though at times, the layover was on Geipe Road on the other side of Rolling Road) *Wildwood Parkway (currently served by selected trips) ;East side *Bayview Medical Center (currently served on all trips) *Fox Ridge (current eastern terminus on all trips) *Hawthorne (discontinued during first phase of GBBI) *Oliver Beach (replaced by Route 160) *Pulaski Industrial Park (replaced by Route 24 during first phase of GBBI) *Victory Villa (served by Route 24 since 1993, exclusively by Route 24 after first phase of GBBI, and currently by Route 4) *Wilson Point (discontinued during first phase of GBBI) The Hawthorne, Wilson Point, and Victory Villa services were incorporations of the defunct Rosedale Passenger Lines, which provided shuttle services to Route 23. Over the years, Route 23 was heavily criticized. Riders complained of overcrowded buses, that the route was slow and unreliable, and that service to certain communities was sparsely provided. MTA was able to address some of these concerns. During the 1990s, additional trips were added on certain heavily used branches. In addition, Oliver Beach service, which operated to the farthest point from downtown, was moved to the express Route 160 for faster service, and selected Route 160 trips operated from Fox Ridge. In 1993, Route 24 was also modified to provide additional midday and weekend service to Victory Villa, from which riders could transfer to Route 23 to travel downtown. In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul for the region's transit system, Route 23 faced numerous changes. Initially, it was planned that the line would operate from Catonsville to Fox Ridge on all trips, with all other branches eliminated or replaced by other lines. Riders on the Middle River and Victory Villa branches were directed to transfer to/from Route 24, and all other riders were expected to walk to Eastern or Edmondson Avenues. However, after public outcry, the Wildwood branch was retained. The line also saw routing changes in the downtown area, and in East Baltimore. The route downtown was shifted from Saratoga Street to Fayette and Baltimore Streets, depending on the direction of travel, and in East Baltimore, service was shifted from Grundy/Haven Streets to Bayview Boulevard in order to serve Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. In addition, the line's frequency was cut virtually in half at most times. Rush hour service, which had operated every 7‚Äì8 minutes, was reduced to one bus every 15 minutes. Midday service, which had operated every 10‚Äì12 minutes, was reduced to one bus every 15 minutes. Saturday service was reduced from 15 to 30 minutes, and Sunday service from 30 minutes to hourly. The cost savings generated from the reduction in service was used to operate a new, limited-stop service known as Route 40 (now \\"QuickBus\\"). The line, which overlaps on much of the route, but serves the Security Boulevard corridor rather than Catonsville, provides limited-stop service for faster travel. MTA believed that operating such a service would absorb much of Route 23's ridership while improving bus service over the corridor. The overhaul of Route 23, which took effect on October 23, 2005, was not met pleasantly by riders. Many complained about the reduction in service while Route 40 did not stop near their streets, and did not meet their needs in any way. Also, some complained about routing changes. Most notably, businesses along Saratoga Street in downtown Baltimore reported a massive loss in customers who waited for buses near their shops. MTA responded to complaints about the Saratoga Street losses. On February 26, 2006, the no. 23 was once again modified to serve the small businesses on Saratoga Street while retaining part of its new route on the Fayette/Baltimore Street corridor. East of Middle River Currently, Route 23 does not provide any service east of Back River Neck Road, but the line did in the past. Today, riders wishing to travel to points along the Eastern Boulevard corridor east of Back River Neck Road must transfer to another line. Service is available in this area on several other routes. Route 4 operates along Eastern between North Point Boulevard and Martin Boulevard. Regular service from Middle River to Whispering Woods is provided on Route 24. Route 160 provides four express trips daily to/from Oliver Beach. In popular culture Detective Jimmy McNulty rides the 23 Edmondson Village bus to a crime scene in season 5 episode 2 of The Wire.

Over the years following their meeting, Cohen and Martin worked on numerous musical projects together, eventually getting an invitation to perform in the Mission Creek Music and Arts Festival. Unfortunately, their project at the time, Feller Quentin, no longer existed when the festival came around. Not wanting to miss out, Cohen and Martin convinced percussionist Jon Bernson to join the band with his friends, synth player Jason Chavez and keyboardist Joe Roberts. The newly formed band was called Black Fiction. Anthony Marin, who plays the drums, glockenspiel and triangle, joined on soon after.

Her sole respondent, Raul Ferraro (Federico Luppi) turns out to be a Gentile from Uruguay. Clara at first spurns him, but soon she realizes she needs him: Her brother is coming to visit her from Boston, and she has been lying to him about being in a romantic relationship.

It's a tribute to these stars that, even given the trite situation of the love-shy odd couple gradually facing the inevitable, every halting step they take toward each other feels like a mini-triumph of love's power over the schoolmarmish intellect. They portray with touching specificity what it's like to crave total surrender to love even after long years of experience have proven the foolhardiness of such blind leaps. Not even the blatantly market- tested ending (a malady that seems to be spreading worldwide like Hong Kong flu) detracts from the pleasure of this admirable, eminently watchable date flick.

In the differential geometry of surfaces in three dimensions, umbilics or umbilical points are points on a surface that are locally spherical. At such points the normal curvatures in all directions are equal, hence, both principal curvatures are equal, and every tangent vector is a principal direction. The name \\"umbilic\\" comes from the Latin umbilicus - navel. Umbilic points generally occur as isolated points in the elliptical region of the surface; that is, where the Gaussian curvature is positive. The sphere is the only surface with non-zero curvature where every point is umbilic. A flat umbilic is an umbilic with zero Gaussian curvature. The monkey saddle is an example of a surface with a flat umbilic and on the plane every point is a flat umbilic. A torus can have no umbilics, but every closed surface of nonzero Euler characteristic, embedded smoothly into Euclidean space, has at least one umbilic. An unproven conjecture of Constantin Carath√©odory states that every smooth topological sphere in Euclidean space has at least two umbilics.. The three main type of umbilic points are elliptical umbilics, parabolic umbilics and hyperbolic umbilics. Elliptical umbilics have the three ridge lines passing through the umbilic and hyperbolic umbilics have just one. Parabolic umbilics are a transitional case with two ridges one of which is singular. Other configurations are possible for transitional cases. These cases correspond to the D4‚àí, D5 and D4+ elementary catastrophes of Ren√© Thom's catastrophe theory. Umbilics can also be characterised by the pattern of the principal direction vector field around the umbilic which typically form one of three configurations: star, lemon, and lemonstar (or monstar). The index of the vector field is either ‚àí¬Ω (star) or ¬Ω (lemon, monstar). Elliptical and parabolic umbilics always have the star pattern, whilst hyperbolic umbilics can be star, lemon, or monstar. This classification was first due to Darboux and the names come from Hannay. For surfaces with genus 0 with isolated umbilics, e.g. an ellipsoid, the index of the principle direction vector field must be 2 by the Poincar√©‚ÄìHopf theorem. Generic genus 0 surfaces have at least four umbilics of index ¬Ω. An ellipsoid of revolution has two non-generic umbilics each of which has index 1.Porteous, p 208 Image:TensorStar.pngStar Image:TensorMonstar.pngMonstar Image:TensorLemon.pngLemon Classification of umbilics =Cubic forms= The classification of umbilics is closely linked to the classification of real cubic forms a x^3 + 3 b x^2 y + 3 c x y^2 + d y^3. A cubic form will have a number of root lines \\\\lambda (x,y) such that the cubic form is zero for all real \\\\lambda. There are a number of possibilities including: *Three distinct lines: an elliptical cubic form, standard model x^2 y-y^3. *Three lines, two of which are coincident: a parabolic cubic form, standard model x^2 y. *A single real line: a hyperbolic cubic form, standard model x^2 y+y^3. *Three coincident lines, standard model x^3. The equivalence classes of such cubics under uniform scaling form a three-dimensional real projective space and the subset of parabolic forms define a surface ‚Äì called the umbilic bracelet by Christopher Zeeman. Taking equivalence classes under rotation of the coordinate system removes one further parameter and a cubic forms can be represent by the complex cubic form z^3+3 \\\\overline{\\\\beta} z^2 \\\\overline{z} + 3 \\\\beta z \\\\overline{z}^2 + \\\\overline{z}^3 with a single complex parameter \\\\beta. Parabolic forms occur when \\\\beta=\\\\tfrac{1}{3}(2 e^{i\\\\theta}+e^{-2 i\\\\theta}), the inner deltoid, elliptical forms are inside the deltoid and hyperbolic one outside. If \\\\left \\\\beta\\\\right =1 and \\\\beta is not a cube root of unity then the cubic form is a right-angled cubic form which play a special role for umbilics. If \\\\left \\\\beta\\\\right =\\\\tfrac{1}{3} then two of the root lines are orthogonal. A second cubic form, the Jacobian is formed by taking the Jacobian determinant of the vector valued function F : \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^2, F(x,y)=(x^2+y^2,a x^3 + 3 b x^2 y + 3 c x y^2 + d y^3). Up to a constant multiple this is the cubic form b x^3+(2 c-a)x^2 y+(d-2 b)x y^2-c y^3. Using complex numbers the Jacobian is a parabolic cubic form when \\\\beta=-2 e^{i\\\\theta}-e^{-2 i\\\\theta}, the outer deltoid in the classification diagram. =Umbilic classification= Umbilic classification, the \\\\beta‚Äîplane. The Inner deltoid give parabolic umbilics, separates elliptical and hyperbolic umbilics. Cusps on inner deltoid: cubic umbilics. Outer circle, the birth of umbilics separates star and monstar configurations. Outer deltoid, separates monstar and lemon configuration. Diagonals and the horizontal line - symmetrical umbilics with mirror symmetry. Any surface with an isolated umbilic point at the origin can be expressed as a Monge form parameterisation z=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\kappa(x^2+y^2)+\\\\tfrac{1}{3}(a x^3 + 3 b x^2 y + 3 c x y^2 + d y^3)+\\\\ldots, where \\\\kappa is the unique principal curvature. The type of umbilic is classified by the cubic form from the cubic part and corresponding Jacobian cubic form. Whilst principal directions are not uniquely defined at an umbilic the limits of the principal directions when following a ridge on the surface can be found and these correspond to the root-lines of the cubic form. The pattern of lines of curvature is determined by the Jacobian. The classification of umbilic points is as follows: *Inside inner deltoid - elliptical umbilics **On inner circle - two ridge lines tangent *On inner deltoid - parabolic umbilics *Outside inner deltoid - hyperbolic umbilics **Inside outer circle - star pattern **On outer circle - birth of umbilics **Between outer circle and outer deltoid - monstar pattern **Outside outer deltoid - lemon pattern *Cusps of the inner deltoid - cubic (symbolic) umbilics *On the diagonals and the horizontal line - symmetrical umbilics with mirror symmetry In a generic family of surfaces umbilics can be created, or destroyed, in pairs: the birth of umbilics transition. Both umbilics will be hyperbolic, one with a star pattern and one with a monstar pattern. The outer circle in the diagram, a right angle cubic form, gives these transitional cases. Symbolic umbilics are a special case of this. Focal surface A surface with an elliptical umbilic, and its focal surface. A surface with a hyperbolic umbilic and its focal surface. The elliptical umbilics and hyperbolic umbilics have distinctly different focal surfaces. A ridge on the surface corresponds to a cuspidal edges so each sheet of the elliptical focal surface will have three cuspidal edges which come together at the umbilic focus and then switch to the other sheet. For a hyperbolic umbilic there is a single cuspidal edge which switch from one sheet to the other.  Definition in higher dimension in Riemannian manifolds A point p in a Riemannian submanifold is umbilical if, at p, the (vector-valued) Second fundamental form is some normal vector tensor the induced metric (First fundamental form). Equivalently, for all vectors U, V at p, II(U, V) = gp(U, V) u, where u is the mean curvature vector at p. A submanifold is said to be umbilic (or all- umbilic) if this condition holds at every point \\"p\\". This is equivalent to saying that the submanifold can be made totally geodesic by an appropriate conformal change of the metric of the surrounding (\\"ambient\\") manifold. For example, a surface in Euclidean space is umbilic if and only if it is a piece of a sphere.

Early life Henry Roe Cloud was born December 28, 1884, a member of the Bird Clan, on the Winnebago Reservation in northeastern Nebraska and was orphaned when his parents died in 1896 and 1897. After his education in a series of government schools, his intellectual ambition, academic performance, and personal qualities brought him in 1901 to the private Mount Hermon Preparatory School (now Northfield Mount Hermon School) in Massachusetts. He financed his education through the school's work-study program and was introduced to the social circles of America's ruling elite. He graduated a salutatorian in 1906 and the school served as his conduit into the Ivy League. College education Cloud was the first full-blood Native American to attend Yale University. He graduated with a bachelor of arts (B.A.) in psychology and philosophy from Yale College in 1910 and earned a master of arts (M.A.) degree in anthropology from Yale University in 1914.Some online resources list Cloud's Yale master degree year as \\"1912\\" though the actual degree states \\"MCMXIV\\" (1914). Ravi D. Goel Collection on Henry Roe Cloud (MS 2008). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library. He was a campus celebrity due to the force of his personality and speaking skills, and in an era when rhetoric was an art, he was especially accomplished, attracting large audiences on campus and in national venues. One measure of his prestige as an undergraduate was being tapped for the Yale senior society, Elihu. Roe advocated for Indians to make a space for themselves in higher education both while still at Yale and shortly after. In 1914, he protested census figures of college attendance - noting that only a minute fraction of the Indian population was college bound. Shortly after, in the late 1920s Meriam Report, Roe Cloud voiced outrage at the under-education of Indians. Scholars such as Joel Pfister compare Roe Cloud's ideology on the education of Indian minorities to W.E.B. Dubois' theory of the \\"Talented Tenth\\" in African American culture. Roe Cloud helped organize efforts to form an Indian \\"Talented Tenth.\\" While an undergraduate, Cloud attended a lecture by the missionary, Mary Wickham Roe, a member of a prominent Yankee family involved in evangelical Christian mission work. He established a close relationship with her and her husband, Reverend Dr. Walter C. Roe. The couple adopted him, and he took their surname as his middle name. From 1910-1911 he studied sociology at Oberlin College. He attended Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, where he earned a bachelor of divinity degree and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1913. He returned to school and received a doctorate of divinity from Emporia College, Kansas in 1932. Career In a dissertation by a Purdue University scholar, Cloud's significance is described \\"as a reformer, an educator, and Indian Service official. As a prominent Indian figure of the 1920s and 1930s, Cloud's life demonstrates how and to what extent Indians were able to influence federal Indian policy. His life also provides a window into the close ties between progressive ideas and the evangelical Protestant Christianity that prompted and guided many of the reform efforts in the first decades of the twentieth century. Cloud's work also shows him to be capable of moving beyond this Progressive Era paradigm of assimilation and embracing new currents of reform such as the push for cultural pluralism.\\" His career with the Office of Indian Affairs and the Brookings Institution focused on the efforts to establish modern schools for Native American youth. He became superintendent of the Haskell Institute, now known as Haskell Indian Nations University, in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1933. \\"Cloud was instrumental in winning acceptance of the Wheeler-Howard Act, known also as the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.\\" In 1947, he was appointed the Superintendent of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. \\"In 1948, he was appointed regional representative for the Grande Ronde and Siletz Indian Agencies in Oregon.\\"  Family  Henry Roe Cloud's wife, Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud (1888-1965), spoke widely on American Indian affairs, and served on the Indian Welfare Committee for the General Federation of Women‚Äôs Clubs, and won the American Mother of the Year Award in 1950 for her work. His granddaughter, Renya Ramirez, is an American Studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Death and legacy Henry Roe Cloud died of a heart attack in Siletz, Oregon, on February 9, 1950. He was buried in Beaverton, Oregon. An entry on Cloud is included in the American National Biography, Vol 5 (1999) and his personal papers are housed as a distinct series in the \\"Roe Family Papers\\" in Sterling Memorial Library's Manuscripts and Archives collection at Yale University. The majority of Cloud's papers, personal photographs, and documents (relating to Yale and the Mount Hermon school) and theological society parchments as well as papers from his work until his death in 1950 were in the care of Henry's Great Grandson, Shahn Roe Cloud Hughes in Portland, Oregon. In November 2014, the items were donated to the Yale University Library, Manuscripts and Archives. They are part of the Ravi D Goel Collection on Henry Roe Cloud. Collection highlights include Cloud's candid thoughts on many Indian tribes, leading figures and the state of US-Indian affairs. Almost all of the letters were addressed to his fourth and youngest daughter. A detailed April 1937 letter addresses Cloud's views on the Crees, Joseph Dussome, Baptiste Samatt, and Rocky Boy Superintendent Earl Wooldridge. In a February 14, 1938 letter, Cloud writes about a reunion with his Yale 1910 classmate and then Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting. (See also Yale Manuscripts and Archives April 2015 blog, \\"Party Diplomacy: The Ravi D.

Originally the \\"M\\" was on Duncan Hill in 1919. In 1928‚Äì29 the block M was made in its current location out of plain rocks over about an acre of land. In 1930 the \\"M\\" was whitewashed to enhance visibility and has been whitewashed in every weather-permitting year since. The whitewashing tradition was originally called May Day in 1942 but has since been shortened to M-day. In 1977 the class of 1978 created the number \\"78\\" to the right of the \\"M\\" for their graduation year. On M-day (which typically takes place the last week of school), freshmen, sophomores, and juniors clear vegetation from around the M and whitewash it to keep it visible. In addition, the juniors change the number to the right of the \\"M\\" to the last two digits of their graduation year. As a tradition, the outline of the \\"M\\" is often lit up during homecoming week. =Letter-lighting= The letter-lighting tradition began in 1931. Each year during homecoming week, students from each class fill white paper bags with dirt and place a candle in each. These bags are used to outline shapes for their class (S for seniors, J for juniors, S for sophomores, and F for freshmen). The bags are laid out in the nearby fairgrounds in the grandstand arena, and at night the candles are lit. Letter- lighting at the current location in the fairgrounds began in either 2001 or 2002. Previously letter-lighting took place by students collecting cans, filling them with used motor oil, and outlining their class letters on the mountainside up Manti Canyon over the old gravel pit. When the tradition began in 1931 the letters were arranged vertically with the senior \\"S \\"at the top. Later the letters were arranged to be horizontally in line with each other. The tradition also included a bonfire and hot-dog roast at Brox's Campgrounds. The indefinite moving of the tradition to the fairgrounds in 2001 or 2002 was due to worries about fire and environmental damage from the oil.

It stars Laurent Terzieff, Paul Frankeur, Delphine Seyrig, Georges Marchal and Michel Piccoli. Bu√±uel later called The Milky Way the first in a trilogy (along with The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Phantom of Liberty) about \\"the search for truth.\\" The title of the film is taken from a popular name used for the Way of St. James, a route often traveled by religious pilgrims that stretched from northern Europe to the Santiago de Compostela in Spain. This is where the remains of St. James were reputed to be buried.Bu√±uel, Luis. My Last Sigh. Trans. Abigail Israel. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003. . page 245. The film follows the picaresque journey of two vagabond travelers, who seem to be making the pilgrimage as a means of escape. Along the way, they witness a series of bizarre incidents that involve persons named in documented heresies in church history. At key moments they encounter Jesus and the Virgin Mary, as well as modern believers and fanatics. The plot is non-linear and functions as a highly symbolic travelogue across time and space, set over the last two thousand years. It encompasses much of Christian history. While using satire to critique religion from a skeptical perspective, it also explores the act of spiritual quest and search for meaning. The highly idiosyncratic film originally met with limited success. In the 21st century, it is very well- regarded amongst film enthusiasts and critics. Plot Two French vagrants, Pierre and Jean, decide to take the pilgrimage route from Paris to Santiago de Compostela along the traditional Way of St. James. As they walk along a roadside in France, they encounter a man in a black cape who tells them to sleep with a prostitute and have children with her, an instance of the prophecy in Hosea. Then the pilgrims reach an inn, they find a police sergeant and a priest discussing the nature of the eucharist and transubstantiation. The priest is taken away by staff from a nearby mental hospital. Later, the pilgrims find shelter for the night on a farm, while a secret Priscillian sect is meeting nearby. Their secret service involves ritual repetition, a short statement of faith, followed by sexual encounters between the male and female congregation. Next, the pilgrims seek food from an expensive restaurant, whose manager is explaining to his staff the controversy of the divinity of Jesus Christ as debated during the First Council of Nicaea. Later, the pilgrims pass by a boarding school, and watch the children perform for their parents and teachers. As a class of young girls recites heresies and proclaim them \\"anathema\\", one of the pilgrims imagines the execution of a pope by a band of revolutionaries. After they curse a passing car, it crashes and the driver is killed. Investigating the wreckage, they encounter a strange man, maybe the Devil, who gives one of the pilgrims the dead man's shoes. At a chapel along the way, the pilgrims encounter a group of Jansenist nuns, who are nailing one of their group to a wooden cross. Outside, a Jesuit and a Jansenist have a sword duel, while arguing over doctrines of predestination and irresistible grace for sinners. Finally, the two pilgrims reach Spain, where they agree to take care of a donkey for two other men. These new men leave the pilgrims travel to a nearby abbey where they watch the official desecration of a priest's grave because of the discovery of heretical posthumous writings regarding the nature of the trinity. The two men proclaim loudly that the Godhead is not trinitarian and escape. In the forest, they switch clothes with some hunters swimming in a lake, and destroy by gunfire a rosary discovered in one of their pockets. Later that night, a vision of the Virgin Mary appears to them and returns the rosary. The two men and the original pilgrims meet again at an inn, where they tell a local priest about their recent miraculous vision. The priest recounts another miracle, in which the Virgin Mary takes the form and duties of an errant nun for several years until the nun returns to the convent as if she had never left. Later that night, the priest further explains how her virginity must have remained intact during both the spiritual conception and the physical birth of Jesus, like \\"sunshine penetrating a window\\". On the outskirts of Santiago de Compostela, the two pilgrims meet a prostitute who wants to become pregnant and gives the same names for the children as those predicted by the man in the cape at the beginning of the film. In the last episode of the film, two blind men encounter Jesus and his disciples. Their blindness is healed but they cannot understand what they are seeing or walk unaided.

These religious events are based on actual historical documents. For instance, the archbishop whose corpse is exhumed and publicly burned is based on Archbishop Carranza of Toledo. The film ends with the following text: The Milky Way plays with time. The two main characters often encounter individuals in the dress of various time periods throughout history, or historical events take place in the modern setting of the film, including scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. In his autobiography, Bu√±uel explains that he wanted to put Jesus Christ in the film because he \\"wanted to show him as an ordinary man, laughing, running, mistaking his way, preparing to shave ‚Äî to show, in other words, all those aspects completely alien to our traditional iconography.\\" Often, these encounters involve conversations or arguments regarding a specific Catholic doctrine or heresy, and are intended to show the absurdity of making absolute statements about such topics as a \\"matter of fact\\". Two heresies prominent in the film are Priscillianism and Jansenism. Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports 93% approval for The Milky Way, with an average rating of 7.7/10 among 14 critics.

Since its founding, CalTV has grown into one of the largest student-run media organizations on the West Coast and is currently a chartered organization of the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC).  History  Although there had been multiple attempts to get a television station for Berkeley off the ground, it wasn't until Spring 2005 that the ASUC was able to allocate sufficient seed money towards setting up an online TV network.  Technology  CalTV uses web and digital media technologies to produce its online broadcasts. As its web platform, CalTV uses standards compliant and customized content management system coupled with the YouTube's online video player. CalTV produces video content using a Canon 60D DSLR and Adobe Creative Cloud software running on Apple iMac G5.  Content  Seven different departments make up CalTV- four on-camera and three behind- the-scenes. They include: On-Camera * News * Sports * Entertainment * Comedy Behind-the-Scenes * Post-Production * Cinematography * Business/Advertising/Marketing (BAM) The station's content has evolved with time. In its first iteration, the station produced a single show focusing exclusively on news events (local, national and international) but produced in a citizen journalism mode. The show featured brief backgrounds on stories introduced by CalTV journalists followed by opinion from Berkeley students and professors. With time, CalTV's content expanded into sports, arts and eventually entertainment. \\"The CalTV Sports Highlight\\" was born in 2006 and covered California football, baseball, water polo and much more. The semester of Spring 2007 marked the debut of \\"The CalTV Show\\", an off-beat news show offering a summary of local and national news as well as commentary on issues of concern to students. \\"The CalTV Show\\" has now since been renamed \\"The CalBear Report.\\" CalTV sports features high octane highlights of Cal sports action, including \\"The CalTV Sports Highlight\\" which airs every Monday. Also included in the programming are CalTV sports' \\"Back and Forth\\" and \\"Sports Shorts.\\" \\"Back and Forth\\" resembles ESPN's Pardon the Interruption and features banter on all sports related topics from the Cal Football Team to Women's Field Hockey. \\"Sports Shorts\\" features updates on recent teams in action, as well as interviews with students on Sproul Plaza. A new show, \\"Bear in Mind\\" has since also been added and cover many off-the-field stories on student athletes and teams. CalTV News features many informative weekly shows including Berkeley Beat, CalConnect, InFocus, and Investigative Report. CalTV debuted its Entertainment programming in 2010 when the former Music Department officially changed its name to Entertainment.  Special events  CalTV has also been involved in the coverage of many on-campus and off-campus special events. These events included exclusive interviews with such celebrities as: * Jesse Eisenberg * Andrew Garfield * Channing Tatum * Michael Moore * Danny Boyle * Morgan Spurlock * Ryan Reynolds * Chelsea Clinton * John C.

Generally, it is a medley of well-known songs, in which all the lyrics have been changed to celebrate (or poke fun at) the guests of honor. A typical kapustnik may have several scenes, lasting approximately 10 minutes, and is performed by one or more singers or actors with piano accompaniment, or karaoke-style playback.  Background  = Origins = The Russian word kapustnik refers to cabbage, or cabbage pie. In the 18th century, kapustniki referred to ‚Äúharvesting and processing cabbage at the invitation of one's neighbors‚Äù.Sharapova, Olga. \\"Kapustnik\\". Russian Life 49.2 (2006): 51‚Äì58. It usually involved the women of a village gathering to chop cabbage‚Äîwhich happened to be a long and laborious event. This pertained to the forty days of Lent; people had to abstain from meat, milk, and other animal products, which made cabbage the common food in meals. After chopping the cabbage up and soaking it in brine, people were able to get much of the nutrition they lacked during winter months. The kapustnik pie was baked using the leftover cabbage from the brining barrel. The women at these gatherings often enjoyed each other's company, talking, gossiping, and singing among other things. As Lent restricted the Russians' diet as well as social activity, kapustniki in the form variety shows began in the 19th century. Like cabbage pie, a kapustnik showcases its variety of layers that make up a delicious‚Äîand entertaining‚Äîproduct. They were often performed at this time in houses of Russian nobility. = Theatre tradition = Outside of parties, kapustniki are a tradition in Russian theatre. To have one, actors choose an evening when no performance is planned and show their own funny plays for each other. Although rarely is anyone from outside the theatre's staff invited, many fans try to get in anyway. Due to their questionable copyright, kapustniks can rarely be broadcast or recorded. An important person in the kapustnik history is Mikhail Shchepkin, one of Russia's most famous actors who rose in fame at the Moscow Maly Theater in the middle of the 19th century. He hosted a great number of post-show parties at his home, where, as a skilled storyteller, he would grab everyone's attention. These gatherings involved much game-playing and improvised performances for actors and writers to poke fun at one another; this came to be known as the satirical kapustnik.Sharapova, 51‚Äì58 It was not until the early 20th century that the kapustnik became an official form of theatre; the first paying one was staged in 1910 at the Moscow Arts Theatre. This public kapustnik had evolved because the audience was now involved and most productions included satire of current events. This new humor typically poked fun at tricky, intelligent jokes rather than playful ones. Constantin Stanislavski, director of the theatre at the time of the premiere, helped influence the form of other successful ones to come. He was very skilled and understanding of the specific humor needed for kapustniki: ‚ÄúIt was just a comic dig at pretense, a caricature of the funny side of things, a satire on the corruptibility [of real problems].‚Äù The following is a description of a typical successful act (here a circus act in the middle of a kapustnik): \\"Stanislavsky, as the ringmaster, appeared in top hat and tails, with a huge nose and black mustache. He cracked a whip, and onto the stage galloped a trained stallion, played by another actor. The sketch ended with a quadrille performed by the whole troupe, riding on hobby- horses.\\" = Kapustiki (village dances) = In a typical Russian village, kapustiki (a variety word of kapustniki) dancing activities followed a night of games and songs. Spring was a popular time for these. Often good-humored and sentimental, the games ranged from ‚Äúbride and groom‚Äù games to ‚ÄúZavivat Berezku‚Äù, which involved curling the branches of a birch tree (Russia's national tree) to attract a boyfriend. There were bonfires and mummers wearing animal masks to add to the festivities. The kapustiki dances are accompanied by flutes and balalaikas. Kapustiki have not always been accepted in Russia's changing society. When Christianity became the prominent religion in a region, priests often prohibited dances, like the kapustiki, and replaced them by sviatye or ‚Äúsaintly‚Äù events, created to ensure appropriate censorship from sin for the people.Uralskaya, Valeria I., Maria I.

Personal life Hudson is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma and Georgetown University Law Center. He is married to Leslie Hudson, a public health professional and former associate professor at the University of Oklahoma, with whom he has two sons. In his spare time, he has been a member of the Sonic Tones, an eight-member band made up of senior executives of the Sonic Corporation, which competed in the 2003 Battle of the Corporate Bands at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio. Career After graduating from law school and several years as a practicing attorney, he was hired as the head of the legal department for Sonic Corp in 1984. He became president and chief executive officer in 1995, and was named chairman in January 2000. During his tenure, the company grew from a nationwide total of 1,428 locations in 1995 to more than 3,500 today, with locations in 45 of the 50 US states. In addition, average drive-in sales have increased by 65% and system-wide sales from $880 million to $4.5 billion. The company's enterprise value grew from approximately $200 million to more than $2.3 billion, when it was acquired by Inspire Brands in 2018. Master of None Since his departure from Sonic Corp. in early 2019, Cliff has been sharing his philosophy on becoming a ‚ÄúMaster of None‚Äù. In February 2019, he was the James R. Wilson annual guest lecturer at The College of Wooster (Ohio) where he unveiled plans to release a book on the topic. Over the last two years, he has been working on this, his first book, entitled Master of None - How a Jack-of-All-Trades Can Still Reach the Top. This personal story of his lifelong development of leadership skills challenges established thinking, offering counter-intuitive career advice essential to professionals at all levels, for the person just starting out or in the middle of their career. Publishing house HarperCollins is set to release Master of None in October 2020. Master of None offers a different way forward, to help businesses and professionals thrive at all levels. One key take-away is that it‚Äôs okay to embrace life as a master of none, being comfortable with potentiality and variety, allowing yourself to thrive in unfamiliar environments, and seizing opportunities that you didn‚Äôt see coming. Above all, Master of None calls the reader to appreciate that flexibility and adaptation is the foundation for success in work and in life.

El Conde de Florida Blanca, Chief Minister of Spain and signatory of the Treaty. The two countries attempted to finalise their borders by the 1750 Treaty of Madrid but in 1761, it was annulled by the new Spanish monarch Charles III. In 1762, Spain entered the Seven Years' War on the side of France; while an invasion of Portugal ended in disaster, the Spanish captured Colonia del Sacramento, now in Uruguay and much of the modern day Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Colonia del Sacramento was returned to Portugal by the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Over the next decade, Portugal reoccupied Rio Grande do Sul in an undeclared war before formal hostilities commenced in the 1776-1777 Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese War. In February 1777, a Spanish expeditionary force of 116 ships and 19,000 troops captured the island of Santa Catarina in February before moving against Colonia del Sacramento which surrendered in July. Fighting ended in February 1777 when Joseph I of Portugal died and his daughter, Spanish-born Maria I, sued for peace. The First Treaty of San Ildefonso signed on 1 October 1777 established a Boundary Commission to demarcate borders between the two Empires in the R√≠o de la Plata region. These were later confirmed by the Treaty of El Pardo. Provisions The Treaty confirmed the findings of the Boundary Commission, Portugal gaining possession of modern day Brazil while ceding Colonia del Sacramento to Spain. It also included a number of commercial clauses, the most significant being the regulation of the tobacco and slave trades. Spain regained a base for the African slave trade it relinquished in the 1479 Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas, with the acquisition of the Portuguese islands of Annob√≥n and Bioko or Fern√£o P√≥, plus the mainland between the Niger River and the Ogoue River. These possessions were administered by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata whose capital was Buenos Aires. Aftermath Spanish hopes settling the border would help economic growth were hampered by the 1779-1783 war with Britain that restricted trade with mainland Spain and led to high tariffs and taxes to pay for it. Portugal regained the Misiones Orientales in the Treaty of Badajoz (1801) while the Napoleonic Wars and the loss of much of the Spanish navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 severed links between the central government and their overseas possessions. Between 1809-1829, the Spanish American wars resulted in the independence of Spanish colonies in the Americas, the Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata being dissolved during the 1810-1818 Argentine War of Independence. The territories in Africa gained by the Treaty of El Pardo became the colony of Spanish Guinea. Annob√≥n and Bioko had been relatively neglected by the Portuguese, who focused instead on S√£o Tom√©; with the gradual abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in the first half of the 19th century, these lost much of their value to Spain. In 1968, Spanish Guinea became the independent country of Equatorial Guinea.

They extend north-south for about 30 miles (50 km) along the Continental Divide,Since both of the neighboring valleys are closed drainage basins, the designation of the Continental Divide in this region is somewhat arbitrary. from near the town of Animas to a few miles north of the border with Mexico. The range is about 12 miles (20 km) wide at its widest. The highest point of the range is the southern summit of the mile-long Animas Peak massif, . (Animas Peak itself is the slightly lower north summit, 8,531 ft/2,600 m.) The Animas Mountains lie between the Animas Valley on the west and the Playas Valley on the east. Nearby ranges include the Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County), across the Animas Valley, and the Big Hatchet and Little Hatchet Mountains, across the Playas Valley. Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, Physiographically, the range divides into two parts. The compact southern part, which includes Animas Peak, is higher and wider, rising up to 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above the nearby valleys. It has a sky island character, with dense coniferous forests at the higher elevations.Animas Mountains at the New Mexico Audubon Society The longer, narrow northern portion is lower, reaching only 7,310 ft (2,228 m) at Gillespie Peak, and is characterized by grassland and pi√±on-juniper woods and shrubs. The Animas Mountains lie near the Chihuahuan Desert, the Sonoran Desert, the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico, and the mountains surrounding the headwaters of the Gila River. Biotic influences from these regions, as well as the more distant Rocky Mountains, give the southern portion of the range a great diversity of species, including \\"approximately 130 species of birds, 60 species of mammals, and 40 species of reptiles.\\" History and current management Sunrise view of the Hatchet Mountains from the Continental Divide Trail near its southern terminus at Crazy Cook Most of the range is encompassed in the Diamond A Ranch (formerly the Gray Ranch), which is owned and managed by the Animas Foundation. The 321,000 acre (1,299 km¬≤) ranch (more than one third the size of the state of Rhode Island - 3140 km2) was bought in 1990 by The Nature Conservancy, which took the unusual step of selling it in the mid-1990s to the Animas Foundation, a private organization founded by poet and rancher Drummond Hadleyhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4958683 and funded in part by the Anheuser-Busch family (as opposed to selling it to an arm of the U.S. government). The Foundation is intended to practice \\"sustainable agriculture in harmony with the environment.\\" The Animas Foundation is one cooperating landowner within the Malpai Borderlands Group, a collaborative group in the region involving local landowners, local, state and federal agencies, universities, and environmental organizations. \\"The Animas Foundation is particularly important to the group in that they own more than a third of the planning area.\\" Access to the ranch, and hence to portions of the Animas Mountains, is tightly controlled, with little or no public recreational use opportunities. As a result, the Continental Divide Trail had to be rerouted from the true Continental Divide near Antelope Wells, New Mexico to the current, official beginning of the CDT at Crazy Cook in the Big Hatchet Mountains.

At that time, it covered northern counties of the historic province of Lesser Poland, including such cities as Radom, Czƒôstochowa and Sosnowiec. On April 1, 1938, its borders changed, see: Territorial changes of Polish Voivodeships on April 1, 1938. Capital city: Kielce. Location and area In early 1939, Voivodeship's area was 22 204 square kilometers. It was located in central Poland, bordering Germany and Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship to the west, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship and Warsaw Voivodeship to the north, Lublin Voivodeship and Lw√≥w Voivodeship to the east and Krak√≥w Voivodeship to the south. Landscape was flat in the northern part and hilly in mid and south, with the Swietokrzyskie Mountains located in the heart of the area. Forests covered 21.2%, with the national average 22.2% (as for January 1, 1937).  Population According to the 1931 Polish census, the population was 2 671 000. Poles made 88.9% of population, Jews - 10.7%. The latter preferred to live in the cities and towns - in 1931 Jews made 28.7% of Voivodeship's cities inhabitants. Illiterate (in 1931) was 25.7%, higher than the national average of 23.1%. Industry Kielce Voivodeship was very divided in industrial terms. Its western part, with such cities as Czƒôstochowa, Sosnowiec or Bƒôdzin was highly industrialized and urbanized, with numerous coalmines. Also Radom, located in the north, was a big industrial center, together with newly built or newly industrialized nearby towns Pionki and Starachowice. Eastern part, on the other hand, was backward, with little industry and underdeveloped agriculture. In mid-1930s Polish government started a huge public works program, called Centralny Okreg Przemyslowy, which was a great boost to overpopulated and poor central and eastern counties. Cities and administrative divisions Between April 1, 1938, and September 1, 1939, it consisted of 18 powiats (counties).

He was living in Newcastle, Northumberland in 1901,UK Census, 1901. and in St Thomas, Exeter in Devon in 1911.UK Census, 1911. He died in December 1929 in the London Borough of Hackney. Career His early works as a translator included a number of works of French erotica for Paris- based speciality publisher Charles Carrington in the late 1880s and 1890s. Later he branched out into mainstream French literature, including works of various serious and popular authors. He participated with other translators in two ambitious early twentieth century projects to render the works of Anatole France and Alexandre Dumas into English. He also translated a number of children's books and historical works, and, late in his career, a number of volumes of the sensationalist Fant√¥mas detective novels. Allinson's sole work of note as an original author was The Days of the Directoire (1910), a historical and social portrait of France during the period of the French Revolution. His aim in this work was \\"to present a vivid account of the extraordinary years from 1795 to 1799, when the Five Directors ruled France from the Palace of the Luxembourg; to portray the chief actors of those stirring times; and to draw a picture of the social conditions prevailing in capital and country after the tremendous changes of the Revolution.\\"Allinson, Alfred. The Days of the Directoire, London, John Lane, 1910, p. vii. Significance Allinson's primary importance to literature is in helping to introduce French authors Alexandre Dumas and Anatole France to a broad English audience. Several of his translations of their works were the first into English, and a number of these remain the only English versions. In the case of Anatole France, his were the English versions authorised by the original writer.

A copy, without the attribution to Wilde, is at: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044013686464;view=1up;seq=13 . Experts on Petronius have doubted the attribution and, when challenged, Carrington could not produce any part of the manuscript. Experts on Wilde are more emphatic that Wilde did not write it, as the English falls far below Wilde's standards, the work was unknown to those who were close to Wilde and was especially unlikely to have been done in his last years in Paris, and the family and literary executor of Oscar Wilde demanded that Carrington cease attributing the book to him; at this point (ca. 1909) Carrington issued a grudging retraction that it had \\"been attributed quite erroneously to the pen of Oscar Wilde\\". The underlying text is very inferior, e.g. it incorporates the passages forged by Nodot. The bibliography is also disappointing, and the introduction errs in assigning the 1736 translation by John Addison to the better-known Joseph Addison who died in 1719. In 1930, ten years after Carrington's death, the Panurge Press, in New York, republished this translation, with its introduction (but not its bibliography, forward, or footnotes) with Alfred R. Allinson identified as the translator and author of the introduction. The translation itself hints that the translator was working from French renderings of Satyricon, more than from the original Latin.

Rule The rule of VƒÅsishka in the area of Punjab is attested by inscriptions, as well as in the area of Mathura (Isapur inscription). His rule is recorded as far south as Sanchi, where one and possibly another inscription in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (The Sanchi inscription of \\"Vaskushana\\"-i.e. Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (The Sanchi inscription of Vasaska-i.e. Vasishka) of a Kushan era (widely thought to be the second century of the Kanishka era). This would place his reign c. 247‚Äì265. Inscriptions and statuary Vasishka appears in four known inscriptions, including a Kharoshti inscription in the Indus region. =Sanchi Bodhisattava= Several statues or statue fragments from the art of Mathura with the name of Vasishka have been found on the site of Sanchi. One of them is a statue of a seated Bodhisattva, dated to \\"Year 28 of Vasishka\\". The inscription reads: =Sanchi pedestal= Another Mathura fragment found in Sanchi is the pedestal of a statue of a standing Buddha. The inscription is inscribed with \\"Year 22 of Vaskushana\\", thought to be possibly \\"Vasishka Kushana\\".\\"He might have begun to rule even two years earlier if he can be identified with king Vaskushana(=Vasishka Kushana?) of a Sanchi record of the year22\\" Worshippers in long tunics with belts typical of the Kushan style can be seen standing around a seated Boddhisattva. The inscription reads: =Ara inscription= VƒÅsishka appears in the \\"Ara inscription\\" of Kanishka III, found in the Indus region, not far south of Attock. In this inscription, he is presented as the father of Kanishka, thought to be Kanishka III,and his name appears in Kharoshthi as \\"Vajeshka\\". =Isapur inscription of Vasishka, Year 24= An inscription in the name of Vasishka in pure Sanskrit in Middle Brahmi script, with his full imperial titles MahƒÅrƒÅjasya rƒÅjƒÅtirƒÅjƒÅsya devaputrasya ShƒÅhe VvƒÅsishkasya (\\"Of the Great King, the King of kings, His Majesty, Shahi Vasishka\\") was found in Isapur (), near the city of Mathura, on the shaft of a \\"Yupa\\", a sacrificial Brahmanical pillar, now in the Mathura Museum. Coinage Gold Dinar of Vasishka (as Vaskushana). Oesho, probably Shiva, appears on the reverse. Circa CE 240-250 The coinage of Vasishka becames smaller than his predecessors, being minted on increasingly small flans, and the metal quality becoming debased. The deities appearing on the reverse of his coinage are similar to those in the coins of Huvishka and Vasudeva I. Several of VƒÅsishka's coins have been found together with those of the Kushano-Sasanian ruler Ardashir I Kushanshah, suggesting a level of rivalry and interaction between the two rulers. The coins of Vasishka usually have the legend in Greco-Bactrian script √æAONANO√æAO BAZI√æKO KO√æANO \\"King of King Bazeshko Kushano\\". Some coins with a slightly different name (Obverse legend √æAONANO√æAO BAZOŒîŒóO/BOZOŒóO KO√æANO \\"King of King Bazodeo the Kushan\\") have been attributed to \\"Vaskushana\\", generally equaled with Vasishka himself.\\"The coins bearing the legend 'ShaonanoShao Ba-Zodeo/Bozoeo Koshano', ('PAONANOPAO BA- ZOAHO / BOZOHO KOPANO') starts at 1 o'clock have 46 been attributed to Vaskushana (Vasishka) by Gobl.\\" in References * \\"Ancient Indian Inscriptions\\", S.

It was founded on November 1, 1901, at Richmond College (now the University of Richmond), and its national headquarters remains in Richmond, Virginia. It was founded on three principles: Virtue, Diligence, and Brotherly Love (often abbreviated as \\"VDBL\\"). Sigma Phi Epsilon is one of the largest social fraternities in the United States in terms of current undergraduate membership. History Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity House at Ohio University. =Founding= In the fall of 1900 18-year-old divinity student Carter Ashton Jenkens, the son of a Baptist minister, transferred from Rutgers College of New Jersey to Richmond College, a Baptist institution in the Virginia capital. At Rutgers Jenkens had been initiated into the Chi Phi fraternity. At Richmond, which did not have a chapter of Chi Phi, Jenkens was part of group of friends who were meeting regularly under the unofficial name the \\"Saturday Night Club\\". By early October, 1901, Jenkens had persuaded the group, which had grown to twelve men, to try to establish a chapter of Chi Phi at Richmond. These men were reportedly spurned by the existing fraternities on campus for their sense of morality (seven of the twelve were studying for the ordained ministry) and for their rural, middle-class backgrounds. Jenkens had convinced the others that their chapter could be different from the other fraternities on campus and assured them that Chi Phi's principles were in line with their own. The group's request for a charter, however, was met with refusal as the national fraternity felt that Richmond College was too small to host a Chi Phi chapter. Jenkens and his friends therefore founded their own fraternity. After several secret meetings throughout October 1901, the new fraternity took shape and on November 1, 1901, the fraternity's first membership roster was publicly posted at the school. It listed the twelve founding members in this order: Carter Ashton Jenkens, Benjamin Donald Gaw, William Hugh Carter, William Andrew Wallace, Thomas Temple Wright, William Lazelle Phillips, Lucian Baum Cox, Richard Spurgeon Owens, Edgar Lee Allen, Robert Alfred McFarland, Franklin Webb Kerfoot and Thomas Vaden McCaul. After much discussion, the group settled on a secret motto and called their fraternity Sigma Phi. Jenkens, Gaw and Phillips then met with a faculty committee to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as more than half the members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name Sigma Phi. The founders responded that their new fraternity would be different from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles, and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate. With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon. =Badge and colors= The colors dark red and royal purple were chosen to represent fraternity, while the golden heart was chosen as the fraternity's symbol. The principles of Virtue, Diligence and Brotherly Love, were chosen as \\"The Three Cardinal Principles\\". Jenkens also designed the fraternity's badge as a golden heart surmounted by a black enameled heart-shaped shield. Upon the shield are inscribed, in gold, the Greek-letters of the fraternity, Œ£Œ¶Œï, and below these letters, a skull and crossbones. The meaning of these symbols is divulged during the initiation ritual and known to members only. The founders' badges were designed and ordered before the addition of \\"Epsilon\\" to the fraternity's name. Thus they had only a \\"Sigma\\" and a \\"Phi\\" inscribed on the lobes of the heart, with the skull and crossbones below. A last-minute telegraph sent to the jeweler requested that an \\"Epsilon\\" be added \\"somewhere\\" on the already- complete badges, so the jeweler replaced the bottom-most gemstones with a black enameled \\"Epsilon.\\" The badges of founders Carter and McCaul are on display at the Sigma Phi Epsilon headquarters at the fraternity's headquarters. Chapter house doors are traditionally painted red. The tradition of the red door on Sigma Phi Epsilon Chapter houses began at Syracuse University (New York Alpha) in the 1920s. Brothers there painted the front door of their house red as a token of fraternalism, because it is a fraternity color. Today, all 260 SigEp chapters have red doors. =Acceptance of transgender members= In December 2014, Sigma Phi Epsilon became the first fraternity in the North American Interfraternity Conference to accept transgender men as members. The National Board of Directors passed the policy by an 8-0 majority vote with three abstentions. Controversies In January 2020, the chapter at Lamar University was shut down by the fraternity's national board of directors after hazing was reported to the university's leadership.https://kfdm.com/news/local/breaking-lu-says-it-suspends-sigep- chapter-national-office-closes-it In September 2019, the chapter at the University of Nebraska Omaha was shut down by the fraternity's national board of directors due to multiple fraternal code violations.https://www.ketv.com/article/fraternity-sigma-phi-epsilon-closes- uno-chapter-due-to-investigation/29366692 In 2018, the chapter at Dartmouth College was shut down by the fraternity's national board of directors due to multiple fraternal code violations.https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2018/10/sigma-phi-epsilon- closes-following-charter-revocation In 2017, the chapter at Auburn University was shut down after several serious allegations were made public about the behaviors of the chapter. As a result, the national office initiated a thorough investigation into the chapter which determined it was guilty of hazing, illicit drug use, and alcohol violations.http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2017/11/sigma-phi-epsilon- revokes-auburn-chapters-charter-closes-fraternity In October 2016, the chapter at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison was shut down after repeated alcohol and safety violations. The fraternity was consistently cited for providing alcohol to underage students when hosting parties at their fraternity house.http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/uw-madison- sigma-phi-epsilon-fraternity-terminated-for-alcohol- violations/article_30dfc12e-e0ee-5b71-a6f6-620d715b2c0b.html In August 2016, member Dan Drill was sentenced to 74 months in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of rape. In March 2016, the chapter at Purdue University was placed on suspension until 2020 for brutal hazing, alcohol violations, and non- compliance with university rules.http://college.usatoday.com/2016/03/23/purdue-sigma-phi-epsilon- suspended/ In September 2015, a Sigma Phi Epsilon member at the West Virginia University (WVU) was arrested for allegedly raping a WVU female student at the fraternity's chapterhouse. He faces up to 25 years of prison for the felony charge. In October 2015, Sigma Phi Epsilon revoked the charter of the Jacksonville State University chapter due to hazing and other alleged actions including racism and sexual misconduct. The chapter was ordered to cease operations for three years and remove itself off-campus if the chapter was to be re-activated. In November 2014, all fraternity activity was suspended at San Diego State University after SigEp members harassed protestors at an anti- rape rally on campus by throwing eggs, shouting obscenities, and waving dildos at them with other members of fraternities on fraternity row.https://www.rawstory.com/2014/11/sdsu-suspends-all-frat-activities-after- members-wave-dildos-throw-eggs-at-rape-protesters/ In September 2014, Tucker Hipps, of Clemson University located in Clemson, South Carolina was found dead in Lake Hartwell after his pledge brothers reported him missing after a run that morning. Both the university and the national fraternity found that the chapter had violated its code of conduct. The investigation is ongoing. In February 2015, Clemson chapter was given a five-year suspension for alleged violations of the student organization conduct code after the death of Hipps. In February 2014, two sexual assaults were reported at the Yale University SigEp chapter fraternity house one block from campus. The fraternity released a statement stating they had allowed their facility to be used by another student group for a private event. According to the fraternity, the allegations were not made against members of the chapter. In January 2014, 178 grams of marijuana and .21 grams of cocaine were seized from the fraternity house at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One fraternity member was arrested and charged for drug possession and intent to sell. In 2014, the Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter of the University of Mississippi was closed after three of its members were found guilty of draping a noose around the statue of James Meredith, the first black student to attend the university. A thorough investigation of the chapter also uncovered the fraternity was guilty of brutally hazing pledges and providing alcohol to underage students.http://www.campussafetymagazine.com/article/sigma_phi_epsilon_closes_ole_miss_chapter/Alcohol_Enforcement In 2013, the fraternity was suspended for two years at Southern Methodist University after torturing a Hispanic fraternity member of Lambda Chi Alpha for four hours. Four Sigma Phi Epsilon members were arrested and charged with assault for kicking, punching, spraying Formula 409 on wounds and cuts, making racist comments, and holding the Lambda Chi Alpha member captive against his will. In December 2011, the chapter at the University of Vermont was suspended and heavily criticized for circulating a survey that asked fraternity members \\"If I could rape someone, who would it be?\\" Feminist groups on campus fought to have the fraternity permanently removed from campus for preying on women and encouraging sexual assault.http://jezebel.com/5867922/frat-suspended- after-distributing-rapey-survey-to-members In August 2011, the National Board of Directors of Sigma Phi Epsilon voted to support criminal prosecution of anyone hazing members. In 2011, three Sigma Phi Epsilon members from East Carolina University were arrested and charged with several offenses for possession of 49 grams of marijuana, three Adderall pills, and a dozen stolen street signs at their fraternity house. In 2010, the fraternity at Florida Atlantic University was suspended after sending a pledge to the hospital. Pledges were \\"kidnapped\\" during a prank and their hands and feet were bound with duct tape. They were forced to chug beer and liquor out of a bowl and was sprayed with a squirt gun and colored on with markers. No pledge decided to press charges against members of the fraternity for hazing violations.http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-01-12/news/fl-fau-frat- suspension-20100112_1_hazing-incident-sigma-phi-epsilon-fraternity In 2007, four members of the fraternity were arrested from Florida State University for hazing after police found 31 pledges shivering in 30 degree weather and covered in raw eggs, catfish-stink bait, flour and vinegar, and their bodies were red with welts.

Ali Imran is the pivotal character, a comical secret agent who controls the Secret Service as X-2 but appears to work as a normal member of the Secret Service. Except for a handful of people, no one knows his status as the chief of the Service. The first book, Khaufnaak Imarat (The Terrifying Building), was published in October 1955. In early books Imran appears as a solo detective, but later in the ninth book, Dhuaen ki Tehreer (The Scribbling in Smoke), he is portrayed as the chief of Secret Service as X-2. Humour is the essence of Ibn-e-Safi books. In this series by Mr. Ibn-e-Safi had written a total number of 120 Imran Series books.  Characters of Imran Series  Ali Imran (X-2), Safdar Saeed, Black Zero (Tahir), Juliana Fitzwater (Julia), Amma Bi, Surayya, Fazal Rahman, Sir Sultan, Roshee, Joseph Mugonda, Sulaiman, Captain Fayyaz, Zafar-ul-Mulk, Jameson (Jumman Bafati), Tanveer Ashraf, Captain Jaafari, Captain Khawar, Lieutenant Siddique, Lieutenant Chauhan, Sergeant Nomani, Doctor Dawar, Shakeel (friend of Ali Imran from Imran Series novel 15 Kaly Chiragh), Sualeha friend of Surayya(Daughter of Doctor Dawood Director General from Institute of Scientific Research from Imran Sereis Novel 48 Doosri Aankh) Many writers have written on the famous characters of Ibn-e- Safi and have included their own characters in Imran Series and Jasoosi Dunya (Fareedi Hameed Series). Secret Service Members Original author Ibn-e-Safi used the Secret Service as a central focus of the Imran Series. Later authors, continuing the series, added new members of the Secret Service. Real-world locations are not used in the series, instead fictional countries and place names are used. = Ali Imran = Ali Imran is a pivotal character and gives the series its name. He is handsome and bright, holding M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Oxford University, and has extraordinary sex appeal. He camouflages himself as a buffoon and never reveals his true nature. He often dresses eccentrically: his typical outfit is a pink coat, a light green shirt, a yellow necktie, white pants, and a purple flat hat with a red rose in it. Ibn-e-Safi refers to this as Imran's ‚ÄúTechnicolor Outfit.‚Äù Imran is the son of Karam Rehman (Rahman Sahib), Director General of the Central Intelligence Bureau. He claims descent from Genghis Khan, and has Mongol ancestry. Imran mother's real name is never revealed, she is referred to as Amma Bi. Imran lives in an apartment with his two most trusted assistants: Sulaiman, the cook, and Joseph Mugunda, his bodyguard from Africa. He usually drives a two- seater sports car. Imran purposefully maintains multiple facets to his personality. As Ali Imran, he acts as an opportunist who may turn either a police informer or a blackmailer as the situation demands. He is also the chief of the Secret Services, called X-2. Only three other characters know his secret: Sir Sultan, Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Black Zero, who acts as X-2 in Imran's absence; and Roshee, a long time friend and trusted partner. Imran also occasionally assumes the personae of the Prince of Dhump, a warlord of a fictitious state known as Dhump, and of Rana Tahavvar Al Sandooqui, a wealthy landlord and businessman. Early in the series Imran is portrayed as a hired agent of the Secret Service. Later he becomes a regular member of the agency. The other agents are not aware that he is their chief officer. As Imran, they laugh and sneer at him, but as X-2 they dread him. Imran learned the art of dodging bullets, called \\"Sing Art,\\" from an international Chinese criminal, Sing Hee.Ibne Safi, Lashoan Ka Bazaar, # 12, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1956 Imran calls him Uncle Sing (Chcha Sing - ⁄Ü⁄Üÿß ÿ≥ŸÜ⁄Ø) and, in return, Sing Hee refers him as nephew. An old time foe who becomes enamored of him is Theresia Bumblebee of Bohemia, T3B.Ibne Safi, Kaalay Charaagh, # 15, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1956 (First appearance of Theresia) Imran has no interest in women, and appears asexual. =Tahir or Black Zero= Tahir is portrayed as perhaps the most important member of the secret service. He knows that Imran is X-2 and plays the role of X-2 in Imran's absence. In Darindon Ki Basti Imran realizes that his coworkers, mainly Juliana Fitzwater, are beginning to suspect that he is X-2. To permanently remove their suspicions, he decides to induct another member, codenamed \\"Black Zero\\" into the Secret Service. However, the original Black Zero is killed.Ibne Safi, Darandoan Ki Basti, # 18, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1957 Imran therefore appoints Tahir to the job and assigns him the Black Zero codename. The members of the secret service know him only as Mr. Tahir, the caretaker of Rana Palace. Black Zero is Imran's favorite subordinate, but none of the members of Secret Service know about his true identity. He can replicate X-2's deep, hoarse voice to give orders to Secret Service agents when Imran is not available. =Juliana Fitzwater (Julia)= Juliana Fitzwater is the second in command, or deputy chief, of the Secret Service. She is a beautiful Swiss girl. Before Imran had joined the Secret Service in his Ali Imran persona, Julia was both fascinated by and afraid of her Chief, X-2. However, when Imran joins the Secret Service, Julia becomes attracted to him instead. Julia becomes suspicious that Imran is X-2, and confronts him; Imran is shocked but manages to cover his identity with the help of Black Zero. =Safdar Saeed= Safdar is Imran's most active and most trusted field partner. Safdar never questions Imran's authority: he is a man of action not words. Safdar is the only field agent, apart from Imran, who is not attracted by Julia. He is also the only Secret Service agent who is fluent in Shikrali (a language spoken in the tribal area of Shikral). Safdar Saeed is the most prominent, respectful, and loyal agent after Tahir, and Imran relies heavily on him. Safdar respects Imran greatly. =Tanveer Ashraf= Tanveer loves Julia, but Julia loves Imran. Tanveer is the only member of the Secret Service who is jealous of Imran. His jealousy towards Imran often gets in the way of his duty. Tanveer's primary weakness is that he lacks patience and is very emotional. He is the most trouble-making member of the Secret Service. He has, on many occasions, received either warnings or punishment from X-2 for his negligence of duty. Despite his jealousy of Imran, on he has on many occasions proven his worth. Before he joined the Secret Service he was in military intelligence, and is fond of direct action. In the book Farishtay ka Dushman, he faces a motorbike accident in the line of dutyIbne Safi, Farishtay Ka Dushman, # 90, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1976 and is left permanently unable to carry on with field work. He is transferred to another department and is replaced in the Secret Service by Sergeant Nemo.Ibne Safi Be-charah Shahzor, # 91, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1976 =Zafar-ul-Mulk and Jameson (Jumman Bafati)= Zafar-ul-Mulk and Jumman Bafati were introduced in Taboot Mein Cheekh. Zafar-ul-Mulk is the nephew of Nawab Muzaffarul Mulk.Ibne Safi, Taboot Main Cheekh, # 51, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1968 He was sent to London for his education with his servant Jumman Bafati, earning a Master's degree in Chemistry from Oxford University. During this period Bafati is renamed Jameson. On his return, his uncle becomes annoyed with his modern ideas and asks him, and Jameson, to leave home. By chance they become involved in a case and Imran discovers their strengths. They are invited to join the Secret Service. Zafar-ul-Mulk has similar physical characteristics to Imran, and Imran sometimes disguises Zafar-ul-Mulk as himself. = Captain Khawar= An active member of the group four stars and also works for the secret service. =Lieutenant Siddique= An active member of the group four stars and also works for the secret service. =Lieutenant Chohan= An active member of the group four stars and also works for the secret service. =Sergeant Nomani = An active member of the group four stars and also works for the secret service. =Captain Jaafri and Sergeant Nashad= Captain Jaafari and Sargeant Nashad are incompetent Secret Service agents. They were expelled from the Service due to negligence on duty in \\"Darindon ki Basti\\", Al Fansay (Al Fanse).Ibne Safi, Alphansay, # 17, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1957  Other main characters  =Abdur Rahman= Abdur Rahman (Fazal Rahman) is the father of Ali Imran who is Director-General of the Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB). He is a very strict person both at home and in the office. =Amma Bi= Imran's mother, Amma Bi, is an eastern style housewife. She is a casualty of the severe idea of her better half, Rahman Sahib. She doesn't need Imran to go out, yet is powerless to do anything as a result of her better half. At whatever point Imran visits her, she beats him with her shoes. =Surya= Imran‚Äôs younger sister Surya is blessed with the strict nature of her father. She is also fed up with Imran‚Äôs unserious behavior and lets no opportunity slide to show her anger towards her brother. =Sir Sultan= Sir Sultan is the administrator of the Secret Service, and one of the few characters who can identify Imran as X-2. Imran reports directly to him. He is both irritated at times by Imran's behavior and appreciative of his talents. He has even wished that Imran had been his son.Ibne Safi, Talash-e Gumshudah, # 109, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1979 He is an old friend of Imran's father. Sir Sultan is the Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs. In the novel Raat Ka Shehzaada, Imran helps Sir Sultan by solving a case; in return he is offered a permanent position in the Secret Service.Ibne Safi, Raat Ka Shehzada, # 8, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1956 =Roshee= Roshee is an Anglo-Burmese girl who was saved by Imran before he became X-2.Ibne Safi, Bhayanak Aadmi, # 4, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1956 Intelligent and confident, she has helped Imran in many cases. Imran trusts her, and she has known that he is X-2 since he took on this role. Roshee's father was a businessman in Singapore. During WWII, he lost his business and Roshee became a call girl. After meeting Imran in Bhayanak Aadmi, she becomes ashamed of her profession and Imran offers her a job in the Central Intelligence Bureau. Later, she and Imran open a private investigation agency, \\"Roshee & Co. Forwarding & Clearing Agents\\".Ibne Safi, Jahanam Ki Raqasa, # 5, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1956 She stops working for Imran in Larkiyoan Ka Jazeera, although Imran continues to involve her in cases. =Joseph Mugonda= Joseph Mugonda, an African black man, is Imran's personal bodyguard. He is tall, well-built, and an ex-heavyweight boxing champion. He prefers to dress in a military uniform with holsters on each side, carrying two identical loaded revolvers. In Challees Aik, Baavan, Imran defeats Joseph's boss during a case.Ibne Safi, Challees Aik, Bavan, # 31, Asrar Publications, Karachi, 1958 Joseph's philosophy is that whoever can knock him out he will willingly serve for the rest of his life, and he begins to work for Imran. He is extremely loyal, sometimes referring to Imran as his father. He is a heavy drinker and highly superstitious but is nevertheless a very useful companion. His knowledge of jungles has proved useful on several occasions. He also serves as the Prince of Dhump's bodyguard when Imran assumes this role. Tiger Tiger is not part of X2's team. He is Imran's personal acolyte and aide and his loyalties are all directed to his mentor; he takes issue with anybody challenging Imran. He tries his best to act like his boss. Imran often comments that Tiger does his job to perfection. =Sulaiman= Sulaiman is Imran's cook and housekeeper. Imran and Sulaiman often have comic interactions about the food Sulaiman is going to prepare. Sulaiman was originally employed by Imran's father. He dislikes Imran's bodyguard Joseph, who is always drunk. Later in the series, he marries a girl named Gulrukh. = Super Fayyaz = Super Fayyaz is a friend of Imran's. He is the Superintendent of the Central Intelligence Bureau, under Imran's father Fazal Rehman. Imran occasionally calls him Super Fayyaz. He and Imran have a complex relationship. He consults Imran when in difficulties, but is also jealous of Imran and has several times attempted, unsuccessfully, to arrest him. Fayyaz is not very intelligent, but solves many cases with Imran's help and rises to the position of Superintendent. =Shakeel= Shakeel is a friend of Ali Imran from Imran Series novel 15 Kaly Chiragh by Ibn-e-Safi. =Sualiha= Sualiha, daughter of Doctor Dawood Director-General from Institute of Scientific Research and Sualeha is also a friend of Surya (Imran's sister), from Imran Series Novel 48 Doosri Aank).  Villains  =Sing Hee= Sing Hee is a criminal genius and treacherous villain. As well as appearing in the Imran Series, he also appears in Ibn-e-Safi's series Jasoosi Dunya (The Spy World). Sing was born to a Chinese father and Mongolian mother, and is forced to leave China after a failed coup d'√©tat. Since then he has moved from country to country. He is very thin and appears weak, but is actually very strong. He is nicknamed \\"jonk\\" (leech) because of his ability to squeeze his enemies until they lose consciousness. Imran first meets Sing Hee in London, where Imran is conducting research in criminology, in the book Lashoan Ka Bazaar. A criminal named McLawrence has terrorized the city. Imran investigates, and comes across Sing Hee. Sing has devised a technique that allows him to dodge any bullets fired on him by judging the hand movements of the assailant, and moving swiftly. Sing Hee uses this technique in front of Imran, and Imran asks him to do it again. That is enough for Imran to learn the technique. Imran then surprises Sing Hee by challenging him to shoot at him; Sing Hee fails to hit him, and despite the fact that they are enemies he declares Imran his nephew in terms of cunning. Sing Hee's next appearance is in Joank Ki Wapsee, in a story line that continues in Zehreeli Tasweer and Baebaakon Ki Talaash. Sing Hee is working for an international criminal organization, Zeroland.

Retrieved February 26, 2007. The book was released by Canongate Books in the US and the UK and published by HarperCollins in Canada. The title is a play on \\"Rorschach Tests\\", which are inkblot tests. The novel is a work of Meta-fiction which uses Concrete poetry, linguistic jokes and cultural references. It is the story of an amnesiac re-discovering his past life through a surreal collection of clues he has left himself while evading a steampunk villain and the shark of the title.  Plot summary Eric Sanderson wakes up with no memory of who he is or any past experiences. He is told by a psychologist that he has a dissociative condition known as fugue but a trail of written clues purporting to be from his pre-amnesiac self describe a more fantastic and sinister explanation for his lack of memories. According to these, he has activated a conceptual shark called a Ludovician which \\"feeds on human memories and the intrinsic sense of self\\" and is relentlessly pursuing him and will eventually erase his personality completely. When the Ludovician attacks Eric Sanderson, he decides to go in search of a doctor named Trey Fidorous, identified by the letters from his previous self, in the hope he may be able to help to explain what happened to him and how to defeat the shark. Eric travels through Britain in search of clues and is contacted by a mysterious figure called Mr. Nobody, who is part of a megalomaniac network intelligence called Mycroft Ward. Mr. Nobody attempts to subdue and control Eric but Eric manages to escape with the help of an associate of Fidorous named Scout. Scout takes Eric to meet Fidorous, travelling through un-space (an underground network of empty warehouses and unused cellars). They begin a romantic relationship during the journey but Eric feels betrayed when he discovers that Scout has brought him to Fidorous to use him as bait for the shark in the hope of destroying Ward. With their help Fidorous builds a conceptual shark-hunting boat and they sail out on a conceptual ocean. After a battle with the shark they throw a laptop hooked up to the Mycroft Ward database into its mouth, destroying both Ward and the shark. Eric and Scout remain in the conceptual universe while Eric's dead body is discovered back in the real world. Themes and cultural references =Jaws= The plot of Jaws is referenced extensively and fully acknowledged by the characters in the book, who view it through the device of the conceptual becoming real. The climax of the novel follows the events in the film in detail, highlighting the sense of determinism and post-modern self-awareness. =Kung Fu= There is a passage which draws on the traditional legend of the all-powerful martial arts master defeating better armed and more numerous opponents, in which writing the characters for various fighting forms defeats the opponents using the forms themselves. =Casablanca= A postcard with a still from the film Casablanca is received by Dr Randle from an (apparently) deceased Eric Sanderson. The author has described Casablanca as his favourite love story. Visual style The book uses different typographical sizes and structures to create pictures as a literal way of highlighting the cross-over between the objective reality and its description. Several pages form a flip book animation of a shark attack made out of text. The author has stated that he was interested in \\"text imagery\\" and \\"exploring ideas about language and the evolution of ideas and language in a visual sense\\". Negatives or un- chapters The Raw Shark Texts consists of 36 core chapters bound into the novel itself, and an additional 36 \\"lost\\" sections, known as \\"negatives\\" or \\"un-chapters\\" which exist outside of the main printed text.http://forums.steven-hall.org/yaf_postst52_What-are--Raw-Shark-Texts- Negatives.aspx These extra 'un-chapters' (also written by Steven Hall) have been found periodically since the book's initial release, hidden either online or in the real world.

Characters ;Eric Sanderson: Eric narrates the story. Before losing his memory, Eric's partner, Clio Aames is killed in a scuba diving accident. According to the accounts from his previous self, he attempted to use the conceptual shark to create a conceptual version of Clio from his memories of her but that it had caused him to lose his memory and sense of identity. The \\"2nd Eric Sanderson\\", post-amnesia, is lost and confused, unable to get a handle on who he is or what is real. ;Scout: Scout is described as a young woman who has been damaged by the powerful Mycroft Ward. Her relationship with Eric develops from his rescuer and guide to romantic partner complicated by the fact that she has ulterior motives for seeking him out. The connection between her and Clio is ambiguous: they have an identical tattoo and the damage by Ward appears similar to Clio's cancer. ;Dr. Trey Fidorous One of two characters to know Sanderson both before and after his amnesia, Fidorous is described as an archetypal eccentric academic who is the definitive expert on the pseudo-scientific world that conceptual sharks and Mycroft Ward inhabit. ;Clio Aames: Clio Aames is the first Eric Sanderson's girlfriend, revealed only in the text through various letters and fragments. ;Ian the cat: A large cat of unfriendly temperament, who belongs to Sanderson before his amnesia and accompanies him on his journey afterwards. ;Mycroft Ward: Described as a 19th-century alchemist who, in his search for immortality, manages to download his personality into other people. In the present of the narrative Ward is seen as an internet based network of linked intelligences with the single-minded purpose of self-preservation through absorbing people's personalities. ;Dr. Randle: Dr. Randle is a retired doctor, presumably of psychology who counsels Sanderson on his condition. ;Mr. Nobody: An agent of Mycroft Ward who attempts to trap Sanderson.

The song was released on the iTunes Store on April 20, 2007 and was made permanently available for sale on April 24, 2007. It debuted and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, but unlike her previous singles, it encountered radio resistance. Despite its poor radio airplay, the song logged an impressive number of over 100,000 paid digital downloads in its first week on the charts.\\"Kelly Clarkson Apologizes to Clive Davis\\". FOXNews.com. Retrieved July 24, 2007. As of May 2010, the song has sold over one million digital downloads. Clarkson confirmed \\"Sober\\" as the second single from My December on her journal in the Official Kelly Clarkson Fan Club. The song was released to airwaves on June 6, 2007. Industry experts stated that \\"Sober\\" was a crucial single for Clarkson, as the lead single from My December, \\"Never Again\\", charted well due to strong digital downloads but encountered radio airplay resistance in a number of US markets, especially when compared to the radio success of all five of her singles from her previous album Breakaway. \\"Never Again\\" had been descending in radio airplay after failing to break the top 20 on the Pop format, and therefore was one reason why \\"Sober\\" was released so soon after \\"Never Again\\" (just over five weeks later, and three weeks before the release of the album). Whether radio accepted \\"Sober\\" was considered key in determining the sales potential of My December. After the failure of the song (Clarkson's least successful single in the US to date), sales of the My December album in the US largely ceased, and no further US singles from the album were released. However, in an interview with Nashville radio station 107.5 The River, Clarkson said that she released \\"Sober\\" so early because she wanted to show the diversity of music in My December. In July 2007, \\"Sober\\" was a highlight of Clarkson's five-song set at Live Earth at Giants Stadium, with the audience audibly applauding her vocal line during the song's climax near the end. It has also been considered as a fan favorite from the album. \\"Sober\\" did have a featured spot in Clarkson's My December Tour, being played at the start of the encores and receiving a strong audience response. No music video was made for the song. \\"One Minute\\" managed to gain airplay in Australia, which led the label to officially release it as the second single there. A CD single was released on September 22, 2007.New Single! However, it ultimately failed to make a major dent in Australia, debuting at number 36 on the charts before quickly exiting. \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" was released as the third and final single. It was released in several European countries via iTunes in November 2007. It was released as a CD single in Germany in December 2007. It was also released in Australia in February 2008. A music video was released to promote the song and combined real-life images and computer animated graphics. Critical reception The first single, \\"Never Again\\", was released on April 13, 2007 in the US, and despite debuting in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to strong digital sales, it never achieved substantial airplay and was pulled from many stations only a couple of weeks following its release. Otherwise, the album opened successfully; its opening week sales comparable to those of Clarkson's first two albums. It was suggested that so much controversy would have hindered the sales of Clarkson's then-new album. M. Tye Corner of AOL Music had opined early on that the controversy could \\"affect sales a bit in the first few weeks and when the record c[ame] out.\\" In spite of the controversy surrounding My December, the album garnered fairly positive reviews from music professionals and critics.Nekesa Mumbi Moody, \\"Drama Accompanies New Clarkson Album\\", Associated Press (The Washington Post), June 27, 2007. The album scored 64/100 on Metacritic, indicating generally positive reviews. Slant Magazine reviewed My December mostly positive, with the album receiving a 3.5/5 star review. An excerpt from the review, in response to the disappointing performance of \\"Never Again\\", read: \\"But who cares about hits‚Äîor appeasing the kids‚Äîwhen the songs are this good?\\" The Times wrote: \\"Clarkson has the moxie to rock without worrying about what anybody else thinks... Her gift is finding the source of vitality in absolute mainstream, people-pleasing pop, which by its nature breaks stylistic rules in favor of magpie mash-ups, bold appropriations and happy accidents.\\"Kelly Clarkson Releases Album #3 'My December' This Saturday posted June 20, 2007 AllMusic, however, gave a more lukewarm review, giving it 3/5 stars, saying: \\"It's what Kelly wanted to do, so on that level it's a success, and one that listeners who share her viewpoint (and quite likely her age) will respond to but for everybody else, My December is a disappointment.\\" Commenting on Clarkson's feud with her record label, they also claimed: \\"My December proves that both camps were correct: Davis is correct that there are no big crossover hits here, yet it's also true that this is an artistic move that Clarkson needed to make. If left up to Davis, she would simply be another vocalist singing professional product.\\" Rolling Stone, giving a similar lukewarm review, wrote: \\"Clarkson clobbers you over the head with her emotions and arena-ready choruses. The result is a record that's bland in some spots and annoying in others.\\" Legacy A 2016 article from Sputnikmusic described My December as \\"the most logical progression for Kelly's career\\"; noting the album's genre-hopping between pop, pop punk, alternative rock, hard rock, soul, R&B;, and folk without one genre sounding out of place, and further noting that \\"it would be really interesting to see if she ever makes an album like My December again\\". A 2017 article from AXS commemorating the ten-year anniversary of My December stated that \\"from My December was an album Clarkson made for herself and taught her more about not only herself but when to stand up for what she believes in. \\"It's my face, it's my time,\\" she said of the record. During the feud, other artists jumped to her defense including Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates who also had a conflict with Davis during their run. To date, it still remains a favorite of fans.\\" Commercial performance My December, in its debut, not only was one of the best selling albums of the week, but sold faster than Clarkson's previous album, Breakaway (which peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart).

The program focuses on teaching members medical skills that can be applied inside and outside of scouting events. The program is for youth, male and female, ages 15 to 26. Program =Program sections= Medical Venturers include members from two program sections: * Venturers ages 15 to 17 * Rovers ages 18 to 26 Medical Venturer groups are open to both males and females. The Medical Venturer program was originally conceived as a Venturer program in British Columbia in 1994. The members shortened the name to MedVents. When Rover age youths began to inquire about membership in 2000, the program was expanded to include Rovers. The MedVent program for the Rovers is the same as the program for Venturers. When the existing Medical Venturers became Rovers age, the program faced a challenge of how to keep these members interested and allow them to expand their interest in the program. A decision was made to add a Rover specific MedVent level, call MedVent level IIII. The level first aid requirement for this level is an Emergency Medical Certificate. It also meant the prerequisite for this level would be MedVent level III. All adult volunteers, Scouters, in Venturer or Rover sections are called Advisors. Scouters at this level are in an advisory level and not a leader role. Venturers and Rovers are more involved in the planning of their program than in the younger SCouting sections. As of 2014, there were 25 MedVent groups across Canada. =Camps= Medical Venturers attend camps both as participants, and as Offer of Service (OOS) staff. When attending a camp as staff, they are usually required to be ready to provide first aid anywhere in the camp with just a few moments notice. Medical Venturers also attend camps that are geared solely towards training. Groups are typically split up and shuffled. This forces individuals to learn how to work in a team effectively, and increases the level of challenge. Individuals both learn and teach skills that they have acquired while in these groups. MedVents have been active in Canadian Jamboree National MASH units. Medvents, join Paramedics, Nurse, Physicians and provide medical care and support to campers. * 2001: 10th Canadian Scout Jamboree, Cabot Beach Provincial Park, Prince Edward Island. Approximately 40 Medvents/ Rovers * 2007: 11th Canadian Scout Jamboree, Tamaracouta Scout Reserve, Quebec. - Approximately 100 Medvents * 2013: 12th Canadian Scout Jamboree, Camp Woods, Sylvan Lake, Alberta. - * 2017: 13th Canadian Scout Jamboree, Camp Nedooae, Nova Scotia - =Service= In addition to providing first aid service to Scouting and public events, many groups are expected to assist their EMS sponsors in providing volunteer assistance when paramedics are involved in charitable events. =Uniforms= There is no standard MedVents uniform. There is however a de facto \\"program activity\\" uniform. MedVent groups wear a uniform that is agreed upon by the group, Scouts Canada and their sponsor. MedVent groups without a signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Scouts Canada and their sponsor wear the standard Scouts Canada uniform or the MedVent shirt without the Scouts Canada strip. In this case, a Canadian flag is worn in place of the strip. MedVent groups who have signed the MOU and have received approval from Scouts Canada can wear the MedVent \\"program activity\\" uniform with a navy blue Scouts Canada strip. The strip is worn above the shirt's left pocket flap. The program activity uniform shirt consists of a navy blue military style shirt with either a navy blue Scouts Canada bar or a Canadian flag over the left breast pocket. The purple World Scouting Badge is worn above this. In some groups the sponsor's or partner's logo is worn on the right breast above the pocket. Any award ribbons are worn above the right breast pocket and below the sponsor crest. MedVents wear a distinctive epaulette (light blue for Venturers, red for Rovers and navy for non-section advisors) indicating their medical skill and experience level denoted by one to four bars, and is worn on the shoulders. Section advisors wear the same colour epaulettes as their youth section. Group shoulder flashes are also placed on the sleeves. An agency badge (Red Cross, St John Ambulance, etc.) is worn on the right sleeve. A member's first aid certification can identified by the agency's certification crest and not by the number of stripes on their epaulettes. Not all groups wear an agency crest. In some groups the stripes indicate their training level. At issue with the agency crest for the wilderness first aid certification which does not exist. At the MedVent round table meeting held on January 7, 2012, a motion was put forward and accepted that all advisors would switch to wearing the navy blue (non-section) epaulettes. The switch over is expected to be completed by now. With Scouts Canada eliminating epaulettes on their uniforms MedVents groups with new recruits without a first aid certification does not wear epaulettes. The Scouts Canada epaulettes was worn by new members to indicate that they do not have a certification level. A possible solution is to create an epaulette without stripes. Some groups in BC wear the Council Badge on the left sleeve with the Agency Badge (Red Cross, etc.) worn below. On the right sleeve is a Scouts Canada Medical Program Badge. This badge has a white background with yellow trim. It is rounded at the top and flat on the bottom. It contains the star of life in blue and the Fleur-de-lis in yellow. Around the top in blue writing is \\"Scouts Canada\\" and along the bottom in blue is \\"Medical Program\\". Below this badge are specific qualification badges (basic, advanced, nurse, paramedic, search and rescue, pilot, etc.) depending on professional qualifications or medvent qualifications. Above the main badge is a group flasher indicating what group the wearer belongs to. Epaulettes worn are blue and have the star of life in the centre with the medical qualification on the ends. This allows a MedVent to hold a basic or intermediate level (indicated on the sleeve), but hold a First Responder Certificate indicated on the epaulette. This avoids any confusion with the bars. Navy blue paramedic pants (with reflective stripe) are also worn with a black web belt along with black safety shoes. A group necker is worn by all groups for Scouting events and ceremonies. A necker is never worn during service. A scissors kit with trauma shears and penlight is also normally worn. MedVents who are trained to take blood pressures will carry a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (BP cuff). =Medical Training= MedVents (Medical Venturers and Rovers) is a Vocational Scouting Program. Most MedVent groups follow the Canadian Red Cross system for their training requirement. Some group deviate from the Canadian Red Cross system when local training is not available. A standard first aid/CPR/AED certification is sometimes required as a prerequisite to joining a MedVent group. Some groups have their own certified first aid instructors and a standard certificate is granted after the new member has successfully completed the course. All MedVents must maintain a First Aid certificate to remain in good standing with the group. The minimum certificate is a standard first aid certificate from a recognized organization acceptable to the MedVent group. For uniformity purposes, MedVent groups may only accept specific training certificates. The members that join a group with a valid first aid certificate may have their skills evaluated prior to be given full service status. This is to ensure their skill levels meet the group's requirements and standards. The majority of the MedVent Advisors are also trained first aid. Some Advisors choose to be Scouters and choose not to be trained in first aid. Advisors/Scouters trained in first aid will wear epaulettes with stripes, designating their experience level. Epaulettes without strips are worn when an Advisor is new or they are part of the group as Scouters. The MedVent Level signifies a members training and experience. A MedVent level does not exactly equate to a members certification levels. For example, a new member with a First Responder (FR) certificate will still be required to meet the other requirements of a specific level before being issued that level's epaulette. In other words, a member with an FR certificate may wear a Level 1 epaulette because he/she has not met the other requirements of a Level 3 MedVent. The member will still operate as an FR during service. MedVents are required annually to volunteer for both non-medical and medial volunteer hours. For most groups the annual non-medical community service requirement is 24 hours. MedVents classify volunteer First Aid volunteer hours to be medical service hours. The number of annual volunteer hours may vary with the MedVent group. Program examples: A member with a Standard First Aid certificate must complete 48 hours volunteer medical service before he/she is awarded the basic level epaulettes (one bar) and certificate. This is an annual requirement of a basic level MedVent (Level 1). At this level, groups may have additional training requirements like radio training and leadership training. For members without Scouting background, some basic Scouting skills training may be required. An intermediate level, involves successful completion of a wilderness first aid survival weekend course and then completion of an additional 72 hours of medical service. The member must also have successfully satisfied the Level 1 requirements. An intermediate certificate and 2 bar epaulettes are then issued to the member. An advanced level member must certify in either First Responder (FR), Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) or International Trauma Life Support (ITLS) courses along with two ambulance ride outs to qualify at that level. The member is then asked to accumulate an additional 96 hours of volunteer medical service to complete his/her advanced qualification. To allow the member to use their training in a large event these members are also required to attend a minimum 5-day Jamboree once every 4 years. The member is then awarded the advanced certificate and the 3 (FR) or 4 (EMR) bar epaulettes. This level usually requires the member to be 18 years of age. In some groups, licensed medical professionals can be issued a set of 4 bar epaulettes. However, some the medical professional who Rovers or Advisors may wear a lower level as they have decided that they wish to go through the program as designed. =Groups= See also * Scouts Canada * Scouting in Canada References Scouting and Guiding in Canada ","title":"Medical Venturers"},{"id":"9758121","text":"An asteroid is a minor planet.

Species of lichens that have been named in Charles Plitt's honor are: Pyrenula plittii R.C.Harris, Xanthoparmelia plittii (Gyelnk) Hale, and Pertusaria plittiana Erichsen. Plitt graduated from Baltimore City College with honors, and in 1891 received the Graduate degree in Pharmacy (Ph. G) from the Maryland College of Pharmacy. In 1921, the degree of Doctor of Science was conferred upon him by the International Academy of Science. He lived in Baltimore, Maryland his entire life. For more than 36 years, Charles Plitt taught botany and general science in the public schools of Baltimore and for his last twenty years at Baltimore City college. During a portion of this time, Plitt served part-time as a member of the research staff of the Maryland College of Pharmacy. Upon becoming chairman of that institution, he gave up teaching in public schools. Beginning in the 1890s, Plitt became an avid collector of plants and lichens. He led Saturday afternoon trips around the Baltimore area to botanize and instruct others interested in plant identification. He called these botanical excursions \\"tramps\\". Plitt kept accurate notes on each of these trips and eventually accumulated enough data to fill 29 volumes. According to The Sun, a Baltimore newspaper, he made 3,153 tramps between 1899 and 1922. (Sipple 1999) These journals are a priceless record of the varied species of plants which once grew in habitats now buried beneath urban landscapes.Charles C. Plitt Collection : NAL Collections : National Agricultural Library Irwin Murray Brodo, a world authority on the identification and biology of lichens, reported that Plitt had a private collection of over 10,000 lichen specimens. This collection was estimated to be the third largest at the time. (Brodo 2000) In 1908, Plitt gave a talk to the Sullivant Moss Society which was meeting in Baltimore, and a year later published an abstract of this talk in The Bryologist. (Plitt 1908) Apparently some of the specimens that he used for that talk were found by Charlie Davis in little glass boxes in the archives of The Natural History Society of Maryland.The Natural History Society of Maryland at www.marylandnature.org See also *Lichens of Maryland References Sipple, Willilam S. 1999.

The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1990. viii-ix. It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender, i.e. her position as a woman within the literary world. Women's writing, as a discrete area of literary studies and practice, is recognized explicitly by the numbers of dedicated journals, organizations, awards, and conferences which focus mainly or exclusively on texts produced by women. Women's writing as an area of study has been developing since the 1970s. The majority of English and American literature programs offer courses on specific aspects of literature by women, and women's writing is generally considered an area of specialization in its own right. Distinct category  Virginia Woolf The broader discussion women's cultural contributions as a separate category has a long history, but the specific study of women's writing as a distinct category of scholarly interest is relatively recent. There are examples in the 18th century of catalogs of women writers, including George Ballard's Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain Who Have Been Celebrated for their Writing or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences (1752); John Duncombe's Feminiad, a catalogue of women writers; and the Biographium faemineum: the female worthies, or, Memoirs of the most illustrious ladies, of all ages and nations, who have been eminently distinguished for their magnanimity, learning, genius, virtue, piety, and other excellent endowments.Todd, Janet, ed. British Women Writers: a critical reference guide. London: Routledge, 1989. xiii. Similarly, women have been treated as a distinct category by various misogynist writings, perhaps best exemplified by Richard Polwhele's The Unsex'd Females, a critique in verse of women writers at the end of the 18th century with a particular focus on Mary Wollstonecraft and her circle. Earlier discussion of women's broader cultural contributions can be found as far back as the 8th century BC, when Hesiod compiled Catalogue of Women (attr.), a list of heroines and goddesses. Plutarch listed heroic and artistic women in his Moralia. In the medieval period, Boccaccio used mythic and biblical women as moral exemplars in De mulieribus claris (On Famous Women) (1361‚Äì1375), directly inspiring Christine de Pisan to write The Book of the City of Ladies (1405). Women writers themselves have long been interested in tracing a \\"woman's tradition\\" in writing. Mary Scott's The Female Advocate: A Poem Occasioned by Reading Mr Duncombe's Feminead (1774) is one of the best known such works in the 18th century, a period that saw a burgeoning of women writers being published. In 1803, Mary Hays published the six volume Female Biography. And, Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own (1929) exemplifies the impulse in the modern period to explore a tradition of women's writing. Woolf, however, sought to explain what she perceived as an absence; and by the mid-century scholarly attention turned to finding and reclaiming \\"lost\\" writers.Buck, Claire, ed.The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature. Prentice Hall, 1992. vix; Salzman, Paul. Introduction, Early Modern Women's Writing. Oxford UP, 2000. ix. There were many to reclaim: it is common for the editors of dictionaries or anthologies of women's writing to refer to the difficulty in choosing from all the available material.Blain et al. vii; Todd xv; Spender, Dale, and Janet Todd. Anthology of British Women Writers. Harper Collins, 1989. xiii; Buck ix-x.Busby, Margaret, ed. Daughters of Africa, Cape, 1992, p. xxx. Trade publishers have similarly focused on women's writing recently: since the 1970s there have been a number of literary periodicals (such as Fireweed and Room of One's Own) which are dedicated for publishing the creative work of women writers, and there are a number of dedicated presses as well, such as the Second Story Press and the Women's Press. In addition, collections and anthologies of women's writing continue to be published by both trade and academic presses. The question of whether there a \\"women's tradition\\" remains vexing; some scholars and editors refer to a \\"women's canon\\" and women's \\"literary lineage,\\" and seek to \\"identify the recurring themes and to trace the evolutionary and interconnecting patterns\\" in women's writing,Spender & Todd xiii. but the range of women's writing across time and place is so considerable that, according to some, it is inaccurate to speak of \\"women's writing\\" in a universal sense: Claire Buck calls \\"women's writing\\" an \\"unstable category.\\"Buck xi. Further, women writers cannot be considered apart from their male contemporaries and the larger literary tradition. Recent scholarship on race, class and sexuality in literature further complicate the issue and militate against the impulse to posit one \\"women's tradition\\". Some scholars, such as Roger Lonsdale, mentions that something of a commonality exists and that \\"it is not unreasonable to consider\\" women writers\\" in some aspects as a special case, given their educational insecurities and the constricted notions of the properly 'feminine' in social and literary behaviour they faced.\\".Lonsdale, Roger ed. Eighteenth-Century Women Poets. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. xiii. Using the term \\"women's writing\\" implies, then, the belief that women in some sense constitute a group, however diverse, who share a position of difference based on gender.  Rediscovering ignored works from the past In the West, the second wave of feminism prompted a general revelation of women's historical contributions, and various academic sub-disciplines, such as women's history and women's writing, developed in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. Much of this early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Studies like Dale Spender's Mothers of the Novel (1986) and Jane Spencer's The Rise of the Woman Novelist (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975, and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels by written by women.Sandra M. Gilbert, \\"Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel.\\" New York Times, May 4, 1986. More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels. There has been commensurate growth in the area of biographical dictionaries of women writers due to a perception, according to one editor, that \\"[m]ost of our women are not represented in the 'standard' reference books in the field.\\"Blain et al. viii. The widespread interest in women's writing developed alongside, and was influenced by, a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literature, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of color, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole-scale expansion of what is considered \\"literature,\\" and genres hitherto not regarded as \\"literary,\\" (such as children's writing, journals, letters, and travel writing, among many others)Blain x; Buck x. are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most genres and sub-genres has undergone a similar analysis, so that one now sees work on the \\"female gothic\\"Term coined by Ellen Moers in Literary Women: The Great Writers (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., The Female Gothic (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., Varieties of Female Gothic, 6 vols (London: Pickering & Chatto, 2002). or women's science fiction, for example. Distinctions In Robert Silverberg's introduction to James Tiptree Jr.‚Äôs \\"The Girl Who Was Plugged In,\\" he expressed the sentiment that the pseudonym must belong to a man, as the syntax and lexicon used in the short story were undeniably masculine. Silverberg compares Tiptree‚Äôs writing to that of Hemingway, saying that the masculinity is found in the fact that the writing was \\"simple, direct and straightforward\\" and uses the style of \\"relying on dialog broken by bursts of stripped down exposition\\". He was later proven to be wrong, as Tiptree is actually Alice Sheldon, a female writer. This raises the question about whether or not male and female writers have definite difference in the way that they write, and if there are certain parameters that define \\"women‚Äôs writing\\". In fact, multiple studies support the fact that there are dissimilarities that exist between the two. = Academic writing = In academic writing, there are marked differences between them in syntax and structure between women's writing and men's writing. =Children = In addition, the article \\"Gender Differences in EFL Writing\\" states that \\"research on gender differences in writing have mostly been conducted among children. Punter and Burchell‚Äôs study (1996) on the GCSE English language exam in the UK primary school discovered that girls scored better in imaginative, reflective, and empathetic writing while boys scored better in argumentative and factual writing\\", which provides evidence for the stance that there is an ingrained difference in the writing of men and women, one that starts very early on in life. This, however, is not the case for everybody, as shown by Alice Sheldon's \\"The Girl Who Was Plugged In,\\" which was believed to be written by a man based on the type of language used. Further evidence for the difference between written word of boys and girls is provided in Written Communication. Analysis of the assignments of eighth graders shows that the girls consistently scored higher on their assignments than the boys, even when the boys showed an increased or above average proclivity towards writing. The article even states that the writing behavior of girls are \\"more desirable\\" in the public school setting. See p. 170. The studies show that when all factors are the same, including learning behavior and attitude, girls are still more successful in writing classes. See p. 176. =Creative writing = These \\"more desirable\\" traits extend on into adulthood, as study in the use of creative or emotional language in adults shows the same results. Examination on the differences in description of color shows that women have greater \\"emotional\\" regards to it. Women generally use more descriptive language than men. Men used less, and are referred to be less \\"emotional\\" overall. There is no correlation between being emotional and age for men, but it is there for women. This supposed ingrained difference between men and women is supported further by the fact that there seems to be no difference in different countries/cultures. \\"Interestingly, such results have been reported across many cultures. Yang (2000) studied male and female Chinese speakers who were undergraduate English majors and found women possessed more color vocabulary (both in English and in Chinese), were more elaborate in the Chinese translations of the color words.\\" While this may have something to do with the supposed superiority of women in identifying shades of color, it also shows that the language they use to describe it is more vivid and detailed with \\"emotionality,\\" and this difference persists throughout races and cultures. See p. 829. = Coding = The stylistic differences between the syntax and lexicon of men and women extends even beyond written communication. In other applications of communication the same rift exists. In computer programming and coding, women are believed to write code that is more user-friendly, containing comments that explain how to use it, and easy to understand variables, while code written by men tends to be cryptic and obscure. Emma McGrattan, a programmer located in Silicon Valley, says she can accurately determine whether code was written by a man or a woman just by looking at it. Women's code may be different than men's, but that does not make it feminist by nature. Feminist code does exist, mainly through the lens of its purpose. The online programming projects WWO and the Orlando project were feminist archive projects meant to collect the works of women throughout history. Women's styles of writing have blended into the digital coding world, and emerged as feminist practices. Jacqueline Wernimont says of the archives, \\"Digital archives unite two historically gendered fields ‚Äî computer and archival sciences. Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification and access. \\"Because men and their ways of addressing literature have been in charge for so long, women have to sort it through the digital archive, which is most important in a feminist sense. The styles of men's writing influence how they have viewed literature as the authority in the field, but women have become more relevant, their styles and strategies of writing have come into the light. \\"Exemplary women\\" tradition *Hesiod, Catalogue of Women (attr.) *Plutarch, in Moralia *Boccaccio, De mulieribus claris (On Famous Women) (1361‚Äì1375) *Christine de Pisan, The Book of the City of Ladies (1405) *Osbern Bokenam, Legendys of hooly wummen (c.1430) *George Ballard, Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain Who Have Been Celebrated for their Writing or Skill in the Learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences.

Toponomy Beguildy is an anglicization of Bugeildy, which means shepherd-house in Welsh, from bugail for shepherd and t≈∑ for house. Community The large, rural community of Beguildy includes the settlements of Beguildy, Felindre, Dutlas, Lloyney, Heyope and Knucklas. It falls in the historic county of Radnorshire. An electoral ward in the same name exists. At the 2011 Census this ward had a population of 1,411. Castle Beguildy Castle is a Norman motte-and-bailey castle of which the well preserved 20 foot high motte and earthworks remain. The village and the castle lie on the border between England and Wales. Church Beguildy Church Medieval screen in Beguildy Church The church, which is mainly 14th century, was restored considerably in the 19th century, with the chancel being rebuilt in 1885 and the nave restored in 1896 (to the design by William Radford Bryden).Scourfield R and Haslam R, (2013) Buildings of Wales: Powys; Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire, 2nd edition, Yale University Press, p. 287-8. The original tower collapsed in the 19th century and bells, which date from 1661 and 1664, were re-hung in their present position in 1936. The church features a 14th-century octagonal font (which reputed to carry marks made by Cromwell's troops sharpening their swords), a holy water stoup at the south door and a priests door in the south wall. The rood screen is a fine example of 15th century workmanship and is well preserved, bearing the original coloured Tudor roses. Probably from the same period are two oak benches. The dug out parish chest, which was reputedly hewn out of a solid block of timber, is an ancient churchwarden's chest and probably dates form the 13th century. At the end of the chest is an iron ring for use when it was drawn by a horse to be buried or hidden in times of trouble. One part of the chest would have held the church valuables and the other the churchwardens treasures. Each compartment was locked separately. The church is well endowed with 20th-century stained glass windows. Associations John Dee has probably been incorrectly associated with Beguildy. He served at the court of Elizabeth I as the royal tutor in mathematics. He later became the Queen's Ambassador to Poland but is remembered as a distinguished early scientist and astronomer. He was reputedly a descendant of Rhodri Mawr, King of Wales.

Back then, it covered a big chunk of southern part of the country, including such cities as Krak√≥w, Jaworzno and Tarn√≥w. Capital city: Krak√≥w. Location and area In early 1939, Voivodeship's area was 17 560 square kilometers. It was located in southern Poland, bordering Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship to the west, Kielce Voivodeship to the north, Lublin Voivodeship, Lw√≥w Voivodeship to the east and Slovakia to the south. Landscape was hilly in the northern part and mountainous in south, with the Tatra Mountains located in the very south of the area. Forests covered 20.9%, with the national average 22.2% (as for January 1, 1937).  Population According to the 1931 Polish census, the population was 2 300 100, with approximately 25% living in towns and cities. Poles were 91.3% of the population, Jews were 5.6%, and Ukrainians were 2.5%. The Jews preferred to live in the cities and towns; in 1931 they made 19.2% of Voivodeship's city inhabitants. Illiteracy (in 1931) was 13.7%, lower than the national average of 23.1%. In early 1939, population density of the province was 130 people per sq. kilometer, which was much higher than Poland's average of 83. Industry Krak√≥w Voivodeship was very divided in industrial terms. Its western part, with such cities as Jaworzno, Chrzan√≥w or Trzebinia, was to a large degree industrialized and urbanized, with some coalmines. Also Krak√≥w and Tarn√≥w were big industrial centers. Eastern part, on the other hand, was backward, with little industry and underdeveloped agriculture. In mid-1930s Polish government started a huge public works program, called Centralny Okrƒôg Przemys≈Çowy (COP), which was a great boost to overpopulated and poor central and eastern counties. The province was unofficially divided into three regions: southern (tourist), western (industrial), and eastern, with its developing industry of the COP. In 1938, the voivodeship was visited by 217,000 tourists. In early 1939, local government began a program of creation of three model tourist villages: Sol in Zywiec County, Tymbark in Limanowa County, and Szymbark in Gorlice County. Furthermore, regulation of the Vistula began in 1938, with levees built along its shores. The road connecting Krak√≥w with Zakopane was to be completed by the end of 1939, after which funds were to be assigned to modernization of the main road from Krak√≥w to Lwow. Due to the outbreak of World War II, none of the projects were finished. Cities and administrative divisions In 1938, it consisted of 18 powiats (counties). These were as follows: * Biala Krakowska county (area 635 km¬≤, population 139 100), * Bochnia county (area 877 km¬≤, population 113 800), * Brzesko county (area 849 km¬≤, population 102 200), * Chrzan√≥w county (area 722 km¬≤, population 138 100), * DƒÖbrowa Tarnowska county (area 650 km¬≤, population 66 700), * Dƒôbica county (area 1 141 km¬≤, population 110 900), * Gorlice county (area 1 082 km¬≤, population 104 800), * Jas≈Ço county (area 1 055 km¬≤, population 116 100), * city of Krak√≥w county (powiat krakowski grodzki), (area 48 km¬≤, population 219 300), * Krak√≥w county (area 884 km¬≤, population 187 500), * Limanowa county (area 944 km¬≤, population 87 300), * Mielec county (area 901 km¬≤, population 77 500), * My≈õlenice county (area 988 km¬≤, population 102 700), * Nowy SƒÖcz county (area 1 572 km¬≤, population 183 900), * Nowy Targ county (area 2 069 km¬≤, population 131 800), * Tarn√≥w county (area 881 km¬≤, population 142 400), * Wadowice county (area 1 109 km¬≤, population 145 100), * ≈ªywiec county (area 1 337 km¬≤, population 130 900).

From a privileged upbringing Thomas was educated at St. Patrick's, Carlow College, a school well noted for turning out many fine Catholic theologians. However his university education at Trinity College, Dublin enabled him to distinguish himself in medicine where he qualified with a BA in 1853, MA in 1854, MB and MD by 1856. During this time Thomas Fitzpatrick also practiced as a doctor in the Co. Cavan village of Mullagh before entering service during 1856 with the British East India Company as an assistant surgeon, an experience which was to leave a lasting impression on him, through his future attitudes towards primitive medicine, magic and religion.

It is also the title of an art-book by Eno and Italian artist Mimmo Paladino, released in 2000, packaged with a copy of the album and featuring pictures & sketches of the Roundhouse Installation. Overview An Opal release, with no catalogue number, this title is only currently available from EnoShop. The music on the album is taken from an Installation‚Äîa show featuring music and visuals‚Äîthat took place at the undercroft of the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, Camden, London, from 9 September to 6 October 1999. The event featured the work of Italian painter, sculptor and set designer Mimmo Paladino, who became established in the early 80's as one of the main exponents of the so-called Transavanguardia, a form of Neo- expressionism and Lyrical Abstraction. This was the second of his exhibitions; the first did not feature Eno's collaboration. His exhibition was in the form of drawings and terracota sculptures - about 30 reclining figures with about 20 attendant crocodiles he called I Dormienti, \\"The Sleepers\\". The publicity notice said of it \\"In the centre of a labyrinth of tunnels, Paladino will create an installation of primordial life forms that will be accompanied by Eno's unique sound and light production\\". In actuality, Eno had nothing to do with the lighting; illumination was provided by the venue's dim emergency lights which imparted a pallor to the sculptures and drawings. The music came from well-concealed speakers and consisted mainly of a three-note Neroli-esque sequence, and electronic noise. In his recent Installations at Bonn and Amsterdam, stories spoken very slowly, one or two words at a time, were used in the performance, and here the method was developed further with treated, sampled voices speaking in syllables - an idea which would be used in his next album, Kite Stories. The material condensed onto the album in a single track consists of ten or so layers of the aforementioned syllables, speech excerpts, the standard Eno treated piano, and various drones and echoes. The book The book was edited by Demetrio Paparoni and published by Alberico Cetti Serbelloni Editore of Milan, in 2000, . Two editions were printed: * A presentation-boxed luxury edition of a print-run of 2000. * A 100-copy special edition accompanied by an aquatint etching with drypoint and presented in a fired terracotta case, both designed by Paladino. It features a five-colour \\"pentachrome\\" printing-process, 250 gram card stock, silk screen printed cloth cover, protective sleeve, monochrome and colour photographs by Peppe Avallone of the Roundhouse exhibition, sketches by Paladino and Eno, a dialogue between the two artists, and the text is in Italian and English. 108 pages, 12 √ó 12 inches.

The male reaches in length, and the female only in the aquarium. In the wild, they reach only in standard length of male and female reaches less than in standard length. This makes them one of the smallest cichlid species in the world. Its natural habitat is the Neothauma shell beds of Lake Tanganyika, where it forms huge colonies with thousands of individuals. Their unique behavior is associated with their affinity to shells. They burrow sand to move shells, take refuge in shells and also breed in them. They have pale white coloring with black vertical bars running the length of their bodies. The species is sexually monomorphic, meaning sexing individuals is extremely hard or impossible based on external appearance alone (although size separates them when fully adult). Aquarium care In the aquarium trade N. multifasciatus are commonly known as \\"multies\\" and are moderately popular. Stores specializing in fish or quality fish stores will at least be aware of shell dwelling fish even if they are not stocked at that time. They are not as popular as larger cichlids but because they are suitable for smaller tanks and due to their prolific nature they still are widely available. Tank requirements are very similar to other African cichlids, an example is the Mbuna. Unique requirements include a sandy substrate for burrowing and the placement of shells. A tank should have at least one shell per fish, ideally two. Two other species of fish are similar to N. multifasciatus; N. similis and N. brevis. The three species are similar enough that stores normally sell them all under the common name \\"shellies\\" or \\"shell dwellers\\".

It was originally released for the 3DO in 1995; ports of the game for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were later developed by Beam Software, and a PC version was licensed by Microsoft and released for Microsoft Windows. It was a pack-in game for Panasonic models of the 3DO later in the console's life. It is the first in the Gex series of video games, and introduces players to the title character, a wisecracking, television-obsessed gecko voiced by comedian Dana Gould, who must venture through the \\"Media Dimension\\" and defeat Rez, the overlord of the dimension who wants to make Gex into his new network mascot. Gex was created by Lyle Hall in 1993 shortly after he had joined Crystal Dynamics, and initially followed a movie stuntman named Gecko X before being retooled at the advisory of lead programmer Gregg Tavares. The game's lead character was intended as a mascot for the developer who could rival the likes of other immensely popular platformer characters ‚Äì primarily Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. Initially intended for completion in June 1994, and later in September of that year, development of the game took 21 months, with time constraints and a limited development team leading to numerous production difficulties. Several features were cut because of a necessity to complete the game on time, but some of these features were later re-added by a team of developers who programmed several other secret features into the game. It was released in April 1995 to largely positive reviews from critics; particular praise was aimed at Gex's unique platforming abilities and Gould's voice work as the character. The 3DO version of the game managed to sell over a million copies, making it one of the system's better-selling games. Two sequels were later released, titled Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, with Gex becoming Crystal Dynamics' mascot for a short time. Gameplay Gex in a horror level. The jumping tomato is an enemy. The features in the display bar, from left to right, are the player's score, number of lives, number of flies, and health. Gex is a side-scrolling platformer that follows the title character Gex, an anthropomorphic, television-obsessed gecko who must travel through the \\"media dimension\\" and defeat the game's antagonist, Rez. Gex must traverse through 24 levels contained in five different TV channels which act as game worlds (accessed through a world map), each filled with platforming stages and ending with a boss stage. The goal of each stage is to explore and locate hidden television remotes which are used to unlock more levels. The original 3DO version of the game allows players to save their progress and resume from where they left off; all other versions use a password system. The player unlocks passwords or is granted a save opportunity by beating a boss stage or finding video tapes hidden in certain levels. Every level contains a hidden portal which leads to a bonus level, the perfect completion of which earns the player a piece of the Planet X remote. Collecting every piece of this remote allows them to reach Planet X, an optional secret world. Many of Gex's default abilities take advantage of his special characteristics as a gecko. In addition to being able to walk, run, and jump, he can attach himself to walls and ceilings and crawl along them using the suction pads on his feet, allowing him to reach higher areas. Gex primarily attacks with his tail; he can whip it in a full circle to defeat enemies, activate switches, and deflect projectiles. He can coil it into the shape of a spring to bounce off enemies and other objects. Levels contain assorted collectible power-ups which can provide Gex with several different abilities, such as enhanced speed, invulnerability, and one of many different types of projectiles that can be launched from his mouth. Gex can obtain and utilize these power-ups by lashing his gecko tongue out and consuming them; alternatively, these items can be tail whipped in order to replenish lost health at the expense of the item's primary effect. Gex's health is represented by three \\"hit paws\\", and he loses one whenever he is hit by an enemy or a hazard. If the player loses all of their hit paws, then they lose a life. The number of hit paws can be extended to six by finding a certain power-up. The player begins the game with three lives, though more can be earned by collecting a hundred Golden flies in a level. Losing all lives causes the game to be over, forcing players to restart from the beginning (or from they last saved in the 3DO release). =Plot= Gex, a young anthropomorphic gecko, lives by himself watching TV and eating snacks in his mansion in Maui, Hawaii, which he acquired after inheriting a large sum of money from his uncle that passed away. While looking for a good show to watch, he consumes a passing house fly. This insect turns out to be a small undercover drone being controlled by Rez, the overlord of the Media Dimension. Rez uses the droid to \\"bug\\" Gex, and pulls him into the Media Dimension through the TV set, intending to use him as the network's new mascot character. In order to escape, Gex needs to traverse the Media Dimension and find remote controls which he could use to destroy the TV sets blockading his exit back to the outside world. Gex fights his way through the Media Dimension, finding remotes and defeating Rez' accomplices along the way, before eventually defeating Rez himself using some of the tyrant's own drones against him. Gex, upon returning home, resumes watching his TV, wondering what was on HBO. Development and release The concept for Gex was created by Lyle Hall, who began work on the project shortly after joining the newly- formed Crystal Dynamics in 1993. Hall wanted the game to \\"take advantage of both the graphics prowess and the CD audio capabilities\\" of Panasonic's 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console, intending to create a 2D platform game starring \\"the coolest character I could come up with.\\" It was created with the intention of a new mascot in mind, with Crystal Dynamics pushing for a character who could rival the likes of other gaming icons such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. Initially, the development team consisted of four people; Hall, who served as the game's producer, Mira Ross and Susanne Dougherty as artists, and Gregg Travers as the lead programmer (later on, Justin Knorr was hired as the game's lead designer). The game initially centered around a Hollywood film stunt performer named \\"Gecko X\\" who needed to help save his contracted film studio from going bankrupt at the volition of the antagonist, Karl Chameleon. Each stage was themed around a film genre (i.e. a level inspired by Western films) and would begin by showing stock footage from a vintage film of that genre. The player would then traverse the level and perform \\"stunts\\" along the way, with the player's performance dictating the amount of money the film would earn at the box office and how well the studio would do. The concept was eventually nixed at the suggestion of Travers, who argued that placing the levels in such realistic settings would lead to a lack of sensible design structure, and a new, more fantastical concept was brainstormed, in which a new villain, named Rezull, would capture Gex and bring him into a ‚ÄúTV Land‚Äù where he would have to escape by collecting magical TV remotes and fighting Rezull‚Äôs armada of ‚Äúvideo warriors‚Äù made of TV static. Gex's voice was provided by comedian Dana Gould, who wrote all of the character's dialogue. During its production, Gex went through various development challenges due to schedule issues. Work on the game began in late 1993, with a development deadline of June 1994. The development team initially came up with six different worlds themed around varying TV channels, including a horror world and a science fiction world. Each world was given three distinct sets of art design that could be used to create unique levels; for instance, the horror world had a haunted house set, a graveyard set, and a \\"Mode 2\\" set for a vertically scrolling level. While working on the game, they found that developing game art for Gex was far harder than it had been with 16-bit video games, as the expanded 32-bit memory in combination with the storage capabilities of a compact disc meant that far more art could be made. With two artists working on the game's assets, a single in-game level took around two months to complete. Because Crystal Dynamics' two other 3DO games being developed at the time, Crash N Burn and Total Eclipse, only required a small number of artists, Panasonic was hesitant in hiring additional artists to the game's development team, presuming it to be unnecessary. Because of this limited development team, the game took longer to produce than anticipated. Eventually, the company began bringing other artists in to work on designing characters, including Steve Kongsle (who had been working on Crash N Burn and designed Gex). In the middle of the game's strenuous development, a number of Gexs developers- among whom were programmer Danny Chan and Evan Wells, as well as various people from outside of development- joined together to secretly program several features into the game. The unused sci-fi art from the game was used to make a series of secret levels. A small 2D shooting game programmed by Wells as his Senior project at Stanford University was added in to the game, as was a small minigame made by scriptor Susan Michelle. These additions were kept in unbeknownst to the company until they were discovered through playtesting. The additions were kept in the game. The \\"secret team\\" also programmed a hidden extended end credits sequence which featured photos of the staff, as well as a wide array of concept art, sketches and storyboards, which came to last a total of 18 minutes after being completed. This sequence could be accessed by completing all of the sci-fi levels as well as the shooter level. At one point in development, one of the stages designed by Knorr was edited without his permission. The level had several parts with bugs that Knorr requested to be fixed. Since the game was eight to nine months late of its initial completion deadline, rather than working around the bugs, the company removed these parts in order to ship the game sooner. Knorr was infuriated by this, and in response, left a hidden message in one of the levels teaching the player a cheat code to get to the game's stage select (which contained over 80 level slots despite only 28 levels being in the game) and telling them to pick a specific stage, which contained the original version of this level. There, he hid three more messages, including one which disclosed the personal phone number of head of product development Madeline Canepa and telling the players to call her and \\"give her a piece of your mind and my mind too\\". This addition was ultimately found by playtesters, leading to the immediate firing of Knorr. By June 1994, very little progress had been made on Gex, with less than half of the game complete. The multiple art sets were reduced to only one per level, and the Mode 2 section and the sci-fi world in its entirety were scrapped. The team hoped to have the game finished by September so that it could be released for the holiday season in December. However, by September, the game was still vastly incomplete, with unfinished level designs and no in-game audio, and by the end of 1994 it was clear that the game would still need extra time to be finished. Gex was released for the 3DO in April 1995 after around 21 months of development. It was also included later on in the 3DO's lifespan as a pack-in title bundled with certain units of the console. The game was later ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, both of which were developed by Beam Software and released in North America on December 18, 1995 under Crystal Dynamics' brand and in Europe on April 5, 1996. A Microsoft Windows port of Gex was released on November 7, 1996 and a demo was bundled with the Microsoft Interactive CD Sampler. The game was later rereleased on the PlayStation Store on November 6, 2009. Reception Tommy Glide of GamePro highly praised Gex, stating that he \\"sets high standards for all future 3DO platform-hoppers\\" and predicting that the character would reach popularity levels similar to Sonic and Mario. Next Generation called it \\"one of the most solid and enjoyable side-scrolling action games in a while.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game their \\"Game of the Month\\" award. The game was awarded \\"Best 3DO Game\\" at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show by GamePro and \\"Best 3DO Game of 1995\\" by Electronic Gaming Monthly. Gilde highly praised Gex's visuals, and wrote that it would \\"win a 3DO beauty pageant\\". Prior to release, GameFans E. Storm called Gex's model \\"one of the best looking and animated characters that [they] have ever seen\\" and praised the game's environments and parallax scrolling; however, he also expressed disdain in the game's titular character dawning the only pre-rendered model out of all of the characters, although he admitted that they were still \\"drawn well for the most part.\\" In a later set of reviews from the same publication following the game's release, reviewer K. Lee praised the mix of bitmapped graphics and SGI renders used for the sprites. The other 2 Gamefan reviewers, Nick Rox and \\"Skid\\", expressed awe at the game's ability to extensively use parallax scrolling in spite of the 3DO's limited hardware. Gameplay was deemed unique by many critics, who praised its integration of Gex's abilities as a gecko. Lee called Gexs gameplay mechanics \\"the icing on the cake\\" as well as praising the inclusion of game secrets. Gilde aimed particular praise towards Gex's ability to climb surfaces, saying that players could \\"get into the groove\\" of using the skill despite stating that it was initially frustrating trying to guess which walls were and were not climbable. A reviewer for Next Generation contested that Gex's wall climbing ability was \\"not completely unique\\" but that it nonetheless added an interesting dimension to the gameplay. Storm advised that the game controlled the best when playing using the 3DO's Goldstar controller. Gould's in-game voiceover for Gex was highly praised. Gilde stated that it never became obnoxious due to the wide range of different one-liners present in-game. Storm called Gex's voice \\"the first time a game character has ever been given voice and personality that has actually turned out to be cool\\" and stated that the many written phrases suited his character. Skid felt that the vocals added to the game's enjoyability, while Rox wrote that they were mostly \\"hilarious... when you can hear them over the music and sound effects.\\" In reviewing the PC version for PC Powerplay, David Wildgoose wrote that Gex's \\"American slacker voice\\" would be viewed by players as either \\"cool or grating\\", although he admitted to personally not minding it. Lee praised the game's music, calling it \\"high quality.\\" The game's ports received varying levels of praise. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed the PlayStation and Saturn versions, commenting that the audio and cinemas in both versions were cleaned up compared to the 3DO original. They especially praised the game's humor and solid platforming action. Tommy Glide likewise stated in GamePro that the PlayStation version had \\"cleaner graphics and smoother gameplay\\" than the 3DO version. He also remarked the Saturn version has \\"the same graphics, sound, and control that earned acclaim in the PlayStation version\\", and held it favorably above Bug!, another platform game for the Sega Saturn. IGN stated that the game was still as fun on the PlayStation than it was on the 3DO, despite noting that very few changes had been made. Next Generations review of the Saturn port remarked that Gex was nowhere near as fresh as it was when it debuted on the 3DO, but still witty and fun. In a negative review of the game, Rob Allsetter commented in Sega Saturn Magazine that although the visuals and game flow were acceptable, they were both negated by the game's \\"utter predictability.\\" Maximum gave the PlayStation version a mixed review, saying that the player character has a remarkable variety of abilities, but that the level design is often dull and frustrating. Wildgoose praised the PC port of the game, stating that it was still enjoyable despite calling it a \\"slightly aged console platformer\\". Gex was one of the best-selling 3DO games, but the exact sales figures remain unclear. In July 1995, roughly a month before it became a pack-in game, its sales exceeded one million units according to GamePro and Electronic Gaming Monthly. Contradictory to this, an article in Next Generation cover-dated November 1995 says that the 3DO version had sold only 750,000 units worldwide. Sequels and legacy The moderate success of Gex produced two sequels, with the eponymous character becoming the recurring mascot for Crystal Dynamics. In 1998, Crystal Dynamics released a sequel to Gex called Gex: Enter the Gecko for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, following Gex once again as he travels to defeat Rez. Unlike the first game, a 2D side- scrolling title, this game is a 3D platformer, playing in a vein similar to games such as Super Mario 64. A year later, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko was released, featuring Playboy model and Baywatch actress Marliece Andrada as a new character named Agent XTra who is captured by Rez. Since the release of Gex, the series has collectively sold 15 million units. Although Gex 3 was the last game in the Gex series to date, developer Square Enix, who holds the rights to the franchise, announced in 2013 that they would be holding a \\"Square Enix Collective\\" program in which they would give budding game developers opportunities to develop a new game in one of three different series ‚Äì among which was Gex, alongside Fear Effect and Anachronox. The program began in 2015, with Square opening itself up to pitches from independent developers.

It was operated from 1993 to 1995 by the Frankfurter Verkehrsverbund (Frankfurt transport association, FVV) as the T-Bahn and subsequently by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association, RMV) as line 15 (RB 15). It is listed in table 637 of the Deutsche Bahn timetable. The Friedrichsdorf‚ÄìBrandoberndorf line, which has the infrastructure number of 9374, forms part of the old Friedrichsdorf‚ÄìWetzlar line, which was known as the Taunusbahn. The line is owned by the Verkehrsverband Hochtaunus (High Taunus transport association, VHT). The infrastructure is managed by HLB Basis AG on behalf of the VHT.  Operations S-Bahn standards (high platforms and platform display) in K√∂ppern station The Taunus Railway is one of three S-Bahn-like suburban lines to the west of Frankfurt, which are operated by Hessischen Landesbahn GmbH (HLB) through its subsidiary HLB Hessenbahn GmbH. All stations have platform displays installed, which notify the next train. 975,000 train-kilometres per year are operated over the line, which can be operated over at up to . = Rolling stock= The rolling stock used are LHB VT 2E diesel multiple units, which were modernised in 2006/2007. Eleven DMUs procured specifically for the Taunus Railway by the VHT were procured together with nine DMUs of the HLB to be used on the lines to K√∂nigstein and Bad Soden. Since the 2006 timetable change, they have been supported by ten LINT 41/H sets. From their procurement in 1994/1995 to their replacement by LINT sets, the Taunus Railway was also served by class 628 sets and two class 629 railcars. = Rail services= Services on the Taunus Railway operate every half hour on weekdays. In addition, four or five additional train pairs operate in the morning and afternoon peaks from Monday to Friday; these operate to/from Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof and, for operational reasons, run predominantly to/from K√∂nigstein. About every second train ends in Gr√§venwiesbach, while Brandoberndorf is served every hour. On Saturday, apart from a break in the morning, there is also a service every half hour between Gr√§venwiesbach and Bad Homburg until about 4 pm; and on Sundays there is an hourly service over the whole route. The timetable is designed so that the trains that end in Bad Homburg always has a connection to S-Bahn line S 5 to/from Frankfurt. The towns and district that are away from the line are connected to the Taunus Railway by bus services that are commissioned by the VHT.  Route LINT double set shortly after Neu-Anspach The line consists of part of the former Deutsche Bundesbahn Frankfurt‚ÄìWetzlar (Solmsbach Valley Railway) and Frankfurt‚ÄìWeilburg (Weil Valley Railway) lines, which were closed by Deutsche Bundesbahn beyond Gr√§venwiesbach. Today services on the Taunus Railway run on the extension of the Homburg Railway to Friedrichsdorf, which they share with the S5 services. They continue to Brandoberndorf over the single-track and non-electrified line, which is the property of the Verkehrsverband Hochtaunus. In the peak hour, trains start and end every hour at Frankfurt Hbf. In contrast to the S5, the trains do not stop underground, but on the above- ground long-distance tracks. While the S5 services turn to run on the Homburg Railway immediately north of Frankfurt West station, the Taunus Railway service (the RB 15) first runs on the regional tracks towards Frankfurt-H√∂chst (Taunus Railway) and then curves on the Rebstock lands on a connecting curve (Rebstockkurve) of the former Bad Nauheim‚ÄìWiesbaden railway (B√§derbahn) to join the route of the S5 shortly before R√∂delheim station. It follows the S5 service with only two stops in R√∂delheim and Oberursel to Bad Homburg VT 2E of the Hessische Landesbahn on the Taunusbahn on the way from Wehrheim to Neu- Anspach The regular interval services start In Bad Homburg. After Seulberg, where the Taunus Railway services to and from Frankfurt mostly do not stop, the Taunus Railway reaches Friedrichsdorf, the terminus of the RB 16 and the S5 services. This is the start of a moderate climb past the former Industrial siding from R√ºhl Chemie and the Tettauer glassworks to the first crossing station at K√∂ppern, which has a short loading track next to the platform tracks. The line passes through the main ridge of the Taunus in the K√∂ppern valley, following the Erlenbach, and passes through Saalburg station, which was designated as Saalburg/Lochm√ºhle from 1993 to 2008, and the Limes. An uphill section begins after Wehrheim station, which also has a loading track. Over the hill, after passing an old brickyard (which once have a siding), a curved section leads to Neu-Anspach, which was the only station that had been reduced to a halt (Haltepunkt, that is, has no sets of points) before the modernisation of the line. It was re-equipped with points in 1992. Just under a kilometre further is the halt of Hausen. LINT on the Hundstadt Curve A long run through open fields leads to Usingen, where the line's central signal box is located and trains are stored, assembled, disassembled and refueled. This was formerly the location of the loading station of the 4 km-long narrow-gauge railway to a geyserite works (now Bremthaler Quarzitwerk) and a siding from Raiffeisen Waren-Zentrale Rhein-Main (an agricultural cooperative). The section with the steepest grade (up to 2.147%) begins there; Wilhelmsdorf station, which is at the end of it, is a good 390 metres above sea level. A narrow gauge railway branched off here against the direction of travel to Merzhausen military airfield (now used for the Erdfunkstelle Usingen, Usingen earth station). After another slight climb past the junction of the BGS camp, the line reaches its high point at the edge of the forest. From there it goes to Gr√§venwiesbach, where some trains can be stored, and down around a loop to Hundstadt. Hasselborn Tunnel (1,300 m) The continuation of the line, on the route of the original Solmsbach Valley Railway (Solmsbachtalbahn), climbs past the former J√§gerhaus timber loading point, which was used in freight operations from 1913 to 1985 and for passenger traffic from 1954 to 1981, and immediately afterwards passes through the Hasselborn Tunnel, which passes through the border into the Lahn-Dill-Kreis. The 1,300 m-long tunnel lies on a slight incline and is almost straight. During the war, it was originally supposed to be used for the safe storage of the special trains of Adolf Hitler while he was in the nearby Adlerhorst. Due to the increasing air raids on Frankfurt around 1941, the VDM copper works at Heddernheim shifted parts of the war production here and used forced labourers, which is commemorated on a plaque near the south portal. Shortly after the end of the tunnel is the new halt of Hasselborn which was moved from the old station about 100 metres closer to the village in 1999. Behind it, the line continues descending, until the final station is finally reached in Brandoberndorf, which is in the municipality of Waldsolms. It is located a few metres south of the old station. There are two unused sidings in the station area. The stations of K√∂ppern, Saalburg, Wehrheim, Neu-Anspach, Usingen and Wilhelmsdorf on the single-track section have two platform tracks, which are protected on both sides by exit signals, and allow trains to cross; Gr√§venwiesbach has three tracks. These passing loops mean that the line has significant capacity. There is no crossing loop on the section between Gr√§venwiesbach and Brandoberndorf.  History Fahrplan Usingen‚ÄìHomburg 1895 On 15 October 1895, the Usingen Railway (Usinger Bahn) was opened as an extension of the Homburg Railway, which had opened in 1860. From 1 June 1909, it was extended via a zig zag in Gr√§venwiesbach to the Lahn valley at Weilburg. The Solmsbach Valley Railway (Solmsbachtalbahn) was opened to Albshausen on 1 November 1912. Initially a junction station, Bad Homburg Neu, was built in Bad Homburg; this was located some distance from the former terminus of the line from Frankfurt. Both stations in Bad Homburg were replaced by a central station on 26 October 1907, making possible the uninterrupted operation of trains from the Main to the Lahn for the first time. The Homburg Railway was also extended via Friedrichsdorf to Friedberg and later double-tracked. In the process the beginning of the Usingen Railway was moved from Bad Homburg to Friedrichsdorf. On the evening of 4 October 1944, train no. 2021 from Frankfurt to Usingen was strafed shortly before the entrance to K√∂ppern and 31 people died. The Weil Valley Railway has not been used since 27 September 1969. Passenger traffic on the Solms Valley Railway was also discontinued on 31 May 1985. VT 2E railcar in Bad Homburg station In 1988, a special association of 13 towns, municipalities and the Hochtaunus district founded the Verkehrsverband Hochtaunus (High Taunus transport association, VHT). The line from Gr√§venwiesbach to Friedrichsdorf (a station now served by the S-Bahn) was still open but threatened with closure, but it was taken over by the VHT in 1989. This was followed by an extensive modernisation of the signaling technology and of the stations over 18 months. The formerly parallel bus service was converted into a feeder route. The former stations of Saalburg and Neu-Anspach, which had been reduced to halts had their sidings restored. Deutsche Bundesbahn initially continued operations. Since 27 September 1992, through tickets have been issued in the transport association's area in consultation with the Frankfurter Verkehrsverbund (Frankfurt transport association). On 26 September 1993, the Frankfurt-K√∂nigsteiner Eisenbahn AG (Frankfurt-K√∂nigstein Railway Company, FKE, then a subsidiary of HLB) took over the management of the line on behalf of the transport association and the line was also leased to the FKE. The Taunus Railway trains then ran from Bad Homburg and some ran from Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof in the peak. In contrast to practice in DB and FVV times, services on the Homburg Railway started and ended in Friedrichsdorf and no regular services still continued on the Taunus Railway. The T-Bahn of the FVV was transferred on 26 May 1995 to the newly founded Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV) and received the regional route number of 15 with services at 30-minute intervals. LINT set in the terminus of Brandoberndorf, with the old station in the background Because of the great success of the new method of operation, the section to Brandoberndorf was reactivated by the VHT and the Verkehrsverbund Lahn Dill (Lahn Dill transport association, VLD) on 15 November 1999. In 1996, the Lahn-Dill-Kreis acquired the route of the eight-kilometre-long railway line between Brandoberndorf and Gr√§venwiesbach from DB AG and transferred it to the VHT. The Hasselborn Tunnel, which the section of line passes through, was still in an exceptional condition. The signalling was brought up to date and later renovated again. The low speed limit in the tunnel was raised in 2007. In March 2006, the FKE transferred normal operations to the HLB subsidiary HLB Hessenbahn GmbH. Under the 2006/2007 timetable change, commencing in December 2006, services were cut on many routes due to cuts in local public transport funding, but the Taunus Railway was the only RMV line to gain services. Following planning in 2005, the platforms of the stations from K√∂ppern to Usingen were extended in the autumn of 2006 in order to enable the operation of trains made up of four VT 2E railcars or three LINT 41 railcars. In November 2007, train destination indicators were installed along the whole line. At the change of timetable on 9 December 2007, the control system was integrated with the signal boxes to clearly indicate departure times and any delays. In February 2008, regular operations were started. Prior to its modernisation, traffic was forecast to increase from then 1,500 in 1989 to 4,000 passengers per day. 7,000 passengers were counted each day in 1995, 8,000 in 1998, 9,300 in 2005 and 11,000 in 2012. Freight operations were taken over by DB AG in 1994. The operation were initially operated by a locomotive of the Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn (BLE), but were later taken over by DB. It was operated ever more rarely and with the abandonment of standard freight rates on 5 November 2000, individual freight movements as required are unusual.  Prospects Friedrichsdorf and Bad Homburg, Taunusbahn services serve the line with the S-Bahn. An upgrade of the line to provide better connections is discussed regularly. The current considerations and investigations envisage the electrification of the line to Usingen at the end of 2022 and the extension of S-Bahn line S5 services over this section. This would allow the existing class 423 sets would be used‚Äîwhich would create no additional costs‚Äîbut new vehicles would need to be procured for electrical operations to Gr√§venwiesbach. This would have to be done before the start of the upcoming call for tenders for the operation of rail services. However, municipal committees and parties have demanded the electrification of the line beyond Usingen to Gr√§venwiesbach and Brandoberndorf, which would make its implementation uncertain. On 18 May 2015, the district council of the Hochtaunuskreis unanimously voted to commission the Hochtaunus transport association to carry out the electrification of the Taunus Railway for the conversion to electrical operations at the timetable change in December 2019. In negotiations with the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund a few points were to be ensured in relation to the operation of the Taunus Railway. These were designed for the long-term protection of the line, in particular the section beyond Usingen (including its possible later electrification), the maintenance of the through trains to and from Frankfurt, barrier-free interchange in Usingen and a coordinated operating concept including feeder buses. In mid- February, a cooperation agreement between the Verkehrsverband Hochtaunus and the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund was concluded, after which the RMV promised to bear half of the planning costs of ‚Ç¨4 million. The planning approval procedure would be initiated (according to the assessment at that time) in 2017 and the construction work would begin at the earliest in 2018. Accordingly, the original target date for the changeover to electric operations at the change to the 2019 timetable could not be met. The changeover would occur at the earliest at the timetable change in December 2020 with the introduction of operations under a new contract for the Taunus-Netzes (Taunus network). The feasibility of extending electric operations to Gr√§venwiesbach would be examined. A further delay has arisen as a second cost-benefit analysis had to be carried out for the electrification to Gr√§venwiesbach, which was planned as a second stage. Therefore, the planning approval procedure for the electrification to Usingen will start in 2018. Accordingly, the Verkehrsverband Hochtaunus, as the owner of the line, had not yet announced the approval of the electrification works as of mid-2017. Electrical operations can therefore be started at the earliest at the timetable change in December 2022. Extensive renovation of the Hasselborn tunnel is required for the extension of electrification to Brandoberndorf. The exact cost was expected to be known in May 2015. In November it was announced that the Rhine- Main Transport Association, the Hochtaunuskreis and the Lahn-Dill had agreed on the work. The RMV agreed to assume a 70% share of the ‚Ç¨10 million costs. The rehabilitation is also only possible after the municipality of Waldsolms approved funding for an alternative drinking water supply for the district of Hasselborn (instead of water collected from leakage into the tunnel). Work was scheduled to start around the clock from the start of the summer 2016 holidays until the end of the autumn holidays in a multi-shift operation. On 31 October 2016, the work was completed after four months and the tunnel was reopened for traffic. In this work, 23 of 161 blocks (about 194 metres) of the tunnel were rehabilitated and the remaining blocks are to be rehabilitated in various stages of construction until 2021. The cost of the current construction stage amounts to ‚Ç¨3.3 million and the entire renovation of the tunnel is currently estimated to cost about ‚Ç¨10 million. At the beginning of November 2014, it was announced that the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund and Alstom had agreed to use new railcars with fuel cell propulsion (iLINT) on the lines of the Taunus network (12, 13, 15 and 21) from 2018 at the earliest. In the case of the Taunus Railway, the possible electrification would not be affected.

Their name is a play on the title of the 1908 Scouting handbook Scouting for Boys. The band consists of childhood friends from London, Roy Stride on piano and lead guitar/vocals, Greg Churchouse on bass guitar and Professor James Rowlands on percussion. Having formed in 2005, they signed to Epic Records in 2007. They released their self-titled debut album that September and it reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in 2008. To date, it has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the UK. A second album, Everybody Wants to Be on TV, was released in April 2010 and peaked at number 2 on the Albums Chart. This was preceded by the single \\"This Ain't a Love Song\\", which went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks. To date, Scouting for Girls have achieved eight top 40 singles, sold over 2,000,000 records and received over 500m streams. They have been nominated for four Brit Awards and one Ivor Novello Award.  History  = Formation = The founding members had known each other since childhood. Stride and Ellard met in the Cub Scouts and Churchouse met Stride on their first day at school at Queensmead School in South Ruislip in west London. They attended the school until 1998 then moved on towards a music career. At the age of 15 Roy and Greg were playing together at small gigs in west London. It has been noted that the band was looking for a spirited way of removing themselves from the drudgery of their everyday lives, looking to the whimsy of childhood fantasy through playing a Moog organ. Churchouse has observed on several occasions that playing bass is something he wanted to pursue as the bass has \\"two less strings\\". = Unsigned and early music: pre-2007 = Whilst in University Stride and Churchouse were in a band called Cape. Scouting for Girls were formed when Stride swapped from playing the guitar to piano. Their first recording was a demo of Keep On Walking which impressed the judges of the 2005 Glastonbury unsigned competition so much that they offered them a place in the final, despite the band having never performed live before. Although they failed to win the competition the band spent the next couple of years building a large online presence through Myspace and hosting their own club nights at the Trinity Pub in Harrow. By 2007 the band had written and recorded demos of most of the songs that would make up their debut album and received airplay and performed sessions on Radio 1 and XFM = Debut album and early singles: 2007‚Äì2008 = At the beginning of 2007 Epic Records A&R; Nick Raphael received the band's demo CD. So enthusiastic was his response that he immediately phoned up colleague Jo Charrington and said: \\"These are hits, let's go see the band in rehearsals!\\" According to Charrington every other record label had passed on them. On 14 February 2007, Scouting for Girls were signed to Epic UK (a division of Sony BMG). As the band were signed almost fully formed, with all their songs already written, they headed out to Helioscentric Studios in Rye, East Sussex to begin work on their debut album almost immediately. Produced by Andy Green (Keane, KT Tunstall, The Feeling), the band's first release was the It's Not About You EP, released on 25 June 2007. It sold out, and became the highest-charting limited edition EP in chart history. The album was released in September 2007, and has sold in excess of 1,000,000 copies in the UK alone. It spawned a host of hit singles; \\"She's So Lovely\\", \\"Heartbeat\\", and \\"Elvis Ain't Dead\\". Scouting for Girls' self-titled album went to number 1 in the UK Albums Chart on 20 January 2008, where it remained for two weeks. The band toured the UK heavily throughout 2007 and 2008, upgrading and selling out venues in every city they performed. During their first tour of 2008, Roy Stride lost his voice en route to a gig in Birmingham and was diagnosed with laryngitis, forcing the band to reschedule a series of dates on the tour. The rescheduled dates included an extra night in London, with the band selling out a record four consecutive nights at the Shepherds Bush Empire. The band's final tour of the year concluded with two sold-out nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo, and one at London's Brixton Academy. Scouting for Girls also made a series of appearances in Europe, Japan, Australia and America in 2008, including performances at 2008's SXSW Conference in Austin, Texas and CMJ in New York City. = Everybody Wants to Be on TV: 2009‚Äì2012 = Scouting for Girls returned to Helioscentric Studios (East Sussex, UK) in 2009 to commence work on their second album with producer Andy Green (who produced the band's eponymous debut album). The album, Everybody Wants To Be on TV, was released in the UK on 12 April 2010. The first single to be taken from the record was \\"This Ain't a Love Song\\" which went straight to number 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 4 April 2010, giving the band 2010's Easter Number 1. The track has been added to radio playlists in Australia, including Sydney Radio Station: Nova 969 FM as at May 2010. In the lead up to the album's release, Scouting for Girls performed in the Woolpack Pub on the set of long-running British soap, Emmerdale for a Radio Aire session. Scouting for Girls toured their new album throughout 2010, commencing with a full UK tour throughout late April and May 2010. The band also took part in a sponsored Chopper bicycle ride from London to Brighton for the charity WellChild raising over ¬£20,000. The band released the second single, \\"Famous\\", from the album on 12 July 2010. The single peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their sixth Top 40 single overall. = The Light Between Us: 2012 = On 5 March 2012, Scouting for Girls announced via Twitter that they had begun the process of recording their third studio album, The Light Between Us. The album included the top 20 hit \\"Love How it Hurts\\" that had reached number 17 in 2011 The Light Between Us debuted at number 10 in the official 100 on 9 September 2012, one week after the release of second single \\"Summertime In the City\\". = Greatest Hits: 2013‚Äì2014 = In 2013 the band released a Greatest Hits compilation that peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. In addition to all their singles, the album also featured new material including the song \\"Millionaire\\" which peaked at 52 in the UK charts after release on 22 July 2013. = Still Thinking About You: 2015 = The band released their fourth album Still Thinking About You in October 2015 on EastWest records. The album reached No.13 on the UK chart and featuring festive fan favourite \\"Christmas in the Air (Tonight)\\". = Tenth anniversary and Ten Add Ten album: 2017 = The band announced a show at London's Bush Hall to coincide with the tenth anniversary of them signing their first record deal. The band held a ticket ballot beforehand and received over 20,000 applications for just 300 tickets. The band announced on social media that they were working on new music for release in 2017. Scouting for Girls announced on their official website that their next album would be released on 13 October 2017 with the lead single called \\"Dancing in the Daylight\\". For some reason, since the release of The Trouble With Boys in 2019, the band don't seem to consider Ten Add Ten as their fifth album, despite it featuring 10 new songs, as they refer to The Trouble With Boys as their fifth album in interviews. = The Trouble With Boys: 2019 = In September 2019, Scouting For Girls released their new album, The Trouble With Boys, featuring the singles \\"Count On Me\\" and \\"Grown Up\\" (co-written by James Blunt). A UK tour to promote the new album was also announced for November and December 2019. With the first date at the 300 capacity Mac Arts in Galashiels.  Awards  Scouting for Girls have never won an award but have been nominated for several over the years. * Three BRIT Awards in 2009 for British Breakthrough Act, British Live Act and British Single (\\"Heartbeat\\"). * 2011 BRIT Award for Best British Single with 'This Ain't A Love Song'. * Best New Act category in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. * Ivor Novello 2011 PRS For Music Most Performed Work award for: This Ain't A Love Song Writer: Roy Stride-performed By: Scouting for Girls-UK Publisher: EMI Music Publishing  Wolfcubs fan club  Before the band were signed to Epic Records, they ran their own fanclub, The Wolfcub Club through their Myspace site. The name was a wordplay similar to the band's name and was partly based on the Dennis the Menace fan club. Members of the fanclub were called Wolfcubs, and received a welcome pack put together by the band which include a CD of recent demos, a membership card which allowed discounted entry to their gigs, a regular SFG newsletter (similar to the famous Scouting For Boys guide book), and badges. When the band signed their record deal, they carried on producing the membership packs for new fans on the road, until the demand became too high to deal with. However, the Wolfcubs still exist in reference to the band's fans.  Charity work  Scouting for Girls are official ambassadors for the children's charity, Wellchild, and raised over ¬£20,000 for the charity by cycling from London to Brighton on children's chopper bikes in 2010. The band also hold an annual intimate show at the highest pub in the UK, The Tan Hill Inn to raise money for Children in Need. In 2016 both the band an audience were trapped overnight in the pub after a snow storm blocked roads down from the venue. Each year the event raises over ¬£10,000 for charity In 2017, to celebrate their Tenth Anniversary, the band undertook 10 challenges to raise money and awareness for the Alzheimer's Association. The events include Dry January, The Silverstone Half Marathon and the London Marathon. The band achieved their target of rasing ¬£10,000 for the charity.

It marked the scriptwriting debut of Century 21 voice actor Shane Rimmer, and was first broadcast on 27 October 1967 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons destroy and reconstruct a maintenance technician and his snowcat to attack the Frost Line Outer Space Defence System in Canada. Plot The Frost Line Outer Space Defence System is a network of missile bases in Northern Canada, tasked with protecting Earth from extraterrestrial threats.The script describes the location thus: \\"[The Frost Line Outer Space Defence System] stretches in a number of similar bases 3,000 miles across Northern Canada.\\" (Bentley 2008, p. 126.) In a transmission to Earth, the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) warn Spectrum that they intend to attack key Frost Line installations. They use their powers to destroy a snowcat driven by maintenance technician Eddie and reconstruct both Eddie and the snowcat as agents in their service. The reconstructed Eddie passes security at two bases ‚Äì Red Deer and Cariboo ‚Äì and plants devices inside their ventilation systems that render the air unbreathable, killing 250 personnel at Red Deer and 70 at Cariboo. In a transmission to Cloudbase, the belligerent Frost Line commander General Ward warns Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) that he will fire missiles at Mars if another base is attacked. Fearing the Mysterons' response to such an action, White orders Captain Scarlet and Lieutenant Green (voiced by Francis Matthews and Cy Grant) to investigate Red Deer. Arriving at the base, the officers discover that the personnel have suffocated not due to the introduction of a toxic gas, but the removal of all oxygen from the air. Obtaining a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle from a trapper, Scarlet and Green speed to the next base, Big Bear, only to learn that Eddie has already passed through and is now on his way to the Frost Line command centre. After knocking out a guard who is barring entry to the base, Green removes Eddie's oxygen- depletion device from the ventilation system before it can affect the air. Meanwhile, Scarlet takes the SPV and chases Eddie. The snowcat is carrying liquid oxygen, which Eddie dumps into Scarlet's path to force him off the road. Scarlet draws his gun and fires several rounds into a snow-covered slope nearby; this triggers an avalanche that pushes the snowcat over a cliff, causing it to explode on the rocks below. With the command centre saved, Ward, no less arrogant than before, radios Cloudbase to make peace with White. Production Actor Shane Rimmer had a prior association with Century 21, having voiced the character Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds and narrated the series' alternative two-part episode format. Impressed by his work, the Andersons asked him to write an episode of Captain Scarlet. Rimmer immediately agreed and was soon telephoned by series script editor Tony Barwick, who had an outline for an episode titled \\"Avalanche\\" and told Rimmer that a courier would \\"'[drop] the storyline over to you in about an hour. Take today and tomorrow and see how you'd go about filling it in.'\\" Resigning from his part- time job at a sheet metal factory to focus on this task, Rimmer put together a draft treatment over the next 24 hours; he found the characters and plot elements a \\"heavy mix to juggle with\\" but managed to incorporate \\"one or two workable story developments that avoided stepping on the toes of the series concept or any of the main characters.\\" Rimmer and Barwick revised the draft two days after. After the script for \\"Avalanche\\" was completed, Rimmer started work on treatments for the episodes \\"Expo 2068\\" and \\"Inferno\\" ‚Äì jobs that, in his words, \\"more or less took care of '67\\". He later wrote scripts for Joe 90, The Secret Service and The Protectors.Bentley 2017, p. 29. The script began with a description of the domes that make up the Frost Line Command Centre: \\"Deep snow surrounds the plexiglass domes ... From the large central dome acting as a hub, avenues run off in eight directions. At the end of each spoke at varying distances from the centre are smaller domes. Each dome is airtight and serviced by an artificial atmosphere from an air-conditioning dome.\\" Chris Bentley, author of The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide, suggests that some of this detail was lost in the transition from script to screen. On arrival at Red Deer Base, Scarlet and Green were described as wearing \\"space-type helmets\\"; in the episode as filmed, they wear breathing masks and their standard Spectrum caps. Eddie's snowcat was designed by special effects assistant Mike Trim, who had been interested in snowcats since childhood. The inspiration for the design was a caterpillar-track truck concept that Trim had produced for the Thunderbirds episode \\"End of the Road\\". To match the construction of the puppet set, Trim was forced to alter shape of the cabin, which he felt ended up \\"[giving] the final model a more upright look than I had hoped for.\\" The Frost Line domes that appear in the episode are represented not by scale models, but painted flats.Bentley 2017, p. 87. Filming began on 13 April 1967.Bentley 2017, p. 65. The incidental music was recorded on 11 June in a four-hour session at series composer Barry Gray's private studio, where it was performed by a group of 15 instrumentalists. Music for \\"Spectrum Strikes Back\\" was recorded during the same session. The main tracks for \\"Avalanche\\" are \\"Mountain Pass\\" (which accompanies the scene leading up to the death of the original Eddie) and \\"Deadly Mist and Mountain Chase\\" (which accompanies Scarlet's pursuit of the snowcat). Reception James Stansfield of entertainment website Den of Geek ranks \\"Avalanche\\" seventh in a list of \\"top 10\\" Captain Scarlet episodes, praising its \\"exciting\\" climax. He adds that it is one of several episodes that show the \\"flaws and ineptitude\\" of humanity to be \\"of a bigger danger than the Mysterons\\", arguing that General Ward is effectively a secondary antagonist. Geoff Willmetts of Sfcrowsnest offers a similar view on Ward, suggesting that the character exposes humanity's militaristic and belligerent aspects: \\"This Earth's reality is clearly far too aggressive compared to our own\\". Reviewing \\"Avalanche\\" for FAB magazine in 1993, Ian Fryer praised Ward's characterisation for introducing a \\"second layer of military as a repository for misgivings about the armed services.\\" \\"Avalanche\\" is one of a small number of episodes in which Lieutenant Green plays a major role in the field (here substituting for Captain Blue, who takes over Green's position as Cloudbase communications officer). Stansfield praises Rimmer's use of Green. Fryer argues that the number of deaths seen or reported in the episode (over 300) \\"must surely be a record for an Anderson series\\", noting that despite this figure the episode is certified U by the British Board of Film Classification. Stansfield, who points out the violent nature of the original Eddie's death, argues that this figure is \\"easily ... the highest body count of the series\\" and \\"a pretty large number for any TV show, let alone one for youngsters\\".

AFSOC is the Air Force component of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USAFSOS provides education to turn skilled Airmen into Air Commandos, a term used for U.S. Air Force Special Operators. The school provides specialized education to meet the unique requirements of AFSOC Airmen and joint and international special operations members. USAFSOS builds on the functional training conducted by other agencies like the USAF Air Education and Training Command and Other USSOCOM Service component training schools including Naval Special Warfare Command's Naval Special Warfare Center and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. History The USAF Special Operations School is the product of a 50-year evolutionary process. The process began in March 1961 when President John F. Kennedy, responding to Chairman Nikita S. Khruschev's clarion call for \\"wars of national liberation,\\" cited the need for countering \\"subversion and guerilla warfare\\" that were the heart of Communist insurgency. As a result, the Air Force increased the emphasis given to special air warfare training. The United States Air Force Special Air Warfare School (USAFSAWS) was originally a Directorate of the 4410th Combat Crew Training Wing at Hurlburt Field. In 1968, the school was re-designated USAFSOS. In June 1987, USAFSOS, as an organizational element of the 23rd Air Force, was assigned to the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), headquartered at MacDill AFB, Florida. In May 1990, the school became a direct reporting unit of the newly established Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). In October 2008, with the stand-up of the Air Force Special Operations Training Center, USAFSOS was placed under that unit, which was later reorganized on 11 February 2013 and renamed the Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center. Most recently, USAFSOS is aligned to the 492nd Special Operations Wing. During its formative years, the school's main thrust was the preparation of Air Force personnel for duty in Southeast Asia. Subsequently, USAFSOS has grown from teaching a single course the first year, to conducting 165 iterations of 20 different formal courses and 33 customized, Mobile Education Events (MEEs) in AY18. USAFSOS currently provides (SOF) indoctrination, as well as political, military, and cultural studies supporting SOF operations in the various combatant theaters. The school also provides language training, and specialized instructions on irregular warfare principles; building partner nation aviation capacity; aviation foreign internal defense; dynamics of international terrorism; and command, control and integration of Air Force Special Operation Forces (AFSOF) assets and AFSOF leadership development. Personnel and resources USAFSOS is a \\"de facto\\" joint school, because of heavy joint/civilian attendance and the joint nature of subjects taught. The staff and faculty have a diverse mix of career fields and expertise and are a range of Air Force officers and enlisted personnel, AF Reserve individual mobilization augmentees, AF civilians and contractors.  USAFSOS Mission and Vision  Mission: Execute operational Military education to forge Air Commandos ready to lead multi-national and joint teams across the spectrum of multi-domain operations during peace and wartime. Vision: The USAF & SOCOM preeminent educational center of excellence for Airpower in Irregular Warfare, Leadership, regional, and cultural studies. Curriculum The USAFSOS curriculum is directed by the AFSOC Commander to meet USSOCOM validated educational requirements. USAFSOS follows the USAF Instructional Systems Development model for course design and delivery. Currently, courses are organized in one of four content areas: Irregular Warfare, Regional and Cultural Expertise, Special Operations and Language Training. 1\\\\. Irregular Warfare courses educate SOF personnel on a range of adversarial threats and operational and technological countermeasures available for consideration. Irregular Warfare courses include Aviation Foreign Internal Defense, International Terrorism, Force Protection and Interagency. 2\\\\. Regional and Cultural Expertise courses are geared to SOF areas of responsibility and trace their roots to the very first course taught at USAFSOS. The purpose of these courses is to educate the SOF warrior to the cultural, historical, political, economic and security issues of a particular region. Regional courses include offering covering Africa, Europe, Asia, Central and South America and the Pacific. 3\\\\. Special Operations courses indoctrinate new members of AFSOC and prepare Air Force special operators for global missions. Special operations courses include Special Operations Air Command and Control and Intelligence. 4\\\\. The USAFSOS Language Center provides initial acquisition, sustainment and just in time language training across a range of Department of Defense established critical languages. Several USAFSOS courses utilize expert guest speakers, many at the top of their field, to ensure the most timely and relevant information is provided to the students. Over 700 such guest speakers, including former ambassadors, distinguished academicians, and active duty and retired flag-rank officers, regularly support USAFSOS. USAFSOS meets an increasing demand for \\"thinking warriors.\\" USAFSOS attendance Course offerings are available at several locations worldwide as determined by AFSOC requirements. For some courses, open seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis to members of the Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agencies. Students are responsible for ensuring security clearance requirements are met before attending courses. There are no tuition charges for U.S. military and government personnel attending USAFSOS courses. The owning unit funds student attendance.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.  History  John Joseph Cantwell founded Los Angeles Catholic Girls‚Äô High School in 1923. The faculty was composed of nuns from six Religious Orders: Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of the Holy Cross, Sisters of the Presentation of Mary and Sisters of Loretto. This collaboration combined the strength of many teaching sisterhoods and maintained Catholic education at its highest standard. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVMs) from Dubuque, Iowa, served at the school from 1940 to 1965. The school was dedicated in memory of Thomas James Conaty in recognition of his zeal for Catholic education. The school was renamed Bishop Conaty Memorial High School in 1955. Our Lady of Loretto High School was opened in September, 1949 during the episcopate of James Francis McIntyre. Cardinal McIntyre had just begun a building campaign for Catholic high schools throughout the Archdiocese. Our Lady of Loretto was the first school to be opened during this campaign. During its forty-year history, the school offered a curriculum of studies that challenged young women to meet their educational goals and to reach their fullest potential. left Changing community and times necessitated merging two schools to enable the Archdiocese to preserve the mission it began in 1923. In July, 1994 the school was officially named Bishop Conaty ‚Äì Our Lady of Loretto High School. Over the years, the strengths, Christian mission and traditions developed, preparing young women for their roles in the world.

The show documents the experiences of two different people who switch places for a day and learn how the other person lives. It started out as a short-form series, which premiered on October 25, 1999, as part of Noggin's variety series Phred on Your Head Show. The first half-hour episode premiered on April 30, 2000, and the last episode aired on October 18, 2005. The show aired on both Noggin and the main Nickelodeon channel. The show was originally aimed at pre-teens. By its third season, it had become a \\"serious-minded teenage documentary,\\" with episodes centered around topics such as homelessness, teen pregnancy, living with HIV/AIDS, and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The show was critically acclaimed. The episode \\"Living with HIV/AIDS\\" won a Peabody Award and a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Award. The episode \\"Teen Parent\\" won a Sexual Health in Entertainment Award. The third season was also the recipient of a Parents' Choice Award. Plot Each episode documents the experiences of two different people who switch places for a day and learn how the other person lives. As the two subjects express their thoughts and impressions on camera, as well as in online diaries on Noggin's website, they learn to appreciate diverse perspectives. The show was designed to help viewers get a first-hand look at how people from different backgrounds and perspectives see the world. History Noggin's general manager, Tom Ascheim, described the show's premise: \\"we take people of different backgrounds and lives and have them swap. And then we have them show us the conclusions they draw themselves.\\" Before each episode was filmed, Noggin staff members first proposed a topic for a new \\"switch\\"‚Äîsuch as two different races, music styles, or religions‚Äîthen researched the topic. If they decided that a switch was both doable and educational, they started looking for a pair of individuals to switch. Ascheim said \\"We try to find kids who seem natural and talk easily.\\" Once an episode's stars were chosen, Noggin hired experts on the topic as consultants. For example, for the episode \\"Catholic / Jewish,\\" interfaith experts Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Tom Hartman (commentators known as \\"The God Squad\\") served as consultants. The show's educational goals were developed with the curriculum standards set forth by the National Council for the Social Studies. A Walk in Your Shoes started out as a series of three short-form episodes. These shorts were tested as part of Noggin's variety series Phred on Your Head Show from October 25‚Äì29, 1999. According to a press release from Noggin, the show \\"received a strong response from kids when it debuted in short-form,\\" which led them to order a season of 13 long-form episodes. Two of the shorts were combined to make up one long-form episode (\\"City / Country & Circus / Suburb\\"), and the other short was appended to a separate long-form episode (\\"Big Boss / 4th Grader & Candy Store / Summer Camp\\"). The first season premiered on the main Nickelodeon channel on April 30, 2000. It aired on Noggin one day later, on May 1. Several other episodes were simulcast on both Noggin and Nickelodeon. Episodes =Shorts (1999)= The show started as a series of three shorts, shown as part of Noggin's Phred on Your Head Show. When A Walk in Your Shoes started its first long-form season, two of the shorts were combined to make up one long-form episode (\\"City / Country & Circus / Suburb\\"), and the other short was appended to a separate episode (\\"Big Boss / 4th Grader & Candy Store / Summer Camp\\"). *City / Country (October 25, 1999) *Candy Store / Summer Camp (October 26, 1999) *Circus / Suburb (October 27, 1999) =Season 1 (2000‚Äì01)= *Alaska / Hawaii (April 30, 2000) *City / Country & Circus / Suburb (May 8, 2000) *Wheelchair Basketball (May 15, 2000) *Big Boss / 4th Grader & Candy Store / Summer Camp (May 22, 2000) *Student / Principal (May 29, 2000) *Military School / Commune (July 31, 2000) *Desert / Water (August 28, 2000) *Cattle Drive / All That (September 18, 2000) *Juvenile Detention (November 13, 2000) *Teen / Retirement Home (December 4, 2000) *Catholic / Jewish (December 17, 2000) *Boy / Girl (January 29, 2001) *Only Child / Big Family (February 26, 2001) =Season 2 (2001‚Äì02)= *Boston / Bombay (April 16, 2001) *Blind (April 23, 2001) *Reunion Special (May 28, 2001) *Weatherman / Student (July 2, 2001) *New York City / Moscow (August 6, 2001) *Deaf (October 2, 2001) *Asian / Latin (October 9, 2001) *Aaron Carter (October 29, 2001) *Cheerleading Camp / Science Camp (December 10, 2001) *Muslim (February 10, 2002) *Country Singer / Rapper (July 14, 2002) *South Dakota / Minnesota (April 29, 2002) *Mother / Daughter & Father / Son (May 6, 2002) =Season 3 (2002‚Äì04)= *Extreme Sports / Traditional Sports (May 13, 2002) *Jock / Music Geek (May 27, 2002) *Rodeo Queen / Beauty Queen (June 2, 2002) *Teen Parent (June 24, 2002) *Body Image (October 13, 2002) *Urban / Rural (January 24, 2003) *NASCAR (February 16, 2003) *Homeless (February 24, 2003) *Spirit / Anti-Spirit (March 6, 2003) *Jordan / America (March 11, 2003) *MC Battle / Debate Team (November 7, 2003) *Living with HIV/AIDS (December 1, 2003) *Girly Girl / Tomboy (April 19, 2004) =Special (2005)= *Katrina's Aftermath (October 18, 2005) Home media The show had three home video releases.

The episode \\"Living with HIV/AIDS\\" was released to VHS in 2003. The episode \\"Muslim\\" was released to DVD in 2005. Reception The series was critically acclaimed. In 2001, Aaron Barnhart of the Albuquerque Journal said that A Walk in Your Shoes \\"might be the best new educational show on TV.\\" Evan Levine of the Newspaper Enterprise Association said that A Walk in Your Shoes \\"can be terrific viewing for preteens and teens ‚Äì especially if you watch with them,\\" calling the show \\"a great opportunity to see glimpses of other people's lives, and to see how other people have misconceptions that are usually broken down.\\" In a review of the episode \\"Muslim,\\" Alexandra Hoyt of Asbury Park Press said that the show \\"is full of touching moments and answers questions that develop insight, knowledge and common bonds.\\" Journalist Rob Owen called the show's religious-themed episodes a welcome and timely change in Nickelodeon's lineup, highlighting its positive depictions of multiple religions as rare for children's television. The San Diego Union-Tribune urged its readers to watch the series, writing: \\"You might want to park the whole family in front of the TV at 8:30. Tune to Nickelodeon and settle in for a half hour that will stay with everyone far longer. The program is A Walk in Your Shoes and it's your heart, not your feet, that is likely to ache when it's over.\\" Nancy Wellons of the Orlando Sentinel called the show an \\"illuminating entry into reality TV\\" for Noggin. SFGates Tim Goodman pointed to A Walk in Your Shoes as an example of Noggin's best programming, calling it \\"thoughtfully produced\\" compared to other tween shows. The episode \\"Living with HIV/AIDS\\" received two awards: a Peabody Award and a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Award. The episode \\"Teen Parent\\" won a Sexual Health in Entertainment Award. The third-season episode \\"NASCAR\\" received a Parents' Choice Silver Award.

After Wegner ruled that √Ångel Pag√°n was out at third on an attempted steal, Piniella, who later acknowledged the call was correct, stormed out of the dugout, threw his hat down, and started kicking dirt on Wegner. Piniella would be ejected and given a four-game suspension and he later apologized to Wegner. =Notable games= On June 28, 2007, Wegner was behind the plate when Toronto Blue Jay Frank Thomas hit his 500th career home run off Minnesota Twins pitcher Carlos Silva.

It is situated in Velagatoor mandal of the district, on the Godavari river. It is located on the bank of the Godavari River, and has a traditional Shiva temple for Hindus, the Koteswara Siddeswara Temple. Archaeological discoveries at Kotilingala indicate that it was an important town in ancient town, during the period of the Assaka mahajanapada and the Satavahanas.  History  Kotilingala has an archaeological site that was excavated by V. V. Krishna Sastry. The site has a mud fort with several gates and running 1054 metres long and 330 metres wide. A watch tower located in the south-eastern corner measures 11.5 * 10.55 m.Material culture of Deccan: with special reference to Satavahana-Ikshvaku period, B.S. R. Babu, Agam Kala Prakashan, Hyderabad, 1999; p. 42 Ancient pottery, beads, bricks querns, and other artifacts have been found at the site. Two hoards of punch-marked coins attributed to 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE have been found at the site. These coins were issued by Gobhada and Samagopa, who are believed to be local pre- Satavahana rulers. Based on these discoveries, Kotilingala is believed to be a town of the ancient Assaka (also Andhra or Ashmaka) mahajanapada. The mud fortification, protected by a stream on its east and the Godavari river on its west, indicate its high political and commercial significance. = Satavahanas = Coins of Satavahana kings have also been found at Kotilingala. A few of these are copper and potin coins bearing the legend \\"Rano Siri Chimuka Satavahanasa\\". Some scholars such as A. M. Sastry and K. D. Bajpai have identified the issuer of these coins with Simuka, who is considered as the founder of the Satavahana dynasty based on the Puranic genealogies. However, others such as P. L. Gupta and I. K. Sarma have disputed this identification, arguing that the Kotilingala coins belonged to a later ruler with a similar or same name. P.V.P. Sastry, who first discovered these coins and attributed them to Simuka in 1978, also changed his view and later stated that Chimuka or Chhimuka of Kotilingala was not same as the Simuka mentioned in Naneghat inscription. Other coins include those issued by Kanha and Satakarni.Indian History, Krishna Reddy; Tata-McGraw Hill Education, New Delhi, 2011. p. A-250 The inscriptions of the early Satavahanas have been found only in present-day Maharashtra (at Nashik and Naneghat), based on which western Deccan has been proposed as the original home of the Satavahanas. However, the discovery of coins at Kotilingala and other sites in present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has prompted some historians such as M. Rama Rao to theorize that the eastern Deccan was also a part of the early Satavahana territory. V. V. Krishna Sastry theorized that the site was once a stronghold of the early Satavahanas. D. R. Reddy and S. Reddy proposed that Kotilingala was the original homeland of the Satavahanas. However, the Satavahana coin samples from Kotilingala are small in size, and it is not known where these coins were minted. S. Chattopadhyaya argues that coins can travel via trade, and this is not conclusive evidence of the early Satavahana presence in eastern Deccan. The archaeological evidence at Kotilingala suggests existence of long-distance trade.  Developments  The State government has decided to construct a protection wall along the shores of river Godavari to protect the site from submergence under the backwaters of the Sripada Yellampalli project. There were transportation facilities to the towns located on the bank of the river Godavari such as Godavarikhani, Jagtial, Mancherial, and Karimnagar.

Their eyes are orangeFemale in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand  Diet  Like other bee-eaters, they predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in flight from perches concealed in foliage. They hunt alone or in pairs, rather than in flocks, and sit motionless for long periods before pursuing their prey.  Behaviour  Like other bee-eaters, they nest in burrows tunnelled into the side of sandy banks, but do not form colonies.

Description Since the early days of jet aircraft and commercial travel, the technique of gradually climbing in cruise altitude as fuel burns off and the aircraft becomes lighter has been widely used by pilots. The altitude that provides the most fuel-efficient cruise (at the desired speed) at the start of a long flight, when the aircraft is fully loaded with fuel, is not the same as the altitude that provides the best efficiency at the end of the flight, when most of the fuel aboard has been burned. This latter altitude is usually significantly higher than the former. By climbing gradually throughout the cruise phase of a flight, pilots can make the most economical use of their fuel. Originally, a simple cruise climb was used by pilots. This amounted to a simple, continuous, very gradual climb from an initial cruise altitude to a final cruise altitude, and made the most efficient use of fuel. However, with increasing air traffic and the assignment of distinct flight levels to specific flights, airways, and directions of flight, it is no longer safe to climb continuously in this way, and so most flights compromise by climbing in distinct steps--a step climb--with ATC approval, in order to ensure that the aircraft is always at an appropriate altitude for traffic control. While not quite as efficient as a continuous cruise climb, step climbs are still more efficient than maintaining a single altitude throughout a flight. The step climb intervals may be , depending on the flight level rules which apply on the particular airway being flown. Where traffic is not an issue, cruise climbs may still be used. Concorde, for example, used a continuous cruise climb throughout its flights, since there was normally never any other traffic at the same altitude (nearly ) in the same direction. In most modern commercial airliners, computers such as flight management systems (FMS) calculate and/or execute the proper steps in a step climb, in order to maximize the efficiency realized by the technique. Step and cruise climbs are not normally applicable to lower-flying aircraft propelled by conventional piston engines with propellers or turboprops, since their performance characteristics may be very different from those of turbofan or jet engined aircraft. In fact, the most efficient altitude for a small general aviation aircraft may be only a some 300-1000 meters (a few thousand feet) above the ground, and increasing altitude may diminish efficiency rather than improve it (propellers tend to lose efficiency in thinner air, and many small general aviation aircraft lack supercharging, effectively decreasing the engine's compression pressure, and therefore efficiency, as the aircraft climbs into more rarified atmosphere). =Informal step climbs= Some pilots use \\"rules of thumb\\" for determining when to perform a step climb. These \\"rules\\" do not consider the effects of different winds at different levels; computerised flight planning systems may be better at height optimisation, and may even include 'step descents' in certain weather conditions. Two of the information rules used by some pilots are: * Keep climbing whenever the aircraft is light enough to climb to the next highest available flight level, until it is time for descent. * If it is possible to stay at the next higher cruise flight level for 20 minutes or more before \\"top of descent\\" (TOD) then it is cost- effective to make the climb.

It bears the date 1665 and is inscribed in Latin with the following inscription (in translation): Pray for the soul of Heward Oxburgh and Clare Oxburgh alias Coghlan who had this made in 1665.  History  Heward Oxburgh was High Sheriff of Offaly (Kings County) and represented the county in the Patriot Parliament summoned by King James II in 1689. The Oxburghs were strong supporters of James II and several officers of the family fought at Derry, Aughrim and the Boyne. Colonel Heward Oxburgh was killed at the Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1691. After the Williamite War the Oxburgh estates were confiscated. Clare Oxburgh made a claim on her late husband‚Äôs property and this helps to establish the donors of the chalice. She belonged to the Coghlan family who also had estates in Offaly and whose lands were confiscated by William of Orange. A synod of the Irish church was held in the townland of Owengallees, Baunbuidhe (Bawnboy) in the parish of Templeport at Pentecost 1669, four years after the Oxburgh Chalice was made.Lynch, De Praesulibus Hiberniae, Vol. I, p. 256. Tradition says that the chalice had been in the possession of a friar named O‚ÄôCoghlan who attended the synod as a representative of a northern Franciscan friary and that this is how the chalice came to Bawnboy. The base of the chalice shows Christ crucified, with a ladder on either side of the cross. There are figures of two animals and a bird that resembles a pelican with its young on its back, being fed with the mother‚Äôs flesh and blood, a symbol for the Eucharist. The chalice is only used on rare occasions. References Sources *Templeport: Rev.

He is the Chairman, Founder & CEO of Fox 40 International, a company best known for manufacturing whistles, and CEO & Chairman of the Fluke Transportation Group, a transportation, warehousing and distribution specialist. Both companies are headquartered in Foxcroft's hometown of Hamilton, Ontario. Foxcroft bought the Fluke Transportation Group and built it from 3 trucks to 176 trucks, 475 trailers and 1.3 million square feet of warehousing. Fluke has the well-known slogan ‚ÄúIF IT‚ÄôS ON TIME‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄôS A FLUKE.‚Äù While working at Fluke, Foxcroft also worked as an NCAA basketball referee. Foxcroft is Canada‚Äôs only NCAA referee. He has also officiated over 1600 international games in 30 countries. Foxcroft often became frustrated with the traditional design of referees' whistles, which features a \\"pea\\" (cork ball) inside that is prone to jamming, thereby preventing the whistle from producing sound. He was inspired to create a \\"pealess\\" whistle following incidents in international games including the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 pre-Olympics game in S√£o Paulo, in which Foxcroft witnessed an obvious foul but he could not stop play as his whistle was rendered useless by a jammed pea; play continued and the referees were booed by spectators. Foxcroft collaborated with an Ontario design consultant, Chuck Shepherd, to design a pealess whistle; they established Fox 40 International in 1987, and the company's whistles were first used at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis. Throughout the 1990s, Fox 40 whistles became the standard whistle for referees and officials in numerous major professional sports leagues including the NFL, CFL, NHL, NCAA and NBA; it has also been adopted as a standard by numerous public safety agencies around the world. Today, Fox 40 International dominates the whistle industry with thousands of whistles produced each day in Canada. Foxcroft has received many awards; he received an Honorary Doctorate from McMaster University, was named Hamilton Distinguished Citizen of the Year, and was inducted into the Hamilton Gallery of Distinction, recipient of the Queen‚Äôs Jubilee Medal. He was named by Profit Magazine as one of the 10 top Canadian entrepreneurs of the decade and inducted into the Burlington Entrepreneur Hall of Fame, the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Hamilton Sports Hall of Fame.

These craters are the lowest known subaerial volcanic vents in the world, at 45 m (150 ft) or more below sea level. In October 2004 the shallow magma chamber beneath Dallol deflated and fed a magma intrusion southwards beneath the rift. A phreatic eruption occurred in January 2011. Numerous hot springs discharge brine and acidic liquid here. Small, widespread, temporary geysers produce cones of salt. The Dallol deposits include significant bodies of potash found directly at the surface. The term Dallol was coined by the Afar people and means dissolution or disintegration, describing a landscape of green acid ponds (pH-values less than 1) and iron oxide, sulfur and salt desert plains.

The effect occurs at lower Reynolds numbers when the ball is rough (such as a golf ball with dimples) than when it is smooth (such as a table tennis ball). In fluid dynamics, drag crisis (also known as the Eiffel paradox) is a phenomenon in which drag coefficient drops off suddenly as Reynolds number increases. This has been well studied for round bodies like spheres and cylinders. The drag coefficient of a sphere will change rapidly from about 0.5 to 0.2 at a Reynolds number in the range of 300000. This corresponds to the point where the flow pattern changes, leaving a narrower turbulent wake. The behavior is highly dependent on small differences in the condition of the surface of the sphere.  History  The drag crisis was observed in 1905 by Nikolay Zhukovsky, who guessed that this paradox can be explained by the detachment of streamlines at different points of the sphere at different velocities. Later the paradox was independently discovered in experiments by Gustave EiffelEiffel G. Sur la r√©sistance des sph√®res dans l'air en mouvement, 1912 and Charles Maurain. Upon Eiffel's retirement, he built the first wind tunnel in a lab located at the basis of the Eiffel Tower, to investigate wind loads on structures and early aircraft. In a series of test he found that the force loading experienced an abrupt decline at a critical Reynolds number. The paradox was explained from boundary-layer theory by German fluid dynamicist Ludwig Prandtl. Reprinted in  Explanation  This transition is associated with a transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer flow adjacent to the object in question. In the case of cylindrical structures this transition is associated with a transition from well organized vortex shedding to randomized shedding behavior for super- critical Reynolds numbers, eventually returning to well organized shedding at the post-critical Reynolds number with a return to elevated drag force coefficients. The super-critical behavior can be described semi-empirically using statistical means or by sophisticated computational fluid dynamics software (CFD) that takes into account the fluid-structure interaction for the given fluid conditions using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) that includes the dynamic displacements of the structure (DLES) [11]. These calculations also demonstrate the importance of the blockage ratio present for intrusive fittings in pipe flow and wind-tunnel tests. The critical Reynolds number is a function of turbulence intensity, upstream velocity profile, and wall-effects (velocity gradients). The semi-empirical descriptions of the drag crisis are often described in terms of a Strouhal bandwidth and the vortex shedding is described by broad-band spectral content.

As the last of the interwar general purpose biplanes, it was used by a number of frontline and Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons. Although the pace of aeronautical development caused its rapid replacement in frontline service, its useful life was extended into the Second World War with many being converted into target tugs and wireless trainers. In 1933 a Westland Wallace became the first aircraft to fly over Everest, as part of the Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition.The Times, 15 February 1933. Design and development In 1931, Westland produced the PV-6, a private-venture development of its successful Wapiti. This updated aircraft embodied a number of improvements including a lengthened fuselage, brakes and wheel spats on the undercarriage and a new engine. By this time both the appearance and performance differed considerably from the standard Wapiti, so the company designated it the \\"PV6 Wallace.\\" Compared with the earlier Wapiti, the Wallace was 20 inches (0.5 m) longer, incorporated an improved undercarriage and was powered by a 655 hp (488 kW) Bristol Pegasus IV engine. The first batches of MK I Wallaces were conversions of Wapitis, a total of 68 powered by 570 bhp (425 kW) Pegasus IIM3 engines. Westland designed an improved version, the Mk II which was fitted with a more powerful engine and the then-novel idea of an enclosed canopy over both crew positions. This offered greater comfort for the crew and improved the rear gunner's aim by protecting him from the slipstream. Three Wallace Is (K4346-K4348) were later converted to Mk II standards, including fitting the closed canopy.  Operational history  Westland Wallace Mk II The original PV-6 prototype, registered G-ACBR (and also known as the Houston-Wallace) along with Westland PV-3 G-ACAZ, was part of the Houston Everest Expedition, named after Lucy, Lady Houston the patron, an attempt to fly over Mount Everest. Both aircraft received modifications that included fitting heating and oxygen equipment, fully enclosing the rear cockpits and using highly supercharged Bristol Pegasus IS 3 engines.James 2008, pp. 22‚Äì23.

Others operated with the Anti-Aircraft Cooperation Flight at RAF Biggin Hill. The last Wallace was completed in October 1936. The first RAF casualties of WW2 occurred when a Wallace of the RAF Observer School (K6028) crashed at Bennachie, near Aberdeen. Pilot Officer Ellard Alexander Cummings (23) from Ottawa, Canada and Leading Aircraftman Alexander Ronald Renfrew Stewart (24) both lost their lives. When withdrawn from the general purpose role, many Wallaces were converted into target tugs. A total of 83 Wallaces remained in service at the beginning of the Second World War.

Life An Irish-Catholic adventurer, Percy arrived in British West Florida in 1775. For services to the Crown (rumored to be as a privateer), he initially received a land grant in Louisiana, near present-day St. Francisville. With that and other land parcels, he established three successful indigo plantations, which enabled him to amass great wealth. He named the main plantation in present-day Wilkinson County near Natchez, Mississippi, Northumberland Place in honor of supposed ties with the fabled British Percy lineage of Hotspur. For a while, Percy was an alcalde, or magistrate, under the Spanish government, hence his nickname, \\"Don Carlos.\\" At the age of 90, Percy reportedly gave in to melancholia (depression) and drowned himself in a local creek, since named Percy's Creek. Family His son, Robert Percy became a highly esteemed military official and owner of the 2,200 Beechwood Plantation. He had received a tenth of Charles Percy's Estate as part of a settlement dispute Robert Percy's daughter Jane married into the prominent Williams family. She married James Cadwallader Williams in 1815. James and Jane Williams son named David Percy Williams of Natchez inherited the Percy/Williams estate and was established as one of the wealthiest men in the Natchez area. David Percy Williams mixed-race son, Archie P. Williams, inherited part of the Percy/Williams Estate from his father, helped pioneer the oil and natural gas industry in Adams County, Mississippi and became a prominent Supervisor of the Third District in the Natchez area. His son, Thomas George Percy, Sr. (Princeton 1806), wed Maria Pope, (a relative of the British poet Alexander Pope) in 1814. Maria's sister Matilda wed John Williams Walker, a Princeton University graduate and one of Alabama's first two senators. Walker and Percy settled on two adjacent estates in Huntsville, Alabama, and named their sons after one another. The sons of Thomas George Percy helped develop the Mississippi Delta into the leading cotton-producing area in the world. William Alexander Percy, the youngest son, became rich before the Civil War and married Nana Armstrong, a cousin of George Armstrong Custer and granddaughter of General James (Trooper) Armstrong, a hero of the War of 1812. Nana's son, William Alexander Percy, became a famed Confederate colonel and was a railroad lawyer after the war. LeRoy Percy (1860‚Äì1929), the son of William Alexander Percy, served as a US senator and confronted the Ku Klux Klan in Washington County in 1922, thwarting their recruiting effort. LeRoy Percy was the father of William Alexander Percy, a World War I hero, lawyer, poet and memoirist, best known for Lanterns on the Levee: Memoirs of a Planter's Son. The senior Percy was the great-uncle of the writer Walker Percy (1916‚Äì1990), who wrote novels and essays; and William Armstrong Percy, III, an historian who became a gay activist beginning in the 1980s.

Draw a plane parallel to the tangent plane and a small distance away from it. Consider the intersection of the surface with this plane. The shape of the intersection is related to the Gaussian curvature. The Dupin indicatrix is the result of the limiting process as the plane approaches the tangent plane. The indicatrix was invented by Charles Dupin. For elliptical points where the Gaussian curvature is positive the intersection will either be empty or form a closed curve. In the limit this curve will form an ellipse aligned with the principal directions. For hyperbolic points, where the Gaussian curvature is negative, the intersection will form a hyperbola. Two different hyperbolas will be formed on either side of the tangent plane. These hyperbolas share the same axis and asymptotes.

Email appending is a controversial practice in the email marketing world, with critics claiming that sending email to people who never explicitly opted-in is against best practices. An email appending process involves either a business or consumer database made up of contacts including their name, address and company name [for business contacts]. If the company wants to expand into email communication, then they can involve a service provider that has a database of email addresses in order to merge the data and append business or consumer email addresses to their existing file. In this way they can have an updated database with the current email address of individuals on the list. The success of email appending depends on the quality of both databases being merged. Like other forms of Database marketing, marketing materials sent using e-pending may be considered spam. Mailers using appending by definition do not have consent of the individuals on their lists, since the individuals did not disclose their email addresses to begin with. Mail sent by appending methods therefore is Opt-out instead of Opt-in e-mail. In September 2011, The Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) released a position paper stating the practice of email appending is in direct violation to their values and is an abusive practice.Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group Position on Email Appending.

Villanueva was a placekicker and punter who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys. Villanueva, who was of Mexican American descent, played college football at New Mexico State University. A news director and broadcasting executive, Villanueva was a co- founder of Univision, a major Spanish-language television network in the United States. Early years Villanueva graduated in 1956 from Calexico Union High School (the Bulldogs) and attended Reedley College, before accepting a scholarship to play college football at New Mexico State University. As a senior, he made 7 out of 8 field goal attempts, including a long one of 47 yards. He was part of the teams that won back to back Sun Bowl games in 1959 and 1960, as well as going undefeated his senior season. These were significant accomplishments, considering that more than 50 years have passed without another postseason appearance for the New Mexico State University football teams. In 1970, he was inducted into the New Mexico State University Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional NFL career =Los Angeles Rams= Villanueva was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Los Angeles Rams after the 1960 NFL Draft, becoming one of the earliest players of Mexican descent in the NFL, and one of the last straight-away style placekickers. Villanueva was both a placekicker and a punter, so he kept two different pairs of shoes on game day. During his time with the Rams he was nicknamed \\"El Kickador\\" and \\"El Toe-reador\\", with bullfighting music being played whenever he walked onto the field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. In 1962, he led the NFL in punting, set the Rams' record for the longest field goal (51 yards) and the single-season record for punting average (45.5), which lasted for 45 years until it was broken in 2007 by Donnie Jones. In 1963, he ranked third in the NFL in punting with a 45.4-yard average. He led the team in scoring from 1960 to 1963, until Bruce Gossett won the placekicker starting job in 1964. On May 14, 1966, the Rams traded him to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for wide receiver and future hall of famer Tommy McDonald. He left as the Rams career gross average punting leader with 44.3 yards, a record that was broken by Donnie Jones in 2009. =Dallas Cowboys= In 1965, he had an instant impact improving the special teams unit, eventually setting the franchise record with 100 consecutive extra point conversions (1965‚Äì1967). In 1966, he ranked second in the league in scoring, with a career-high 107 points, while setting the Cowboys record for most extra points made without a miss in a season with 56. Villanueva retired after the 1967 NFL Championship Game famously known as \\"The Ice Bowl\\". He finished with a 42.8 career punting average without a block and 491 career points. Major League Soccer =L.A. Galaxy= Danny Villanueva, Jr. was a co-founder of the L.A. Galaxy franchise in Major League Soccer. He was Galaxy's first president, during his presidency, Galaxy reached the MLS Cup final in 1996. He served as president and general manager until 1998 when Anschutz Entertainment Group purchased the team and Tim Leiweke took over as club president. Personal life Villanueva went on to become a self-made multimillionaire. He started as a sports broadcaster on KNBC in Los Angeles, California. In the 1970s he became part-owner of the Spanish International Network (SIN), a Spanish-language network based in the United States with stations located in cities across the US with significant Spanish language populations. In 1986, the network was sold and renamed to Univision. Villanueva launched the annual \\"Navidad en el Barrio\\" telethon in 1971 to raise money for toys and food for needy Hispanic families in Southern California during the Christmas season, which was televised annually in December from 1971 to the early 1990s on KMEX-TV. In 1990, he launched the annual Fiesta Broadway Cinco de Mayo celebration which takes place in downtown Los Angeles. In 1988, he was inducted into the National Hispanic Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural group. In 2003 the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences inducted him into the Management Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural group. In 2007, he was inducted into the Hispanic Sports Foundation for Education Inc.'s National Hispanic Hall Of Fame. He died after a stroke in 2015. He was married to Myrna Schmidt, with whom he had two sons Daniel L. and Jim. His brother, Primo Villanueva, was one of the first Hispanic surnamed players in the Canadian Football League (CFL). He died on June 18, 2015.

Early life Boyd was born into an aristocratic British family, and served as a pageboy at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was educated at Bradfield College and King's College, Cambridge and was commissioned into the Irish Guards in 1946. He served with them until 1948, including a spell in Palestine. Personal life Boyd married Diana Mary Gibson in 1954 but the marriage was dissolved in 1970.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 20 March 2009 Gibson died in 1975. He married for a second time, in 1977. His new wife, Hilary Bardwell (\\"Hilly\\"), had been married twice before: first to Kingsley Amis (with whom she had three children: Philip Amis, the novelist Martin Amis, and Sally Amis), and later to D. R. Shackleton Bailey. Boyd and Bardwell had one son, James Charles Edward Boyd, known as \\"Jaime,\\" who was born in 1972. After the end of Kingsley Amis's second marriage, he came to live with Lord Kilmarnock and his ex-wife Hilly. Boyd lived for much of his life at Ronda in Andalusia, first with Diana, and later with Hilly and their son James, where he variously ran a tapas bar and a language school. As Boyd's only son was born before his parents' marriage, the title of Baron Kilmarnock was inherited by Boyd's younger brother, Robin Jordan Boyd (b. 1941), who succeeded to the peerage in 2009. He has two sons, Simon John Boyd, born 1978, and Mark Julian Boyd, born 1981. The heir apparent is the elder of his two sons, Simon John Boyd, who has a son, Lucian Michael Boyd (born 2007). Political career After inheriting his father's title in 1975, he took his seat in the House of Lords, eventually joining the Social Democratic Party.

Konzo was first described by Giovanni Trolli in 1938 who compiled the observations from eight doctors working in the Kwango area of the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). Signs and symptoms The onset of paralysis (spastic paraparesis) is sudden and symmetrical and affects the legs more than the arms. The resulting disability is permanent but does not progress. Typically, a patient is standing and walking on the balls of the feet with rigid legs and often with ankle clonus. Initially, most patients experience generalized weakness during the first days and are bedridden for some days or weeks before trying to walk. Occasional blurred vision and/or speech difficulties typically clear during the first month, except in severely affected patients. Spasticity is present from the first day, without any initial phase of flaccidity. After the initial weeks of functional improvement, the spastic paraparesis remains stable for the rest of life. Some patients may suffer an abrupt aggravating episode, e.g. a sudden and permanent worsening of the spastic paraparesis. Such episodes are identical to the initial onset and can therefore be interpreted as a second onset. The severity of konzo varies; cases range from only hyperreflexia in the lower limbs to a severely disabled, bedridden patient with spastic paraparesis, associated weakness of the trunk and arms, impaired eye movements, speech and possibly visual impairment. Although the severity varies from patient to patient, the longest upper motor neurons are invariably more affected than the shorter ones. Thus, a konzo patient with speech impairment always shows severe symptoms in the legs and arms. Recently, neuropsychological effects of konzo have been described from DR Congo. Cause The character of the neurological injury is not clear. The disease onset is associated with high intake of cyanide from a diet of mostly bitter cassava, which is low in protein, particularly sulfur amino acids. These are essential for the detoxification in the body of cyanide to thiocyanate, which is removed in the urine. A number of studies implicate the combination of high cyanide intake from bitter cassava and low intake of sulfur amino acids as the cause. It has now been shown that the month by month incidence of konzo is significantly correlated with the percentage of children with high urinary thiocyanate content, which is a measure of their cyanide intake. The importance of an adequate supply of protein sulfur amino acids is shown from three unrelated konzo epidemics in Mozambique, Tanzania and DRC. People of the same ethnic group living only 5 km away from those with konzo had near zero konzo prevalence, because in Mozambique they lived near the sea, in Tanzania they lived near Lake Victoria and had access to fish and in DRC they lived near the forest and had access to animal protein. The dose‚Äìresponse relationship between konzo incidence and cyanide intake, together with the prevention of konzo in many villages by reducing cyanide intake from cassava (see below) and the importance of sulfur amino acids in prevention of konzo, shows that konzo is very likely due to high cyanide/low sulfur amino acid intake in a diet of bitter cassava. Konzo does not occur unless these conditions are met, which occurs only in remote villages in six tropical African countries. The total number of reported cases up to 2009 was 6788, but most cases are never reported and there was an estimate of 100,000 cases in DRC alone in 2002. Konzo is spreading geographically as cassava is being grown in new areas where there is little knowledge of processing methods to remove cyanogens. Konzo epidemics occur due to war which causes disruption of life in poor villages and drought, when the plant increases the cyanogen content of roots 2‚Äì4 times and the cyanide content of cassava flour also increases greatly. Konzo is also endemic in certain areas. Traditional methods of processing cassava to remove cyanogens consist of sun drying and heap fermentation in East Africa, which are inadequate in removal of cyanogens even in a year of normal rainfall. In Central Africa soaking (retting) of cassava roots in water for 4‚Äì5 days is adequate, but short soaking for 1‚Äì2 days leaves large amounts of cyanogens in flour and leads to konzo. In West Africa a roasted product called garri is produced by a different method than that used to produce flour, which reduces the total cyanide content to 10‚Äì20 ppm. There are no reported cases of konzo west of Cameroon. However another neurological disease called tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN), occurs amongst older people in West Africa (including south- west Nigeria, and also Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, West Indies and South India) and is probably due to long term intake of cyanogens from cassava at a lower level than that needed to cause konzo. Diagnosis The WHO has recommended three criteria for the diagnosis of konzo: * a visible symmetric spastic abnormality of gait while walking or running; * a history of onset of less than one week followed by a non-progressive course in a formerly healthy person; * bilaterally exaggerated knee or ankle jerk reflexes without signs of disease of the spine. Depending on its severity, konzo is divided into three categories: mild when individuals are able to walk without support, moderate when individuals need one or two sticks to walk, and severe when the affected person is unable to walk unsupported. =Differential diagnosis= The clinical symptoms are strikingly similar to those of lathyrism and also similar to tropical spastic paraparesis and hereditary spastic paraparesis, only that the latter two disorders have a slow onset. Konzo is distinct from polio which is a flaccid paralysis and most often affects a person asymmetrically. Konzo is one of several tropical neuropathies. A distinct myeloneuropathy also associated to cyanogen intake from cassava is tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN), as first described in parts of Nigeria by B. O. Osuntokun in 1968. The disease is still occurring in the same areas. Prevention Konzo can be prevented by use of the \\"wetting method,\\" which is used to remove residual cyanogens from cassava flour, as an additional processing method. Cassava flour is placed in a bowl and the level marked on the inside of the bowl. Water is added with mixing until the height of the wet flour comes up to the mark. The wet flour is placed in a thin layer on a mat for 2 hours in the sun or 5 hours in the shade to allow the escape of hydrogen cyanide produced by the breakdown of linamarin by the enzyme linamarase. The damp flour is then cooked in boiling water in the traditional way to produce a thick porridge called ‚Äúfufu‚Äù or ‚Äúugali‚Äù, which is flavoured by some means such as a sauce. The wetting method is accepted by rural women because it requires little extra work or equipment and produces fufu which is not bitter, because the bitter tasting linamarin has gone. In 2010 the wetting method was taught to the women in Kay Kalenge village, Popokabaka Health Zone, Bandundu Province, DRC, where there were 34 konzo cases. The women used the method and during the intervention there were no new konzo cases and the urinary thiocyanate content of the school children fell to safe levels. Konzo had been prevented for the first time ever in the same health zone in which it had first been discovered by Dr Trolli in 1938. Fourteen months after the intervention ceased the village was visited again. It was found that there were no new cases of konzo, the school children had low urinary thiocyanate levels, the wetting method was still being used and it had spread by word of mouth to three nearby villages. It is important to teach the women that konzo is due to a poison present in their food, to get them to regularly use the wetting method and posters are available in 13 different languages as a teaching aid as an additional method to remove residual cyanogens. The wetting method has now been used in 13 villages in the DRC with a collective population of nearly 10,000 people. The time of the intervention has been reduced from 18 months in the first intervention, to 12 months in the second intervention, to 9 months in the third and fourth interventions. This has reduced the cost per person of the intervention to prevent konzo by removing cyanogens from cassava flour, to $16 per person. This targeted method to reduce cyanide intake is much cheaper and more effective in preventing konzo than broad based interventions. Prognosis Although no treatment has been found it has been shown that affected individuals benefit considerably from rehabilitation and use of adequate walking aids. In the Central African Republic some children have been operated with an elongation of the Achilles tendon which improved the position of the foot but the long term consequence remains uncertain. Epidemiology Konzo has been reported in outbreaks mainly among women and children in remote rural populations in DR Congo, Mozambique (where it is known as mantakassa), Tanzania, Central African Republic, Cameroon and Angola. The first reported outbreak occurred in Bandundu Province in present-day DR Congo in 1936‚Äì1937 and the second in Nampula Province of Northern Mozambique in 1981. Each of these outbreaks numbered more than 1000 cases. Familial clustering is common. Outbreaks typically occur in the dry season in households living in absolute poverty that have sustained themselves for weeks or months on insufficiently processed bitter cassava. Both smaller outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported from all the countries above. Etymology \\"Konzo\\" means \\"tied legs\\" in the Yaka language in Southwestern DR Congo and was the designation by the first affected population in DR Congo as reported by Dr G. Trolli in 1938. The name, taken up by Hans Rosling and colleagues, aptly describes the typical spastic gait of those afflicted.

He is also credited by al-Fadl's testimony with a 1992 fatwa issued at the request of Al Qaeda leadership, described as pivotal in al-Qaeda's development as it provided the group with justification for the killing of Muslim civilians and bystanders in the course of killing Americans and other non-Muslim enemies. The fatwa is putatively based on one by the influential 14th-century Salafi scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (\\"Ibn al Tamiyeh\\") permitting the killing of Muslim supporters of the \\"Tartars\\" (Mongols) who threatened to invade the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. In testimony al-Fadl was asked: > Q. Can you tell us now what Abu Hajer al Iraqi said about Ibn al Tamiyeh? > A. He said that our time now is similar like in that time, and he say Ibn > al Tamiyeh, when a tartar come to Arabic war, Arabic countries that time, he > say some Muslims, they help them.

Feller Feller, William, An Introduction to Probability Theory And Its Applications, Third Edition, Wiley, 1968, Chapter VI, section 8 says that the problem was inspired by a humorous reference to Banach's smoking habit in a speech honouring him by Hugo Steinhaus, but that it was not Banach who set the problem or provided an answer. Suppose a mathematician carries two matchboxes at all times: one in his left pocket and one in his right. Each time he needs a match, he is equally likely to take it from either pocket. Suppose he reaches into his pocket and discovers for the first time that the box picked is empty. If it is assumed that each of the matchboxes originally contained N matches, what is the probability that there are exactly k matches in the other box? Solution Without loss of generality consider the case where the matchbox in his right pocket has an unlimited number of matches and let M be the number of matches removed from this one before the left one is found to be empty. When the left pocket is found to be empty, the man has chosen that pocket (N+1) times. Then M is the number of successes before (N+1) failures in Bernoulli trials with p=1/2, which has the negative binomial distribution and thus :P[M=m] = \\\\binom{N+m}{m}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^{N+1+m}. Returning to the original problem, we see that the probability that the left pocket is found to be empty first is P[M which equals 1/2 because both are equally likely. We see that the number K of matches remaining in the other pocket is :P[K=k] = P[M=N-kM. The expectation of the distribution is approximately 2\\\\sqrt{N/\\\\pi}-1. (This is shown using Stirling's approximation.Feller, page 238.) So starting with boxes with N=40 matches, the expected number of matches in the second box is 6.

It was adapted from the 1950 German novel Unruhige Nacht by Albrecht Goes. It was the first collaboration between director Rudolph Cartier and writer Nigel Kneale, who were both, according to television historian Lez Cooke, \\"responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s.\\" Plot Based on an incident from Goes's own experiences during World War II, the action of the story takes place over one night on the Eastern Front in Russia in 1943. A German Army pastor has been flown in to oversee the military execution of a convicted deserter. The pastor finds himself sharing a room with an officer who is due to be sent to fight with the German Sixth Army in the Battle of Stalingrad, virtually a death sentence itself. Through studying documentation surrounding the case, the pastor comes to realise that the deserter is in fact innocent, but his execution goes ahead as scheduled in the morning. The officer, however, earns a temporary reprieve as news comes through that the Sixth Army has fallen and the battle for Stalingrad has ended in defeat. Production Rudolph Cartier had joined the staff of the BBC drama department earlier in 1952, after previously having worked in the film industry. Arrow to the Heart was his first television production for the BBC. The Austrian-born Cartier adapted Goes's novel into script form himself, as well as directing the production. The BBC's Head of Drama, Michael Barry, felt that Cartier's English dialogue was not quite right, and assigned Nigel Kneale -- a staff writer who had been working at the BBC since the previous year -- to improve it, with Cartier's approval. Officially credited for \\"additional dialogue\\", this was Kneale's first major television drama credit. The drama starred Robert Harris, Howard Lang, Esmond Knight, Leonard White and Donald Pleasence, and was transmitted live from 9‚Äì10.40pm on the evening of Sunday 20 July 1952. It was performed live for a second time four days later, from 7.25‚Äì9.15pm on Thursday 24 July 1952. Cartier remade the production, working from the original script, four years later. Transmitted on Sunday 22 April 1956, this version was also still transmitted live. Robert Harris reprised his starring role, with Cyril Shaps also appearing. The Times newspaper reviewed the production the day after its broadcast, and gave it a favourable assessment. \\"Mr. Rudolph Cartier's production, though soliciting the emotions blatantly with Wagner, caught numerous atmospheres by dramatic cutting and economic precision of detail (a terrified filing clerk in the background upsetting a loaded shelf).\\" Routine telerecording was rare in 1952, and neither of the two transmissions would have benefited from the practice, which then gave poor visual results; this is partly the reason for the 'live repeat'. No recording of the 1956 production is known to survive either.See the relevant lostshows.com page.

Biography =Early life= Dohler was born in Baltimore, Maryland. When he was a child, his mother bought him a film projector and one day he drew stick figures on a piece of scotch tape. He ran the tape through the projector and just before the tape burned up inside of the projector, he saw the animated figure dance on the wall and that's when he knew he wanted to make films. =Publishing =  WILD and ProJunior  In 1961 at the age of 15, Dohler started a Mad-style fanzine called WILD. Mad had Alfred E. Neuman as a mascot, so Dohler used his middle-school creation, Pro Junior, as WILD‚Äôs mascot. In WILD‚Äôs peak it had contributors such as Jay Lynch, Art Spiegelman, and Skip Williamson, who later went on to be famous in the underground comix movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the early 1970s Jay Lynch and Art Spiegelman were fooling around and they started drawing WILD‚Äôs mascot, ProJunior, again, but this time in a leopard skin leotard.Knudde, Kjell. \\"Don Dohler,\\" Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed June 4, 2018. Robert Crumb saw ProJunior and decided to draw a comic about him. As a result, Lynch rounded up 22 underground comix artists, including Dohler, to draw their own interpretation of ProJunior, which was published by Kitchen Sink Press in a comic in 1971. Cinemagic In the mid 1960s Dohler came up with an idea for a magazine for filmmakers. It would feature illustrated step-by-step articles for amateur special effects filmmakers. Inspired by his underground comix friends, Dohler set off to publish the magazine on his own. Cinemagic featured articles by industry professionals and went on for 11 issues before being purchased by Starlog in 1979. Cinemagic inspired several young filmmakers who later went on to have successful careers in Hollywood, including J. J. Abrams, Tom Sullivan, Ernie Farino, Michael Trcic and Al Magliochetti.  Other projects  Fresh off the success of Cinemagic and his own burgeoning filmmaking career, Dohler wrote two books in 1979-1980: Film Magic: The Fantastic Guide to Special Effects Filmmaking (Cinema Enterprises, 1979) and the two-volume Stop Motion Animation: A Complete Step- By-Step Guide (Cinema Enterprises, 1980). In the 1990s, he returned to publishing, putting out Amazing Cinema and Movie Club magazines. He supplemented his income at various times as editor of the (Baltimore county) Times-Herald and as editor of the Harford Business Ledger. = Filmmaking = Dohler's first film, the science fiction B movie The Alien Factor, was released in 1976. The story begins with a young teenage couple making out in a car when an insect-looking monster attacks. The local sheriff must find out what's causing the killings while the mayor is breathing down his neck to keep a lid on the deaths so a multimillion-dollar amusement park can be built nearby. Featuring special effects from Ernest Farino, John Cosentino, and Larry Schelecter, The Alien Factor had a long run on TV throughout the 1980s, including on Ted Turner's Superstation WPCH-TV.Piepenburg, Erik. \\"Big Hair and Bad Blood: VHS-Era Horror Obscurities From A to Z,\\" The New York Times (OCTOBER 26, 2011). Dohler made several more low-budget films during the 1980s, including The Galaxy Invader, Nightbeast, Blood Massacre and Fiend, a serial killer film with a supernatural twist. After an eleven-year self- imposed hiatus, Dohler returned to filmmaking with Alien Rampage, where Dohler met actor/cop Joe Ripple. Dohler never cared for directing, so he asked Ripple to direct his films, and he concentrated on cinematography and editing. Together they made five films, including Harvesters, Stakes, Vampire Sisters, Crawler and Dead Hunt. =Later life and death= Dohler died from cancer in Maryland in 2006; he was 60 years old.

Seer was laid down on 28 November 1941 by the American Ship Building Company of Lorain, Ohio. Launched on 23 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J.P. Conley, and commissioned on 21 October 1942, Commander Albert F. Block, USNR, in command. Service history =US East Coast, 1942-1943= Following commissioning, Seer proceeded from the Great Lakes to Chesapeake Bay for shakedown; then commenced minesweeping, anti-submarine patrol, and coastal escort work in the 5th Naval District. In April 1943, her division, Mine Division (MinDiv) 16, joined Task Force 68 at Tompkinsville, New York; whence, on the 5th, she got underway to escort a convoy to North Africa. =Invasion of Sicily and Italy, 1943= By the end of the month, the convoy had reached Gibraltar. During May and June as the forces scheduled to participate in Operation \\"Husky\\" ‚Äî the invasion of Sicily ‚Äî gathered in Algerian and Tunisian harbors ‚Äî Seer, now a unit of the 8th Amphibious Force's Escort-Sweeper group, escorted ships to Bizerte, Oran, Ghazaouet, and Sousse; and patrolled off these ports. On 6 July, she joined the \\"Joss\\" attack force; and, on the 9th, she departed for Sicily. The next morning, she arrived off Licata; and, as the 3rd Infantry Division went ashore, she patrolled on a line four miles off \\"Red Beach\\". On the 11th, she was en route back to Bizerte to join another landing craft convoy and escort it to southern Sicily. By the end of the month, she had brought up another convoy, and Palermo had fallen. In August, she began escorting ships to that port. As the ships offloaded, she added her armament to that protecting the harbor and covering the push to Messina. By mid-month, she had completed a second Bizerte-Palermo run; and, on the 17th, as Messina fell, she was caught in an air raid and took a small shell or small fragmentation bomb near the after 3-inch gun. Eight of her crew were injured; but, by the 19th, she was back at Palermo, whence she proceeded to Licata, Bizerte, and then to Mers El K√©bir to prepare for the invasion of the Italian mainland at Salerno. A unit of Task Force 81, she entered Salerno Bay on 8 September and commenced sweeping the transport area. Through the 11th, she continued sweeping despite interruptions during dive bombing attacks; then, until the 16th, she performed patrol duties. For the next 10 days, she alternated Sicily-to-Salerno convoy duty with patrol work; and, on the 26th, she cleared the area to return to North Africa. Repairs alongside followed; and, in mid-October, she resumed escort work with runs to Naples. =Invasion of Southern France, 1944= Seer continued to escort merchant ship and amphibious convoys to Italy into the summer of 1944 when she joined the forces assigned to Operation \\"Dragoon,\\" the landings in southern France. Departing Naples on 12 August, she moved toward the French coast; and, during the pre- dawn hours of the 15th, commenced sweeping the boat lanes leading to \\"Red Beach\\" on the Baie de Cavalaire. Further sweeping operations in the assault area and off Toulon and Marseille followed; and, for almost a month, she escaped damage from German mines and coastal guns. On 10 September, however, she struck a moored contact mine in the Rade d'Hy√®res. Three were killed, 20 injured. Hull and engine damage was severe. Emergency repairs were performed at Toulon by the Royal Navy repair ship HM LSE-2; and, on 20 September, she was taken in tow by fleet tug for Palermo. Further temporary repairs were completed there on 9 November, when she started back to the United States. =Return to the United States= Sailing via Bizerte and Oran, Seer arrived at Yorktown, Virginia, on 11 December and began repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard on the 14th. By mid-March 1945, the work was completed, and the minesweeper conducted a series of tests off the Virginia coast for the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. During April, she operated off southern Florida. =Pacific Fleet, 1945-1947 = In early May, she transited the Panama Canal en route to Pearl Harbor where she rejoined her division, now assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Flagship of the division, Seer remained in Hawaiian waters until after the end of the war. On 17 August, she headed west to participate in postwar minesweeping operations off Japan, Formosa, and the China coast. On 15 January 1946, she departed Sasebo for the United States and inactivation. She arrived at San Pedro on 14 February; remained on the west coast into November; then got underway for Orange, Texas, where she was decommissioned on 26 April 1947 and berthed with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. =Korean War, 1950-1955 = After the outbreak of the Korean War, Seer was ordered reactivated. Recommissioned on 8 November 1950, she joined MinDiv 8 and for the remainder of the war performed training and schoolship duties out of Charleston, South Carolina, conducting periodic tours at Mayport and Panama City, Florida. In January 1954, she returned to the Mediterranean for a four- month tour with the 6th Fleet. At the end of May, she returned to Charleston to resume operations from that port and from Panama City. On 6 January 1955, however, she departed Charleston to return to the inactive fleet. =Decommissioning and sale= Reclassified MSF-112 on 7 February 1955, four days later she was decommissioned and berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida. The ship was reclassified as a Coastal Minelayer, MMC-5, on 31 October 1958. The conversion to a coastal minelayer began in Norway in September 1960, and was completed in September 1962. The ship was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy on 15 December 1962 and renamed KNM Uller (N 50). Seer was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1963. Seer earned six battle stars during World War II.

The union has consistently fought for improved pay, benefits, and job security for its members, and it has resisted efforts to vary teacher pay based on performance evaluations. It has also pushed for improvements in the Chicago schools, and since its inception argued that its activities benefited students as well as teachers.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), pp. 3‚Äì4. \\"In addition to the issue of unionization, scholars have debated whether teachers joined unions to pursue monetary gains or to reform the public schools. Since teachers founded the AFT in 1916, the organization has portrayed itself as a union fighting for better salaries and benefits for its members and improvements in the public schools. Indeed, teachers' unions across the land asserted that they wanted improved pay and conditions for teachers in order to provide quality education for the students.\\" The CTU united several teachers' organizations in Chicago in the wake of a teachers' revolt against banks during the Great Depression. It was chartered in 1937 as Local 1 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), in which it played a founding role. It was the largest and most active AFT Local until the 1960s.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), pp. 1‚Äì2. \\"In the early years of the twentieth century, the center of teacher unionism was found in Chicago. [...] The CTU attracted a majority of Chicago teachers and remained the largest and most influential AFT local until the 1960s.\\" The CTU won collective bargaining rights in 1966 and conducted several strikes during the 1970s and 1980s. In September 2012, the union began its first strike in 25 years. The CTU is also affiliated with the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the Chicago Federation of Labor, and the AFL- CIO. It has more than 25,000 members. Current officers come from the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators, elected in 2010 to replace the longstanding United Progressive Caucus. From that point until her 2018 retirement, Karen Lewis was president. Through a successors election the new officer slate became: President Jesse Sharkey, Vice President Stacy Davis Gates, Recording Secretary Michael Brunson and Financial Secretary Maria Moreno. Origins =Chicago Teachers Federation= The CTU originated from the Chicago Teachers Federation (CTF), an organization of women elementary school teachers founded in 1897. In its first few years, it ran a successful campaign to increase teacher pay, and its membership grew to 2500. In 1900, the CTF elected Catherine Goggin and Margaret Haley as its officers, deciding to pay them the same wages as those made by teachers. 262x262px Under the leadership of Haley and Goggin, the CTF struggled for women's suffrage, for women's rights within the labor movement, and for the right of woman workers to earn as much as their male counterparts.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 7. \\"With two-thirds of the teaching workforce female, teacher unionism was firmly located in the context of women's work and women's struggles to enhance the status and rewards of teaching. For most of this century, boards of education denied female teachers equal pay with men, the right to marry, and access to leadership positions in the schools. In Chicago, female elementary school teachers used the union as a vehicle to campaign for equal pay with high school teachers.\\" The CTF also launched a successful campaign against corporate tax evasion, the compensation for which was used to pay back salaries upon which the city had reneged. In 1902, the CTF joined the Chicago Federation of Labor (CFL). It was the first time that a teachers' group had affiliated with a larger labor organization.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 22. In 1916, Haley and the CTF helped to found the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), in which the CTF became Local 1. However, the Chicago Board of Education, led by Jacob Loeb, had recently passed a rule against teacher unions: > Membership by teachers in labor unions or in organizations of teachers > affiliated with a trade union or a federation or association of trade > unions, as well as teachers' organizations which have officers, business > agents, or other representatives who are not members of the teaching force, > is inimical to proper discipline, prejudicial to the efficiency of the > teaching force, and detrimental to the welfare of the public school system. > Therefore, such membership, affiliation, or representation is hereby > prohibited. This rule, which became known as the Loeb rule, further stated that teachers would be fired unless they stated in writing that they did not belong to any such organization. The Loeb rule allowed the city to fire 68 teachers, including the CTF leadership, who refused to leave the union. By 1917, the CTF was forced to withdraw from both the CFL and the AFT. Subsequent passage of the Otis rule placed education in the hands of a centralized Board of Education. However, the board was still appointed by city politicians. In the coming years, the city and School Board were accused of rampant corruption, particularly in connection with two-time mayor William Hale Thompson.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 12. \\"At no time was this political control of Chicago public education more apparent than under the regime of Republican mayor William H. Thompson. Mayor of the city from 1915 to 1923 and again from 1927 to 1931, Thompson had connections with organized crime and presided over some of the worst political corruption in Chicago's history.\\" Many CPS employees were appointed by the Mayor, and a 1931 study found that Chicago spent more money than any other major city on operations costs outside of education.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 13. The proliferation of bureaucracy was a serious concern: when the Elementary Teachers Union formed in 1928, one of its stated goals was \\"freeing of teachers from the increasingly intolerable burden of red tape and clerical work.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 21. = Great Depression = Chicago teachers became exceptionally militant during the Great Depression, when teachers and many of their students faced extreme poverty and miserable school conditions.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 9. \\"Chicago was one of the only cities in the Great Depression where public school teachers actively challenged the policies of school authorities and built a united teachers' organization, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU). Although divided by gender, ethnicity, and religion and between lowered paid elementary and higher paid high school teachers, still more than two-thirds of the teachers joined the CTU, making it the largest teachers union in the country.\\" Particularly in the inner city, classrooms were undersupplied and overcrowded. \\"Too many city classrooms still resemble enlarged prison cells,\\" according to a 1931 report.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 20. The city neglected to pay its teachers on 37 out of 46 paydays. Teachers also claimed of egregious class sizes and poorly maintained schools. Most stayed in the classroom teaching, although one committed suicide. Teachers organized independently to procure food and clothing for their students, giving large sums from their own shrinking paychecks.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 32‚Äì33. \\"To alleviate the suffering of the Depression, teachers organized committees within schools to collect and distribute money and clothing to the poorer students and served breakfast to hungry children. During the school year of 1930‚Äì31, the teachers of Chicago contributed more than $112,000 for food and clothing for their students. Yet teachers agonized because they could not contribute more to student financial welfare.\\" Contested municipal reforms Once again, supporters of the public schools (including Haley) launched a campaign against local tax dodgers, who they said had owed taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new construction.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 29. \\"Additionally, local politicians and assessors throughout the 1920s failed to tax major property holders and large corporations. Between 1915 and 1925, as Chicago's population increased by 28 percent and there was unprecedented new construction in the city worth some $200 million a year, the official assessed valuation of property increased by only $29 million per annum.\\" This time, business leaders retaliated, in February 1932 forming a group called the Citizen's Committee on Public Expenditures (CCPE), which pushed the city to cut its education budget. The banks, which controlled millions of dollars worth of city tax anticipation warrants, announced (and possessed) de facto control over city policy. In a statement published in the Saturday Evening Post, railroad president and CCPE secretary Fred Sargent wrote that banks \\"positively will not lend money for any municipal function which does not have our active support. This has been a powerful lever in dealing with the really small number of recalcitrants in public office who still cling to a faith in a Santa Claus.\\" And: \\"business men of Chicago have learned their lesson. We shall not again let the mechanism run wild.\\". Partly quoted in Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 30. Sargent also advocated an end to income taxes. Sargent and the CCPE were accused of \\"financial fascism\\" for taking control of the city government through financial blackmail \\"with little regard for the needs of the masses and their children.\\" Teachers unhappy Teachers, with support from students and parents, began an escalating campaign to restore funding to the schools and paychecks to the teachers. They believed that Chicago's banks had access to millions of dollars in unpaid taxes that might balance the city's budget; they were angry about the CCPE's explicitly anti-school agenda, and they were also provoked by a $90 million bank bailout from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation that did nothing to help the schools. More generally, teachers were alarmed by an apparent corporate attack on education; they believed that the nation's ruling class wanted to dismantle education for the public and reserve it only for the wealthy.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 36‚Äì37. \\"Teachers began to express the idea that they were defending democracy and the public education system from self-serving business and political elites. Reflecting a general public optimism with the promise of education, teachers viewed the schools as avenues for social mobility and bulwarks of a more democratic society. [...] Many teachers believed there was a nationwide plot by people of power and wealth to cripple public education and to restrict schooling to those who could afford it.\\" Protests and petitions mounted from 1931‚Äì1932. Students planned a solidarity demonstration, and although many were convinced to stay in school, 13,000 students actually walked out. Teachers became frustrated with union leaders who urged restraint for the teachers and argued amongst each other; new rank-and-file organizations emerged. Historian John F. Lyons describes these groups as key in the development of solidarity among the city's teachers: > Many began to see the weak and divided position of the unions as the main > reason for lack of success in the dispute. Accordingly, between 1931 and > 1933, ordinary teachers founded a number of temporary groups to unify their > ranks and actively pursue their demands.

Three more rank-and-file > teachers' organizations emerged in 1932: The Civic Education Association of > Chicago, initially organized by teachers from Senn High School on the North > Side, aimed \\"to bring all of the teachers of Chicago, organized and > unorganized, into one effective unit.\\" The Chicago Teacher Voter Association > set out with the sole aim of campaigning for politicians sympathetic to the > teachers' plight. The South Side Teachers called for a boycott of stores, > hotels, and other businesses that had participated in the tax strike.Lyons, > Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 35‚Äì36. Teachers increasingly began to feel singled out for bad treatment by the city. This feeling was amplified in March 1933 when teachers learned that, as teacher pay was being further cut by 15%, school janitors had received a secret raise. The city announced furthermore that on the next pay day all municipal employees except teachers would be paid.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 38. Teachers revolt In April 1933, teachers targeted banks in the downtown Loop, which they held \\"financially responsible\\" for the $30 million deficit in teacher payments. On April 24, 1933 (the beginning of spring break), thousands of teachers entered bank offices and began causing mayhem. They chanted \\"Pay us! Pay us!\\" At City National Bank, they chanted \\"We want Dawes! We Want Dawes!\\", referring to bank chairman and recent US vice president Charles G. Dawes. Dawes appeared, surrounded by guards, and attempted to appease the mob over shouts. Police, who had also experienced a number of payless paydays, were reluctant to interfere. Teachers conducted more 'raids' on 27 April, demanding of bankers: \\"Pay your taxes!\\" and \\"We want food!\\" After joining city meetings en masse, they proceeded to the Chicago Title and Trust Company, which held $10 million of property taxes in escrow. President Holman Pettibone spoke to the crowd from a second-story window and attempted to convince them that the company owed nothing to the city. (In fact, Chicago Title and Trust did possess $10 million of unpaid property tax money, held in escrow accounts for tax evaders; Pettibone argued that the bank could not legitimately hand them over to the city.) Here, they clashed directly with police and bankers; several teachers were beaten and a large plate-glass window was broken. The National Education Association telegraphed bankers directly, threatening to move the organization's convention (with its 10,000 attendees) away from Chicago‚Äîa potential blow for the upcoming World's Fair.) In early May, bankers agreed to buy tax anticipation warrants from the city. (Practically, this meant the banks were loaning the city money.) Bankers issued a collective statement suggesting that further demonstrations from teachers would provoke them to reverse their decision. Mayor Edward J. Kelly echoed the statement. Yet in July, the school board announced further pay cuts, provoking demonstrations from tens of thousands of teachers. 25,000 people gathered on July 21, 1933, for a \\"Save Our Schools\\" protest. Banners read \\"Don't let the bankers cheat your children out of an education\\" and \\"Gratitude‚Äîmonths with no pay‚Äînow fired\\". Teachers marched on Grant Park and tore down a Century of Progress banner anticipating the coming World's Fair. Teachers and parents also sought legal injunctions against the Board of Education. The School Board nevertheless fired hundreds of teachers in September, leaving remaining teachers to teach more classes‚Äîof larger size. In October, the city received a $35 million federal loan, which it used to issue back pay. =Consolidation and charter= Chicago teachers had formed several different unions, some of which were still segregated by gender.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 23. The unrest in the early 1930s served to unite these groups, which previously had difficulty cooperating.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 28. Chicago teachers played an active role in the AFT and retained their status as Local 1. In 1937, Local 1 battled New York's Local 5 over whether the AFT would remain in the American Federation of Labor (AFL) or join the newer and more inclusive Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). (New York's Local 5 was at that time the Teachers' Union, which was soon expelled from the AFT after accusations of communism, and replaced by the more moderate United Federation of Teachers.) Soon after the convention (which decided to stay in the AFL), the Chicago Teachers Union was officially chartered by the AFT as an amalgamation of Chicago's multiple teacher unions in Chicago. At this point about 3,500 teachers were members of the new Local. By September, it was the largest teachers union in the U.S., with over 8500 members.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 44. The CTF, still under Haley's leadership, remained separate for some years, based on concerns that the CTU would disproportionately represent the interests of males and high school teachers.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 45.  Before collective bargaining: 1937‚Äì1967  When the CTU formed, teachers had become disillusioned about their status as a special class of workers. Some elementary school teachers were paid less than janitors, and more teachers came to agree that they experienced discrimination because they were female. (Meanwhile, male teachers felt shortchanged and emasculated.) Teachers also resented the constantly increasing bureaucratic control over their classrooms.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), pp. 18‚Äì21. = Goals = The CTU sought collective bargaining rights early on, but Superintendent William Johnson refused to grant them. The union also targeted evaluations (for teachers who wanted to become principals) that it said were administered in a corrupt fashion. By 1939, the CTU had more than doubled in size, to 8,500 members, and organized its members for actions such as mass letter-writing. In 1948, amid small-scale sickouts and walkouts, the CTU authorized a strike when teachers experienced still more 'payless paydays' due to city neglect. The strike was averted hours before it was scheduled to begin, when the school board approved a new budget and announced that the checks due to the teachers had been mailed with all possible haste. In addition to perennial requests for salary increases, the CTU began demanding more direct changes to Chicago's public schools. It asked the Chicago Police Department to station an officer in each of Chicago's 43 high schools; CPD refused. The CTU continued to pursue the school violence issue, insisting that teachers were being attacked by dangerous youths. During this period the union also sought shorter hours for students and teachers. It also called attention to a mounting teacher shortage, citing over a hundred classrooms without regular or substitute teachers. During this period, Fewkes and the CTU consistently opposed merit pay policies, proposals which would vary teachers salaries based on evaluations. = John Fewkes and anticommunism= The CTU's first president was John Fewkes. Fewkes had been the most prominent leader of \\"Voluntary Emergency Committee\\" (VEC), a male-dominated group that formed in 1933 and gained prominence by advocating and coordinating militant action. The VEC had been aggressive but not radical, and explicitly sought to exclude communists.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), pp. 38‚Äì39. The union, urged on by Fewkes, participated in the AFL's anti-communist purges, and in 1941 voted 5,258 to 892 to expel the New York City Teachers Union, the New York College Teachers Union and Philadelphia Teachers Union from the AFT. The three expelled Locals were large, representing about one quarter of the AFT's members, but the CTU was larger, and its votes were decisive in accomplishing the expulsion. Fewkes remained CTU President for most of this period. He left the CTU in 1943 to serve as AFT president. In 1944, he took a position with the federal War Production Board.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 82. By 1947, he had returned to the CTU for a second term as its president. In 1950, the CTU governing board approved a constitutional amendment to remove limitations on presidential terms; John Fewkes was thereby allowed to run again, and remained CTU president until 1966. =Demographics and civil rights= Most of Chicago's public school teachers were white single women. Public school teacher was also the most common occupation for black women in Chicago, who were treated by CPS as second-class job candidates: qualified black high school teachers worked in elementary schools or as substitutes; some could not get jobs at all.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), p. 15. \\"Black teachers also enjoyed fewer career prospects than did white teachers. With only two black high schools in the city, DuSable and Wendell Phillips, the vast majority of black teachers worked in elementary schools even if they were trained for better-paying high school work. Out of 321 black teachers who worked in the Chicago public school system in 1934, 285 of them taught in the elementary schools. With fewer opportunities for African American high school teachers, many qualified teachers from the South had to work as substitutes or take other jobs in Chicago until teaching positions opened up for them.\\" Teachers came from a shifting mix of white-collar and blue-collar families.Lyons, Teachers and Reform (2008), pp. 16. =Campaign for collective bargaining= The CTU intensified its campaign for collective bargaining rights in the 1960s, staging huge demonstrations at the Chicago Board of Education. Pressure increased after the New York recognized collective bargaining rights for the UFT in 1961, and the CTU threatened an illegal strike in 1963‚Äì1964 if the School Board would not grant it the same status. The city averted a strike by agreeing to negotiate, and, after long delays (including litigation from a rival union, the Chicago Education Association), the CTU became the official bargaining agent of Chicago teachers in April 1966.  Internal politics and organization  = Caucus of Rank and File Educators = In 2010, the Caucus of Rank and File Educators (CORE), led by President Karen Lewis gained control over the CTU by winning 60% of the vote in a run-off election. CORE ran an aggressive grassroots organizing campaign, and took a strong stance against school privatization. CORE accused the incumbent United Progressive Caucus (UPC) of capitulating to corporate interests, silencing dissent within the union, and collaborating with the city to prevent union outreach at schools. CORE quickly took action to distinguish itself from UPC, reaffirm its grassroots support, and launch a campaign to defend public education. The new leadership cut pay for union officers and used the savings to expand outreach. Former CTU member John A. Ostenburg criticized Lewis and CORE in 2011 for inexperience and political recklessness, arguing that they will not successfully be able to combat Mayor Rahm Emanuel's entrenched power. CORE represented a major bloc of dissent at the 2012 AFT convention, and held signs in protest of Race to the Top during a speech from Vice President Joe Biden. =2018 merger with Charter Union Local= In spring of 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union and Chicago Association of Charter Teachers and Staff Local 4343 voted to merge, with the charter educators forming a new division within the CTU. On December 4, 2018, CTU members at the Acero charter school network initiated the first strike at a unionized charter school in US history. The strike ended December 9, 2018, in a major victory with the strikers who won sanctuary school protections for their students, enforceable reductions in class size and parity with the existing pay scale at district-run schools. Collective bargaining and strikes = Strikes 1968‚Äì1987 = Chicago teachers went on strike multiple times in the 1970s and 1980s: * 1968: \\"Concerned FTBs\\" (long-term substitutes) and others engage in wildcat strikes against school segregation and racism‚Äîparticularly systemic unfairness in the certification, hiring, and promotion of black teachers. * 1969: Two-day strike results in salary increases, teacher aides, and class size maximum. * 1971: Four-day strike results in salary increases and full health benefits. * 1973: Two strikes, of 12 and 11 days, yield improved salary, benefits, preparation time, supplies, and class sizes. * 1979-1980: Multiple strikes over a payless payday during holiday break in 1979, results in salary increase and improved sick leave and maternity/paternity leave. * 1984: Four-day strike results in medical care increase and PAC checkoff. * 1985: Two-day strike for salary and sick leave. * 1987: Record-breaking 19-day strike under CTU President Jacqueline B. Vaughn wins raises and improvements to health care. =2012 strike= Striking members of the Chicago Teachers Union marching through the 290x290pxUnder the leadership of CORE, the CTU pushed hard in negotiations with the city. Early on, the CTU made the decision to decline an offer of pay increases combined with layoffs. When the city would not agree to the CTU's core demands, including an expansion of programs like art and music at the city's most underfunded high schools, CTU members voted overwhelmingly (90% of teachers and 98% of those who cast ballots) to authorize a strike. On September 10, 2012, the Chicago Teachers Union began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. This strike was the CTU's first since 1987, and the first strike ever for many of the teachers involved. Regulations required them to make contract negotiations an issue in the strike, and the teachers indeed sought better pay, better benefits, and protections for teachers who lose their jobs due to school closures. The striking teachers also wanted to call attention to a number of education issues, particularly what they defined as a broad attack on public schooling by corporate privatizers. In particular they demand a decrease in high-stakes testing for students, and an increase in music, art, and gym programs available at public schools. They also called for smaller class sizes and paid preparation time. On September 11, 2012, the Service Employees International Union Local 1 informed companies that some of their members might go on strike with the teachers. On September 14, 2012, the teachers reached a tentative agreement with the city, which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school, and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, however, and the strike continued, at which point Mayor Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, 2012, Mayor Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012. Students began their return to the schools on Wednesday, September 19, 2012. The CTU was still required to ratify the contract with the Union's 29,000 teachers. Following the end of the strike, leaders of the Union held town hall meetings in major U.S. cities to underscore the belief that community collaboration is key in creating beneficial changes in education, as opposed to top-down imposition by governors or mayors. The Union planned to hold town hall meetings in Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, St. Paul, and Tampa. =2015‚Äì2016 contract dispute= Following the expiration of the contract in June 2015, CPS teachers continued to work without a contract for a year while the union and district negotiated. In September 2016, union members voted overwhelmingly to strike if an agreement could not be reached, setting a deadline of October 11. Minutes before midnight on October 10, the district and union reached a tentative agreement, avoiding a strike. = 2019 strike = Chicago teachers marching during a demonstration on October 14, 2019.After the expiration of the CPS contract with CTU in June 2019, a contract dispute emerged. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders spoke at a rally hosted by CTU and SEIU Local 73 in preparation of the strike on September 24. On September 27, 2019, CTU members voted to authorize a potential strike starting on October 17 if a contract deal is not reached. The union's top priorities in contract negotiations are reducing classroom size and increasing the number of support staff (such as nurses and social workers). On October 16, 2019 CPS cancelled classes for October 17, 2019 in anticipation of the CTU strike. CTU delegates officially voted to go on strike hours afterwards. Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that CPS would not add any makeup days for any school days lost during the strike, stating that \\"There‚Äôs no plan to make up any days...We want to make sure we get a deal done.\\" At the time, Illinois state law required that all school districts in Illinois include at least 176 days in the school year. Lightfoot's decision broke this mandate, as the 2019‚Äì2020 school year was exactly 176 days long. Additionally, it was noted that teachers could lose pay if the strike days were not added back to the district calendar. On Thursday, October 17, 2019, teachers took to picket lines early in the morning, and the CTU stated that it planned to resume negotiations with the city at Malcolm X College. Later that afternoon, CPS announced that classes had been cancelled for the following day, as even though negotiations seemed to be progressing, there was no foreseeable agreement in the near feature. On Friday, October 18, 2019, teachers continued on the second day of the strike, meaning that students had attended school two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) out of the five days from October 14‚Äì18 (CPS students did not go to school on Monday due to the observance of Columbus Day). That weekend, CTU and CPS continued negotiating. While both sides noted progress over Saturday, Lightfoot noted that she would be \\"...very surprised if classes [would] open on Monday.\\" The following day, Sunday, October 20, 2019, CPS canceled school for Monday the 21st. Even though tentative agreements had been made on eight points, CPS canceled school for Monday as CTU had not voted to end the strike yet. On Monday, October 21, 2019, CTU members entered the third school day and second calendar week of the strike. Negotiations between CPS and CTU continued, and Lightfoot sent the union a letter asking them to end the strike while negotiations continued. CTU president Jesse Sharkey noted that \\"...the letter [from Lightfoot] I received today dashed my hope for a quick settlement.\\" That afternoon, Mayor Lightfoot canceled CPS classes for Tuesday, stating that \\"...CTU has not scheduled a House of Delegates vote, which would be necessary to end their strike...As a result, it will not be possible to hold classes tomorrow.\\" The next day, Tuesday, October 22, 2019, negotiations continued, and 2020 democratic presidential primary candidate Elizabeth Warren joined the striking teachers. Later, Mayor Lightfoot canceled CPS classes for Wednesday, October 23, stating once again that \\"...CTU has not scheduled a House of Delegates vote, which would be necessary to end their strike...As a result, it will not be possible to hold classes tomorrow.\\" It was noted that on Tuesday, negotiations appeared to be \\"at an impasse\\", and the majority of CTU's 40-person bargaining team was not expected to return to the negotiating table. CTU President Sharkey expressed that the proposed contract did \\"...not have adequate enforcement mechanisms on staffing.\\" After negotiations had ended Tuesday evening, several issues remained unresolved, such as class-size caps, the duration of the contract, salaries, and health benefits. At this point, teachers planned to keep the strike going until at least Thursday the 24th, or longer if necessary. On Wednesday, October 23, 2019, negotiations continued at Malcolm X College. Teachers only picketed in front of schools until 8:00 a.m. local time. Then, they proceeded to rally in the downtown Loop and converge in front of the city hall. Lightfoot presented her 2020 city budget plan Wednesday evening, at the end of the fifth school day of the strike. Emails and phone calls were disseminated to students and parents, informing them that classes were canceled for Thursday, October 24, as both the CTU and CPS still did not expect an agreement any time soon. The following day, on Thursday the 24th, teachers returned to the picket lines at 7:00 a.m., and the president of the Flight Attendant's Union, Sara Nelson, was expected to join the striking teachers to show support. CTU also scheduled civil disobedience training for its members at the CTU headquarters at 3:00 p.m., suggesting a prolonged strike. References =Bibliography= * Lyons, John F.

Owing to its specificity for guanine, RNase T1 is often used to digest denatured RNA prior to sequencing. Similar to other ribonucleases such as barnase and RNase A, ribonuclease T1 has been popular for folding studies. Structurally, ribonuclease T1 is a small Œ±+Œ≤ protein (104 amino acids) with a four-stranded, antiparallel beta sheet covering a long alpha helix (almost five turns). RNase T1 has two disulfide bonds, Cys2-Cys10 and Cys6-Cys103, of which the latter contributes more to its folding stability; complete reduction of both disulfides usually unfolds the protein, although its folding can be rescued with high salt concentrations. RNase T1 also has four prolines, two of which (Pro39 and Pro55) have cis isomers of their X-Pro peptide bonds.

Its CAS number is . Uses The main use of gadolinium oxysulfide is in ceramic scintillators. Scintillators are used in radiation detectors for medical diagnostics. The scintillator is the primary radiation sensor that emits light when struck by high energy photons. Gd2O2S based ceramics exhibit final densities of 99.7% to 99.99% of the theoretical density (7.32 g/cm3) and an average grain size ranging from 5 micrometers to 50 micrometers in dependence with the fabrication procedure.Rossner, W., M. Ostertag, and F. Jermann. \\"Properties and Applications of Gadolinium Oxysulfide Based Ceramic Scintillators.\\" Electrochemical Society Prceeedings, 98, 187-94. Two powder preparation routes have been successful for synthesizing Gd2O2S: Pr, Ce, F powder complexes for the ceramic scintillators. These preparations routes are called the halide flux method and the sulfite precipitation method. The scintillation properties of Gd2O2S: Pr, Ce, F complexes demonstrate that this scintillator is promising for imaging applications. There are two main disadvantages to this scintillator; one being the hexagonal crystal structure, which emits only optical translucency and low external light collection at the photodiode. The other disadvantage is the high X-ray damage to the sample.Greskovich, C. \\"CERAMIC SCINTILLATORS.\\" Annual Review of Materials Science, 1997, 27, 69-88. Terbium-activated gadolinium oxysulfide is frequently used as a scintillator for x-ray imaging. It emits wavelengths between 382-622 nm, though the primary emission peak is at 545 nm. It is also used as a green phosphor in projection CRTs, though its drawback is marked lowering of efficiency at higher temperatures. Variants include, for example, using praseodymium instead of terbium (CAS registry number , EINECS number 271-826-9), or using a mixture of dysprosium and terbium for doping (CAS number , EINECS number 271-824-8). Gadolinium oxysulfide is a promising luminescent host material, because of its high density (7.32 g/cm3) and high effective atomic number of Gd. These characteristics lead to a high interaction probability for X-ray radiation. Several synthesis routes have been developed for processing Gd2O2S phosphors, including: solid state reaction method, reduction method, combustion synthesis method, emulsion liquid membrane method, and gas sulfuration method. The solid state reaction method and reduction methods are most commonly used because of their high reliability, low cost, and high luminescent properties. (Gd0.99, Pr0.01)2O2S sub-microphosphors synthesized by homogeneous precipitation method are very promising for a new green emitting material to be applied to the high resolution digital X-ray imaging fieldLian, Jingbao. \\"Synthesis, Characterization and Photoluminescence Properties of (Gd0.99,Pr0.01)2O2S Sub- microphosphor by Homogeneous Precipitation Method.\\" Optical Materials, 2011-12, 33, 596-600. Gadolinium oxysulfide powder phosphors are intensively used for conversion of X-rays to visible light in medical X-ray imaging. Gd2O2S: Pr based solid state X-ray detectors have been successfully reintroduced to X-ray sampling in medical computed tomography (imaging by sections or sectioning, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave). Crystal Structure The crystal structure of gadolinium oxysulfide has Trigonal symmetry (space group number 164). Each gadolinium ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms and three sulfur atoms in a non-inversion symmetric arrangement. The Gd2O2S structure is a sulfur layer with double layers of gadolinium and oxygen in between.Rossner, W., M. Ostertag, and F. Jermann. \\"Properties and Applications of Gadolinium Oxysulfide Based Ceramic Scintillators.\\" Electrochemical Society Prceeedings, 98, 187-94. Toxicity An approved respirator should be worn if exposure to dust could occur when working with gadolinium oxysulfide. Inhalation may result in lung injuries. Exposure to gadolinium compounds may cause lung and/or liver damage. Gloves are highly recommended when skin contact is likely. Contact with the skin may cause rash, redness or dermatitis. Gadolinium oxysulfide should be stored away from mineral acids, strong oxidizers and flammable materials. When Gadolinium oxysulfide comes in contact with mineral acids, hydrogen sulfide can be produced.Gadolinium Oxysulfide; MSDS [online]; R.H.

Limestone and cement Weston is home to the largest Oamaru stone quarry in New Zealand, supplying New Zealand and exporting much overseas. The quarry lies a further mile inland from Weston, so its daily operation is not noticed by Weston residents. International cement manufacturer Holcim has gained consent to open a cement plant near Weston, involving further limestone quarrying. The application prompted the founding of the Waiareka Preservation Society, which opposes the planned plant. Society members are worried how potential extra traffic through the township would impact on roading infrastructure. However, Holcim has stated a preference for rail transport between the cement works and harbour and would seek to reopen the line to Weston.

In his Laghu vakya vritti Adi Shankara deals with the former vakya only. Vakya Vritti is a text of fifty-two Sanskrit slokas written by Adi Shankara and is in the form of a dialogue between an eager student and an enlightened teacher. There exists a very old commentary on this text but the name of its author is not known. Swami Chinmayananda's commentary on this exhaustive exposition of the Mahavakya Tat Tvam Asi was published in 1981. To explain each mantra as lucidly as a Guru (teacher) can is called Vritti. In Vakya Vritti a student approaches his Guru with a confession that the subject Mahavakya does not add up to any vivid understanding in his mind, and the teacher patiently elucidates what exactly the scripture means by the words employed in this significant sentence.  The Major Premises  The dialogue of the Vakya Vritti can be thought of as having the following major premises: 1) Tvam (You) refers to the spark of Divinity within each sentient being, which enlivens that being 2) Tat (That) refers to the immortal Brahman, the source of all life all around 3) Asi (are) refers to the Tvam-substance and the Tat-substance as being the same entity References External links Vakya Vritti Understanding That Thou Art Translated with a commentary by Hari Prasad Shastri Vedanta ","title":"Vakya Vritti"},{"id":"9759432","text":"William Larrabee may refer to: *William Larrabee (Iowa politician) (1832‚Äì1912), Governor of Iowa *William Larrabee (Indiana politician) (1870‚Äì1960), Congressman from Indiana *William C.

He played college football at Purdue University and professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1974 and for the San Diego Chargers from 1975 to 1976. He was selected to four Pro Bowls. He has three sons and a daughter. Early years Flanagan was born in 1944 in San Bernardino, California. His family moved to Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Flanagan played football under coach Earl Strohm at Altoona High School. When he was inducted into the Blair County Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, Flanagan noted that he had not been a star player in high school and was not a starter until his senior year. Purdue Flanagan played college football at Purdue University from 1962 to 1964. Flanagan grew from 190 pounds to 230 pounds between his freshman and sophomore year. During his sophomore and junior years, he played center on offense and linebacker on defense. As a senior, he was the starting center for the 1964 Purdue Boilermakers football team that featured Bob Griese at quarterback and compiled a 6‚Äì3 record and finished in third place in the Big Ten Conference. Flanagan was selected by the conference coaches for the United Press International as the second-team center on the 1964 All-Big Ten Conference football team. He also played in the Blue-Gray Game and the Senior Bowl after his senior year. Professional football Flanagan was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round, 64th overall pick, of the 1965 NFL Draft. His initial contract with the Lions was for a $2,000 bonus and $12,000 a year. While playing for the Lions, Flanagan supplemented his income in the off- season selling steel to the automobile companies, selling real estate, and working for a beer distributorship owned by former Detroit Tigers star Vic Wertz. Flanagan took over as the Lions' starting center as a rookie in 1965 and held the position for the next ten years. From 1965 to 1974, he started 139 games for the Lions, including a streak of 129 consecutive games. He was selected to play in the Pro Bowl four times, in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973. He was also selected by the UPI as a second-team All-NFL player in 1969 and by the Pro Football Writers as a second-team All-NFL player in 1970. Flanagan developed a rivalry with Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus. Flanagan recalled Butkus as his \\"greatest challenge.\\" He was quoted in 1973 calling Butkus \\"a wild man on defense . . . one of the most foul-mouthed guys in the league . . . he insults you, your mother, and the team.\\" Flanagan also claimed that Butkus \\"would spit down the back of his neck.\\" In May 1975, Flanagan signed with the San Diego Chargers. At the time, he said he was \\"happy to be back home in my native state,\\" but emphasized that he had been treated well by the Lions and was leaving under \\"happy circumstances.\\" He was the Chargers' starting center in the 1975 and 1976 seasons. In July 1977, Flanagan was traded by the Chargers to the Los Angeles Rams. However, he was released on waivers by the Rams in early September 1977 prior to the start of the regular season. Later years In 1984, Flanagan was hired as the offensive line coach for the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. In 1985, he was hired as the line coach for the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League. , he is an assistant coach with the Cedar Rapids Titans of the Indoor Football League.

Located within the city's ring of canals, it was originally built in Roman times and subsequently rebuilt several times over a number of centuries. It is close to the mediaeval Ticino gate and is one of the oldest churches in Milan. It is near the city park called Basilicas Park, which includes both the Basilica of San Lorenzo and the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, as well as the Roman Colonne di San Lorenzo.  History  = Origins = The basilica was built between the late fourth and early fifth centuries. The exact date is uncertain, as are the name of who commissioned it and the circumstances of its foundation. According to some scholars San Lorenzo was erected to coincide with the ‚ÄúBasilica Portiana‚Äù, which was built by the ‚ÄúAugustus of the West‚Äù (Valentinian I or Valentinian II) to please the Bishop of Milan Auxentius (355‚Äì372) of the Arian faith. If this is true, San Lorenzo would have preceded the foundation of the four Ambrosian basilicas. Supporting this proposition is the fact that the Basilica Portiana, cited in many sources that were quoting the struggle of Ambrose to remove it from the Arians, has never been identified with certainty by archaeologists. A second proposition gives the date of the foundation of the church to a later period, between 390 and 402, and attributes its commissioning to Theodosius I or Stilicho. Evidence for this proposition comes from archaeological investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004. Supporters of this view are divided as to the function of the building; for some it is an imperial basilica that would have confirmed the role of Milan as the imperial capital of the West, in rivalry with Rome and Constantinople; for others, it is a mausoleum for the Theodosian dynasty. What is certain is that at the time of its construction the basilica was the largest, centrally planned building in the West. The dedication of the temple to St. Laurence (San Lorenzo) the martyr has been certified only from 590, when Milan was already controlled by the Lombards. = The Medieval Period and the Renaissance = The church's exterior While Medieval Milan underwent a period of decline, San Lorenzo maintained a leading role in the city's liturgy: as the highest place in Milan it came to represent the Mount of Olives and on Palm Sunday the bishop blessed the palms and led the procession that from there to the now-demolished Basilica of Santa Tecla. The eleventh and twelfth centuries were marked by numerous disasters: fires, in particular, the terrible ‚Äúfire of the Stork‚Äù, that in 1071 devoured the basilica, devastating the internal decorations, and earthquakes, that undermined the stability of the complex, making new restorations necessary between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Towards the middle of the eleventh century, the open space behind the basilica, called Vetra, was used as the place of executions: this practice continued until 1840 and was reported, among others, by Alessandro Manzoni in the history of the infamous column. By 1167, with the construction of the medieval walls, the basilica was to be found within the city, at the new Porta Ticinese (Ticinese gate). = Recent and contemporary times = The basilica of San Lorenzo remained throughout the Middle Ages a symbol of the legacy of the Roman Empire in Milan. Subsequently, during the age of the Renaissance, especially after the 1154 destruction of the other Ancient Roman structures by Emperor Barbarossa, the temple was an example of the classical architectural canons admired by humanists, and studied by architects and artists such as Bramante, Leonardo, and Giuliano da Sangallo. Painted references to the church from that era can be identified. On 5 June 1573, the dome of the basilica suddenly collapsed, fortunately without causing casualties. Construction of a new dome in a more modern style began immediately and was completed in 1619. During the reconstruction, a miracle occurred, one predicted by Archbishop Carlo Borromeo: one year after his death in 1585, a sick woman was cured in front of the icon of the Madonna del Latte, displayed on the Piazza della Vetra. Following this event, donations increased enabling more rapid progress in the reconstruction. In 1626, the Madonna del Latte was transferred to the high altar where it remains to this day. In the 1830s the Austrian Government began a redevelopment of the Vetra: houses built leaning against the basilica and inhabited by tanners were demolished; the channel of the Vetra was covered over; and executions were abolished. After the bombings of 1944‚Äì1945 the houses that had been destroyed were not rebuilt enabling the park of the basilicas to be created, from which there is an excellent view of the complex. In 1934 in place of the demolished houses a sort of a courtyard was formed, with the creation of a public square opposite the basilica.  Art and architecture  Interior open central area The basilica, perhaps to avoid the unstable and marshy ground, was built on an artificial hill not far from the walls, along the Via Ticinensis, the main access route to the city, and not far from the Imperial Palace and the amphitheatre, from which were taken some of the materials used in constructing the temple itself. The complex was surrounded by various waterways, coming together to form the Vettabbia, the canal that takes away the waters of Milan, which still flow towards the agricultural areas to the south of the city. The building had a central plan approached by a four-sided portico and surrounded by two connected structures. Access to the portico was through a colonnade which in turn gave access to three portals leading to the main body of the building. This consisted of a square hall inscribed as a building with four apses, whose semicircular hollows overhung by semi-cupolas were articulated by four columns. Around this space ran the ambulatory surmounted by a space later used as a women's gallery. Towers rose at the four corners of the square building. The whole was topped by a dome of which we know little, this having been lost. The interior was lit by large windows, and probably decorated with marble in the lower parts and with mosaics in the vaults and arches. Of the two side buildings, the smaller was in the east, opposite the entrance: a chapel in the shape of a Greek cross, later on octagonal, dedicated to St Hippolytus. The larger building was to the south, having the function of the imperial mausoleum: tradition attributing its foundation to Galla Placidia, which is why the sacellum took on the name of the chapel of the Queen. Between 489 and 511 Bishop Lorenzo had a third structure built to the north, a chapel dedicated to St Sixtus, to be used for the burial of metropolitans. Perhaps in this period, when Roman imperial authority in Italy had diminished, the mausoleum to the south of the basilica was transformed into a chapel dedicated to St Genesius the martyr. By the sixth century, on the east wall, opposite the entrance, two portals were opened giving access to two local apses. Plan of the church In the tenth century, probably in the Ottonian era, reconstruction took place possibly involving the participation of a Byzantine workforce who had retained knowledge of the classical techniques of construction and decoration. Little is known regarding these restorations, but it is assumed that the cupola (dome) had been reconstructed using pipes made of terracotta, making it lighter than the previous one, perhaps already damaged to the extent of justifying a reconstruction. After the disasters of the eleventh century, the restorations of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries focused on providing stability to the whole complex, rebuilding the pillars that supported the cupola and carrying out other interventions on the load- bearing structures (columns, towers). In this period, a lantern was added above the dome, supported by flying buttresses leaning against the towers. In the fifteenth century, the Chapel of the Citizens was created from the hall of the apse in the southeast, which had already been refashioned in the eleventh century. After the collapse of 1573, a new cupola was commissioned from the architect, Martino Bassi. His collaboration with Rinaldi, Meda and Trezzi resulted in numerous changes and was only completed in 1619. Archbishop Borromeo had the chapel of St Genesius rededicated to St Aquilino, whose relics were placed in the chapel; to its sides were added two chapels, dedicated to St John the Baptist and the Holy Family. In 1623, at the wish of Archbishop Federico Borromeo there began the construction of the chapter house to the side of the courtyard, a project carried out by the architects Aurelio Trezzi and Francesco Maria Richino; construction was completed in 1626. In 1713 at the initiative of Francesco Croce, the Chapel of Redemption was inserted between those of St Aquilino and the Holy Family (now a sacristry). In 1894, the engineer and architect Cesare Nava built a vestibule in front of the church, consisting of three ionic arches in stone-like cement. In 1934 the houses that had sprung up in the courtyard were demolished, and in their place the following year was positioned a bronze statue of Constantine the Great, a copy of an original late antiquity preserved in Rome in San Giovanni in Laterano; the courtyard was opened to form a public square.  Pipe organ  On the face of the women's gallery to the right of the apse is to be found the pipe organ, built by the Milanese organ builder Pietro Bernasconi, re-using materials from the organ constructed in 1840 by Felice Bossi; he in turn had re-used parts from an earlier organ, restored in 1820 by Antonio Brunelli II and probably originally from the church of San Giovanni in Conca. The instrument, with a fully mechanical transmission, has its console situated at the centre of the organ case, comprising two manuals (keyboards) each of 61 notes (Great Organ, first manual; Second Organ, second manual), with a first extensive chromatic octave and a pedal board of 24 notes. The case, with its three arched fa√ßade, presents a display of 29 pipes of the Principal 8' arranged in three groups, one for each of the three arches, with the mitred mouths of the pipes aligned. Following on, the layout of the organ is arranged according to the position of the mechanisms that control the various stops in the columns of the stops either side of the console (at the left of the console the Second Organ; at the right the Great Organ and Pedal).

Notable is the octagonal Capella di Sant'Aquilino (chapel of St Aquilino), adjoining the main church to the south. The chapel, which may have originally been built as an imperial Roman mausoleum, features important 4th-century Paleochristian mosaics. Among the mosaics is included a formulaic depiction of Jesus, as \\"Christ the Lawgiver\\" (\\"Traditio Legis\\" - \\"handing over the law\\") or possibly \\"Christ the teacher.\\" Jesus is seated on a throne, flanked by a \\"school\\" of his Apostles, with a scroll box at his feet. The chapel was later dedicated to the martyr Saint Aquilino of Milan (or Saint Aquilinus of Cologne), with his remains being housed in the chapel. A 17th-century reliquary ark for the saint was crafted by Lombardian architect Carlo Garavaglia (flourished 1634-1635). The fresco The Rediscovery of the corpse of Saint Aquilinus of Cologne, by Carlo Urbino, decorates the wall behind the main altar in the Sant'Aquilino chapel.  Colonne di San Lorenzo  The square facing the basilica features the so- called \\"Colonne di San Lorenzo\\" (Columns of St. Lawrence), one of the few remains of the Roman \\"Mediolanum\\", dating from the 3rd century AD and probably belonging to the large baths built by the emperor Maximian. They were carried in the current place when the basilica construction was finished.  Chronology of the provosts (parish priests) The parish priest of San Lorenzo has long held the position of provost. The complete list of provosts is not known; the following names are derived from a list compiled from studies undertaken by the priest A. Baruffaldi, carved in marble and placed in the basilica itself.

University of Colorado Montler played college football at the University of Colorado where he was All-American in 1968. Buffalo Bills In 1973, his fifth year in the NFL, he became the starting center of the Bills, replacing Remi Prudhomme, splitting time with Bruce Jarvis, centering between Reggie McKenzie at left guard and Hall-of-Famer Joe DeLamielleure at right guard, for a fine 9-5 team, when O.J. Simpson became the first running back to rush for over 2,000 yards. In 1974, Montler won the job away from Jarvis, starting in all 14 games for another 9-5 season. The Bills lost ground in 1975 with a won-lost record of 8-6, despite having the best offense in the entire NFL with 420 points (30.0 points/game). For the second year in a row, Montler played all 14 games between McKenzie and DeLamielleure in the stout middle of the Bills offensive line. Although the same trio played together in all 14 games in 1976, the team sagged to 2-12, an offense worth 20th place in scoring and a defense 24th in points allowed.

This was enlarged since the Prodi Commission with the addition of training and multilingualism (The Directorate- General is still just Directorate-General for Education and Culture). However, when Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007, responsibility for multilingualism was handed over to the new Romanian commissioner, Leonard Orban. In its place the portfolio now also includes youth, sport and civil society. Figeƒæ describes his position is very orientated to \\"the citizens and their quality of life\\".J√°n Figeƒæ ec.europa.eu The Commission has become increasingly active in education. The ERASMUS programme, which was established in 1987, is a student exchange programme promoting mobility of students between European universities. The Bologna process aims to create a European Higher Education Area where academic qualifications can be recognised across Europe. The European Institute of Technology is a proposed research university. With the 2014 inauguration of the Juncker Commission, the portfolio was once again renamed ‚Äì multilingualism was removed in favor of citizenship: ‚ÄúEducation, Culture, Youth and Citizenship‚Äù. Citizenship in turn was soon replaced by sport. The title from 2014 to 2019 was thus European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport.

The play received its first production at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago in 2000. Boy Gets Girl uses the story of what happens when a blind date turns into a living nightmare to examine stalking, sexism and the nature of the idea of romantic pursuit. Theresa Bedell is a smart, successful woman in her 30s, who writes for an upscale literary New York magazine. She is utterly devoted to her work and struggles with relationships.

It is awkward, but not too awkward as Theresa accepts a second date. (They even find a couple things in common such as both being from the Midwest.) By the end of this date, she realizes that he is not right for her and politely excuses herself from the date. Tony continues to intrude further into Theresa‚Äôs life, with unexpected visits to Theresa‚Äôs office and unsettling phone messages at her home. Theresa starts to worry as she realizes that Tony knows where she lives. At her co-worker's urging, she calls the police, but when Officer Beck investigates, Theresa realizes there is not much that the police can do. Beck suggests moving out of her apartment and changing her name. Despite all her efforts to avoid him by hiding in her work and opening up to her colleagues, she eventually realizes that he has and will always have control over her life. She eventually loses everything, including her identity, humanity, and will, as she changes her name and moves out of New York City to Denver, a shadow of the woman she once was.

Yellowstone laid down on 16 October 1944 at Tacoma, Washington by the Seattle Division of the Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc.; launched on 12 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. F. A. Zeusler, the wife of Capt. F. A. Zeusler, USCG, the District Coast Guard Officer of the 13th Naval District; and commissioned on 16 January 1946, Captain J. A. Ferrall, Jr., in command. Service history After shakedown training out of San Diego and repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to correct minor deficiencies which appeared during her initial cruise, Yellowstone operated in the Seattle, Washington area into March 1946. She departed Seattle on the last day of the month, transited the Panama Canal on 11 April, and arrived at Newport, Rhode Island on the 20th to take up her duties tending destroyers of the Atlantic Fleet. Yellowstone performed faithful service to the Fleet for the next 28 years, providing repair, supply, and auxiliary services (i.e., power and fresh water) not only to destroyers (the purpose for which she was designed) but also to aircraft carriers and submarines. In time, this valuable adjunct to the fleet earned a reputation for reliability and dependability that caused some to nickname her \\"Old Faithful,\\" after the famous geyser in Yellowstone National Park. The destroyer tender also earned the coveted battle efficiency \\"E\\" award 10 times. Yellowstone was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea 11 times between 1947 and 1968. Her ports of operation ranged from Izmir, Turkey to Naples, Italy; from Venice to Taranto; from Souda Bay on the Island of Crete to Gibraltar; and included cities in Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. In between her deployments with the 6th Fleet, the destroyer tender operated out of Boston, Newport, Norfolk, Bermuda, Mayport, Florida. Her tasks were performed mostly unheralded and far from the public eye but were necessary to maintain the ships of the Fleet in operational trim. In October 1969 she performed a noteworthy repair job when she replaced 1,162 tubes in the number one propulsion boiler of as that ship was preparing to deploy to the Mediterranean. Working against the destroyer's deadline, Yellowstones skilled artisans accomplished the task in only 12 days and thus allowed her to get underway on time. Soon thereafter, Yellowstone deployed to the Mediterranean for the 12th and last time. She arrived at Naples on 9 December 1969 and, before long, found herself with another difficult, major repair task ahead of her. She replaced the starboard propeller of the , a job that normally required a dry-docking. Repair, supply, and deck divisions of both ships participated in the evolution that earned Yellowstone a commendation. A little more than a month later, the tender's talent was once again subjected to a rigorous test. On 10 February 1970 at Naples, the Greek registry freighter Mautric collided with Yellowstone and the tender's nest of destroyers. The , the , and the all suffered extensive hull and structural damage, but Yellowstone worked nearly 24-hour shifts from 13 to 22 February and effected the necessary repairs. Capt. R. D. Wood, commanding Yellowstone, and Senior Chief Ship Fitter William S. Burman received Navy commendation medals for heading the exemplary repair work that soon had all ships back in operational condition. Yellowstone at Augusta Bay, Sicily, Italy with , , , , , , and . In the background is . After a brief in-port period at Piraeus, Greece from 18 March to 5 April, Yellowstone returned to Naples, where she subsequently performed her second underwater propeller replacement of the deployment on the . The repair ship sailed for home in mid-May and arrived at Mayport, Florida on 1 June. One month later, on 1 July, the ship's home port was changed from Mayport to Charleston, South Carolina. The destroyer tender provided services to ships of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla (CruDesFlot) 6 into January 1971. At the end of that month, she sailed for Puerto Rico and took part in \\"Springboard\\" exercises before returning to Charleston on 16 February. That spring, when the Commander, CruDesFlot 6, embarked with the to deploy to the 6th Fleet, Yellowstones commanding officer became the administrative deputy to the Charleston representative of Commander, CruDesFlot 6. In that role, he coordinated local pier assignments; arranged for tug and tow services; made military guard ship and pier sentry assignments; scheduled ship tours; provided information and assistance to dependents; and represented the destroyer force at meetings of numerous naval station, base, and district advisory boards and committees. Yellowstone remained in port at Charleston into 1973. Among the noteworthy events that occurred that year was the ship's nomination to receive the Ney Award, recognizing the ship's outstanding food service mess, as the nominee of the Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. In 1974 the ship's biolers were converted to use Navy distillate fuel. After 28 years of continuous service to the Fleet (the last few years of which were spent along the eastern seaboard of the United States) Yellowstone was decommissioned on 11 September 1974. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register the next day and subsequently transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal, the veteran auxiliary was sold for scrapping in September 1975.

El Pacificador (The Peace Maker) (5 May 1775 in Fuentesecas, Zamora, Spain - 27 July 1837 in Bar√®ges, France) was a Spanish general.  Biography  In 1791 Morillo enlisted in the Real Cuerpo de Marina (Spanish Royal Marine Corps) and participated in the Battle of Trafalgar in which he was wounded and made prisoner by the English in 1805. He also fought against Napoleon Bonaparte in 1808 during the Peninsular War (part of Napoleonic Wars) to defend his mother country Spain against the French invasion. Once the war ended and the Spanish monarchy was restored, King Ferdinand VII of Spain appointed him Expedition Commander and General Captain of the Provinces of Venezuela on 14 August 1814. He set sail with a fleet of 18 warships and 42 cargo ships and disembarked in Carupano and Isla Margarita with the mission to pacify the revolts against the Spanish monarchy in the American colonies. He travelled to La Guaira, Caracas, Puerto Cabello, Santa Marta and Cartagena de Indias (United Provinces of New Granada) in a military campaign to fight Simon Bol√≠var's revolutionary armies. Pablo Morillo On 22 August 1815 Morillo surrounded the walled city of Cartagena and put it under siege, preventing any supplies from going in until 6 December that year, when the Spanish Royal Army entered the city. With control over Cartagena, Morillo returned to Venezuela to continue the fight against revolutionaries. In June 1820 Morillo, under Royal mandate, ordered that everyone in the colonies obey the Cadiz Constitution and sent delegates to negotiate with Bolivar and his followers. Bolivar and Morillo later met in the Venezuelan town of Santa Ana and signed a six-months' armistice followed by a second one named \\"War Regularization\\". Morillo returned to Spain, was named General Captain of New Castile, and supported the Liberal Constitution during the Liberal Triennium. He prevented a coup against the Constitution in 1822, and fought in 1823 the French invasion under Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me in the north of Spain, where he was defeated. When King Ferdinand VII restored the absolute regime in 1823 he went to France. A few years later, he returned to Spain and participated in some military operations during the Carlist Wars. He felt ill and went back to France where he died on 27 July 1837. Quotes When Morillo ordered the execution of the scientist Francisco Jos√© de Caldas (known as El Sabio Caldas, \\"Wise Caldas\\") and the people present at San Francisco Square of Santa Fe appealed for the life of the scientist, Morillo responded: \\"Spain does not need wise people.\\" (Spanish:\\"Espa√±a no necesita sabios\\").Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas, Francisco Jos√© de Caldas (1771 - 1816) , retrieved on May 1, 2007 This sentence became the slogan of Spain's wars for the re- conquest of the rebel colonies.

Born in Lorrha, County Tipperary, Hogan first played competitive hurling whilst at school at the Presentation College, Birr. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor team, before later joining the under-21 team. He joined the senior team during the 1986 championship. Hogan went on to win two All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions throughout his career, however, Hogan never won a Railway Cup medal. At club level he played with Lorrha-Dorrha. Throughout his career Hayes made 20 championship appearances for Tipperary. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1993 championship. In retirement from playing, Hogan became involved in team management and coaching. He has served as manager of the Tipperary senior and under-21 teams, as well as a number of club teams. Early life From a young age Ken Hogan showed great skill at the game of hurling. He was educated at the local national school and later studied at the Presentation College in Birr, County Offaly. Here Hogan won a Leinster colleges' titles. Playing career =Club= Hogan began playing hurling with his local club, Lorrha-Dorrha, at a young age. He won two under-14 'B' championship medals in 1976 and 1977 with his club. Hogan subsequently won a North Tipperary under-21 'B' medal in 1983. He also won two North Tipperary senior hurling championship medals, captaining his side to the title in 1989. =Minor and under-21= Hogan joined the Tipperary inter-county minor panel in 1980. That year he had his first major success when he captured a Munster Minor Hurling Championship title. He later lined out in the minor championship decider with Wexford providing the opposition. Tipp had a 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì10 win, giving Hogan an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Hogan later joined the Tipperary under-21 panel, winning a Munster title at this level in 1983. He later lined out in the All-Ireland final against Galway. A final score of 0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì9 in Galway's favour meant that Hogan ended up on the losing side.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 In 1984 he added a second consecutive Munster under-21 title to his collection before later lining out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Kilkenny were the opponents on that occasion, but Tipp were defeated again by 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 42 It was Hogan's last year with the county under-21 team. =Senior= Hogan subsequently joined the Tipperary senior panel and made his debut in 1987. Tipperary won its first Munster title in 16 years following a draw and a replay with Cork in FitzGerald Stadium, Killarney . In the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final Galway defeated Tipperary 3‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì17. In 1988 Hogan added a National Hurling League medal to his collection. He later captured his second Munster medal following another victory over Cork. A subsequent defeat of Antrim allowed Tipp to advance to the All-Ireland final against Galway. Noel Lane scored a goal for Galway while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway. In 1989, Hogan won his third provincial title in-a-row after a 0‚Äì26 to 2‚Äì8 win over Waterford. For the third time in as many years Tipp faced Galway in the All-Ireland series, but on this occasion the men from the West were without Tony Keady. In the game Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. Antrim, the surprise winners of the other semi-final, provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. It was only the second appearance of an Ulster team in the championship decider. Tipperary however won convincingly with a 4‚Äì24 to 3‚Äì9 win.The GAA Book of Lists p. 363 Tipp thus preserved their record of being the only team to win an All-Ireland title in every decade in GAA history. It was Hogan's first senior All-Ireland medal. In 1990 Tipperary surrendered their Munster crown to Cork for the first time in four years. This defeat followed Babs Keating's infamous remark about Cork that \\"donkeys don't win derbies\\".Munster Hurling Legends p. 130 Tipp returned in 1991 and defeated Cork in a Munster final replay giving Hogan his fourth provincial medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Tipp take on Kilkenny for the first time in twenty years. A goal by Michael Cleary in the first-half gave Tipp a lead which they never surrendered. A 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì15 victory allowed Hogan to capture his second All-Ireland medal in three years.The GAA Book of Lists p. 363 1992 saw Tipp exit the championship at an early stage, however, the team bounced back for one last hurrah in 1993. That year Hogan added a fifth Munster medal to his collection as Tipp beat Clare by 3‚Äì27 to 2‚Äì12. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Tipp renew their rivalry with Galway; however, on this occasion Galway won. This defeat brought the curtain down on Tipp's great revival while also being an end to Hogan's inter-county career. Managerial career =Tipperary Senior= Hogan maintained an interest in hurling following his retirement as a player. He served as a selector under Fr Tom Fogarty in the mid-1990s when Fogarty was Tipperary manager. He later held the same position under Nicky English in the early 2000s. Hogan succeeded Michael Doyle as manager of the Tipperary senior hurling team in 2003. He served as manager for two seasons but, apart from a Munster final appearance in 2005, had little success and left in 2005. =Tipperary Under-21= On 11 September 2010, Tipperary Under-21 hurlers, managed by Hogan, won the All Ireland Under-21 title by defeating Galway by 5‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì12 at Semple Stadium. Hogan managed the Under-21 team from 2009 until stepping down in 2013.

The Executive Residence, known better as the Governor's Mansion, is located at 99 Cambridge Road in the Village of Maple Bluff, Wisconsin, on the eastern shore of Lake Mendota. It is currently the official residence of Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers. The Wisconsin Governor's Mansion is only one of four official State governor's residences in the country that is not located within its State's capital (the others being Drumthwacket, located in Princeton, New Jersey, instead of Trenton; the Ohio Governor's Mansion, located in the suburb of Bexley instead of Columbus; and the Tennessee Governor's Mansion, located in Oak Hill instead of Nashville, Tennessee). History Construction began in 1920 for Madison industrialist Carl A. Johnson as a home. Twelve years later, it was purchased by Thomas R. Hefty, a Madison banker, who sold it to the State during 1949 for $47,500. Governors of Wisconsin, and their families, have resided in the residence ever since. Up to this time, they had resided in the Old Executive Mansion. Architect Frank Riley of Madison, Wisconsin, designed the mansion in the southern Classical Revival style. The Residence sits on along Lake Mendota. Although it was renovated extensively during the 1960s, the Residence now is much as Johnson planned originally. The more than of living space include 34 rooms, 13 bathrooms and 7 bedrooms and fireplaces. Several items of Wisconsin historical interest may be found throughout the Executive Residence. The wrought-iron fence on the street side of the property originally surrounded the old State Capitol Building. The mansion is wood framed structure with painted stucco over sandstone and hollow clay tile face. It is three stories high and has a basement level for a total of 20,777 gross square feet. There are 7 major garden areas, including a screened-in gazebo and winding walkways that lead to the lake shore. Public access An estimated 20,000 visitors a year pass through the doors for receptions, dinners, meetings, and public tours. Governor Tony Evers is the 15th governor to live in the Executive Residence. Public tours are offered every Thursday during the months of April through August from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Holiday tours are also offered during December. There is no charge for admission. Groups of 20 or more are required to make a reservation. Solar power Solar panels at the executive residence. In 2009, then Governor Jim Doyle requested the installation of solar panels on the side roof of the governor's mansion. The plan was approved by a board that handles building projects. The panels power the water heater for the residence. Administration The building is administered by the State Capitol & Executive Residence Board (SCERB), which must approve the annual maintenance budget and major capital improvements. The 16-member State Capitol Executive Residence Board includes 7 citizen members with specified expertise appointed by the governor to serve staggered 6-year terms. The purpose of the State Capitol and Executive Residence Board is to: \\"direct the continuing and consistent maintenance of the property, decorative furniture and furnishings of the Capitol and Executive Residence\\". The staff of the Residence are part of the Wisconsin Department of Administration's Capitol Bureau Building Management team. An on-site Capitol Police detail guards the building year-round. The Wisconsin Executive Residence Foundation, a non-profit, raises money to pay for maintenance that SCERB is unable or unwilling to spend state tax dollars on. The Wisconsin Executive Residence Foundation was established during 1964 by act of the Wisconsin Legislature at the request of Dorothy Knowles, the wife of Governor Warren Knowles. She said at the time \\" the place was a firetrap, we were afraid to move in.\\" After the establishment of the foundation, the Residence received its first major renovation since its purchase during 1949. The Governor's spouse acts as ex- officio chair of the foundation's board.

The US edition was published by Doubleday. Like many of du Maurier's novels, The House on the Strand has a supernatural element, exploring the ability to mentally travel back in time and experience historical events at first hand - but not to influence them. It has been called a Gothic tale, \\"influenced by writers as diverse as Robert Louis Stevenson, Dante, and the psychologist Carl Jung, in which a sinister potion enables the central character to escape the constraints of his dreary married life by travelling back through time\\". The narrator agrees to test a drug that transports him back to 14th century Cornwall and becomes absorbed in the lives of people he meets there, to the extent that the two worlds he is living in start to merge. It is set in and around Kilmarth, where Daphne du Maurier lived from 1967, near the village of Tywardreath, which in Cornish means \\"House on the Strand\\". Plot The setting for the story is an ancient Cornish house called Kilmarth, which is based on the house the author had recently bought, following the death of her husband. The narrator, Dick Young, has given up his job and been offered the use of Kilmarth by an old university friend, Magnus Lane, a leading biophysicist in London. He reluctantly agrees to act as a test subject for a drug that Magnus has secretly developed. On taking it for the first time, Dick finds that it enables him to enter into the landscape around him as it existed during the early 14th century. He becomes drawn into the lives of the people he sees there and is soon addicted to the experience. Dick finds himself following Roger, who lives at Kilmarth, acts as steward to Sir Henry Champernoune, and is a secret admirer of the beautiful Isolda, wife of Sir Oliver Carminowe. She has been conducting a secret affair with the brother of Sir Henry's wife, Sir Otto Bodrugan, who is waylaid and killed by Oliver's men. Each visit corresponds to a key moment in the story of Isolda and Roger. Each time Dick returns to real time he is more confused; throughout the experience he is unable to interact with the couple. Any attempt to do so brings Dick crashing back to the present in a state of nauseated exhaustion. The drug has other dangers in that following Roger means that Dick walks unaware through the modern landscape with all the danger that entails. Dick's wife, an American widow called Vita, and her young sons join him in Cornwall and are worried by his bizarre behaviour. It is made clear that Dick has no passionate feelings for his new wife, does not want the new job in the USA she has found for him and has no fatherly affection for her two boys‚Äîwhich makes plausible his increasing desire to escape into the past. Magnus intends to join Dick, but is killed in what seems like a bizarre accident or suicide‚Äîstruck by a train whilst straying onto the local railway track. Dick knows the truth, that Magnus was under the influence of the drug; this makes the inquest difficult. Dick's penultimate trip ends with him attempting to defend Isolda from Sir Henry's vindictive widow Joanna in the 14th century, but in reality attacking Vita. She and her children hide from him and he contacts a doctor who helps to wean him from his addiction to the drug. Dick explains the power of the drug, and is informed by the doctor that analysis has revealed its extremely dangerous nature. However, Dick's addiction is such that he takes the last remaining dose soon after. Dick's last visit occurs during the Black Death in 1349. A dying Roger confesses his love for Isolda and the fact that she died peacefully from a drug he administered rather than from the plague. After the death of his doppelg√§nger Roger and the Isolda they both loved, Dick has little incentive to return to the other world, but in any case there is no drug left to allow his passage there. As the book closes, Dick attempts to pick up the phone but suddenly finds he is unable to grip it. Speaking of the novel's unresolved ending, Daphne du Maurier said in an interview: \\"What about the hero of The House on the Strand? What did it mean when he dropped the telephone at the end of the book? I don‚Äôt really know, but I rather think he was going to be paralysed for life. Don‚Äôt you?\\" Radio versions * 1973 BBC Radio Saturday Night Theatre - Adapted by Philip Leaver and Kay Patrick, starring Ian Richardson.

The evening consisted of a series of show business-themed comedy sketches and song-and-dance routines tailored for the talents of its centerpiece, Bette Davis, who accepted the challenge of an eight-shows-a-week schedule when good film roles failed to follow her triumph in All About Eve. The out-of-town tryout opened at the Shubert Theatre in Detroit on October 19, 1952. In the middle of the third chorus of her first song, an overworked Davis collapsed. Revived by her then-husband Gary Merrill, she walked to the apron of the stage and with a smile commented to the audience, \\"Well, you can't say I didn't fall for you!,\\" winning over both them and the critics, whose reviews were kind. From there the show moved to Pittsburgh, where it was met with less enthusiasm, and the creative team began reshaping it on a nightly basis. By the time it reached Boston it was in serious trouble, and noted play doctor and Davis pal John Murray Anderson was called in for consultation. Roles were recast, sketches were eliminated and new ones added, and musical sequences were rearranged. Several songs were contributed by others, including Sheldon Harnick, and Horton Foote was among those who wrote additional sketch material. Among the leading lady's characterizations were Tallulah Bankhead, Jeanne Eagels, an actress involved with an Italian director, a hillbilly singer on a television variety show, and a performer in parodies of plays by No√´l Coward and Arthur Miller. With Davis bedridden due to exhaustion, the Broadway opening, scheduled for December 4, was postponed. The revue, directed by Jules Dassin and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, finally opened on December 15, 1952 at the Alvin Theatre, where it ran for 90 performances. In addition to Davis, the cast included David Burns, Nora Kaye, George S. Irving, Maria Karnilova, Tina Louise, Ellen Hanley, Stanley Prager, and Hiram Sherman, who won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Despite mostly unfavorable notices, the show played to sold-out houses. Davis continued to suffer from fatigue, but doctors could find no physical cause. When a wisdom tooth became inflamed, it was discovered she was suffering from osteomyelitis of the jaw, which required immediate surgery. With no hope of Davis returning in the near future, the producers opted to close the show, but not before Bette Davis's understudy Lenore Korman took over the role. But the production ended up losing $320,000 of the investment. There is an undocumented rumor that Bette Davis wanted no part of this musical and she had from the very beginning found a woman in the singing ensemble who had a most fabulous voice, to eventually take over the role after Davis feigned all her illness. The star's rehabilitation ultimately kept her unemployed for the next three years. That also was an unverified ruse and Davis simply took a break. The original cast recording is available on compact disc on the Sepia label. The compact disc release includes six bonus tracks not on the original cast LP record.

Erdmann was born in Wenden (Cƒìsis) in the Governorate of Livonia. He was the great-nephew of the philosopher Johann Eduard Erdmann. His first musical studies were in Riga, where his teachers were Bror M√∂llersten and Jean du Chastain (piano) and Harald Creutzburg (harmony and counterpoint). From 1914 he studied piano in Berlin with Conrad Ansorge and composition with Heinz Tiessen. In the 1920s and early 1930s his name was frequently cited among Germany's leading composers. Moreover, Erdmann had an international reputation as an outstanding concert pianist whose repertoire encompassed Beethoven and the advocacy of contemporary music. In 1925, he gave the premiere of Artur Schnabel's Piano Sonata, at the Venice ISCM Festival.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom. ed. From 1925 he was professor of piano at the Cologne Academy of Music but was forced to resign from his post by the Nazis in 1935 and became an 'inner exile', composing almost nothing until after the end of World War II. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937; while not in sympathy with National Socialism, his decision was to avoid government harassment so that he could continue to work, like several other German musicians at the time. This action ruined his post-war reputation, and it did not recover in his lifetime.http://www.classicalarchives.com/composer/37150.html#tvf=tracks&tv;=about He resumed teaching as Professor of Piano at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Hamburg in 1950, but died of a heart-attack in 1958. His students at Hamburg included Aloys and Alfons Kontarsky. There has been little revival of interest in his own music and all his post-World War II works remain in manuscript; considering his inter-war eminence, he has received remarkably little attention up to the present day, but in 2006 the cpo label began issuing a series of CDs of his orchestral works. Erdmann came to critical notice as a composer with the sensational success of his First Symphony (dedicated to Alban Berg) in 1919. He was also close friends with Ferruccio Busoni's pupil Philipp Jarnach, as well as Ernst Krenek, Artur Schnabel and Emil Nolde. Like Tiessen and Schnabel, he was deeply impressed by Schoenbergian and Bergian Expressionism but did not adopt the twelve-note method, preferring a freely and often totally chromatic vocabulary with little or no sense of key. His total output is quite small, and surprisingly contains very little piano music: but it came to include four symphonies, Nos. 3 and 4 dating from after World War II and thus still unpublished (although the Third Symphony was recorded and released on the CPO label with the Capricci opus 21).See CPO number 777 068-2 recorded January 2‚Äì10, 2004 As early as 1920 Erdmann issued a credo in which he declared himself opposed to the extreme individualism in music from Ludwig van Beethoven to Arnold Schoenberg, and dedicated instead to the creation of a more objective music characterized by what he called the 'third-person forms' created by composers from Heinrich Sch√ºtz to Anton Bruckner. Between 1921 and 1943, Erdmann often appeared with the Australian violinist Alma Moodie, who lived in Germany.Peter Laki, Bartok and His World Erdmann dedicated his Sonata for Solo Violin, Op. 12 (1921) to her, and she premiered it in Berlin in October 1921.Eduard Erdmann The Australian-English critic Walter J.

It was designed and built by Sonoma County luthier Doug Irwin. The instrument was commissioned by Garcia in 1973 following delivery of Wolf, his first major Irwin-built guitar. Upon commissioning the instrument, Garcia enjoined Irwin to \\"make it the way he thought was best, and don't hold back.\\"http://jerrygarcia.com/guitars/ Throughout the design and construction process, it was provisionally designated \\"the Garcia\\". The final name came from the tiger inlaid on the preamp cover located on the guitar's top, just behind the tailpiece. The body features several layers of wood laminated together face-to-face in a configuration referred to as a \\"hippie sandwich\\" by employees of Alembic Inc., where Irwin worked for a brief period in the early 1970s. The combination of several heavy varieties of wood, plus solid brass binding and hardware resulted in an unusually heavy instrument, weighing . After Garcia began using a new Irwin guitar (known as Rosebud) in December 1989, Tiger became his backup guitar. On the 9th of July 1995 during a Grateful Dead concert, a problem arose with Rosebud. Tiger was brought out and thus became the last guitar Garcia played in public. Rosebud, a guitar similar to Tiger Electronics The electronics of Garcia's Irwin guitars are unique, and feature an onboard preamp and effects loop. Much like a Stratocaster, the three pickups are selected with a five-way switch. Signal from the pickups passes through the tone controls, followed by an op-amp based buffer preamp, or unity gain buffer, which is designed to prevent signal loss due to capacitance when long cables are used. From the preamp, the signal could be routed via a mini-toggle on the guitar's face to pass through a Y-cable to Garcia's effects rack, and then back into the guitar. This onboard effects loop serves to send the full output of Tiger's pickups to the effects while allowing the guitar's volume control to vary the final output. The effects loop could be bypassed by the aforementioned switch, sending the guitar's signal from the preamp to the volume control, and then out to Garcia's preamped (and heavily modified) Fender Twin Reverb into a McIntosh MC2300 solid state power amplifier. Tiger started with DiMarzio Dual Sound humbuckers in the middle and bridge positions with a DiMarzio SDS-1 single coil at the neck. The humbuckers were switched to Dimarzio Super II's in 1982. Each of the humbuckers is equipped with a coil cut switch. In summation, there is one 5 way pickup selector, one master volume control, one tone control which affects the neck and bridge pickups, and one which affects the middle pickup as well as three mini toggles, two for the coil-cut of the bridge and middle pickups respectively and one for the on-board effects loop on/off. Disposition After Garcia's death, a dispute arose between Irwin and the Grateful Dead regarding ownership of Garcia's Irwin guitars. In his will, Garcia gave possession of these instruments to Irwin; the Grateful Dead challenged whether Garcia had the right to convey title and insisted that the band owned the instruments. The parties reached a settlement where Irwin was awarded Garcia's more famous instruments, and the Grateful Dead took possession of the majority of the guitars. Irwin sold his most enduring guitars, Tiger and Wolf, at auction on May 8, 2002. Tiger was purchased by Jim Irsay for $957,500, including commission. The price for Wolf was $789,500. In 2017, Wolf was sold for $1.9 million, at an auction to benefit the Southern Poverty Law Center. The buyer was business executive and Deadhead Brian Halligan.

Astronaut Dr. Frank Poole is seen playing a recreational game of chess with the HAL 9000 supercomputer. Poole views the board on a computer screen and dictates his moves orally to HAL using descriptive notation. Poole, playing white, is not surprised when the presumed infallible supercomputer soundly defeats him. In the 1968 novel, no particular chess game is depicted, although it is mentioned that the astronauts can play chess and other games with HAL, and that, for the purpose of morale, the computer is programmed to temper its superiority by winning only 50% of games. The film's director Stanley Kubrick was a passionate chess player, so unlike many chess scenes shown in other films, the position and analysis make sense. The actual game seems to come from a tournament game between A. Roesch and W. Schlage, Hamburg 1910. The game The game depicted in the film seems to be based on the moves of the following tournament game played in Hamburg, 1910: White: A. Roesch Black: W.

After Poole's \\"rook to king one\\", HAL says: \\"I'm sorry Frank, I think you missed it: queen to bishop three, bishop takes queen, knight takes bishop, mate.\\" HAL gave Black's queen move from White's perspective, although in descriptive notation it should be given from Black's perspective as \\"queen to bishop six\\". While HAL describes a checkmate in two moves, Poole could forestall mate two extra moves; for example: 16.Qc8 Rxc8 17.h3 Nxh3+ 18.Kh2 Ng4#. '''''' :Poole resigns without questioning HAL's analysis: \\"Yeah, looks like you're right. I resign.\\" Pentomino scene According to some records and a still photograph taken from a scrapped film reel, a deleted scene depicted the astronauts challenging HAL in a game called Pentomino similarly to how Poole challenged HAL in chess. The game was meant to be mass-produced by Parker Brothers as a tie-in to the film, but the scene eventually never saw release.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxDA_PL-XzA The game was released as Universe in 1967, with pictures from the film on the box, including the aforementioned still photograph.

He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1969 to 1972 and was selected as a consensus first-team offensive tackle on the 1972 College Football All-America Team. He later played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a tight end for the Buffalo Bills from 1973 to 1978, catching 62 passes for 818 yards. Early years Seymour was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1950. He grew up in Berkley, Michigan, and attended Shrine Catholic High School in Royal Oak, Michigan. His older brother, Jim Seymour, also attended Shrine High School and went on to become a standout wide receiver at the University of Notre Dame. Both Seymour brothers were inducted into the Shrine High School Hall of Fame in 2009, along with their brother, John, who played running back at West Point. University of Michigan Seymour enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1968 and played for coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1969 to 1972. He played as a split end in 1969 and a tight end from 1970 to 1971. In his two seasons as a tight end, Seymour caught 19 passes for 257 yards and one touchdown. At 6'5\\", 250 lbs., he was converted to an offensive tackle in 1972. At the end of the 1972 season, Seymour was selected as a consensus first-team offensive tackle on the 1972 College Football All-America Team. He received first-team honors from the Newspaper Enterprise Association, the Football Writers Association of America, the American Football Coaches Association, the Sporting News and Time magazine. Professional football Seymour was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the first round (seventh overall pick) of the 1973 NFL Draft. He was drafted primarily as an offensive lineman to block for O. J. Simpson, but he was converted back to the tight end position. As a rookie, he started all 14 games as a tight end for the Bills and caught 10 passes for 114 yards. Seymour ultimately played five seasons for the Bills from 1973 to 1977, appearing in 69 games, 68 of them as the team's starting tight end. His best game as an NFL player came against the undefeated New England Patriots on October 20, 1974. In that game, Seymour caught three passes for 64 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Bills to an upset victory over the Patriots. In five seasons with the Bills, Seymour caught 62 passes for 818 yards. In August 1978, the Bills traded Seymour to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for wide receiver Frank Lewis. However, Seymour failed to pass the Steelers' physical when they discovered that he had undergone surgery on his arches. Seymour was returned to the Bills, but he never played another NFL game. Later years Seymour currently resides in Okemos, Michigan.

It is the only member of its genus. Humblot's flycatcher is endemic to the island of Grand Comoro in the Comoros where it inhabits forest on the slopes of Mount Karthala. The scientific name commemorates the French naturalist L√©on Humblot. Description The upperparts are grey-brown while the underparts are pale with dark streaks. It has a dark crown with pale streaks and the bill and feet are yellow-orange. The bird is 14 cm long. It is often silent but has a soft trilling call. It differs from Muscicapa and other flycatchers in having plumage with a very soft and fluffy texture, and by having distinctive feathers on the crown that are a modification that represents the beginnings of the formation of a crest. Ecology Humblot's flycatcher feeds on insects which it catches by making short flights from a perch low in a tree or bush. Often, it will feed in groups of two or three. Little is known about its breeding habits; the only known nest was a cup built high in a tree which contained at least two young. Status Humblot's flycatcher has a very restricted range and is threatened because of destruction and degradation of the forest and the spread of introduced species such as the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleyanum), which could overwhelm native species, the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and rats which may raid the nests. The population of 10,000-19,000 individuals is decreasing and the species is classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered.

According to a 2011 Gallup survey on religion, among the Eastern Orthodox of Moldova, 86% belonged to the Moldovan Orthodox Church, while 13% belonged to the Bessarabian Orthodox Church. Eparchies of the Metropolis of Chi»ôinƒÉu and All Moldova Eparchies of the Metropolis of Bessarabia History =Middle Ages= The first attested Christian organization the territory of the later Principality of Moldavia was the Catholic Diocese of Cumania in the southern part of the region, dating from 1227, at a time when the Kingdom of Hungary attempted to extend its control in the region. However, as early as 1234, Orthodox Vlachs are mentioned in the diocese, having their own \\"pseudobishops\\" (or rural bishops). The diocese was soon destroyed by the Mongol invasion of 1241, and only beginning with the late 13th century did Catholic missionaries become active again in southern Moldavia. In the early stages of its statehood (14th century), Moldavia was under the authority of the Orthodox bishop of Halych. Around 1371, during the reign of La»õcu, the court passed to Catholicism and a Catholic diocese was founded at Siret. The conversion was reverted soon after, with voivode Roman I of Moldavia installing a local cleric as bishop. By 1391 a new Orthodox metropolitan, Joseph of Belgorod, had been ordained by the archbishop of Halych. The move was opposed by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, who in 1391 named Theodosius as Metropolitan bishop of Moldavia. Around 1392, the same position was given by the Patriarch to Jeremiah. The Moldovan rulers refused to accept either and banished the latter from Moldavia, action resulting in an anathema against Moldavia issued by the Patriarch of Constantinople. A further two patriarchal missions were sent to Moldavia in 1395 and 1397 in a bid to regain authority over the local church. As the Mitropolitan see remained canonically vacant in 1394, the Moldavian priest Peter was named exarch over Moldavia by Constantinople, a move that probably was not accepted by the local rulers either. In 1401 the voivode Alexandru cel Bun obtained from the Patriarchate of Constantinople the recognition of Joseph, whose anathema had been raised on the occasion, as head of an autonomous Metropolitan Moldavian See at Suceava, with 3 bishoprics and jurisdiction over the entire territory of the Principality of Moldavia. The Catholics were also favoured by Alexandru and in 1417 a new Roman Catholic bishop was ordained at Baia, with authority mainly over Hungarian and German merchants in that market town. Moldavia also sent delegates to the Catholic Council of Constance in 1421. All these caused problems for the Metropolitan bishop, who was called to Constantinople in 1415 but had to wait until 1471, when the new patriarch was enthroned, to have his position reconfirmed. Moldavia's extensive diplomatic relations with the Pope did not contribute to good relations between the Moldavian church ad its direct superior, the Patriarch of Constantinople. Towards 1436, the Pope named a Moldavian, Gregory, as Archbishop of Moldavia, however he was never recognized by the rulers of the country, and disappeared from history. Moldavian delegates were also present at the Council of Florence, where Damian, the Moldavian Orthodox metropolitan, signed the Union of the Western and Eastern Churches.Sinodul de la Ferrara-Floren»õa »ôi rom√¢nii (1438-1439) Descriptio Moldaviae at wikisource.org From the 15th century the Patriarchate of Constantinople was forced to content itself with subordination to the Ottoman Sultanate, the Metropolitan of Moldavia being ordained since by the Archbishop of Ohrid. =Modern times= The 17th century saw the adoption of the national language in the church (when many religious texts were translated in Romanian, especially during the time of Metropolitan Dosoftei), which replaced Old Slavonic language.An introduction to the Christian Orthodox churches Routledge encyclopedia of translation studies In 1677, the seat of the Metropolis of Moldavia was permanently moved to Ia»ôi.Mitropolia Moldovei aniverseaza 327 de ani de la stabilirea sediului sau in Iasi =19th century= Bessarabia, the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia, was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1812, including the territory constituting the Chi≈üinƒÉu Eparchy, which was reorganized and placed under the Russian Orthodox Church. Its first Metropolitan was Gavril BƒÉnulescu-Bodoni, a popular promoter of the Romanian language and culture. Its last metropolitan was Anastasios, the future first- hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. =20th century= In January 1918 Bessarabia proclaimed independence as Moldavian Democratic Republic and in April 1918 it united with Romania. The territory of modern-day Republic of Moldova was then made a part of the Metropolitanate of Bessarabia, under the Romanian Orthodox Church. After World War II, Bessarabia was occupied by the USSR, which was hostile to the church. The body of the church was downgraded to a \\"Bishopric of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Moldova\\" under the Russian Orthodox Church. After 1991, the Bishop of BƒÉl»õi, Petru, led a movement that re-instated the former Metropolitan See of Bessarabia, reviving the one existing in the interwar period, and placing it under the authority of the Romanian Orthodox Church, but retaining a larger degree of autonomy than the other Metropolitanates of the Romanian Orthodox Church. In October 1992, the Bishopric of Chi»ôinƒÉu was elevated to Metropolitan Church of Chi»ôinƒÉu and all Moldova and granted autonomy by the Russian Orthodox Church. Later the state re-registered the churches and refused to register the Metropolitanate of Bassarabia, which led to a lengthy court action that lasted until the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Moldovan state to register it, in 2004. An uneasy peace exists nowadays between the two Churches.

It belongs to the grotesque or industrial genre of early sans-serif designs. Like many early sans-serifs, it forms a sprawling family designed at different times. The family was popular in British trade printing, especially its series 215 and 216 regular and bold weights from around 1926, which have been credited to its American-born engineering manager Frank Hinman Pierpont. Several weights have been digitised.  History and design  Monotype Grotesque is a large family of fonts, including very bold, condensed and extended designs, created at different times. Monotype offered a sans-serif capital alphabet as its fourth typeface cut; others were developed later. Like many early sans-serif designs, it is strongly irregular, with designs created at different times that are adapted to suit each width and style at the expense of consistency. Monotype executive Dan Rhatigan has commented that it \\"was never really conceived as a family in the first place, so consistency wasn't a goal.\\" The inspiration for Monotype Grotesque 215 and 216 has been described as the popular 'Venus' family from the Bauer Type Foundry or 'Ideal', from the H. Berthold AG foundry, which is according to Indra Kupferschmid a Venus clone. Its name descends from William Thorowgood's 1832 face titled \\"Grotesque.\\" Monotype Grotesque has standard characteristics of the 'industrial' sans-serifs of the period. Uppercase characters are of near equal width, the G has a spur in some weights, and the M in the non-condensed weights is square. The 'a' is double- storey. Early fonts have a double-storey 'g' following British tradition and 215 and 216 a single-storey 'g' on the German model. Monotype Grotesque was somewhat overshadowed from the late 1920s due to the arrival of new sans- serifs such as Kabel, Futura and Gill Sans, also by Monotype. With their cleaner, more constructed and geometric appearance, these designs came to define graphic design of the 1930s, especially in Britain and parts of Europe. (Pierpont was irritated by Monotype advisor Stanley Morison's enthusiasm for marketing Gill Sans, saying that he could \\"see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable.\\") However, while it never achieved the popularity of Akzidenz Grotesk, it remained a steady seller through the twentieth century. A particular revival of interest took place after the war, and it is often found in avant-garde printing of this period from western and central Europe, such as the journal Typographica designed by Herbert Spencer, since (unlike Akzidenz-Grotesk) it was available from the outset for hot metal machine composition.  Post-war period  With the rise of popularity of neo-grotesque sans-serif typefaces such as Helvetica in the 1950s, which featured a more homogeneous design across a range of styles, Monotype attempted to redesign Monotype Grotesque around 1956 under the name of 'New Grotesque' in a more contemporary style after Pierpont's death in 1937. The project proved abortive (Monotype's obituary of Morison described him as having agreed to it 'without any great enthusiasm'), and did not progress beyond the release of some alternative characters. Monotype ultimately came to license Univers, Adrian Frutiger's extremely comprehensive new sans-serif family, from Deberny & Peignot. Historian James Mosley has commented that \\"orders unexpectedly revived\\" for it around 1960, partly as Univers was only slowly made available on the popular Monotype system, \\"or maybe they did not want to use the rather bland Univers anyway.\\" Mosley wrote in 1999 that the interest in its eccentric design \\"represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties,\\" and that \\"its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of the chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the...prettiness of Gill Sans\\". Phyllis Margaret Handover, a historian and Stanley Morison's assistant, listed some dates for the family in a 1950s article. Monotype would later use aspects of Monotype Grotesque and New Grotesque as an inspiration for Arial, a new design styled to generally be very similar to Helvetica.  Metal type weights  Monotype Grotesque formed a sprawling family with a range of weights sold at different times. The following is a list of known series numbers, their state in post-war specimens and dates where available. * Regular, series 215 with oblique (1926), single- storey 'g' * Bold, series 216 with oblique (1926), single-storey 'g', * Bold, series 73, different design with a non-strikethrough 'Q'. * Light, series 126 with oblique, single-storey 'g'. * Medium, series 51 (1910), with the 'g' double-storey. Not digitised in the \\"Monotype Grotesque\\" releases. * Condensed, series 33 (1905), a medium weight with a single-storey 'g'. Stephen Coles comments that this series is \\"really two different typefaces. Note sizes below 14pt are very different than Large Composition and Display Matrices which are essentially Alternate Gothic No. 3. Neither are part of the digital version of Monotype Grotesque.\\" Described by Handover as a narrower companion to series 15. * Condensed, series 318, more condensed than the above, a medium weight with a single-storey 'g'. * Condensed or Extra Condensed, series 383, even more condensed, a medium weight with a single-storey 'g' and no vertical spur on the 'G'. * Bold Condensed, series 15 with oblique (1903), double- storey 'g'. Very similar to \\"Headline Bold\\" (below) but different 't' and 'r'. * Bold Condensed, series 81, double-storey 'g'. * Bold Extended, series 150 with italic (1921, 1923-4), double-storey 'g', single-storey 'g' and 'a' in italic. * Light Condensed, series 274, single-storey 'g'. Titling weights (capitals only): * Condensed Titling, series 523. * Bold Titling, series 524. * Bold Condensed Titling, series 527, z-form ampersand, strikethrough 'Q'. * Bold Condensed titling, series 166, more condensed than series 15, z-form ampersand, non-strikethrough 'Q'.

Founded in 1928 in Stoke-on-Trent it initially specialised in concrete engineering before expanding into general contracting and house-building. Kier was listed as a public company on the London Stock Exchange from 1963 until it was acquired by Beazer in 1986. After a period under the ownership of Hanson plc, it was bought out by its management in 1992, expanded its housing interests, and was relisted on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the early 21st century, it expanded through acquisitions, and in September 2018 Kier was ranked, by turnover, as the second biggest UK construction contractor, behind Balfour Beatty. It was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until its share price plunged following a failed rights issue in late 2018, after which it started a restructuring, cost-cutting and disposals programme. History =Foundation= The company was founded by Jorgen Lotz and Olaf Kier, Danish engineers, under the name Lotz & Kier in 1928, and it was based in Stoke-on- Trent. A few years later Lotz withdrew from the company, but Olaf Kier retained a semblance of his identity by including Lotz's initials in the organisation's new name, J.L. Kier & Co Ltd, which remained the company's principal title for over four decades. =Pre-World War II= By the late 1930s Kier had moved its head office to Belgravia in Westminster, and thereby became neighbours to many of Britain's leading construction engineering consultants and contractors, who had formed a substantial coterie in Westminster for professionals and businessmen engaged in civil engineering. Immediate neighbours included Marples Ridgeway (builders of Hammersmith Flyover) and Edmund Nuttall (builders of both Mersey road tunnels). Concrete engineering During its first 35 years, Kier became identified with certain civil engineering specialisms, such as contiguous cylindrical reinforced concrete grain silos and cement silos, using continuously sliding formwork; commencing with those at Barking in 1929, followed by grain silos at Northampton, Peterborough, Melksham, Gloucester and Witham; and cement silos at Norwich, Cambridge, Trinidad, and in India.pps 28 & 29, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn Such specialist work was part of a pattern that quickly developed in the company's operations during that period, namely the undertaking of innovative, state-of-the-art civil engineering techniques at the forefront of modern technology.

They were responsible for the reinforced concrete and general building.pps 44 & 45, Kier Corporate Blue Book, 1955 Edtn When this project was completed in 1935 it became widely renowned as the finest example of this form of construction for residential purposes. When Le Corbusier himself visited Highpoint in 1935 he said, \\"This beautiful building .... at Highgate is an achievement of the first rank.\\" And American critic Henry Russell Hitchcock called it, \\"One of the finest, if not absolutely the finest, middle- class housing projects in the world\\" (in 1970 both Highpoint blocks were classified Grade I listed buildings). Kier dynasty Olaf Kier sought to retain family leaders at the head of the organisation. However, his son by his first marriage was killed in a riding accident in 1945. Then, during the 1950s, Olaf's nephew, Mogens Kier, joined the firm's management structure, but did not progress to a leading position in the company. Olaf died in an accident in 1986, aged 87; and Mogens died in 2003.Kierlink =Post-World War II= J.L. Kier & Co Ltd remained a private company until 1963 when it obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange and became a public company. Its offer for shares was many times oversubscribed. The Kier family retained a significant majority of the holding. In 1973 Kier merged with W. & C. French to form French Kier but within the French division there were heavy losses on fixed-price motorway contracts and land development. A long-serving Kier engineer, John Mott, was appointed chief executive in order to revive the group's fortunes. Following an abortive bid for Abbey in 1985, French Kier itself was the subject of a hotly contested bid by Beazer, which eventually succeeded in January 1986.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. Five years later (1991) Hanson plc bought Beazer plc and made an early decision to dispose of the contracting arm, now known simply as Kier. This was the subject of a management buyout in July 1992, with Hanson retaining a 10 per cent stake. In 1993 Kier decided to re-enter the housing market with the ¬£30m acquisition of Twigden Homes. This was followed by acquisitions of the southern division of Miller Homes in 1996, Bellwinch in 1998, and Allison Homes in 2001. By 2004, Kier housing sales were over 1,000 units a year. Kier was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1996.Kier Group London Stock Exchange =21st century= In 2009, Mivan Kier, Kier's Romanian joint venture with the Northern Irish group Mivan, which invested in real estate projects in Bucharest, requested bankruptcy protection due to debts of ‚Ç¨20 million.\\"Mivan Kier JV declares insolvency\\", Bucharest Business Review, 9 August 2009\\"V√¢nd avans de locuin≈£ƒÉ\\", Evenimentul Zilei, 8 September 2009 In 2013, Kier acquired the services firm May Gurney for ¬£221 million,Kier completes ¬£221m deal for May Gurney The Courier becoming the then fourth largest contracting firm in the UK (behind Balfour Beatty, Carillion and Laing O'Rourke).May Gurney joins Kier Group Construction Index, 8 July 2013 In June 2015 Kier completed the acquisition of Mouchel, a business which included infrastructure services and business services divisions, for ¬£265 million; Mouchel Infrastructure Services was rebranded as Mouchel Consulting, and sold to WSP Global in October 2016. In July 2017 Kier acquired McNicholas Construction, another UK infrastructure services provider. 2018-2020 financial difficulties After the liquidation of rival contracting and services provider Carillion in January 2018, Kier took on some Carillion staff and contracts: 150 Carillion workers employed on smart motorway joint ventures with Kier became Kier employees; 51 Carillion employees working on seven HS2 civil engineering packages awarded to the CEK joint venture were allowed to join Kier/Eiffage. However, because Kier shared characteristics that contributed to Carillion's collapse - problem contracts, rising debts, and use of reverse factoring supply chain finance - City hedge funds began to 'short' Kier's shares; 10.9% were shorted by 30 August 2018, later rising to 18%, though Kier's position was not seen to be as risky as Carillion's. The 2018 results were in line with City expectations - showing a pre-tax profit of ¬£137m from stable revenue of ¬£4.5 billion - with Kier outlining clear debt reduction plans. On 15 November 2018, Kier announced the ¬£24m sale of its Australian road assets business KHSA to joint venture partner Downer, saying sale proceeds would help reduce net debt \\\\- ¬£624m at 31 October 2018. However, on 30 November, Kier announced a ¬£264m rights issue, priced at 409p, to pay down net debts; the announcement led to Kier shares dropping almost 33%, cutting Kier's stock market value by ¬£329m to ¬£492m. The slide continued; on 3 December shares were trading around 40% lower than before the rights issue announcement. On 5 December, Kier was demoted from the FTSE 250 Index, and its share price dropped below the rights issue price, making it cheaper for investors to buy shares in the open market than in the rights issue, and leaving underwriters (Numis, Peel Hunt, Citigroup, HSBC and Santander) facing losses. Shares were also subject to renewed 'shorting'. On 10 December, shares closed at 376.4p, a 15-year low. Only 38% of the rights issue was taken up, with shares still trading below the rights issue price, at 385p, on 19 December. Following the rights issue result on 20 December 2018, shares fell by 13% to a 15-year low of 335p, but later recovered. They were trading at 529p on 11 January 2019, when some shareholders sought changes in Kier's leadership team. CEO Haydn Mursell subsequently resigned with immediate effect on 22 January (former Wates Group CEO Andrew Davies was announced as his successor on 19 March, taking up the post on 15 April 2019). In a trading statement Kier said the rights issue had helped reduce year-end net debt to ¬£130m compared with ¬£239m at the end of the previous year; average month-end net debt for the six months to 31 December 2018 was ¬£370m, as compared with ¬£410m for the previous six months. On 28 January 2019, Kier shares dropped 4% after reports it would sell its housing maintenance arm to cut debt, and the company was also reducing its waste management activities. On 11 March 2019, Kier revised its average net debt for the six months to December 2018 by over ¬£50m from ¬£130m to ¬£180.5m, raising average month-end net debt over the period from ¬£370m to ¬£430m. These revisions followed ¬£10.3m in adjustments to the group's hedging activities, and ¬£40.2m in relation to development assets held for resale. It also warned of ¬£25m of additional costs on its Broadmoor Hospital redevelopment. Shares fell by 12% to 437p. On 20 March 2019, Kier's half-year results showed a pre-tax loss of ¬£35.5m in the second half of 2018 with revenues flat at ¬£2,064m. As well as the Broadmoor provision, Kier lost ¬£26m on a disputed waste collection contract which has been cut short, while integrating the McNicholas business and Kier restructuring added a further ¬£15.4m to costs. Kier also highlighted \\"volume pressures\\" in its highways, utilities and housing maintenance markets. In a 3 June 2019 profit warning, Kier said operating profits would be ¬£25m lower than previously expected, causing its share price to fall over 40% \\\\- trading at about 150p, less than half the rights issue price, on 6 June. Shares fell by over a third on 14 June, closing at 130.8p, after reports that Kier was looking to sell its housebuilding division. On 17 June, Kier confirmed the housing division sale, and said it would wind down its property business and planned to exit the facilities management and environmental services markets \\"in due course\\". CEO Andrew Davies's business review included 1,200 job cuts. Kier's share price fell 17% to 108p, a level not seen since the company's 1996 flotation, and its shares were subject to renewed 'shorting' with one analyst saying \\"the consensus in the market is that Kier will go bust\\"; on 15 July 2019, Kier shares were the most 'shorted' on the London Stock Exchange, with shares falling 12.7% to 72.95p. Amid concerns about Kier's future, the company was dropped from two major development schemes, in Leeds and London. In a trading update on 1 August 2019, Kier said average month-end net debt for the 2019 financial year was ¬£422 million, with revenues ¬£100m lower, and, after significant interest in its housing division, said it had started the sale process (Guy Hands' Terra Firma Capital Partners was later reported to be among the bidders to acquire Kier Living). It also announced the appointment of a new CFO, Simon Kesterton (adept at \\"the disposal of non-core assets, the reduction of overheads and cost control\\"), with effect from 19 September 2019. On 19 September 2019, Kier announced a ¬£245m pre-tax loss on revenues of ¬£4.5bn for the year to 30 June 2019, resulting from ¬£341m in impairment costs and write-downs related to preparing businesses for sale, restructuring and loss-making contracts. The continuing restructuring had resulted in over 751 lay-offs, with a further 450 roles set to be axed. The group also confirmed chairman Philip Cox would step down once a successor had been appointed (in December 2019, it was confirmed former Royal Mail FD Matthew Lester would succeed Cox with effect from 1 January 2020). In October 2019, Kier announced it was selling its Tempsford Hall headquarters in Bedfordshire to raise cash from its property assets. At the group's AGM in November 2019, shareholders objected to CEO Andrew Davies's ¬£2.6m annual remuneration package and an associated long-term incentive scheme. Half-year results announced on 5 March 2020 showed Kier made a pre-tax loss of ¬£41.2m in the final six months of 2019 (marginally better than 2018's restated ¬£45.3m loss); revenues were down 9% to ¬£1,866m (2018: ¬£2,053m). The cost-cutting process begun in 2018 had cut 1,200 jobs with another 50 set to leave by 30 June 2020. The sale of Kier Living was in progress, as was the process of closing Kier's Tempsford Hall head office, set to complete in June 2020. On 24 March 2020, as the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear, Kier's board of directors took a three- month 20% pay cut to mitigate the financial impact of the crisis, and warned employees' salaries might also be cut. On 30 March, Kier announced all 6,500 Kier employees would have their base salary reduced by between 7.5% and 25% for three months from 1 April; it stepped up its cost reduction programme, bringing forward the closure of Tempsford Hall to 30 April (head office functions were transferred to Manchester in mid April), and paused the sale of its housebuilding business, Kier Living. Kier also closed its Reading office with the loss of up to 40 jobs. On 1 July 2020, Kier announced it was considering a further rights issue to raise cash as average net debt had risen due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; average month-end net debt was up from ¬£395m in December 2019 to ¬£440m, and could rise to ¬£485m. Further job cuts were also likely. On 17 September 2020, Kier announced a ¬£225.5m loss on the year to 30 June 2020, on revenues down 15% to ¬£3,476m. The fall was partly due to COVID-19 impacts as well as 'challenging' market conditions throughout the year. Group headcount had been reduced by 1,700. Operations The company has four divisions: Kier Construction, Kier Services, Kier Residential and Kier Property. These are further split into smaller companies. Major projects Projects involving the company have included Highpoint I completed in 1935, the North Terminal at Gatwick Airport completed in 1988, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project completed in 1998, Hairmyres Hospital completed in 2001, High Speed 1 completed in 2007, the Castlepoint shopping centre in Bournemouth in 2003, the UK Supreme Court in London completed in 2009 and Snowhill Phase 2 in Birmingham completed in 2009. Kier Group is also involved in HS2 lots C2 and C3, working as part of a joint venture with Eiffage, due to complete in 2031. Controversies Kier was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist, and was among 14 issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office. Subsequently, Kier was among eight businesses involved in the 2014 launch of the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme, condemned as a \\"PR stunt\\" by the GMB union, and described by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee as \\"an act of bad faith\\". In December 2017, Unite announced it had issued high court proceedings against four former chairmen of the Consulting Association, included Danny O'Sullivan of Kier, alleging breach of privacy, defamation and Data Protection Act offences. Unite also said it was taking action against 12 major contractors including Kier. Following a devastating fire in the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, the school terminated its ¬£25 million restoration contract with Kier on 29 June 2018. Kier was the main contractor in the failed DG One leisure centre in Dumfries. In October 2018, Kier was named as a 'poor payer' at a Parliamentary inquiry into small businesses, failing to pay 48% of invoices due within their agreed terms, leading some suppliers to refuse to work for the company. In November 2019, Kier and subsidiary McNicholas Construction Services were suspended from the Prompt Payment Code for failing to pay 95% of all supplier invoices within 60 days. Kier Construction was reinstated in December 2019; Kier Highways and Kier Infrastructure & Overseas were reinstated in June 2020; Kier Integrated Services was reinstated in August 2020, but McNicholas Construction Services remained suspended.

Biography Emma Helen Blair was born on September 12, 1851, on Menasha, Wisconsin. Although born in Wisconsin, she attended high school in Westfield, Massachusetts. In 1871, she returned to Wisconsin and enrolled in Ripon College, where she graduated in 1874. After graduation she taught in public school for two years and then moved to Milwaukee, where she worked as a journalist. In 1892, she began postgraduate work in history, economics and sociology at the University of Wisconsin. She later became a librarian at the Wisconsin Historical Society. In 1894, Blair resigned from the library staff and became assistant to Reuben Gold Thwaites. Thwaites was the translator of the 73-volume work Jesuit Relations (1896‚Äì1901). This massive work consisted of English translations of the annual reports issued by the superior of the Jesuit missions in New France to the Jesuit overseer in France between the years 1632 and 1673. Blair participated in the editing and annotations. After her work on the Jesuit Relations, she assisted in the editing of the journal of Father Louis Hennepin and of the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition, still working with Thwaites. Title page for one of the many volumes of The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 In 1903, she began work on the project she is most remembered for, the translation and editing of Philippine historical documents that were published in the 55-volume series The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 (1903‚Äì09). Her collaborator was James A. Robertson, later librarian at the Philippines Library in Manila. Most of the documents in this enormous collection had not previously been translated into English. Volumes 15 and 16 consist of Antonio de Morga's History of the Philippine Islands From Their Discovery by Magellan in 1521 to the Beginning of the XVII Century, an extremely valuable source on the early history of the islands. Her last work was the translation and editing of documents for The Indian Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Region of the Great Lakes (2 vols., 1911‚Äì12). This work included Nicolas Perrot's Memoir: The Habits and Customs of the American Indians. Just days after receiving an advance copy of volume 1 from the bindery, Blair died in Madison, Wisconsin on September 25, 1911. According to her obituary in the Madison Democrat, :Miss Blair became by dint of native ability and years of preparatory toil one of the most expert historical editors in the county. She had acquired a complete mastery of the French and Spanish languages. Her literary style was incisive, her historical judgment clear and accurate, and her knowledge of the details of typography quite unusual. In recognition of these qualities Ripon College and the State University honored her with degrees.Madison Democrat, September 26, 1911 References External links *Her entry at the Dictionary of Wisconsin History *Obituary, Madison Democrat, September 26, 1911 American book editors 1851 births 1911 deaths People from Menasha, Wisconsin Ripon College (Wisconsin) alumni Writers from Wisconsin American women historians American women journalists ","title":"Emma Helen Blair"},{"id":"9760426","text":"The history of the Jews in Hadramaut stretches back to ancient times.

Uralsib is said to have been \\"roiled by mismanagement\\", with its founder Tsvetkov agreeing to step down in 2015 in return for a bailout, as the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy and having its banking license revoked. During his time as chairman Tsvetkov became known for his application of New Age philosophy to company management, which included requiring all employees to read books by a self-help guru and holding spiritual seminars to determine promotions. An 82% stake in Uralsib was sold to Vladimir Kogan in November 2015 to avoid bankruptcy. As part of a rescue plan, Russia's Deposit Insurance Agency also agreed to a $224 million rescue package for the bank.

Under this program, RCAS instrumented and operated various ships and stations on the Air Force Eastern Test Range with electronic tracking and telemetry equipment. The instrumented ships and stations tracked incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and, using radar or telemetry, also tracked manned or unmanned space vehicles orbiting the earth. Tracking stations MTP instrumented and operated the following tracking stations: CCAFS (designated AFE71), Grand Bahama Island (AFE73), Eleuthera Island (AFE74), San Salvador Island (AFE75), Mayaguana Island (AFE76), Grand Turk Island (AFE77), Antigua Island (AFE86), Chaguaramus, Trinidad (AFE87), Ascension Island (AFE83) and Mah√© in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean (AFE89). The tracking station planned for South Africa was never fully instrumented and eventually found to be redundant.??? The tracking station, Station 13, in South Africa (at Bapsfontein near Pretoria) operated from about 1960 until 1969 and had a tracking radar, telemetry site and GLOTRAC Instrumented ships The following small diesel- powered ships were instrumented with tracking equipment: Sword Knot, Rose Knot, Timber Hitch, Coastal Crusader, Coastal Sentry, and Sampam Hitch. In 1964 three very highly advanced instrumented ships were added to the MTP inventory: the USAFS General H. H. Arnold and USAFS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg (both Type C4 ships), as well as the USAS American Mariner (a converted Liberty ship). These tracking ships, when operated under the direct supervision and operational control of PAA GMRD, were termed \\"Ocean Range Vessel\\" (ORV). Operations and support The management, logistics and infrastructure of the tracking stations were under the control of PAA GMRD while electronic equipment, such as the tracking radars, was under the control of RCAS personnel. Some bases, such as those at Antigua and at Chagaramus, Trinidad, were located in populated areas and, in some cases, technical personnel were permitted to bring their families with them. Some tracking stations, such as the one at Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, were inhospitable and unpopulated and, as a result, it was not feasible for technical personnel to bring their families with them. However, since the Ascension Island tracking station grew to be a very large one and required a large number of maintenance laborers, temporary rotating forces of workers were recruited from tiny Saint Helena Island, located about 800 miles to the south. Tracking ships were likewise managed by PAA GMRD personnel in areas of operation and logistics. Maintenance and operation of technical equipment, such as radars and related equipment, were under the operational control of RCAS. Tracking ships normally operated in the South Atlantic Ocean, and the port of Recife, Brazil, contained a small contingent of PAA GMRD and RCAS personnel to assist technical personnel when their vessel arrived in the port for fuel, U.S. mail, logistics, or a recreation period. Providing in-port periods of rest and relaxation for technical personnel and crew members was a priority requirement, since the tracking ships often remained at sea for a month or more. The Vandenberg and Arnold also operated in the Pacific Ocean (North and South). They supported missile launches out of Vandenberg AFB and other locations. Since RCA employed over a thousand personnel in Florida and downrange on the tracking stations and ships, PAA GMRD provided administrative personnel at each major location to authorize and provide travel orders for the constant movement by air of technical personnel. Air transport on prop- driven aircraft was initially provided by the MATS (Military Air Transport Service) and later by the MAC (Military Airlift Command).

The River Tawe flows past Ynysforgan so it is not unreasonable to speculate that it is the river in question. Several other nearby locations also use the term Ynys in their names including Ynystawe (the neighbouring village to Ynysforgan), Ynystanglws Farm (near Ynystawe), and Ynysmeudwy (near Pontardawe). However, as historically insignificant as Ynysforgan may seem it holds a hidden gem unknown to most locals and has its name embedded in the annals of Welsh time. In the latter part of the Middle Ages (circa 1330 - 1403) Ynysforgan was the home of Hopcyn ap Tomas ab Einion. This clearly indicates the name Ynysforgan extends back further than the 15th century and given the 'modernisation' of language it's conceivable its name is derived from old Welsh. Historians have speculated that ab Einion was responsible for a manuscript titled the Red Book of Hergest which is one of the most important medieval Welsh language manuscripts. Furthermore, in 1403 ab Einion was summoned to Carmarthen by none other than Owain Glynd≈µr, the last true Prince of Wales to shed light on his fate by bringing his knowledge and expertise to bare by interpreting old bardic prophecies. Before 1963 Ynysforgan essentially comprised the main Swansea to Brecon road (now Clydach Road) with houses on either side. The 1911 census shows the address as 'Clydack Road'. The 'newer' houses behind Clydach Road were built in late 1960 starting with Garth View, followed by Elizabeth Close, Ian's Walk and Orpheus Road. The builders name was Emrys Davies of Neath who was a sole trader employing skilled tradesmen. It is believed that the road names Elizabeth Close, Ian's Walk and Andrews Crescent are attributable to Mr Davies' relatives. Garth View takes its name from its aspect facing the hill opposite, known colloquially as 'The Garth'. Orpheus Road is probably in recognition of the famous Morriston Orpheus Choir. The old Swansea Tram system extended up the Swansea valley as far as Llanllienwen Road where there was a halt. With the building of the M4 motorway in 1973 the geography of Ynysforgan changed dramatically. The motorway essentially cut the village in two resulting in the demolition of the old Sunday School which stood (roughly) in the vicinity of the M4 exit slip road straight on from Clydach Road and a new Sunday school was built at the top of Garth View and Christopher Road. Up until the mid-1970s there stood a grand house - Glyncollen - in its own grounds at the top of Garth View. Glyncollen was originally accessed by a long drive that joined the lower end of Llanllienwen Road, but this access was blocked when the motorway divided the village. In the 1930s Glyncollen House was the residence of the late Captain Sidney Davies, Managing Director of the Forest and Worcester Tinplate Works at Morriston - a brother of the late Alderman D. J. Davies of \\"Firgrove\\", Llanllienwen Road, a former Mayor of Swansea. He was followed as owner-occupier by the late Doctor and Mrs. N. E. Edwards-Jones, in the 1940s. The house was abandoned in the early 1970s and fell into ruin, only to be demolished later that decade. The grounds were taken over by the council and became a local amenity. Ynysforgan used to lie on both the main Brecon to Swansea Canal which was navigable until the late 1950s and a Swansea Valley railway line. The canal was filled in and covered over in the 1960s and the route of the railway line has now been used as the Swansea valley by-pass road. There were several relics of World War II such as pillboxes and manholes along the canal: these were demolished when the canal was filled in.

It stars Ricardo Dar√≠n, Soledad Villamil, Ulises Dumont and Eduardo Blanco.. Plot In 1980, Jorge Pellegrini (Ricardo Dar√≠n), a young and talented Argentine writer, upon returning from a trip to Europe, is forced to write short love stories for \\"Cosas\\", a local, light-themed magazine, to aid his dire financial situation. His boss and best friend, Roberto (Eduardo Blanco), constantly censors Jorge's stories, by deciding which parts to take out or which stories not to print. Jorge's friend and mentor, Mastronardi, often visits the magazine HQ asking Roberto for work, but due to his history of courageous confrontation against the last military dictatorship in Argentina, he finds himself blacklisted and therefore cannot find work. In the showing of a short film, based on a story by Jorge, he meets Laura (Soledad Villamil), a passionate, beautiful and charming young girl who works as a waitress in a restaurant. He is instantly smitten by her, and she gives him her card. Days after, he receives news of the death of Mastronardi, and begins to write a story about his deceased friend. However, he experiences writer's block, and cannot get around to finish it. Jorge then finds the card Laura gave him, and decides to go the restaurant where she works. They go on a date to a bar, and they display chemistry and understanding, and Laura reveals that she has a boyfriend, an artist on a tour in Uruguay. Things go awry when the police raid the place and take Laura to jail, as she did not have her documents. Jorge then decides to be taken to jail himself in order to oversee Laura's safety. Upon their release, Laura and Jorge spend more and more time together, and Jorge reveals his feelings for Laura. She then tells him that she currently does not reciprocate, but she will call him if she \\"figures out any context\\" in which she could. Months go by and Jorge buries himself in his work, starts a diary (which he then throws away) and loses hope of receiving Laura's phone call. However, she then calls him and they arrange a date, at which she reveals that she wanted to be sure of not waiting for her boyfriend anymore before starting a new relationship. They kiss, make love and start a relationship. The first months are full of romance and passion; however, when Laura decides to quit her job to work for free at a local radio station, Jorge begins to lose interest in her, and is constantly bothered by the monotony of their relationship. To make matters worse, Laura has decided to make a great writer out of Jorge, and constantly pressures him to stop writing the short and simple-minded love stories and focus on a powerful book. When Jorge reaches the breaking point and cannot stand the current status of his relationship with Laura, he cheats on her with Carola. Laura finds out and leaves him immediately. Jorge, once again, buries himself in his work, until he receives news from Roberto that, due to restructuring, the magazine will no longer publish his stories. However, he is offered a job as the movie and theatre critic of the magazine, which he angrily refuses. He then finds the inspiration to finish Mastronardi's story and take it to the theatre. However, the play is a failure, and because of the effort he put in it, Jorge is heartbroken. Jorge then receives an emotional visit from Mastronardi's spirit, who asks him to look after his son, Sebasti√°n. In 1987, things have changed: Jorge has accepted the job offer as the movie and theatre critic, and Roberto is engaged to Marita, a friend of Laura's whom he met in a double date set by Jorge and Laura years before. Jorge is in a relationship with a new girl; however, he finds himself shocked when he receives news that Laura is to be married to her old boyfriend. This prompts Jorge to track Laura and, after spending a day together, they make love, and Laura then decides that she will get married anyway. Once again, years go by, and in the 1990s, a bitter and disillusioned Jorge, still works as a critic. However, due to his failures and disappointments, and to the loss of his spirit and morals, we learn that he now asks for money in return for writing favourable reviews. This works against him when Laura, one of the producers of the movie he asked money to write a favourable review for, personally delivers him the money, and looks at him with disgust. One day at the office, due to a disagreement, veteran political journalist M√°rquez (Ulises Dumont) has a heated exchange with his boss, young Micky (Rodrigo de la Serna) and is fired. This then prompts Sebasti√°n, Mastronardi's son, to blame Jorge for his father's death. Unable to cope with guilt, and after realizing how much he has changed, Jorge attempts suicide. This attempt, however, is frustrated by Roberto, who arrives just in time to save him. After the suicide attempt, there is a surprise party, at which the employees of Cosas decide to donate one twelfth of their salaries to M√°rquez. Laura and Jorge meet once again, and share a long talk about their lives, hopes and crushed dreams. The movie ends with a hint that Jorge and Laura will give their relationship one last chance. Jorge, reinvigorated, and looking like a happy man for the first time in years, watches her taxi depart with a broad smile. He is then greeted by his friends, M√°rquez, Sebasti√°n and Roberto, and tells them of the new love story he is planning to write.

His father was a miner. He began his career writing for amateur companies, while working as a bus conductor. In 1989 he took up writing full-time. He wrote over thirty plays, for both stage and radio, including Family Planning, All's Fair, and Errogenous Zones. He often appeared in his own work, playing characters such as \\"Teddy\\" in Granny Annie, and also appeared in pantomime. One of Vickery's best-known comedies was One O‚Äôclock from the House, in which the plot centred around preparations for a funeral. It was performed by many amateur groups. His one-person play, Sleeping with Mickey, was adapted for television in 1994, starring Brenda Blethyn. In collaboration with Mal Pope, Vickery co-wrote the musical Amazing Grace, which was premi√®red in 2005 and dealt with the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh revival.

Subcellular fractions can be isolated by ultracentrifugation to provide molecular machinery that can be used in reactions in the absence of many of the other cellular components. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell internals have been used for creation of these simplified environments. These systems have enabled cell-free synthetic biology to emerge, providing control over what reaction is being examined, as well as its yield, and lessening the considerations otherwise invoked when working with more sensitive live cells. Types Cell-free systems may be divided into two primary classifications: cell extract-based, which remove components from within a whole cell for external use, and purified enzyme-based, which use purified components of the molecules known to be involved in a given process. The cell extract-based type are susceptible to problems like quick degradation of components outside their host, as shown in a study by Kitaoka et al. where a cell-free translation system based on Escherichia coli (E. coli), of the cell extract-based type, had the mRNA template degrade very quickly and led to the halt of protein synthesis. Preparation The methods of preparation vary between situations of both types of cell-free systems. =Cell extract‚Äìbased= Nobel prize winner Eduard Buchner was arguably the first to present a cell-free system using yeast extracts, but since then alternative sources have been found. E. coli, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocytes have all proven useful to create cell-free systems by extraction of their interior components. E. coli 30S extracts have been acquired, for example, by grinding the bacteria with alumina, followed by further cleaning. Similarly, wheat germ has been ground with acid-washed sand or powdered glass to open the cell membranes up. Rabbit reticulocytes have been lysed in a solution of MgCl and had the extract filtered away from the membranes by centrifugation. =Purified enzyme‚Äìbased= Cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation biosystems can be prepared by mixing a number of purified enzymes and coenzymes. For example, tightly coupled ribosomes, which are compact and highly active, have been extracted and refined from E. coli through sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. Uses Cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation biosystems are proposed as a new low-cost biomanufacturing platform compared to microbial fermentation used for thousands of years. Cell-free biosystems have several advantages suitable in industrial applications: * Very high product yields are usually accomplished without the formation of by-products or the synthesis of cell mass. For example, with an synthetic enzyme pathway, from the reaction with starch and water :C6H10O5 (l) + 7 H2O (l) ‚Üí 12 H2 (g) + 6 CO2 (g), :nearly 12 H has been produced per glucose unit of polysaccharides and water, three times of the theoretical yield of the best anaerobic hydrogen-producing microorganisms. * In vitro biosystems can implement some biological reactions that living microbes or chemical catalysts cannot implement before. For example, beta-1,4-glucosidic bond linked cellulose can be converted to alpha-1,4-glucosidic bond linked starch by a mixture of intracellular and extracellular enzymes in a single reaction container. * Enzymatic systems, without the barrier of cellular membrane, usually have faster reaction rates than microbial systems. For instance, enzymatic fuel cells usually have much higher power outputs than microbial fuel cells. * Enzyme cocktails can tolerate toxic compounds better than microorganisms. * Enzyme mixtures usually work under broad reaction conditions, such as high temperature, low pH, the presence of organic solvents or ionic liquids. =Protein synthesis= In vitro biosystems can be easily controlled and accessed without membranes. Notably, in work leading to a Nobel prize the Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment used a cell-free system, of the cell extract-based type, to incorporate chosen amino acids tagged radioactively into synthesized proteins with 30S extracted from E. coli. More recent studies, such as the study done by Spirin et al. with prokaryotic and eukaryotic version of their cell-free translation system, have also synthesized proteins with increased production, incorporating techniques like continuous flow to add materials and remove products. With such advances in yield, productivity applications have been expanded, such as the synthesis of fusion proteins to potentially serve as vaccines for B-cell lymphomas. Additionally, cell-free protein synthesis is becoming a new alternative choice for fast protein synthesis. =Metabolic manipulation= Engineering of metabolic processes have been achieved through cell-free systems. Bujara et al., for example, were able to use glycolytic network extracts, consisting of enzymes from E. coli that produced dihydroxyacetone phosphate, to analyze in real-time the metabolite concentrations while altering enzyme levels, with the end result of optimal production of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Further, Calhoun and Swartz were able to use a glycolytic intermediate to fuel a cell- free system, enabling relatively inexpensive ATP generation compared to reagent usage in phosphoenolpyruvate reactions. =Unnatural amino acid incorporation= Cell-free systems have also been used to incorporate unnatural amino acids. Shimizu et al. were able to change a stop codon to a sense codon by omitting the RF1 release factor, indicating ability to insert desired amino acids in unnatural situations. This is of use in systems where working inside a cell is problematic, such as the process of amino acid metabolism preventing specific labelling of amino acids that would be useful in multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Kigawa et al.were able to successfully label amino acids in a cell-free system where amino acid metabolism was no longer present, thus making such systems useful to NMR studies.

Life Albrecht Goes was born in 1908 in the Protestant rectory in Langenbeutingen. He spent his childhood there, but his mother died in 1911 and in 1915 he went to live with his grandmother in Berlin-Steglitz. He went to school there until 1919, when he moved to a school in G√∂ppingen. In 1922 he entered the theological seminary in Urach, and from 1922‚Äì1923 he attended the seminary in Sch√∂ntal. His room-mate there was Gerd Gaiser. He passed his university exams and in 1924 entered the advanced seminary in Urach. In 1926 he read German studies and History in T√ºbingen, then switched to Theology. In 1928 he went to Berlin to continue his Theology studies, and there he met and was influenced by Romano Guardini. In 1930 Goes was ordained for the Evangelical Church in W√ºrttemberg as a parson in Tuttlingen's main church, and in 1931 became a vicar at the Martinskirche in Stuttgart. In 1933 he began his first rectorate in Unterbalzheim in Illertissen. In the same year he married Elisabeth Schneider, with whom he had three daughters: Christin, Brigitte and Rose. In 1938 he took up a rectorate in Gebersheim (which today is a part of the city of Leonberg). His involvement with the German army during the Second World War began when he was conscripted in 1940. He was trained as a radio operator and sent to Romania. From 1942 to 1945 he was a clergyman in hospitals and prisons in Russia, Poland, Hungary and Austria. After the war he returned to his ministry in Gebersheim, and he stayed there until he quit the Church in 1953 to become a full-time writer; from then on he preached twice a month. In 1954 he moved back to Stuttgart- Rohr. He campaigned against the rearmament of Germany by, for example, adding his signature to the 'German Manifesto' of the Paul's Church Movement (along with, among others, Gustav Heinemann). In 1958 he was inaugurated into the Berlin Academy of Arts. Goes's first volumes of poetry were Verse in 1932 and Der Hirte (The Herdsman) in 1934. The story Unruhige Nacht (Restless Night) was published in 1950. The novel Das Brandopfer (The Burnt Offering) examined the Holocaust during the Third Reich from the perspective of an ordinary butcher's wife, who eventually tries to find justice by sacrificing herself. The book, written in simple language, is considered a significant contribution to the dialogue and reconciliation between Jews and Christians in the post- Third Reich era. This was recognised in 1978 when Goes was awarded the Buber- Rosenzweig Medal. Both Unruhige Nacht and Das Brandopfer were turned into films. Unruhige Nacht was translated into English as Arrow to the Heart and adapted for broadcast by BBC Television in the United Kingdom in 1952. Albrecht Goes's work is often compared with that of Albrecht Haushofer, Reinhold Schneider, Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der and Gertrud von Le Fort. His 100th birthday was celebrated with new scholarly books and editions of his works, and an extensive programme of events. Albrecht Goes was buried at the Prag Cemetery in Stuttgart on 28 February 2000. Works * Verse; Stuttgart 1932 * Der Hirte. Gedichte; Leipzig 1934 * Heimat ist gut.

Essentially only one model of the large luxury four-cylinder motorcycle, with slight variations, was made from first to last. Origin Having sold Henderson Motorcycle to Ignaz Schwinn's Excelsior Motor Manufacturing & Supply Company, founder William G. Henderson continued to work there until 1919, when differences of opinion regarding the design direction of Henderson motorcycles led to his resignation from Excelsior. In the fall of 1919, with the support of Max M. Sladkin of Haverford Cycle Co., Henderson started the Ace Motor Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Ace motorcycle resembled the Henderson in general form, being a longitudinal four-cylinder motorcycle with chain drive, but Henderson had to be careful not to infringe any trademarks or patents that would have been owned by Excelsior at the time. Production began in 1920. Death of William Henderson 1922 Ace motorcycle On December 11, 1922, shortly after 11 a.m., William Henderson was hit by a motor vehicle while testing the new Ace Sporting Solo in Philadelphia. He died at the age of 39 in Frankford Hospital without regaining consciousness. Arthur O. Lemon, former Henderson salesman and head of Excelsior and Henderson engineering at Excelsior Motor Manufacturing & Supply, left Excelsior in 1923 to replace Henderson as Chief Engineer at Ace. Ace Speed Trophy ACE Motorcycle In 1923, Red Wolverton rode a specially prepared Ace XP-4 at a record speed of . The management of Ace Motor Corporation offered the Ace Speed Trophy and a cash prize to anyone who could break the XP-4's record. Neither the trophy nor the prize was ever claimed. Ownership Ace Motor Corporation ceased operation in 1924. In the next two years, ownership of Ace's name, rights, and production facilities would change hands at least twice. At least one of these owners, Michigan Motors Corporation, would revive production for a short time. Indian Ace Indian Fours would feature Indian-style trailing-link forks with leaf springs. The property of Ace Motor changed hands for the last time in 1927, when it was purchased by the Indian Company. Production was moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, and the motorcycle was marketed as the Indian Ace for one year. Once the designs began to be modified within Indian, the Ace name was discontinued. Production of four-cylinder Indian motorcycles would continue until 1942.

United were formed in 1889 as an offshoot of the already existing Sheffield United Cricket Club and committee member and club secretary JB Wostinholm was placed in charge of team affairs, thus becoming their first 'manager' (although his official title was 'Club secretary'.) The Blades have since had a further twenty eight full-time managers (discounting those appointed on an interim basis). The club's most successful manager was John Nicholson who replaced Wostinholm in 1899 and who remained in the post until his death in 1932. Under Nicholson the Blades won the FA Cup four times and established themselves as one of the dominant forces in English football, although winning the Championship for a second time eluded them during that period. Since Nicholson's death the club have appointed a succession of managers who have enjoyed varying levels of success while the team has generally remained in the top two divisions of English football. The exception was a period of gradual decline during the late 1970s which ultimately saw United relegated to the fourth tier under Martin Peters in 1981. The club recovered and returned to the top-flight in 1990 under Dave Bassett. A period of relative stability came in 1999 under self confessed Blades fan Neil Warnock. He guided the team to two domestic cup semi-finals and a First Division play-off final in the 2002‚Äì03 season. Then in the 2005‚Äì06 season he guided the team back to the top-flight. They spent just one season in the Premier League and Warnock left the club following the club's relegation. A chaotic 2010‚Äì11 season saw the Blades go through three managers, Kevin Blackwell, who was assistant manager at United under former manager Neil Warnock. Gary Speed and another self confessed Blades fan and Sheffield born Micky Adams as well as John Carver who took charge as acting manager for a number of games, the ultimate result of which saw the side relegated to League One. The club remained in the third tier for five years under several managers; Former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Wilson, Nigel Clough and Nigel Adkins. Then in 2016 the club turned to Chris Wilder who was a former ball boy and former player as well as a Sheffield United fan. In his first season in charge he took the club back to the second tier finishing 1st with 100 points, a club record for highest points in a season. In his second season he got United off to a great start. Having beaten city rivals Sheffield Wednesday with 4‚Äì2 at Hillsborough (the most goals the club have ever scored in a game at Hillsborough). The team were top of the league and looking for back to back promotions. However the team would finish the season in 10th place, in part due to injuries to key players. The majority of the club's managers have been English, the only exceptions being John Harris, Ian Porterfield, Billy McEwan and David Weir (all from Scotland), Gary Speed (who was Welsh) and Danny Wilson who has represented Northern Ireland at international football. Wilson is also one of two managers to have been manager of United and fierce Steel City rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Wilson was Wednesday's manager in 1998 and also a player for Wednesday in the early 1990s. He was United's manager in 2011. The other manager is Steve Bruce, who started his managerial career at Sheffield United as a player-manager in 1998. Then became Wednesday's manager in 2019. Blades supporter, former ball boy and former player, Chris Wilder is the current manager. Managerial history =1889‚Äì1932: Early days= At its formation in 1889 United did not employ what would today be termed a manager, the side was coached by a trainer and a football committee selected the team and decided upon tactics (this was a continuation of the structure of Sheffield United Cricket Club from which the football team had been formed.) They did appoint Joseph Wostinholm to the position of club secretary and he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, matchday organisation and dealing with players and contracts. Wostinholm oversaw a period of rapid growth for the team, culminating in 1898 when United won their one and only First Division championship, after which he retired. Wostinholm was replaced by John Nicholson as secretary and he would remain in post for over 30 years until his death in 1932. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in the club's history as United became a leading force in English football, winning the FA Cup four times and regularly challenged at the top of the league but a second Division One title for the club eluded him. =1932‚Äì73: A new era= Following the death of John Nicholson, who died whilst travelling to an away match in Birmingham, the United board turned to Chesterfield manager Teddy Davison to become the club's first real manager. The team were in decline however and were soon relegated for the first time in their history. Davison gradually rebuilt the side with astute signings and young players and regained top-flight status but the club's post-war financial problems would hamper team building for years to come. Davison retired in 1952 and prompted the club to appoint Rotherham United manager Reg Freeman as his successor. Freeman stabilised the team but fell ill and died in 1955, after which United turned to the inexperienced Joe Mercer but he struggled to cope with a team in decline and departed for Aston Villa in 1958. United then appointed Chester manager John Harris who inherited a talented but under performing side which he transformed into a promotion team, returning to Division One in 1961. Harris built a side based on local players and stabilised them in the top-flight but financial issues soon prompted the sale of key players and United were eventually relegated once more. Harris opted to 'move upstairs' to become 'General Manager', and handed the role of team manager to Arthur Rowley but he was sacked after one season following disappointing results. Harris returned as manager and guided the side to promotion once more but after a good start back in the top-flight Harris' confidence faded and he stepped down in 1973 to 'move upstairs' for the second time. =1973‚Äì81: Rapid decline= Experienced Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy was the man United turned to replace John Harris. He initially did well but the team was ageing and there was little money to replace players, but after a good finish in his first season a disastrous string of results the following year led to Furphy being sacked in October 1975. Jimmy Sirrel was recruited from Notts County but he proved unpopular with both the players and fans and could not halt the decline, overseeing relegation and then being sacked in September 1977 with United at the bottom of Division Two. The ambitious and colourful Harry Haslam was then handed the reins and although many of his ideas were ahead of their time he built an ageing side based on 'star' players at the end of their career. Now in the Third Division performances deteriorated still further and Haslam stepped down due to illness in January 1981. World Cup winner and then United player Martin Peters was promoted to the position of manager but United were relegated to Division Four at the end of the season and Peters resigned. =1981‚Äì95: Moving on up= With a new ambitious board in place United recruited Ian Porterfield as manager in June 1981. He had an immediate impact, winning the Division Four championship in his first season and taking the club back into the second tier two years later on a meagre budget. Despite this many fans were unhappy with the style of football and Porterfield was sacked in 1986 following supporter protests. Coach Billy McEwan was promoted to the position of manager but failed to improve the standard of play and with attendances falling and the team in danger of relegation once more he was sacked in January 1988. United now turned to the colourful character of Dave Bassett who had most recently had a short, unsuccessful spell as manager of Watford. It was to prove an astute appointment as although he could not prevent relegation in his first season he built a solid, hard working team on a small budget and won back to back promotions, returning the club to the top-flight and achieving regular mid-table finishes. With the formation of the Premier League United's old financial problems and willingness to sell star players without replacing them meant the side eventually succumbed to relegation and when an immediate return was not forthcoming Basset was sacked in December 1995. =1995‚Äìpresent: Comings and goings= The following years proved a turbulent time for United as they chased the ambition of Premiership football. Experienced Howard Kendall was recruited as manager and undertook a complete rebuilding of the side but left in June 1997 to take over at Everton. Player-coach Nigel Spackman was promoted to replace Kendall but after initial promise he quit after only eight months citing boardroom interference. This was to become a recurring theme and replacement Steve Bruce would leave after only one season citing the same reasons. Adrian Heath then proved a disastrous appointment and lasted only six months before being sacked with United looking more likely to be relegated than promoted. The Blades then turned to experienced lower league manager Neil Warnock who managed to stave off relegation and began to rebuild the side on a meagre budget. Warnock proved a divisive figure with fans but after a number of mid-table finishes he achieved promotion back to the Premiership in 2006 but the side were poor the following season and were relegated, prompting the board not to renew Warnock's contract. Just like Adrian Heath, the appointment of Bryan Robson in 2007 proved an unpopular and unsuccessful one and he was sacked after less than a year following poor results and intense fan pressure. Former assistant manager Kevin Blackwell was appointed as Robson's replacement, but despite reaching the play-off finals in his first full season the team was obviously in decline and he was sacked after only two games of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Worse was to come however as player-coach Gary Speed was briefly promoted to manager, but left after only a few months to take over the Welsh national side. Micky Adams then became the third full-time manager of the season and oversaw a disastrous run of results which saw United relegated and Adams sacked after only six months in charge. With United in the third tier once more Danny Wilson was appointed as manager in June 2011, despite protests from United fans over his previous association with cross-town rivals Sheffield Wednesday. He guided the club to the League One play-off final in his first full season in charge, losing to Huddersfield Town. Despite the club challenging for promotion the following season, a poor run of results led to Wilson's departure in April 2013, being replaced by Chris Morgan until the end of the season. After a long search for a new boss former Scotland defender David Weir was appointed as Wilson's long-term replacement. His tenure was short-lived however, as he was sacked the following October after winning only one game from thirteen in charge. After Chris Morgan had overseen the team for a brief time, Nigel Clough was appointed as Weir's permanent successor in October 2013.

They chose sides following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in AD 632. A dispute over succession to Islamic prophet Muhammad as a caliph of the Islamic community spread across various parts of the world, which led to the Battle of Jamal and Battle of Siffin. After the death of Prophet Muhammed, Muslims had a disagreement. Sunnis believed that Muhammed's successor should be Abu Bakr and Omar, and the Shias believed that his successor should be Ali. The dispute intensified greatly after the Battle of Karbala, in which Hussein ibn Ali and his household were killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph Yazid I, and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community, which is known today as Islamic schism to differ from Christian schism that happened later. The present demographic breakdown between the two denominations is difficult to assess and varies by source, but a good approximation is that 85% of the world's Muslims are Sunni and 15% are Shia Muslims, with most Shias belonging to the Twelver tradition and the rest divided between many other groups. See further citations in the article Islam by country. Sunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities: in Southeast Asia, China, South Asia, Africa, and a part of the Arab world. Shia make up the majority of the citizen population in Iraq, Bahrain, Iran, and Azerbaijan, as well as being a politically significant minority in Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Kuwait. Today, there are differences in religious practice, traditions, and customs, often related to jurisprudence. Although all Muslim groups consider the Quran to be divine, Sunni and Shia have different opinions on hadith. In recent years, Sunni‚ÄìShia relations have been increasingly marked by conflict, particularly the Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict. Sectarian violence persists to this day from Pakistan to Yemen and is a major element of friction throughout the Middle East and South Asia. Tensions between communities have intensified during power struggles, such as the Bahraini uprising, the Iraq War, the Syrian Civil War, the formation of the self-styled Islamic State of Iraq and Syria that has launched a genocide against Shias. Numbers Sunnis are a majority in most Muslim communities in China and Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, most of the Arab World, Turkey and among Muslims in the United States wherein there is a breakdown at roughly Sunnism (65%), Shi'ism (11%) and non-denominational Muslims (24%). This can also be confusing because the majority of Arab Muslims in the United States are Shia, while the majority of Arab Americans are Christians, the conflation of Arab and Muslim being quite common. Shias make up the majority of the Muslim population in Iran (around 95%), Azerbaijan (around 85%), Iraq (around 70%) and Bahrain (around 75% of the citizens, excluding expatriates). Shia communities are also found in Yemen where a large minority of the population are Shia (mostly of the Zaidi sect), according to the UNHCR. Sources put the numbers of Shias in Yemen at 45%.Country profile: Yemen. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (August 2008). About 15% of Turkey's population belong to the Alevi sect. The Shia constitute around 30% of Kuwait, 45% of the Muslim population in Lebanon, 15% of Saudi Arabia,http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/GulfReligionGeneral_lg.png 12% of Syria, and 5%-20% of Pakistan. Around 5%-20% of Afghanistan, less than 1% of the Muslims in Nigeria, and around 1% of population of Tajikistan are Shia. 750px Historical beliefs and leadership =Successors of Muhammad= =Mahdi= The Mahdi is the prophesied redeemer of Islam. While Shias and Sunnis differ on the nature of the Mahdi, many members of both groupsGlasse, Cyril, The New Encyclopedia of Islam, Altamira Press, 2001, p. 280 believe that the Mahdi will appear at the end of the world to bring about a perfect and just Islamic society. In Shia Islam \\"the Mahdi symbol has developed into a powerful and central religious idea.\\"Martin, Richard C., ed. (2004), \\"Mahdi\\", Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world, Thompson Gale, p. 421 Twelvers believe the Mahdi will be Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam returned from the Occultation, where he has been hidden by Allah since 874. In contrast, mainstream Sunnis believe the Mahdi will be named Muhammad, be a descendant of Muhammad, and will revive the faith, but will not necessarily be connected with the end of the world.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 68 =Hadith= The Shias accept some of the same hadiths used by Sunnis as part of the sunnah to argue their case. In addition, they consider the sayings of Ahl al-Bayt that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni- accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and Ali each. =Shiism and Sufism= Shiism and Sufism are said to share a number of hallmarks: Belief in an inner meaning to the Quran, special status for some mortals (saints for Sufi, Imams for Shias), as well as veneration of Ali and Muhammad's family.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, pp. 59‚Äì60 =Pillars of faith= The Five Pillars of Islam (Arabic: ÿ£ÿ±ŸÉÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ) is the term given to the five duties incumbent on every Muslim. These duties are Shahada (profession of faith), salat (prayers), ZakƒÅt (giving of alms), Sawm (fasting, specifically during Ramadan) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). These five practices are essential to Sunni and Shia Muslims. Shia theology has two concepts that define religion as a whole. There are Roots of Religion (Us≈´l al-Dƒ´n) and Branches of Religion (Furu al Din). =Practices= Many distinctions can be made between Sunnis and Shiaƒ´s through observation alone: Salat A Sunni Muslim (Left) beside a Shia Muslim (right) showing different ways of holding arms during 16 March 2018 Tehran Friday prayer, Iran. When prostrating during ritual prayer called Salah in Arabic. Shias place their forehead onto a piece of naturally occurring material, most often a clay tablet (mohr), soil (turbah) at times from Karbala, the place where Hussein ibn Ali was martyred, instead of directly onto prayer rug. Some Shia perform prayers back to back, sometimes worshipping two times consecutively (1+2+2 i.e. fajr on its own Dhuhr with Asr and Maghrib with Isha'), thus praying five times a day but with a very small break in between the prayer, instead of five prayers with some gap between them as required by Sunni schools of law. Shias and the followers of the Sunni Maliki school hold their hands at their sides during prayer; Sunnis of other schools cross their arms (right over left) and clasp their hands;Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 43 it is commonly held by Sunni scholars especially of Maliki school that either is acceptable. Mut'ah and Misyar Twelver Shia as the main branch of Shia Islam permit Nikah mut‚ÄòahAllah Calls Mut‚Äôah ‚ÄúA Good Thing‚Äù Retrieved 10 December 2017Mutah (Temporary Marriage) Retrieved 10 December 2017‚Äîfixed-term temporary marriage‚Äîwhich is not acceptable within the Sunni community, the Ismaili Shia or the Zaidi Shia and is believed a planned and agreed fornication. Twelvers believe that Mutah was permitted until Umar forbade it during his rule. Mutah is not the same as Misyar marriage or 'Arfi marriage, which has no date of expiration and is permitted by some Sunnis. A Misyar marriage differs from a conventional Islamic marriage in that the man does not have financial responsibility of the woman by her own free will. The man can divorce the woman whenever he wants to in a Misyar marriage. Hijab and dress Both Sunni and Shia women wear the hijab. Devout women of the Shia traditionally wear black and yellow as do some Sunni women in the Persian Gulf. Some Shia religious leaders also wear a black robe. Mainstream Shia and Sunni women wear the hijab differently. Some Sunni scholars emphasize covering of all body including the face in public whereas some scholars exclude the face from hijab. Shias believe that the hijab must cover around the perimeter of the face and up to the chin. Like Sunnis, some Shia women, such as those in Iran and Iraq, use their hand to hold the black chador, in order to cover their faces when in public. Given names Shia are sometimes recognizable by their names, which are often derived from the names of Ahl al- Bayt. In particular, the names Fatima, Zaynab, Ali, Abbas, Hussein, and Hassan are disproportionately common among Shias, though they may also be used by Sunnis. Umar, Uthman, Abu Bakr, Aisha, Muawiya, being the names of figures recognized by Sunnis but not Shias, are commonly used as names for Sunnis but are very rare, if not virtually absent, for Shias. Early history =Abbasid era= Destruction of the Tomb of Husayn ibn Ali at Karbala, condemned in a Mughal era manuscript. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by a new dynasty, the Abbasids. The first Abbasid caliph, As-Saffah, recruited Shia support in his campaign against the Umayyads by emphasising his blood relationship to Muhammad's household through descent from his uncle, ‚ÄòAbbas ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib.The March of Islam: Time Frame, AD 600‚Äì800, p. 48. Pub. Robert H. Smith. Alexandria: Time Life, 1988. The Shia also believe that he promised them that the Caliphate, or at least religious authority, would be vested in the Shia Imam. As-Saffah assumed both the temporal and religious mantle of Caliph himself. He continued the Umayyad dynastic practice of succession, and his brother al-Mansur succeeded him in 754. Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Shia Imam, died during al-Mansur's reign, and there were claims that he was murdered on the orders of the caliph.Ya'qubi; vol. III, pp. 91‚Äì96, and Tarikh Abul Fida, vol. I, p. 212. (However, Abbasid persecution of Islamic lawyers was not restricted to the Shia. Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa, for example, was imprisoned by al-Mansur and tortured.) Shia sources further claim that by the orders of the tenth Abassid caliph, al-Mutawakkil, the tomb of the third Imam, Hussein ibn Ali in Karbala, was completely demolished,Bihar al-Anwar, vol. XII, on the life of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and Shias were sometimes beheaded in groups, buried alive, or even placed alive within the walls of government buildings still under construction.Shi'a Islam, p. 62 The Shia believe that their community continued to live for the most part in hiding and followed their religious life secretly without external manifestations.Ya'qubi. vol. II, p. 224; Abu'l-Fida', vol. I, p. 192; Al-Masudi, vol. III, p. 81', also Shi'a Islam, p. 60. =Iraq= Many Shia Iranians migrated to what is now Iraq in the 16th century. \\"It is said that when modern Iraq was formed, some of the population of Karbala was Iranian\\". In time, these immigrants adopted the Arabic language and Arab identity, but their origin has been used to \\"unfairly cast them as lackeys of Iran\\".Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 108 However many of these Shias come from Sayyid families with origins in tribes from Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain, one of said tribes being al-Musawi, and two prevalent families that are descended from it and lived in Iran for some time before settling in Iraq are the al-Qazwini and al-Shahristani families. Other Iraqi Shias are ethnic Arabs with roots in Iraq as deep as those of their Sunni counterparts.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 110 =Persia= Shafi'i Sunnism was the dominant form of Islam in most of Iran until rise of the Safavid Empire although a significant undercurrent of Ismailism and a very large minority of Twelvers were present all over Persia. The Sunni hegemony did not undercut the Shia presence in Iran. The writers of the Shia Four Books were Iranian, as were many other scholars. According to Morteza Motahhari: Yavuz Sultan Selim who delivered a devastating blow to the Shia Safavids and Ismail I in the Battle of Chaldiran, a battle of historical significance. Pre-Safavid The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaidis of Tabaristan, the Buwayhid, the rule of the Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. 1304‚Äì1316) and the Sarbedaran. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufa, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Al Hillah. Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar. In many other areas the population of Shias and Sunni was mixed. The first Zaidi state was established in Daylaman and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 by the Alavids;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali al- Zaidi, At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites), 2005 Referencing: Iranian Influence on Moslem Literature it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Samanids in 928. Roughly forty years later the state was revived in Gilan (north-western Iran) and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126. After which from the 12th-13th centuries, the Zaidis of Daylaman, Gilan and Tabaristan then acknowledge the Zaidi Imams of Yemen or rival Zaidi Imams within Iran.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, At- tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites), 2005 Referencing: Encyclopedia Iranica The Buyids, who were Zaidi and had a significant influence not only in the provinces of Persia but also in the capital of the caliphate in Baghdad, and even upon the caliph himself, provided a unique opportunity for the spread and diffusion of Shia thought. This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate. Twelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the Asharis tribe at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, who were from Rey and Sabzawar and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of Al-Hilli and his son Fakhr al- Muhaqqiqin. Fourth, through the scholars of Jabal Amel residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran. On the other hand, the Ismaili da‚Äòwah (\\"missionary institution\\") sent missionaries (du‚ÄòƒÅt, sg. dƒÅ‚Äòƒ´) during the Fatimid Caliphate to Persia. When the Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in northern Persia. Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured Alamut in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the Mongols finally seized and destroyed it in 1256. After the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni Ulama suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as Anatolia and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement. Several local Shia dynasties like the Marashi and Sarbadars were established during this time. The kings of the Kara Koyunlu dynasty ruled in Tabriz with a domain extending to Fars and Kerman. In Egypt the Fatimid government ruled.al-Ka-mil of Ibn Athir, Cairo, 1348; Raudat al- safa' ; and Habib as-Siyar of Khwand Mir Muhammad Khudabandah, the famous builder of Soltaniyeh, was among the first of the Mongols to convert to Shiaism, and his descendants ruled for many years in Persia and were instrumental in spreading Shƒ´‚Äòƒ´ thought.Abu'l-Fida' , vol. II, p. 63 and vol. III, p. 50 Sufism played a major role in spread of Shiism in this time. Post-Safavid Ismail I initiated a religious policy to recognize Shiism as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran and Azerbaijan remain majority-Shia states is a direct result of Ismail's actions. Shah Ismail I of Safavid dynasty destroyed the tombs of Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa and the Sufi Abdul Qadir Gilani in 1508. In 1533, Ottomans restored order, reconquered Iraq and rebuilt Sunni shrines. Unfortunately for Ismail, most of his subjects were Sunni. He thus had to enforce official Shiism violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert, but it is safe to say that the majority of the population was probably genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority. This led to a wide gap between Iran and its Sunni neighbors, particularly its rival, the Ottoman Empire, in the wake of the Battle of Chaldiran. This gap continued until the 20th century.

The Shia faith in the Levant started spreading during the Hamdanid rule, which commenced in the start of the 10th century. It was followed by the Mirdasid Shi'ite emirate in the 11th century, with both the emirates centered at Aleppo. The general observations recorded by Muslim travellers passing through the Levant during the tenth and eleventh centuries, notably al-Maqdisi in his geographical works, ‚ÄúThe best divisions in the knowledge of the regions‚Äù, as well as Ibn Jubayr, indicate that Shia Muslims made up the majority of the populations of the regions of the Levant during this era, notably in the cities of Damascus, Tiberias, Nablus, Tyre, Homs and Jabal Amel. In addition to the account of Nasir Khusraw who visited Jerusalem in the year 1045 AD and reported: \\"The population of Jerusalem is about 20,000, the populace being mostly Shi'a Muslims\\". However, with the advent of the Zengids and Ayyubids, the population of Shias dwindled greatly due to conversion and migrations. In 1305, the Sunni Mamelukes carried out a grand campaign to erase the Shiite dominance in the coastal mountains of Lebanon. This campaign forced most the Shiites to disperse, with some fleeing south to Jabal Amel and some to the Bekaa, while a very small portion of them took on the practice of Taqiyya until the Ottomans came in 1517. Many Shias in the Levant were killed for their faith. One of these was Muhammad Ibn Makki, called Shahid-i Awwal (the First Martyr), one of the great figures in Shia jurisprudence, who was killed in Damascus in 1384. Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi was another eminent scholar, killed in Aleppo on charges of cultivating Batini teachings and philosophy. On 21 April 1802, about 12,000 Wahhabi Sunnis under the command of Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad, the second ruler of the First Saudi State attacked and sacked Karbala, killed between 2,000 to 5,000 inhabitants and plundered the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of Prophet Muhammad and son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, and destroyed its dome, seizing a large quantity of spoils, including gold, Persian carpets, money, pearls, and guns that had accumulated in the tomb, most of them donations. The attack lasted for eight hours, after which the Wahhabis left the city with more than 4,000 camels carrying their plunder. =Caucasus region= The Sack of Shamakhi took place on 18 August 1721, when 15,000 Sunni Lezgins, of the Safavid Empire, attacked the capital of Shirvan province, Shamakhi (in present-day Azerbaijan Republic), massacred between 4,000 to 5,000 of it's Shia population and ransacked the city. =India= Sunni razzias which came to be known as Taarajs virtually devastated the community. History records 10 such Taarajs also known as Taraj-e-Shia between the 15th and 19th centuries in 1548, 1585, 1635, 1686, 1719, 1741, 1762, 1801, 1830, 1872 during which the Shia habitations were plundered, people slaughtered, libraries burnt and their sacred sites desecrated. Mughal Empire Shia in India faced persecution by some Sunni rulers and Mughal Emperors which resulted in the killings of Shia scholars like Qazi Nurullah ShustariAn introduction to Shi'i Islam: the history and doctrines of Twelver Shi'ism By Moojan Momen, #121. (also known as Shaheed-e-Thaalis, the third Martyr) and Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi (also known as Shaheed-e- Rabay, the fourth Martyr) who are two of the five martyrs of Shia Islam. Shias in Kashmir in subsequent years had to pass through the most atrocious period of their history. 20th century Sunni‚ÄìShia clashes also occurred occasionally in the 20th century in India. There were many between 1904 and 1908. These clashes revolved around the public cursing of the first three caliphs by Shias and the praising of them by Sunnis. To put a stop to the violence, public demonstrations were banned in 1909 on the three most sensitive days: Ashura, Chehlum and Ali's death on 21 Ramadan. Intercommunal violence resurfaced in 1935‚Äì36 and again in 1939 when many thousands of Sunni and Shias defied the ban on public demonstrations and took to the streets.Momen, Moojan, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p. 276 Shia are estimated to be 21‚Äì35% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the two groups and practice of taqiyya by Shia.Momen, Moojan, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p. 277 Modern history In addition to Iran, Iraq has emerged as a major Shia government when the Twelvers achieved political dominance in 2005 under American occupation. The two communities have often remained separate, mingling regularly only during the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca. In some countries like Iraq, Syria, Kuwait and Bahrain, communities have mingled and intermarried. Some Shia have complained of mistreatment in countries dominated by Sunnis, especially in Saudi Arabia,Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage, Simon and Schuster, (2001), pp. 149‚Äì58 while some Sunnis have complained of discrimination in the Twelver-dominated states of Iraq and Iran.Information on sectarian violence against Sunni Muslims UNHCR Some tension developed between Sunnis and Shia as a result of clashes over Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police at the hajj. Millions of Saudi adhere to the school of Salafism which is a branch of Sunni Islam. According to some reports, as of mid-2013, the Syrian Civil War has become \\"overtly sectarian\\" with the \\"sectarian lines fall most sharply\\" between Alawites and Sunnis.Syrian fight now 'overtly sectarian,' U.N. says By Joe Sterling, Saad Abedine and Salma Abdelaziz, CNN 20 December 2012 With the involvement of Lebanese Shia paramilitary group Hezbollah, the fighting in Syria has reignited \\"long-simmering tensions between Sunnis and Shi‚Äôites\\" spilling over into Lebanon and Iraq.As Syria fights, sectarian wave rises in region By Tim Arango and Anne Barnard New York Times 2 June 2013 Ex-Ambassador Dimitar Mihaylov further claims that the current post-Arab Spring situation (encompassing ISIS, the Syrian civil war, Yemen, Iraq and others) represents a \\"qualitatively new\\" development in the history of Shi'a-Sunni dynamics. Historically, the inner rifts within Islamic ideology were to be hidden from the public sphere, while the new violent outbreaks highlight said rift in an obvious manner and is nourished by the two extremes of their mutual rivalry which will strongly affect both globally and regionally. =1919‚Äì1970= At least one scholar sees the period from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire through the decline of Arab nationalism as a time of relative unity and harmony between traditionalist Sunni and Shia Muslims‚Äîunity brought on by a feeling of being under siege from a common threat, secularism, first of the European colonial variety and then Arab nationalist.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 106 An example of Sunni‚ÄìShia cooperation was the Khilafat Movement which swept South Asia following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the seat of the Caliphate, in World War I. Shia scholars \\"came to the caliphate's defence\\" by attending the 1931 Caliphate Conference in Jerusalem, although they were theologically opposed to the idea that non-imams could be caliphs or successors to Muhammad, and that the caliphate was \\"the flagship institution\\" of Sunni, not Shia, authority. This has been described as unity of traditionalists in the face of the twin threats of \\"secularism and colonialism.\\" In these years Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi travelled to Cairo and started his efforts for reforming Islamic unity at Al-Azhar University, since 1938. Finally, his efforts and contacting with scholars such as Mahmud Shaltut and Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi led to the founding of Dar-al-Taghrib (community for reforming unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims). Another example of unity was a fatwƒÅ issued by the rector of Al-Azhar University, Mahmud Shaltut, recognizing Shia Islamic law as the fifth school of Islamic law. In 1959, al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most influential center of Sunni learning, authorized the teaching of courses of Shia jurisprudence as part of its curriculum.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p. 107 The year of the Iranian Islamic Revolution was \\"one of great ecumenical discourse\\", and shared enthusiasm by both Shia and Sunni Islamists. After the Iranian Revolution and the fall of Pahlavi dynasty, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini endeavored to bridge the gap between Shiites and Sunnis by declaring it permissible for Twelvers to pray behind Sunni imams and by forbidding criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali‚Äîan issue that had caused much animosity between the two groups.Frequently Asked Questions on Iran In addition, he designated the period of Prophet's Birthday celebrations from 12th to the 17th of Rabi Al-Awwal as the Islamic Unity Week, there being a gap in the dates of when Shiites and Sunnis celebrate Muhammad's birthday. =Post-1980= Damage to a mosque in Khorramshahr, Iran Following this period, Sunni‚ÄìShia strife has seen a major upturn, particularly in Iraq and Pakistan, leading to thousands of deaths. Among the explanations for the increase are conspiracies by outside forces to divide Muslims, the recent Islamic revival and increased religious purity and consequent takfir, upheaval, destruction and loss of power of Sunni caused by the US invasion of Iraq, and sectarianism generated by Arab regimes defending themselves against the mass uprisings of the Arab Spring. ;Outside conspiracies Many in the Muslim world explain the bloodshed as the work of conspiracies by outside forces‚Äî\\"the forces of hegemony and Zionism which aim to weaken [Arabs]\\" (Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Yusuf al-Qaradawi), unspecified \\"enemies\\" (Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad),\\"Saudi king meets with Iranian president\\". International Herald Tribune by Hassan M. Fattah, 4 March 2007 or \\"oppressive pressure by the imperialist front.\\" (Mahmoud Ahmadinejad). Some Western analysts assert that the US is practicing divide and rule strategy through the escalation of Sunni-Shia conflict. Nafeez Ahmed cites a 2008 RAND Corporation study for the American military which recommended \\"divide and rule\\" as a possible strategy against the Muslim world in \\"the Long War.\\" Dr. Christopher Davidson argues that the current crisis in Yemen is being ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by the US, and could be part of a wider covert strategy to ‚Äúspur fragmentation in Iran allies and allow Israel to be surrounded by weak states‚Äù. ;Islamic revival Others lay the blame for the strife at a very different source, the unintended effects of the Islamic revival. According to scholar Vali Nasr, as the Muslim world was decolonialised and Arab nationalism lost its appeal, fundamentalism blossomed and reasserted the differences and conflicts between the two movements, particularly in the strict teachings of Sunni scholar Ibn Taymiyyah.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, pp. 106‚Äì07 The Iranian Islamic revolution changed the Shia‚ÄìSunni power equation in Muslim countries \\"from Lebanon to India\\" arousing the traditionally subservient Shia to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 148‚Äì50 \\"Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance.\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 143‚Äì44 Although the Iranian revolution's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was very much in favor of Shia‚ÄìSunni unity, he also challenged Saudi Arabia, in his view an \\"unpopular and corrupt dictatorship\\" and an \\"American lackey\\" ripe for revolution. In part because Saudi Arabia was the world's major international funder of Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, this angered not only Saudi Arabia but its many fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world, according to Nasr.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 143‚Äì44, 147‚Äì48, 150‚Äì51 Another effect noted by political scientist Gilles Kepel, is that the initial attraction of the Islamic Revolution to Sunnis as well as Shia, and Khomeini's desire to export his revolution, motivated the Saudi establishment to shore up its \\"religious legitimacy\\" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with Iran's revolutionary ideology.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: p. 137 But doing so in Saudi meant a more anti-Shia policies because Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam is Wahhabism, which includes the prohibition of Shia Islam itself, as strict Wahhabis do not consider Shia to be Islamic. This new strictness was spread not only among Saudis in the kingdom but thousands of students and Saudi funded schools and international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad in Afghanistan and went home in the 1990s to fight jihad. Both groups (especially in Iraq and Pakistan) saw Shia as the enemy.Kepel, Jihad, 2002: pp. 142‚Äì43 Thus, although the Iranian revolution's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, was very much in favor of Shia‚ÄìSunni unity, and \\"the leadership position that went with it\\",Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 138 his revolution worked against it. From the Iranian Revolution to 2015, Shia groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, supported by Iran have recently won \\"important political victories\\" which have boosted Iran's regional influence. In Lebanon, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political movement is the \\"strongest political actor\\" in the country. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq removed Saddam Hussein from power and instituted elected government, the Shia majority has dominated the parliament and its prime ministers have been Shia. In Syria, a Shia minority‚Äîthe heterodox Alawi sect that makes up only about 13 percent of the population‚Äîdominate the upper reaches of the government, military and security services in Syria, and are the \\"backbone\\" of the forces fighting to protect the Bashir al-Assad regime in Syria's civil war. In Yemen, Houthi rebels have expanded their territory south of Saudi Arabia, and become the country's \\"dominant power\\". Olivier Roy, research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, sees the \\"Shia awakening and its instrumentalisation by Iran\\" as leading to a \\"very violent Sunni reaction\\", starting first in Pakistan before spreading to \\"the rest of the Muslim world, without necessarily being as violent.\\" According to Roy, \\"two events created a sea change in the balance of power between Shia and Sunnis: the Islamic revolution in Iran and the American military intervention in Iraq\\" in 2003. \\"Today, Azerbaijan is probably the only country where there are still mixed mosques and Shia and Sunnis pray together.\\"Roy, Olivier, The Politics of Chaos in the Middle East, Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 105 From 1994 to 2014 satellite television and high-speed Internet has spread \\"hate speech\\" against both Sunni and Shia. Fundamentalist Sunni clerics have popularized slurs against Shia such as \\"Safawis\\" (from the Safavid empire, thus implying their being an Iranian agents), or even worse rafidha (rejecters of the faith), and majus (Zoroastrian or crypto Persian). In turn, Shia religious scholars have \\"mocked and cursed\\" the first three caliphs and Aisha, Mohammed's youngest wife who fought against Ali. ;US invasion of Iraq Among those blaming the US invasion of Iraq are Fawaz Gerges, who writes in his book ISIS: A History, > By destroying state institutions and establishing a sectarian-based > political system, the 2003 US-led invasion polarized the country along > Sunni-Shia lines and set the stage for a fierce, prolonged struggle driven > by identity politics. Anger against the United States was also fueled by the > humiliating disbandment of the Iraqi army and the de-Baathification law, > which was first introduced as a provision and then turned into a permanent > article of the constitution. Malise Ruthven writes that the post invasion de-Ba'athification by the US occupiers deprived Iraq of \\"the officer class and administrative cadres that had ruled under Saddam Hussein, leaving the field to sectarian-based militias\\". Many of officers joined the anti-Shia takfiri ISIL group. The US- led invasion also ‚Äútilted the regional balance of power decisively\\" in favor of Shia Iran, alarming Sunni and leading to talk of a ‚ÄúShia Crescent‚Äù. ;Counter-revolutionary tactic Marc Lynch in his book The New Arab Wars: Uprisings and Anarchy in the Middle East, argues that as old regimes or political forces sought to control \\"the revolutionary upsurge\\" of the Arab Spring, sectarianism became ‚Äúa key weapon‚Äù to undermine unity among the anti- regime masses. Christians were pitted \\"against Muslims in Egypt, Jordanians against Palestinians in Jordan, and, above all, Sunnis against Shi‚Äôites wherever possible.‚Äù  Iraq  Shia‚ÄìSunni discord in Iraq starts with disagreement over the relative population of the two groups. According to most sources, including the CIA's World Factbook, the majority of Iraqis are Shia Arab Muslims (60%-70%), and Sunni Arab Muslims represent between 32% and 37% of the population. However, Sunni are split ethnically among Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. Many Sunnis hotly dispute their minority status, including ex-Iraqi Ambassador Faruq Ziada, and many believe Shia majority is \\"a myth spread by America\\".Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 200 One Sunni belief shared by Jordan's King Abdullah as well as his then Defense Minister Shaalan is that Shia numbers in Iraq were inflated by Iranian Shias crossing the border.Robin Wright and Peter Baker, \\"Iraq: Jordan Sees Threat to the Election from Iran\\", Washington Post, 8 December 2004 Shia scholar Vali Nasr believes the election turnout in summer and December 2005 confirmed a strong Shia majority in Iraq.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 201 The British, having put down a Shia rebellion against their rule in the 1920s, \\"confirmed their reliance on a corps of Sunni ex-officers of the collapsed Ottoman empire\\". The British colonial rule ended after the Sunni and Shia united against it.The Arab Shia, p. 46 The Shia suffered indirect and direct persecution under post-colonial Iraqi governments since 1932, erupting into full-scale rebellions in 1935 and 1936. Shias were also persecuted during the Ba'ath Party rule, especially under Saddam Hussein. It is said that every Shia clerical family of note in Iraq had tales of torture and murder to recount.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, (Norton, 2006), p. 187 In 1969 the son of Iraq's highest Shia Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim was arrested and allegedly tortured. From 1979‚Äì1983 Saddam's regime executed 48 major Shia clerics in Iraq.according to pro-Khomeini author Abdel-Majid Trab Zemzem, in his book The Iraq-Iran War, Islam and Nationalisms, translated from the French by Zinab Mohammad, United States Publishing Company, 1986, pp. 42‚Äì43 They included Shia leader Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and his sister. Tens of thousands of Iranians and Arabs of Iranian origin were expelled in 1979 and 1980 and a further 75,000 in 1989.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 110 The Shias openly revolted against Saddam following the Gulf War in 1991 and were encouraged by Saddam's defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia opposition to the government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression by Saddam's forces. The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis for nearly a century until the 2003 Iraq War. * Iraq War Some of the worst sectarian strife ever has occurred after the start of the Iraq War, steadily building up to the present. The war has featured a cycle of Sunni‚ÄìShia revenge killing‚ÄîSunni often used car bombs, while Shia favored death squads. According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.March 14, 2008 The Independent/UK \\"The Cult of the Suicide Bomber\\" by Robert Fisk \\"month-long investigation by The Independent, culling four Arabic-language newspapers, official Iraqi statistics, two Beirut news agencies and Western reports\\" Sunni suicide bombers have targeted not only thousands of civilians,over half of the 20,000 fatalities worldwide from terrorism in 2006 occurred in Iraq according to the American National Counter-terrorism Center Report on Terrorist Incidents 2006 p. 3 but mosques, shrines, wedding and funeral processions, markets, hospitals, offices, and streets.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, (Norton, 2006), p. 203 Sunni insurgent organizations include Ansar al-Islam. Radical groups include Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad, Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah, Jeish Muhammad, and Black Banner Organization. Takfir motivation for many of these killings may come from Sunni insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Before his death Zarqawi was one to quote Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, especially his infamous statement urging followers to kill the Shia of Iraq,Al Jazeera 17 September 2005, \\"Al-Zarqawi declares war on Iraqi Shia ,\\" Accessed 20 February 2008 and calling the Shias \\"snakes\\".\\"Zarqawi rails against Shia 'snakes'\\" The Daily Telegraph, 3 June 2006, Accessed 7 February 2007. An al-Qaeda-affiliated website posted a call for \\"a full-scale war on Shiites all over Iraq, whenever and wherever they are found.\\"New York Times, 19 September 2005, Sabrina Tavernise and Robert F. Worth, \\"Relentless Rebel Attacks Test Shiite Endurance\\", Suicide bombers continue to attack Iraqi Shia civilians,CBC News: \\"Sectarian violence kills 36 during climax of Shia holy festival\\". Jan 2007. and the Shia ulama have in response declared suicide bombing as haraam (against God, or \\"forbidden\\"): Some believe the war has strengthened the takfir thinking and may spread Sunni‚ÄìShia strife elsewhere. On the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly \\"tortur[ing] to death or summarily\\" executing \\"hundreds\\" of Sunnis \\"every month in Baghdad alone,\\" many arrested at random.\\"Iraq militias' wave of death, Sectarian killings now surpass terrorist bombings,\\" The Boston Globe, 2 April 2006 According to the British television Channel 4, from 2005 through early 2006, commandos of the Ministry of the Interior which is controlled by the Badr Organization, and The violence shows little sign of getting opposite sides to back down. Iran's Shia leaders are said to become \\"more determined\\" the more violent the anti-Shia attacks in Iraq become.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival (Norton 2006), p. 223 One Shia Grand Ayatollah, Yousef Saanei, who has been described as a moderate, reacted to the 2005 suicide bombings of Shia targets in Iraq by saying the bombers were \\"wolves without pity\\" and that \\"sooner rather than later, Iran will have to put them down\\".Robert Baer, \\"The Devil You Think You Know,\\" Newsweek International, 15 August 2005. Originally on MSNBC, now on Mangan's \\"The Devil You Think You Know\\"  Iran  Iran is unique in the Muslim world because its population is overwhelmingly more Shia than Sunni (Shia constitute 95% of the population) and because its constitution is theocratic republic based on rule by a Shia jurist. Although the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, supported good Sunni‚ÄìShia relations, there have been complaints by Sunni of discrimination, particularly in important government positions.Interview with Molavi Ali Akbar Mollahzadeh The Iran Brief, In a joint appearance with former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani calling for Shia-Sunni unity, Sunni Shiekh Yusuf al-Qaradawi complained that no ministers in Iran have been Sunni for a long time, that Sunni officials are scarce even in the regions with majority of Sunni population (such as Kurdistan, or Balochistan)Al-Jazeera discussion between Qardawi and Rafsanjani Rafsanjani & Al-Qaradawi call upon nation to unite & reject fighting, 2007-02-15 and despite the presence of Christian churches, as a prominent example of this discrimination. Although reformist President Mohammad Khatami promised during his election campaign to build a Sunni mosque in Tehran, none was built during his eight years in office. The president explained the situation by saying Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would not agree to the proposal. As in other parts of the Muslim world, other issues may play a part in the conflict, since most Sunnis in Iran are also ethnic minorities. Soon after the 1979 revolution, Sunni leaders from Kurdistan, Balouchistan, and Khorassan, set up a new party known as Shams, which is short for Shora-ye Markaz-e al Sunaat, to unite Sunnis and lobby for their rights. But six months after that they were closed down, bank accounts suspended and had their leaders arrested by the government on charges that they were backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. A UN human rights report states that: Members of the 'Balochistan Peoples Front' claim that Sunnis are systematically discriminated against educationally by denial of places at universities, politically by not allowing Sunnis to be army generals, ambassadors, ministers, prime minister, or president, religiously insulting Sunnis in the media, economic discrimination by not giving import or export licenses for Sunni businesses while the majority of Sunnis are left unemployed.Shia equality or Shia supremacy? Balochistan People's Front Reza Hossein Borr, leadership consultant and author of \\"New Vision for the Islamic World\\" There has been a low level resistance in mainly Sunni Iranian Balouchistan against the regime for several years. Official media refers to the fighting as armed clashes between the police and \\"bandits,\\" \\"drug-smugglers,\\" and \\"thugs,\\" to disguise what many believe is essentially a political-religious conflict. Revolutionary Guards have stationed several brigades in Balouchi cities, and have allegedly tracked down and assassinated Sunni leaders both inside Iran and in neighboring Pakistan. In 1996 a leading Sunni, Abdulmalek Mollahzadeh, was gunned down by hitmen, allegedly hired by Tehran, as he was leaving his house in Karachi.Interview with Molavi Ali Akbar Mollahzadeh The Iran Brief, Issue Number 35, 2 June 1997 Members of Sunni groups in Iran however have been active in what the authorities describe as terrorist activities. Balochi Sunni Abdolmalek Rigi continue to declare the Shia as Kafir and Mushrik.Source quoting the newspaper Entekhab: varedi-st.persianblog.ir These Sunni groups have been involved in violent activities in Iran and have waged terrorist attacks against civilian centers, including an attack next to a girls' school according to government sources. The \\"shadowy Sunni militant group Jundallah\\" has reportedly been receiving weaponry from the United States for these attacks according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. The United Nations and several countries worldwide have condemned the bombings. (See 2007 Zahedan bombings for more information) Non-Sunni Iranian opposition parties, and Shia like Ayatollah Jalal Gange‚Äôi have criticised the regime's treatment of Sunnis and confirmed many Sunni complaints.NCRI Statement, \\"Ahmadinejad sheds crocodile tears for Sunnis in Iran \\" Following the 2005 elections, much of the leadership of Iran has been described as more \\"staunchly committed to core Shia values\\" and lacking Ayatollah Khomeini's commitment to Shia‚ÄìSunni unity.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 225 Polemics critical of Sunnis were reportedly being produced in Arabic for dissemination in the Arab Muslim world by Hojjatieh-aligned elements in the Iranian regime.\\"Shia Supremacists Emerge from Iran's Shadows\\" Asia Times, August 27, 2005 Iranian government denies any allegations of discrimination against its Sunni citizens citing facts that there are Sunni mayors, police officers, judges, lawyers, clerics. Sunnis in Iran run multiple religious schools and own mosques that can accommodate thousands of worshipers at any given time. There are 10,000‚Äì15,000 Sunni mosques all over Iran, with 9 in Tehran alone. According to the Iranian law, Shias are not allowed to build mosques in Sunni majority areas and vice versa. Sunnis mosques are not allowed in the capital city of Tehran, and a number of Sunni mosques in other cities have been demolished, Sunni literature and teachings are banned in public schools and construction of new Sunni mosques and schools are banned.  Syria  Syria is approximately three quarters Sunni, but its government is predominantly Alawite, a Shia sect that makes up less than 15% of the population. Under Hafez al-Assad, Alawites dominated the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, a secular Arab nationalist party which had ruled Syria under a state of emergency from 1963 to 2011. Alawites are often considered a form of Shia Islam, that differs somewhat from the larger Twelver Shia sect. During the 20th century, an Islamic uprising in Syria occurred with sectarian religious overtones between the Alawite-dominated Assad government and the Islamist Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, culminating with the 1982 Hama massacre. An estimated 10,000 to 40,000 Syrians, mostly civilians, were killed by Syrian military in the city. During the uprising, the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood attacked military cadets at an artillery school in Aleppo, performed car bomb attacks in Damascus, as well as bomb attacks against the government and its officials, including Hafez al- Assad himself, and had killed several hundred. How much of the conflict was sparked by Sunni versus Shia divisions and how much by Islamism versus secular-Arab-nationalism, is in question, but according to scholar Vali Nasr the failure of the Ayatollah Khomeini and the Islamic Republic of Iran to support the Muslim Brotherhood against the Baathists \\"earned [Khomeini] the Brotherhood's lasting contempt.\\" It proved to the satisfaction of the Brotherhood that sectarian loyalty trumped Islamist solidarity for Khomeini and eliminated whatever appeal Khomeini might have had to the MB movement as a pan-Islamic leader.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 154 * Syria Civil War The Syrian Civil War, though it started as a political conflict, developed into a struggle between the Alawite-dominated Army and government on the one hand, and the mainly Sunni rebels and former members of the regular army on the other. The casualty toll of the war's first three years has exceeded that of Iraq's decade-long conflict, and the fight has \\"amplified sectarian tensions to unprecedented levels\\". Rebel groups with 10,000s of Sunni Syrian fighters such as Ahrar ash-Sham, the Islamic Front, and al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, employ anti-Shia rhetoric and foreign Arab and Western Sunni fighters have joined the rebels. On the other side Shia from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kata'ib Hezbollah militias from Iraq have backed the Syrian government. \\"Even Afghan Shia refugees in Iran\\", driven from Afghanistan by Sunni extremism, have \\"reportedly been recruited by Tehran for the war in Syria\\".  Saudi Arabia  While Shia make up roughly 15% of Saudi Arabia's population,Saudi Arabia's Shia press for rights retrieved 19 July 2012 they form a large portion of the residents of the eastern province of Hasa‚Äîby some estimates a majority\\"The country's minority Shia populations form a majority in the country's oil rich eastern province of Hasa\\" Neighbours eye Iraq elections By Sam Sasan Shoamanesh‚Äîwhere much of the petroleum industry is based. Between 500,000 and a million Shia live there,Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 236 concentrated especially around the oases of Qatif and al-Hasa. The Majority of Saudi Shia belong to the sect of the Twelvers.Library of Congress: Saudi Arabia The Saudi conflict of Shia and Sunni extends beyond the borders of the kingdom because of international Saudi \\"Petro-Islam\\" influence. Saudi Arabia backed Iraq in the 1980‚Äì1988 war with Iran and sponsored militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan who‚Äîthough primarily targeting the Soviet Union, which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979‚Äîalso fought to suppress Shia movements. Relations between the Shia and the Wahhabis are inherently strained because the Wahhabis consider the rituals of the Shia to be the epitome of shirk, or polytheism. In the late 1920s, the Ikhwan (Ibn Saud's fighting force of converted Wahhabi Bedouin Muslims) were particularly hostile to the Shia and demanded that Abd al Aziz forcibly convert them. In response, Abd al Aziz sent Wahhabi missionaries to the Eastern Province, but he did not carry through with attempts at forced conversion. In recent decades the late leading Saudi cleric, Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz, issued fatwa denouncing Shia as apostates, and according to Shia scholar Vali Nasr \\"Abdul-Rahman al-Jibrin, a member of the Higher Council of Ulama, even sanctioned the killing of Shias, a call that was reiterated by Wahhabi religious literature as late as 2002.\\"Toby Jones, \`The Iraq Effect in Saudi Arabia,\` Middle East Report, 237, Winter 2005, p. 24 Government policy has been to allow Shia their own mosques and to exempt Shia from Hanbali inheritance practices. Nevertheless, Shia have been forbidden all but the most modest displays on their principal festivals, which are often occasions of sectarian strife in the Persian Gulf region, with its mixed Sunni‚ÄìShia populations. According to a report by the Human Rights Watch: And Amnesty International adds: As of 2006 four of the 150 members of Saudi Arabia's \\"handpicked\\" parliament were Shia, but no city had a Shia mayor or police chief, and none of the 300 girls schools for Shia in the Eastern Province had a Shia principal. According to scholar Vali Nasr, Saudi textbooks \\"characterize Shiism as a form of heresy ... worse than Christianity and Judaism.\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 237 Forced into exile in the 1970s, Saudi Shia leader Hassan al-Saffar is said to have been \\"powerfully influenced\\" by the works of Sunni Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamaat-e-Islami and by their call for Islamic revolution and an Islamic state.\\"The Shiite Question in Saudi Arabia\\", Middle East Report, 45, International Crisis Group, 2005, p. 3. Quoted in Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 117 Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Shia in Hasa ignored the ban on mourning ceremonies commemorating Ashura. When police broke them up three days of rampage ensued‚Äîburned cars, attacked banks, looted shops‚Äîcentered around Qatif. At least 17 Shia were killed. In February 1980 disturbances were \\"less spontaneous\\" and even bloodier.Wright, Robin, Sacred Rage, Simon and Schuster, (2001), p. 150 Meanwhile, broadcasts from Iran in the name of the Islamic Revolutionary Organization attacked the monarchy, telling listeners, \\"Kings despoil a country when they enter it and make the noblest of its people its meanest ... This is the nature of monarchy, which is rejected by Islam.\\"BBC monitoring service from March 1980 quoted in William B. Quandt, Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, Brookings Institution, 1981, pp. 39‚Äì40 By 1993, Saudi Shia had abandoned uncompromising demands and some of al-Saffar's followers met with King Fahd with promises made for reform. In 2005 the new King Abdullah also relaxed some restrictions on the Shia.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 238, 240 However, Shia continue to be arrested for commemorating Ashura as of 2006.Human Rights Watch Saudi Arabia ‚Äì Events of 2006 In December 2006, amidst escalating tensions in Iraq, 38 high ranking Saudi clerics called on Sunni Muslims around the world to \\"mobilise against Shiites\\". Shia Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi is reported to have responded: * Saudi Sunni A large fraction of the foreign Sunni extremists who have entered Iraq to fight against Shia and the American occupation are thought to be Saudis. According to one estimate, of the approximately 1,200 foreign fighters captured in Syria between summer 2003 and summer 2005, 85% were Saudis. Another reflection of grassroots Wahhabi or Saudi antipathy to Shia was a statement by Saudi cleric Nasir al-Umar, who accused Iraqi Shias of close ties to the United States and argued that both were enemies of Muslims everywhere.Jones, Toby \\"The Iraq Effect in Saudi Arabia, Middle East Report 237 (Winter 2005), p. 24 * Al-Qaeda Some Wahabi groups, often labeled as takfiri and sometimes linked to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated the persecution of the Shia as heretics.Al-Zarqawi declares war on Iraqi Shia aljazeera.net, 14 September 2005 Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shias were killed in coordinated suicide bombings,Blasts target Iraq's Shia Muslims on the eve of Ashura 18 February 2005Latest Iraq blast targets Shia mosque, September 16, 2005 \\"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, vowed to wage an 'all-out war' on the country's Shia majority\\"\\"Four days after al-Qaeda in Iraq declared all-out war on the Shiite majority, more than 250 people have been killed\\" San Diego Union Tribune, 18 September 2005 but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri directed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but to focus on the occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.  Lebanon  Though sectarian tensions in Lebanon were at their height during the Lebanese Civil War, the Shia‚ÄìSunni relations were not the main conflict of the war. The Shia party/militia of Hezbollah emerged in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War as one of the strongest forces following the Israeli withdrawal in the year 2000, and the collapse of the South Lebanese Army in the South. The tensions blew into a limited warfare between Shia dominated and Sunni dominated political alliances in 2008. With the eruption of the Syrian Civil War, tensions increased between the Shia-affiliated Alawites and Sunnis of Tripoli, erupting twice into deadly violence‚Äîin June 2011, and the second time in February 2012. The Syrian war has affected Hezbollah, which was once lauded by both Sunnis and Shi'ites for its battles against Israel, but now has lost support from many Sunnis for its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The bombings are thought to be in retaliation for a large car bomb which detonated on 15 August 2013 and killed at least 24 and wounded hundreds in a part of Beirut controlled by the Hezbollah  Jordan  Although the country of Jordan is 95% Sunni and has not seen any Shia‚ÄìSunni fighting within, it has played a part in the recent Shia-Sunni strife. It is the home country of anti-Shia insurgent Raed Mansour al-Banna, who died perpetrating one of Iraq's worst suicide bombings in the city of Al-Hillah. Al-Banna killed 125 Shia and wounded another 150 in the 2005 Al Hillah bombing of a police recruiting station and adjacent open air market. In March 2005 Salt, al-Banna's home town, saw a three-day wake for al-Banna who Jordanian newspapers and celebrants proclaimed a martyr to Islam, which by definition made the Shia victims \\"infidels whose murder was justified.\\" Following the wake Shia mobs in Iraq attacked the Jordanian embassy on 20 March 2005. Ambassadors were withdrawn from both countries.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival (Norton, 2006), pp. 227‚Äì28 All this resulted despite the strong filial bonds, ties of commerce, and traditional friendship between the two neighboring countries.  Egypt  According to pew, roughly 12% of Egyptian Muslims regarded themselves as non-denominational Muslims, whilst the rest are largely Sunni. others put the number of Shias somewhere between 800,000 to about two to three million. The Syrian Civil War has brought on an increase in anti-Shia rhetoric, and what Human Rights Watch states is \\"anti-Shia hate speech by Salafis\\". In 2013 a mob of several hundred attacked a house in the village of Abu Musallim near Cairo, dragging four Shia worshipers through the street before lynching them. Eight other Shia were injured.  Yemen  Muslims in Yemen include the majority Shafi'i (Sunni) and the minority Zaidi (Shia). Zaidi are sometimes called \\"Fiver Shia\\" instead of Twelver Shia because they recognize the first four of the Twelve Imams but accept Zayd ibn Ali as their \\"Fifth ImƒÅm\\" rather than his brother Muhammad al-Baqir. Shia‚ÄìSunni conflict in Yemen involves the Shia insurgency in northern Yemen. Both Shia and Sunni dissidents in Yemen have similar complaints about the government‚Äîcooperation with the American government and an alleged failure to following Sharia lawYemen Facing Insurgency on Two Fronts, By Stephen Ulph (see above)‚Äîbut it's the Shia who have allegedly been singled out for government crackdown. During and after the US-led invasion of Iraq, members of the Zaidi-Shia community protested after Friday prayers every week outside mosques, particularly the Grand Mosque in Sana'a, during which they shouted anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans, and criticised the government's close ties to America.Amnesty Report These protests were led by ex-parliament member and Imam, Bader Eddine al- Houthi.Yemeni President: al-Houthi is an ill man, mentally abnormal In response the Yemeni government has implemented a campaign to crush to the Zaidi-Shia rebellion\\"Clashes 'leave 118 dead' in Yemen, BBC report and harass journalists.Yemen: Harassment of journalists must stop These latest measures come as the government faces a Sunni rebellion with a similar motivation to the Zaidi discontent.Yemen Facing Insurgency on Two Fronts , By Stephen Ulph, Jamestown FoundationAmnesty: Yemen: The Rule of Law Sidelined in the Name of Security Amnesty: Ratification without implementation:the state of human rights in Yemen A March 2015 suicide bombing of two mosques (used mainly by supporters of the Zaidi Shia-led Houthi rebel movement), in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, killed at least 137 people and wounded 300. The Sunni Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant movement claimed responsibility, issuing a statement saying: \\"Let the polytheist Houthis know that the soldiers of the Islamic State will not rest until we have uprooted them.\\" Both the Sunni al-Qaeda and \\"Islamic State\\" consider Shia Muslims to be heretics.  Bahrain  The small Persian Gulf island state of Bahrain has a Shia majority but is ruled by Sunni Al Khalifa family as a constitutional monarchy, with Sunni dominating the ruling class and military and disproportionately represented in the business and landownership.Momen, Moojan, Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p. 145 According to the CIA World Factbook, Al Wefaq the largest Shia political society, won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the legislature. However, Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.\\" Bahrain has many disaffected unemployed youths and many have protested Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's efforts to create a parliament as merely a \\"cooptation of the effendis\\", i.e. traditional elders and notables. Bahrain's 2002 election was widely boycotted by Shia. Mass demonstrations have been held in favor of full-fledged democracy in March and June 2005, against an alleged insult to Ayatollah Khamenei in July 2005.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 234‚Äì35  Pakistan  Pakistan's citizens have had serious Shia-Sunni discord. Almost 80% of Pakistan's Muslim population is Sunni, with 20% being Shia, but this Shia minority forms the second largest Shia population of any country,Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival (Norton), 2006, p. 160 larger than the Shia majority in Iraq. Until recently Shia‚ÄìSunni relations have been cordial, and a majority of people of both sects participated in the creation the state of Pakistan in the 1940s. Despite the fact that Pakistan is a Sunni majority country, Shias have been elected to top offices and played an important part in the country's politics. Several other top Pakistani Generals such as General Muhammad Musa. Pakistan's President Yahya Khan were Shia. Former President Asif Ali Zardari is a Shia. There are many intermarriages between Shia and Sunnis in Pakistan. Unfortunately, from 1987‚Äì2007, \\"as many as 4,000 people are estimated to have died\\" in Shia-Sunni sectarian fighting in Pakistan\\", 300 being killed in 2006. Amongst the culprits blamed for the killing are Al-Qaeda working \\"with local sectarian groups\\" to kill what they perceive as Shia apostates, and \\"foreign powers ... trying to sow discord.\\" Most violence takes place in the largest province of Punjab and the country's commercial and financial capital, Karachi. There have also been conflagrations in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Azad Kashmir, with several hundreds of Shia Hazara killed in Balochistan killed since 2008. Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi Sunnis and Wahhabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad. Whereas Iran has been funding Shia militant groups such as Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan, resulting in tit-for-tat attacks on each other. Pakistan has become a battleground between Saudi Arabia-funded Deobandi Sunni and Wahhabis and Iran- funded Shia resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims. * Background Some see a precursor of Pakistani Shia‚ÄìSunni strife in the April 1979 execution of deposed President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on questionable charges by Islamic fundamentalist General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 89 Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as \\"Sunnification\\" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni fiqh. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the Islamization laws in the capital Islamabad. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), pp. 161‚Äì62 Shia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and Ahl al-Hadith madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric Israr Ahmed. Muhammad Manzour Numani, a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism. The book, which \\"became the gospel of Deobandi militants\\" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 164 Anti-Shia groups in Pakistan include the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, offshoots of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI). The groups demand the expulsion of all Shias from Pakistan and have killed hundreds of Pakistani Shias between 1996 and 1999.Rashid, Taliban (2000), p. 194 As in Iraq they \\"targeted Shia in their holy places and mosques, especially during times of communal prayer.\\" Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 166 From January to May 1997, Sunni terror groups assassinated 75 Shia community leaders \\"in a systematic attempt to remove Shias from positions of authority.\\"Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 167 Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has declared Shia to be \\"American agents\\" and the \\"near enemy\\" in global jihad.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 168 An example of an early Shia‚ÄìSunni fitna shootout occurred in Kurram, one of the tribal agencies of the Northwest Pakistan, where the Pushtun population was split between Sunnis and Shia. In September 1996 more than 200 people were killed when a gun battle between teenage Shia and Sunni escalated into a communal war that lasted five days. Women and children were kidnapped and gunmen even executed out-of-towners who were staying at a local hotel.Kaplan, Robert, Soldiers of Allah: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan, New York: Vintage Departures, 2001, p. 242 \\"Over 80,000 Pakistani Islamic militants have trained and fought with the Taliban since 1994. They form a hardcore of Islamic activists, ever-ready to carry out a similar Taliban-style Islamic revolution in Pakistan.\\", according to Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid.  Afghanistan  Shia‚ÄìSunni strife in Pakistan is strongly intertwined with that in Afghanistan. Though now deposed, the anti-Shia Afghan Taliban regime helped anti-Shia Pakistani groups and vice versa. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, have sent thousands of volunteers to fight with the Taliban regime and \\"in return the Taliban gave sanctuary to their leaders in the Afghan capital of Kabul.\\"Rashid, Taliban (2000), p. 263 Shia‚ÄìSunni strife inside of Afghanistan has mainly been a function of the puritanical Sunni Taliban's clashes with Shia Afghans, primarily the Hazara ethnic group. In 1998 more than 8,000 noncombatants were killed when the Taliban attacked Mazar-i-Sharif and Bamiyan where many Hazaras live.Goodson, Afghanistan's Endless War, (2001), p. 79 Some of the slaughter was indiscriminate, but many were Shia targeted by the Taliban. Taliban commander and governor Mullah Niazi banned prayer at Shia mosquesRashid,Taliban (2000), p. 73 and expressed takfir of the Shia in a declaration from Mazar's central mosque: Assisting the Taliban in the murder of Iranian diplomatic and intelligence officials at the Iranian Consulate in Mazar were \\"several Pakistani militants of the anti-Shia, Sipah-e-Sahaba party.\\"Rashid,Taliban (2000), p. 74  Nigeria  In Nigeria‚Äîthe most populous country in Africa‚Äîuntil recently almost all Muslims were Sunni. As of 2017, estimates of the number of Nigeria's 90‚Äì95 million Muslims who are Shia vary from between 20 million (Shia estimate), to less than five million (Sunni estimate). In the 1980s, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky‚Äîa Nigerian admirer of the Iranian Revolution who lived in Iran for some years and converted to Shia Islam‚Äîestablished the Islamic Movement of Nigeria. The movement has established \\"more than 300 schools, Islamic centers, a newspaper, guards and a \`martyrs‚Äô foundation\`\\". Its network is similar to that of Hezbollah in Lebanon, with a focus on Iran, its Supreme Leader, and fighting America as the enemy of Islam. According to a former U.S. State Department specialist on Nigeria, Matthew Page, the Islamic Movement receives \\"about $10,000 a month\\" in Iranian funding. Many of the converted are poor Muslims. The Shia campaign has clashed with Saudi Arabian, which also funds religious centers, school, and trains students and clerics, but as part of an effort to spread its competing Wahabbi interpretation of Islam. According to Wikileaks, \\"Saudi cables\\" released in 2015 \\"reveal concern\\" about \\"Iran-driven Shiite expansion from Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Nigeria\\" to Shia Islam has taken place in Nigeria since the Iranian Revolution. Shia Muslims protest that they have been persecuted by the Nigerian government. In 1998 Nigerian President General Sani Abacha accused Ibrahim El-Zakzaky Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p. 156 of being a Shia. In December 2015 the Nigerian government alleged that the Islamic Movement attempted to kill Nigeria's army chief-of- staff. In retaliation, troops killed more than 300 Shiites in the city of Zaria. Hundreds of El-Zakzaky's followers were also arrested. As of 2019, El- Zakzaky was still imprisoned.  South East Asia  Islam is the dominant religion in Indonesia, which also has a larger Muslim population than any other country in the world, with approximately 202.9 million identified as Muslim (88.2% of the total population) as of 2009. The majority adheres to the Sunni Muslim tradition mainly of the Shafi'i madhhab.Religious clash in Indonesia kills up to six, Straits Times, 6 February 2011 Around one million are Shias, who are concentrated around Jakarta. In general, the Muslim community can be categorized in terms of two orientations: \\"modernists,\\" who closely adhere to orthodox theology while embracing modern learning; and \\"traditionalists,\\" who tend to follow the interpretations of local religious leaders (predominantly in Java) and religious teachers at Islamic boarding schools (pesantren). In Indonesia, in 2015, Sunni clerics denounced the Shia as \\"heretics\\", and the mayor of Bogor proposed banning the Shia Ashura holy day. The Shia community has also been subject to hate campaigns and intimidation, with fears of this escalating into violence. Malaysia claims to be a tolerant Islamic state, however since 2010 it has banned the preaching of Shia Islam, with a \\"particular ferocity\\" and warns against Shiism with its, \\"evil and blasphemous beliefs\\".  United States  In late 2006 or early 2007, in what journalist Seymour Hersh called The Redirection, the United States changed its policy in the Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, with the goal of \\"containing\\" Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly Iraq could have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing can be done about this as Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States‚Äô support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising is the latest in a long history of US support to keep the Shiites in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states. One analyst told CNN that the US strategy on putting pressure on Iran by arming its Sunni neighbors is not a new strategy for the United States.  Europe  In Europe Shia- Sunni acrimony is part of life for tens of millions of European Muslims.  Australia  Conflict between religious groups in the Middle East have spread to the Australian Muslim community and within Australian schools. =Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant= As of March 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (or ISIS/ISIL, Daesh), a Salafi jihadi extremist militant group and self-proclaimed caliphate and Islamic state led by Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria, had control over territory occupied by ten million people in Iraq and Syria, as well as limited territorial control in some other countries. The United Nations has held ISIS responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a \\"historic scale\\", including attacks on Shia Muslims. According to Shia rights watch, in 2014 ISIS forces killed over 1,700 Shia civilians at Camp Speicher in Tikrit Iraq, and 670 Shia prisoners at the detention facility on the outskirts of Mosul. In June 2014, the New York Times wrote that as ISIS has \\"seized vast territories\\" in western and northern Iraq, there have been \\"frequent accounts of fighters‚Äô capturing groups of people and releasing the Sunnis while the Shiites are singled out for execution\\". The report listed questions ISIS uses to \\"tell whether a person is a Sunni or a Shiite\\"‚ÄîWhat is your name? Where do you live? How do you pray? What kind of music do you listen to? After the collapse of the Iraqi army and capture of the city of Mosul by ISIS in June 2014, the \\"most senior\\" Shia spiritual leader based in Iraq, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who had been known as \\"pacifist\\" in his attitudes, issued a fatwa calling for jihad against ISIS and its Sunni allies, which was seen by the Shia militias as a \\"de facto legalization of the militias‚Äô advance\\". In Qatari another Shiite preacher, Nazar al-Qatari, \\"put on military fatigues to rally worshipers after evening prayers,\\" calling on them to fight against ‚Äúthe slayers of Imams Hasan and Hussein‚Äù (the second and third Imams of Shia history) and for Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Shia militias fighting ISIS have also been accused of atrocities. Human Rights Watch has accused government-backed Shia militias of kidnapping and killing scores of Sunni civilians in 2014. Unity efforts In a special interview broadcast on Al Jazeera on 14 February 2007, former Iranian president and chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and highly influential Sunni scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi, \\"stressed the impermissibility of the fighting between the Sunnis and the Shi‚Äôis\\" and the need to \\"be aware of the conspiracies of the forces of hegemony and Zionism which aim to weaken [Islam] and tear it apart in Iraq.\\" Even on this occasion there were differences, with Rafsanjani openly asking \\"more than once who started\\" the inter-Muslim killing in Iraq, and Al- Qaradawi denying claims by Rafsanjani that he knew where \\"those arriving to Iraq to blow Shi‚Äôi shrines up are coming from\\". =Saudi-Iran summit= In a milestone for the two countries' relations, on 3 March 2007 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held an extraordinary summit meeting. They displayed mutual warmth with hugs and smiles for cameras and promised \\"a thaw in relations between the two regional powers but stopped short of agreeing on any concrete plans to tackle the escalating sectarian and political crises throughout the Middle East.\\" On his return to Tehran, Ahmadinejad declared that: Saudi officials had no comment about Ahmadinejad's statements, but the Saudi official government news agency did say: Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud bin Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz said: Effort to bring unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims had been attempted by Allama Muhammad Taqi Qummi. =Scholarly opinions= Sunni *Sheikh Mahmoud Shaltut: In a Fatwa Sheikh Shaltut declared worship according to the doctrine of the Twelve Shia to be valid and recognized the Shiite as an Islamic School. * Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy: ¬´I think that anyone who believes that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is his Messenger is definitely a Muslim. Therefore, we have been supporting, for a long time, through Al-Azhar, many calls for the reconciliation of Islamic schools of thought. Muslims should work on becoming united, and protecting themselves from denominational sectarian fragmentation. There are no Shiites and no Sunni. We are all Muslims. Regretfully; the passions and prejudices that some resort to, are the reason behind the fragmentation of the Islamic nation.¬ª * Sheikh Mohammed al- Ghazali: It is the duty of all Muslims to unite against enemies of Islam and their propaganda. * Sheikh Abd al-Majid Salim: In a letter that was sent to Ayatollah Borujerdi by Sheikh Abd al-Majid Salim, was written:¬´The first thing that becomes obligatory to scholars, Shia or Sunni, is removing dissension from the minds of Muslims.¬ª * Doctor Vasel Nasr The Grand Mufti of Egypt: ¬´We ask Allah to create unity among Muslims and remove any enmity, disagreement and contention in the ancillaries of Fiqh between them.¬ª Shiite *Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi: Ayatollah Borujerdi sent a letter to Sheikh Abd al-Majid Salim, the Grand Mufti of Sunnis and former Chancellor of Al-Azhar University and wrote: ¬´I ask Almighty Allah to change ignorance, separation and distribution among different Islamic Schools to each other, to the actual knowledge and kindness and solidarity.¬ª *Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini: ¬´We are Oneness with Sunni Muslims. We are their brothers.¬ª ¬´It is obligatory for all Muslims that Maintain unity.¬ª *Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei: In a Fatwa about creating dissension, Ayatollah Khamenei said: ¬´In Addition to dissension is contrary to the Qur'an and Sunnah, this weakens Muslims. So, creating dissension is forbid (Haram).¬ª *Ayatollah Ali al- Sistani: (In answer to the question:¬´Is anyone who says Shahadah, prays and follow one of the Islamic Schools, a Muslim?¬ª, Ayatollah Sistani replied: ¬´Every one who says Shahadah, acts as you describe and does not have enmity towards Ahl al-Bayt, is muslim.¬ª See also * Amman Message * Anti-Shi'ism * Criticism of Twelver Shia Islam * Glossary of Islam * Index of Islam-related articles * International Islamic Unity Conference (Iran) * Kharijite * Organisation of Islamic Cooperation * Outline of Islam * Rafida * Shia Muslims in the Arab world * Sunni fatwas on Shias * The World Forum for Proximity of Islamic Schools of Thought * Sufi‚ÄìSalafi relations References * Further reading  The Arab Shia: The Forgotten Muslims, by Graham E.

Race recap Qualifying was cancelled on March 24 due to snow, sleet and rain, and the field was set with top 35 owners points from 2005, the Champion's Provisional (for Terry Labonte) and seven others, based on qualifying attempts in 2006. As a result, 2005 champion Tony Stewart sat on the pole. The race featured 18 cautions, and over 100 of the 500 laps were run under the yellow flag. Points leader Jimmie Johnson made contact with the car of Reed Sorenson, which caused a flat tire and put the #48 car several laps down; this would lead to him finishing 30th. Lap 188 saw the most notable wreck of the first half of the race, where Clint Bowyer spun Dave Blaney, causing a chain reaction collecting David Stremme, Brian Vickers, and Michael Waltrip. This brought out a red flag to cleanup. Jeff Gordon spun Martin Truex, Jr. out on lap 415, collecting Jeff Burton, Robby Gordon, and J. J. Yeley. Kurt Busch, who had made up two laps lost earlier in the day due to tire problems, used the \\"bump-and-run\\" to nudge Matt Kenseth out of the lead with four laps to go. Gordon used the same tactic to take third but on the final lap, Kenseth used the bump and run to spin Gordon out as Busch raced to victory. Gordon finished 21st and was involved in a shoving match with Kenseth on pit road after the race, for which he was put on probation and fined $10,000 by NASCAR. Kurt Busch celebrates after winning the 2006 Food City 500. Besides the dyed between Gordon and Kenseth, there also was bitter rivalry shown between Busch and Kevin Harvick following contact last week at Atlanta. During the pre-race ceremonies and in the drivers meeting, Harvick spent his time taunting Busch for no good reason. Busch ignored his insults and dismissed reporters. Harvick had been complaining about Busch all week and once retorted that Roger Penske (Busch's team owner) would make a fool of himself in hiring Busch. NASCAR warned Busch and Harvick that if they got into a feud on the track, they would get penalized. Busch later won the race and Harvick ended up second. When interviewed, Kevin was not finished and said \\"I am glad for my second-place spot but seeing Kurt [Busch] up there is terrible. I hate to see him win. He is a big whiner.\\" The win was Busch's fifth in 11 career races at the track and the fifteenth in his career. It was Dodge's first win at Bristol since Richard Petty in 1975.

He also released solo work and collaborated with many other artists.  Biography  Garcia, from a Hawaiian, Irish and English background, had played in some small bands when he auditioned for Eurythmics. He had played bass guitar as part of Eurythmics' live band in 1983‚Äì84 and on two of their studio albums, Touch and Be Yourself Tonight. Dean Garcia and Toni Halliday were introduced to each other by David A. Stewart from Eurythmics. The pair formed an ill-fated group named State of Play in the mid-1980s before parting ways, embarking on a no less ill-fated solo career (Halliday) and further stints as a backing musician (Garcia), and then reuniting for a more long-term partnership in Curve. Garcia and Halliday collaborated in Curve between 1990 and 2005. The group's career was interrupted by several periods of inactivity. Garcia played bass, guitar, drums for Curve, while Halliday sang, wrote the lyrics and occasionally played guitar. Outside Curve, Garcia has collaborated with other artists like Eurythmics, Sin√©ad O'Connor, and Tom Petty, as a session and touring musician. He released \\"solo\\" material (Mushiness in 1999 and Crosseyedrabbit in 2003) under the guise of Headcase while still a member of Curve. Dean Garcia is currently a member of the band SPC ECO with his daughter Rose Berlin and Joey Levenson (2007‚Äìpresent). In February 2009, SPC ECO released their first album, 3-D, through their website and via Collide's label Noiseplus Music. 3-D was followed by the albums You Tell Me in 2011 and Dark Notes in 2012.

Batson (1921‚Äì2003), was an American civil rights activist and outspoken advocate of equal education. She spoke out about the desegregation of Boston Public Schools, served on the Public Education Committee of the NAACP Boston Branch and later served as the executive director of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO). Throughout her life, in various professional roles, she championed fair and equal public education. Biography Ruth Marion (Watson) Batson was born August 3, 1921 in Roxbury, Massachusetts to Jamaican immigrants, Joel R. Watson and Cassandra D. Buchanan. She attended the Everett School in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Batson graduated from the Girls Latin School in 1939. Batson attended the Nursery Training School of Boston, which was associated with Boston University. She later received a Master of Education degree from Boston University in 1976. At age nineteen, Watson married John C. Batson. They had three daughters together: Cassandra Way, Susan Batson, and Dorothy Owusu. John Batson died in 1971. Ruth Batson died on October 28, 2003, at the age of 82. Career Inspired by her mother's interest in civil rights, Batson became the chairman of the Public Education Sub-Committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1953. In April 1957, she became the chairwoman of the New England Regional Conference of the NAACP, where she worked as a civil rights lobbyist. In the early 1960s, she challenged the Boston School Committee, charging that Boston Public Schools were largely segregated. She also pointed out that schools with high black enrollments received inadequate facilities. Batson accused school administrators with ignoring \\"a basic American concept that equal opportunity should be available to all people regardless of race, color, or creed.\\" Batson was the first black woman on the Democratic National Committee and the first woman elected president of NAACP's New England Regional Conference, a role in which she served from 1957 to 1960. After serving as chairwoman of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination from 1963 to 1966, she helped launched the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) voluntary desegregation program. As associate director then director, she helped guide METCO's growth from transporting 225 black urban children to several suburbs to 1,125 children to 28 communities. She stepped down in 1969. She served in several roles at Boston University: director of the consultation and education program (1970‚Äì1975), director of the school desegregation research project (1975‚Äì1981), coordinator of the clinical task force, and associate professor at the School of Medicine's Division of Psychiatry. Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions In 1989 Batson received an honorary Doctorate of Pedagogy from Northeastern University. In 1993, she received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston. She was a member of the board of visitors of Boston University's School of Medicine; trustees, Boston City Hospital; member, Corporation of the Massachusetts General Hospital and former member of its board of trustees; and board member of Roxbury Community College Foundation. Publications She was the author of The Black Educational Movement in Boston: A Sequence of Historical Events (1638‚Äì1975), a comprehensive chronology documenting the heroic efforts and contributions of African American parents to educational history in Boston. Northeastern University's School of Education printed the manuscript of nearly 900 pages in October, 2001. Philanthropy She was the founder in 1969 of the Ruth M. Batson Educational Foundation, which provided grants to African American college students for tuition and emergency needs. The Batson Foundation also awards grants to educational institutions and community organizations whose program objectives reflect the philosophy of the Batson Foundation. More recently, Batson had directed the revitalized Museum of African American History in Beacon Hill, stepping down in 1990. Her financial support for medical students at Boston University School of Medicine, the school, under the leadership of Dr. Aram Chobanian, established the Ruth Batson Scholarship in 1997. Since that time, the school has awarded more than US$500,000 in scholarships to 40 Boston University minority medical students, including four MD and PhD students. Each year, Batson visited the medical center to have lunch with the Batson Scholars, hear their life's stories and share her experiences, especially with the health care system in America.

Following the path The north end of the trail is most readily accessed from Craigieburn railway station. The trail starts at the intersection of Stockton Street and Aitken Creek close to the station. Follow Aitken Creek for 1.8 km until you reach the back entrance gate of the Craigieburn Public Golf course. Rather than continuing through the golf course along Aitken Creek, proceed in a southerly direction via Axminster Drv. It soon forms a path made out of the ends of a series of cull de sacs. About a 1 km from Aitken Creek a small wetland appears. Follow the trail here until a large solitary palm comes into view. Head for the palm, then continue along a short goat track on its far side, that crosses a narrow easement. Pick up the path on the other side of the easement. Now in Roxburgh Park, the path winds round some streets and crosses an open section and then runs between some contemporary terrace like houses. It breaks into an open park area, where the path forms a figure of eight. At the south end of the park, it passes through a distinct line of trees running west east and crosses a large power transmission line easement. While possible, do not go east at this point. Continue in a southerly direction. From here the path runs for another 8 km through a section that is easy to navigate and arrives at Barry Rd in Westmeadows. Passing by a couple of ovals on the left, the path reaches a footbridge about 0.4 km from Barry Rd. Cross the bridge and arrive at the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail.

The two sections are separated by a 0.85 km section of path along the Western Ring Road Trail. Bicycle Victoria announced on 7 August 2009 on its web site that the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) had approved the issuing of permits for the Lower Darebin Trail and associated bridge over the Yarra. Work on the Lower Darebin trail started late in 2010, and is expected to be completed in 2015. Following the path The northern section starts on the very edge of Melbourne surburbia next to open countryside. Travelling south through remnant vegetation and 2.2 km later, one arrives at Hendersons Rd. Epping station is 500m to the west along Hendersons Rd and the station is soon followed by Epping Plaza. The path arrives at Childs Road, 1.3 km further along, having crossed a small footbridge earlier. Cross the Childs Road bridge to the east. The Hendersons Road Drain Trail is on the left (north) and the Darebin Creek Trail continues on the right (south), on the other side of Childs Road. 900m later the path forks to the left and right. Take the path towards the footbridge but do not cross it - continue straight ahead. After 2 km, McKimmies Road is approached. The path does not proceed under the road. Cross McKimmies Road and continue on for 1.6 km through Thomastown East Reserve. A small wetland nearby harbours the Growling Grass Frog. The path intersects with the Western Ring Road Trail. Travel 850m east along the Western Ring Road Trail to where the Darebin Creek Trail continues to the south on its west bank, crossing under the Western Ring Road. The creek name is signed for road users only but is clearly visible for trail users. Leaving the Western Ring Road Trail the southern section starts by descending to the creek and tracking along the west bank of the creek. After crossing McCleans Road, the path splits in two, as it enters a Norris Bank Reserve. Either path can be taken as they rejoin at the far end of the reserve at Settlement Road. On the south side of Settlement Road the path continues on the west side of the creek for 2.6 km until it reaches the eastern end of Rathcown Rd, by a farm full of sheep. Continue for 600 metres along Rathcown Rd until you arrive at a dead-end. The path resumes on the left by following the creek again. At Dunne Street and Plenty Rd, change sides of the creek. An unsigned path looms up on the left, that leads to the Bundoora campus of La Trobe University and is surveyed by a lone park bench. 800m later cross the footbridge to the east bank of the creek. The trail continues south past another footbridge on the right (west) that leads to Northland Shopping Centre. Do not cross the bridge, just continue onwards. One km later the bitumen trail meets a crossing with a concrete trail. Turn right (west) onto the concrete trail and head downhill. Going straight ahead on the bitumen trail leads to the Austin Hospital helipad (Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital) near Bell Street. Three km later the trail meets the north end of Ford Grove. Continue to the south end of Ford Grove where the trail continues. After another 500m the trail forks at a wooden boardwalk section: To the left (east) it crosses a footbridge. Take the right path and continue straight ahead towards Smith Street. The trail passes under the large and high steel bridge that carries the Hurstbridge railway line, and then under the bluestone and concrete Darebin Creek Bridge (Heidelberg Road), before finishing at Sparks Reserve. The pedestrian and cycling bridge spanning the Yarra River, connecting the Darebin Creek Trail to the Main Yarra Trail, was opened on the 25th of March 2018.

She was married to fellow writer and journalist Ludu U Hla and was the mother of popular writer Nyi Pu Lay. She is best known for her outspoken anti-government views and radical left wing journalism besides her outstanding work on traditional Burmese arts, theatre, dance and music, and several works of translation from English, both fiction and non-fiction. Student writer and activist Born into an old established Mandalay family that traded in tobacco and manufactured cheroots, Amar was the fourth in a family of twelve, of whom only six survived to adulthood. She was educated at the American Baptist Mission School and subsequently the National High School under the headmaster Abdul Razak who later became the Education Minister in Aung San's cabinet and was assassinated with him and others in July 1947. She read science at the Mandalay Intermediate College and went on to Rangoon University for a bachelor's degree. Her first notable work was a translation of Trials in Burma by Maurice Collis in 1938, and by that time she was already published in the university's Owei (, Peacock's Call) magazine, and also Kyipwa Yay (, Progress) magazine, run by her future husband U Hla, under her own name as well as the pen names Mya Myint Zu and Khin La Win.Ludu Amei hnit kouze () - People's Mother at 90 (in Burmese), 2005, Kama-yingw√® Books, Yangon, 10-16,23,51,108,137 When the second university students strike in history broke out in 1936, Amar and her friend from Mandalay M.A. Ma Ohn became famous as women student leaders among the strikers camped out on the terraces of the Shwedagon Pagoda. U Hla was a staunch supporter of the strike and started courting Amar; in 1939 they got married and U Hla moved his magazine to Mandalay. Wartime Kyipwa Yay The family fled to the countryside north of Mandalay when the Second World War broke out in the East in 1942, but the magazine continued to come out. Daw Amar translated one of the three wartime bestsellers of the Japanese soldier writer Hino Ashihei called Wheat and Soldiers (, ) and published it together with the other two translated by her husband. She also translated The Rainbow (, Thettant yaung) by the Czechoslovak writer Wanda Wasilewska in 1945, printed on blue matchbox wrapping paper, the only kind of paper available at the time. Both husband and wife became involved in the Resistance movement against the Japanese Occupation, and formed the Asha Lu Nge (, Asia Youth) organisation in Mandalay. Her husband was arrested briefly by the military authorities after the recapture of the city by the British Fourteenth Army on account of the Hino Ashihei books. Postwar Ludu At the end of the war in 1945 U Hla launched a fortnightly paper called the Ludu Journal () - Ludu is Burmese for 'the people/masses' - with Amar as his assistant editor. The Ludu Daily was successfully launched the following year and the couple subsequently came to be known as Ludu U Hla and Ludu Daw Amar. Their incisive political commentaries and analyses made a significant contribution to the country's yearning for independence and unified struggle against colonial rule. Their publications had never carried advertisements for alcohol, drugs to enhance sexual performance or gambling, nor racing tips, salacious affairs and gossip. U Hla had to be persuaded to make an exception of film advertisements for the survival of the paper. One morning in 1948, soon after Burma gained her independence from Britain, however, the Kyipwa Yay Press in Mandalay was dynamited to rubble by government troops who were angry that the Ludu couple appeared to be sympathetic to the Communists. This was a time when regime change happened quite often with the city falling into the hands, in turn, of the Karen rebels, Communists and the new Socialist government under U Nu. The entire family, including two pregnant women, was thrown out into the street, lined up and was about to be gunned down when a number of monks and locals successfully intervened to save their lives. In 1953 Amar travelled abroad to the World Democratic Women's Conference in Copenhagen, World Peace Conference in Budapest, and 4th World Festival of Youth and Students in Bucharest. In October 1953 the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) government of U Nu imprisoned U Hla under Section 5 for sedition as a political prisoner after publishing a controversial news story in the paper and he spent over three years in Rangoon's Central Jail until his release in January 1957. They had five children by now, with the youngest Nyein Chan ( his given name means 'peace' in Burmese, pseudonym Nyi Pu Lay b. 1952) barely a toddler. In March 1959 the paper was sealed off by the authorities, and it did not come out again until May the next year. Amar travelled to Moscow in 1962 as an invited guest by Aeroflot Russian Airlines and visited East Germany, Czechoslovakia and China. U Hla and Daw Amar were well known to foreign students of Burmese as well as Burmese writers, journalists and artists; the younger generation of budding writers and artists called them 'U-Lay' (Uncle) and 'Daw Daw' (Aunty). Their home, Ludu Taik (Ludu House) on 84th. and 33rd, and always open to such visitors, was often their first port of call in Mandalay. Military era A poem for the \\"Mother of Mandalay\\" - 85th. birthday tribute, November 2000 The Ludu Daily was closed down by the military government on July 7, 1967. The paper had openly championed for peace and a socialist society, and came out very strongly in support of the peace parley in 1963 between the Revolutionary Council government of Ne Win and various insurgent groups, both Communist and ethnic, just as they had done before in the early years of the civil war in the 1950s. When the peace talks broke down, Amar's oldest son Soe Win (b. 1941), aged 22 and a student leader at Rangoon University, went underground with a few others to join the Communist Party of Burma. He was killed in a bloody purge in 1967 in the jungles of Bago Yoma mountains when the CPB carried out its own cultural revolution. The Ludu couple, true to Burmese Buddhist attitude to death, declined an invitation from the authorities to visit their first born's jungle grave. Their second son Po Than Gyaung (b. 1945) was also arrested for alleged clandestine student political activities at Mandalay University in July 1966, aged 21, and detained without charge or trial until May 1972. He spent part of his imprisonment in Mandalay Prison and later on Cocos Island Penal Colony in the Andaman Sea. They were personally known to Ne Win from the early days, and the latter often called at their place whenever he visited Mandalay. They carried on with writing, researching, organising literary seminars, giving talks and publishing material other than domestic politics, and remained active in social and community affairs. In 1975 they accepted the government's invitation to give talks to university students from both Mandalay and Rangoon taking part in the reconstruction of the temples in Bagan damaged by the great earthquake of the same year. Amar was given the epithet 'tough by name, tough by nature' by some people (amar means 'tough/hardy' in Burmese). Publications Daw Amar had written several books including biographies, travelogues, treatises on traditional Burmese culture, and numerous articles in various magazines, some of them autobiographical and many collected into books later. # ' - President Ho Chi Minh 1950 # ' - To the Socialist Lands 1963 # ' - Artistes that People Loved 1964; it won the national award for Literature on Burmese Culture and Arts in the same year. # , Po Sein, Sein Gadoun - Theatre performers of the same names 1967 # ' - Artists of the same names in 2 volumes 1969 # ' - Theatre performer of the same name 1970 # ' - Traditional open air performance in 2 volumes 1973 # ' - The World's Biggest Book 1973, English translation by Dr. Than Tun 1974 # Shwedaungtaung Articles 1975, translated into Japanese by Yasuko Dobashi aka Yin Yin Mya 1994 # Sayagyi Thakin Kodaw Hmaing - a biography of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing 1976 # ' - From the Chindwin to the Sea: a travelogue 1985 # ' - Burma's Classical Music 1989 # ' - Tobacco and Man, co-authored with U Hla (Daw Amar smoked from 8 years of age till her 40s) # ' - Mandalayans 1991 # ' - Mandalay, Our Mandalay 1993 # ' - The Royal Teachers (Buddhist Abbots): the Light of Sasana 1994 # ' - When We Were Young 1994 # ' - From Taung Layloun to Natkyun: Words to Remember # ' - The World's Biggest Stone Image 1996 # ' - Modern Burmese Art 1997 # ' - Mother's Words of Old in 2 volumes 1997, vol 3 2007 # ' - Eighty Three Years Eighty Three Words 1998 # ' - Windows on South Asia 1990 # ' - My Husband My Young Love 2001 # ' - The Twelve-Season Festival Traders and Our Upcountry 2002 # ' - Nostalgia 2003 # ' - Customers in a Bookstore: Musings 2004] # Short Stories 2006 Translated works from English include: # Trials in Burma by Maurice Collis in 2 volumes 1938 # Sandamala by Maurice Collis 1940 # Wheat and Soldiers by Hino Ashihei 1945 # The Rainbow by Wanda Wasilewska 1945 # The Challenge of Red China by Gunther Stein in 2 volumes 1949 # In the Name of Peace by Archie John Stone 1953 # Listen Yankees by C.

She was arrested together with her husband and their youngest son Nyein Chan in 1978, after her second son Po Than Gyaung went underground to join the Communist Party of Burma (current spokesman for the CPB) just like his late brother Soe Win before him in 1963. Daw Amar and Nyein Chan were not released for more than a year from prison until later in 1979 after U Hla had been released. Nyein Chan was re-arrested in December 1989 this time to spend nearly 10 years in prison. Po Than Gyaung, now living in exile in Yunnan, would never see his mother again. U Hla died in 1982 after 43 years of marriage, five children and six grandchildren. The Ludu couple had been one of the best known husband-and- wife teams among the Burmese literati. Daw Amar suffered another loss when her printing plants and warehouses burnt down in the great fire of 1984 that wiped out the heart of Mandalay. Since she turned 70 in 1985, Daw Amar's birthday had been celebrated by the world of art and literature in Burma every year. The event had become an unofficial convention of dissidents under the watchful eyes of the ever-present Military Intelligence Service, normally taking place at Taung Laylone Monastery by the shores of Taungthaman Lake in Amarapura near Mandalay until November 2006 when the venue had to be changed under pressure from the authorities. She remained active in public life and was instrumental in founding the Byamazo Luhmuyay Athin (Mutual Voluntary Aid Association) in 1998 engaged in helping poor families with the cost of healthcare and funeral arrangements. She had been called 'Mother of the People' and 'Grand Old Lady'. In a society where old age is revered, most people would address her as Amei (Mother) the same as she would refer to herself according to Burmese custom. \\"For those of us who don't dance to the tune of the authorities, we must be creative in what we write to get our message across\\" she said confirming that there was no freedom of press in Burma. She regretted that she had to give up journalism, and could only write about tradition and culture. In her articles collected later into \\"Mother's Words of Old\\", she bemoaned the loosening of social cohesion, morals, and traditional values in dress and manner which she blamed on economic disorder, consumerism and globalisation, and Chinese immigration. She once wrote that the Chinese had occupied Mandalay without firing a shot, and had dubbed the present Lawpan (boss in Chinese) era; she felt as if Mandalay was an undeclared colony of Yunnan Province. Daw Amar was a staunch defender of Burmese history, culture, religion and sovereignty embodied in her birthplace, the last royal capital of Burma, Mandalay - thus broadly nationalistic, religious and ethnocentric traditionalist in her perspective, and yet she had been in the forefront of modernising the written language, fostering mutual understanding and friendship between the dominant Bamar and the ethnic minorities in tandem with her husband, promoting sex education and public awareness of the HIV/AIDS problem, and voicing complaints regarding unpaid labour contributions of women in society. Ludu Daw Amar died on 7 April 2008 at the age of 92. Her home was Ludu Taik in Mandalay with her second daughter Tin Win (b. 1947) in charge of the publishing business and her youngest son Nyein Chan (writer Nyi Pu Lay - b. 1952) and his family.
