It opened in 1995 and was named for the original Electric Factory (see below). The standing-room-only capacity is approximately 2,500 to 3,000 people, including the second-floor area which overlooks the stage from stage left. Spectators in this area often have the bonus of being able to view a portion of the backstage. The venue features a variety of musical acts in the rap, electronic, heavy metal, rock, grunge, and pop genres. The Factory was host to the filming of Underoath, Yellowcard and Lamb of God's live DVDs, and most recently, The Starting Line, along with a live recording from The Fray. The Philadelphia-based livetronica band, The Disco Biscuits, have played more shows (most of them sold out) in the history of The Electric Factory than any other band. In addition to being a concert venue, Electric Factory is available for Private Parties and Corporate Functions. In 2018, the Electric Factory was sold to The Bowery Presents, who temporarily called it \\"North Seventh\\" while they held a contest to rename the venue. In October 2018, the new name was announced as Franklin Music Hall. Electric Factory, 1968-1973 The original Electric Factory was founded by Sheldon Kaplan, Herbert Spivak, and his brothers Jerry Spivak and Allen Spivak. They soon hired Larry Magid to book all of the shows. Kaplan sold his stake in the company after the Atlantic City Pop Festival and Magid stepped up to become a partner. The original venue was a converted tire warehouse on the northwest corner of 22nd and Arch Streets, which opened in 1968, and was originally called the \\"Electric Factory & Flea Market.\\" A few doors down on the north side of Arch Street, between 21st and 22nd streets, was the first concert venue in that area, independent of the Electric Factory, a place called the \\"Trauma.\\" The first performers, on February 2, 1968, were the Chambers Brothers. The building closed in 1973, and was eventually torn down and replaced with condominiums. Coincident with the venue, Electric Factory Concerts began as a concert promotions firm, also owned by Larry Magid. It went on to become the dominant concert promoter in Philadelphia.

After the watershed passage of the United States Noise Control Act of 1972,U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, - other local and state governments passed further regulations. A noise regulation restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day. Although the United Kingdom and Japan enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government. History NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure =United States initial legislation= In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure. Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a nuisance lawsuit would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had testified before Congress that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-occupational noise high enough to cause hearing loss and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988 NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including noise pollution, and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city ordinances prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of Portland, Oregon, which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.\\"City of Portland Code and Charter.\\" Title 18, Chapter 18.18 \\"Title 18 Noise Control\\" Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA's role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure. =Follow-up on initial U.S. laws= Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded housing programs in the United States. They also gave states and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their planning and zoning decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level. Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a \\"disturbing, harmful or dangerous\\" impact.U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988. This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The EPA coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The EPA phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates aircraft noise by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by \\"stage\\" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 ‚Äì Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The FAA also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control highway noise as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise. Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a \\"Noise Element of the General Plan,\\" which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public. Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local police powers.Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. \\"Noise Regulations & Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns.\\" Accessed 2010-08-19. =Japan= Japan actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000. =Europe and Asia= Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). Environmental noise is a special definition in the European directive 2002/49/EC article 10.1. Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe Local ordinances are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled industrial noise penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give noise control officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines. In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, \\"National Association of Noise Control Officials.\\" Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation. Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved. * Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare Kryter, K.D., \\"The Effects of Noise on Man‚Äù, Academic Press, 1970Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. \\"Guidelines for Community Noise\\", World Health Organization, 1999Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974 One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences. Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types. The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples. The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint. The only feasible legal basis for a community's right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects. It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns. The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance. :Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences\\" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007 =Some legal considerations in the United States= There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation. Preemption The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programshttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&searchPath;=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&granuleId;=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI- subchapG&packageId;=CFR-2011-title40-vol25 Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles. They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices. Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out. They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential. Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control. States have police powers granted by the Constitution. They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances. California California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080 and New JerseyNJAC 7:29 have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not. One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigationArizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602 and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp. 823‚Äì14. Constitutional vagueness In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said Void for vagueness ‚ÄúIt is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect). In one case,State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005 the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term plainly audible provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that: #provide fair warning #avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. Overbreadth The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct. One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720 the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not constitutionally vague, gave fair warning, and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech. Nuisance Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private. A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. Black's Law Dictionary defines a nuisance as... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him. It defines a private nuisance as:..anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another. As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public. The word nuisance is connected closely with the word disturbance which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to noise disturbance. Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact. Enforceability Care must be taken in writing a subjective noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an objective noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable. For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40 dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30 dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge Confiscation Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices. Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual's property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices. =Four types of noise regulation= Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources. In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not. Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer. With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions. Subjective Emission These regulations allow an official to decide if the output of a sound source is acceptable without recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with plainly audible terms on public property as a criterion are examples. Subjective Immission These regulations allow an official to decide if the sound received by a listener is acceptable without recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source. Regulations with plainly audible or noise disturbance terms on private property as a criterion are examples. Objective Emission These regulations require an official to measure the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples. Objective Immission These regulations require an official to measure the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable without regard to the specific sound power generated by the source. Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples =Some definitions used in the United States= Many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level measurements. Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here. Engine braking device A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed. When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor. Muffler Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas. A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment. Noise disturbance Any sound or vibration which: # may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or; # causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or; # endangers or injures people or; # endangers or injures personal or real property. This can also be defined as noise nuisance. Place of public entertainment Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes. For this purpose, ‚Äúpublic‚Äù means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees. Plainly audible sound Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device. Powered model vehicle Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket. Real property boundary An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions. Sound reproduction device Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound. Vibration perception threshold The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things. =Ordinance provisions for stationary sources in the United States= there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective immission control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective immission control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation. The concept that a potential violator should have fair warning that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems. The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances. Air conditioning, heating and pool equipment This provision is a subjective immission control. An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums. Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact. Airport and airport operations Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds not related to flight operations. The community is able to control the land use around the airport however. Animals This provision is a subjective immission control. Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them. New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes. They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption. Authorized outdoor discharge of firearms and shooting ranges This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance. It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired. The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am. It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale. Condominiums and apartments This provision is a subjective immission control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official. One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of plainly audible but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance. However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55 dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5 dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance. In New York City specifically, the neighbor-to-neighbor noise issue is predominantly based on the average living situation. Due to the fact that most residents either live above, below, or directly next to their neighbors NYC building codes require the \\"acoustical isolation of dwelling units.\\" Through the use of thick concrete walls or flooring to make sure the condo or cooperative is able to pass a warranty of habitability each unit must be able to withstand a certain amount of noise.https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202759513592/The-Sound-and- the-Fury-Noise-in-Rentals-Coops-and-Condos/?mcode=1202614952687&curindex;=2 Construction This provision can be both a subjective immission control and an objective emission control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews. The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community. The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines. There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926. Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4) permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88 dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays. Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90 dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80 dB during the day for three days. Domestic and commercial power tools This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones. Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate outdoor and indoor use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools. Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions. Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II ‚Äì 27.201) exempts snow removal tools. Explosives, firearms, impulsive sources, and similar devices This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100 dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80 dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am. Fracking operations Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it. Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery. A subjective immission control or an objective immission control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels. Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way. The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban. Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking. Funerals This is a subjective emission control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings. It makes use of the plainly audible term and so adds a distance criterion. There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans. This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise. They failed to use ‚Äúplainly audible‚Äù which is narrower than ‚Äúaudible‚Äù. Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet. Loading and unloading operations This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am. Maximum permissible sound pressure levels This provision is an objective immission control. It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision: # It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. # It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq). # It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55 dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5 dB(A) above the ambient. # It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A). # It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial. # It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends. # It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive. # It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities. Most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am). Appendix A San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods: Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions. Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays. Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5 dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10 dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour. Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but presumed ambient. New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour. Atlanta, GA () limits impulsive sound to 100 dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5 dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds. Motor vehicle or motorboat repairs and testing This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways. The first is application of the noise disturbance provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am. The second is being plainly audible at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am. The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5 dB. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a noise disturbance at any time. Noise disturbance prohibited This provision is a subjective immission control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement. The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give fair warning, may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener. Noise sensitive zones This provision is a subjective immission control. It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations. To provide fair warning visible signs must be posted. It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt. Places of public entertainment This provision is an objective immission control. It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound. It can regulate the sound levels received by involuntary listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by voluntary listeners. If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95 dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is plainly audible within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55 dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65 dB(A). If outdoors, the limit is conversational level at 100 feet from the property line. If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84 dB(A)! Both of Chicago's limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am. Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95 dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100 dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE [sic] MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE. Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90 dB(A). Powered unmanned vehicles or engines This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property. It applies to airborne, water- borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles. It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles. it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields. The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties. Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the plainly audible criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source. Propane cannons This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops. In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon. The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon. Many US states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation. Florida stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits. They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise. British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use. Public address systems This provision is a subjective immission control. It can contain a plainly audible term or a curfew. It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to deliberately propagate mostly speech, but also music. Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject. Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used plainly audible as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am. Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60 dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50 dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities. Sound reproduction devices This provision is subjective immission control. It may contain a numerical level or a plainly audible term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to amplified sound sources. Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc. Changing the title to the above addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices. Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use plainly audible as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4) Stadiums and outdoor music festivals This provision can be either a subjective or objective immission control with a curfew. The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community. The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community. Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101) has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80 dB(A) at residential locations. Stationary emergency signaling devices This provision is an emission control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary. Stationary non-emergency non-safety signaling devices This provision is an emission control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of- week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt. Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5 dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as plainly audible restrictions at night. Street sales This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a ‚Äúdisturbance of the peace‚Äù. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am. Tampering This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers. Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving. Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels. See Section below on Adequate Mufflers. Vibration This provision is a subjective emission control. Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms. One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement. Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold. Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method. Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration. Maryland uses the definition of noise to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies. Wind turbines The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers. Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. \\"Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise\\", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006 Most local control is done by advantageous site planning. New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55 dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.Anon, \\"Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines\\", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009 =Ordinance provisions for moving vehicles in the United States= Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore immission controls are appropriate. Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so emission controls are appropriate. There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance. These must be treated by specific provisions. Adequate mufflers or sound dissipation devices This provision is an objective emission control. Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles. It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured. It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards. Many states have requirements that a muffler shall be in good working order which is not specific enough. California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement. Airboats and hovercraft This provision is both an \\"objective emission control and a subjective immission control. It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew. It can be based on noise disturbance in the community. It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact. Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A). Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test Engine braking devices This provision is an emission control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas. It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment. Common terminology is Jake brakes after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence. Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers. Motorboats This provision is both an objective emission control and a subjective immission control. Because they are moving sources, objective controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways. Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas. In this case, immission controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require immission measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require emission measurements to be made at 50 feet. Motor vehicle horns or signaling devices This provision is both a prohibition and an emission control. it limits to use for safety warning only.. It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance. This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or Rumbler or Howler horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency Motor vehicles on a public right-of-way This provision is an objective emission control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds. It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet). This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce. It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way. The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205). Most states and many cities have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply. Appendix B The most common speed division is 35 mph. Motor vehicle racing events This provision is an objective emission control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level. It can have a curfew. Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution. Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14 dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115 dB(A), and no more than 105 dB(A) at 50 feet. Motor vehicle sound systems This provision is both an objective emission control, a subjective emission control, and a subjective immission for vehicles on a public right- of-way. The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the plainly audible definition for limiting the sound output. The third part uses the noise disturbance definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants. There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle. Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle. Oregon prohibits sound systems being plainly audible at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be heard at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level. In Lakewood, CO it must not be plainly audible beyond 25 feet. In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet. In Seattle, WA, it must not be plainly audible at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than clearly audible at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts plainly audible to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits. Cincinnati, OH restricts plainly audible to 50 feet. Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations. Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet. Hammond, IN restricts plainly audible to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be plainly audible at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not plainly audible at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am. Florida states the sound must not be plainly audible at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems. Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be plainly audible beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise. Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is plainly audible on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet. Motor vehicle theft alarms This provision is a subjective emission control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes. New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number. Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes. Other states and communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes. Some communities have banned such alarms. Motor vehicle tire squeal and street drag racing This provision is a subjective immission control. It is based on the noise disturbance from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way. Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a noise disturbance. Railroads Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound. The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a quiet zone where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed. Recreational off-road vehicles This provision is both an objective emission control and a subjective immission control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties. Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an objective control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate. Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a subjective control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have emission controls measured at 50 feet; the most common level is 82 dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way. Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use. Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am. They prohibit any noise disturbance and require sound levels to the less than 96 dB(A) at 50 feet. Recreational snowmobiles This provision is both an objective emission control and a subjective immission control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties. Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an objective control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate. Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a subjective control is appropriate. Numerous states and communities have objective controls; the most common maximum level is 78 dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78 dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78 dB(A). Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events. Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also. Refuse collection vehicles This provision is an objective emission control and a subjective control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation. It can set a curfew, or it can be based on noise disturbance in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am. Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55 dB(A)] in residential zones at night. Note in some areas garbage trucks themselves play music to let residents know it is time to bring out their garbage. Standing motor vehicles This provision is a subjective immission control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a noise disturbance if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes. Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum. They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes. Building codes In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design. The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 dB). The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners. A special case of building skin design arises in the case of aircraft noise, where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit. Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants. The second type of interior sound is called Impact Insulation Class (IIC) transmission. This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself. The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above. This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel. Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes. California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades. U.S. occupational safety regulations The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or personal protective equipment is required.U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. \\"Occupational noise exposure.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html See also * A-weighting scale regarding the unit normally used in noise regulation * Aircraft noise for a broader discussion of aircraft noise regulation * Loud music * Buy Quiet General: *Health effects from noise *Occupational hearing loss *Environmental noise *Noise pollution *Noise control References External links * U.S. EPA - Noise Pollution - General information and resources *Airport Noise Law - U.S. *Directory of US and Canadian Noise Ordinances * Noise Pollution Clearing House - U.S. *Acoustical Society of America *American Institute of Architects *National Council of Acoustical Consultants *Business & Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association *Rutgers Noise Technical Assistance Center *Got Noise?

It has a weekly press run of 700 copies, which are distributed every Wednesday to more than 60 locations across the Auraria Campus and select locations in downtown Denver. The paper is a tabloid style publication with sections for news, sports, opinions, features and music. It focuses on issues of interest and concern to students at Metro and the other colleges located on the Auraria Campus. The editorial direction and content of The Metropolitan are entirely student-run. The staff of The Metropolitan comprises MSU Denver students, most of whom work on a strictly volunteer basis. An editorial staff of about 10 students, including section editors, copy editors, photo editors and an editor-in-chief direct a larger staff of about 10-15 reporters, photographers, columnists and artists. The Metropolitan is supported through advertising revenue, although it does receive funding through student fees. The Metropolitan is produced in the Office of Student Media, which also produces a literary and arts magazine, a news broadcast, a radio station and websites. The publications and broadcasts produced in the Office of Student media have won hundreds of awards from organizations such as the Society of Professional Journalists, Rocky Mountain Collegiate Press Association, and the Associated Collegiate Press. The Office of Student Media is run by a director and assistant director. History In 1979, staff from previous student publications, The Paper, Cherry Creek Pioneer and The Auraria Times joined together and started The Metropolitan. Emerson Schwartzkopf, and Steve Werges are credited for launching The Metropolitan, they were assisted by Frank X Mullen, Sal Ruibal, and S. Peter Duray-Bito, Metropolitan State University of Denver‚Äôs current student newspaper. The original newspaper offices were located in the Plaza Building. After the renovations on the Tivoli Student Union were completed in 1994, The Metropolitan moved to its current office at the Tivoli for a larger working and production space. Since 1982, Kate Lutrey, Carson Reed, Doug Conarroe, Doug Bell, Kenn Bisio, Dianne Harrison-Miller and Steve Haigh have all at one time held the Director of Student Media position. A major point in history for The Metropolitan occurred in 1992 when Editor Shawn Christopher Cox requested the names of the candidates running for the Dean of Letters, Arts and Sciences position. A six-week battle ensued between The Metropolitan staff who wanted to release those names to the public and members of the search committee, including Jodi Wetzel, who would not give up the information. Finally, in December 1992, Cox obtained the names of the three candidates and printed them in the Dec. 4 issue of The Metropolitan. This remains an important time in The Metropolitan‚Äôs history since the requested information was and still is public record, but there continues to be debate over whether names of Metro candidates should be released on the basis for the candidate‚Äôs privacy. Awards In 2006, The Metropolitan won the award for Best All-Around Non- Daily Student Newspaper from the Society of Professional Journalists. The staff that year also received two winning photography awards from SPJ. In 2009, under the leadership of editor-in-chief James Kruger and managing editor Nic Garcia, the paper was a finalist for the national Pacemaker award. The paper ranked in the top 25. More than 400 non-daily campus newspapers entered the contest. In 2011, two photographers from The Metropolitan photo staff won national Mark of Excellence awards from the Society of Professional Journalists: Sean Mullins placed first in the Breaking News Photography category and Drew Jaynes placed as a finalist in General News Photography. In 2012, student photographer Rachel Fuenzalida won first place in the General News Photography category of the national Mark of Excellence awards. Office of Student Media The Met Report ‚Äî Student television station and Internet Broadcasting The Met Report is an Emmy award-winning newscast at Metropolitan State College of Denver. In 2000, the Met Report was founded by Metro students Tom Livingston, Krystal Tweeddale, and Alex Brancard. The Met Report‚Äôs mission is to cover breaking news throughout the Auraria Campus that interest Metro State students. Every Friday at 12:30 p.m. the Met Report‚Äôs newscast produces a 30-minute news segment, which can be viewed on the Internet, on campus channel 20, or on Comcast cable channel 54 in Denver County. In 2005, the Met Report was awarded the Heartland Regional Emmy Award for Student Achievements and the National CBI award. In 2004, the Met Report was winner of the SPJ National Mark of Excellence Awards for Best All Around Online Student Broadcast, and was a station finalist for Television Non-Daily Newscast. The Met Report was also awarded in 2004 the SPJ Region 9 Mark of Excellence Awards. The SPJ Region 9 Mark of Excellence Awards includes five first place awards for Television Non-Daily Newscast, Best All-Around Online Student Broadcast Station, Television General News Reporting, Television Sports Photography, and Television In-Depth Reporting, and also two second place awards for Television Sports Reporting and Television Feature. In 2003, the Met Report was nominated for an Emmy in Student Achievements and received first place for Best All-Around Student Broadcast Station at the SPJ National Mark of Excellence Awards. The Met Report was awarded an additional two first place awards for Television Non-Daily Newscast and Best All-Around Online Student Broadcast Station, a second place award for Television Sports Photography, and two third place awards for Television Sports Reporting and TV Feature Photography at the 2003 SPJ Region 9 Mark of Excellence Awards. The Met Report‚Äôs won their first award, second place for Television Non-Daily Newscast, at the 2002 SPJ Region 9 Mark of Excellence Awards. KMet Radio ‚Äî Student Radio Broadcasting Met Radio is a student-directed, Internet radio station at Metropolitan State College of Denver. Jazz, rap, hip-hop, alternative, rock music and news could be listened to daily on www.kmetradio.org. Met Radio was created about 3 or 4 years ago by a group of Metro students who desired to spread interest in music and radio throughout the Auraria Campus. Met Radio started as a club and has disbanded. However, Met Radio is still transforming itself with the assistance the Office of Student Media. In the spring of 2006, Met Radio and the Met Report teamed up to broadcast Metro State basketball games live on the Internet. Met Online ‚Äî Online Student Journalism Met Online is the web version of The Metropolitan, the weekly student-run newspaper of Metropolitan State College of Denver. The Met Online offers in-depth and breaking news stories, photo essays and exclusive online content. It won the Best Affiliated Web site category for SPJ region 9 in 2006 (Web Editor Joe Nguyen) and 2009 (Web Editor Drew Jaynes). Metrosphere ‚Äî Student Literary and Art Magazine The \\"Metrosphere\\" is a collection visual art and literature created and edited by Metro students. Each fall the Office of Student Media selects an editor to direct a campus search for unique literary and visual art pieces. Flyers are put up, ads are placed in publications, and students are asks to submit their best works. Deadline for submissions is December. The editor and staff of the \\"Metrosphere\\" put together a magazine consisting of the best submissions. Each spring the \\"Metrosphere\\" magazine is distributed to students across campus at big events. In 2011, the Metrosphere won a Pacemaker Award in the literary (four-year) category.

It belongs to the family of hemotoxins, which destroy red blood cells or, as is the case with convulxin, induce blood coagulation. It causes platelet activation in the blood, forming clots and buildup of pressure. Convulxin acts as an agonist to the GPVI receptor, the major signalling receptor for collagen. This can cause the blood stream to burst, or the heart or brain to lose blood, thus resulting in death. It is a tetramer C-type lectin with an oligomeric structure, made up of heterodimeric subunits.  Family  Convulxin is part of the snake venom C-type lectin family, a group of hemorrhagic toxins that disrupt body homeostasis. The name describes their similarity in structure to C-type lectins from other animals, proteins that bind calcium to induce various signalling pathways. Proteins of about 130 amino acids in length, C-type lectins contain at least a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which mediates sugar and calcium binding. They are involved in various biological activities, ranging from cell-cell adhesion, serum glycoprotein turnover, to immune responses and cell apoptosis.  History  The toxin was first described in detail in 1969 by two Brazilian researchers from University of Campinas, J√∫lia Prado-Franceschi and Oswaldo Vital-Brazil. The snake C-type lectin convulxin was reported to activate platelets in a similar way to collagen in the late 1970s, but this was only announced after the discovery of the association with the FcR Œ≥-chain and after it was recognized to mediate activation through GPVI. Now this toxin is widely used to study mammalian platelet receptors.  Structure  Convulxin is a heterodimer made up of Œ±-(13.9 kDa) and Œ≤- (12.6 kDa) subunits, with 38% sequence identity and homologous structures. The subunits are connected by disulfide bridges to form a cyclic, ring-like Œ±4Œ≤4 structure . Its function arises from its ability to bind with high affinity to the platelet receptor for collagen, glycoprotein (GP) VI. It is, therefore, an important task to determine the binding site on the heterodimer to the GPVI. The heterodimer structure presents a concave surface, predicted to be the ligand binding site. Furthermore, general research into the C-type lectin family describes the binding site as being formed by loop regions, falling between the second Œ±-helix and the second Œ≤-strand on both the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits. Investigating the particular sequences of these structures showed high variability, suggesting that it is indeed these variable, concave loops that offer specificity in ligand binding. Analysis on the specific Cvx structure has revealed 3 possible sites of interaction with GPVI. Firstly, two adjacent patches of positive and negative charge on the Œ±-subunit; secondly, a cavity in the same subunit lines with the following residues:Trp23, Ser67, Leu104, Ala117, Gly121 and Ile123; finally, a negatively charged patch on the Œ≤-subunit.  Mechanism of action  Normally, upon injury to the endothelium, collagen mediated GPVI signalling increases platelet formation by thromboxane A2, therefore creating a blood clot. In case of blood vessel damage, collagen on the extracellular matrix is exposed. As platelets interact with it, an activation signal is sent for aggregation. Platelets interact indirectly with collagen, via the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which connects the collage to the platelet GPIb receptor, forcing them close to the site of vessel damage. There, they can interact with receptors on the extracellular matrix, which stimulate adhesion through integrins (heterodimer Œ±2Œ≤1), and downstream signalling. GPVI is present as a complex with the Fc receptor (FcR) Œ≥-chain, which gets phosphorylated by SYK as a result of activation by a stimulus. This generates a downstream signal, leading to platelet activation. While this is important in case of injury, inappropriate activation of platelets can lead to the formation of clots within the circulation. Such is the case with Convulxin, which can induce a signalling cascade similar to that of collagen. Due to its high affinity, convulxin bind to GPVI and causes clustering of the glycoproteins. Research has proved that GPlb is not involved in convulxin- induced activation, but that the p62/GPVI collagen receptor is the unique binding site, and protein phosphorylation happens more rapidly and more intensely than in the case of collagen. Furthermore, denatured samples of the toxin containing Œ±, Œ≤, or both subunits have been shown not to induce platelet aggregation or tyrosine phosphorylation suggesting that pellet formation requires the native conformation of the protein. However, reduced convulxin subunits still inhibit the effect of collagen since they bind to a common receptor necessary for collagen activation of platelets. . The free toxin might be evacuated through opsonization via the reticuloendothelial system (for the most part the liver and kidneys) or it might degrade through the lysosomes. Therefore, Convulxin acts as an agonist to collagen, inducing platelet activation via GPVI binding, ultimately causing blood clots accumulation in the absence of a homeostatic signal.  Toxicity  Studies carried out on the toxicity of convulxin show that symptoms are a function of the dose. The effects of the toxin stand out through the sudden and brief duration of the symptoms after exposure. In mice, low doses (5 Œºg/animal) administered intravenously (I.V) elicited tachypnea, followed by apnea, within 20 seconds. The ED50 for brief duration apnea was determined to be 180 Œºg/kg. Higher doses (10 Œºg/animal) evoked intense convulsive crisis, and usually ended with the death of the animal. LD50 was determined to be 524 Œºg/kg. Intraperitoneal (I.P.) administration of up to 200 Œºg/animal proved to be ineffective. In cats, I.V. injections of 100 Œºg/kg showed respiratory disturbances, miosis, salivation, abdominal cramps, nystagmus, loss of equilibrium, convulsions and sometimes a brief phase of hypotonia. The ED50 dose for convulsions is 80 Œºg/kg. The majority of animals recovered within 30 minutes. In dogs, the effect of convulxin showed two stages. After I.V. injection of 100-125 Œºg/kg they became excited, barked and exhibited loss of equilibrium, respiratory disturbances, nystagmus, urination, defecation and vomiting. After recovery, two out of five animals had intermittent crisis of clonic convulsions that appeared after 24 hours and lasted until their death. The other three dogs showed periods of vivid agitation alternating with torpor. While the lethal dose in humans is not yet known, what has been discovered is that the level of toxic effects depends on the origin of the snake. As for a cure, so far a polyvalent snake antivenom is being used.

Most syndicated shows come from the Westwood One Network, although a few shows are syndicated by the Salem Radio Network and Fox News Radio. Most hours begin with world and national news from ABC News Radio. History =Early Years= On December 3, 1961, WEEE first signed on as a 5,000-watt daytimer radio station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1964 page B-106 The 1300 kHz frequency allocation was created for another station that was forced off the air a year earlier, 1280 WRSA in nearby Saratoga Springs. WEEE played country music, but always had trouble competing against more powerful and popular WOKO (now WOPG), the leading country station in the market. In 1970, WEEE was bought by People Communication and became WQBK, initially switching to a Top 40 sound, then trying a middle of the road. On December 1, 1972, an FM sister station signed on, WQBK-FM at 103.9 MHz, which mostly simulcasted AM 1300, allowing listeners to hear WQBK day and night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1974 B-146 But after several years, People Communication decided to give the FM station its own separate format, progressive rock. =Switch to Talk Radio= With the FM station doing its own format, People Communication moved WQBK to a full-time talk station, using news from United Press International. Then, in 1981, WQBK became a full-time station with 5,000 watts of nighttime power. Now able to stay on the air after sunset, WQBK became the New York Yankees radio network affiliate for the Capital District. With the exception of upstart WWCN from 1985‚Äì1987, WQBK was the only full-time talk radio station in the Albany area until WGY and WPTR (later WDCD, now defunct) moved to that format in the late 1990s. WQBK was the first talk station for Tom Leykis early in his career before he left for Miami. Also, market veterans Paul Vandenburgh (later of WROW, and current morning host at WGDJ) and Tom Mailey (who went on to WRGB) began their careers at the station. The talk format did well even against the larger signaled WPTR and the evolution of WGY to talk. In 1996, WQBK-AM-FM were sold to Radio Enterprises, Inc., leading to drastic changes for cost savings. All local programming was quickly canceled, many of the staff fired, and sports contracts were terminated including the Yankees, hours before the first pitch of opening day. The new WQBK ran mostly syndicated programming from ABC Talk Radio and NBC Talknet, using hourly newscasts from CBS Radio News.Broadcasting Yearbook 1997 page B-312 =Becoming a Sports Station= In 1997, Radio Enterprises was purchased by Clear Channel Communications (which had owned a minority share). Noticing a steady performance by New York City sports radio pioneer WFAN, even in the Albany ratings 150 miles to the north, management decided to flip WQBK to become the first all-sports station in the market. The station took the call sign WTMM (referring to \\"Team\\") and began to acquire a number of play-by-play rights for regional sports teams. In the first year of its new format, much of WTMM's programming came from One-on-One Sports. In early 1998, WTMM became an affiliate of ESPN Radio. With the station's launch came the addition of play-by-play of Buffalo Bills football, Albany Firebirds arena football, College of Saint Rose athletics, and Union College men's hockey. The station's biggest acquisition came in 2000 when the station returned to broadcasting New York Yankees baseball games, a fixture on the station during its time as WQBK. Later that year, Regent Communications purchased the station after Clear Channel divested several stations in the market and decided to launch its own sports talk station, WOFX. Regent made budget cuts, eliminating most of WTMM's non-ESPN programming including the \\"Albany Times Union Sports Minute\\" and all locally based play-by play. The station also lost its own sales staff, leading to commercial breaks being filled with public service announcements and ads sold on group deals. Some exceptions came when WTMM and sister station WABT aired Albany Conquest arena football games in 2004 and when the American Hockey League's Albany River Rats began airing their games on WTMM in 2006. =Female Talk as WEEV= Regent's moved a new FM station on 105.7 MHz into the Albany market, sparking a realignment of its stations. With the new signal taking WABT's format, WTMM's all-sports format was moved to WABT's former home at 104.5 MHz. Prior to this move, Regent entered a deal with Greenstone Media to air that company's female-targeted talk radio programs, and in January 2007 the station became WEEV, Eve 1300 AM. However, Greenstone Media went out of business that August, and the station reverted to the WTMM call letters as an AM simulcast of WTMM- FM. =Change to WGDJ Talk Radio= During 2007, Regent Communications began selling many of their smaller market and lower priority stations. Having lost its audience due to the Eve experiment, Regent decided to sell WTMM to locally based startup company Capital Broadcasting, Inc., with former WQBK host Paul Vandenburgh serving as its president and general manager. The price was $850,000.00. On November 26, 2007, 1300's Capital Broadcasting took control of the station from Regent and rolled out a talk radio format similar to the old WQBK, emphasizing local shows over nationally syndicated hosts. Capital Broadcasting initially announced the new call letters for the station would be WCBI. However, Capital Broadcasting was unable to secure permission from Morris Multimedia, owner of WCBI-TV in Columbus, Mississippi, to share the WCBI call sign, and on February 14, 2008, the station instead changed its call letters to WGDJ. The call sign's origins are disputed. Claims have been made to it being the initials of former Albany Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who had a regularly scheduled program on the station. However, sources at the station say it is actually the initials of the owner's children. In November 2009, WGDJ boosted its power to 10,000 watts in the daytime and 8,000 watts at night. Also in 2009, Siena College began broadcasting its men's basketball games on WGDJ. On February 7, 2013, WGDJ announced that former House of Representatives member John E. Sweeney would host a show on the station. Sweeney would quit the show two weeks later, citing schedule conflicts.Karlin, Rick. Sweeney‚Äôs short-lived radio show. Times Union.

Written by Blackie Lawless, the song was released as the band's first single. Due to his religious beliefs, Lawless does not perform the song live anymore.http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID;=129597 In the United States, the song was first released in a live version in 1988. The studio version was available in that region only in 1998, on the reissue of W.A.S.P.'s debut album, which omitted the asterisks used to censor the title originally. History Recorded in early 1984, the debut single intended for the self-titled album of W.A.S.P. was close to not being released at all after being dropped from the album. Deemed too controversial, Capitol Records did not want to risk the album being banned from major retail chains. The record company had subsequent plans to release the single only in Europe, in a black plastic bag and with a warning sticker about the explicit lyrics. Capitol backed out at the last minute and the single was shelved until the band was able to strike a one-off publishing deal with the independent label Music For Nations. The single was finally released in April 1984, complete with the original sleeve and art depicting a codpiece and a circular saw blade. Story behind the lyrics According to a 1997 article that accompanied a reissue of W.A.S.P's debut album which features this track, the basis of the song, according to an article in Kerrang! Magazine was that Lawless had observed a photo of two lions mating in National Geographic Magazine. The Kerrang! article was penned by Assistant Editor Dante Bonutto, who had written the magazine's first cover feature on the band, originally published in April 1984.

As Imperial Foreign Minister Aehrenthal formulated and executed the formal and complete annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their integration into the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1908. With the annexation he sought to permanently block in the Balkan south of the Empire the emergence of inter- and intra-ethnic nationalisms amongst the multiplicity of peoples there on the basis of their shared religious beliefs and ethnic affiliations. His actions precipitated an international crisis because he sought to achieve his objectives by negotiation of Russian acceptance of the annexation in exchange for Austrian support for greater Russian access from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean through the Straits of the Dardanelles (at the expense of Ottoman Imperial interests), which Britain and France would supposedly accept since they had recently become allied with Imperial Russia. Aehrenthal, seeking to limit objections in Russia to any support for the annexation began secret negotiations with Russian foreign minister Alexander Izvolsky. The annexation ultimately damaged Austro-Russian collaboration on settling Balkan questions. Also, it stirred chauvinist popular emotion in Russia, which felt humiliated in a sphere of vital interest to it.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers, p 86 Fay, p. 394.  Origins  Born at Gro√ü Skal Castle in Bohemia (present-day Hrub√° Sk√°la, Czech Republic),Wank, Solomon (2009), In the twilight of empire: Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal (1854-1912), Volume 1: The Making of an Imperial Habsburg Patriot and Statesman), Bohlau. p. 27. he was the second- born son of Baron (Freiherr) Johann Lexa von Aehrenthal (1817‚Äì1898), a large- scale landowner in Gro√ü Skal and Doksany, and his wife Marie, n√©e Countess Thun und Hohenstein. His father was a powerful leader of the Constitutionally Loyal Large Landowners party in Bohemia.Wank, 2009 His great-grandfather Johann Anton Lexa (1733-1824), from a rural background in Kralovice, had founded an insurance company in Prague and was ennobled in 1790. There were false rumors that he had Jewish ancestors spread by his enemies.

He undoubtedly showed himself to be an able and ambitious diplomat, a cool negotiator, a wide-awake observer, a patient listener, a discreet talker endowed with great outward calm but with a lively and dominating imagination more passionate than clear sighted.Albertini, Vol. 1, pp. 190‚Äì91. Career With no great prospects of inheritance, Aehrenthal studied jurisprudence and politics at the University of Bonn and the Prague Charles University. He began his career in the diplomatic service of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as attach√© in Paris under Count Beust (1877). He went in 1878 in the same capacity to St. Petersburg, and from 1883 to 1888 he worked at the Foreign Office in Vienna under Count Gustav K√°lnoky, with whom he formed close relations. In 1888 he was sent as councillor of embassy to St. Petersburg, where he exercised considerable influence with the ambassador, Count Wolkenstein. Recalled in 1894 to service in the Foreign Office, he undertook important duties, and in the following year went to Bucharest as ambassador. Here he succeeded in strengthening the relations between the courts of Vienna and Bucharest, the secret alliance which King Charles had concluded in 1883 with the Central European Powers being renewed on 30 September. In 1899 he became ambassador in St. Petersburg, where he remained until his appointment as Foreign Minister in October 1906. Aehrenthal at this time thought that Austria-Hungary must, even at the cost of some sacrifice, come to an agreement with Russia. In this sense he endeavoured to continue the negotiations successfully begun by his predecessor, Prince Franz Liechtenstein, for the bridging over of the differences on Balkan questions between Vienna and St. Petersburg, in order to create a basis for a permanent friendly relation between Austria-Hungary and Russia. He played a principal part in concluding the M√ºrzsteg Agreement of 1903. During the Russo-Japanese War he took a strong line in favour of a benevolent attitude on the part of the Vienna Cabinet towards Russia. In October 1906, he replaced Count Goluchowski as minister of foreign affairs. He at first maintained the views which he had professed as ambassador. He was determined to preserve the interests of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans, but also showed himself prepared to meet the Russian wishes in the Dardanelles question. However, in the course of the Bosnian Crisis, he abandoned the idea of a friendly accommodation with the Russian Government. =Bosnian Crisis= The principal players in the Bosnian Crisis of 1908-09 were the foreign ministers of Austria and Russia, Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal and Alexander Izvolsky, respectively. Both were motivated by political ambition; the first would emerge successful, and the latter would be broken by the crisis. Along the way, they would drag Europe to the brink of war in 1909. They would also divide Europe into the armed camp that it would remain until 1914.Gooch, 1936, pp 366-438. Aehrenthal was thoroughly convinced that the Slavic minorities could never come together, and the Balkan League Would never accomplish any damage to Austria. 1912 he rejected an Ottoman proposal for an alliance that would include Austria, Turkey and Romania. His policies alienated the Bulgarians, who turned instead to Russia and Serbia. Although Austria had no intention to embark on additional expansion to the south, Aehrenthal encouraged speculation to that effect, expecting it would paralyze the Balkan states. Instead, it incited them to feverish activity to create a defensive block to stop Austria. A series of grave miscalculations at the highest level thus significantly strengthened Austria's enemies.F.R. Bridge, From Sadowa to Sarajevo: the foreign policy of Austria-Hungary, 1866-1914 (1972) pp 338-39. Under the Treaty of Berlin, the Dardanelles, controlled by Turkey, would not allow the passage of warships of any country to or from the Black Sea. This agreement bottled up a portion of the Russian Fleet that could have been well used at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese war four years earlier. Izvolsky wanted this changed to allow the passage of only Russian ships through the straits. This would give Russia a Mediterranean presence and, it was perceived, help her recover some face after the bitter defeat by Japan. Aehrenthal wanted full control of Bosnia-Herzogovina through annexation even though Austria-Hungary had administered the provinces since 1878. His reasons for this lay in the possible recovery of the \\"sick man of Europe\\", Turkey. The \\"Young Turk\\" revolution of 1908, led in part by Enver Pasha, convinced some that the Ottoman Empire might be on the rise again. Thus, Aehrenthal reasoned, it was now or maybe never. He would discuss this matter with Izvolsky to ensure the Russians would not interfere with the annexation plans. The two ministers held a meeting on 19 September 1908 at Buchlau Castle owned by Count Leopold von Berchtold, where they agreed on the following plan: Izvolsky would ignore the annexation and, in turn, Aehrenthal would back the opening of the Dardanelles to Russian warships. At the same time, Bulgaria would declare its independence from Turkey, and both would allow this. The Austrians would also give up some territory in the Balkans in Sand≈æak to keep Serbia quiet. The key to the plan was timing. Their plans would have to be announced simultaneously if the ploy was to be successful. For Aehrenthal, a German-Hungarian nobleman and staunch monarchist, there was a direct threat in the Pan-Slav emergent nationalism of the kind that a consolidated Yugo (south) Slav Confederation led by Serbia represented. The gradual consolidation of the Yugo-Slavs (in the name of the 'new centuries' idea of national self-determination for all ethnic/racial/religious groups) led by Serbia was a deadly threat to Aehrenthal‚Äôs Austria-Hungary. For Aehrenthal, Moravia, Bohemia, and Silesia were the crown lands of his Ost-Mark German nobility, which ruled over a host of emergent Slav and Pan-Slav ethnicities: Pole, Czech, Ruthenian, Slovakian, and Ukrainian. In Serbia‚Äôs consolidation of Bosnia-Herzegovina into herself, there was the clear roadmap to the dissolution of most of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. More importantly, this Pan-Slav self-determinant nationalism pointed the way to the loss of the defendable military, political, and economic boundaries of the Empire. Aehrenthal‚Äôs Hungarian noble half saw an equally strong threat with the loss of Hungary's historic Slavic provinces should Pan- Slav take root. It would equally threaten its military security and economic future. Aehrenthal moved quickly, faster than Izvolsky. He acted on 3 October 1908 under the premise that Austria-Hungary was taking control of Bosnia- Herzogovina so that the people there could enjoy the benefits of the empire as a reward for economic advancement since first being administered back in 1878. A seething Serbia could hardly believe this action and demanded Russian intervention. This left Izvolsky holding the bag. He announced his plans for the free passage of Russian warships though the Turkish straits but was shot down by every other signatory to the treaty, especially England. The British said they would consider opening up the straits to all warships but would not limit it to Russian ships alone. This is hardly what Izvolsky had in mind since this had the potential of letting belligerent ships into the Black Sea. Germany at first viewed the whole tangle with disdain, taking the Turkish side. The Kaiser had been working on strengthening relations with Turkey and, now with the chance of Ottoman recovery, he wished to stay this course. As the crisis continued, the Kaiser was forced from the diplomatic scene by the Daily Telegraph Affair and no longer was a major decision maker. Events reached a fever pitch when, in early November, the Serbian army mobilized. Germany now took the Austrian side stating it would stick by its ally. Russia, wishing to support Serbia, but not really ready for war with Germany and Austria was forced to back away when the Austrian threatened to publish the details of the agreement between Aehrenthal and Izvolsky and Germany sent a vaguely-worded threat to Izvolsky, stating they would \\"let things take their course.\\" The fact that she had betrayed her Slav ally beforehand was not a fact that Russia wished widely publicized. Izvolsky remained at his post for three more years but his reputation was ruined beyond repair. The Russians backed down and urged Serbia to do likewise, which she did and declared publicly that the annexation was none of her business. War was averted for the time being, but the results were a bitter Russia and an enraged Serbia. Russia vowed, if ever confronted in this manner again, that she would not back down - a vow that would be kept in a few years. Family In 1902, Aehrenthal married Pauline, Countess Sz√©ch√©nyi. Death In 1912, Aehrenthal suddenly died of leukemia.  See also  * Leopold Graf Berchtold  Footnotes   References  * Albertini, Luigi (1952). The Origins of the War of 1914: vol 1 , * Fay, Sidney B.

The book served as the basis for the first Shrek movie and the popular Shrek film series over a decade after its publication. Witchcraft in written fiction  Plot  Shrek is a repugnant, green- skinned, fire-breathing, seemingly indestructible monster who enjoys causing misery with his repulsiveness. After his parents decide that he has come of age, he is (literally) kicked out of their swamp. Shrek soon encounters a witch, who, in exchange for his rare specimens of lice, reads his fortune: using the magic words \\"Apple Strudel\\", he will meet a donkey who will take him to a castle, where he will battle a knight and marry a princess who is even uglier than he. Excitedly on his way, Shrek encounters a scything peasant from whom he steals and eats his pheasant, counters an attack from thunder, lightning and rain by eating lightning's fiercest bolt, and knocks out a dragon with his fiery breath. However, he is disturbed by a dream in which he is helpless to being hugged and kissed by a multitude of children. Awakening, he meets the donkey, who takes him to the Nutty Knight of Crazy Castle. The Knight is offended by Shrek's demands to enter the castle and attempts to smite him, to which Shrek responds with a fire blast that sends him into the moat. Upon entering the castle, Shrek is terrified when he appears to be surrounded by an army of similarly hideous creatures, but regains his resolve upon discovering that he is in the hall of mirrors. He finally meets the princess; mutually smitten by their shared ugliness, they marry and live \\"horribly ever after, scaring the socks off all who fell afoul of them\\".

However, around the time DreamWorks was founded, producer John H. Williams brought the book to DreamWorks, and co founder Jeffrey Katzenberg was interested in the concept. As a result, DreamWorks ended up acquiring the rights for the book in 1995, and Katzenberg quickly put the film in active development. Chris Farley was originally cast to voice the titular character, Steve Martin was cast to voice Donkey, and Janeane Garofalo was cast to voice Princess Fiona. After Farley's death in December 1997, the studio rewrote the script and cast Mike Myers to replace Farley and Eddie Murphy was casted as Donkey to replace Martin. Garofalo was fired for unknown reasons. Shrek was released on May 18, 2001, starring the voices of Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. The film was a critical and commercial success and won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was followed by three sequels: Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010) with a reboot currently in development.

It was funded by DARPA, but the project was shelved after the BigDog was deemed too loud for combat.  History of BigDog  Image from the DARPA Strategic Plan (2007) BigDog was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the hopes that it would be able to serve as a robotic pack mule to accompany soldiers in terrain too rough for conventional vehicles. Instead of wheels or treads, BigDog uses four legs for movement, allowing it to move across surfaces that would defeat wheels. The legs contain a variety of sensors, including joint position and ground contact. BigDog also features a laser gyroscope and a stereo vision system. BigDog is long, stands tall, and weighs , making it about the size of a small mule. It is capable of traversing difficult terrain, running at , carrying , and climbing a 35 degree incline. Locomotion is controlled by an onboard computer that receives input from the robot's various sensors. Navigation and balance are also managed by the control system. BigDog's walking pattern is controlled through four legs, each equipped with four low-friction hydraulic cylinder actuators that power the joints. BigDog's locomotion behaviors can vary greatly. It can stand up, sit down, walk with a crawling gait that lifts one leg at a time, walk with a trotting gait lifting diagonal legs, or trot with a running gait. Travel speed of BigDog varies from a crawl to a trot. The BigDog project was headed by Dr. Martin Buehler, who received the Joseph Engelberger Award from the Robotics Industries Association in 2012 for the work. Dr. Buehler while previously a professor at McGill University, headed the robotics lab there, developing four-legged walking and running robots. Built onto the actuators are sensors for joint position and force, and movement is ultimately controlled through an onboard computer which manages the sensors. Approximately 50 sensors are located on BigDog. These measure the attitude and acceleration of the body, motion, and force of joint actuators as well as engine speed, temperature and hydraulic pressure inside the robot's internal engine. Low-level control, such as position and force of the joints, and high-level control such as velocity and altitude during locomotion, are both controlled through the onboard computer. BigDog was featured in episodes of Web Junk 20 and Hungry Beast, and in articles in New Scientist, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, and The Wall Street Journal. On March 23, 2008, Boston Dynamics released video footage of a new generation of BigDog known as AlphaDog.DARPA‚ÄôS LS3 AlphaDog begins outdoor testing The footage shows BigDog's ability to walk on icy terrain and recover its balance when kicked from the side.Video of BigDog in action from Boston Dynamics The refined equivalent has been designed by Boston Dynamics to exceed the BigDog in terms of capabilities and use to dismounted soldiers. In February 2012, with further DARPA support, the militarized Legged Squad Support System (LS3) variant of BigDog demonstrated its capabilities during a hike over tough terrain. Starting in the summer of 2012, DARPA planned to complete the overall development of the system and refine its key capabilities in 18 months, ensuring its worth to dismounted warfighters before it is rolled out to squads operating in-theatre. BigDog must be able to demonstrate its ability to complete a trek in 24 hours, without refuelling, while carrying a load. A refinement of its vision sensors will also be conducted. At the end of February 2013, Boston Dynamics released video footage of a modified BigDog with an arm. The arm can pick up objects and throw them. The robot is relying on its legs and torso to help power the motions of the arm. It is believed that it can lift weights around .\\"BigDog Throws Cinder Blocks with Huge Robotic Face-Arm\\" IEEE Spectrum, 28 February 2013. =Discontinuation= At the end of December 2015, the BigDog project was discontinued.

Hardware  BigDog is powered by a two- stroke, one-cylinder, go-kart engine operating at over 9,000 RPM. The engine drives a hydraulic pump, which in turn drives the hydraulic leg actuators. Each leg has four actuators (two for the hip joint, and one each for the knee and ankle joints), for a total of 16. Each actuator unit consists of a hydraulic cylinder, servo valve, position sensor, and force sensor.

Alfonso, also called Anfuso or Anfusus (c. 1120 ‚Äì 10 October 1144), was the Prince of Capua from 1135 and Duke of Naples from 1139. He was an Italian-born Norman of the noble Hauteville family. After 1130, when his father Roger became King of Sicily, he was the third in line to the throne; second in line after the death of an older brother in 1138. He was the first Hauteville prince of Capua after his father conquered the principality from the rival Norman Drengot family. He was also the first Norman duke of Naples after the duchy fell vacant on the death of the last Greek duke. He also expanded his family's power northwards, claiming lands also claimed by the Papacy, although he was technically a vassal of the Pope for his principality of Capua. Early life Alfonso was the third son of Count Roger II of Sicily, who became king in 1130, and his first wife, Elvira of Castile. He was probably named after his maternal grandfather, King Alfonso VI of Castile, but contemporary sources invariably use the spellings Anfusus, Anphusus or Amphusus. According to Alexander of Telese, in August 1135 Alfonso was a mere \\"boy\\" (puer) too young to be knighted alongside his brothers Roger (died 1148) and Tancred (died 1138). While the Latin term puer might refer to a man up to the age of 28, Alfonso was less than sixteen years old, the age at which a boy was knighted in medieval Sicily. He was also older than two other brothers, William and Henry, described as infantes (infants), that is, under fourteen. Alfonso's birth therefore took place around 1120. After the refusal of Prince Robert II of Capua to submit to King Roger in June 1135, Roger declared him deposed and in October appointed Alfonso to the principality, \\"with the support of all the best knights\\". To underline the royal authority, Roger and his sons made a solemn entry into Capua and had the principality's vassals swear fealty to their new prince and to their king and his heir. In this way, the traditional principalities of southern Italy nominally retained their autonomy, but as integral parts of the kingdom, royal appanages. Roger's chancellor Guarin, who had administered Capua on behalf of Roger since royal troops had occupied it in 1134, continued to administer on behalf of the young Alfonso. After Guarin, Robert of Selby was appointed to administer Capua until Alfonso came of age. He was still governing there during the imperial invasion of 1137, when the army of the German emperor Lothair II briefly occupied Capua and reinstated Prince Robert. Administration of Capua and Naples On 25 July 1139, in a meeting at Mignano, Pope Innocent II finally recognised Roger as King of Sicily, in exchange Roger accepted Innocent as his feudal lord. The pope also recognised Alfonso as Prince of Capua and invested him with a banner. Although the granting of a banner implied that Capua was a direct fief of the papacy, in fact it was an arri√®re-fief. Alfonso was a vassal of his father, who was a vassal of the pope. Nonetheless, after receiving his papal investiture Alfonso took personal charge of his principality. In 1137, Duke Sergius VII of Naples died and his duchy fell vacant. In 1139, the Neapolitans made their submission to King Roger at Benevento on papal territory. The contemporary historian Falco of Benevento records how \\"in those days the citizens of Naples came to Benevento, and bringing the city of Naples to the fealty of the Lord King they took his son [to be their] duke, and submitted their necks to his [Alfonso's] fealty.\\" This took place in July 1139. The acquisition of Naples and the papal banner occurred around the same time, and Alfonso thus became the ruler of two small principalities at about the age of nineteen. Alfonso did not initially control the revenues of his principality, which were overseen by a royal chamberlain, Jocelin. It is also unclear what judicial authority he exercised. His principality corresponded to a single circuit of royal justiciars, the later Terra di Lavoro. The original justiciars, Archbishop-elect William of Capua and Lord Hamo of Arienzo, were appointed in 1135. Later evidence from the reign of King Tancred, suggests that the prince of Capua had supreme judicial authority in his province. Alfonso was only intermittently resident in Capua, and he often visited Sicily. On the whole, his office appears to have been primarily a military one, and he acted more as a representative of the royal power than as the prince of an old and well-defined country. He initially bore the Latin title princeps Capue, but after acquiring Naples he used the longer title princeps Capuanorum et dux Neapolitanorum, \\"Prince of the Capuans and Duke of the Neapolitans\\". At Capua he minted copper follari in the style of the old princes but much smaller in size. Six types are known, some bearing the inscription AN (for Anfusus) or A P (for Anfusus princeps) and some even with Pseudo-Kufic inscriptions. He had his own court and his own officials, who dated charters by the years of his reign. Perhaps because of the independent-mindedness of the Capuan barons, Alfonso's government in Capua was more formally organised than that of his brother Roger in Apulia. Sometime after 1135, probably towards 1140, Duke Richard III of Gaeta was compelled to swear homage to King Roger, Duke Roger and Prince Alfonso. Wars in the north In March 1140, acting on his father's orders, Alfonso commenced the conquest of the Abruzzo, which belonged to the Duchy of Spoleto, part of the kingdom of Italy. Shortly after he was joined by his brother Roger. They took the strategic fortresses of Arce and Sora, and extended the kingdom over all the territory from the river Pescara to the Tronto. The chronicler Falco of Benevento records that they took many castles and settlements, burned others and left with great spoils. The king then joined his sons and, on 28 April 1140, Alfonso witnessed the king's charter by which he founded the Cappella Palatina in Palermo. By July 1140 the frontier of the kingdom had been pushed north as far as Ceprano in the papal state. According to the Chronica Ferrariensis, when Pope Innocent wrote to Alfonso demanding that he cease invading his lands, he wrote back that \\"he would not seek another's lands, but wanted only to reintegrate lands belonging to his Capuan principality, and so subjugate all the lands of the principality of Capua and the duchy of Apulia to himself.\\" In July 1142, the king and Alfonso held a great court at Silva Marca near Ariano, attended by all the counts of the mainland. Alfonso then invaded the papal territory of Marsia, which Alfonso claimed belonged to the princes of Capua, although they had no exercised power there since the reign of Prince Richard I in the 1070s. Alfonso also intervened in a dispute within the family of the counts of Teramo. He removed Count Matthew and replaced him with his brothers, William and Robert. In November 1143 the conquest of Marsia was completed and its feudal lords accepted the authority of the King of Sicily. All the conquered territories in the Abruzzo and Latium were then divided by the between Apulia and Capua, Alfonso taking the lands to the west of the Gran Sasso d'Italia. At Ceprano in early June 1144, King Roger and Alfonso opened negotiations with Pope Lucius II, who demanded the restoration of the Principality of Capua as a full papal fief. After fifteen days, the negotiations were broken off. The king left to prepare a naval expedition, while Alfonso invaded the papal state, taking the towns of Rieti and Amiterno. Lucius quickly agreed to a seven-year truce with Alfonso, but Roger refused to ratify it. The prince of Capua died on 10 October 1144, probably in the course of this campaign. Roger signed a treaty with Lucius shortly after, relinquishing Alfonso's most recent conquests. Alfonso was succeeded at Capua and Naples by his younger brother William, and the government of Capua was again entrusted to Robert of Selby. An elegy for an unnamed \\"son of Roger the Frank, lord of Sicily\\" by the Sicilian poet Ab≈´ l-·∏åaw æ was about either Alfonso or his older brother Tancred.

Because Polish family names have different forms for genders and plural, Gosiewska is the same form for a female family member. History It seems the Gosiewski family (or GƒÖsiewski in old times), originates from a Knight from the ≈ölepowron heraldic clan, Lord of Gosie or Gosiewo, near R√≥≈ºan. Their estate had an area of about 9 km¬≤, and contained villages: Modzele, Ogony, part of M≈Çynarze (Mlynarze) village between the road and Narew River, part of Kruszewo village (south part of village and terrains up to Che≈Çsty or Chelsty). Generally the estate contained quite big terrain from Che≈Çsty to R√≥≈ºan. After they became also owner of a part of a village Mroczki-Kawki Many Gosiewskis still live in Che≈Çsty and the surrounding area. Two of the most representative members of the family were Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski, Palatine-Governor of Smolensk, Speaker of the Parliament and commander of the Polish garrison of the Moscow Kremlin. His son Lithuanian Field Commander Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski was a supporter of a strong and centralized royal power, limiting Liberum veto and a variation about how the King should be elect call Vivente rege. They were two of the most powerful and influential officers in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the 17th century. Coat of arms This Gosiewski family used the ≈ölepowron coat of arms. There are three other Gosiewski families entitled to use Korwin, Jastrzƒôbiec coats of arms and a derivative arms named Gosiewski, according to Tadeusz Gajl's armorial.

Shrek is the protagonist of the book of the same name, a series of films by DreamWorks Animation, as well as a musical. The name \\"Shrek\\" is derived from the German word Schreck, meaning \\"fright\\" or \\"terror\\". In the films, Shrek was voiced by Mike Myers, and in the musical he was played principally by Brian d'Arcy James. On May 21, 2010, Shrek received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named him one of the \\"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\\", placing 15th. Fictional biography Shrek is a gigantic, green-skinned, physically intimidating ogre with a Scottish accent, however in Shrek Forever After it is revealed that he is much smaller than the average ogre. Even though his background is something of a mystery, according to Shrek The Musical, it is revealed that on his 7th birthday, Shrek was sent away by his parents because it was an ogre tradition. He is seen traveling alone, being either screamed at or teased by passers-by. The only time he receives a pleasant greeting is a wave from a young Fiona, who is promptly led away by her parents. In the book, his parents threw him into a dark hole that leads to the real world. After scaring away an angry mob, he arrives at his swamp, enters an outhouse, and literally breaks out as the adult Shrek. Though surly, dangerous, cynical, misanthropic, and venomously cranky, Shrek is peaceful and does not care to hurt anyone, but just wants to live in solitude and be left alone. Shrek is accompanied by Donkey, an excitable and hyperactive talking donkey. When Shrek is first seen, he successfully scares off villagers by roaring at them, but it later becomes obvious that they were only attacking him because he is an ogre rather than because he did anything wrong. In Shrek, during a conversation with Donkey, he laments that he is constantly judged by the outside world the minute people meet him, and is thus better off alone (\\"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big stupid ugly ogre!' They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.\\"). This implies that he became a recluse after trying and failing to find acceptance among others. Another factor causing lack of acceptance can be found in Shrek the Third, where it is revealed that Shrek's father tried to eat him (\\"I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to bathe me in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.\\"). When he finds squatters where he lives, he attempts to evict them only to learn he has no legal recourse against them, for he does not own the swamp. Shrek is hired by Lord Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona in exchange for the deed to the swamp, with which he can legally banish the squatters. However, during the course of the mission, Shrek falls deeply in love with Fiona and eventually stops her wedding with Farquaad and marries her himself. Being an ogre, Shrek has considerable physical strength, being able to break wood and metal constructs, get in physical combat with a number of armored humans and usually winning, and even lifting or turning objects that are too heavy for a normal human being, such as a gigantic vat of magic potion against the maximum security of the Fairy Godmother in Shrek 2. In Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!, Shrek sings \\"Just the Way You Are\\". In Far Far Away Idol, he sang \\"What I Like About You\\" by The Romantics with Fiona. Shrek has difficulty socializing due to the fact that people think he is a mean ugly ogre, even though his appearance is remarkably humanoid, with a few cosmetic exceptions. In the process, Shrek is said to have sociophobia. However, from Shrek the Third onward, Shrek has become a well-liked celebrity, at least in Far Far Away. In the fourth movie, people manage to realize that Shrek is not dangerous and lose their fear and prejudice against him, but to Shrek's dismay they also come to regard him as a folk hero and visit him with even more frequency than before, disturbing him. But after the experiences of the movie, Shrek comes to appreciate his life more than ever. Character development for film When Steven Spielberg purchased the book rights in 1991, he had planned for Bill Murray to play Shrek. In 1996, DreamWorks hired Chris Farley to do the voice. Farley had recorded 80 to 90% of the dialogue for the character, but died in December 1997, before completing the project. This would result in development of the film being scrapped, such as storyboards and recording sessions, which cost $34 million alone. Shrek screenwriter Terry Rossio describes Farley's vocal performance as being \\"extraordinary\\". In August 2015, footage of Farley voicing the character, originally from 1997, was leaked across the Internet. In August 1998, DreamWorks then re-cast the role with Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek. In February 2000, after Myers had completed providing the voice for the character, and after a rough cut of the film, he asked to re-record all of his lines in a Scottish accent, similar to the one his mother had used when she told him bedtime stories, and also used in previous films he was in such as So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999). Myers explained his decision, \\"There is a class struggle in Shrek between the fairytale kings and queens and the common people. I always thought that Shrek was raised working class. And since Lord Farquaad (the villain) was played English, I thought of Scottish\\". After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, \\"It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again.\\" Nicolas Cage was offered the role of Shrek at one point, but turned it down. Myers stated that the reason he was interested in voicing the character was remembrances of his mother acting out fairy tales: Myers later reported: \\"I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character... And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie.\\" Some early sketches of Shrek's house were done in 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. At one point, he was to live with his parents and keep rotting fish in his bedroom. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration for Shrek's swamp. Reception and other media appearances Shrek appears in the stage musical version of the 2001 film, which debuted in 2008. The role was originated by Broadway actor Brian d'Arcy James, who earned a Tony nomination for it. The character has remained virtually unchanged in the musical, as does the plot. However, various minor details differ between the musical and the film. Other actors to play the role include Ben Crawford (Broadway), Eric Petersen (National Tour), Jacob Ming-Trent (Broadway understudy), Brian Gonzales (Broadway/National Tour understudy), David Foley, Jr. (National Tour understudy), and from 2011 ‚Äì Nigel Lindsay (West End). On May 21, 2010, Shrek received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles. In video games, Shrek appeared as an unlockable player in Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and as a playable character in both Madagascar Kartz and DreamWorks Super Star Kartz. On social media sites, Shrek has been portrayed in a variety of image macros.

In the mid 12th century the De-vauxs built a 'castri' on the Fidra, a chapel at Gullane, a tower of 'Eilbote' at Archerfield (which must have been a place of some importance since King David signed a charter for the lands of Carberry witnessed at 'El bottle' ) and finally a stone castle at Dirleton itself during the reign of King Alexander II of Scots (1214-1249)\\" James VI of Scotland visited several times, as a guest of Sir John Carmichael, who built the castle, which was described in January 1591 as 'a fair house' when Carmichael was having a dispute over the ownership of the site with the Laird of Innerwick.

It lies south of Ottringham and to the north of the Humber Estuary. The Greenwich Meridian passes through the east of the parish. According to the 2011 UK census, Sunk Island parish had a population of 228, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 224. History Church Farm Sunk Island originated as a sand bank in the Humber Estuary; at first it was open sea, then sand accumulated there until visible at low tides, then at all tides. Colonel Anthony Gilby made the outer banks, empoldering it and making it useful for pasturage, under lease/gift from the crown.Philosophical Transactions, vol 30, p. 1015 By the reign of Charles I of England, it was said to form a island, from the mainland. From 1663, the land around it was gradually drained, and by the mid-18th century, the channel separating it from the shore had entirely silted up. It was parished in 1831. The island has an area of . There is an account of the island from 1711 by the Reverend Francis Brokesby of Shottesbrooke, which was reproduced in 1799.\\"Sunk Island\\", Hull Advertiser and Exchange Gazette, 9 February 1799, p7 This account was originally written as a contribution to Leland's Itinerary, vol vi, p96. \\"The Island of Sunk, in Humber, figured in the map of the East-Riding of Yorkshire, in the last edition of The Brittania, and indeed could not be in those of Mr Camden's setting forth, because not then nor many years after in being. It was spoken of as a novelty when I first went into Yorkshire, forty four years ago. A little after which time it was bestowed on Colonel Anthony Gilby, then Deputy-Governor of Hull, by a grant from King Charles II. It is reported to be at first a great bank of sand, (of which there are still many to be seen in Humber at low water) that at thereat other mud and mattter stopt; and then still more and more by degrees, until it arrived at its present bigness.\\" The Reverend Brokesby then gives an account from someone who lived on the Island, as follows \\"The Island, when it was given to Colonel A.G. was never quite overflown but at spring tides. At neap tides (as I am informed by some of the oldest mariners in this place) it was constantly, for as long as they remember, dry and had on the highest parts grass. It is reckoned about seven miles about, and is of an oblong figure; and is separated from Holderness by a channel near two miles broad, which as low water is almost dry, and in forty of fifty years (according to the computations of people who live near it, and who pretend to ground their account on good observations) is expected to be wholly filled up, and the island joined to the main land, if that be a proper expression when a smaller island is joined to a larger. Ir produces all sort of grain, but especially barley and oats, which comes to much greater perfection than in any other part of Yorkshire besides, or in the neighbouring counties. Besides these, there grows a great deal of woad, which is a plant for dying with, or at least to giving the ground for blue and green, as I am informed. There are near 2000 acres enclosed with high banks to keep out the sea, which otherwise would overflow the island at spring tides. Besides this, there are six or seven hundred acres more of very good ground, and as fine grass as any in England, not enclosed, and therefore frequently overflown at high tides, on which they feed a great many horses and sheep. But tho' it be overflown, the water rises not much above the ground, so that it is soon dry again. Most of these horses and sheep are bred upon the island and thrive very well; especially the horses, which are chiefly of the large size for coaches. They have lately put several thousand couples of black rabbits upon it, whose furs are more valuable than the common grey. ..... There are three houses upon the island and nightmen to keep care of the banks and other matters.\\" A fort was built at the outbreak of the First World War. Today, the settlement consists of a church, a few houses and various farms. Cottages were built 1855‚Äì7 by Samuel Sanders Teulon.

Born in Valenciennes, Pater was the son of sculptor Antoine Pater and studied under him before becoming a student of painter Jean-Baptiste Guide. Pater then moved to Paris, briefly becoming a pupil of Antoine Watteau in 1713. Watteau, despite treating Pater badly, had a significant influence on him. However the two quarreled and Pater returned to Valenciennes, where he remained for two years. In 1721, Pater and the dying Watteau reconciled; subsequently Pater became a student of Watteau once again, although only for a month before the latter's death. Pater later claimed to have learnt everything he knew during those few weeks with Watteau.

Po Artmedii Petr≈æalka u≈æ neostalo v√¥bec niƒç  History   First pitch  The first sample football match of Pozsonyi Torna Egyes√ºlet (PTE) was announced to be played on 25 September 1898, but due to the tragic matters in the Emperors' family (Elisabeth of Bavaria died on 10 September 1898) was postponed to 2 October 1898. The rules of the game were explained to the audience before the match in October. The match was played between members of PTE in both teams at the Ligetfalu highschool playground. There was no regular football pitch in Pressburg at that time, so PTE used the plain terrain to play its home matches in the beginning years.  ≈†tadi√≥n za Star√Ωm mostom (PTE stadium)  During the extra ordinary club meeting on 29 September 1899 the decision to build the regular pitch for PTE nearby to the Danube river, railway to the Wien and City Park was made. The stadium was built at the end of the 19th century for PTE in a year. The grand opening of the new stadium was officially on 25 September 1900. PTE won the match against Magyar Football Club Budapest 3‚Äì2, the first PTEs' win ever against the team from Budapest. This stadium was used for Bratislava regional championship until the stadium for I. ƒåsl. ≈†K Bratislava was built in the end of the 1920s. More than 100 years later Artmedia still used to play their home matches at the same place ‚Äì named ≈†tadi√≥n za Star√Ωm mostom. Demolition of Petr≈æalka stadium (Oct 2012) The pitch at the place of the stadium has been there for more than a hundred years. Even before World War II, the stadium was the venue of several international matches. Although destroyed during the war, new stand soon arose from the ruins of the old one and the stadium started to resemble its current look. Major changes have occurred in last ten years, following improvements in Artmedia's footballing results. Stands behind goals were totally reconstructed and a new one was built along the pitch. Today's estimated capacity is 10,000; it is however impossible to give the exact value, because older part of the stadium still remains for standing visitors. The average attendance of league matches at this stadium is floating above 4,000, one of the highest in Slovakia. However, the stadium does not meet some of the UEFA criteria, therefore the club has been forced to play its international matches elsewhere. Notably, they played their 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Champions League campaign at Teheln√© pole, home venue of crosstown rivals Slovan Bratislava. Stadium was closed in 2009 and demolished 2012.

He has recently developed two new theories. First, there is attentional control theory (with Nazanin Derakshan, Rita Santos, and Manuel Calvo), which provides a cognitive account of the effects of anxiety on performance. Second, there is vigilance-avoidance theory (with Nazanin Derakshan and Lynn Myers), which provides a detailed theory of repressive coping.

Since June 2011, the station has employed exclusively a news and talk format; until then, the station carried at least some classical music. The station maintains studios on Mainstream Drive north of downtown Nashville, studios that some consider among the finest radio production facilities in the U.S.  Overview  Nashville Public Radio offers five program streams: WPLN (AM); WPLN-FM; HD-2 and HD-3, which are multicasts from the main FM channel; and WNXP (see below). All five are also streamed on the radio station's website. WPLN-FM's signal, which is transmitted from a tower on Johnson Chapel Road in Williamson County (just outside Brentwood), travels in about a 65-mile radius, reaching most of Middle Tennessee and some counties in southern Kentucky. WPLN-FM shares the tower with three other Nashville FM stations: WRLT, WKDF, and WNRQ; it has broadcast from that site since 1984. WPLN also repeats its programming on two low-powered repeaters on the fringes of the Middle Tennessee area: WHRS 91.7 FM in Cookeville and WTML 91.5 FM in Tullahoma. In early 2006, WPLN-FM began broadcasting its programming in digital. More information is found below. On September 8, 2009, WPLN-FM discontinued its 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. classical music programming in favor of a block of news-and-talk programs from NPR and other providers.http://wpln.org/?page_id=10957http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2009/08/31/daily36.html That action reflected a trend in medium-sized markets towards orienting public radio schedules in favor of more popular (and perhaps more accessible) political and features programming and away from classical music, whose audiences are aging, according to market researchers. However, the demand for the spoken word programs grew to the point that station officials decided to acquire the Vanderbilt University-owned student station WRVU and convert it into a full-time classical music station, WFCL, on 91.1 FM, on June 7, 2011. WPLN thereafter became a full-time news-and-talk station, with feature programming on weekends. This action is similar to earlier ones involving public radio stations and college stations in San Francisco and Houston (the Houston station, however, has since become a religious-formatted non- commercial FM). As is the case with other similarly-formatted NPR affiliates, WPLN only broadcasts music programming on Saturday evenings, with a mixture of folk and alternative rock shows. History Former logo WPLN began as a modest extension of the city's public library system, beginning operations on December 17, 1962 from the Richland Park library branch on Charlotte Avenue in West Nashville. It broadcast a limited schedule, almost entirely of classical music, only on Mondays through Fridays, and was only heard in and around the city of Nashville proper. A year later, Nashville and Davidson County merged to form a metropolitan government. The library‚Äîand with it WPLN‚Äîbecame an arm of the new structure. In 1965, the library moved the station into the then- newly constructed main library downtown (it has since been replaced). By that time, the station had begun operating a full seven days a week. The station was one of the 73 charter members of National Public Radio in 1970‚Äîone of the first public radio stations in the South to join the network. The station's website claims it joined NPR in 1968, but this is incorrect; NPR was not founded until two years later. In 1972, WPLN began broadcasting in stereo and at a full 100,000 watts of power. A \\"Talking Library\\" subchannel for blind (and visually impaired) residents of the area began in 1975. Schedule and programming expansion continued at a steady pace throughout the 1980s and 1990s, while WPLN's physical plant did not expand beyond a block of rooms in the library building. In order to rectify the space shortage and provide more extensive service to the community than was possible under the budgetary and bureaucratic constraints of the public library system, the library board decided in 1995 to begin proceedings to release the station to an independent community board. The public library relinquished control of WPLN-FM on October 1, 1996 to a group known as \\"Nashville Public Radio.\\" The station eventually moved out of the library into a modern studio in the Metrocenter area on May 24, 1998. The success of this move may have prompted the Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County school system, which operated public television outlet WDCN (channel 8), to follow suit three years later. That station is now WNPT. WPLN-FM was one of only a few non-commercial FM licenses held by a public library system in the U.S. In most cases, libraries usually operate radio frequencies only for radio-reading services (like that mentioned above) for the blind and visually impaired, signals that are available only on special receivers. Governance WPLN is governed by a self-perpetuating board of directors, with a separate board of local residents who advise the board of directors on the needs of the listening area.  Digital broadcasting/WPLN-HD2/WPLN-HD3  In addition to the main FM and AM channels, WPLN now has two digital multicast stations: 90.3 FM HD-2 and 90.3 FM HD-3. Initially, 90.3 HD-2 featured primarily classical music and music programs, such as The World Cafe and Echoes. In June 2011, following the launch of Classical 91 One, 90.3 HD-2 switched to carrying time-shifted programming from WPLN's main channel. On May 22, 2014, after WPLN discontinued WRVU from its HD3 Channel, and moved XPoNential Radio from its HD2 Channel, to broadcasting full-time on its HD3 Channel, WPLN replaced its time-shifted programming from WPLN's main channel with a Simulcast of its AM sister station (WPLN-AM). XPoNential Radio was previously heard on WPLN HD2 overnights, from 6 PM - 6 AM. 90.3 HD-3 initially carried much of the same programming as WPLN-AM. In June 2011, the HD-3 subchannel was temporarily silenced. On September 1, 2011 at noon, 90.3 HD-3 returned to the air, returning the college alternative format of Vanderbilt University's WRVU to the Nashville airwaves. This lasted until May 22, 2014, when WPLN discontinued WRVU from its HD3 Signal (due to low ratings) and replaced it with XPoNential Radio. WRVU's programming is now solely available online, with no terrestrial broadcasting. These multicast stations can be heard using a special HD Radio receiver. 90.3 HD-2 can also be streamed on the internet through WPLN's website, and 90.3 HD-3 can be streamed on the internet through XPoNential Radio's website.http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=33 HD Radio guide for Nashville Sister stations In 2002, Nashville Public Radio purchased an existing Medium Wave station to broadcast NPR and local news, talk, and public affairs programs for which the FM did not originally have time on its schedule. The new WPLN-HD2 and HD3 have given Middle Tennessee residents even more choices of music and spoken-word shows. For more information, see WPLN (AM).

Born in London, and largely self-taught, he originally composed as a sideline while working for the BBC. In the UK, he is well known for pieces such as The Girl From Corsica, High Heels and the March from A Little Suite, all of which gained fame as television and radio themes.David Ad√®s, Interview and biography at the Robert Farnon Society, Retrieved 13 November 2010 Life Trevor Duncan was born Leonard Charles Trebilcock (he later shortened this to Trebilco) in Camberwell, London, England. By twelve he could play the piano by ear, but wanted to learn to read and compose music properly. Thus, for one year he attended the Trinity College of Music for an external course on violin, harmony and counterpoint. However, his early knowledge of music was largely self-taught. At eighteen, Duncan joined the British Broadcasting Corporation assisting in the production of radio plays. In 1943 he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force where he became a wireless operator. After his discharge from the RAF in 1947 he was given the opportunity to go to Cambridge University, but decided to return to BBC Radio as a sound and balance engineer working with many light orchestras. It was by studying scores and their orchestral effects that Duncan gained knowledge about composition and it was through an encounter with the conductor Ray Martin that Duncan had his first piece Vision in Velvet performed. However, the BBC restricted its own employees from having music performed on air. Thus, he concentrated on writing music to be recorded for newsreels and other companies not connected with the BBC. It was also at this point he chose his pseudonym, Trevor Duncan, a reference to a school nickname. Ray Martin's approval of his next piece, the famous High Heels encouraged Duncan to approach Boosey & Hawkes, who approved it for recording. The piece enjoyed immediate success, with numerous radio performances and a commercial recordings. In the next few years Duncan composed numerous works and he became one of the most prolific writers of so- called 'mood' music. With his success, he was unable to keep his BBC identity separate from his growing fame as a composer. In 1954 Duncan was promoted to be a music producer, and this conflict of interests meant that the BBC could not schedule any of his works in its programmes. Duncan made the decision to concentrate on composing full-time and left the BBC in 1956. In 1959, he composed his two most famous works The Girl From Corsica and the Little Suite. The first of these was used as the theme music for the BBC Television serial of Francis Durbridge's The Scarf; the opening March from the second was used as the signature tune for Dr. Finlay's Casebook. However, after light music began to be heard less in the UK, he turned his attention to more serious orchestral works. Until his death in 2005, Trevor Duncan continued composing, living with his wife and daughter in Somerset. He died in Taunton, Somerset, aged 81. Works Trevor Duncan's most famous works are mainly classed in the light music category. As well as those mentioned above, these include Children in the Park, 20th Century Express, Sixpenny Ride, Wine Festival and Meadow Mist, but in 1958 he composed the title music to the BBC‚Äôs serial of ‚ÄúQuatermass and the Pit‚Äù, known as Mutations. He was also a composer of more serious major orchestral works. His largest work, the Sinfonia Tellurica, composed in 1970, was a symphony based on the elements and man's achievements. Other larger compositions include The Navigators, St Boniface Down, A Tale of Two Hearts, The Visionaries and The Challenge of Space. His library music appears in many productions of the 1950s and 60s, such as The Key Man (1957), Strange Awakening (1958) and Chris Marker's La jet√©e (1962).Credits at the Internet Movie Database Most infamously, his library piece \\"Grip of the Law\\" was chosen by Gordon Zahler as the opening titles of Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space.[ All Music] biography More recently, he is credited with film- score music for the film The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes (2005) and was also writing a musical shortly before his death.

Like their contemporaries in the band Landser, Macht und Ehre was formed by members of a 1980s extremist group called Die Vandalen. They are among the oldest German bands to continually produce extreme-right music. History Macht und Ehre was formed in a Berlin prison (JVA Pl√∂tzensee), circa 1991, by vocalist Stephan Jones. Thus, they predate the seminal German neo-Nazi band Landser by one year. Throughout the years, the band underwent such a frequent rotation of instrumental musicians that Jones is generally the only one credited as a member. Macht und Ehre is officially banned by German law, but their records are recorded and released through distributors in other countries. Their song \\"Torsten Koch\\" is, according to its lyrics, dedicated to a neo-Nazi who killed himself in the same prison where Stephan Jones was serving his sentence. The group had a website once, but it was among hundreds that were shut down by the German government in late 2000.heise online - Initiative l√§sst 118 Nazi-Webseiten abschalten Macht und Ehre underwent a slight change in the 2000s, in that their lyrics are less overtly extreme. In the early days, they sang songs with lyrics like: \\"Auschwitz, Dachau, und Buchenwald - da machen wir die Juden auf's Neue kalt!\\" (Der Ewige Jude), which in English translates as: \\"Auschwitz, Dachau and Buchenwald - there we'll kill the Jews again!\\" Other songs from their early days had titles like: \\"Ali Drecksau\\" (Ali dirty pig), \\"Kanacke Raus\\" (Kanake is a racist German word for dark skinned people, mainly from the south, equivalent to the English sand nigger). In their more recent releases, their songs contain themes of anti- Communism, German pride, and anti-Americanism, but their lyrics are hardly as harsh as their earlier songs; for instance, now there is no explicit mention of violence‚Äîonly opposition (however, violence is implied in some song lyrics). This could be to avoid legal crackdowns, to appeal to a broader audience, or both. As a harbinger of sorts, after six years of silence, the group released Schwarzer Orden in 2003, which contained re-recordings of some earlier M&E; songs with new lyrics that were not as extreme as the originals.

Eighth graders are tested in: reading, writing, mathematics and science. Beginning in the Spring of 2013, eighth graders, who are enrolled in Algebra I take the Keystone Exam for Algebra I at the end of the course. The testing of 8th grade in reading and mathematics began in 1999, as a state initiative. Testing in science began in 2007. The goal is for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focus on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The standards were published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.

The process identifies students at risk for dropping out by examining the pupil's: attendance, behavior and course grades. Interventions are implemented to assist at-risk pupils to remain in school. The program is funded by federal and private dollars.Pennsylvania Department of Education, The Early Warning System, 2014 =New High School Building= In 2007 it was announced that a new high school would be built to replace the current high school, built in 1963. The building's condition has been declining over the past few years. The new high school is estimated to be completed in time for the 2011-2012 school year. The official groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 16, 2009. It will cost about $45 Million Dollars. As of November 2008, the district has begun to lay a new pipeline system for the new high school. This will run through the current one to supply city water, as the current water supply is unsanitary. Trash bags have been placed over drinking fountains to prevent consumption. Water coolers have been placed around the current high school to compensate for the lack of water. The new High School contains a lunch room known as the commons, office, guidance office, nurse office, auxiliary gym that includes a wrestling mat, a multi purpose gym, a fitness room, a print lab, lgi lab used for extra curriculum needs, auditorium that can hold over 1,000 people, band and chorus room, 2 art labs, 1 food lab, security desk, over 200 class rooms, etc. In the year 2014 the Dallas School Board voted on a brand new all purpose Turf Field. It was completed in just 2 months and Dallas held its first ever football game under the lights vs Wyoming valley west. Dallas lost that game. Alert System In December 2007, Dallas adopted a method of quickly contacting student's homes. During school closings, delays, early dismissals, or other public announcements, the district will send a message to all homes that it may affect. Calls are put out as early as 5am during school closings or delays. This tool is known as \\"Connect-ED\\".

Special education In December 2015, the district administration reported that 382 pupils, or 13.8% of the district's pupils, received Special Education services, with 45% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2013, the district administration reported that 347 pupils, or 12.6% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 47% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, the administration reported that 363 pupils, or 13% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 47.1% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. The district administration reported that 348 students or 12% were receiving special education services in 2009. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Dallas School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2015. The district has seen an increase in the number of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. The district makes use of Luzerne Intermediate Unit Operated Programs to meet the student's needs. By Pennsylvania law, the district has 60 calendar days, after receiving parental consent, to complete the evaluation. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and school website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Dallas School District students, who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP), may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district‚Äôs students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student‚Äôs needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Dallas School District received a $1,112,033 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. *2014-15 school year, Dallas School District received an increase to $1,133,927 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 *2016-17 school year, Dallas School District received a 1.5% increase in state special education funding to $1,176,682.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016-17, July 2016 In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 168 or 6.16% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The school district administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 ;Teacher union strikes On December 19, 2016, the Dallas Teachers Union returned to work under the terms of their old contract. The strike lasted five weeks. The Board was required to reset the school calendar eliminating many holidays in order to finish the school year by June 15. On November 14, 2016, Dallas School District Teachers Union went on strike, due to not receiving their demands for higher pay and more costly benefits. There have been multiple teach union strikes in Pennsylvania in 2016, including: Shamokin Area School District, Highlands School District Montrose Area School District and Athens Area School District. In December 2016, Ambridge Area Teachers Union went on strike. Of the nearly 140 teacher strikes that occurred nationally between 2000 and 2007, 60 percent took place in Pennsylvania, according to a report released in August 2012, by the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy. Pennsylvania is one of 13 states in which teacher strikes are legal. Pennsylvania has the highest rate of teacher strikes in the United States. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there were three teacher union strikes in 2010; one teacher union strike in 2011, one teacher union strike in 2012 and three teacher union strikes in 2013.Mary Niederberger., Laws, tax limits hinder negotiations, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 5, 2013 Crestwood School District in Luzerne County went on strike in 2009.

Dallas School District teachers receive a daily preparation period and a retirement incentive that is up to 70% of the prior year's salary. Dallas School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2014-15, the state mandated district contribution to the teacher pension fund rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total district salaries. In 2007, Dallas School District employed over 155 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $47,943 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob, Average classroom teacher salary in Luzerne County, 2006-07, The Morning Call, March 2009 In 2009, the district reported employing over 198 teachers with a salary range of $33,426 to $100,000 and a median teacher salary of $50,319.

The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion.

Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, Governor Rendell and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software Race to the Top grant School district officials applied for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. The teachers' union agreed to support the effort. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of a majority of school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Title II grants The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school.

After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2016-17 were set by the school board at 13.1380 mills. Dallas School Board has raised real estate taxes every year since 2005. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. There are a plethora of gas pipelines in the district due to marcellus shale gas development. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Located in the marcellus shale region. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two or more counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders like Dallas School District. In 2008, Luzerne County conducted a property value reassessment. Under Pennsylvania law, districts were required to set real estate taxes to a new equal level yielding no added revenues. *2015-16 - 12.6261 mills *2014-15 - 12.3423 mills *2013-14 - 12.0413 mills *2012-13 - 11.8052 mills Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 11.5624 mills. *2010-11 - 11.0118 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2010 *2009-10 - 10.6498 mills Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Finances Real Estate Tax Rates 2009-10, 2010 *2008-09 - 262.000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Real Estate Tax Rates 2008-09, 2009 *2007-08 - 253.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 244.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 222.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Luzerne County residents amounts to about 3.02% of their yearly income.

The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The district offers a summer aquatics program that is open to all district residents. All lessons are taught by ARC certified Water Safety Instructors. There is a small fee for the swim lessons. The district's students have access to a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by the school board policyDallas School Board Policy Manual Extracurriculars Policy 122 and Interscholastic Athletics Policy 123 in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. In March 2008, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a special investigation of the Dallas School District. It found that the athletic director, who also was a school guidance counselor, had misappropriated $4,869 from Dallas School District's Athletic Fund. Sports The Girls field hockey team has won the 2007 PIAA District 2 championship and were state semi-finalists. They also peaked at #6 in the National Polls midway through the season. The Boys and Girls soccer teams also won district championships in the 2007-2008 school year along with the softball team and Girls Track and Field team which has won 3 consecutive district 2 titles (2005, 2006, 2007). In the 2008-2009 year, the teams from Dallas to win district titles are Boys Cross Country, Girls Cross Country, Girls diving, Girls Soccer, and Softball. State Championships from Dallas include, Football in 1993, Girls Cross Country in 2003 and 2005, Girls Soccer in 2007, and Baseball in 2017.

Born into a prominent local family and well-educated, Jakob followed in the footsteps of his father Harald Ulrik Sverdrup and his uncle Johan Sverdrup by pursuing both a theological and political life. He served five terms in the Norwegian Parliament between 1877 and 1898, and was a cabinet member on several occasions. Originally a member of the Liberal Party, he later joined the Moderate Liberal Party, having partially been the cause of the split that formed the Moderate Liberal Party. He has been referred to as \\"one of the most controversial figures in modern Norwegian history\\". Personal life Sverdrup, born in Christiania, was the first of Harald Ulrik Sverdrup and Caroline Suur's eight children, one of five sons. Raised in Balestrand in the county of Nordre Bergenhus Amt, his father was a prominent local figure in ecclesiastical and political affairs, as a priest, mayor and member of the Norwegian Parliament. Johan Sverdrup, his uncle, was Prime Minister of Norway from 1884 to 1889. Jakob Sverdrup was close to his brother Georg Sverdrup, who emigrated to the United States in 1874 and later became the President of the Augsburg Seminary. His youngest brother Edvard Sverdrup became a professor of the MF Norwegian School of Theology in Oslo. Jakob Sverdrup fathered the academics Jakob Sverdrup, Jr. and Georg Johan Sverdrup, and was the uncle of oceanographer and meteorologist Harald Ulrik Sverdrup. His daughter Aslaug Sverdrup took the doctor's degree too, and was married to biologist Iacob Dybwad S√∏mme from January 1930 to 1942. Career Sverdrup enrolled as a student, and graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1869. Inspired by Grundtvigianism, he founded a folk high school in Sogndal in 1871. Serving as savings bank director as well as mayor of Sogndal, he was the manager of Sogndal folk high school from its foundation, but left that post to his brother Hersleb Sverdrup after a few years, before Henrik Mohn Dahl took over. In 1878 Jakob Sverdrup left Sogndal to become vicar in Leikanger. As a theologian, Sverdrup was a pietist, and sided with the laity movement, proposing that lay priests be given the right to preach. Together with Ole Vollan he had started the magazine Ny Luthersk Kirketidende in 1877, an organ which spoke against the Conservative High Church Lutheranism of the time. Sverdrup also published several pamphlets during his life,List of publications in BIBSYS and in 1897 he published Forklaring over Luthers lille katekisme af J. R. Sverdrup, a revision of the explanation of Luther's Small Catechism originally written by his father.Catechism explanations in Norway -- Norsk L√¶rerakademi =National politics= Sverdrup was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1877, representing the constituency of Nordre Bergenhus Amt. He was re-elected in 1880 and 1883, and joined the newly established Liberal Party, of which his uncle Johan was the founder and chairman. When the Liberal cabinet Sverdrup took over in 1884, Jakob Sverdrup was a candidate for the position as Minister of Education and Church Affairs. However, due to King Oscar II opposing this, Sverdrup was instead appointed a member of the Council of State Division in Stockholm, effective from 26 June 1884. However, already on 1 August 1885 Sverdrup was appointed Minister of Church Affairs, replacing Elias Blix. He held this position for a year, but had already become embroiled in controversy. In June 1885 the Norwegian Parliament had voted over whether to grant a poet's pension to the novelist Alexander Kielland. A Christian conservative wing of the Liberal Party, informally spearheaded by Lars Oftedal, stopped this proposition together with the Conservative Party. Kielland was seen as undermining Christian authority and morale in general. The decision was lambasted by Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, who personally sent a similar application the next year; when it was voted down, Bj√∏rnson protested by renouncing his own poet's pension. A commentator in the liberal newspaper Verdens Gang stated that Jakob Sverdrup was the true mastermind of his uncle's cabinet. The newspaper also speculated on a possible split of the Liberal Party, citing the Kielland case as a part of a broader trend that the Liberal Party failed to actually reform society in a liberal direction. Talks of \\"Moderate\\" and \\"True\\" Liberals had surfaced already ahead of the 1885 election. When installed as Minister of Church Affairs, then, Jakob Sverdrup tried vigorously to establish so-called parish councils, increasing the local democracy in the Church of Norway, but he was voted down by the \\"True\\" Liberals in Parliament who in this case sided with the Conservative Party.S√∏rensen, 1984: 73 Several cabinet members demanded Sverdrup's resignation, but instead he was transferred to the post as Minister of Auditing on 31 July 1886, allowing Elias Blix to return as Minister of Church Affairs. However, the controversy continued to grow, and in 1888 the cabinet members Hans Rasmus Astrup, Birger Kildal, Sofus Anton Birger Arctander and Elias Blix withdrew from their positions in protest. Thus, on 24 February 1888 Sverdrup returned as Minister of Church Affairs, holding two posts for a while before a replacement as Minister of Auditing was found on 4 March 1888. On 12 July 1889 the cabinet Sverdrup fell. The Liberal Party had been split, with a breakaway faction forming the Moderate Liberal Party, and this gave way for the Conservative first cabinet Stang. In 1890 Jakob Sverdrup moved from Nordre Bergenhus Amt to become a vicar in Bergen. Nonetheless, he was placed on the party ticket in his old county Nordre Bergenhus Amt for the forthcoming election. He was thus elected twice, in 1892 and 1895, but now belonged to the Moderate Liberal Party. Following the latter election Jakob Sverdrup was twice asked by King Oscar II to form a new cabinet, but the efforts failed. Instead, the Conservative-Moderate first cabinet Hagerup assumed office on 14 October 1895, where Jakob Sverdrup was appointed Minister of Church Affairs for a third time. He held this position until the first cabinet Hagerup fell on 17 February 1898. The same year he was appointed as the new bishop of the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin; however, he never actually assumed the office due to health problems. He died in June 1899. Sverdrup was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1885 and was a Commander of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star.

Henryka Reymana is a football-specific stadium in Krak√≥w, Poland. It is currently used as home ground by Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w football team playing in the Ekstraklasa. The address of the stadium is Krak√≥w, ul. Reymonta 22. The stadium has a capacity of 33,326 spectators, who are all seated, and is fully roofed. Wis≈Ça Stadium is the fourth largest arena in Ekstraklasa. Stadium was originally built in 1953. From 2003 ‚Äì 2011 the stadium was completely reconstructed with four new stands and a media pavilion being built. Reconstruction was finally completed in October 2011. Thanks to resolution passed by Krak√≥w City council on 23 January 2008, the stadium is named after Wis≈Ça's legendary player Henryk Tomasz Reyman. Municipal Stadium in Krak√≥w meets the criteria for UEFA Category 4. History =Previous grounds of Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w= The current stadium is the third home of the Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. The first stadium was located about 500m away from the current location in the Oleandry area. It was built in 1914 and inaugurated on 16 April same year, with a 3‚Äì2 win over Czarni Lw√≥w, but only one year later it burned down. That stadium was never finished and World War I left only rubble of the ground. In 1922 Wis≈Ça moved to a new stadium in the same area. This one survived World War II, but couldn't cope with the post-war popularity of football. Moreover, in 1946 Krak√≥w was afflicted by a huge storm and stadium has been seriously damaged. =Current stadium location= In May 1953 the new stadium - third one in Wis≈Ça history - was opened next to the old stadium. This is a place where Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w plays their home matches today. Stadium featured an oval running track surrounding football field. A characteristic feature of this building was called ‚ÄòBrandenburg Gates‚Äô located on the stands behind the goals. =The '70s & ‚Äò80s= Floodlights masts was installed on the stadium in 1972. Their officially inauguration took place on 11 June 1972 during league match between Wisla Krak√≥w and Legia Warsaw, which ended in a draw 1:1. In 1976 Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w was playing Celtic Glasgow in UEFA Cup. After the team having drawn the first game away 2:2, crowds were flocking to see Wis≈Ça fight with the Bhoys on 29 September. The media and fans present at the game say of approximately 45 000 spectators, however the precise number is unknown. This game (won 2:0) holds the stadium's record of attendance. In 1985 plans to build new main stand was announced. Therefore, sectors I, II, III, IV and V (whole main stand) had been demolished. However, lack of funds for continuation of construction resulted in situation in which stadium remained without a main stand for more than 10 next years. =The '90s & ‚Äò00s= Renovation of south stand and floodlights masts dismantling took place in 1995 year. Construction of the new main stand started in 1996. It was financed by the joint office of the City of Krak√≥w and Totalizator Sportowy. Opening of the new grandstand (sectors A and B, as well as VIP sector) took place in March 1998 during the league match between Wis≈Ça and GKS Katowice. In 1998, the east stand underwent yet another renovation. Around 4800 plastic seats were installed. Also, oval running track surrounding football pitch was completely removed. Artificial hills behind the goals was demolished in January 1999. In July 2000, on the side of 3 Maja street, temporary south stand for the visiting team's supporters was constructed, with capacity about 250 people. Over time it has been expanded to holds 500 people. In April 2002, new floodlights masts was installed to meet requirements imposed by the Polish Football Association. In June 2003, turf heating system was installed. In June 2004 the licensing requirements imposed by the Polish Football Association forced Wis≈Ça to build temporary all-seater and fully roofed north stand. Its capacity was about 1000 people. At the same time, it was also decided to reduce the height of the fence in front of the main stand to 1 m, in order to improve comfort of watching the matches. 2004-2011 Redevelopment (New stadium) =Overall= The construction project developed by architecture and design studio owned by Wojciech Obtu≈Çowicz has been changed four times with key features remaining the same. The first conception assumed the construction of the stadium for more than 20 000 seats with leaving of the main stand which was built in the mid nineties. According to this project in November 2004, the construction of a new south stand has begun with striker Maciej ≈ªurawski digging the first shovel. It was completed in June 2006, costing nearly 35 mln z≈Ç. The main contractor was Budimex Dromex. In the meantime, in January 2006, construction of the twin northern stand has begun. Its construction lasted 12 months with both the contractor and the cost were exactly the same as in the case of the southern stand. Wis≈Ça Stadium fa√ßade In April 2007 it was announced that the UEFA European Football Championship in 2012 will be co-hosted by Poland. Krak√≥w and Wis≈Ça Stadium, was chosen to be a reserve host for upcoming event. Therefore, the stadium project was changed to meets the requirements for elite class stadium. In September 2007, Budimex Dromex started the construction of media pavilion - a building that was part of the previous concept of the stadium. In October the architectural studio of Wojciech Obtu≈Çowicz has been commissioned to carry out the new stadium project. It cost about 3.5 million z≈Ç. In January 2008 the construction of media pavilion was completed. The total cost of this investment exceeded 11 million z≈Ç. The demolition of the old east stand begun in May 2008. In February 2009 Polimex-Mostostal started the construction of the new East stand, whose cost was approximately 144 million z≈Ç. After the end of 2008/09 Ekstraklasa season in June 2009, Polimex-Mostostal began demolition of the main stand (west) and the construction of the new one. The cost was over 153 million z≈Ç. Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w played its 2009/2010 season matches at Stadion Ludowy in Sosnowiec and Stadion Suche Stawy, due to more advanced construction works on the stadium. In early October 2009, the contractor which built two stands Polimex-Mostostal, applied to the investor for financing the project by an additional 28.9 million z≈Ç. The grant would cover the cost of rebuilding the installations network under the stadium. On 1 November 2009 the architectural studio of Wojciech Obtu≈Çowicz was released from its contract for construction project of the stadium. The reason for exclusion of the architect was that it could not keep up with making of amendments to its draft, which contained some incorrect data. For that reason, it was impossible to continue construction at the right pace and resulted in some major delays in work. Redesign took the lead contractor - Polimex-Mostostal. On 4 November 2009 the Krak√≥w city councilors voted to transfer additional funds amounted to 29.9 million z≈Ç for the stadium construction. In case donation has not been awarded then the contractor building of both stands (east and west) could stop the construction and request compensation from The City. The mayor of the City of Krak√≥w Jacek Majchrowski presented the estimated cost of building the entire stadium, which in total amounted to 445 million z≈Ç. Finally stadium construction ended in mid-2011. This included construction of whole Main stand and additional works made by Mostostal Warszawa SA in the interior of the north stand. First match with all four stands opened took place at 15 October 2011. The opponent was Jagiellonia Bia≈Çystok and Wisla won 3‚Äì1. Stadium =Layout= The shape of the stadium is the legacy of past construction projects. Two grandstands behind the goals and the media pavilion located in the corner between the western and southern grandstand were built according to the old concept. Both two-level stands along the side lines are the result of implementation of the last fourth construction concepts One of the most important places of the stadium will be the presidential box with an area of 250 m¬≤. At the stadium there are 33 boxes behind glass (called skyboxes), located between the levels of the stands. Each of them have an area of about 35 m¬≤. Each of the lodges have a separate entrance and is equipped with seats of higher standard. In addition, the stadium has 1638 seats for VIP and 477 for the super-VIP. The Wis≈Ça fan shop is located within the east stand. Elevation of the western and eastern stands refer to the colonnade, which was built around the grandstands of the old stadium. Simple mesh lattice were used in construction, which resulted in a larger commercial area inside the stands, in comparison to the northern and southern grandstand, where the elevation is made up of diagonal strands. According to the chief architect of the stadium, Wojciech Obtu≈Çowicz solutions applied during construction process give stadium the atmosphere of the theater. An important advantage of the stadium construction is the large, one-level stands behind the goals, which provide plenty of space inside both structures and greatly affect the quality of doping and the possibility of making more advanced choreos by Wis≈Ça's fans. Another advantage of the stadium project is a roof, equipped with automatic snow melting systems, and the transparency of the material from which it has been built, which has a positive effect on grass growth on the football pitch. The main disadvantage of the stadium construction is the relatively long distance between the grandstands and the football pitch. The construction companies which built each stands have given ten years guarantee for their constructions. =West stand= West stand is the main stand on the stadium with capacity of 9181 spectators. First level can holds 3682 people and it is divided into 6 sections: A1, B11, B12, H1, VIP and VIP lodges - each of them (except VIP lodges) have 18 rows.

This two-level stand has only one corner - the north one. Media pavilon is located in the place of the south corner. There is a wave-like shaped huge roof above the main entrance to this stand. Western stand consists of six floors, the lowest is located below ground level. West stand Lower level of the western stand consists of two parts, which are located at different depths. In the lower part there is underground parking for VIPs and buses of both teams. At the lowest part technical rooms, warehouses and staff rooms are located. Rooms for the referees and changing rooms for the home and away teams are also located there (booth have an area of 100 m¬≤). Reception, information, commercial and gastronomic points are located on the ground floor. Many corridors and halls leading to the staircases, which fans can get to higher floors of the stand are also located on this level. The ground floor also includes panoramic glass elevators and a direct entry for spectators at the first level of the stands. On the first floor there is a representative hall leading to the so-called Sky-boxes, lodges for VIPs and observers. Presidential lodge, which covers an area of nearly 240 m¬≤ and business lounge are located on this floor. The second floor is designed for fans sitting on the second level of the west stand. The vast majority of the surface of the second floor is used for toilets and gastronomic points for spectators. On the third floor there is a media zone, as well as toilets for the disabled persons. Furthermore, gastronomic points and catering hall are located on this floor. Fourth floor is dedicated exclusively for the media. It contains commentators cabins, media working zones as well as television platforms and studios with a panoramic view of the pitch. =East stand= East stand is the biggest two-level stand on the stadium with capacity of 12,831 spectators. First level is divided into 11 sections: D11, D12, E11 to E16, F11, F12 (18 rows each) and VIP lodges. Capacity is 4591.

In contrast to the twin west stand, this has both corners. Entrances to east stand are located on the side of Reymana street. East Stand East stand as well as the west one has two levels and consists of six floors. At the lower (underground) level of this stand, technical rooms and warehouses are located. One of the warehouses is being used by the club shop, located inside the stadium. The largest room on this level is designed for the technical team working on football field maintenance and. Same like west stand, information, commercial and gastronomic points are located on the ground floor. In addition, there are also small warehouses. On the ground floor fans can get through the transparent lobby (whose area is over 2200 m ¬≤) and then direct entrances into the first level of the east stand. On this floor there are also stairways and elevators, which fans can get to higher floors of the stand. Most of the first floor area is occupied by VIP lounges. In addition there are also two conference rooms, offices, gastronomic points and restaurant. On the first floor in the north- east corner there will be a club museum. The second floor is designed for fans sitting on the second level of the west stand.. Most of the area of second floor is occupied by toilets and gastronomic points for spectators.

On the fourth floor of this stand there are balconies, which are used by television stations broadcasting the matches. =North stand= North Stand is one-level stand located behind the goal on the side of W≈Çadys≈Çawa Reymonta street. Capacity is 5642 spectators. This stand is divided into 5 section: C1 to C5 (32 rows each). Construction of the north stand started in 2006 and was completed in January 2007. This part of the stadium is very similar to the existing south stand. Construction project of north stand is a copy of its counterpart of the south stand, which started the construction of a new stadium. The interior of the north stand remained unfinished for about four years. Additional work has been made by Mostostal Warszawa SA and was completed in mid-2011. Work included construction of staircases, entrances for spectators, electrical wiring, water pipe system and sanitary sewer. Since early 2008 North stand is occupied by the most spontaneous and fanatical fans of Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. Especially for the supporters, the middle sections have a white star symbol created of blue, red and white seats. =South stand= South stand is a one-level construction with capacity of 5672 spectators. Construction on the site started in November 2004 with striker Maciej ≈ªurawski digging the first shovel. First supporters entered the stand when it was half-finished in August 2005, for the game against Panathinaikos in Champions League qualifiers. It is concrete and steel structure, covered with roof supported by guy-wires which are anchored into concrete blocks located before entrances to the grandstand. Whole structure is supported by front elevation diagonal, concrete pillars. For navigating and organisational reasons the Stand was called simply \\"Sektor E\\" as A and B were placed on the Main Stand, C was the East and D was the temporary North Stand. Therefore, E was simply the next letter in the alphabet. Nowadays, the stand is signed as G and it is divided into 5 sections (from G1 to G5, 32 rows each). Stand's cost was estimated at 34mln PLN. In the end, this number was exceeded by another 3 mln PLN. Section for visitor supporters is located in the west part of this stand (near Media Pavilon and west stand). After last enlargement, visitor supporters sector is compared of G4 and G5 sections and has capacity of 2043 people. Hence G3 section became a buffer section between home and away fans. The interior of the stands are managed. It includes toilets, lavatories, staircases, entrances for spectators and gastronomic points. File:Nowy stadion Wis≈Çy Krak√≥w.jpgNorth Stand File:Stadion tuz przed meczem.jpgSouth Stand =Media Pavilion= Media Pavilion Media Pavilion is the legacy of the first three stadium projects, according to which the facilities under the stands would not be as developed as they are in the current version. The building is located in the corner, between west and south stands. The construction of the Media Pavilion started in September 2007 and was completed in January 2008. The main contractor was Budimex Dromex and cost was 11 384 mln z≈Ç. The building is 16 meters tall and 22 meters long. On the ground floor there is so-called mixed zone with place where players can give interviews to journalists, stadium kitchen with buffet, toilets and technical rooms. On the first floor of the pavilion's main conference room is located. Capacity of this conference room is about 200 people. Media Pavilion also has a terrace extended inside the stadium. This is a place where television studio will be located during the matches. Media Pavilion is often called OkrƒÖglak. Euro 2012 Krak√≥w was a reserve city for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. Wis≈Ça Stadium was the planned venue for the tournament. Referring to the above matter it was decided to change the project, who had previously assumed stadium capacity of approximately 21 500 seats. The revised draft has greatly increased stadium capacity to meets all the requirements for elite class stadium. 13 May 2009 UEFA Executive Committee decided to confirm the appointment of the four venues initially proposed by the Polish Football Association during the bidding phase and signed by UEFA as official host cities which were Gda≈Ñsk, Pozna≈Ñ, Warsaw and Wroclaw. Thus, Krak√≥w was not appointed as official host city nor retained as reserve city.

At the end of 2013 it reported an annual revenue of approximately $4.2 billion. Tutor Perini is headquartered in Sylmar, California, and works on many construction projects throughout the United States and Canada. Specific areas of focus are civil infrastructure (bridges, highways, tunnels, airports, mass transit systems), building infrastructure (healthcare, education, municipal government, hospitality and gaming, multi-use, office towers, multi-unit residential towers, high- technology projects), and specialty contracting (electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation (HVAC), fire protection systems, concrete placement).  History  In 1949 Albert G. Tutor launched a family construction business, A.G. Tutor Company, Inc. With a compelling combination of innovation and work ethic, the company found immediate success ‚Äî an upward trajectory that continued when Ronald Tutor joined his father's firm in 1963. The company grew exponentially throughout the century under Ronald Tutor. The organization continued its dramatic growth in 1972 through a partnership with N.M. Saliba and, in 1981, when Ron Tutor took the reigns as president of the Tutor-Saliba Corporation. The company continued to evolve into a major force, focusing on exceptional execution of massive, complicated projects. With an eye toward strategic growth, Ronald Tutor identified a potential partner in the Perini Corporation. Established in 1894 by Bonfiglio Perini ‚Äî a stonemason by trade who happened to have a remarkable instinct for construction ‚Äî the company had earned significant recognition for infrastructure work over its decades in business. Seeing an opportunity to bring together two likeminded industry powerhouses, Ron Tutor led a recapitalization of Perini Corporation in 1997. In 2008, the companies officially merged to create a powerful, client-focused firm ‚Äî Tutor Perini Corporation. Today, the company includes more than 20 wholly owned subsidiaries located in the United States and throughout the world. Perini Corporation was founded in 1894 in Ashland, Massachusetts by a stonemason named Bonfiglio Perini. Under the direction of Bonfiglio's grandson, Lou Perini, the company moved into the real-estate business, developing in Palm Beach County, Florida. Later real-estate ventures were less successful, leaving Perini deeply in debt by the mid-1990s. In 1997, Ron Tutor helped Perini Corp. recapitalize alongside investor Richard Blum. Tutor became CEO of Perini in 2000 and merged Perini with Tutor-Saliba in 2008. Perini was listed on the NYSE on April 1, 2004. Perini was headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts until relocating to Sylmar, California in 2009. In May 2009, Perini shareholders voted to change the company's name to Tutor Perini Corporation. Tutor Perini issued $300 million of Senior Notes in October 2010. Tutor Perini proceeded to acquire six companies over the next nine months.  Acquisitions  In 2003, Perini acquired Florida-based James A. Cummings. In 2005, the company acquired Cherry Hill Construction, a Maryland-based contractor, and California-based Rudolph & Sletten, Inc. In January 2009, the corporation acquired Philadelphia-based building contractor Keating Building Corporation.

Other infrastructure includes 24 aircraft sunshades, aerospace ground equipment storage facility, domestic water and fire protection systems pump building, gatehouse and canopy, generator and enclosure, site preparation, and utility upgrades.  Allegations  Tutor Perini has gained a reputation for low balling government contracts only to later increase prices at the expense of the taxpayer: Since 2000 Tutor Perini has costed the state of California $765 million in additional unexpected costs on 11 different projects. This is mostly due to California law which requires the lowest bid to be selected. In 2002, after an expansion at San Francisco International Airport went over budget by $360 million, City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued Tutor Perini for fraud and attempted to have it banned from bidding on city projects. In March 2011, after a four-week trial a federal jury in Brooklyn found Zohrab B. Marashlian, the former president of Perini Corp.‚Äôs Civil Division, guilty of fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Tutor Perini had paid Marashlian $14 million during the investigation and trial. However Marashlian committed suicide Two days before he was to receive a prison sentence. A fellow employee is currently serving time in prison for the same case. In April 2018, Tutor Perini had substituted weaker rails than those specified in the San Francisco construction contract, so the city ordered Tutor Perini to rip out much of the steel track it had already laid down. The San Francisco Examiner reported that this is likely to delay the opening of the subway and that Tutor Perini may file additional claims to recoup their costs.

It was later adapted into an animeMahoujin Guru Guru series on October 13, 1994. A second manga series was serialized in Gangan Online in 2012. Mah≈çjin Guru Guru is a light-hearted series aimed at older children; it contains occasional toilet gags and some innuendo that might startle western parents. It also is a parody of early role-playing video games (RPGs), particularly turn-based games such as the Dragon Quest games. The narrator speaks in place of the dialog in such games, and this is one of the comedy elements of the show. Often role-playing videogame-style information boxes are displayed on screen with accompanying narration in the traditional RPG style. The overall goal of the main characters, Nike and Kukuri, is to defeat Giri, the ruler of the darkness. Since the anime is based on an RPG, several side quests need to be completed before they are able to locate him. A new series based on the manga animated by Production I.G aired from July to December, 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the anime, marking the first anime from the Mahoujin Guru Guru franchise to receive an official English release. Characters =Main characters= ; : :Nike (pronounced Nee-kay) is the protagonist. Nike's father Bado had always wished to be a Hero but, due to the lack of any great evil to fight against, he had to give his dream up. Still, he made his son undergo hard training as a child in hopes that one day a great evil would arise and Nike could fight it. Because of this Nike is a competent, although cowardly, fighter; like Kukuri he is initially immature and inexperienced. Nike is from Jimina Mura (which translates to Plain Old Village). Initially Nike wants to be a Wizard as he finds the thought of casting a fireball \\"cool\\", though his parents convince him to choose the Hero. He initially thinks that he is of the Hero class, as do others. It is later revealed that he is a Thief. Despite this he can use all the abilities of the Hero class, including Gallant Pose, which only a Hero can do. :; : ::Bado is Nike's father. He received a critical hit in the form of a punch the first time he held the infant Nike. After that he trained Nike to be a Hero. Right before the departs for Kodai castle he offers him his old helmet. The helmet is cracked, but Nike suggests he will wear it by tilting it to the side. Bado kicks Nike into the air and keeps the helmet saying that he looks like a gang leader. :; ::Rena is Nike's mother. She knocks out Nike with a poison dart when he tries to flee. She cooks him a meal that resembles an adventuring map. Nike has to eat things in the proper order, which he does not, and ends up poisoned. ; Kukuri with her Meke Meke robe and her old staff : :Kukuri is a gentle-hearted magic apprentice. She has grown under the care of Jimuna Town's old witch, who received her when she was a baby from a wandering stranger, supposedly the last member of the Migu Migu Tribe. Being the last remaining member of the Migu Migu, Kukuri learns the dark summoning magic only the Migu Migu can use known as Guru Guru; it consists of drawing circles on the ground with a staff. She is eager and shows great affection towards Nike, almost always calling him \\"Mr. Hero\\" (Yusha in Japanese). She is extremely lucky or good in several sports and games such as rock-paper- scissors and cricket. She becomes very angry when someone says anything about her appearance: When she was steaming nervously, she got very angry when Nike called her a steamed octopus; she almost killed a monster who called her fat when she was dressed up like a Meke Meke. :Old Witch ::An old woman who raised Kukuri. She is called obaba (old hag) and cow by Kukuri. She lied to Kukuri that chocolate is poison to children to keep her from eating hers. =Rivals= ;Ena :She is a beautiful Wizard who is in love with Gail. She is dressed like a belly dancer. ;Gail :He is a Fighter that thinks he is a Hero. Despite Gail's level, he loses most battles, even one with Nike the first time they met. Gail and Ena reveal that they usually do not have enough money to buy food as they use it to buy equipment; it is they reason they lose all the time. =Others= ;Kita Kita Oyaji :Voiced by Kenichi Ogata (1994-2000), Katsuyuki Konishi (2017) :Oyaji (real name Udberg Eldol), or \\"Old Man\\", used to be the mayor of Kitano, also called North Town. When the town's traditional dance Kita Kita could no longer be performed because no more girls were born, he started dancing it himself. He believes that this was the result of a curse as they had commercialized the dance. His dance is often regarded as creepy and disgusting by the other characters. He usually follows the duo of Nike and Kukuri around. He wears a hula dress and usually finds some excuse to perform his Kita Kita dance, much to Nike and Kukuri's dismay. Apparently he wants to pass on the Kita Kita dance to the next generation and is looking for trainees. In \\"Doki Doki Legend\\" it is learned he developed muscles from all the dancing and is able to defeat monsters in one punch by accident. He has enormous Hit Points (a staggering 1650 in the \\"Pickle of Happiness\\") that makes him nearly immortal and capable to sustain extreme levels of abuse (that is inflicted upon him all the time). ;Toma :Voiced by Yukiyo Fujii (2017) :He joins the party and meets Nike and Kukuri in North village where he pretends to be of the Priest class. In \\"Doki Doki Legend\\" he plays a major role in Nike's party as a Magical engineer with the ability to invent magical items.

Light magic, Dark magic and Guru Guru which is considered to be Dark magic at first but later revealed to be Free magic. Nike tells old witch that at first he thought that Guru Guru was something Ecchi. Guru Guru has random effects when a spell fails. Light magic has to do with controlling natural forces, Dark magic with controlling unnatural forces and creatures and Guru Guru mostly has to do with summoning. The spells cast by Kukuri gain power-ups in effects and certain changes in appearance as she increases her level and knowledge of Guru Guru. *Manifest gas, =Guru Guru= *Lizard's tail Requires Fire circle symbol called Tora (Kukuri mistakes it for Taura when the first time she tries to show magic to Nike and creates a strange but harmless monster).

Everything the target attempts fails and his words make no sense. The spell also provides a dome of protection prior to the arrival of the fairies in the same way as Bemu Bemu Guardian dome does. *Smiling Giant (minor spell) Summons a giant to stand on the horizon. He will smile at the enemy in battle. The spell lasts 3 days. *Special Power-Up (minor spell) This spell will power-up an ally standing in the circle.

The commemorative tenth failed spell summons Octo-Tim, who transforms Kukuri into Devil-Kukuri. *Seal Magic Circle (minor spell) Also called one-minute seal, this level three spell causes a large bandage to fall from the sky and immobilize the enemy. Depending on the level of the caster, the seal lasts from one minute to three hundred years, and gives the caster the chance to escape. =Light Magic= *Gallant Pose This can only be done by someone of the Hero class(although Nike has been able to use it even though he is a Thief).

Its color varies according to the user. The user can fly and is protected from attacks. *Kira Kira sword A magic sword that has a large amount of strength and can shoot energy slashes.

Most blades are useless; however, some are useful, like the Kira Kira Old Man Sword and the Kira Kira School Cuckoo Sword. *Wind sword *Fire sword *Earth sword *Water sword *Kira Kira Old man sword This was an accident created when Nike was trying to form the Kira Kira sword. Kita Kita Oyaji fell on Nike's hand when he was forming the sword, resulting in the Old man's energy being mixed with the sword's and the sword's tip being Old man's head. Whoever is hit by the sword is forced to dance the Kita Kita Dance. =Dark Magic= *Golden Hammer Media =First anime series= The first series \\"Mahoujin Guru Guru\\" (produced by Nippon Animation) has 45 episodes.

Currently, a remake of this movie in English, to star Miss Universe 1994 Sushmita Sen, Clint Eastwood, and Barbra Streisand, is planned by 2021. It was replaced by Aishwarya Rai and Meryl Streep.  Plot  Paul and H√©l√®ne, a wealthy Parisian couple, are preparing to go out for the evening. While driving, they see three men chasing a prostitute down the street. She begs them to save her by letting her into the car, but Paul locks the doors and drives away as the three men savagely beat her, leaving her unconscious in the street. He refuses to let H√©l√®ne phone an ambulance, afraid of being charged with not helping a person in danger (which is a crime in France). H√©l√®ne cannot forget the incident, and the next day she goes to the hospital, where she finds the prostitute, No√©mie, in a coma. Moved, H√©l√®ne stops work and leaves her family responsibilities to stay with No√©mie throughout her recovery, aiding her as she regains mobility and helping her to communicate since she can't yet speak. When one of the pimps returns to threaten and beat No√©mie again into submission, H√©l√®ne follows him out of the hospital, knocks him unconscious with a wooden plank, and leaves him for the police to find. Meanwhile, Paul and H√©l√®ne's son Fabrice, a university student, is cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, who is pregnant. When his girlfriend discovers the truth, she destroys his apartment. He moves into Paul's apartment just as H√©l√®ne moves out, and the two girls follow him, much to Paul's chagrin. When H√©l√®ne returns home for a day, one of No√©mie's pimps goes to the hospital with a friend and removes No√©mie under the pretense that they are relatives taking her for a walk. No√©mie, who still cannot speak, is unable to protest. Realising what has happened, H√©l√®ne follows them, accosts the pimps on the street, and takes No√©mie to Paul's mother's house. There, No√©mie recovers her ability to talk, and explains her life story: Her name is actually Malika, and she is a child of poor French-Algerian immigrants. At 17, her father attempted to sell her into an arrange marriage and she fled. She was picked up by a pimp, named Touki, on the street and he subsequently sold her into sexual slavery and had her hooked on heroin. She convinced Touki to move to Paris to speak to her step-mother and retrieve her passport. Her family kicked her out, and she formed plans to leave her life of forced prostitution behind. She sobered up and opened up an account with her sister, Zora's passport to put some money behind. She tried going to SOS Racisme for help, but she was dismissed. She moved to Geneva and seduced a rich man and conned him into giving her all of his money and jewelry, just before he died. She and Touki returned to Paris with the money. However, the rich man's family went to the press with claims that their money was stolen from the bank. Her pimps found out that she laundered the money for herself and beat her into signing a proxy. She escaped, with Touki and the other two pimps chasing after her, which was when H√©l√®ne and her husband came across her in their car at the beginning. The two women plan Malika's freedom and revenge on her abusers. H√©l√®ne tells Malika that her husband was the one who locked the doors of their car during her attack, but Malika doesn't care. Later, she manages to distract Paul at the Basel airport, who looking for his H√©l√®ne, and has sex with him. All three manage to get on the same flight back to Paris, with Malika keeping her distance, in order to avoid the police. H√©l√®ne finally stands up to the selfishness of her husband and son. Paul falls madly in love with Malika, going insane when she doesn't call. Fabrice also meets and falls in love with her. H√©l√®ne and Malika set up the pimps and their gang to be arrested by the police. Touki is shot after trying to escape. Malika returns to her estranged family and tells her sister, Zora, that she will be forced into marriage as soon as she's old enough, just as Malika was at her age. To save her from a life of patriarchal misery, she begs her sister to come with her to live in freedom, but she refuses, saying she loves them. Malika meets up with Paul again and she takes him to his mother's house. When Zora is beaten by her sexist brothers, her father reveals that she will indeed be married to an older man soon. Malika and H√©l√®ne rush to Marseilles and stop Malika's father from sending Zora off to a forced marriage. Her father curses her and she replies that it is the first time he has ever given her anything. The film ends with Malika, H√©l√®ne, Zora and Paul's mother sitting on a bench gazing at the sun.

Its pronotum is black, with two connected white marks at the front of its head. Range C. novemnotata has historically been native in North America to the United States and southern Canada. C. novemnotata has become rare across its native range. It was once the most commonly collected coccinellid in the northeastern United States until the early 1990s with the last individuals collected for Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware between 1986 and 1988, and another collection in Maine in 1992. Another specimen would not be collected in northeastern states until 14 years later in 2006. More recently, C. novemnotata has only been collected sporadically in the Midwest and west coast of the United States. Decline Invasive coccinellid species such as Harmonia axyridis are sometimes associated with the decline of C. novemnotata, but the species was becoming rare some in areas before the introduction and population increase of invasive lady beetles. Changing agricultural habitats have also been considered as another possible explanation, but recent studies do not suggest a correlation between C. novemnotata densities and land-use change.

Ash, 422 U.S. 66 (1975), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court determined whether a court may imply a cause of action from a criminal statute.  Background  Defendant/petitioner Stewart S. Cort, chairman of the board of directors of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, published a series of political advertisements in nineteen local newspapers where the company had plants, as well as several national publications (including Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report). The advertisements were in support of the business community, asserting that an allegation (supposedly made by 1972 Presidential candidate George McGovern) that big business was not paying its fair share of taxes was untrue, and suggesting that people mobilize ‚Äútruth squads‚Äù to spread this idea. The funding for these ads came from Bethlehem's general corporate funds. The plaintiff/respondent was a shareholder of Bethlehem, and a qualified voter. He sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, on behalf of both himself and the corporation (a derivative suit). He sued under both (a criminal statute forbidding corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with Presidential elections), and the corporate law of the state of Delaware. He then amended his complaint to drop the state law claim, after he declined to post $35,000 in security for expenses in order to proceed with the claim. The District Court held that the criminal penalties of the federal statute did not include any private cause of action, and granted summary judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that because the plaintiff sought money damages for the corporation, that a private cause of action was proper. Issue Could the court properly assume a private cause of action for damages against corporate directors under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 610? Decision Justice William J. Brennan wrote for a unanimous Court. He found that because ¬ß 610 was a criminal statute, and because at the time suit was filed, there was no provision for civil enforcement of the statute, there was no need to imply a private cause of action. Furthermore, a statute enacted in 1974 amended the Federal Election Campaign Act to create the Federal Election Commission, which was granted primary jurisdiction over such complaints. Because of this intervening law, the Court chose to apply the law which was in effect at the time the case was commenced. Brennan also laid out four factors for determining when a cause of action should be implied from a statute: #Is the plaintiff within the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted (i.e., does the statute create a federal right in the plaintiff's favor)? #Is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create or deny a cause of action? #Is it consistent with the underlying purposes of legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? #Is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area specifically of concern to the states, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law? 422 U.S. at 78. Here, the Court found that there was no legislative indication that private cause of action was intended by Congress, or that the plaintiffs in this action were within the class sought to be benefited by the statute. Brennan commented that the intent to protect corporate shareholders ‚Äúwas at best a subsidiary purpose‚Äù of the statute. 422 U.S. at 80. He also found that implying a cause of action was inconsistent with the statute's purpose, and that the plaintiff had a remedy under state corporate law. Thus, the Third Circuit's decision was overturned. These factors were also used in the case of Cannon v. University of Chicago, .

History The village was initially populated by coal miners and later grew as an overspill/commuter town for workers in Musselburgh and Edinburgh. A tribute to the miners can be found marked on a stone through the main road (Salters Road) of the village. A coal mine at Wallyford was worked for the profit of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1563 and also supplied coal for her own fire at Holyrood Palace.Gordon Donaldson, Thirds of Benefices (SHS, Edinburgh, 1949), pp. 146, 156. The village is overlooked by the restored Fa'side Castle which was destroyed by the English after the Battle of Pinkie in 1546. In 2016, construction began to regenerate the village. A new, replacement Primary School was completed in February 2019. A new village high street/centre will be created alongside a legible hierarchy of roads and footpaths, maximising connections throughout but in particular to the Village Centre and Community Woodland. Landmarks Wallyford has a railway station with a Park and Ride facility, on the Edinburgh to North Berwick railway line, operated by ScotRail. It has a primary/nursery school, playgroup, community centre, churches, library, post office and a Miners' social club.

It is a sodium channel blocker and therefore classified as a Class 1a anti-arrhythmic agent. Disopyramide has a negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium, significantly decreasing the contractility. Disopyramide also has an anticholinergic effect on the heart which accounts for many adverse side effects. Disopyramide is available in both oral and intravenous forms, and has a low degree of toxicity.  Mechanism of action  Disopyramide's Class 1a activity is similar to that of quinidine in that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction. Disopyramide depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity. Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration. This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium.Hulting J, Rosenhamer G: Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of disopyramide in patients with ventricular arrhythmia. Acta Med Scand 199:41-51, 1976. As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure. Levites proposed a possible secondary mode of action for disopyramide, against reentrant arrhythmias after an ischemic insult. Disopyramide decreases the inhomogeneity between infarcted and normal myocardium refractory periods; in addition to lengthening the refractory period. This decreases the chance of re-entry depolarization, because signals are more likely to encounter tissue in a refractory state which cannot be excited.Guyton, Arthur C., Hall, John E. (2006). Textbook of Medical Physiology (11th ed.). Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders. This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes.Katzung, Bertram G., Masters, Susan B., Trevor, Anthony J. (2009). Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (11th ed.). New York: McGraw Hill Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease, occurring in 1:500 individuals in the general population. It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release is the most potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms. Disopyramide has been actively used for more than 30 years. Disopyramide administration for obstructive HCM has a IIa recommendation in the 2011 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guidelines for treatment of obstructive HCM. A IIa treatment recommendation indicates that benefits outweigh risk, and that it is reasonable to administer treatment. Negative inotropes improve LV obstruction by decreasing LV ejection acceleration and hydrodynamic forces on the mitral valve. Disopyramide's particular efficacy is due to its potent negative inotropic effects; in head-to-head comparison, it is more effective for gradient reduction than either beta-blocker or verapamil.Kajimoto K, Imai T, Minami Y, Kasanuki H. Comparison of acute reduction in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by disopyramide versus pilsicainide versus cibenzoline. Am J Cardiol. 2010;106:1307-1312 Disopyramide is most often administered with beta-blockade. When used in patients resistant to beta- blockade, disopyramide is effective in 60% of cases, reducing symptoms and gradient to the extent that invasive procedures such as surgical septal myectomy are not required. Disopyramide, despite its efficacy, has one main side effect that has limited its use in the US, though it has seen wider application in Canada, UK and Japan. Vagal blockade predictably causes dry mouth, and in men with prostatism, may cause urinary retention. Teichman et al. showed that pyridostigmine used in combination with disopyramide substantially alleviates vagolytic side effects without compromising antiarrhythmic efficacy. This combination has also been shown to be effective and safe in obstructive HCM in a large cohort of patients. Some clinicians prescribe pyridostigmine sustained release (marketed in the US as Mestinon Timespan) to every patient begun on disopyramide.Sherrid MV, Arabadjian M. A primer of disopyramide treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 2012;54:483-492 This combination increases acceptance of higher disopyramide dosing, important since there is a dose-response correlation in obstructive HCM, higher doses yielding lower gradients. Another concern about disopyramide has been the hypothetical potential for inducing sudden death from its type 1 anti-arrhythmic effects. However, a multicenter registry and two recent cohort registries have largely reduced this concern, by showing sudden death rates lower than that observed from the disease itself. These concerns about the drug must be viewed from the clinical perspective that disopyramide is generally the last agent that is tried for patients before they are referred for invasive septal reduction with surgical septal myectomy (an open-heart operation) or alcohol septal ablation (a controlled heart attack). Both of these invasive procedures have risk of morbidity and mortality. For selected patients, a trial of oral disopyramide is a reasonable approach before proceeding to invasive septal reduction. Patients who respond to disopyramide are continued on the drug. Those who continue to have disabling symptoms or who experience side effects are promptly referred for septal reduction. Using such a stepped strategy, investigators have reported that survival does not differ from that observed in the age-matched normal United States population.

In 1968, it was fitted to the high-performance Mercedes- Benz 300SEL 6.3 sports sedan. The engine was enlarged to in 1975 for the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 (1975-1981). The M100 featured a cast iron block, aluminum alloy heads, and aircraft-style sodium-filled valves operating against hardened valve seats. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were forged instead of cast. Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 of which were under full load. As introduced, it utilized a mechanical fuel injection system designed and built in-house by Daimler-Benz.

Biblical mentions In one case, Havilah is associated with the Garden of Eden, that mentioned in the Book of Genesis (2:10-11): In addition to the region described in chapter 2 of Genesis, two individuals named Havilah are listed in the Table of Nations. The Table lists the descendants of Noah, who are considered eponymous ancestors of nations. Besides the name mentioned in , another is mentioned in the Books of Chronicles (). One person is the son of Cush, the son of Ham. The other person is a son of Joktan and descendant of Shem. The name Havilah appears in , where it defines the territory inhabited by the Ishmaelites as being \\"from Havilah to Shur, opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria\\"; and in the Books of Samuel (), which states that king Saul smote the Amalekites who were living there, except for King Agag, whom he took prisoner. One passage mentions Israelites being sent to Assyria and Halah. According to the monk Antoine Augustin Calmet, Halah most likely indicates Havilah. Extra-biblical mentions In extra-biblical literature, the land of Havilah is mentioned in Pseudo-Philo as the source of the precious jewels that the Amorites used in fashioning their idols in the days after Joshua, when Kenaz was judge over the Israelites. There is an extra-biblical tradition found in the Kitab al-Magall (Clementine literature) and the Cave of Treasures. According to this tale, in the early days after the Tower of Babel, the children of Havilah, son of Joktan built a city and kingdom, which was near to those of his brothers, Sheba and Ophir. Possible location Several locations for Havilah are shown W. W. M√ºller, in the 1992 Anchor Bible Dictionary, holds that the \\"Havilah\\" of Genesis 2 must refer to a region in southwest Arabia.M√ºller, W. W. (1992). \\"Havilah (Place).\\" In the Anchor Bible Dictionary. Volume 3, p. 82. He locates the reference to a \\"Havilah\\" in Genesis 25:18 as referring to a northern Arabian location. Some have said Havilah were of Cushite background who colonized Arabia, even linking them with the Macrobians. Saadia Gaon's tenth- century Arabic translation of the Hebrew Bible substitutes Havilah with Zeila in present day Somalia. Benjamin Tudela, the twelfth-century Jewish traveler, claimed Zeila was the land of Havilah confined by Al-Habash on the west. Zeila (Havilah) had been sacked by the Portuguese governor of Old Goa, Lopo Soares de Albergaria, while its Harla chief Mahfuz invaded Abyssinia in 1517. In 1844, Charles Forster argued that a trace of the ancient name Havilah could still be found in the use of Aval for what is now known as Bahrain Island.Forster, Charles (1844). The Historical Geography of Arabia. Vol 1, pp. 40-41. Augustus Henry Keane believed that the land of Havilah was centered on Great Zimbabwe and was roughly contemporaneous with what was then Southern Rhodesia.The Gold of Ophir - Whence Brought and by Whom?

The genus has been placed within the subclass Phyllocarida, in the class Malacostraca that includes shrimps and lobsters. The organism Canadaspis had claws on the end of its frontal appendages which may have been used to stir up sediment, or to scrape off the top layer, which may have been a nutritious layer of microbes. Large particles it stirred up would have been captured by spines on the inside of its legs; these spines would have directed the food particles to the organism's mouth, where it used its mandibles to grind larger particles. Its antennae served a sensory function. Spines on its head probably served to protect its vulnerable eyes from predators. Its limbs probably moved in sequence to produce a rippling motion. Although Canadaspis probably did not swim, this could have helped propel the organism from under soft sediments. The appendages also produced currents which would have helped with feeding and respiration. Canadaspis is very closely related to the similar organism Perspicaris, differing only in morphological detail. Classification of Canadaspis Three alternatives exist for Canadaspis's classification. They concern its relationship to the crustacea; it was originally thought that it falls within that clade, but this no longer appears to be the case. The alternatives are that it is a stem group crustacean, but others believe it is more basal still, falling in the base of the Euarthropoda. It is currently thought to be a member of the group Hymenocarina, which are interpreted as mandibulate stem-crustaceans. Fossil occurrences Canadapsis perfecta, the type species, comes from the Cambrian- age Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada. Canadaspis are also found in different formations of the House Range of western Utah as well as the Pioche Shale of Nevada. Canadaspis laevigata, coming from the Chengjiang biota and thus some 10 million years older than Canadapsis perfecta, is an equivocal member of the genus. Some scientists believe Canadaspis laevigata to be a more primitive Crustaceomorpha antecedent of Canadaspis, and others consider it a bi-valved arthropod of uncertain affinity.

Minimal surfaces are among the objects of study in geometric analysis. Geometric analysis is a mathematical discipline where tools from differential equations, especially elliptic partial differential equations are used to establish new results in differential geometry and differential topology. The use of linear elliptic PDEs dates at least as far back as Hodge theory. More recently, it refers largely to the use of nonlinear partial differential equations to study geometric and topological properties of spaces, such as submanifolds of Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds, and symplectic manifolds. This approach dates back to the work by Tibor Rad√≥ and Jesse Douglas on minimal surfaces, John Forbes Nash Jr. on isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space, work by Louis Nirenberg on the Minkowski problem and the Weyl problem, and work by Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov and Aleksei Pogorelov on convex hypersurfaces. In the 1980s fundamental contributions by Karen Uhlenbeck,Jackson, Allyn. (2019). Founder of geometric analysis honored with Abel Prize Retrieved 20 March 2019. Clifford Taubes, Shing-Tung Yau, Richard Schoen, and Richard Hamilton launched a particularly exciting and productive era of geometric analysis that continues to this day. A celebrated achievement was the solution to the Poincar√© conjecture by Grigori Perelman, completing a program initiated and largely carried out by Richard Hamilton. Scope The scope of geometric analysis includes both the use of geometrical methods in the study of partial differential equations (when it is also known as \\"geometric PDE\\"), and the application of the theory of partial differential equations to geometry. It incorporates problems involving curves and surfaces, or domains with curved boundaries, but also the study of Riemannian manifolds in arbitrary dimension. The calculus of variations is sometimes regarded as part of geometric analysis, because differential equations arising from variational principles have a strong geometric content.

Born in Ireland, Hickey came to America as a soldier in the British Army and fought as personal assistant to Major General William Johnson in the Seven Years' War, but later joined the Patriot cause when the American Revolution broke out. He became part of the Life Guard, which protected General George Washington, his staff, and the Continental Army's payroll. Hickey was jailed for passing counterfeit money. He was later tried and executed for mutiny and sedition, and he may have been involved in an assassination plot against Washington in 1776. Washington made a general announcement: > The unhappy fate of Thomas Hickey, executed this day for mutiny, sedition, > and treachery, the General hopes will be a warning to every soldier in the > Army to avoid those crimes, and all others, so disgraceful to the character > of a soldier, and pernicious to his country, whose pay he receives and bread > he eats. And in order to avoid those crimes, the most certain method is to > keep out of the temptation of them, and particularly to avoid lewd women, > who, by the dying confession of this poor criminal, first led him into > practices which ended in an untimely and ignominious death.Washington's > general order, June 28, 1776 in Conspiracy In April 1776, after the conclusion of the Boston campaign, General Washington and the Continental Army marched to New York City and prepared for an anticipated assault on the city by the British Army. The Royal Governor of New York, William Tryon, had been driven out of the city by revolutionary forces and was compelled to seek refuge on a ship in New York Harbor. Nevertheless, the city had many Loyalist residents who favored the British side. Thomas Hickey was a private in the Commander-in-Chief's Guard, a unit formed on March 12, 1776, to protect George Washington, his official papers, and the Continental Army's cash. That spring, Hickey and another soldier were arrested for passing counterfeit money. While incarcerated in Bridewell prison, Hickey revealed to another prisoner, Isaac Ketchum, that he was part of a wider conspiracy of soldiers who were prepared to defect to the British once the expected invasion came.Freeman, Douglas S. George Washington: A Biography. 7 vols. New York: Scribners, 1948‚Äì57, 4:119. Arrested by civilian authorities, Hickey was turned over to the Continental Army for trial. He was court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny and sedition. He was hanged on June 28, 1776, at the corner of Chrystie and Grand Streets before a crowd of 20,000 spectators in New York. Hickey was the only person put on trial for the conspiracy. During the trial, David Mathews, the Mayor of New York City and a Loyalist, was accused of funding the operation to bribe soldiers to join the British. Although the charge was never proven, Mathews and 12 others were briefly imprisoned. The initial plan was alleged to include plans to kidnap Washington, assassinate his officers, and blow up the Continental Army's ammunition magazines. These rumors greatly damaged the reputation of Loyalists throughout the nascent United States. =Military rank= In the transcript of Court Martial for the Trial of Thomas Hickey and Others on June 26, 1776, Hickey is referred to as a \\"private sentinel\\" in Washington's Life Guards, under the command of \\"Maj. Gibbs\\". There is reason to suspect this transcript is a copy made shortly after the end of the Revolutionary War when many official papers were being copied for preservation. In Harry Ward's George Washington's Enforcers (2006), he gives Hickey's rank as sergeant, and notes that Captain Caleb Gibbs was not promoted to major until June 29, 1778, two years after Hickey's trial.Ward, Harry M. George Washington's Enforcers: Policing the Continental Army. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001. Chapt. 5, \\"Washington's Life Guard\\". p. 60. When enlisted soldiers are convicted, it is normal for their punishment to include a reduction to the lowest rank, private. A postwar transcript would explain why Hickey is listed at his lowest rank and Gibbs is identified at his highest rank. Assassination plot Richmond Hill (built c. 1760, demolished 1849) Washington's headquarters from May to June 1776 was at Richmond Hill, a suburban villa outside the city. Samuel Fraunces, a tavern keeper whose establishment was about two miles away, provided meals for the general and his officers. Washington hired a housekeeper, a 72-year-old widow named Elizabeth Thompson, who worked at Richmond Hill from June 1776 to December 1781.Papers of George Washington. Revolutionary War Series, Volume 5, ed. Philander D. Chase [Charlottesville; London: University Press of Virginia, 1993], p. 132n.In a 1783 letter to his aide, Washington asks to be remembered to Samuel Fraunces, and writes: \\"Pray let me know whether old Mrs. Thompson (our former Housekeeper) is in Town or not.\\" Gen.

Although Hickey was jailed for passing counterfeit money, and then charged with sedition and conspiracy while in prison, William Spohn Baker, a late 19th-century Washingtonian, believed that the real reason for his execution was involvement in a plot to kill or kidnap Washington: > Thomas Hickey, one of Washington's Guard, was tried by a court-martial and > sentenced to death, being found implicated in a plot to murder the American > general officers on the arrival of the British, or at best to capture > Washington and deliver him to Sir William Howe. The plot had been traced to > Governor Tryon, the mayor (David Mathews) having been a principal agent > between him and the persons concerned in it.William Spohn Baker, Itinerary > of General Washington from June 15, 1775, to December 23, 1783 > (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1892), p. 41. Baker was wrong about the specific crimes of which Hickey was convicted, but in 1776 there was a real rumor of an assassination plot: Two other contemporaneous references to an assassination plot have been published.Peter T. Curtenius to Richard Varick, New York, June 22, 1776, quoted in Robert Hughes' George Washington (New York: 1927), p. 392; and Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnson, Philadelphia, July 8, 1776, in William Powell, ed., Correspondence of William Tryon 2 (1768-1818) (Raleigh, NC: 1981), p. 862. A garbled account of an assassination attempt appeared over two years later in a provincial English newspaper, The Ipswich Journal, on October 31, 1778: > Advise is received from America that two persons, a man and a woman who > lived as servants with General Washing ton , have been executed in the > presence of the army for conspiring to poison their master. =Fraunces' petition to Congress= Fraunces Tavern Museum, New York City In a March 5, 1785, sworn petition to the U.S. Congress, Samuel Fraunces claimed that it was he who discovered the assassination plot, that he was falsely accused of being part of it and was jailed until his name was cleared. He wrote (in the third person): > That he [Fraunces] was the Person that first discovered the Conspiracy which > was formed in the Year 1776 against the Life of his Excellency General > Washington and that the Suspicions Which were Entertained of his agency in > that Important Discovery occasioned [sic, occasioned] a public Enquiry after > he was made a Prisoner on which the want of positive Proof alone preserved > his Life.\\"Memorials Addressed to Congress, 1775-88\\", Papers of the > Continental Congress, Record Group 360, M.247, Reel 49, National Archives, > Washington, D.C.

Papers of the Continental Congress, National Archives, Washington, D.C. Phoebe Fraunces legend Martha Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, died in 1857. Two years later, his daughter, Mary Anna Custis Lee, published his memoirs, to which were added extended notes by the antiquarian Benson J. Lossing. One of these notes told the story of an attempt by Hickey to poison Washington: > When Washington and his army occupied the city, in the summer of 1776, the > chief resided at Richmond Hill, a little out of town, afterward the seat of > Aaron Burr. [Samuel] Fraunces's daughter was Washington's housekeeper, and > she saved his life on one occasion, by exposing the intentions of Hickey, > one of the Life-Guard (already mentioned), who was about to murder the > general, by putting poison in a dish of peas prepared for his table.George > Washington Parke Custis and Benson J. Lossing, Private Memoirs of Washington > (New York: Edgewood Publishing Co, 1859), p. 411. Custis' actual memoirs did not contain the story‚Äîit was added by Lossing‚Äîbut this distinction is easy for the reader to miss. Lossing repeated the story in an 1870 book, claiming that Washington's housekeeper had testified at Hickey's court-martial: Lossing's information was third-hand (as he freely admitted). This story is undermined by the trial minutes of Hickey's court-martial, which contain no housekeeper's testimony. In the January 1876 issue of Scribner's Monthly, John F. Mines repeated Lossing's story and identified the housekeeper. This was more than 99 years after Hickey's execution and was the first time that the name \\"Phoebe Fraunces\\" appeared in print. Mines listed no sources for the magazine article. It was nationally read in the patriotic build-up to the 1876 Centennial celebration: > A daughter of \\"Black Sam\\", Phoebe Fraunces, was Washington's housekeeper > when he had his headquarters in New York in the spring of 1776, and was the > means of defeating a conspiracy against his life. Its immediate agent was to > be Thomas Hickey, a deserter from the British army, who had become a member > of Washington's bodyguard, and had made himself a general favorite at > headquarters. Fortunately, the would-be conspirator fell desperately in love > with Phoebe Fraunces, and made her his confidant. She revealed the plot to > her father, and at an opportune moment the denouement came. Hickey was > arrested and tried by court-martial.John F. Mines, \\"New York in the > Revolution,\\" Scribner's Monthly, vol. XI, no. 3 (January 1876), p. 311. In 1919, Henry Russell Drowne (great-grandson of Dr. Solomon Drowne, the 1776 chronicler above) repeated the Phoebe Fraunces legend in his history of Fraunces Tavern: > His [Samuel Fraunces's] daughter Phoebe was Washington's housekeeper in the > Mortier House on Richmond Hill, occupied by the Commander-in-Chief as > Headquarters, in June, 1776, and it was she who revealed the plot to > assassinate Generals Washington and Putnam, which led to the apprehension of > her lover, an Irishman named Thomas Hickey, a British deserter, then a > member of Washington's bodyguard, in consequence of which he was promptly > executed on June 28, 1776. Drowne, H.R. A Sketch of Fraunces Tavern, p. 8. =Legend refuted= There is no record of Samuel Fraunces having had a daughter named Phoebe. The name does not appear with those of his children in the baptismal records of Christ Church, Philadelphia, or Trinity Church, New York. His will, dated September 11, 1795, also does not mention a \\"Phoebe\\".Philadelphia county records, proven October 22, 1795, Will book X page 348 It is well documented that Fraunces' nickname was \\"Black Sam\\",\\"At first we supposed it was only a sham,/Till he drove a round ball thro' the roof of black Sam-\\", The Poems of Philip Freneau, Written Chiefly During the Late War (1786) p. 321. This refers to the August 23, 1775, night bombardment of Lower Manhattan by the British frigate Asia. Fraunces Tavern was hit by a cannonball. but the 1790 U.S. Census for New York lists him as a \\"Free white male\\" and a slaveholder.Heads of Families, First Census of the United States: 1790, State of New York (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, reprinted 1908), p. 117. New York tax records list both slaves and indentured servants in his household,G. Kurt Piehler, \\"Samuel Fraunces,\\" American National Biography (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), vol. 8, pp. 414-15. and he advertised the sale of a slave in a New York newspaper.The Royal Gazette, August 29, 1778. If a \\"Phoebe\\" ever existed, she may have been a servant employed or enslaved by Fraunces, rather than his daughter. Self- published author Charles L. Blockson states that \\"Phoebe\\" was the nickname of Fraunces' eldest daughter Elizabeth, but he provides no evidence to support this claim.Elizabeth Fraunces as \\"Phoebe\\" If the woman in the legend had been Elizabeth Fraunces, she would have been rather young for wartime espionage or a clandestine love affair. Elizabeth's birth date of December 26, 1765,Records of Christ Church, Philadelphia, list Elizabeth Fraunces' birth, 26 December 1765, baptism, January 27, 1766. means that at the time of Hickey's execution, she was 10 years old.

He finished his higher school education at Breslau's Maria-Magdalen grammar school. In 1667 he became a student of theology at the University of Jena, and on 30 November 1673 was ordained as a priest, having been requested as a traveling chaplain for Prince Christian, the son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha. On his return home, following a two- year journey through western Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy, and southern France, he became a court-chaplain at Altenburg, and married the daughter of J. J. Rabe, physician in ordinary to the prince of Saxe- Friedenstein. In 1678 he was made the deacon of St. Maria-Magdalen in Breslau and became pastor in 1689. Later career In 1680 he published his prayer- book under the title Kern aller Gebete in Jena. In 1689 he became vicar of St. Maria Magdalen, Breslau. His observations on the city's mortality rates resulted in the treatise ‚ÄúReflexionen √ºber Leben und Tod bey denen in Breslau Geborenen und Gestorbenen‚Äù which he finally sent to Leibniz ‚Äì the covering letter is documented, the text itself is lost. Leibniz seems to have informed the Royal Society of Neumann's work. The society's secretary Henri Justel invited Neumann in 1691 to provide the Society with the data he had collected. Neumann's mail is lost, Edmond Halley's computations digesting Neumann's data have, however, survived ‚Äì published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of 1693. In 1697 Neumann was appointed inspector of the Protestant schools and churches of Breslau. He eventually became vicar of St. Elisabeth and professor of theology at both the city's grammar schools. Neumann influenced Johann Christian Kundmann (1684‚Äì1751), who later published the first German comparative study of mortality rates in the Sammlung von Natur- Medizin- sowie auch dazu geh√∂rigen Kunst- und Litteraturgeschichten (1718) ff. Neumann left a legacy of more than 30 hymns, many of which were included in Burg‚Äôs Gesang Buch (Breslau: 1746) and in the ninth edition of the Breslau Vollst√§ndige Kirchen-und Haus-Music (circa 1700)Cyberhymnal He was also known for his theory that the individual Hebrew letters had \\"hieroglyphic\\" meanings.

Around 1712, Isaac Newton wrote to Neumann, acknowledging receipt of his book, Clavis Domus Heber, and congratulating him on the endeavor, but professing himself insufficiently skilled in Hebrew to make a responsible judgment as to its success.The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, ed.

The measurements were first used by L.C. Vincent, a French hydrologist, in the early 1900s. It is often associated with homeopathy and holistic health. The usefulness of the test is debatable and according to physician Stephen Barrett BTA is outdated, apart from pH measurement, is an inferior assessment technique that should not be favored over more modern techniques.  Usefulness  Proponents of the BTA claim that comparing the pH, resistivity, and redox of the blood, urine, and saliva provides a health practitioner an indication of the metabolic processes taking place inside the body. There is no scientific evidence that these measurements provide a medically relevant indication of metabolic processes. Multiple manufacturers of BTA equipment have been prevented from selling their equipment in the United States because they lack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. However, the FDA has not stated whether the BTA is medically useful or not.

CCBBC provides a Bible-based education focusing on Christian service. The college is accredited with the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Association for Biblical Higher Education. CCBBC was founded by Dr. Lloyd Caswell Kelly in 1926. Dr. Donnie Fox has been the President of Clear Creek Baptist Bible College since April 25, 2007. History Roadside view of the campus Dr. L.C. Kelly (1874-1955) was born April 18, 1874 in Choctaw, Alabama to Solomon and Sarah (Felt) Kelly. He became a Southern Baptist preacher at the age of 20, as he furthered his education he pastored many small country churches. He earned a four-year degree at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky. Moving to Louisville, Kentucky at the turn of the twentieth century he became the editor of the Kentucky Issue the Louisville Local newspaper. In 1907 he and Nancy Newland married in Stanford, Kentucky at her father's home. In 1908 Rev. Kelley and his bride moved to Orlinda, Tennessee to take the pastorate at Orlinda Baptist Church. Here Lloyd and Nancy began their family. He and Orlinda Baptist Church started an annual Bible Institution in 1908. After 1910 the family moved to Taylor County, where Kelly began working with the Russell Creek Association of Baptist. The association ran an academy called Russell Creek Academy, which went into financial distress in 1908. Kelly aided in its reopening the school in 1914, and in 1916 began holding higher education classes; it later developed into Campbellsville University. Kelley took the pastorate of the First Baptist Church in Pineville in 1919; here he led prohibition rallies and preached passionately against alcohol. In 1924 while walking the L&N; railway through a pre-civil war tunnel crossing creeks and mountains the voice of God came clear to him. The first meeting was held in 1926, with a two-week schedule. He felt led to start an annual Bible Institute and chartered Clear Creek Mountain Springs, Inc. The institution transformed into Clear Creek Mountain Preacher School and Clear Creek Baptist School during the 1940s and 50s. During the 1920s Clear Spring was used by the Kentucky Baptist as their Camp meeting location, as revivals were held on what is now the main campus and the athletic field. In the 1930s and 40s RA (Royal Ambassadors) and GA (Girls in Action) camps were held for children all over Kentucky. One Child from Pineville, Buddy Albright, announced his call to the mission field at an RA Camp. He later became a Missionary to Africa along with his wife Jean (Flowers) Albright. The campus work study program was an interesting one, with large chicken coops and farming areas, a furniture factory (making pews and pulpit furniture), and RA arrows for archery men could work and provide and study as well. In 1948 Kelly Hall was finished, which housed family and single students as well as offices and a chapel. Kelly Hall still serves today as the male dormitory and cafeteria. Dr. D.M. Aldridge came as President in the 1954 and brought the school into full-time education ministry. The work study program flourished and campus housing improved. In 1982 Dr. Leon Simpson came as president, during that time in 1986 the school received full accreditation. One of the faculty serving at that time was Dr. H. Leo Eddleman (1911-1995), who has served many of our Baptist Schools. He received his PhD from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, after being appointed missionary to Palestine, he returned and began his professorship at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. He went on to become the President of Georgetown College, and New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. He also was employed by the Baptist Sunday School Board. He retired from Clear Creek Baptist Bible College in 1989 and moved back to Louisville, Kentucky. Kentucky Baptist Convention president Bill D. Whitaker became the college's fourth president in 1988. During his tenure, the school became debt-free and constructed a new education center, now known as the Bill D. Whitaker Class Room Building. Donnie Fox replaced Whitaker as president in 2007. The President's home was moved back on campus in the first year of his administration to have better interaction with the campus family. The college continues to operate without debt under his leadership.

Although the minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21 in all states (see National Minimum Drinking Age Act), the legal details for consumption vary greatly. While a few states completely ban alcohol usage for people under 18, the majority have exceptions that permit consumption.Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) State Profiles of Underage Drinking Laws Underage drinking has become an activity primarily done behind closed doors. Typically, underage drinkers hide their alcohol consumption by drinking quickly before they go out, which is often referred to as pregaming or pre- partying. Brittany Levine explained in her article \\"Pre-Gaming\\" in USA Today that \\"of all drinking events involving pre-partying, 80% involved additional drinking afterward.\\" Those who oppose a complete ban on underage drinking argue that it is important that minors be introduced to alcohol in a controlled environment, so that supervision and guidance might occur instead of experimentation. Some parents are willing to provide alcohol for their children if they drink it in a controlled environment. Furnishing alcohol to one's own children is permitted in 31 states, while it's illegal to do so for other people's children in all fifty states. Social host ordinances have been enacted in a number of jurisdictions to attempt to limit the parties where adults may permit minors to drink. Social host laws or ordinances have proliferated in the last ten years because it has been too difficult for law enforcement to prove which adults furnished or served alcohol to minors in their own home, so it permits them to cite or arrest the adult who has control of the premises. Due to the difficulty in proving these cases, some states make this an affirmative defense that the defendant must prove consumption was legally permissible. Drinking age Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their own legislation to increase the drinking age, a federal law had to be implemented to avoid blood borders, or teenagers driving to the nearest state with a lower drinking age. Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. In 2007, the drinking age debate in the United States was renewed when Choose Responsibility began promoting the lowering of the drinking age coupled with education and rules to persuade people to drink responsibly before they are of legal age. Before one is eligible to buy, possess and consume alcohol, an alcohol education class must be completed in its entirety and each teen must pass a final examination before licensing can occur. If a teen has any alcohol-related law violations before they turn 18, they will have a minimum of one year per violation before they are eligible to be licensed.McCardell. http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/proposal/ In 2008, McCardell and the presidents of over 100 U.S. colleges and universities launched the Amethyst Initiative, a campaign to debate the effectiveness of present alcohol laws. In 2008, Gallup reported that 77% of the population over 18 oppose the 18-year drinking age. As it stands, any state that lowers its alcohol purchase or possession age would lose five percent of its federal highway funding. This could range from a $6 million‚Äì150 million loss for any single state. Prevention programs According to Frances M. Harding of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, \\"Our target is to change social norms.\\" =Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students= The Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) program consists of a brief survey given to students to help them assess their alcohol usage against other students. It also consists of one or two counseling sessions granted to the students to provide support and not be confrontational regarding their alcohol use. =\\"Talk. They Hear You\\"= The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration created the \\"Talk. They Hear You\\" campaign that involved a mobile app to assist parents with having conversations about alcohol usage to their children. Motivations To summarize the motivations for underage drinking, cultural norms allow underage drinking while social pressures facilitate them. Although the legal drinking age is set at 21, drinking at age 18 or upon entrance into college is the culturally accepted limit. This cultural permission is the primary reason many college students ignore laws concerning drinking. In addition to cultural motivations, students are socially expected to drink. Often if not always, social gatherings are centered on drinking. Furthermore, besides feeling the need to drink in order to be accepted, alcohol intoxication provides students who may be shy or feel out of their element with enough liquid courage to enjoy themselves. What Drives Underage Drinking? An International Analysis. Rep. International Center for Alcohol Policies, 2004. Web. 7 Mar. 2012. Modlin, Gillian. \\"Underage College Drinking.\\" Telephone interview. 21 Mar. 2012. Arguments Those that are for lowering the drinking age generally argue that the moderate consumption of alcohol frequently as a complement to a meal or drink with friends is preferable to and healthier than the binge drinking habits more often associated with dry countries such as the United States. These opinions generally lead to the argument that it is far more effective and beneficial for laws to monitor, limit, and guide healthy drinking habits rather than to outright ban it. Furthermore, it is argued that alcohol abuse occurs‚Äîat least in part‚Äîas a result of the stringent drinking laws. It is said that if a drinking age wasn't strictly enforced and people below the age of 18 had opportunities to learn how to drink responsibility before college, less teenagers would abuse alcohol. Dwight B. Heath, a Professor at Brown points out the ‚Äòforbidden fruit‚Äô syndrome that is created when the drinking age is so high. In contrast to countries with low drinking ages. \\"Alcohol has no mystique. It's no big deal.‚Äù Many of these proponents also argue that instead of there being a strict age limit, laws should be more gradual with suggestions such as having to take a test to get licensed to drink or implementing laws such as those in Europe that limit the type of alcohols or the setting under which they may be consumed.\\"Drinking and Culture: International Comparisons.\\" Choose Responsibility: Balance, Maturity, Common Sense. Choose Responsibility. Web. 07 Mar. 2012.Fell, James C. \\"WHY 21? Addressing Underage Drinking.\\" MADD. Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Web. 07 Mar. 2012. For those who argue for maintaining and even strengthening current drinking laws, however, citing past examples, generally argue that injuries and deaths related to drinking are bad enough presently. They also argue that initiatives to implement gradual drinking laws or educational programs are optimistic and unrealistic. Furthermore, they propose that drinking and driving related problems are rampant enough among those who are not legally of age and that lowering the drinking age would only enable these habits further, causing an even higher volume of alcohol-related problems.  Statistics  =Rates= SAMHSA Although the incidence of underage drinking is still significant, government, university and national statistics have confirmed that alcohol use and binge drinking among high school students has declined steadily over the past three decades, and continues to decline annually. According to a United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration study involving 30,000 youths aged 12 to 20 years old, between 2002 and 2013 the percentage of underage drinkers declined from 28.8% to 22.7%. Underage binge drinkers decreased 19.3% to 14.2%. A December 2014, study performed by the University of Michigan also found that 75% of senior high school students disapproved of drinking excessively on the weekends. Alcohol still proved to be the favored substance of abuse among American youths however, with tobacco and illicit drugs following in rank. =Alcohol access= A survey of over 6000 teenagers revealed (1): * Teenagers and young adults typically get their alcohol from persons 21 or older. The second most common source for high school students is someone else under age 21, and the third most common source for 18- to 20-year-old adults is buying it from a store, bar or restaurant (despite the fact that such sales are against the law). * In the 12th grade, boys were more likely than girls to buy alcohol from a store, bar or restaurant. * The higher a teenager's weekly income, the more likely he/she will buy alcohol from a store, bar or restaurant. * It is easy to get alcohol at a party and from siblings or others 21 or older. How easy is it for youth to buy alcohol? *When young females attempted to buy beer without an ID at liquor, grocery or convenience stores, 47‚Äì52% of the attempts, beer was sold (1, 2) and nearly 80% of all the stores sold beer to the buyers at least once in three attempts; nearly 25% sold beer all three times.(1) *When young females attempted to buy beer without an ID at bars or restaurants, 50% of the attempts resulted in a sale to the buyer.(2) *When young males and females attempted to buy beer without an ID at community festivals, 50% of the attempts resulted in a sale to the buyer.(3) See also * Alcohol advertising on college campuses * California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control * Legal drinking age controversy in the United States References External links * California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control Shoulder Tap Program * Choose Responsibility * The Century Council: Learn the Facts * MADD Online: Stats & Resources * National Youth Rights Association * SAMHSA's \\"Talk.

The original Shocker was built by PneuVentures and distributed by Smart Parts in the US in 1995. It is now discontinued, but was the first electropneumatic paintball marker on the market at the time. Several revisions of the marker have since been produced.  Shocker Sport (1995-2002)  A first-generation Shocker Sport The first generation Shocker was one of the first mass-produced electropneumatic paintball markers on the market, effectively making it the \\"grandfather\\" of most markers used in tournament paintball today. Its closed bolt, hammerless design operated using two solenoids, rather than a hammer and spring, to open and close the valve and to cycle the bolt independently. Due to its large boxlike shape and significant weight, it was often referred to by the nicknames \\"shoebox\\" and \\"brick\\". The first generation Shocker was manufactured by a company called PneuVentures and sold through Smart Parts. This marker was discontinued in 1997, when Smart Parts redesigned it and began producing the marker in-house until 2002. This marker became known as the Shocker Sport. The Shocker Sport was large, heavy, had a limited firing speed of 11.2 balls per second, and poor air efficiency when compared to other markers from the same time period.  Shocker SFT (2003-2006)  In 2003 Smart Parts released a completely new marker under the name Shocker SFT (Seal Forward Technology). The new Shocker was completely redesigned from the ground-up, and was essentially a new marker compared to the older Shocker Sport. Due to SP marketing it was given the name \\"Shocker\\" since the previous Shockers were discontinued. The Shocker SFT mainly features a single tube, open bolt spool valve design, capable of high firing speeds, and a small body design. It uses Shocker threaded barrels like its predecessor and operates with a pressure of Shocker SFTs had an optional reflective anti- chop Vision eye which was an added accessory until 2006, when it became standard. = Private Label SFTs = Some companies and teams produce their own customized versions of the Shocker: =Teams= * San Diego Dynasty * Ton Ton * Strange * Tremor * Nasty *Power trip Companies * Shocktech * Hybrid * Free Flow * Warped Sportz * Octane * Dark * Toxic  Shocker NXT (2006-2009) In late 2006, Smart Parts released the Shocker NXT, which is an improved version of the Shocker SFT. It has the same basic shape and operation as the Shocker SFT, same internals and solenoid, and similar electronics. However, it features a number of enhancements from the factory, which are designed to drive it to a higher performance and greater reliability.

Based on the company's Have Blue demonstrator, the six Senior Prom vehicles proved successful in testing conducted at Area 51 in the late 1970s; despite this, the aircraft was not selected to enter production, and the program was terminated in the early 1980s. Design and development Following the success of the test programme for the Lockheed Have Blue stealth technology demonstrator aircraft, the United States Air Force awarded a contract to the Lockheed Advanced Development Projects division‚Äîthe \\"Skunk Works\\"‚Äîfor the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle, intended to act as the prototype of a cruise missile, that would apply the Have Blue's faceted design in order to reduce the radar cross section of the missile by deflecting electromagnetic waves from radar transmitters away from their source, instead of directly back at the radar set's antenna.Parsch 2005 The program began in 1977, with a reported budget of USD $24,000,000;Richardson 2001, p. 65. the design of the aircraft was closely based on that of Have Blue, except scaled down.Merlin 2011, p. 108. Intended for launch from Lockheed DC-130 Hercules drone launcher aircraft, the original configuration of the Senior Prom vehicle included winglets and a ventral fin; the aircraft was later modified to include a V-tail and more slender wings, closer in configuration to the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. Radar-absorbent material was applied to the airframe as part of its stealth configuration; in addition to the faceting of the design, similar to that of Have Blue and the F-117, the \\"sawtooth\\" wing profile bore similarities to the B-2 stealth bomber's planform. The Senior Prom vehicle was intended to be expendable; however, it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage.Merlin 2011, p. 109. The aircraft is believed to have been fitted with folding wings to facilitate carriage by the launching aircraft, and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures. Testing and cancellation The airframe of the Senior Prom vehicle was based on that of the Have Blue technology demonstrator, illustrated here. Flight testing of the Senior Prom vehicles began in October 1978; a total of six aircraft were built, which completed a total of fourteen flights over the duration of the testing programme. The craft were reportedly capable of flying within of a SPS-13 radar without generating a discernible return. Most testing took place at Groom Lake (\\"Area 51\\") in Nevada, with a DC-130 Hercules acting as the launch aircraft; there are also reports that some testing was conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in California, with a B-52 Stratofortress being used as the launch platform, while \\"Hangar 18\\" at the Groom Lake test complex was reportedly constructed to house the B-52 and Senior Prom combination.Peebles 1999, p. 289. Despite the success of the test programme, Senior Prom was cancelled in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber;Sweetman 2004, pp. 73-74. the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly after the end of the Senior Prom programme. Despite the cancellation of the programme in 1982, the Senior Prom remained highly classified into the 21st century. There are rumours that a small number of Senior Prom aircraft, configured for aerial reconnaissance, were acquired by the United States Air Force, and were used in secret missions over Eastern Europe late in the Cold War, over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, and over North Korea; there is no official confirmation of this being the case.

He was born in Morciano, Romagna, Italy. He lives and works in Milan. His brother, Gi√≤ Pomodoro (1930‚Äì2002) was also a sculptor. Pomodoro designed a controversial fiberglass crucifix for the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The piece is topped with a fourteen-foot diameter crown of thorns which hovers over the figure of Christ. Some of Pomodoro's Sphere Within Sphere (Sfera con Sfera) can be seen in the Vatican Museums, Trinity College, Dublin, the United Nations Headquarters and Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis, the de Young Museum in San Francisco, Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, American Republic Insurance Company in Des Moines, Iowa, the Columbus Museum of Art in Columbus, Ohio, the University of California, Berkeley, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, and the Tel Aviv University, Israel.  Early life  Arnaldo Pomodoro was born on 23 June 1926 in Morciano di Romagna, Montefeltro area. He received his diploma from the Technical Institute for Surveyors in Rimini, and then worked at the Public Works Office in Pesaro. He developed an interest in art and scenography, and attended the Art Institute in Pesaro.  1950s-60s  In 1953, Pomodoro attended an exhibition of Picasso which was held in Milan at the Palazzo Reale. This exhibition made a strong impression on him, and a year after he moved to Milan where he joined the artistic community and became friends with Lucio Fontana, Dangelo, Sanesi, Baj, and others. He took part in the 10th Triennale in Milan, and together with his brother Gio' he also participated in the Venice Biennale. In 1959, Arnaldo Pomodoro received a grant to study American art, and traveled to the United States for the first time. He describes his visit to MoMa and seeing Brancusi's sculptures as a strong inspiration for his work. In San Francisco, he met Mark Rothko who was teaching at the California School of Fine Arts. In New York Pomodoro met Costantino Nivola and Enrico Donati who introduced him to such artists as Franz Kline, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and others. He also met sculptors David Smith and Louise Nevelson, and organized an exhibition New Work from Italy, dedicated to the Italian artists. Later in 1960s, he developed a collaboration with the Marlborough Gallery in New York. In 1963, Pomodoro received the International Prize for Sculpture at the VII S√£o Paulo Biennale and also the National Prize for Sculpture at the XXXII Venice Biennale in 1964. In 1966, he became an artist in residence at Stanford University, and then at UC Berkeley and Mills College. The following year he created the Sfera grande for the Italian Pavilion at the Montreal Expo. This sculpture is now located in front of the Farnesina Palace in Rome. That year Pomodoro won the International Prize for Sculpture from the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.  1970s-80s  In 1972, Arnaldo Pomodoro returned to set design, and worked on the play Das K√§thchen von Heilbronn by Heinrich von Kleist, which was staged in Zurich. In 1984, he had a large retrospective exhibition at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence. In 1988, Pomodoro participated in the Venice Biennale as well as the international exhibition of sculpture at the World Expo in Brisbane. His work Forme del Mito(Forms of Myth) which was displayed at the Expo, was later purchased by Brisbane City Council for the City of Brisbane. Sfera con Sfera,The Berkeley Library, Trinity College, Dublin  1990s-present  In 1990, Arnaldo Pomodoro received the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture from the Japan Art Association. His work Sfera con Sfera was installed in the Cortile della Pigna of the Vatican Museums. In 1992, he was awarded an honorary degree in Literature by Trinity College in Dublin. The following year he was nominated the honorary member of the Brera Art Academy in Milan. In 1995, the Fondazione Arnaldo Pomodoro was created as a cultural and exhibition center dedicated to contemporary art. Originally conceived as a centre to document and archive the work of the artist, it opened an exhibition space in 2005, hosting exhibitions of prominent artists such as Jannis Kounellis, Lucio Fontana and Robert Rauschenberg. The director of Fondazione Arnaldo Pomodoro is Flaminio Gualdoni. In 1996, Arnaldo Pomodoro was awarded the Knight of the Great Cross of the Italian Republic (Cavaliere di gran croce dell'Ordine al merito della Repubblica italiana). His sculpture Sfera con Sfera was installed in front of the United Nations building in New York City.

He was a member of the Aligarh Movement and was a professor, principal of MAO College, first pro vice-chancellor, vice chancellor and rector of Aligarh Muslim University, India. He served as vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University for three terms. In 1917, he was appointed a member of the Calcutta University Commission also known as the Sadler Commission. He was also a member of Skeen Committee also known as Indian Sandhurst Committee and Shea Commission for the Indianisation of the British Indian Army.  Early life  He was born on 13 February 1873, in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, British India.. Retrieved 6 June 2017. His primary education was at a madrasa and later joined Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh. Ahmad's association with Aligarh began in 1889, when at the age of 16 years, he joined the ‚Äòfirst year‚Äô at the M.A.O. College School. He passed high school in first division and was awarded the Lang Medal and a government scholarship. He had to join the Government College, Allahabad, as science courses were not available at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. He returned to Aligarh and passed his B.A in 1895 in first division, standing first among science students, and was awarded Strachy Gold Medal. Soon after passing B.A., he was appointed assistant lecturer in mathematics at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. On the basis of merit he was nominated for the post of deputy collector, but Ahmad declined the offer and elected to continue in the service of the college. Sir Syed offered him a permanent appointment in the grade of Rs 60-100, provided he signed a bond to serve for a period of five years. He responded by undertaking to serve for his entire life. A highly impressed Sir Syed tore up the bond. = Education = Ahmad completed his BA in mathematics (with distinction) from Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1895. He was the first Muslim to obtain a D.Sc. (Mathematics), from Allahabad University. His field was complex logarithms applications. He published in differential geometry and algebraic geometry. He won the Lytton Strachey Gold Medal in 1897. While teaching, he continued his education and earned M.A. degrees from Calcutta and Allahabad Universities and also a D.Sc from the latter in 1901. In 1901, Ahmad left for England on a government scholarship and obtained his honours degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. He was awarded the Isaac Newton Scholarship in 1904, the first Indian awardee becoming the first Indian to secure this coveted honour. He became a Wrangler He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and London Mathematical Society. Thereafter He joined the Gointtingen University in Germany in 1904 and received a PhD from the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany. He visited Paris University and Bologna University for advanced studies in modern geometry. He did research in astronomy in Bologna, Italy. He visited Al Azhar University, Cairo to understand their academic methodologies. = Professor = On his return to India in 1907, Ahmad joined his alma mater. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the AMU Foundation and Constitution Committees. He became a professor of history at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College and in 1918 was selected principal. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1915 King's Birthday Honours list. He coached students who were seeking admission at Roorkie Engineering College. He held seminars and coached students in engineering and forestry. Ahmad paid to bring students to Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. One of the most notable was Hasrat Mohani, who hailed from Kanpur and was planning to go to Lucknow. Ahmad noticed Mohani's math talent and went to Kanpur to convince him and his family to attend MAO College. He was appointed assistant master in MAO College and served as Acting Principal for a time in 1913. Along with Professor Chakravarti, Ahmad cofounded the first group of researchers focused on Astronomy, History of Mathematics and Theory of Functions. They made innovations in teaching and other discoveries. In 1890, MAO College Mathematics Society was formed with him as president and A.M. Kureishy as secretary. The society continues as Aligarh Mathematical Society. The Department of Mathematics was founded when MAO College was given the status of a residential University in 1920, becoming one of its oldest departments. Ahmad was the first professor and head of the department. Principal of the College Beck and Sir Morrison proposed that Ahmad be appointed Deputy Collector with UP Government, which paid Rs. 500/-. He declined the offer in favor of a position as assistant lecturer at the college making Rs. 60/- per month. Khan offered Ahmad a five-year contract, but Ahmad told him that he planned to spend his life there and that anyone who would stay only complete a contract would not be worth keeping. Khan tore up the contract and Ahmad's career as a teacher began. To keep his promise to Khan, he left the Indian Civil Service. Ahmad also taught other subjects. For example, in 1897, Professor Arnold, who taught logic, resigned. The budget did not have room for a faculty member from England and so Ahmad took over. =Sadler Commission= At the time of the Government of India Resolution in 1913 five universities operated in India. Colleges were outside the control of the various universities. At this time London University was reorganised per recommendations of the Royal Commission. A decision to reform Indian Universities led to a second university commission, the 1917 Calcutta University Commission. The members of the commission were Sir Ziauddin Kamboh, Dr. Gregory, Ramsay Muir, Sir Hartog, Dr. Horniel and Sir Asutosh Mukerji. At the time of the Government of India Resolution in 1913 there were only five universities in India and the number of colleges was beyond the control of the various universities within their territorial limits. As a result, different administrative problems piled up in that period. Sir Asutosh Mukherji was the vice chancellor of Calcutta University. He started imparting post-graduate education in the university in 1916 as recommended by the University Education Commission of 1902. This has attracted the attention of the Government. By this time the London University was reorganised and reformed as per recommendations of the Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Halden. Therefore, it became a necessity to reform the Indian Universities also. All these circumstances led to the formation of the second university commission. i.e., Calcutta University Commission, 1917. The commission reviewed the entire field from school education to university education. The Sadler Commission held the view that improved secondary education was a necessary condition for the improvement of university education. =Indianisation of officer ranks of British Indian Army= The British Government of India appointed the Indian Sandhurst Committee also known as Skeen Committee in March 1925 with the objective of reform and Indianisation of British Indian Army. This committee was consisted of Lt.General Sir Andrew Skeen who was the then Chief of General Staff of India as Chairman, and 12 Indian of Military and civil stature as its member. Sir Ziauddin along with Motilal Nehru, M.A.Jinnah, Sardar Jogendra Singh, Sir Phiroze Sethna, Ramachandra Rao,Sahibzada Abdul Qaiyum, Capt. Hira Singh, Capt. J.N. Banerjee, Major Thaku Zorawar Singh were its members. This committee met for the first time in Shimla and quickly decided upon its working. It studied French, American, Canadian, British military system and submitted its report within 6 months. The committee recommended the opening of a Military college in India at Dehradoon which later become Indian Military Academy. Aligarh Muslim University In 1911, a Central Committee was set up to transform MAO College into a university, with Raja Mahmoodabad as president, Syed Ali Bilgrami as secretary and Ahmad as joint secretary. The college had to raise Rs. 30 lakh (3 million) for elevation to university status, which was achieved in 1915. The student body at that time was less than 1500. Ahmad traveled across India to raise funds. He established most of the departments of AMU. He collected funds to open a Medical College at AMU, which later became Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC). He drafted the new University's Constitution. The university named its dental college after Ahmad. He founded the Commerce and Polytechnic Departments and several other departments. On his recommendation Abdullah School merged with AMU. = Vice Chancellor = He became AMU's first pro-vice-chancellor. He was elected vice- chancellor in 1934, remaining until 1946, becoming its longest serving VC. He became an honorary professor in the department, working simultaneously as vice-chancellor. Because of his love for the subject, he taught courses both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. He was AMU's only teaching VC. With his help, Islamia College was established in Lahore. Ahmad laid the foundation stone for the college and for Islamia College, Peshawar. = Students = He recommended students for all kinds of employment, ranging from clerical and administrative to military. Ahmad visited students in their dormitories and mediated sometimes violent student disputes. Habib A. Kamboh, who was also Ahmad's student, writes, \\"In 1946-47, when I was a student in Xth class at M.U. High School,...he lectured us either once or twice a week....He was a fine teacher. His goal was to include Trigonometry in High School curriculum.\\" Ahmad encouraged informal relations between faculty and students. The university emphasized sports and had a Riding School, a unit of U.O.T.C., and an active Student Union, where students elected their leaders and participated in debates. When the British hung the father of Pir Pagara, Pir Sabghatullah Shah Rashidi, on 20 March 1943, and abolished his Gaddi (Spiritual Office), Pir Pagara Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II was hardly 15 years old. During the same year Ahmad, at that time AMU vice-chancellor, took him and his brother to Aligarh. At Aligarh the brothers stayed in 'English House', a hostel established to house the sons of nawabs and rajas. In 1946 Ahmad arranged for their education in England. He was known for throwing parties, often entertaining visiting dignitaries at his house. He often invited people for dinner with ever-swelling guest lists. =Khilafat movement= In 1920, Indian Muslims, led by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar and his brother Maulana Shaukat Ali, launched a movement to restore the Khilafat (caliphate) in Turkey. The Turks themselves had no use for the Khilafat and had chosen Mustafa Kemal Pasha as their leader; the Arabs did not want it and the British opposed it. The Congress party supported their efforts and on 9 September 1920, passed a resolution which began the non-cooperation movement. This movement was hailed as a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in India. On 11 October 1920, the Ali brothers visited Aligarh with Swami Satya Dev and Gandhiji. These leaders were invited to address the MAO College Student Union. The students passed a resolution in support of non-cooperation with the British government, condemned the British attitude towards Turkey, demanded that the college accept no grants from the government and discontinue affiliation with Allahabad University. Furthermore, the resolution asked to change MAO College into a National University independent of the government. Ahmad had accepted Khan Ahmed Khan's thesis that Muslims should not get involved in politics until reaching educational parity with other Indian communities. He approached the university authorities, and convinced them to keep the college out of this struggle. When the crisis deepened, he closed the college and sent the students home. Ahmad made great efforts to bring about reconciliation between the members of the board of trustees, and succeeded in bringing most students back to campus. In honor of Ahmad, who was now known as Doctor Sahib, the faculty and staff on campus gave a dinner to which college trustees as well as British officers of Aligarh and Agra were invited. Khawaja Abdul Majeed, one of the trustees who did not support him initially, stated: \\"I was against Dr. Sahib‚Äôs appointment as Principal, but the improvements that have resulted under his leadership have convinced me that this will be good for the future of students, staff, honorary Secretary, public and the relations with the government.\\"(Zia-e -Hayat. P. 234). Ahmad had opposed a popular movement and risked alienating the Muslim masses. He had to choose between supporting a popular movement and losing government support (financial and otherwise) or establishing a Muslim University with government assistance. When classes resumed, a sizeable number of students stayed home. It appeared that the sharp decline in enrollment the college would cost the college its elevation. Dr. Sahib visited several towns and convince most of the students to return, while new students enrolled. However, Ahmad earned the wrath of people who continued to oppose him thereafter. At the same time he found a solid base that supported him. = Elevation = On 1 December 1920 the Muslim University Act passed, and thus MAO College became Aligarh Muslim University. Raja Mahmoodabad became the first vice-chancellor and Ahmad, pro-vice-chancellor. Raja Sahib was not particularly in favor of Dr. Sahib becoming the PVC, instead preferring an Englishman. When no European was willing to accept this position and no other capable Muslim was available, he accepted Ahmad. The University Act stated that the PVC would become \\"the principal academic officer of the university.\\" It was further stipulated that in the absence of the vice chancellor the PVC would act as the chairman of the Academic Council. Dr. Sahib and Raja Sahib often held differing views on managing university affairs. After a year, Raja Sahib resigned and Nawabzada Aftab Ahmed Khan became the V.C. In 1922, Dr. Sahib was re-elected to the State Assembly. = Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan = Fundamental disagreements developed between Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan and Dr. Sahib. Sahibzada was a lawyer and was a stickler for rules and regulations, while Dr. Sahib maintained that \\"rules are made for students; students are not made for rules.\\" Dr. Amir Husain Siddiqui stated, \\"Dr. Ahmad created educational aids, reduced fees and other expenditure, relaxed the rules for admission and examinations and encouraged extra lectures for those who fell short of attendance.\\".(Zia-i-Hayat. P.18) These policies made him popular among students and parents. He introduced a system of private examinations, because the government did not permit the affiliation of colleges and schools to the university. It was not clear whether students could appear in exams as private candidates, but he continued this practice while PVC. In 1925, the university administration celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the foundation of Aligarh College. At this time differences between the VC and the PVC surfaced. Dr. Sahib decided to take a leave and asked the VC to appoint a replacement. Sahibzada refused his request and prevailed upon him to continue as PVC. The Jubilee was celebrated on a grand scale, and raised Rs 176,000/-. Dr. Sahib reserved these funds for the establishment of an Engineering College and Departments of Applied Physics and Applied Chemistry. However, by law the university was required to obtain permission from the government and the effort was unsuccessful. = Resignation = In February 1926, Dr. Sahib's term as PVC ended and with Sahibzada Sahib recommendation began another term. However, when Sahibzada's own term as VC ended in December 1926, the trustees appointed Nawab Sir Muzzamil Ullah Khan in his place. Before leaving Sahibzada wrote a pamphlet pointing out irregularities for which he held Dr. Sahib responsible. He sent a copy to the Viceroy, to Begum Bhopal (Chancellor) and to the trustees. Moin- ul-Haque, who was on the History Department faculty, claimed that Dr. Sahib was willing to break rules to aid students in graduating and finding work.(Aligarh Ki Kahani Imaratoun Ki Zabani, pp. 54‚Äì56) The pamphlet resulted in the formation of an inquiry committee. The committee expressed appreciation of Dr. Sahib services, but recommended that he take a six-month paid leave and then retire. Before the University Court could meet to discuss the issue, Dr. Sahib submitted his resignation, to take effect from 27 April 1928, declining the offer of leave. Farewell parties produced poems in his honor. One staff member, Qazi Jalal Uddin, wrote a two-page poem. The Vice-President of the Student Union, in his farewell address, stated: \\"If Khan was the founder of this institution, you are beyond a question its savior.\\" After 33 years, Ahmad left Aligarh on 27 April 1928. According to Zia-i-Hayat, almost the entire student body came to bid him farewell at the railway station. = New colleges = Seven years after he had left Aligarh, Ahmad returned to the University on 19 April 1935, as vice-chancellor. He immediately made plans to improve the Science Faculty. Although plans for a building for Tibbiya College had been discussed earlier, Dr. Sahib moved to make it a reality. The work was completed in 1940. At that time Sir Shah Sulaiman was serving as vice chancellor. Dr. Sahib next launched a program to establish an Institute of Technology. Nawab of Jungadh donated Rs 50,000/- to this program. Nawab Muzzamil Ullah Khan donated his Johnson Factory Building to the effort along with two of his old cars, so that students enrolled in the motor engineering course could work on them.(Iftikhar Alam Khan. P. 149) In 1937, Ahmad proposed a College of Technology to prepare students for work in electrical, mechanical, sanitary and civil engineering and agriculture. Other related subjects included applied chemistry, electro-chemistry, and textile chemistry. In the same year, the Technology workshop opened. Its foundation stone was laid by Nawab Sahib of Rampur. In 1937, Girls Intermediate College became a Degree College and affiliated with the university. At the same time, upon Ahmad's recommendation, for the first time girls were admitted to their Teachers Training College. Dr. Sahib also proposed a military college. His first term ended on 30 April 1938. He was succeeded by Sir Shah Suleiman, a judge of the Federal Court, who then died on 13 March 1941. Ahmad was appointed vice-chancellor for the second time on 24 April 1941. Tibbiya College became his administration's top priority. Work on the college building was completed 1943 due to scarcity of resources. His second priority was the establishment of a full-fledged Engineering College. This goal was achieved by 1945. He made an effort to establish an airport near the university in 1942. Nawab Sahib Bhopal contributed Rs 50,000/- to build an aeronautics workshop. The university acquired a plane as well, enabling students to take flying lessons. Ahmad proposed to establish a department of applied physics and to attach it to the College of Engineering. Ahmad's second term as VC came to an end in 1943 and he was reappointed. In 1944, he proposed to establish a medical College at Aligarh, for which he collected a sum of Rs. 50 lakh (5 million) by the end of 1946. In 1945, Commerce College opened. He then began to shift his focus from career training to scholarship and the quality of education. =Resignation and appointment as Rector= In December 1946 some students spread a rumor, encouraged by his enemies, that Dr. Sahib had confiscated all copies of a magazine that reported riots in Bihar and that he was going to have its student author arrested. Between 250 and 300 students marched to the vice-chancellor's office shouting slogans, \\"Ahmad Must Go.\\" Dr. Sahib remained in his office and asked student representatives what they wanted. They asked for his resignation, which he immediately did.(Zia-e-Hayat, p. 105) In the evening, around 500‚Äì600 students went to his house shouting, \\"Ahmad come back.\\" He did not withdraw his resignation, despite the entreaties of the executive council and the court. The court unanimously passed a resolution expressing their confidence in his leadership, and recommended his appointment as rector of the university‚Äîto which he acceded. He devoted the rest of his time to raising funds for Aligarh's medical college. M.S. Aney, Governor of Bihar, wrote about Dr. Sahib: \\"‚Ä¶Last I met him was when he came to Colombo on a deputation of the Aligarh University to collect funds for the Medical College. I believe he made handsome collections there and was received very warmly, not just by Mohammedans at Colombo, but by other communities also. I had great respect for his learning and versatility.\\"(Zia-e-Hayat, p. 101)  Politics  By 1915 he was taking interest in public affairs and in technical and vocational education. He was appointed Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of UP in 1919 and 1922 as representative of Allahabad University. he presided over the second Muslim Kamboh Conference held at Marehra (District Etha UP) on 21 and 22 April 1935 in Marison Islamia School. In 1924 he was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Muslim Constituency of Mainpuri, Etah and Farrukhabad. = Central Assembly = He was elected a Member of the Central Assembly in 1930. He was repeatedly elected from different constituencies and served in the Central Legislature until 1947. In 1946, he was the chief whip of the Muslim League in the Central Assembly. He was knighted in the 1938 New Year Honours list. He sponsored the Indian Foreign Relations Act in Parliament. Ahmad worked on the budget for the Indian Railways and with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). When RBI was founded he was involved in moving legislation for its more efficient functioning. = Anwer Noor = In 1931 Anwer Noor, in the Frontier Province, was so offended by an assistant commissioner that he attacked him. The officer was not injured, but Noor was nevertheless executed, creating a political issue. A committee was appointed to submit a report. However, the government seized the report before it was published. Ahmad stated that no harm had come to the assistant commissioner, that Noor had had no chance to appeal and that the government should say what greater punishment should follow a more serious attack. The colonial government thereafter withdrew the laws in question.(Zia- e-Hayat. pp. 240‚Äì41). = Aligarh Muslim University Centres = After the demise of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in 1898, Sir Syed Memorial Fund was created in different parts of country and the effort for the establishment of a Muslim University was sped up. All the persons associated with this movement wanted all Muslim institutions of India to be affiliated to the Muslim University. Dr. Sir Ziauddin Kamboh, while presenting the idea of the Muslim University at Lahore session of All India Muslim Educational Conference in 1898, discussed at length the concept of a university and emphasized the importance of the right of affiliating colleges. Ahmad moved a billentral Legislative Assembly to amend the University Act 1920 to empower AMU to recognize and affiliate Schools and Colleges outside Aligarh. However, due to empathy of British ruler towards education of Indians the bill failed. In February, 2011, this vision was realised by the opening of two Centres of Aligarh Muslim University in Mallapuram, Kerala and Murshidabad, West Bengal. In November 2013, the university opened a third satellite, in Kishanganj, Bihar. =Muslim League= Ahmad was an originally member of the Independent Party, which included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. When this party dissolved he joined the Muslim League and served as its Parliamentary Secretary. In evaluating his performance in the Assembly, N.V Gadgil wrote: \\"Dr. Ahmad Ahmed was a popular figure in the Central Assembly during the period of my membership of that body. He was very well informed on Railway and General Finance‚Ä¶ He was catholic in his hospitality, charitable towards friends and a conscientious legislator...\\" (Zia-e -Hayat, p. 100)  Death  He was also a member of the East India Railway Company's board of directors, and the viceroy appointed him as a member of his defense council. Ahmad was knighted by the Crown. During World War II he served as a lieutenant colonel. Ahmad left India for Europe and America in 1947. While on a plane returning from Paris to London, he suffered a stroke. The stroke was followed by pneumonia. When his condition slightly improved, he invited Aligarians living in London for tea. He advised them to go back to India upon completing their education. He even requested his physician, Ghayasuddin, to move to India. Krishna Menon, India's High Commissioner in U.K, visited Ahmad several times, as did Pakistan's high commissioner, Habib Ibrahim Rahimtoola. He died in London on 22 December 1947. His body, as he had requested, was sent back to Aligarh. Many people visited his family. At that time Nawab Ismail Khan was serving as vice chancellor. University authorities decided that Ahmad should be buried in the university mosque. His body was brought to the Cricket Pavilion for viewing. Students overruled the administration's choice of burial site and prepared his grave next to that of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. On his tomb stone is inscribed, \\"Hazarooun Saal Nargis Upni Bay Noori Pay Routi Hay Bari Mushkil Say Houta Hay Chaman mein Deeda Were Paida.\\" Family and legacy Sir Ziauddin is a part of the famous Zuberi family. Sir Ziauddin's son Zakauddin Ahmad lived in Aligarh. Zakauddin had three children, Anjum Zia (female), Nigaht Zia (female), and Ahmad Ziauddin (Ahmad Zia). Ahmad's daughter Dr. Ejaz Fitma is the wife of Dr. Tajammul Hussain. She has four children (two sons and two daughters), namely Asim Hussain, former Petroleum Minister and Presidential Advisor of Pakistan, Dr. Rubina Hussain, Dr. Arif Hussain and Sabina Hussain, owner of Dr. Sir Ziauddin Ahmad University, Karachi.

It was withdrawn from the market after it was found to cause pulmonary hypertension. In the U.S., it is an illegal Schedule I drug, meaning it has high abuse potential, no accepted medical use, and a poor safety profile. Aminorex, in the 2-amino-5-aryl oxazoline class, was developed by McNeil Laboratories in 1962. It is closely related to 4-methylaminorex. Aminorex has been shown to have locomotor stimulant effects, lying midway between dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. Aminorex effects have been attributed to the release of catecholamines. It can be produced as a metabolite of the worming medication levamisole, which is sometimes used as a cutting agent of illicitly produced cocaine. History It was discovered in 1962 by Edward John Hurlburt, and was quickly found in 1963 to have an anorectic effect in rats. It was introduced as a prescription appetite suppressant in Germany, Switzerland and Austria in 1965, but was withdrawn in 1972 after it was found to cause pulmonary hypertension in approximately 0.2% of patients, and was linked to a number of deaths. Synthesis The synthesis was first reported in a structure-activity relationship study of 2-amino-5-aryl-2-oxazolines, where aminorex was found to be approximately 2.5 times more potent than D-amphetamine sulfate in inducing anorexia in rats, and was also reported to have CNS stimulant effects. thumb The racemic synthesis involves addition/cyclization reaction of 2-amino-1-phenylethanol with cyanogen bromide. A similar synthesis has been also published. In a search for a cheaper synthetic route, a German team developed an alternative routeDE Patent 2101424 2-amino-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline preparation which, by using chiral styrene oxide, allows an enantiopure product.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The short was released on September 29, 1956, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. The title is a play on the exclamation, \\"The deuce you say!\\" The cartoon features Daffy Duck as the dim-witted detective Dorlock Homes (a parody of Sherlock Holmes) and Porky Pig as his sidekick Watkins (Dr. Watson), as they attempt to locate and apprehend the dangerous \\"Shropshire Slasher\\". Plot Dr. Watkins narrates throughout the cartoon. Dorlock Homes lives on Beeker Street in London. Inside of their apartment, Homes is busily engaged in \\"deduction\\" ‚Äî tax deduction, that is, hoping to write off such costs as \\"magnifying glasses and gumshoes\\" and \\"cab fares, to and from murders\\". Following a knock on the door, a mailman falls into their flat. While Homes attributes it to curare, a type of poison, the mailman chides him for not fixing the step. Homes, angry, quickly snatches the letter from and sternly informs him in no uncertain terms \\"Just for that, you receive no gratuity.\\" The letter says that there is a criminal on the loose named the Shropshire Slasher. Homes and Watkins go to a pub where the Slasher is known to hang out. Homes' attempts to gather clues land darts in his bill. When the Shropshire Slasher is finally revealed, Homes repeatedly attempts to arrest him, but the Slasher proves much stronger and effortlessly defeats Homes. Watkins, on the other hand, speaks much more politely and reasonably to the suspect and he not only willingly divulges his identity, but is peacefully persuaded to turn himself back over to the police. Just then, a kind, old woman arrives selling flowers. Homes accuses her of selling them without a license and threatens to arrest her. The Shropshire Slasher moans \\"Mother!\\" Before Homes has time to consider what has happened, the Shropshire Slasher grabs him by the neck and starts shaking him violently, causing an assortment of objects to fall from Homes' person. The Shropshire Slasher and his mother then leave, with him explaining to her that he promised \\"the nice gentleman\\" that he would give himself up, and her praising him for willingly giving himself up. Watkins asks a beat-up looking Homes in what school he learned to be a detective. Homes answers: \\"Elementary, my dear Watkins. Elementary\\".

Former anchors include H. H. Gregg, Borders, Shoppers, Toys R Us, Chuck E. Cheese, and Sports Authority. Central Park also includes a Homewood Suites by Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, and a Hampton Inn & Suites with one more hotel scheduled to open in the next few years. In 2020 the Fredericksburg Nationals (formerly known as the Potomac Nationals) relocated to a new stadium constructed next to the Fredericksburg Expo & Conference Center. In late January 2006, the Fredericksburg Expo & Conference Center opened, giving the Fredericksburg region its first convention center. Central Park is also home to Central Park Funland, a small family fun park consisting of indoor/outdoor entertainment. Outdoor attractions consist of go karts, batting cages, and mini golf, while the indoor area offers an array of activities, to include Laser Tag, mini bowling games, a rollercoaster simulator and hundreds of arcade games and small children's rides. Fun Land also hosts children's birthday parties, and group rates for corporate, church or sporting event gatherings, with private event rooms to accommodate. A large mega church is also has its main campus located across from Fun Land. History Central Park was developed by the Silver Companies. (Carl D. Silver Parkway, the primary road through Central Park, is named after the founder and owner of the Silver Companies.) Before the complex was developed, the site was occupied by a Sheraton Hotel and a golf course. The complex was begun in 1995, and is still expanding and growing. Central Park is now a power center. It serves as the retail shopping and primary dining component of the mega-development Celebrate Virginia, which uses the slogan \\"North America's Largest Retail Resort\\" and spans Stafford County, the Rappahannock River, and the City of Fredericksburg. Across Route 3 from Central Park is the older Spotsylvania Mall, which has undergone extensive renovation to become the Spotsylvania Towne Centre. In June 2020, Chuck E. Cheese announced that this location will be permanently closed as a part of a plan to close 34 locations nationwide due to bankruptcy. https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/26/chuck-e-cheese-store-closings- list-chapter-11-bankruptcy/3262669001/ Many area residents complain that the developers did not make adequate allowances for the increase in traffic caused by the complex.

The 18th-century plantation, now owned by the Lafferty family, has been in continuous operation for more than 300 years. In addition to the plantation house, dependency buildings and cultivated land, Elsing Green includes of surrounding farmland, forest and marsh land. Elsing Green is also on the Virginia Landmarks Register and in the National Register of Historic Places. Its history dates back nearly three centuries with ties to the West family of Lord Delaware. The original structure, a brick Jacobean lodge now serving as the east dependency of the manor house, was built before 1690 by Colonel John West. It is said that Lord Delaware used the building as his hunting lodge, escaping to the King William woods by way of the Pamunkey River. Now serving as a wildlife refuge, no hunting is allowed on the property or surrounding wetlands.  History  Although fire during the American Civil War destroyed many of the records detailing the history of Elsing Green, the Lafferty Foundation holds to what it believes as an accurate account of the plantation's history. The plantation was passed down through the West family after the death of Colonel John West in 1692. It eventually became associated with the Dandridge family of George Washington's wife, Martha Custis. It is said that Martha Custis Washington actually rode her horse through the house. The Dandridges built the Queen Anne manor house and kitchen house between 1715 and 1720. Carter Braxton, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, bought the plantation in 1753. The plantation, through several inheritances and purchases, was eventually sold in the 1930s to Beverly D. Causey, whose family took it upon themselves to restore the then degraded property and structures. Nearly two decades later, the family of the current owners purchased Elsing Green. In 1950, Edgar R. Lafferty, Jr., and his wife, Margaret, continued the restoration and expanded the plantation by adding previously purchased land adjacent to Elsing Green. The Lafferty family formed the Lafferty Foundation to help preserve and protect Elsing Green after Edgar Lafferty, Jr.‚Äôs death. The tax-exempt organization acquired the plantation after Edgar Lafferty, Jr.‚Äôs death. To further ensure its preservation, Lafferty granted historic preservation easements to the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission and the Virginia Outdoors Foundation.  Architecture and furnishings  The exterior of the Queen Anne manor house is Flemish-bond brickwork, with its erection dating back to between 1715 and 1720. It is two- stories and U-shaped, with east and west wings jutting to the north. Doors on either side of the wing lead to a detached east dependency home (the original hunting lodge) and a west kitchen house. The Pamunkey River lies just from the home. In the home is 18th-century American and English furniture, including the ‚ÄúSurrender Table‚Äù on which the American and French negotiated terms of surrender with the English over the Battle of Yorktown of the American Revolutionary War.

History The band was formed in 1982 by members of the disbanded General Motors Pipe Band with support from a 78th Fraser Highlanders re-enactment group, but the band was allowed to keep the name after support from the group ceased. The 78th Frasers became the first non-Scottish band to win the World Pipe Band Championships, in the summer of 1987, breaking Strathclyde Police Pipe Band's (now Greater Glasgow Police Scotland Pipe Band) run of six consecutive wins. Founding pipe major Bill Livingstone stepped down from the role in 2010 after 29 years. The band is currently led by pipe major Doug MacRae and drum sergeant Drew Duthart. The band has won both the North American Pipe Band Championships (held in Maxville, Ontario) and the Canadian Pipe Band Championships (held in Cambridge, Ontario) a total of twelve times each. The Frasers travel to Scotland each summer to compete at the World's, and have finished in the prize list eleven times.

Allan joined his brother-in-law, Lead-Drummer Drew Duthart. Allan followed in the footsteps of his late father, Luke Allan, who played with the band during its most successful years in the 1980s and, coincidentally, left the 78th Frasers to play with the Toronto Police with his son-in-law, Drew Duthart, who was then the lead-drummer. As of January 2018, the band made another change at bass drum, with Sean Allan leaving before playing in a competition.

It was a subsidiary of Universal Music Group and was distributed through Republic Records.http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/a-young-music- executive-takes-over-at-motown/ Company history SRC was founded by Steve Rifkind in 2000. In 2002, he was ousted from his CEO position from Loud. Although he already had SRC, he made it a bigger priority and sign an exclusive distribution deal with Universal. The label was much like Loud Records, a hip hop and R&B; label. The first move with the label was signing David Banner, a rapper from Jackson, Mississippi. With Banner as their flagship artist, SRC soared to great heights behind his 2003 debut. The label was instantly hailed as the second-coming of Interscope Records, due to the obvious similarities. The hit single \\"Like A Pimp,\\" would make the label a household name within the hip hop community. During the year of 2003, the label would hit paydirt after hearing tapes from Senegalese singer, Akon, who they would immediately sign to their label. In 2004, Akon would release his multi-platinum debut album, Trouble. In early 2004, they signed a deal to distribute material from the rap supergroup, Terror Squad. SRC would go on to release all albums from Remy Ma and the group Terror Squad, itself. In the summer of 2004, SRC would become home to the hit single, \\"Lean Back,\\" by Fat Joe and Remy Ma. After these releases, SRC had established itself among the other heavyweight record labels in hip hop music. In 2005, the label granted Akon his own label Konvict Muzik. The deal brought more artists on to the label and a hit album from Akon. =Loud deal and later successes = In June 2007, Sony Music resurrected Rifkind's original label, Loud Records. Loud had been home to many of the more popular hip hop acts of the time, but would shut down operations in 2004. After the resurrection of Loud, Rifkind would buy the label and make it a subsidiary of SRC. His first act after re-gaining the label was, as he did fifteen years earlier, signing the Wu-Tang Clan.http://blogs.bet.com/music/soundOff/and-i-quote-asher-roth-ti-rick-ross- lyor-cohen-nick-cannon/ In August 2010 Rifkind signed rapper Joell Ortiz in a deal with SRC Records and Universal Motown Records.http://rapradar.com/2010/08/30/joell-ortiz-signing-with-src/ The label had a deal with Universal Republic Records, later the label was reverted to Republic Records. On July 29, 2012, Steve Rifkind announced that he was leaving Universal Records on September 1, 2012.

It is a biennial event which usually takes place on the first Saturday in May. Crews from Wales, Ireland, England and as far afield as Germany compete. Description The race is open to all 4-oared boats with a cox. No sliding seats or out-riggers are accepted. Normal class entries are Celtic Longboat, Pembrokeshire longboat, Irish East Coast skiff, Irish All Ireland class boat and a variety of Thames skiffs. Each crew consists of 12 people, therefore crew changeover strategies are a must. There is a Senior Men's category along with Senior Ladies, Veteran, Mixed and Miscellaneous categories. History In 1989 a crew from Aberystwyth Lifeboat rowed from Arklow to Aberystwyth to raise money for the Bronglais Hospital Scanner Appeal, raising a sum of approximately ¬£4000, taking well over 22 hours to complete the course. In 1991 the Lifeboat crew did another sponsored row from Arklow to Aberystwyth raising money towards the new Lifeboat Station at Aberystwyth. It was from these two sponsored crossings from Arklow that the idea for Celtic Challenge was conceived. In 1993 the first Celtic Challenge Rowing race took place starting from Arklow and ending in Aberystwyth and since then the challenge has taken place in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2006 and 2008. The 2001 event was cancelled due to foot and mouth and in 2002 14 crews took part. The 2004 challenge was cancelled due to bad weather. 2006 had 17 entries. A documentary of the 2008 Celtic Challenge, called 'Crossing the Irish' was completed by Rob Garwood in 2009.

Miracle Early in his reign, Beopheung had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's \\"Grand Secretary\\", Ichadon, devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527 CE. Ichadon's body was then taken to the Geumgang mountains and buried there with respect. His martyrdom led to the construction of Heungryun monastery, Silla's first state-sponsored temple.

He was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey . Campbell began his broadcasting career at the age of 17 at a radio station in his hometown of Atlantic City. He moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1941 as a Minor League Baseball announcer, and then settled in Philadelphia in 1942, where he lived the rest of his life. Campbell first started in area radio at WIP, before moving to WCAU in 1946 as sports director, taking the same position when WCAU- TV began its historic telecasts, in 1948; he remained in that position until 1966. Campbell was play-by-play announcer for the Philadelphia Warriors from their debut in 1946 until their move to San Francisco in 1962, calling Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. He was also play-by-play announcer for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1952‚Äì66, Philadelphia Phillies from 1963‚Äì70, and Philadelphia 76ers from 1972‚Äì81. Campbell later held down the 10 AM to noon slot at his first Delaware Valley broadcasting employer, WIP, when it switched to an all-sports format, from 1987‚Äì1991. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Campbell into their Hall of Fame in 1999 and named him their Person of the Year in 2008. Campbell was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award by the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005. He died on October 6, 2014, aged 91, at a hospital in Camden, New Jersey.

Test engineers are also responsible for determining the best way a test can be performed in order to achieve adequate test coverage. Often test engineers also serve as a liaison between manufacturing, design engineering, sales engineering and marketing communities as well. Test engineers can have different expertise, which depends on what test process they are more familiar with (although many test engineers have full familiarity from the PCB level processes like ICT, JTAG, and AXI) to PCBA and system level processes like board functional test (BFT or FT), burn-in test, system level test (ST). Some of the processes used in manufacturing where a test engineer is needed are: * In-circuit test (ICT) * Stand-alone JTAG test * Automated x-ray inspection (AXI) (also known as X-ray test) * Automated optical inspection (AOI) test * Center of Gravity (CG) test * Continuity or flying probe test * Electromagnetic compatibility or EMI test * (Board) functional test (BFT/FT) * Burn-in test * Environmental stress screening (ESS) test * Highly Accelerated Life Test (HALT) * Highly accelerated stress screening (HASS) test * Insulation test * Ongoing reliability test (ORT) * Regression test * System test (ST) * Vibration test * Final quality audit process (FQA) test Early project involvement from design phase Ideally, a test engineer's involvement with a product begins with the very early stages of the engineering design process, i.e. the requirements engineering stage and the design engineering stage. Depending on the culture of the firm, these early stages could involve a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)‚Äîsome of the earliest work done during a new product introduction (NPI). By working with or as part of the NPI group, a test engineer ensures that a product is designed for both testability and manufacturability. In other words, to make sure that the product can be readily tested and built. The following are some general rules to ensure testability and manufacturability of a product: * Making sure the product has correct label specs and placement that would make it possible for the unit to be traceable and programmable. Implementing good label specs results in having correct information programmed correctly into the unit under test (UUT) (sometimes called DUT or device under test). To make this possible, the test engineers enforce those labels location and are all readable and scannable, thus eliminating the need for a manual typing of information into the unit. Automatic placing of identification codes into the part during test and making them available for verification at later processing steps can help minimize these types of errors. Manual typing can introduce problems related to inaccurate information being programmed due to human errors. Also, without the test engineers input during PRD design phase, the hardware engineer in charge of designing of the silk-screen for the PCB may put those labels below some attachable board which will then later renders the labels useless (i.e. in a motherboard/daughterboard design and also a board that has a pluggable module, a label would be visible on the main board by itself but would be obstructed by the other boards that needs to be integrated). This information are often indicated in both PRD and MRD. * Making sure that all components required to test and debug the UUT, which includes the console/serial port, are all accessible from the early part of the manufacturing process up to the last part which is often the final quality audit/assurance (FQA) process. This also includes making sure those components are available even after the units are returned by the customers for troubleshooting or repair. By following this guidelines, the team will eliminate unnecessary opening of the UUT just to access those components which may result in introducing errors into the unit (i.e. knocking off some capacitors or resistors when opening/sliding out the cover, dropping the tool inside the PCBA after opening, forgetting some other cables to reconnect before closing the unit for manufacturing process flow continuation, etc.). * Making sure that all components needed to test the unit are added into the cost matrix of the final product. This components may include the UART/RS232 chips for talking to the UUT, ethernet ports for upgrading the firmware, JTAG connectors, etc. * Defining what manufacturing test process is needed based from the product definition. * Verifying that the currently available test equipment is adequate for testing the proposed design. If new equipment is needed, budgetary concerns have been addressed and sufficient lead time exists for new equipment installation and verification. Also, new test equipment may require training for test equipment operators and supervisors. By following the general rules above, test engineers minimize future surprises (like adding extra components, re-layout of the boards, etc.) which drives up costs and development delays of the final product. Working with cross platform teams, hardware and software team Often people take shortcuts to be able to deliver final products. Because of these shortcuts, the product's manufacturability and testability becomes complicated (inability to read and write information, creating deviation from the process, etc.) which impacts the manufacturing complexity of a product. Because of this complexity, bottlenecks in the manufacturing and delivery schedule delays are introduced. With this in mind, test engineers always get involved in the following reviews as well: * Schematics review - to make sure all components and data/electrical paths are accessible and testable * Board layout review - to make sure all labels and components are accessible. No components are near the edges, covers, movable parts, etc. that would result into higher probability of a components being knocked off the board. * Electrical specifications review - to make sure all we can drive the needed power into the board with any fixture needed in any of the process (ICT fixture needs to make sure it can supply the appropriate power to the board without external power supplies, the Burn-In and ESS chamber can provide the required voltage and current to a number of fixtures and at the same time without modifying the chambers specs so it can mix with other products) * Diagnostics specifications review - to make sure command output formats are followed for simplification of whatever test automation tools will be developed. Also, to make sure that the commands themselves are available to test all components. Yield maintenance Products' yield plays a very important part during their lifespan.http://www.mentor.com/products/silicon-yield/techpubs/beyond-pass- fail-testing-using-failure-data-from-manufacturing-test-for-yield-27752 There are usually three stages for a product, engineering, initial production (IP) and full production (FP). * In early stages, engineering, production yield fluctuates a lot. The manufacturing process is under debugging and optimising. Foundry engineers usually work with factories to drive the yield of the product. Most companies set specific yield targets for each process to hit the expected yields. * Once the product yield is stable, usually 80%, the test engineer is responsible for advancing the product from engineering stages to initial production stages. During this period, the test engineer will monitor the production yield for a period of time, change the test program limits and even work with foundry engineer to further improve the yield. * Once the production yield is above 90%, the test engineer can turn on full production for this product, and will continue to monitor and improve production yield. In addition, yields will show if another process needs to be introduced (e.g., because processes already used cannot capture certain test errors). Yields can also decide if an existing test process can be trimmed down (step-wise or time-wise) or even fully eliminated. E.g., if the ESS errors can be captured during the 3rd hour, test time can be cut down from a normal 24 hours down to maybe 4. Or if a process consistently yields 100% during a 15-month period, teams can get together and decide to eliminate that process at all. Test automation Test automation refers to the automation of the process to test a product through the use of machines. Depending on the product, the machines that we are referring to could mean a combination of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), handler, interface board, and test program that drives the ATE, as with the case of the IC chip testing. Test automation is a big part of a test engineer's job. The whole intention of automating the test is as follows: * Enforce test steps to be followed within specifications and correct timing. * Eliminate manual command and data inputs. * Automate data gathering. * Enforce test process flow. Overall, this drives manufacturing reliability and quality at the end of the line making sure that all units shipped out to customers are well tested, stressed, filtered out of any errors, and configured properly. Defining standard test documents Following are some of the documents that the test engineers maintain or define: * Test method * Diagnostic design specification * Manufacturing test requirement design specification * Design for testability (DFT) * Design for manufacturability (DFM) * Test plan Contract manufacturer A contract manufacturer (CM) also provides a test engineer for their customers. The function of these test engineers varies depending on the level of support they provide for their customers: providing \\"interactive and first level of defense\\"-only support or providing partial or ground-up solutions. =Providing interactive and first level-of-defense support= Providing \\"interactive and first level-of-defense\\"-only support is the usual job of the CM TE. Here are some typical job functions for a CM test engineer: * Reviewing test solutions with their partnering test engineers from the customer side. * Analyzing if the infrastructure meets the requirements (from floor/line setup, network access to workstations and/or servers, operator manpower, etc.). * Getting familiar with the customer products' technology. * Being able to manage, train and support operators who performs the actual testing. * Being able to debug and isolate problems. * Gathering information to feed back to their partners. Because of their close involvement with the test line, they monitor the products going through the line and inspect the failed boards to decide if it really failed or if the failure was just caused by some improper test setup. Some examples of these false failures are: * Forgot to connect the cable to talk to the UUT (or misplacing the cable or putting it loose). This will cause the test automation to time out for any response from the UUT. * Forgot to connect the loopback cables when testing a UUT with any networking interface (ethernet/optical/etc ports). This will cause the traffic test to fail. * Skipped some test process. Some test process will configure the UUT to load some firmware or put it in some state (i.e. preparing it to run in burn-in mode) so when the test automation starts, whatever known state it is expecting will not be satisfied and thus fail. * Skipped to implement some deviations that would require hardware/software changes to the UUT. * Forgot to power up the unit right away when the test automation started. This will result to the same problem as the first item of this list. * Forgot to attach any other test fixture components. =Providing partial or ground up solutions= There is a small number of companies who prefer to outsource their test engineering work to their corresponding CM. In that case, the CM TEs will be in charge of providing the test automation solution, test fixture design, yield gathering plus the usual interactive and first level of defense for their customers. Of course, outsourcing test solutions to the CM has its pros and cons. Some of the advantages are: * Cheaper cost. Especially if the CM resides in a country where labor is at minimum. * Beneficial if the company itself doesn't have or cannot find any TE that matches the company's requirements. Some of the disadvantages are: * Getting tied up to a single CM. It is hard to find a CM that is willing to share information to another CM. * CM TEs are seldom involved with product design stage/phase. * Time constraints. They only get handed out the specs of the product during late NPI stage. Because of this, test solutions are rushed and quality are often compromised. * Conflict of interest. Company needs to know every level of information that goes through the product line in order to monitor potential problems that would one day snowball. But CM doesn't provide this level of details, they only give out how many units passed or fail for the day. A unit could have failed 5 times before it passes which may relates to some timing issues of some components of the product like the CPU or oscillators for example. The cleaner the first passed yield data that the CM provides, the better quality the unit went through the assembly line. This means that the CM would be enticed to provide the final result as their first passed yield data instead so it will reflect their higher quality side. Because it is hard to find a test engineer who knows every aspect of testing methodology (from PCB tests like ICT, JTAG test, flying probe test, and X-Ray test to PCBA test which includes writing test automation from functional test to FQA test among others), companies usually outsource part of the development of this missing test piece to their CM. For example, if none of the in-house TEs know much about ICT fixtures, they will ask their CM to develop the ICT test solutions for them instead.

Llansteffan Castle Llansteffan Castle from the beach, 1850 Llansteffan Castle Gatehouse Llansteffan Castle in 1905 Iron Age The castle sits on a much older Iron Age promontory fort, proving Llansteffan has been inhabited for several millennia. The hill where the castle stands commands the River Tywi estuary. The hill would have been stripped of trees so that foot soldiers were vulnerable to attack by archers. The original earthworks can still be seen and were used as part of the modern castle's defence system‚Äîthe castle proper rests within the earthwork rings. Conquest of West Wales The castle was built by the Normans after 1100 as part of their invasion of Wales and granted to the Marmion family before passing to the de Camvilles through marriage. It was captured by Maredudd ap Gruffydd in 1146 against the forces of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan and his brother William FitzGerald, Lord of Emlyn who were the leading Norman settlers of the region. The castle was retaken by the Normans in 1158. Llywelyn the Great recaptured the castle for the Welsh in 1215 and taken back by the de Camville family sometime after 1223. The castle fell to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1257 but returned to the de Camvilles by the 1260s. By 1367, it was described as in a poor state. Owain Glynd≈µr The castle was captured twice by the forces of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1403 and c.1405. It was recaptured by Sir John Pennes in 1408. The castle was later granted to the Crown and the two-tower Gatehouse was converted into a residence. Preservation The castle, which is privately owned, is under a deed of guardianship with Cadw.

The sound was guarded by two forts on opposite sides of the entrance, Fort Walker on Hilton Head Island to the south and Fort Beauregard on Phillip's Island to the north. A small force of four gunboats supported the forts, but did not materially affect the battle. The attacking force assembled outside of the sound beginning on November 3 after being battered by a storm during their journey down the coast. Because of losses in the storm, the army was not able to land, so the battle was reduced to a contest between ship-based guns and those on shore. The fleet moved to the attack on November 7, after more delays caused by the weather during which additional troops were brought into Fort Walker. Flag Officer Samuel F. Du Pont ordered his ships to keep moving in an elliptical path, bombarding Fort Walker on one leg and Fort Beauregard on the other; the tactic had recently been used effectively at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. His plan soon broke down, however, and most ships took enfilading positions that exploited a weakness in Fort Walker. The Confederate gunboats put in a token appearance, but fled up a nearby creek when challenged. Early in the afternoon, most of the guns in the fort were out of action, and the soldiers manning them fled to the rear. A landing party from the flagship took possession of the fort. When Fort Walker fell, the commander of Fort Beauregard across the sound feared that his soldiers would soon be cut off with no way to escape, so he ordered them to abandon the fort. Another landing party took possession of the fort and raised the Union flag the next day. Despite the heavy volume of fire, loss of life on both sides was low, at least by standards set later during the American Civil War. Only eight were killed in the fleet and eleven on shore, with four other Southerners missing. Total casualties came to less than 100. Preparations =Development of Northern strategy= Early in the war, the U.S. Navy had the responsibility of blockading the Southern coastline, but found this task difficult when forced to rely on fueling and resupply ports in the North for its coal-fired steamships. The problems of the blockade were considered by a commission appointed by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Chairman of the commission was Capt. Samuel Francis Du Pont.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 14. The Blockade Strategy Board was often called the Du Pont Board, in reference to its senior member. The commission stated its views of the South Carolina coast in its second report, dated July 13. In order to improve the blockade of Charleston, they considered seizing a nearby port. They gave particular attention to three: Bull's Bay to the north of Charleston, and St. Helena Sound and Port Royal Sound to the south. The latter two would also be useful in the blockade of Savannah. They considered Port Royal to be the best harbor, but believed that it would be strongly defended and therefore were reluctant to recommend that it be taken.ORA I, v. 53, pp. 67‚Äì73. =Southern preparations= Shortly after the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor had started the war, Confederate Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard did not believe that Port Royal Sound could be adequately defended, as forts on opposite sides of the sound would be too far apart for mutual support. Overruled by South Carolina Governor Francis Pickens, he drew up plans for two forts at the entrance. Soon called away to serve the Confederate Army in Virginia, he turned the task of implementing his plans over to Maj. Francis D. Lee of the South Carolina Army Engineers.Reed, Combined operations, p. 26. ORA I, v. 6, pp. 18-20. Before the war, Lee had been an architect, and had designed several churches in Charleston.Who was who in America, Historical volume, entry for Francis D. Lee. Work on the two forts began in July 1861, but progressed only slowly. Labor for the construction was obtained by requisitions of slave labor from local farms and plantations, which the owners were reluctant to provide. Construction was not complete when the attack came.Reed, Combined operations, p. 26. Beauregard's plan was also altered because the heavy guns he wanted were not available. To compensate for the reduced weight of fire by increased volume, the number of guns in the water battery of Fort Walker was increased from seven columbiads to 12 guns of smaller caliber, plus a single . Fitting the increased number into the available space required that the traverses be eliminated. The battery was therefore vulnerable to enfilade.Reed, Combined operations, pp. 26-27. In addition to the 13 guns of the water battery, Fort Walker had another seven guns mounted to repel land attacks from the rear and three on the right wing. Two other guns were in the fort, but were not mounted.ORN I, v. 12, p. 279. Fort Beauregard was almost as strong; it also had 13 guns that bore on the channel, plus six others for protection against land attacks.ORN I, v. 12, p. 301. The garrisons were increased in size; 687 men were in and near Fort Wagner in mid-August. On November 6, another 450 infantry and 50 artillerymen were added, and 650 more came from Georgia the same day.ORN I, v. 12, pp. 301-302. Because of its isolated position, the garrison of Fort Beauregard could not be easily increased. The force on Philip's Island was 640 men, of whom 149 were in the fort and the remainder infantry defending against land assault.ORN I, v. 12, p. 304. For lack of transportation, all of the late- arriving troops were retained at Fort Walker. While the forts were being built, the state of Georgia was forming a rudimentary navy by converting a few tugs and other harbor craft into gunboats. Although they could not face the ships of the US Navy on the open seas, their shallow draft enabled them to move freely about in the inland waters along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia. They were commanded by Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall. When the Georgia navy was transferred to and became part of the Confederate States Navy, Tattnall found himself in charge of the coastal defenses of both South Carolina and Georgia. He had four gunboats in the vicinity of Port Royal Sound; one was a converted coaster, and three were former tugs. Each mounted only two guns.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 19, 31. ORN I, v. 12, p. 295. Command =Federal army and navy= Throughout the summer of 1861, the task of blockading the entire Atlantic coast of the Confederacy was assigned to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Because of the great distances involved, the squadron was split in mid-September. Responsibility for the coast south of the North Carolina-South Carolina state line was given to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Command of the new squadron was given to Du Pont, who henceforth was addressed as Flag Officer Du Pont.\\"Flag Officer\\" was a billet, not a rank. Commanders of naval squadrons and major shore installations retained their commissioned ranks as captains, but were customarily addressed as flag officers because they flew their personal flags. Du Pont did not assume command immediately, as he continued to prepare for the attack.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 21-22, 24. As retaining possession of shore facilities would require land forces, getting the cooperation of the U.S. Army was among the first requirements. The War Department agreed to furnish 13,000 troops, to be commanded by Brigadier General Thomas W. Sherman. Sherman's force was organized into three brigades, under Brigadier Generals Egbert L. Viele, Isaac I. Stevens, and Horatio G. Wright.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 24. T. W. Sherman is not related to the more famous William Tecumseh Sherman. Serious planning was thereafter done by Du Pont, Sherman, Wright, and the Quartermaster General, Brigadier General Montgomery C. Meigs.Browning,Success is all that was expected, p. 25. =Confederate army= In the months preceding the battle, the army in South Carolina went through several changes in leadership. On May 27, 1861, Beauregard left, being called to serve with the Confederate States (CS) Army in Virginia. Command of the state volunteer forces was then transferred to Colonel Richard H. Anderson.ORA I, v. 53, pp. 176-177. Anderson was in turn replaced by Brigadier General Roswell S. Ripley of the CS Army, who on August 21, 1861 was assigned to command of the Department of South Carolina.ORA I, v. 6, p. 1. The final relevant change at the top took place almost on the eve of battle, on November 5, 1861, when the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida were constituted a military department under the command of General Robert E. Lee.ORA I, v. 6, p. 309. (General Lee was not closely related to Major Francis D. Lee, the engineer responsible for building Forts Walker and Beauregard.) None of these changes was particularly important, as most attention was given to more active parts of the war than Port Royal Sound. The most important change of command directly affecting the forts took place on October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton was assigned to the Third Military District of the Department of South Carolina, which meant that the forts were in his jurisdiction.OAR I, v. 6, pp. 6-313; ORN I, v. 12, pp. 300-307. Drayton, who was a member of a prominent Charleston family and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, remained in command through the actions of November 7. Whether he could have hastened the preparations of the forts for battle is debatable; the fact is that he did not. The expedition Although preparations for battle proceeded throughout the summer and early fall of 1861, the schedule proposed by the administration could not be met. As late as September 18, President Lincoln could still advocate a start date of October 1. Du Pont felt that the Navy Department was rushing him in without proper preparation.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 25. ORN I, v. 12, p. 208. Despite his reservations, the force was assembled -- the soldiers and their transports at Annapolis, Maryland, the sailors and warships at New York. The two branches rendezvoused at Hampton Roads. Bad weather delayed departure from there by another week, during which time Du Pont and Sherman were able to make final arrangements. Among the issues to be settled was the target; up until this time, the decision of whether to strike at Bull's Bay or Port Royal had not been made. Only after he was sure that the latter would meet future needs of the fleet, and Bull's Bay would not, did Du Pont finally commit the expedition to the attack on Port Royal.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 27-28. On October 28, 25 coal and ammunition vessels departed Hampton Roads, accompanied by two warships, and . The remainder of the fleet, including 17 warships and all of the army transports, put out to sea the next day. The full fleet of 77 vessels was the largest assemblage of ships that had ever sailed under the American flag; the distinction would not last long. In an effort to maintain secrecy, Du Pont had not told anyone other than his immediate staff the destination. He had given each captain a sealed envelope, to be opened only at sea. The message given to Captain Francis S. Haggerty of Vandalia is typical: \\"Port Royal, S. C., is the port of destination for yourself and the ships of your convoy.\\"ORN I, v. 12, p. 229. Efforts at secrecy notwithstanding, almost everything about the expedition except its target was known to the entire world. 2 days before departure of the main fleet, the New York Times carried a front-page article entitled \\"The Great Naval Expedition,\\" in which the full order of battle down to regimental level was laid out for all to see.New York Times, October 26, 1861. The article was repeated, word for word, in the Charleston newspapers of November 1. Although Du Pont and others muttered aloud about treason and leaks in high places, the article was in fact the product of straightforward journalism. The author had gained most of his information by mingling with soldiers and sailors. No one had thought to sequester the men from the populace, even though the loyalties of the citizens of Maryland and Hampton Roads were divided. (Perhaps some real espionage was also available. Although the destination was supposed to be unknown until after the fleet sailed, acting Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin on November 1 telegraphed the South Carolina authorities that \\"the enemy's expedition is intended for Port Royal.\\"Ammen, The Atlantic coast, p. 16.) The fleet maintained its formation as it moved down the coast until it had passed Cape Hatteras. As it passed into South Carolina waters on November 1, however, the wind increased to gale force, and in mid-afternoon Du Pont ordered the fleet to disregard the order of sailing.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 28. Most of the ships managed to ride out the storm, but some had to abort their mission and return home for repairs, and others were lost. Gunboat had to jettison most of her guns in order to stay afloat. Three ships carrying food and ammunition were sunk or driven ashore without loss of life: Union, Peerless, and Osceola. Transport Governor, carrying 300 Marines, went down; most of her contingent were saved, but seven men were drowned or otherwise lost in the rescue.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 29-30. ORN I, v. 12, pp. 233-235. The scattered ships began to arrive at the entrance to Port Royal Sound on November 3, and continued to straggle in for the next four days.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 29, 39. The first day, November 4, was devoted to preparing new charts for the sound. The Coast Survey vessel , under her civilian captain Charles Boutelle, accompanied by gunboats , , , and , entered the harbor and confirmed that the water was deep enough for all ships in the fleet. Confederate Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall took his small flotilla, consisting of the gunboats CSS Savannah, Resolute, Lady Davis, and Sampson out to interfere with their measurements, but the superior firepower of the Union gunboats forced them to retire.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 30-31. Early in the morning of November 5, gunboats Ottawa, Seneca, Pembina, Curlew, Isaac Smith, and , made another incursion into the harbor, this time seeking to draw enemy fire so as to gauge their strength. Again the Confederate flotilla came out to meet them, and again they were driven back.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 31. At about the time that the gunboats returned to the anchorage and the captains of the warships assembled to formulate plans for the assault on the forts, General Sherman informed Du Pont that the army could not take part in the operation. The loss of his ships in the storm had deprived him of his landing boats as well as much of his needed ammunition. Furthermore, his transports were not combat loaded. Sherman would not commit his troops until the arrival of transport Ocean Express, carrying most of his small ammunition and heavy ordnance, and delayed by the storm. She would not arrive until after the battle was over.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 32. Unwilling to cancel the operation at this point, Du Pont ordered his fleet to attack, concentrating their fire on Fort Walker. As they moved in, however, flagship , drawing , grounded on Fishing Rip Shoal. By the time she was worked free, the day was too far gone to continue the attack.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 34. The weather on the next day, November 6, was stormy, so Du Pont postponed the attack for one more day. During the delay, Commander Charles Henry Davis, Du Pont's fleet captain and chief of staff, had the idea of keeping the ships in motion while bombarding the forts. This was a tactic that had recently been used successfully at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. He presented his idea to the flag officer, who agreed. The plan as completed by Du Pont called for his fleet to enter the harbor at mid-channel. On the way in, they would engage both forts. After passing the forts, the heaviest ships would execute a turn to the left in column and go back against Fort Walker. Again past the fort, they would once more turn in column, and repeat the maneuver until the issue was decided. While the main fleet was thus engaged, five of his lighter gunboats would form a flanking column that would proceed to the head of the harbor and shield the rest of the fleet from Tattnall's flotilla.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 35.ORN I, v. 12, pp. 262-266. This report (including map) describes the battle as it would have been had it gone according to plan. For reasons of his own, Du Pont did not describe it the way it actually took place. Many historians rely on this report for their accounts of the battle. Battle A map of the battle On November 7, the air was calm and gave no further reason for delay. The fleet was drawn up into 2 columns and moved to the attack. The main body consisted of 9 ships with guns and one without. In order, they were flagship Wabash, , , Seminole, Pawnee, , Ottawa, Pembina, Isaac Smith, and Vandalia. Isaac Smith had jettisoned her guns during the storm, but she would now contribute by towing the sailing vessel Vandalia. Five gunboats formed the flanking column: , Seneca, Penguin, Curlew, and . Three other gunboats, , Mercury, and Penguin remained behind to protect the transports.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 35-36. The fight started at 09:26, when a gun in Fort Walker fired on the approaching fleet. (This first shell exploded harmlessly a short distance out of the muzzle.) Other shots followed, the fleet replied by firing on both forts, and the action became general. Shells from the fleet ripped into the forts, although many of them passed harmlessly overhead and landed well beyond. Because the motion of the ships disrupted their aim, most of the shots from the forts missed; generally, they aimed too high, sending the missiles that were on target into the masts and upper works of the vessels. The ships proceeded according to Du Pont's orders through the first turn, but then the plan fell apart. First to leave was the third ship in the main column, Mohican, under Commander Sylvanus W. Godon. Godon found that he could enfilade the water battery from a position safe from return fire, so he dropped out. Those following him were confused, so they also dropped out. Only Wabash and Susquehanna continued in the line of battle. The two ships made their second and third passes, and then were joined, inexplicably, by gunboat Bienville.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 38. Bombardment of Port Royal The bombardment continued in this way until shortly after noon, when , delayed by the storm, put in her appearance. Her captain, Commander Percival Drayton, placed the ship in position to enfilade Fort Walker and joined the battle. Commander Drayton was the brother of Thomas F. Drayton, the Confederate general who commanded the forces ashore.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 39. Ashore, Fort Walker was suffering, with most of the damage being done by the ships that had dropped out of the line of battle. The exhausted gunners had only three guns left in the water battery, the others being disabled. About 12:30, General Drayton left the fort to collect some reserves to replace the men in the fort. Before leaving, he turned command over to Colonel William C. Heyward, with instructions to hold out as long as possible. As he was returning at 14:00, he found the men leaving the fort. They explained that they were almost out of powder for the guns, and had therefore abandoned their position.ORN I, v. 12, p. 303. The departure of the soldiers from the fort was noticed by sailors in the fleet, and signal was soon passed to cease fire. A boat crew led by Commander John Rodgers went ashore under a flag of truce and found the fort abandoned. Rodgers therefore raised the Union flag.Browning, Success is all that was expected, p. 40. No effort was made to further press the men who had just left the fort, so the entire surviving Confederate force was permitted to escape to the mainland. Fort Beauregard had not suffered punishment as severe as that given to Fort Walker, but Colonel Robert Gill Mills Dunovant was concerned that the enemy could easily cut off his only line of retreat. When the firing at Fort Walker ceased and cheering in the fleet was heard, he realized that his command was in peril. Rather than be trapped, he ordered the troops on Philip's Island to abandon their positions. This they did without destroying their stores, because to do so would have attracted the attention of the fleet. Their departure was not noted, and not until a probing attack by gunboat Seneca elicited no reply was it realized that the fort was unmanned. As it was then very late in the day, raising the Union flag on Fort Beauregard was delayed until the following morning.Ammen, Atlantic coast, pp. 28-29. The \\"commanding officer of the Seneca\\" to whom he refers was Lieutenant Daniel Ammen. Aftermath Stars and Stripes over Fort Walker The battle being over, personnel losses could be determined. Despite the large expenditure of shot and shell by both sides, casualties were rather light. In the Southern forts, 11 men had been killed, 47 were wounded, and 4 were missing.ORN I, v. 12, p. 306. In the Northern fleet, 8 were killed and 23 wounded. These numbers do not include those lost in the sinking of transport Governor.ORN I, v. 12, p. 266. Immediately following the capture of the forts, the Union forces consolidated their victory by occupying Beaufort, and then moved north by next taking St. Helena Sound. The northward expansion continued up to the rivers on the south side of Charleston, where it was halted. Thus, the siege of Charleston, which continued until the last days of the war, can be said to have been initiated at Port Royal Sound.ORN I, v. 12, pp. 319-324, 386-390. General Lee, who had been placed in command too late to affect the battle, decided that he would not contest the Union gunboats. He withdrew his forces from the coast and defended only vital interior positions. He was able to thwart Federal efforts to cut the vital railroad link between Savannah and Charleston.ORA I, v. 6, p. 367. Lee's strategy was maintained even after he was recalled to Richmond and given command of the Army of Northern Virginia, where he earned his fame. Flag Officer Du Pont was widely honored for his part in the victory. When the rank of rear admiral was created for the U.S. Navy in July 1862, he was the second person (after David G. Farragut) to be promoted. He retained command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and directed continuing naval operations against the coast, including Charleston, Savannah, and Fernandina, Florida. To that end, he set up extensive works at Port Royal Sound for maintaining the fleet, including coaling, provisioning, and repair facilities.Browning, Success is all that was expected, pp. 77ff. Unfortunately, Du Pont proved to be unduly cautious, and his reputation could not survive the failure of the fleet attack on Charleston of April 7, 1863. He soon thereafter retired from the service.Faust, Encyclopedia of the Civil War, entry for Samuel Francis Du Pont. General Sherman continued to serve in various capacities throughout the war, but without distinction. His abrasive personality made him difficult to work with, so he was shunted off to lesser commands. He lost his right leg in combat at Port Hudson.Faust, Encyclopedia of the Civil War, entry for Thomas West Sherman. Pontoon bridge erected for the evacuation After a Union victory, Confederate Brigadier-General Thomas F. Drayton directed the evacuation of rebel forces from Hilton Head Island to the Bluffton mainland. Occupying Port Royal Harbor, the Union‚Äôs South Atlantic Blockading Squadron could then be monitored by rebel lookouts disbursed from Bluffton‚Äôs substantial picket headquarters. Bluffton‚Äôs geographic location resulted in it being the only strategic position on the east coast where the Confederates could gather direct intelligence on the Union squadron, which conducted crucial blockade operations along the southern coastline in the aftermath of the battle.Jeff Fulgham, The Bluffton Expedition: The Burning of Bluffton, South Carolina, During the Civil War (Bluffton, S.C.: Jeff Fulgham, 2012), 46‚Äì51. General Drayton proved to be incompetent in the field, so he was put in various administrative positions.Faust, Encyclopedia of the Civil War, entry for Thomas Fenwick Drayton.

Wine competitions generally use blind tasting of wine to prevent bias by the judges. Types of wine competitions The common goal of all wine competitions is to obtain valid comparisons of wines by trained experts. Wine competitions can vary widely in their characteristics, and are sometimes geared toward a specific audience (i.e., consumers vs. industry professionals). One of the ways wine competitions can vary is how the wines are ranked. In most competitions, medals are given to individual wines in various categories on the basis of the blind tasting. The awards are frequently bronze, silver, gold, and double gold medals. In other competitions, ribbons of various colors are sometimes used. In these competitions, it is common for more than one wine to receive any given medal. These competitions often also include a \\"Best in Class\\" award, producing a clear category winner among those vintages awarded any particular medal, as seen in the Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition, the New York International Wine Competition, and The Decanter World Wine Awards.Decanter World Wine Awards 2016 Winners In still other competitions, instead of giving numerous awards, the wines in each wine category are ranked by number from high to low, a process known as ordinal ranking. In these competitions, there is only one first-place winner, one second place, one third place, and so on down to the lowest place. Medal rankings are different from the 100 point scales that are used by many journalistic publications, such as Wine Spectator. These \\"scores\\" are obtained when wine journalists blind taste the wines and score them on an individual basis, as opposed to when the wines are being tasted side by side and competing against one another in a competition setting. There are critics who argue that the results of such competitions may be misleading and should not be relied upon as a measure of quality.Orley Ashenfelter and Richard E. Quandt Analyzing a Wine Tasting Statistically Other commentators argue that, because of wine competitions, wine quality has improved in many countries around the world. International wine competitions An \\"international\\" wine competition is a competition that accepts wines from all over the world. Competitions are generally held in one location and winemakers must ship their wines to the competition in order to be considered. There is generally an entry fee for winemakers to enter their wines into the competition. Below are some examples of top international wine competitions: * New York International Wine Competition an annual international wine competition held in New York City where the top wine buyers, sommeliers, importers, and distributors judge the wine by its category and actual price. The New York International Wine Competition is held in May and is open to all commercially produced wine from around the world. It is part of the International Beverage Competition series of competitions. * Berlin International Wine Competition is an annual competition in held in Berlin where top European Wine Buyers including sommeliers, importers, distributors, restaurant owners, and retail store buyers judge the wine by its category and actual price as if they are buying it for their business. The Berlin International Wine Competition is part of the International Beverage Competition Group founded by Adam Levy the Alcohol Professor. * Decanter World Wine Awards(DWWA): Founded in 2004, the London-based competition now receives entries from over 47 countries worldwide and in 2014 received over 15,000 entries, making it the largest wine competition in the world. The results of the competition are published online and in print in Decanter's August Edition, which is released in July. Chaired by Steven Spurrier, the DWWA brings together over 200 of the world's wine experts including 66 Masters of Wine and Master Sommeliers. * International Wine Challenge (IWC): Annual British-based wine competition, originally launched by Robert Joseph and Charles Metcalfe in 1984 when they wanted to see how a set of English wines fared when set against examples from other countries. Metcalfe and Joseph presided over the growth in the competition to claim to be the largest in the world, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s Joseph launched International Wine Challenges in Hong Kong, China (Shanghai and Beijing), Singapore, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Russia, Poland and India. Joseph resigned at the end of 2006, following the sale of the competition to William Reed Business Media. The UK IWC is still chaired by Charles Metcalfe and a team of eminent wine judges, including Oz Clarke and Tim Atkin MW. The results are published at the London Wine Fair and the Awards Dinner is held in the autumn. * International Wine and Spirit Competition: Established in 1969, this competition uses over 400 experts to judge products for 7 months out of the year. It is considered to be one of the oldest and most prestigious wine and spirits competitions in the world. * London Wine Competition: The London Wine Competition identifies and rewards those brands and products that consumers actually want to buy, rather than simply recognise good quality wines for their winemaking ability alone. To be a real success a wine brand has to be bought by consumers, be it on a supermarket shelf or a restaurant or bar's list. The London Wine Competition rates its wines by drinkability, value and packaging. * Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards (MIWA): Established in 1997, the MIWA is the only wine competition in South Africa in which all the judges are internationally accredited wine judges. Since 1997 a total of 269 judges from 45 countries have served on the judging panels. Founded by owner and managing director, Lorraine Immelman, the competition annually receives between 1800 and 2000 entries from South Africa as well as other wine- producing countries. These are judged blind to determine the winners of 16 trophies as well as platinum, Gran d'Or, gold and silver medals. Trophies are awarded to particular category or class winners, including Best International Entry, Best Brandy, Best Garagiste Entry, Best Methode Classique, Best Pinotage and Most Innovative Wine/Spirits. Held in Stellenbosch in the Western Cape, the competition introduced the Michelangelo Liqueur Awards in 2014 and is also open to entries from spirits producers (incl vodka, gin, rum and grappa). * International Wine Contest: A competition organized since 1961 in Brussels by Monde Selection, an international quality institute. * Concours Mondial de Bruxelles: Translating to the \\"Wine World Championships,\\" this competition boasts more than 9000 participating products from four continents. As a whole, these samples represent more than 500 million marketed bottles. * International Value Wine Awards: (2006-2013) Had the specific goal of determining the finest value wines in the world available to Canadians. The awards were organized and operated by Wine Access magazine. It achieved recognition worldwide. * Best Wine of the World competition Established in 2017, BWW is the largest and most important wine competition in the world in terms of amount of wines, consumers and professionals. The BWW competition is founded by Pekka Nuikki, and is organized and operated by the world's leading Fine Wine magazines - FINE Magazines and the world's largest wine information source Tastingbook.com. The 2017 BWW -competition received over 1.3 million public votes for 22.588 wines. * Mundus Vini: The international wine award founded by Meininger Verlag was first held in 2001 in Germany. Every year 11,000 wines are submitted to be tasted from all over the world. The competition is held twice annually in the city of Neustadt an der weinstrasse, Germany, with a summer tasting in August and a spring tasting in February. *Ukraine Wine&Spirits; Awards: International tasting competition for wines and spirits from all around the world is held annually in Kyiv alongside with Wine&Spirits; Ukraine Exhibition in accordance with the international standards of the OIV. The aim of the competition is to improve the quality of production and culture of consumption of wines and spirits and provide to producers an effective tool for promoting their products on the Ukrainian market. The best Ukrainian and World's Sommeliers deliver an independent expert verdict on the wines and spirits entered. Local competitions Some wine competitions only accept wines from a specific region or appellation. Sometimes this is because they are newer and don't have the resources to manage or hold a large number of entries from outside of their region, but most often it is because the organizers want to draw attention to their specific winemaking region. Some examples of local competitions are: *Top 100 Sud de France: A French competition annually selecting 100 wines from over 660 entries from the French Languedoc-Roussillon wine region. The judging panel is made up of 22 UK experts chaired by Master of Wine Tim Atkin.Top 100 Sud de France website *Grand Harvest Awards: An annual competition held in California, that only allows wines to be judged alongside other wines in their particular terroir. *Atlantic Seaboard Wine Association Wine Competition: An annual competition held in Virginia, inviting wines from the Atlantic Seaboard region to participate. Historic competitions There have been numerous occasions when wine tastings had shocking results that influenced the wine industry as a whole. The most famous of these is the Judgment of Paris (wine). Other examples: * New York Wine Tasting of 1973: A one-time competitive tasting event organized by wine journalist Robert Lawrence Balzer. Fourteen experts, including France's Alexis Lichine blind tasted and ranked 23 Chardonnays from France, California, and New York State. The results shocked the world‚Äîthe top four scores went to California wines, which had previously been marginalized by the wine industry. * Paris Wine Tasting of 1976: This notable event is known as the \\"Judgment of Paris.\\" It was a very significant advancement for the United States' wine industry in their efforts to be recognized on the international level. 20 wines were tasted, French and American, both red and white, and the top two wines were both American‚Äîa result which shocked the world. The tasting was repeated at the San Francisco Wine Tasting of 1978 and at the tenth anniversary Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986 and French Culinary Institute Wine Tasting of 1986. * Wine Olympics (1979): A French food and wine magazine organized a competition of 330 wines from 33 countries evaluated by 62 experts. * The Tasting that Changed the Wine World: 'The Judgment of Paris' 30th Anniversary. A 30-year anniversary replication of the 1976 Paris competition. * Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997: European jury tasted three vintages (1989, 1992 and 1994) of 27 Chardonnays from seven countries. * Great Chardonnay Showdown (1980): A total of 221 Chardonnays from around the world were evaluated by 25 judges.

In the United States, the term status offense also refers to an offense such as a traffic violation where motive is not a consideration in determining guilt. In the United Kingdom and Europe, this type of status offense may be termed a regulatory offense. Usage Definitions of status offense vary. A neutral definition may be \\"[a] type of crime that is not based upon prohibited action or inaction but rests on the fact that the offender has a certain personal condition or is of a specified character.\\"Definition of status offense Enotes.com The Federal Sentencing Guidelines states that a juvenile status offense is a crime which cannot be committed by an adult.U.S.S.G. ¬ß 4A1.2(c)(2). For example, possession of a firearm by a minor, by definition, cannot be done by an adult. In some states the term \\"status offense\\" does not apply to adults at all; according to Wyoming law, status offenses can be committed only by people under 18 years of age.(2002)Working Draft. State of Wyoming. Juvenile status offenders are distinguished from juvenile delinquent offenders in that status offenders have not committed an act that would be considered a crime if it were committed by an adult, whereas delinquent youths have committed such an act.Juvenile Status Offenders. Some sexting laws and broadly interpreted child pornography laws have effectively made sexting by a minor into a status offense, but it is treated by the legal system as a criminal offense, punishable by long prison terms and large fines. It is de facto a status offense since an adult is allowed to possess a nude image of themselves but a minor is not allowed to possess or distribute a nude image of themselves. Examples Status offenses may include consumption of alcohol, truancy, and running away from home. These acts may be illegal for persons under a certain age, while remaining legal for all others, which makes them status offenses. Status offense may also apply to other classes, including laws forbidding ownership of firearms by felons, where such ownership is otherwise legal. Laws that prohibit certain actions to certain persons based on their sex, race, nationality, religion, etc., are also status offenses. A law that prohibits men from using public toilets intended for women, as well as a law that sets a curfew for people below a certain age, are examples of status offenses. Status offenses from the past that are no longer operative include: *The Nuremberg Laws (Germany, 1935‚Äì1945) banned sexual relations between Jews and non-Jewish Germans. *Various laws in the United States prohibited marriage (and, in some cases, sexual relations) between white people and African-Americans (and, in some cases, Asians and Native Americans). These were enacted at the state level; some states had anti- miscegenation laws and some did not. The first of these laws was enacted in 1691 in Virginia and the last were voided in 1967 in the Loving v. Virginia case. *South Africa's Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act (1949‚Äì1985) prohibited sexual relations (as well as marriages) between people of different races. *Various other places, at other times, have promulgated anti- miscegenation laws prohibiting sexual relations between members of specified different races.

Montgomery (born May 30, 1951) is an American author, geoscientist, public lecturer, and affiliate faculty member at the University of Washington in Seattle. He is widely known for his writings on energy matters, intellectual history, language and translation, and history of science. His book, The Shape of the New: Four Big Ideas and How They Built the Modern World (2015), with co-author Daniel Chirot, was selected by The New York Times and Bloomberg Businessweek as one of the most notable books of 2015. His articles have appeared in many journals, including Forbes, Newsweek, History Today, Science, and Nature.  Early life and education  Scott Lyons Montgomery was born on May 30, 1951, the son of Kay C. Montgomery and Shirley Lyons Montgomery, in Ithaca New York. His father was an experimental psychologist (PhD, University of Chicago, 1948), who had done research at Harvard and Cornell Universities before moving to Yale. An unfortunate series of incidents led to the father committing suicide in 1956. Scott and his brother, Bruce, were raised by their mother, eventually moving to Kensington, Maryland in the Washington D.C. area. She remarried In 1971, to Russell Allen. Scott attended Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland and then went to Knox College (Galesburg, Illinois). At Knox, he majored in chemistry for the first several years, spending a semester at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, then switched to English, graduating _Phi Beta Kappa_. He entered a PhD program in geological sciences at Cornell University, deciding to finish with an M.S. degree when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After her death in 1979, he moved to Japan, where he taught English in a private Tokyo academy and immersed himself in Japanese culture and language.  Career  Returning to the U.S. in 1982, he found work in the energy industry as a petroleum geoscientist and as a translator of scientific material (Japanese to English). He worked both as an independent consulting geologist and writer/editor, performing contract work for companies, investors, energy funds, and other entities. During a stint with Petroleum Information Corp., and on a contract basis after leaving the company, he wrote a monograph series, Petroleum Frontiers, eventually completing 74 individual volumes. During a year with International Human Resources Development Corp. (IHRDC), he authored two textbooks, Structural Geology and Exploration for Marginal Marine Sandstones. In 1995, he was selected by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), the world's premier scientific organization of the energy industry, to author a new series of technical papers in the AAPG Bulletin titled \\"E&P; [Exploration & Production] Notes.\\" Between 1995 and 2002, Montgomery wrote approximately 50 of these papers, which gained a wide international readership and set a new standard for concise analyses of oil and gas plays. Many of these papers continue to be widely read two decades after they were published. He also contributed articles to various trade journals, special technical volumes, and symposia. During this time, Montgomery began work as an independent scholar, publishing essays, articles, and books on themes that involved both science and the humanities. He continued his two careers for more than a decade, adding a third in 2004, becoming an affiliate faculty member in the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington (Seattle). In 2008, he ceased work as a consulting geologist in the energy industry and expanded his teaching on energy-related subjects, climate change, English as a global language, and intellectual history. He was honored with the Jackson School Student Service teaching award in 2015.  Writings  Montgomery's first book, Minds for the Making (1994) examined the history of science education in the U.S., as a subset of education generally and the social and culture debates that have surrounded it. His next two works, The Scientific Voice (1996) and The Moon and the Western Imagination (1998) dealt with topics in the language of science and the role of art and other imagery in scientific contexts. These were followed by Science and Translation: Movements of Knowledge Through Cultures and Time (2000). This proved to be a pioneering study on the central role of translation in the history of science. Translation scholar and professor of comparative literature Maria Tymoczko wrote in an essay-review for the journal Isis: > [H]is approach to the subject matter gives a new entryway into the large > questions he tackles. His lens of investigation--translation--is a brilliant > choice. There is a predisposition to believe--indeed, it is a myth > assiduously cultivated by scientists--that science is somehow transparent to > language and culture. By tracing the transformations of scientific knowledge > as it is transferred from language to language and culture to culture > through translation, Montgomery establishes the materialistic bases of > science, as well as the dependency of science on language and other cultural > frameworks... The book has been translated into a number of languages and has been used as a text in courses taught at universities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia (China, Japan, Korea). More recently, Montgomery's Does Science Need a Global Language? offered a detailed, unparalleled look at the role of English as a global lingua franca in science today and what this means for the scientific community. Praised for its nuanced approach and use of history (discussing past lingua franca of science, such as Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese), the book has also been controversial because of its insistence that the global use of English has grown to the point where it is part of science itself, has more pros than cons, and should no longer be viewed as linked to the status and power of the U.S. At the same time, the book spends much space discussing the inequities and biases that have accompanied the rise of English, the impacts on other languages, and also the struggles that many non-anglophone scientists are forced to bear. In an essay- review published in Science, Yael Peled says that the book builds its case \\"on a comprehensive body of research not only in the history of science but also in linguistics,\\" and that the book raises important questions about \\"the complex interplay between science, power, and language.\\" In 2015, Montgomery and co-author, Dan Chirot, also in the Jackson School of International Studies (University of Washington), published The Shape of the New: Four Big Ideas and How They Built the Modern World, a work of significant and growing influence. The main premise of this wide-ranging and well-written book is that ideas ‚Äúdo not merely matter; they matter immensely, as...the source for decisions and actions that have structured the modern world.‚Äù Whether ideas or a combination of other actors, especially individuals, desire for power, and the response to events, form the driving force(s) behind history has been a long-standing debate within the historical profession. According to Montgomery and Chirot, the role of ideas‚Äîthose of the Enlightenment in particular‚Äîhas been too often ignored or belittled in recent decades due to such tendencies as the preference for realpolitik explanations and blanket criticism of Enlightenment thought from left-wing academics who view such thought as the origin of most modern evils, especially colonialism, racism, genderism, etc. Montgomery and Chirot, however, citing other scholars on this period, view the Enlightenment as a time of unending debate and diversity of thought, out of which ideas about individual freedom and rights, democracy, economic reality, scientific effort, and the need to reform society all emerged. Shape of the New takes up a vast territory of texts, institutions, speeches, events, and much more. Writing in the New York Times Book Review, Fareed Zakaria stated > They have to cover an immense range of material, from economics to evolution > to Islamic fundamentalism. But they do so comprehensively, intelligently and > with nuance and judiciousness. I was struck again and again by the > extraordinary breadth, erudition and lucidity of this book. Briefly put, the book examines four major domains of thought via fundamental thinkers: Adam Smith in economic freedom; Darwin in biology; Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in democratic government; and Karl Marx in human equality. The treatment includes tracing the history of how these expanded in influence through the 19th and 20th century, examining their diverse impacts up to the present time. The authors' key point is that ideas like democratic freedom and economic liberty are no less alive and fought over today than 200 years ago, and this will not stop. Needless to say, this is no less true for Darwin and for Marx. As Zakaria notes, \\"For almost a century, hundreds of millions studied [Marx's] work as gospel. Powerful nations like the Soviet Union and Maoist China organized themselves around his theories. In most other societies, politics were defined and organized in opposition to his views.\\" After their chapters on these thinkers, the authors turn to reactions against them, in the form of religious fundamentalisms (Christianity and Islam), totalitarianism, fascism, and forms of reactionary rejection. A powerful argument is made that none of this is over and done with. On the contrary, the attacks on liberal democracy, economic freedom, Darwinian evolution, and equality are all ongoing realities. Shape of the New shows why this is the case. The book also makes the argument that the humanities are necessary today because ideas are their \\"stock and trade.\\" No one should emerge from a college education without having read and talked about Smith's Wealth of Nations or Darwin's Origin of Species, it states. This view may not be welcomed by everyone, but it makes more than a little sense. In 2017, Montgomery and co- author Thomas Graham Jr., a long-time U.S. negotiator on nuclear arms limitations and world-renowned expert on non-proliferation, published Seeing the Light: The Case for Nuclear Power in the 21st Century (Cambridge), a new and innovative examination of the pros and cons of this energy source in the era of climate change and lethal air pollution. In more than a few places, the book goes over well-trod ground by discussing the history of nuclear weapons, major non-proliferation issues, the threat of climate change, and the development of different reactor designs. Where the book breaks new ground is in its detailed and well-researched chapters on Chernobyl & Fukushima, radiation (with an especially revealing section, \\"A Plane-Trip to Kerala,\\" about natural background radiation levels), and an in-depth discussion of common attacks against nuclear power. Its introduction to nuclear science cleverly uses the life and career of Ernest Rutherford as a lens to talk about key concepts. Doubtless the most original chapter takes up the origins of what Spencer Weart, in the title of his 1988 his book, called Nuclear Fear (1988). Where Weart looked mainly at imagery and popular culture, Montgomery and Graham fill out the picture by examining the political, sociological, and philosophical dimension of how nuclear power became embodied with a variety of threats attached to anger and concern over government, corporate, and military power, environmental damage, and western society's self-destructive aspects.

The film co-stars Nat Faxon, Will Forte, Ralf M√∂ller, Mo'Nique, Eric Christian Olsen, J√ºrgen Prochnow, Cloris Leachman. Beerfest was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was theatrically released on August 25, 2006. Plot At the funeral of their German-born grandfather Johann von Wolfhausen, brothers Jan and Todd Wolfhouse discover that family tradition demands that they travel to Munich on Oktoberfest to spread his cremated ashes at the Theresienwiese. There, the brothers unintentionally start an altercation that takes down an entire Oktoberfest tent. They then participate in Beerfest, an underground drinking game tournament run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen, where they discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team angrily denies the family ties, revealing that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for \\"the greatest beer in all ze world\\" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother (the brothers' great grandmother), Great Gam Gam. Enraged by the mockery of their ancestors, Jan and Todd challenge the Germans to a drinking game. The brothers' defeat humiliates them in front of everybody, with Wolfgang pouring their grandfather's ashes on them and Jan getting punched in the eye. Swearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to Colorado where they recruit their drinking friends from college‚Äîbinge drinker Phil \\"Landfill\\" Krundle, Jewish scientist Charlie \\"Fink\\" Finklestein, and male prostitute Barry Badrinath‚Äîto assemble an American Beerfest team, though they do not divulge this to Great Gam Gam. During the team's year of training, Jan and Todd find out that their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe, but was actually the rightful heir to the family brewery in Bavaria. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer, whose delicious taste fills them with awe. After the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to take the recipe back. Following a confrontation between the Wolfhausens and Jan and Todd, the Wolfhausens forge evidence that the brothers' restaurant has health issues to put them out of business. Fink quits the team, having been fired due to a slipping performance at the lab. Meanwhile, Landfill catches Great Gam Gam's caregiver Cherry stealing the beer recipe for the Germans. He overwhelms Cherry in a fight, but is pushed into a vat full of beer that drowns him due to the yeast ingredient submerging him. Minutes later, Jan discovers Landfill's body. Thinking Landfill committed suicide due to his wife taking their kids and leaving him earlier because of the strain that his involvement was putting on their marriage (which was also the reason he quit the team), the team decides to disband. After the funeral, Great Gam Gam reveals that she knew about Beerfest the entire time. She then motivates the bereaved team with a rousing speech, and everyone except Barry change their minds. Barry explains that he cannot join due to a traumatizing incident years ago during a game of table tennis, in which a racket was forcefully shoved up his anus. Sympathizing with Barry, Great Gam Gam encourages him to rise above it, causing him to relent and join the team. Shortly after, Landfill's Southern twin brother Gil reveals himself to the group and offers to join the team, which they accept. Like his brother, Gil can drink copious amounts of beer and he even invites the other members of the team to call him \\"Landfill\\" in honor of his dead brother. In Germany, the team uses an empty wooden keg as a Trojan Horse to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals (bootline chug), Cherry gibes Gil about the death of his brother, causing him to crack and the Germans to win. Jan offers the Germans a double or nothing opportunity. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out that Cherry only stole a recipe for a low-carbohydrate strawberry beer, prompting Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink's yarmulke, he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage (the \\"Eye of the Jew\\") which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team's anchor fails to finish \\"Das Boot\\" (Boot of beer) by one drop.

They have stated both that fans were very supportive of the title and that Broken Lizard may decide to make an animated film of the same name.Steve Head. Exclusive: Broken Lizard on the Road to Potfest? , IGN, December 8, 2006. In July 2012, Broken Lizard member Jay Chandraskehar revealed the Smokefest might actually happen, and that Willie Nelson, Cheech of Cheech & Chong and Snoop Dogg agreed to appear in the movie. In June 2013, it was confirmed that the movie would be released after Super Troopers 2. In 2014, it was confirmed that it would be a live action film rather than the proposed animated film. It was later announced , in 2016, that a Beerfest TV series will air on CW Seed. As of October 2020 there has been no further announcements on the future of the project. Different versions Two versions of the film have been released: The theatrical version and the unrated version. The unrated version runs ten minutes longer than the theatrical version and includes another eight brief scenes. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 5.04/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Beerfest features some laugh-inducing gags, but is too long and the pacing too uneven to form a coherent, functioning comedy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

He played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 years with three teams: the St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Oilers, and Denver Broncos. College career A native of Big Spring, Texas, Johnson initially was set to play football with a scholarship at Schreiner Institute, but the school dropped football the season he arrived. He then transferred to New Mexico State University, but did so with a scholarship to play basketball instead and had to walk-on to play football there, though he eventually won the starting job at quarterback. During his college football career at New Mexico State he became the only person to date to be named Most Valuable Player of the Sun Bowl in consecutive years, winning the award in 1959 and 1960. He is a member of the NMSU Sports Hall of Fame and is the only player in the history of the NMSU football program to have his jersey number (33) retired. Professional career He was a late-round draft pick by both the San Diego Chargers of the AFL and St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL, opting to go to St. Louis. After just 13 attempts his 1961 rookie season, he became the Cardinal's primary starter for the next five years. He was named to the NFL Pro Bowl in 1963 after career-bests 3,280 passing yards and 28 passing touchdowns, and was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated twice, on the December 14, 1964 and November 1, 1965. In 1964, he led the league with 223 completions, 420 attempts, 3,045 passing yards, and 24 interceptions. In 1966, he had a league-leading four 4th quarter comebacks. He played back-up to Jim Hart in 1967, and despite starting just two games, again led the league with two 4th quarter comebacks in 1968. He split time with Hart in 1969 before being traded to Houston. There he started 14 games in two seasons (1970‚Äì71), before ending his career with a four-year stint in Denver. He started 9 games for the Broncos in 1972, and all 14 games for the 7‚Äì5‚Äì2 squad in 1973. In 1974, his 14th season, he led the league for the first time in yards per attempt with 8.1. He began his final year with a 90-yard touchdown pass to Rick Upchurch against the Kansas City Chiefs, the only 90+ yard pass that decade by a Bronco.See List of 90+ passing TDs by Broncos. , his 16.45 yards per attempt in the game remains a franchise record, and he is a member of the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame Johnson appeared as an imposter on the February 14, 1966 episode of the CBS game show To Tell the Truth. He revealed his true identity after receiving one vote. He retired in 1975 with a 59‚Äì57‚Äì8 record as a starter, with 1,737 completions (at the time, ranked 13th all-time in professional football) on 3,392 attempts (13th), for 24,410 yards (14th), 170 touchdowns (15th), 181 interceptions (14th) and a passer rating of 69.2 (20th).See pro-football-reference.com lists. Outside of football An engineering major at NMSU, Johnson obtained his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at NMSU with a 4.0 GPA in 1961. Johnson then continued his academic pursuits during his NFL career and obtained master's and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis while concurrently playing in the NFL. While an undergraduate, Johnson was part of NMSU's Army ROTC; he used his graduate studies to delay his commission until 1967, when he was called into active duty. He was deemed unfit for combat, but was stationed with and worked for NASA as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve for two years (while simultaneously still playing for the Cardinals and working on his doctoral studies). After his football career and military service were over, he worked in industry, opening Johnson Compression Services in Houston in 1981 and working as an engineering and product development consultant until 1999.

Established in 1845, Carolina Law is among the oldest law schools in the United States and is the oldest law school in North Carolina. It is consistently ranked in the top-tier of law schools, its U.S. News current rank being tied for number 27. , the law school has 634 enrolled students and a student-faculty ratio of 11.3 to 1. The entering class of first-year law students in 2017 was composed of 213 students from 25 states, the District of Columbia, and China. Sixty-three percent of students were from North Carolina, and students of color made up 26 percent of the class. Fifty-one percent of incoming students were female, while 49% were male. History Following discussion in the North Carolina legal community, on December 12, 1842, the Trustees of the University of North Carolina authorized the University President, David L. Swain, to review and establish a law professorship. In 1845, William Horn Battle was named the first professor of law, and legal instruction began at the university.History In the years following, assistant professors and later an organized faculty and law library were added. In 1915, Margaret Berry became the first female to graduate from the law school. In the 1920s, the school began taking on much of the character of a modern law school, after the American Bar Association first published guidelines for schools. University President Harry Woodburn Chase was instrumental in leading the efforts for this reorganization over notable opposition, including the governor of North Carolina.Coates , Albert, The Story of the Law School of the University of North Carolina, North Carolina Law Review 47, Oct. 1968 Special Issue In June 1951, Harvey Beech, J. Kenneth Lee, Floyd McKissick, and James Robert Walker Jr. became the first four black students enrolled at the law school. McKissick and other black students had argued in court that a state law school for blacks in Durham was not equal to that in Chapel Hill. In March 1951, a U.S. Court of Appeals agreed and ordered UNC to stop excluding black applicants.Carolina to Celebrate 50 Years of African-American Students Sylvia X.

Bottom: Its discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) and the 3 non-zero values of its discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The Fourier transform of w_0(x) is given by: :W_0(f) = tfrac{1}{2}frac{sin(pi Lf)}{pi f(1 - L^2f^2)} An equivalent expression is found from the formulation as a linear combination of modulated rectangular windows: :mathrm{rect}(x/L)quad stackrel{text{Fourier transform}}{longleftrightarrow}quad Lcdot mathrm{sinc}(Lf) = frac{sin(pi L f)}{pi f}. Using Euler's formula to expand the cosine term, we can write: :w_0(x)= tfrac{1}{2}mathrm{rect}(x/L) +tfrac{1}{4} e^{i 2pi x/L} mathrm{rect}(x/L) + tfrac{1}{4}e^{-i 2pi x/L} mathrm{rect}(x/L), whose Fourier transform is just: :W_0(f) = tfrac{1}{2}frac{sin(pi Lf)}{pi f} + tfrac{1}{4} frac{sin(pi L(f-1/L))}{pi (f-1/L)} + tfrac{1}{4} frac{sin(pi L(f+1/L))}{pi (f+1/L)}.  Discrete transforms  The Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the N+1 length, time-shifted sequence is defined by a Fourier series, which also has a 3-term equivalent that is derived similarly to the Fourier transform derivation: : begin{align} mathcal{F}{w[n]} &triangleq sum_{n=0}^{N} w[n]cdot e^{-i 2 pi f n} &= e^{-i pi f N}left[tfrac{1}{2} frac{sin(pi(N+1)f)}{sin(pi f)} + tfrac{1}{4} frac{sin(pi(N+1)(f-tfrac{1}{N}))}{sin(pi (f-tfrac{1}{N}))} + tfrac{1}{4} frac{sin(pi(N+1)(f+tfrac{1}{N}))}{sin(pi (f+tfrac{1}{N}))}right]. end{align} For even values of N, the truncated sequence {w[n], 0 le n le N-1} is a DFT-even (aka periodic) Hann window. Since the truncated sample has value zero, it is clear from the Fourier series definition that the DTFTs are equivalent. However, the approach followed above results in a significantly different-looking, but equivalent, 3-term expression: :mathcal{F}{w[n]} = e^{-i pi f (N-1)}left[tfrac{1}{2} frac{sin(pi N f)}{sin(pi f)} + tfrac{1}{4} e^{-ipi/N} frac{sin(pi N (f-tfrac{1}{N}))}{sin(pi (f-tfrac{1}{N}))} + tfrac{1}{4} e^{ipi/N} frac{sin(pi N (f+tfrac{1}{N}))}{sin(pi (f+tfrac{1}{N}))}right]. An N-length DFT of the window function samples the DTFT at frequencies f = k/N, for integer values of k. From the expression immediately above, it is easy to see that only 3 of the N DFT coefficients are non-zero. And from the other expression, it is apparent that all are real- valued. These properties are appealing for real-time applications that require both windowed and non-windowed (rectangularly windowed) transforms, because the windowed transforms can be efficiently derived from the non-windowed transforms by convolution.  Name  The function is named in honour of von Hann, who used the three-term weighted average smoothing technique on meteorological data. However, the erroneous \\"Hanning\\" function is also heard of on occasion, derived from the paper in which it was named, where the term \\"hanning a signal\\" was used to mean applying the Hann window to it. The confusion arose from the similar Hamming function, named after Richard Hamming.

The house is a Grade I listed building. It is currently owned and occupied by the Rehau Group.  A Short History  Although Hill Court has only been owned by four families since its construction nearly three hundred years ago, each family has been instrumental in the development of different aspects of this fine country estate from the structure of the building to the lay out of the gardens and the management of the land. In 1698 the building of Hill Court was initiated by Richard Clarke, the son of a country gentleman, whose family, it is believed, made their fortune importing clover seed to England in the seventeenth century. Work on Hill Court progressed, but Richard died in 1702 before his house was finished and the task of completing the building was passed on to his brother Joseph. There were not many surviving accounts from the building but records show that on 21 September 1700 the sum of ¬£71 12s 9d was paid to Robert Wayman for all the brickwork in the house walls and drains. Church of the Paraclete When Joseph Clarke finished building Hill Court in 1708 it was a rectangular, two storey house with a large hipped roof. Looking at the house today it is possible to see the darker bricks of the original building finishing in a line just above the first floor windows of the central block. Joseph lived in his new country house with his wife and eight children and he was sufficiently established in the county to become Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1715. In the 1700s the impressive avenue in the front of the house was planted with elm trees by John Kyrle, a friend of Joseph Clarke. Kyrle was a local gentleman and benefactor to the town of Ross. It is documented that he rebuilt the church spire and laid out the Prospect, a public garden in the town. The stone work at Hill Court bears resemblance to that in the Prospect gardens and this suggests that there may be some truth in the tradition that he designed Hill Court. Joseph Clarke died in 1728 and was succeeded by his eldest son Richard. It is probable, that about eight years later, Richard began extending Hill Court, creating the house as we know it today. Unfortunately he died in 1748 before his alterations were completed. As it turned out the extensions were scarcely needed by Richard's family. His brother John died in 1759; their mother died in 1765 and was succeeded by her daughters, Alice who died in 1779, Mary who died in 1789 and Jane who died in 1806. After Jane's death the Clarke estate was divided and Hill Court was inherited by her second cousin Kingsmill Evans, who, in the early nineteenth century, extended and improved the gardens belonging to the house. As he had no children when he died in 1851, he left the house to his nephew Captain Kingsmill Manley Power the son of Sir Manley Power and Anne Evans. After the death of Captain Kingsmill Manley Power in 1888 Hill Court was bought in 1893 by Major Lionel James Trafford.Lionel Trafford by James Baxendale OBE Major Trafford was succeeded in 1900 by his brother Guy Rawson Trafford who married Miss Dorothy Moffatt, the daughter of Harold Moffat. After the death of her brother in 1916 Dorothy became heiress to Goodrich Court and so the two estates were united creating one estate of nearly two thousand acres, spanning several parishes. Guy Rawson Trafford was Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1919. In 1933 the main gate piers were moved to the position they are in today in front of the house, and details of the sad story connected with them can be found on a brass plate attached to one of the piers. It reads:- \\"These piers, moved from the east end of the avenue were in course of erection and the gates were in the making as a 21st Birthday present to Guy Harold Trafford when he was killed in a motor accident on his way to Queens College Oxford, 8 October 1933.\\" Dorothy's mother, Mrs Harold Moffatt, whose home was Goodrich Court, died in 1938. Upon her mother's death Dorothy left Hill Court and went to live at Goodrich Court. At her invitation Felsted School from Essex was evacuated to Mrs Trafford's three Herefordshire houses for the duration of the Second World War to be out of the way of German bombing. Hill Court was occupied from 1940 to March 1945 by Windsor's and Ingle's Houses of Felsted. When Felsted School left it became clear that it was impossible to maintain two large houses, so Dorothy Trafford moved back to Hill Court. There was no apparent use for Goodrich Court and in 1946 it was pulled down. Dorothy died in 1954 and was succeeded by her son John Lionel Trafford who died unmarried in 1978. After his death the tenant farmers of the 2,000 acre estate were given the opportunity to purchase their farms. As a result of the division of the estate, Hill Court was reduced to its current size of approximately 40ha. In the early 1980s Hill Court was sold to Christopher Rowley who turned part of the estate into a garden centre. In 1994 the property was sold to Rehau Ltd, a private German Industrial GroupCompany history and was completely renovated. In 1997 Rehau acquired the Church of the Paraclete to the east of the house.

Rykwert is the author of many influential works on architecture, including The Idea of a Town (1963), On Adam's House in Paradise (1972), The Dancing Column (1996) and The Seduction of Place (2000). All his books have been translated into several languages. Krakow, 2013alt=  Biography  The son of Elizabeth Melup and Szymon Rykwert, Rykwert was born in Warsaw in 1926 and moved to England in 1939, on the eve of the second World War. Rykwert was educated at Charterhouse and then at the Bartlett School of Architecture (University College, London) and the Architectural Association in London. His first academic posts were lecturing at Hammersmith School of Arts & Crafts and subsequently at the Ulm School of Design from 1958, and then as Librarian and Tutor at the Royal College of Art from 1961 to 1967 where he obtained his PhD He was appointed Professor of Art at the newly created University of Essex, a post he held from 1967 until 1980, when he moved to Cambridge first as Slade Professor of Fine Art and then as Reader in Architecture. Here Rykwert continued his influential master's programme, taught with the architectural critic Dalibor Vesely. In 1988 Rykwert was appointed as the Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1998; he is now Emeritus Professor. Joseph Rykwert has lectured or taught at many major schools of architecture throughout the world and has held visiting appointments at Princeton, the Cooper Union, New York, Harvard Graduate School of Design, the University of Sydney, of Louvain, the Institut d'Urbanisme, Paris, the Central European University and others: in 1998‚Äì99 he was a British Academy visiting professor at the University of Bath. He has held senior fellowships at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts, Washington, and the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. In 1984 Rykwert was appointed Chevalier dans l‚Äôordre des Arts et des Lettres. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh (1995), the University of Cordoba, Argentina (1998), the University of Bath (2000), of Toronto (2005) Rome (20005) and Trieste (2007), and is a member of the Italian Accademia di San Luca and the Polish Academy. In 2000 he was awarded the Bruno Zevi prize in architectural history by the Biennale of Venice, and in 2009 the Gold Medal Bellas Artes, Madrid. He has been president of the international council of architectural critics (CICA) since 1996, and is the recipient of the 2014 Royal Gold Medal.Oliver Wainwright: \\"RIBA awards Royal Gold Medal to architectural historian Joseph Rykwert\\", in The Guardian, 18 September 2013 He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to architecture. In May 2016 he received an honorary degree in pedagogy at the University of Bologna.  Works  Joseph Rykwert's preoccupations are many, but some particular themes stand out. His work is fundamentally concerned with the origin of architectural ideas and, having experienced displacement himself at an early age, with our sense of 'place'. In The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World (first published in 1963 and in two subsequent editions), rather than accept the archaeologists‚Äô viewpoint of the ancient city as an outcome of practical settlement needs, Rykwert broke new ground in understanding the ancient town as a product of sacred and symbolic rituals. The book served as a timely critique of post-war New Town developments. In On Adam‚Äôs House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History (1972 and subsequent editions) Rykwert examined the persistent idea that architecture could be returned to a lost state of accord with nature, an accord symbolised by the fabled idea that Adam had built a house in Eden. In The First Moderns: The Architects of the Eighteenth Century (1980), Rykwert traced the origins of many modern ideas that are commonly assumed to be recent inventions (such as optics and perspective). The book is not a conventional history of style, but rather one of ideas and culture. Frances Yates explained this novelty of approach in The Times Literary Supplement: ‚ÄòThe range of Rykwert's learning is enormous. History of gardens, Chinese influences, festival architecture, all contribute to the overflowing wealth. Great figures in the history of thought and science ‚Äî Bacon, Newton, Vico ‚Äî are seen from new angles....This is no superficial history of styles, no conventional history of ideas. It invigorates both through the attempt at a new kind of history of architecture.‚Äô In The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture (1996) Rykwert turned his attention to the origins of the architectural Orders, and more recently in The Seduction of Place: The History and Future of Cities (2000) to the question of how to make successful urban spaces and forms in cities today. Throughout his career Rykwert has been preoccupied with the work of the Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti. In 1955 Rykwert published an annotated edition of Leoni's 1756 translation of Alberti's treatise, entitled The Ten Books of Architecture, by L.B. Alberti, and this was followed in 1989 with a new translation from Latin, entitled On the Art of Building in Ten Books (published with Robert Tavernor and Neil Leach). In 1994 Rykwert co-curated (with Robert Tavernor and Anne Rykwert) an international exhibition on Alberti's work, held at the Palazzo Te in Mantua. Alberti's overlapping interest in architectural theory and practice, and his conception of the architect as a philosopher and student of many arts, led Rykwert to identify him as representing the model architect for an age where the role of the designer is in danger of being reduced to that of a businessman or technocrat. The conception of architecture as a product of inter-related disciplines and as a sister to other visual arts informs Rykwert's latest book, The Judicious Eye: Architecture Against the Other Arts, published in 2008. Joseph Rykwert married his second wife, Anne, during his time in Essex, and she has been a collaborator on notable works including the international Alberti exhibition and a book on the Adam brothers. Rykwert‚Äôs teaching has influenced several generations of architects and historians. Sir James Stirling commented on The First Moderns, for example, that it was: ‚ÄòAn erudite lead into my favourite period (early nineteenth century) with amazing revelations on the architectural heroes of the time.‚Äô Many of Rykwert‚Äôs former pupils have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, such as Daniel Libeskind, Shams Naga, Eric Parry, Alberto P√©rez-G√≥mez, Mohsen Mostafavi, Robert Tavernor, Vaughan Hart and David Leatherbarrow. Many university departments of architecture in the United Kingdom or America employ members of staff who were taught by Rykwert. Unlike many architectural historians before him, Joseph Rykwert has not been concerned with architectural style or the classical language per se, but rather with the meaning of a particular design that should always find its own appropriate expression. Throughout his work he has been concerned with professional architectural practice as much as with history and theory, and with the ways in which buildings are actually designed and made.

He played wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Cardinals/St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys. Randle played college football at the University of Virginia. Early years Randle attended Fork Union Military Academy during his elementary and high school years. He focused on track and field, competing in different events and clocking 9.8 seconds in the 100-yard dash in 1954, which was a school record that stood until 1982, earning him All-American honors and an invitation to the U.S. Olympic Trials. Randle held the school record in the 400 metres (50.8 seconds) from 1954 until 1960. In the 200 metres, he ranked second in school history until 1955. Randle achieved these records on cinder tracks, instead of the faster modern synthetic tracks. Randle did not play football until his senior year, because his athletic director Gus Lacy (who also served as his guardian) feared he would get hurt. Randle fractured his clavicle in his third game. He also practiced basketball. Randle had the distinction of attending Fork Union Military Academy as a cadet for the longest time (over twelve years). College career VMI offered Randle a scholarship, but he did not adapt and returned home before the end of his first year. He decided to walk-on to the University of Virginia and eventually earned a football scholarship. In Randle's first two seasons, he did not have an impact, because he played as a wingback in the team's run-oriented offense. In 1957, as the offense began changing into more of an open passing attack, he ranked second on the team with 14 receptions for 168 yards. In 1958, Randle finished second in the NCAA with 47 receptions and first in kickoff returns (24.1 ypr). He posted 47 receptions for 642 yards, 1,253 all-purpose yards, 506 kickoff yards and 5 touchdowns. In college, Randle also practiced basketball (one season) and track (four seasons), where he set a record by running the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds. He ran the 220-yard dash in 20.7 seconds. In 1991, Randle was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =Chicago Cardinals= Randle was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the 19th round (218th overall) of the 1958 NFL Draft, with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over. In 1959, although he was one of the fastest players in the league as a rookie, he had trouble adapting to the professional game, registering only 15 receptions, but veteran defensive backs Dick 'Night Train' Lane and Jimmy Hill taught him how to get open. =St. Louis Cardinals= In only his second season in the NFL, Randle had a break-out year registering 62 receptions (second on the league) for 893 yards and 15 touchdowns (led the league) and was named first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP), The Sporting News and UPI. In 1961, his numbers fell with Sam Etcheverry at quarterback, posting 44 receptions for 591 yards and 9 touchdowns. The next year Charley Johnson took over at quarterback and he finished with 63 receptions (second on the league) for 1,158 yards (second on the league), with an 18.4 average per reception and 7 touchdowns. On November 4, 1962, Randle had at the time the second best game statistically by a wide receiver in NFL history as he caught 16 passes for 256 yards in a game against the New York Giants. He finished the season with 63 receptions for 1,158 yards, 8 touchdown catches and was named second-team All-Pro by UPI. Randle once again passed the 1,000-yard receiving mark in 1963, finishing with 51 receptions for 1,014 yards and 12 touchdowns (fourth on the league). In 1964, he suffered a serious shoulder separation and was lost for the season after the seventh game. At the time he was on pace for third straight 1,000-yard season. In 1966, he was limited with a fractured hand and although he didn't miss any games, he only recorded 17 receptions for 218 yards and 2 touchdowns. On September 14, 1967, after drafting wide receiver Dave Williams in the first round, the Cardinals traded him to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a second round draft choice (#42-Bob Atkins). He left the Cardinals as the franchise's second all-time leading wide receiver. In 1988, he was named to the All-time Cardinal Team. =San Francisco 49ers= In 1967, he appeared in 14 games (10 starts), registering 33 receptions for 502 yards and 4 touchdowns. In 1968, he was released after playing in 3 games on October 11. =Dallas Cowboys= On October 16, 1968, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys for depth purposes. He appeared in 6 games as a reserve and had one reception for 12 yards. On July 16, 1969, he was traded to the Washington Redskins. =Washington Redskins= In 1969, he was acquired by the Washington Redskins and was moved to tight end under head coach Vince Lombardi. He was injured in a preseason game and was released on September 16. Randle finished his career with 65 touchdown receptions in 120 games, currently placing him 12th on the NFL's all-time TD-per-game list (minimum 60 TDs). His 65 TD catches were also the most in the NFL during the 1960s; Don Maynard caught 84 and Lance Alworth caught 77 in the American Football League (AFL). Coaching career In 1961, Bing Devine the general manager of baseball's St. Louis Cardinals, asked him to work with his players on improving their running technique, for which future Hall of Famer Lou Brock gave him credit for his success stealing bases. In 1970, he became an assistant coach at East Carolina University and was a part a of the coaching staff during the 17‚Äì14 win against Marshall University, which would later be involved in a plane crash on the way home, that killed 75 people: 37 football players, five coaches, two athletic trainers, the athletic director, 25 boosters, and a plane crew of five. He became the Pirates' head coach in 1971, leading the team to back-to-back Southern Conference championships in 1972 and 1973. He was named the conference's coach of the year in both years. He then spent two years as head coach at his alma mater, the University of Virginia (1974‚Äì1975), two seasons at Massanutten Military Academy (1976‚Äì1977) as head football coach and athletic director, and five seasons at Marshall University (1979‚Äì1983) as the football head coach. In 2009, he was inducted into the East Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame. Broadcasting career In the 1960s, Randle began his broadcasting while still playing for the Cardinals. In the mid-1980s, he was active in sports broadcasting, participating in radio broadcasts of college football games as a color commentator in St. Louis, Virginia and West Virginia. In 1991, Randle started S-R Sports, a syndicated talk radio network based in Virginia. He retired from broadcasting in 2014.

The usual minimum is three incoming lines. If we look at a station with platforms running from left to right, the minimum to qualify as a junction station would usually be one line on the left and two on the right (or vice versa). This is not to be confused with a station where there is one through line, but single track on one side while double track on the other. In this case, all trains passing through the station can reach only one destination as their next station. Commonly, junction stations have multiple platform faces to enable trains for multiple destinations to stand at the station at the same time, but this is not necessary.

Etymology The term comes from the days of sailing ships, when a rigger was a person who worked with rigging, that is, ropes for hoisting the sails. Sailors could put their rope skills to work in lifting and hauling. In an era before mechanical haulage and cranes, ropes, pulleys and muscle power were all that was available to move heavy objects. A specialized subset are telecommunication riggers, entertainment industry riggers. In time, rigging became a trade in itself, giving rise to modern usages with some original terminology remaining, with its roots all but forgotten. Description Riggers attach loads of equipment to cranes or structures using shackles, cables, chains, clamps or straps, employing pulleys, winches, lifts or chain hoists (aka chain motors). Quick load calculations are necessary for each load and engineering principles are always in play. Riggers use various suspension techniques to get their load around obstacles on a construction site or loading dock or event site to the desired location and height.

The L-series (; Linke) trains are temporary trains run by railway bureaus of the People's Republic of China at times when they are thought to be necessary, such as the Chunyun period.  History  = 1940‚Äì1960 = The very first L-series trains appeared during the Anti-Japanese war, when the national railway network was entirely operated by South Manzhou Railway(ÂçóÊª°ÈìÅË∑Ø), and controlled by Japan. After the victory of the war, the country was founded, and the National Railway Bureau(ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÈìÅË∑ØÂ±Ä), which once called China People's Railway(‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÈìÅÈÅì) was founded. Then, to meet the transport needs during the Spring Featival (Chunyun), the bureau started a \\"temporary passenger service\\", which was usually operated using freight wagons as a result of a lack of passenger coaches. = The Cultural Revolution = During the Cultural Revolution, the national railway bureau was taken control from the government, and more trains to meet the needs of revolutionaries to move around the country. More \\"temporary passenger services\\" had to be made, this time with more freight wagons and passenger coaches. It was also a time when there's many serious injuries in those trains, and even deaths. = 1976‚Äì1990 = After the downfall of \\"the gang of four\\", the national railway bureau was controlled by the government again, and more L-series services had to be made to transport the huge flows of people rushing home during the Spring Festival. The flow of east and south coming people looking for jobs made it even worse. The trains were too crowded that passengers even had to push themselves into windows to get on the trains. L-series trains were still operated, but with less and less freight wagons and more commuter coaches (known as coach type 30). = 1990‚Äì2000 = With more and more passenger coaches were made, those services provided by freight wagons finally stopped the L-series services in 2000. Meanwhile, the fourth railway speed-up campaign made more faster services and more L-series trains in a higher speed. The L-series trains began to run as the same priority of 1- or 2- trains instead of the lowest level. = 2000‚Äì2015 = The national railway bureau improved the L-series train services during the 5th and 6th railway speed-up campaign. = 2015‚Äì = In 2015 all the L-series trains were replaced by trains with a temporary number of 3- and 4-, and the new fast and express temporary trains was introduced. The L-series was then divided into K-series (K3*** and K4***), T-series (T3*** and T4***), Z-series (Z3*** and Z4***).

Munjoy Hill is a neighborhood and prominent geographical feature of Portland, Maine. It is located east of downtown and south of East Deering, the neighborhood it is connected to by Tukey's Bridge. The neighborhood historically had a large Irish and Italian American population.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815588,00.html Geography At the northeastern end of Portland's peninsula, Munjoy Hill overlooks the downtown and harbor to the south, Casco Bay and its islands to the east and north, and shallow Back Cove to the west. The Eastern Promenade rings the neighborhood and offers panoramic views of these features, as well as two lighthouses, Mason Station power plant, and the stone battlement of Fort Gorges. Though less than a mile from the heart of downtown Portland and Interstate Highway 295, Munjoy Hill is relatively free of traffic. While densely settled, it is almost exclusively residential and due to the shape of the peninsula it is isolated from the major commuter routes. Congress Street, downtown Portland's main artery, ends quietly at the Eastern Promenade. Washington Avenue, crossing from the other side of Back Cove, might be considered the boundary of the neighborhood, with Fox Street and India Street areas merging into the downtown and Bayside areas. The most significant land feature of Munjoy Hill is Eastern Promenade, a park designed by the Olmsted Brothers design firm, as was Baxter Boulevard, which rings part of Back Cove. This Olmsted park has water vistas wrapping from the sunset view at the Loring memorial above the shore for over a mile to a sunrise view over the Calendar Islands of Casco Bay and Portland Head Light, and ending at Fort Allen Park with a full sweep of Portland Harbor. The park includes a series of broad rolling fields, public gardens, monuments, playgrounds and ball courts on top of the bluff and, along the waterfront, East End Beach, picnic areas, and a municipal boat launch. The Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Co. & Museum operates 2-foot gauge steam and diesel tourist trains along the Casco Bay shore of the peninsula. The shoreway trail, which begins in South Portland, runs next to the railroad line and connects with the Baxter Boulevard trail, all suitable for walking, running, and cycling. The small public beach is a favorite of kayakers, families, and, after 5 PM, dog owners and their pets. The launch is often used to ferry heavy equipment to the city's outlying islands, including Peaks, Little Diamond and Great Diamond Islands. Near the northern end of the Eastern Promenade, a monument to Korean War pilot Charles J. Loring, Jr. offers sunset viewing over Back Cove, plus an occasional glimpse of Mount Washington, about away in New Hampshire's White Mountains. Another park, Fort Sumner Park (also known as Standpipe Park), on North Street, offers views of downtown. The East End Beach is a small beach on the eastern side of Munjoy Hill.Insiders' Guide to Portland, Maine By Sara Donnelly, Meredith Goad Prominent buildings Portland Observatory in c. 1910 At the center of Munjoy Hill, on the crest of the hill (between Kellogg and St Lawrence Streets) are the Portland Observatory, the neighborhood fire station (housing Engine 1, Ladder 1, and Ladder 5) and Hilltop Superette. Nearby on Congress Street are a laundromat, Rosemont Market, Hilltop Coffee, and three restaurants ‚Äì Blue Spoon, The Front Room, and Lolita. Housing in the neighborhood is a mix of single- and multi-family structures. There are many triple-deckers, especially on Vesper, Morning, and North Streets. Many of these are rental units, with some condominiums. Only a small proportion have more than three units. Until recently (March 2006) the neighborhood had two elementary schools, Jack Elementary School and the Marada Adams School. Jack was found to be contaminated with mold, closed and was demolished. Its students were relocated to other city schools pending the construction of a unified East End School to replace both Jack and Adams. The East End School opened to students in September 2006. The local polling place and public library branch services from the Adams school were moved to the East End School as well. The Portland Public Library's Munjoy Hill branch, within the East End school, was closed in 2010. The space now holds the school's own library. There is a small, arts-based, neighborhood preschool, on Lafayette Street, called The Schoolhouse. The St. Lawrence Arts Center is home to Good Theater Productions and other arts events year-round. Education Beginning in 2006, the neighborhood was served by the East End Community School, which was built following the closure of Jack Elementary and Marada Adams schools. Parks Munjoy Hill is home to a number of parks. The Eastern Promenade is one of Portland's most scenic and highly used public spaces. Other parks include Fort Sumner Park (also called Standpipe Park) on North Street. The park is now privately owned, and the origin of the name is unknown. In the 1950s and '60s - perhaps earlier - neighbors referred to it as \\"Shailer Park\\", likely due to its being next door to Shailer School. When publicly owned, it was officially Fort Sumner Park, named for the fort which had been located there. (The area at the end of North Street named erroneously on many maps as Fort Sumner Park is Loring Memorial Park. There was a stand pipe in the area, but it, and a reservoir, was located at the corner of North and Walnut Street where there are now apartments.) =Fort Allen Park= 6\\"/30 caliber gun salvaged from in Fort Allen Park Mainmast and bridge shield of Fort Allen Park, which covers and abuts the Eastern Promenade to the south, was built in the 1890s, designed by the city's Chief Engineer William Goodwin and backed by Mayor James P. Baxter, according to a plaque in the park. Fort Allen was probably originally built in 1775, may have served as part of Fort Sumner, and was rebuilt by the city and used to guard Portland during the War of 1812 due to its high vantage point overlooking Casco Bay.Casco Bay forts at NorthAmericanforts.comFort Allen at FortWiki.com The park is home to a 6-inch gun from the (the ship whose explosion in Havana, Cuba started the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War), the foremast and bridge structure of the World War II cruiser , two Civil War-era 4.5-inch siege rifles, an American Civil War memorial bench erected in 1929, and an historic bandstand which was built in the 1890s. In 2012, a local non-profit group, Friends of the Eastern Promenade, sought to restore Fort Allen Park to its original look. As of 2016 this has resulted in additional interpretive plaques throughout the park, along with other improvements. Some sources state that Fort Allen dates from 1775 and was originally named for Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen. It was initially a half-moon battery mounting five guns.Roberts, pp. 357, 373Fort Allen at FortWiki.com After 1794 it may have served as the \\"detached battery\\" of nearby Fort Sumner, as described in the Secretary of War's report for 1811.Wade, p. 241 Fort Allen was rebuilt in 1814 with city resources, adding a magazine and barracks due to the British capture of Eastport and Castine in the War of 1812.Portland forts at NorthAmericanForts.com A plaque at the park states that at this time it was named for Master Commandant William Henry Allen, a naval officer mortally wounded in the War of 1812.

It is situated in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and within the historical region of Warmia.  History  Gothic Saint John the Baptist church Wormditt, a village of Old Prussians, was first mentioned in 1308. The town coat of arms depicts the worm (English: worm, dragon), German: Worms, Wurm as in Tatzelwurm, Lindworm). The bishop of Warmia Eberhard von Nei√üe ordered the building of a city which received town rights in 1313 and was mainly populated by settlers from Silesia. Until 1772 Orneta was part of Poland. In 1538 Orneta was visited by astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who accompanied the newly elected Warmian bishop, Polish diplomat Jan Dantyszek during his tour of Warmia. The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland, and subsequently it became part of Germany in 1871. The Germans established three prisoner of war forced labour camps in the town. After World War II the town again became part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. In May 2010, a procession with the coffin of Nicolaus Copernicus stopped in Orneta and official ceremonies took place before the great astronomer was buried again in Frombork. Legend of the dragon According to some legend, many ages ago there lived a dragon that devoured not only animals, but also women and children. Many knights who tried to set the town free from the disaster were killed in a struggle with the monster. At last one of the knights managed to combat the dragon. Reminiscences of the legend are reflected in Orneta's crest. The oldest image of the crest is known from the sealing wax on the document from 1388. It represents the dragon biting its own tail. In the frame of the seal there is only a fragment of an inscription which says\\" S.BV.MDIT.\\" However, on the seals from the 15th century, a juridical seal from the 16th century as well as the seal of the town secretary from 18th century there is the dragon coiled, lying on its own back.

Vesely was one of the most outstanding architectural teachers of the late twentieth century. As well as inspiring generations of students, he taught some of the current leading architects and architectural historians, such as Daniel Libeskind, Eric Parry, Alberto P√©rez-G√≥mez, Mohsen Mostafavi and David Leatherbarrow. He began teaching at the University of Essex, before moving to the Architectural Association in London and in 1978 to the University of Cambridge Department of Architecture, where he also started an M.Phil. programme in History and Philosophy of Architecture with Peter Carl. Together with Peter Carl, his teaching and theoretical approach became associated and dominated the Cambridge Architecture School in the 1980s and early 1990s. After retiring from his full-time post in Cambridge, Vesely continued to teach there, remaining Director of Studies at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and he also taught Architectural History and Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, and was an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the Manchester School of Architecture. In 2005 he was recipient of the CICA Bruno Zevi Book Award granted by the International Committee of Architectural Critics for his book \\"Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation\\". In 2006 the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) honoured Dalibor Vesely with the Annie Spink Award for Excellence in Architectural Education and in 2015 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the RIBA in recognition of both his lifetime contributions to architectural theory and to teaching.  Biography  Vesely was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1934. He studied engineering, architecture, art history and philosophy in Prague, Munich, Paris and Heidelberg and obtained his PhD from Charles University in Prague. This was supervised by Josef Havlicek, Karel Honzik, and Jaroslav Fragner. He studied with Hans-Georg Gadamer, with whom he kept a correspondence until Gadamer's death. He stated it was the philosopher of phenomenology Jan Patoƒçka who, in his own words, \\"contributed more than anyone else to [his] overall intellectual orientation and to the articulation of some of the critical topics\\" it was under the influence of Gadamer and Patoƒçka that he developed the lifelong interest in the poetics and hermeneutics of architecture that defined his teaching and research. Vesely was in England with his brother in 1968 when the Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia. He stayed in London, first teaching at the Architectural Association, taking charge of the 'Unit 1' studio and then moving to the University of Essex where he and Joseph Rykwert established a master's degree in architectural history. He was invited to Cambridge by Colin St John Wilson in 1978. There he, Rykwert and Peter Carl initiated MPhil and PhD courses in the history and philosophy of architecture, thereby bringing the emerging studio culture which had been cultivated at the AA which came to define the school in the 1980s and 1990s.  Architecture and hermeneutics  Vesely's work may be understood primarily as a contribution to cultural hermeneutics, and his exploration of the historical background of modern science in the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries is particularly rich in detail and insight onto the changing nature of representation. Vesely polemises on concepts such as perspective and anamorphosis, which are traditionally understood to have taken departure from Renaissance culture. Vesely contributes to the current debate with the depth of the problem of representation; a question which has divided Western philosophy with regard to the epistemological possibility of representation and understanding of natural phenomena. The 'birth' of modern science and its increasing challenge on traditional views has also marked the divide within the possibilities of representation. In the context of the seventeenth century, this was especially clear as a polemics surrounding the nature of scientific work and philosophical understanding. According to Vesely, the inevitable partiality of such views is at the very core of the problem that affects the cultural understanding of representation. Its contingent nature was not always understood as a divide originating all kinds of dualisms. Before modern science, representation was naturally contingent and the universal aspirations of science (metaphysics) were bound to the nature of the epistemological ground (arch√©). Vesely's work traces back the ontological foundations of the problem to the Greek context, helping to clarify its original meaning. In Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation (2004), Vesely presents the notion of ground as having a provisional nature, that can only be seized as a continuity of reference through different levels of representation, ranging from the more explicit, visible world down to a latent world of potential articulation. Precisely this continuity is what may allow us to address the modern, fragmented notion of representation as a task of rehabilitation, which would trace the fragment back to its original whole.  Architecture and representation  Vesely's written work was mostly in articles in journals and many of the arguments developed over the years in lectures and seminars. There is thus no comprehensive overview of his thought or his range of interests. However Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation (2004), provides a summary of his thinking and this work remains the main source for understanding his approach. Many of his other ideas which were expressed in lectures and seminars remain unpublished. =Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation= In Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation (2004), Vesely sets the argument from the experience of architecture, as it constantly works through different modes of representation, including \\"built reality\\". In it, Vesely defines the present cultural situation as divided and ambiguous, especially when it comes to architecture (pp. 4‚Äì12, 36, 44 ss). Twentieth-century architecture, he argues, places its trust in the epistemological model of modern science and technology that is today largely reflected in instrumental concepts of city and suburban landscape. Today, he states, the attempt to rehabilitate the primary tradition of architecture faces the problem of bridging the gap between different modes of representation and concepts of knowledge that in some cases precede modern science, i.e., precede the historical notion of scientific knowledge as it takes course from the seventeenth- and sixteenth centuries. Vesely's research delved into these historical settings that are understood to be the birthplace of modern science, in the general hope of exposing the origin of our modern notion of knowledge and how it came about to emancipate from traditional representations of the world. Vesely's research was accordingly a working out the historical notion of representation, as it constituted a central issue in this historical affair; and how the construction of a modern notion of knowledge had much to do with a changing nature in the concept of representation (pp. 13‚Äì19). The concept as it is generally understood today largely surpasses the history of epistemology. According to Vesely, this is because representation is generally understood on the basis of a certain \\"continuity between a particular mode of representation and what is represented\\" (p. 14), a notion which has been current throughout the whole of European architectural history. = The modern situation= When looking at the modern situation, Vesely finds that the problem is generally structured on the basis of an ontological difference that is intrinsic to representation itself. This is precisely the difference that allows modes of representation to emancipate from that which is represented, and from particular, given circumstances (pp. 4‚Äì5). The discussion of ontological difference therefore constitutes an epistemological difference affecting the conditions and possibilities of knowledge. And speculative thought, which we so associate with modern science, is built on this difference. Charles Taylor (1995) points out how the question for modern science is to fit a particular mode of representation to another, extrinsic representation: what we commonly call the \\"outer reality\\". The difference between the two constantly jeopardizes their epistemological value; and affects not only the way in which representation relates to what it means to represent, but also between different modes of representing it. In response, Vesely's work explores how architecture constantly works between different modes of representation, through the difference between project and what is built, for instance, when it translates a whole city into a diagram, a plan or a map. The simple act of reading a map involves more than just the imagination to relate the map with the buildings and the surrounding space; it involves the reciprocity between different levels of representation, that may intake discrepancy and lack of information. According to Vesely, this kind of discrepancy might be useful to understand the nature of the question; and may in fact become a means to understand what impairs the communication between different levels of representation, and conversely, what happens when such communication takes place. Vesely also takes up the example of an experiment that, paradoxically perhaps, was carried out in the hey-day of logical empiricism. The experiment was carried out by Schilder, and involved a temporary inversion of the visual field (pp. 46ss), leaving other perceptual fields untouched. Schilder's experiment addressed the discontinuity between the visual and other fields of perception, and exposed the situated human body as a basic structure of spatial reference (pp. 48‚Äì49). Vesely investigates how the subjects of the experiment found that their bodies were the first instance they could rely on when trying to situate in a visual world that was not only upside down, but also turned from left to right; and when trying to perform simple gestures like picking up a book, or reading. Although the experience was difficult to endure, the inverted vision could be partially reconciled with the original body structure (p. 47). According to Vesely, the ability to reconcile the acquired inverted vision with the situational structure of the human body, points out to a deeper problem when dealing with situation, which is related to our ability to become situated on provisional grounds, even when lacking a fundamental 'ground' of spatial or temporal reference. The example from inverted vision also means to show that such a basis is far from being immediate; it is constituted in the process of a search within the actual space and comes about in the reciprocity between different levels and forms of representation such as visual, tactile, and so forth. Vesely elaborates on situation and the phenomenon of being situated as an example of how we contextualize spatial knowledge and on which basis; and on how a particular point of reference allows us to situate spatial knowledge. In the course of the argument, Vesely demonstrates that what constitutes the fabric of situation is a continuity of reference and experience through different forms of articulating spatiality down to an implicit structure that itself is neither visual nor tactile, and is only potentially articulated in the objective realm (pp. 48, 82‚Äì87, 378ss). = Situation and perception = Vesely's argument on the epistemological process of being situated develops in terms of an analogy to the formation of the visual field. And takes the organic ability of sight only as a point of departure to the phenomenon of vision, i.e. what one is able to recognize and know out of visual perception. Accordingly, the natural process of seeing is shown to be a result from learning. Vesely presents the example of inborn conditions of blindness treated through surgery, where sight itself only emerges after a painful stage of learning, and without which, the recently acquired sense of sight would be unable to detach or recognize individual objects out of a 'visual field' (pp. 50‚Äì51). Vesely describes how the integration of the newly acquired sense relies on the fact that the world of the blind is already structured, not only in terms of temporal sequences, but spatially; and that the reconciliation of the new ability of sight takes place on an already structured ground of existing objects and spatiality. Perception such as visual or tactile is reconciled upon an implicitly structured ground. Vesely shows how the task of bridging different plateaux of representation can only be fulfilled by covering the distance to a common 'ground' (pp. 61‚Äì63). 'Ground' is like a point of departure from which it would become possible to uncover the basic structure of spatiality; but it is hardly the case that such an epistemological ground can provide us with an absolute source of spatial reference. The notion of epistemological ground is not established a priori, as a given point of reference. It comes about in the process of searching, taking place as a continuum of references between different levels of spatial understanding. In which case, what constitutes the structural source of situation is this stream of references (p. 60). Vesely's notion of ground consists of a primary source of reference that in many ways coincides with the traditional Greek understanding of arch√©. Arch√© is not an absolute source of reference, but only a primary one that works as a point of departure towards our notion of \\"earth\\" and our understanding of \\"world\\" (pp. 50‚Äì52). This is an insecure ground that in a sense, speaks more of its own topography, than of clearly defined rules and references. Although this is an unfamiliar ground for modern science, Vesely accurately describes how much of the understanding of what it means to be situated derives from the knowledge of daily situations on Earth, where horizon and gravity play a common role. Accordingly, architecture's task of raising and 'building' situations does not address the mere existence of conditions such as floor or gravity, but concerns the fundamental condition of 'ground' allowing the phenomenon of situation to take place. = Situation and knowledge = On the epistemological level, this means that for Vesely, the nature of 'ground' allows an understanding of 'spatial structure'; like a hermeneutical key granting access to phenomena of spatiality. Contemporary architecture has been particularly keen on challenging the average views on ground viz. gravity. Although most architecture cannot escape the 'predicament' of gravity, there are numerous examples of play with gravity and the 'visual weight' of architectural mass against gravity, starting from the early twentieth-century constructivism. Such architectural play shows an impulse towards the emancipation from gravity as a natural source of situation, and looks forward to expose a more fundamental ground of reference and its problematic nature. Architecture is thus setting a clear challenge on everyday experience as they are structured characteristically in terms of up and down, and according to a horizontal ground. The experiment of the 'inverted vision' seems to show exactly that: the touch of ground helps to define the vertical and the relative distances of objects, orientation, and to recognize the physiognomy of the space. Outside these conditions it seems more or less obvious that the 'grounds' for situation escape our grasp. At the same time, architects are conscious that it is precisely the implicit nature of ground as a structure of references that makes the task of its architectural exploration so difficult. Moreover, according to Vesely, the notion of 'ground' can never provide us with an absolute knowledge of the whole, but only with a mediated understanding of spatial structure. This means that the task of uncovering the hidden nature of ground becomes, a fortiori, one of looking for a provisional ground that is beyond gravity as a natural source of spatial reference. The first long-term programme dealing with the consequences of the absence of gravity was developed already in 1973 by the NASA Skylab. Vesely reports how one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the astronauts is the constant loss of orientation that becomes a general difficulty in recognizing previously known situations. Without gravity, an otherwise familiar compartment would be unrecognizable if not seen from a particular angle. The Sky Lab experience seems to illustrate quite well how the phenomenon of spatial structure and situation comes to be known through a sequence of approximations. Without the right orientation, simple recognition such as finding objects in their right places would become an almost impossible task. Once found the right orientation towards objects, however, the entire spatial frame of the compartment was recognized and so would all objects in their right places and relative positions. In a situation without light or gravity, one of the Sky Lab astronauts also described how a single touch on one of the walls of the space compartment would be sufficient to enact the knowledge of the relative position of the body with respect to all objects (pp. 52‚Äì54). This seems to be particularly relevant to show how a particular point of visual or tactile reference can provide with orientation; a physiognomic recognition of the space; and be related to the spatial disposition of the whole. These are instances that, according to Vesely, constitute a continuity of spatial reference and an epistemological, provisional ground. As it arises in the continuity of understanding the potential structure of the space, the notion of ground seems to be of a projective nature (p. 103). = The continuity of reference = Vesely seems to confer a projective ability on spatiality that is thus knowable from its own potential to generate a situation. According to Vesely, the continuity of reference to ground exists within a permanent tension with the actual space, a continuity which under certain conditions may be disrupted and even destroyed (pp. 55‚Äì56). The fact that there are discrepancies between different levels of representation should perhaps be no surprise as it is the case of the above-mentioned examples of reading a map, or orienting oneself in a space under zero gravity. That there is discrepancy between the given representation of a space and the actual space is in fact a common datum of everyday experience. The question is not to be solved, although it may constitute one important point of departure to understand the phenomenon of representation. This is particularly the case of extreme conditions where the phenomenon of 'continuity' is no longer recognizable. In the cases of aphasia and apraxia, which rank among others of what is generally known as mental blindness, there is a blatant discontinuity between the possibilities of notional understanding and the actual performance of a purposive act or standard articulation of speech. The work and research that has been carried out on mental blindness tends to show that the ability to articulate both speech and purposive actions and gestures is nonetheless affected by the surrounding environment, and is not based upon mental impairment alone. On the contrary, it has become increasingly clear that such conditions do not take place solely as a result of mental functions; neither can they be enacted by the situational structure, as both contribute to the failure and success of treatment (p. 57). Vesely brings the argument about these conditions back to the experiments regarding orientation, such as the inverted vision experiment and orientation under zero gravity conditions, and correlates it with the problems experienced with mental blindness. This is because of the fundamental knowledge of spatiality that is at stake that enables a possible representation to be actually effected. As regards spatiality, Vesely presupposes an existing continuity between the possible and the actual spatial configuration, as a mediated structure (p. 58). This understanding of representation seems to reverberate Husserl's phenomenological treatment of representation, as moving from the horizon of vague, informal representation (Vorstellung), through a number of possibilities (Vergegenw√§rtigungen), until it finally reaches actuality (Repr√§sentation). The fact that Husserl only used the word Repr√§sentation to deal with explicit forms of representation, may serve us as an example of how a whole representational process was being kept in the background. Husserl's process of representation shows that our knowledge of spatiality intakes different levels of articulation, which are not always as clearly defined as we would wish. This means that the ground and point of departure of explicit references is not a point of departure towards a growing, cumulative knowledge of situation, but is rather a 'coming back' into a prereflective world of experience. In this sense, representation takes place as a spectrum ranging out of explicit forms of articulation into an implicit background, a concept that seems to be confirmed by later phenomenology of perception. It seems obvious that, because of the nature of this prereflective ground, verbal or visual articulation of it cannot take place in an explicit sense. On the contrary, the phenomenological gaze at this background takes place indirectly (p. 69) as a preunderstanding of the world. If this is so, then not only our epistemological ground is constituted as an identity of interpretation of different levels of perception, but also the concept of representation as such is constituted as a movement out of a prereflective background. This is precisely the background against which it becomes possible for an articulated structure to take place and be identified as such (pp. 75‚Äì77). This also means that the difference between different levels of articulation, namely between a preunderstanding background and a given object is precisely what allows us to see the object and situate it within our world of experience. If we accept Vesely's argument, then the difference that formerly stood as an epistemological barrier now becomes a necessary condition for representation to take place. = The latent world of architecture = Vesely addresses the preunderstanding of world as a latent world (p. 83), that is potentially articulated and structured, and whose relationship to its visible manifestation is not immediate. The reciprocity between this prearticulated level and its visible articulation dwells within the very ontological difference that has been discussed previously. Such reciprocity is a schematic constituent of phenomena of continuity and metaphoricity, that have been constantly described throughout the primary tradition of Christian humanism in the nature of being and becoming. Vesely thus enters the core of the question of representation in terms of its coming into the level of visibility. In the sequence of Vesely's argument, the subject of visibility becomes then, of itself, problematic in nature as it intakes a background of potential articulation. According to Vesely, \\"the horizon of visibility displays a synthesis of the prereflective experience and of the achievements of reflection insofar as they preserve ontological continuity with the visible\\" (p. 85). On the other hand, the rise onto the explicit level of visibility primarily seems to express the problem of representation in terms of what is kept from the prereflective world. This could perhaps be seen as a consequence of the traditional concept of inner representation as relating to an external reality. Vesely challenges this concept of representation, and widens it as a spectrum that ranges from the explicitness of our world down to implicit levels of articulation. Consequently, the term reality is restricted mostly to certain types of representation (e.g. virtual reality) that view reality as something extrinsic (pp. 308‚Äì315). Vesely's concept of representation, however, takes place in terms of a communication between a wide range of levels; whereby the question that concerns representation also concerns the truth of representation, a question that has been amply developed by modern hermeneutics. In this domain, the visible world conveys a kind of knowledge of the prereflective levels of articulation that also jeopardizes the epistemological status of the visible. As we have seen, contrary to empiricist belief, the visible world by itself does not constitute an epistemological ground (pp. 84‚Äì86). Instead, our epistemological ground is constituted by features such as orientation, physiognomy, and the relative position of things with regard to one another; and it is from these features that a provisional ground comes to be constituted as regards spatiality. This ground is not a still point of reference. On the contrary, by ground is here meant a source and stream of references. This means that the explicit horizon of the visible, tangible world is the most explicit form of embodiment we have, but such a narrow horizon we can only take as a point of departure if we want to understand the rest of our world that is largely beyond visibility. This also means that the visible holds a very important part as a symbolic representation of our world, enabling us to see and imagine beyond the visible. Finally, this means that we construe our knowledge of 'world' largely on the basis of invisible, implicit references which are only symbolically re- enacted by the visible realm. The level of visual representation may perhaps be compared to the level of more explicit verbal articulation as regards the implicit, preverbal domain of knowledge. Just as visual representation, verbal articulation has the power to emancipate from the given world, and the freedom to convey any meaning. This is a power bestowed upon representation, allowing it to withdraw from its original symbolic domain, thus establishing a tension between the instrumental nature of representation and its larger symbolic field.

Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism. The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82¬∞17‚Ä≤S. As a trailbreaker for later ventures, the Discovery Expedition was a landmark in British Antarctic exploration history.  Background to the expedition  = Forerunners = Between 1839 and 1843 Royal Naval Captain James Clark Ross, commanding his two ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, completed three voyages to the Antarctic continent. During this time he discovered and explored a new sector of the Antarctic that would provide the field of work for many later British expeditions. Sir James Clark Ross, discoverer of the Ross Sea, the Ross Ice Shelf and McMurdo Sound Ross established the general geography of this region, and named many of its features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, but was unable to do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at 78¬∞10‚Ä≤, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay to the east of the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this. After Ross there were no recorded voyages into this sector of the Antarctic for fifty years. Then, in January 1895, a Norwegian whaling trip made a brief landing at Cape Adare, the northernmost tip of Victoria Land. Four years later Carsten Borchgrevink, who had participated in that landing, took his own expedition to the region, in the Southern Cross. This expedition was financed by a donation of ¬£35,000 from British publishing magnate Sir George Newnes, on condition that the venture be called the \\"British Antarctic Expedition\\". Borchgrevink landed at Cape Adare in February 1899, erected a small hut, and spent the 1899 winter there. The following summer he sailed south, landing at Ross's inlet on the Barrier. A party of three then sledged southward on the Barrier surface, and reached a new Furthest South at 78¬∞50‚Ä≤. The Discovery Expedition was planned during a surge of international interest in the Antarctic regions at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. A German expedition under Erich von Drygalski was leaving at about the same time as Discovery, to explore the sector of the continent south of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish explorer Otto Nordenski√∂ld was leading an expedition to Graham Land, and a French expedition under Jean- Baptiste Charcot was going to the Antarctic Peninsula. Finally, the Scottish scientist William Speirs Bruce was leading a scientific expedition to the Weddell Sea. = Royal Navy, Markham and Scott = Under the influence of John Barrow, Second Secretary to the Admiralty, polar exploration had become the province of the peacetime Royal Navy after the Napoleonic War. Naval interest diminished after the disappearance in 1845 of the Franklin expedition, and the many fruitless searches that followed. After the problems encountered by the 1874‚Äì76 North Pole expedition led by George Nares, and Nares's own declaration that the North Pole was \\"impracticable\\", the Admiralty decided that further polar quests would be dangerous, expensive and futile. Captain Robert Falcon Scott, appointed leader of the Discovery Expedition However, the Royal Geographical Society's Secretary (and later President) Sir Clements Markham was a former naval man who had served on one of the Franklin relief expeditions in 1851. He had accompanied Nares for part of the 1874‚Äì76 expedition, and remained a firm advocate for the navy's resuming its historic role in polar exploration. An opportunity to further this ambition arose in November 1893, when the prominent biologist Sir John Murray, who had visited Antarctic waters as a biologist with the Challenger Expedition in the 1870s, addressed the RGS. Murray presented a paper entitled \\"The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration\\", and called for a full-scale expedition for the benefit of British science. This was strongly supported, both by Markham and by the country's premier scientific body, the Royal Society. A joint committee of the two Societies was established to decide the form which the expedition should take. Markham's vision of a full-blown naval affair after the style of Ross or Franklin was opposed by sections of the joint committee, but his tenacity was such that the expedition was eventually moulded largely to his wishes. His cousin and biographer later wrote that the expedition was \\"the creation of his brain, the product of his persistent energy\\". It had long been Markham's practice to take note of promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott had long been in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander. = Science versus adventure = The command structure of the expedition had still to be settled. Markham had been determined from the beginning that its overall leader should be a naval officer, not a scientist. Scott, writing to Markham after his appointment, reiterated that he \\"must have complete command of the ship and landing parties\\", and insisted on being consulted over all future appointments. However, the Joint Committee had, with Markham's acquiescence, secured the appointment of John Walter Gregory, Professor of Geology at the University of Melbourne and former assistant geologist at the British Museum, as the expedition's scientific director. Gregory's view, endorsed by the Royal Society faction of the Joint Committee, was that the organisation and command of the land party should be in his hands: \\"...The Captain would be instructed to give such assistance as required in dredging, tow-netting etc., to place boats where required at the disposal of the scientific staff.\\" In the dispute that followed, Markham argued that Scott's command of the whole expedition must be total and unambiguous, and Scott himself was insistent on this to the point of resignation. Markham's and Scott's view prevailed, and Gregory resigned, saying that the scientific work should not be \\"subordinated to naval adventure\\". This controversy soured relations between the Societies, which lingered after the conclusion of the expedition and was reflected in criticism of the extent and quality of some of the published results. Markham claimed that his insistence on a naval command was primarily a matter of tradition and style, rather than indicating disrespect for science. He had made clear his belief that, on its own, the mere attainment of higher latitude than someone else was \\"unworthy of support.\\"  Personnel  Ernest Shackleton, Third Officer on the Discovery Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894‚Äì97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act. The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \\"might be made into a man.\\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition. He, like Armitage, had been with the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth expedition. The junior doctor and zoologist was Edward Wilson, who became close to Scott and provided the qualities of calmness, patience and detachment that the captain reportedly lacked.  Organisation and objectives  Royal Doulton bone china plate from the expedition, marked \\"\\"DISCOVERY\\" ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION 1901\\" around a penguin. Brought back by C Reginald Ford. = Finance = The total cost of the expedition was estimated at ¬£90,000 (2009 equivalent about ¬£7.25 million), of which ¬£45,000 was offered by the British Government provided that the two Societies could raise a matching sum. They achieved this, thanks largely to a donation of ¬£25,000 from wealthy RGS member Llewellyn W. Longstaff. The RGS itself contributed ¬£8,000, its largest single contribution to any expedition to that date, and ¬£5,000 came from Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe, who had earlier financed the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth expedition to the Arctic, 1894‚Äì97. The rest was raised from smaller donations. The expedition also benefited from significant commercial sponsorship: Colman's provided mustard and flour, Cadbury's gave 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) of chocolate, Bird's donated baking and custard powders, Evans, Lescher & Webb provided all the lime juice. Jaeger gave a 40% discount on special clothing, Bovril supplied beef extract, and others made significant contributions. = Ship = The ship's bell of S.S. Discovery The expedition's ship was built by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company as a specialist research vessel designed for work in Antarctic waters, and was one of the last three- masted wooden sailing ships built in Britain. The construction cost was ¬£34,050 (2009 = ¬£2.7 million), plus ¬£10,322 (¬£830,000) for the engines, and the final cost after all modifications was ¬£51,000 (¬£4.1 m). The name had historic naval associations, most recently as one of the ships used in the Nares expedition, and certain features of this older vessel were incorporated into the design of the new ship. She was launched by Lady Markham on 21 March 1901 as S.Y. Discovery (the Royal Research Ship designation was acquired in the 1920s). As she was not a Royal Naval vessel the Admiralty would not allow Discovery to fly the White Ensign. She eventually sailed under the Merchant Shipping Act, flying the RGS house flag and the Blue Ensign and burgee of the Royal Harwich Yacht Club. = Dogs = Scott contacted Fridtjof Nansen in Oslo, whom he trusted more than his own \\"quarrelling\\" committee in London, and followed his advice on equipment.Scott, cited from Huntford p138: \\"Whilst I have been trying to carry out the equipment on the precepts you [Nansen] taught me in Norway, a committee of 32 scientific men have been quarrelling as to where the expedition is to go!\\" Subsequently, Armitage ordered 25 Siberian sledge-dogs via a Scots dog and ski expert based in Archangel, Russia. According to Huntford however, this expert was not invited to join the expedition. = Objectives = The Discovery Expedition, like those of Ross and Borchgrevink before it, was to work in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica. Other areas of the continent had been considered, but the principle followed was that \\"in going for the unknown they should start from the known\\". The two main objectives of the expedition were summarised in the joint committee's \\"Instructions to the Commander\\" as: \\"to determine, as far as possible, the nature, condition and extent of that portion of the south polar lands which is included in the scope of your expedition\\", and \\"to make a magnetic survey in the southern regions to the south of the fortieth parallel and to carry out meteorological, oceanographic, geological, biological and physical investigations and researches\\". The instructions stipulated that \\"neither of these objectives was to be sacrificed to the other\\". The instructions concerning the geographical objective became more specific: \\"The chief points of geographical interest are [...] to explore the ice barrier of Sir James Ross to its eastern extremity; to discover the land which was believed by Ross to flank the barrier to the eastward, or to ascertain that it does not exist [...] If you should decide to winter in the ice...your efforts as regards geographical exploration should be directed to [...] an advance to the western mountains, an advance to the south, and an exploration of the volcanic region\\".  Expedition  = First years =  Outward journey  Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, and arrived in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40¬∞S for a magnetic survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour was used as the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, fell to his death from the top of the mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later. Discovery then sailed south, arriving at Cape Adare on 9 January 1902. After a brief landing and examination of the remains of Borchgrevink's camp, the ship continued southwards along the Victoria Land coast. At McMurdo Sound Discovery turned eastward, touching land again at Cape Crozier where a pre-arranged message point was set up so that relief ships would be able to locate the expedition. She then followed the Barrier to its eastern extremity where, on 30 January, the land predicted by Ross was confirmed, and named King Edward VII Land. On 4 February, Scott landed on the Barrier and unpacked an observation balloon which he had acquired for aerial surveys. Scott climbed aboard and rapidly ascended to above 600 feet (180 m) in the firmly tethered balloon. Shackleton followed with a second flight. All either could see was unending Barrier surface. Wilson privately thought the flights \\"perfect madness\\". (diary entry, 4 February 1902).  Winter Quarters Bay  General view of the huts Discovery then proceeded westward in search of permanent quarters. On 8 February she entered McMurdo Sound and later that day anchored in a spot near its southern limit which was afterwards christened Winter Quarters Bay. Wilson wrote: \\"We all realized our extreme good fortune in being led to such a winter quarter as this, safe for the ship, with perfect shelter from all ice pressure.\\" (diary entry, 8 February 1902). Stoker Lashly, however, thought it looked \\"a dreary place.\\" Work began ashore with the erection of the expedition's huts on a rocky peninsula designated Hut Point. Scott had decided that the expedition should continue to live and work aboard ship, and he allowed Discovery to be frozen into the sea ice, leaving the main hut to be used as a storeroom and shelter. Of the entire party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any experience with dog-sledges. The results of the men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid over the edge of a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory. During the winter months of May‚ÄìAugust the scientists were busy in their laboratories, while elsewhere equipment and stores were prepared for the next season's work. For relaxation there were amateur theatricals, and educational activities in the form of lectures. A newspaper, the South Polar Times, was edited by Shackleton. Outside pursuits did not cease altogether; there was football on the ice, and the schedule of magnetic and meteorological observations was maintained. As winter ended, trial sledge runs resumed, to test equipment and rations in advance of the planned southern journey which Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were to undertake. Meanwhile, a party under Royds travelled to Cape Crozier to leave a message at the post there, and discovered an emperor penguin colony. Another group, under Armitage, reconnoitred in the mountains to the west, returning in October with the expedition's first symptoms of scurvy. Armitage later blamed the outbreak on Scott's \\"sentimental objection\\" to the slaughter of animals for fresh meat. The entire expedition's diet was quickly revised, and the trouble was thereafter contained.  Southern journey  Shackleton, Scott and Wilson on 3 February 1903, on their return from the attempt to reach the South Pole A modern photograph of the Discovery's old anchorage in Winter Quarters Bay, McMurdo Sound, alongside the Hut Point hut in the right background Scott, Wilson and Shackleton left on 2 November 1902 with dogs and supporting parties. Their goal was \\"to get as far south in a straight line on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land\\". (diary entry, 12 June 1902). The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78¬∞50‚Ä≤. (diary entry, 11 November 1902). However, the lack of skill with dogs was soon evident, and progress was slow. After the support parties had returned, on 15 November, Scott's group began relaying their loads (taking half loads forward, then returning for the other half), thus travelling three miles for every mile of southward progress. Mistakes had been made with the dogs' food, and as the dogs grew weaker, Wilson was forced to kill the weakest as food for the others. The men, too, were struggling, afflicted by snow blindness, frostbite and symptoms of early scurvy, but they continued southwards in line with the mountains to the west. Christmas Day was celebrated with double rations, and a Christmas pudding that Shackleton had kept for the occasion, hidden with his socks. On 30 December 1902, without having left the Barrier, they reached their Furthest South at 82¬∞17‚Ä≤S. Troubles multiplied on the home journey, as the remaining dogs died and Shackleton collapsed with scurvy. Wilson's diary entry for 14 January 1903 acknowledged that \\"we all have slight, though definite symptoms of scurvy\\". Scott and Wilson struggled on, with Shackleton, who was unable to pull, walking alongside and occasionally carried on the sledge. The party eventually reached the ship on 3 February 1903 after covering including relays, in 93 days' travel at a daily average of just over . = Arrival of relief ship = During the southern party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh supplies. The expedition's organisers had assumed that the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to Britain via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period. This plan was frustrated, as Discovery remained firmly icebound. Markham had privately anticipated this, and Morning's captain, William Colbeck, was carrying a secret letter to Scott authorising another year in the ice. This now being inevitable, the relief ship provided an opportunity for some of the party to return home. Among these, against his will, was the convalescent Shackleton, who Scott decided \\"ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health\\". Stories of a Scott-Shackleton rift date from this point, or from a supposed falling- out during the southern journey which had provoked an angry exchange of words. Some of these details were supplied by Armitage, whose relationship with Scott had broken down and who, after Scott, Wilson and Shackleton were all dead, chose to reveal details which tended to show Scott in a poor light. Other evidence indicates that Scott and Shackleton remained on generally good terms for some while; Shackleton met the expedition on its return home in 1904, and later wrote a very cordial letter to Scott. = Second year = After the 1903 winter had passed, Scott prepared for the second main journey of the expedition: an ascent of the western mountains and exploration of the interior of Victoria Land. Armitage's reconnaissance party of the previous year had pioneered a route up to altitude before returning, but Scott wished to march west from this point, if possible to the location of the South Magnetic Pole. After a false start due to faulty sledges, a party including Scott, Lashly and Edgar Evans set out from Discovery on 26 October 1903. Emperor penguins. The colony at Cape Crozier had been discovered by a party led by Charles Royds, in October 1902. Drawing of two emperor penguins with chicks by Wilson (Sept. 1903) Ascending the Ferrar Glacier, which they named after the party's geologist, they reached a height of before being held in camp for a week by blizzards. This prevented them from reaching the glacier summit until 13 November. They then marched on beyond Armitage's furthest point, discovered the Polar Plateau and became the first party to travel on it. After the return of geological and supporting parties, Scott, Evans and Lashly continued westward across the featureless plain for another eight days, covering a distance of about 150 miles to reach their most westerly point on 30 November. Having lost their navigational tables in a gale during the glacier ascent, they did not know exactly where they were, and had no landmarks to help them fix a position. The return journey to the Ferrar Glacier was undertaken in conditions which limited them to no more than a mile an hour, with supplies running low and dependent on Scott's rule of thumb navigation. On the descent of the glacier Scott and Evans survived a potentially fatal fall into a crevasse, before the discovery of a snow-free area or dry valley, a rare Antarctic phenomenon. Lashly described the dry valley as \\"a splendid place for growing spuds\\". The party reached Discovery on 24 December, after a round trip of seven hundred miles covered in 59 days. Their daily average of over 14 miles on this man-hauling journey was significantly better than that achieved with dogs on the previous season's southern journey, a fact which further strengthened Scott's prejudices against dogs. Polar historian David Crane calls the western journey \\"one of the great journeys of polar history\\". Several other journeys were completed during Scott's absence. Royds and Bernacchi travelled for 31 days on the Barrier in a SE direction, observing its uniformly flat character and making further magnetic readings. Another party had explored the Koettlitz Glacier to the south-west, and Wilson had travelled to Cape Crozier to observe the emperor penguin colony at close quarters. = Second relief expedition = Scott had hoped on his return to find Discovery free from the ice, but she remained held fast. Work had begun with ice saws, but after 12 days' labour only two short parallel cuts of had been carved, with the ship still from open water. On 5 January 1904 the relief ship Morning returned, this time with a second ship, the Terra Nova. Colbeck was carrying firm instructions from the Admiralty that, if Discovery could not be freed by a certain date she was to be abandoned and her complement brought home on the two relief ships. This ultimatum resulted from Markham's dependence on the Treasury for meeting the costs of this second relief expedition, since the expedition's coffers were empty. The Admiralty would foot the bill only on their own terms. The deadline agreed between the three captains was 25 February, and it became a race against time for the relief vessels to reach Discovery, still held fast at Hut Point. As a precaution Scott began the transfer of his scientific specimens to the other ships. Explosives were used to break up the ice, and the sawing parties resumed work, but although the relief ships were able to edge closer, by the end of January Discovery remained icebound, two miles (approx. 3 km) from the rescuers. On 10 February Scott accepted that he would have to abandon her, but on 14 February most of the ice suddenly broke up, and Morning and Terra Nova were at last able to sail alongside Discovery. A final explosive charge removed the remaining ice on 16 February, and the following day, after a last scare when she became temporarily grounded on a shoal, Discovery began the return journey to New Zealand.  Homecoming and results  The Dry Valleys in the western mountains of Victoria Land, discovered during the expedition's western journey. On its return to Britain the expedition's reception was initially muted. Markham was present to meet the ship in Portsmouth when Discovery docked there on 10 September 1904, but no dignitaries greeted the party when it arrived in London a few days later. However, there was considerable public enthusiasm for the expedition, and official recognition followed. Scott was quickly promoted to Captain, and invited to Balmoral Castle to meet King Edward VII, who invested him as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). He also received a cluster of medals and awards from overseas, including the French L√©gion d'honneur. Polar Medals and promotions were given to other officers and crew members. The main geographical results of the expedition were the discovery of King Edward VII Land; the ascent of the western mountains and the discovery of the Polar Plateau; the first sledge journey on the plateau; the Barrier journey to a Furthest South of 82¬∞17‚Ä≤S. The island nature of Ross Island was established, the Transantarctic Mountains were charted to 83¬∞S, (diary entry, 30 December 1902). and the positions and heights of more than 200 individual mountains were calculated. Many other features and landmarks were also identified and named, and there was extensive coastal survey work. There were also discoveries of major scientific importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys in the western mountains, the emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier, scientific evidence that the Ice Barrier was a floating ice shelf, and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.\\"We thus discarded all tinned meats, and every symptom of scurvy rapidly disappeared... [I]n my own case marked scurvy symptoms were dismissed and the disease completely cured without recourse to lime juice. The main thing undoubtedly was, that fresh meat alone was eaten\\" cited from Wilson EA (1905) The medical aspect of the Discovery's voyage to the Antarctic. British Medical Journal 8 July 1905, pp. 77‚Äì80 A general endorsement of the scientific results from the navy's Chief Hydrographer (and former Scott opponent) Sir William Wharton was encouraging. However, when the meteorological data were published their accuracy was disputed within the scientific establishment, including by the President of the Physical Society of London, Dr Charles Chree. Scott defended his team's work, while privately acknowledging that Royds's paperwork in this field had been \\"dreadfully slipshod\\". The expedition succeeded in combating incipient scurvy through a fresh seal meat diet, and Scott recommended it for future polar expeditions.\\"[‚Ä¶] there lies the most invaluable safeguard for the welfare of future Antarctic expeditions; it seems evident that the whole circle of the Antarctic seas is abundantly provided with animal life. It is not conceivable, therefore, that any party wintering in the Antarctic Regions will have great difficulty in providing themselves with fresh food; and, as we have proved, where such conditions exist there need be no fear of the dreaded word 'scurvy.'\\" RF Scott The Voyage of the Discovery Vol I, Smith Elder & Co, London 1905, p. 556 This was despite the medical profession being ignorant of the causes of the disease. At that time it was known that a fresh meat diet could provide a cure, but not that lack of fresh meat or other fresh food containing the as yet undiscovered vitamin C was a cause. Thus, fresh seal meat was taken on the southern journey \\"in case we find ourselves attacked by scurvy\\", (diary entry, 15 October 1902). On his 1907‚Äì09 Nimrod expedition Shackleton also avoided the disease through careful dietary provision, including extra penguin and seal meat. However, Lieutenant Edward Evans almost died of presumably self-inflictedKaren May 2012, Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition, Polar Record, pp. 1‚Äì19 scurvy during the 1910‚Äì13 Terra Nova Expedition, and scurvy was particularly devastating to Shackleton's marooned Ross Sea party during 1915‚Äì16. It remained a danger until its causes were finally established, some 25 years after the Discovery Expedition.  Aftermath  The Vince memorial cross, erected on the Hut Point promontory Scott was given leave from the Navy to write the official expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account in the book of Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement between the two men, particularly over Scott's version of the extent to which his companion had been carried on the sledge. The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown had caused the relatively unimpressive southern record. Scott eventually resumed his naval career, first as an assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful appraisal of the expedition's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something intrinsically more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried forward into later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside. The Discovery Expedition launched the Antarctic careers of several who became stalwarts or leaders of expeditions in the following fifteen years. Apart from Scott and Shackleton, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce from the lower deck returned repeatedly to the ice, apparently unable to settle back into normal life. William Lashly and Edgar Evans, Scott's companions on the 1903 western journey, aligned themselves with their leader's future plans and became his regular sledging partners. Tom Crean followed both Scott and Shackleton on later expeditions. Lieutenant \\"Teddy\\" Evans, first officer on the relief ship Morning, began plans to lead an expedition of his own, before teaming up with Scott in 1910. Soon after resuming his naval duties, Scott revealed to the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was not at that stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, unable to find a safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88¬∞23‚Ä≤, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue. Scott's plans gradually came to fruition ‚Äì a large-scale scientific and geographical expedition with the conquest of the South Pole as its principal objective. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had been associated with the Discovery Expedition's scientific work. He appointed Edward Wilson as his chief scientist, and Wilson selected an experienced team. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Amundsen's party reached the South Pole on 14 December 1911 and returned safely. Scott and four companions, including Wilson, arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912; all five perished on the return journey.

They are an environmental group whose goal is to preserve and protect natural areas in the Don River watershed. History FODE was created in 1993 in the pre-amalgamation borough of East York. The group's original name was \\"Friends of the Don East York\\". The name was shortened in 1998 after amalgamation eliminated East York as a separate municipality. The group was modelled after the Task Force to Bring Back the Don, which at the time was limited to the area within the borders of the old city of Toronto. As a non-governmental organization, they lobbied East York Council to be more environmentally aware, especially with respect to the East York Official Plan and other planning issues. On environmental issues, they opposed the building of the Leslie Street extension. During this time, they persuaded the TRCA to designate Crothers' Woods, which lay directly in the path of the planned extension, as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA). The plan was to extend Redway Road, and is now part of a plan to build a bus- only road as part of the Don Valley Transportation Master Plan. In 2004, FODE attained charitable status. While this limits their ability to perform advocacy work‚ÄîCanadian charities are not supposed to be politically active‚Äîit does allow the organization to raise funds more easily. Governance FODE is governed by a board of directors. The first chair was Stephen Peck, who stayed until 1999. He resigned to focus more attention on his business advocating for green roofs. Programs Another Yard for the Don encouraged homeowners to grow native plants and create pesticide-free zones. Another program, called Trees Count, used an urban-forest initiative called Neighbourwoods to perform a survey of street trees. The survey highlighted the problem of streets lined with trees planted at the same time. Those trees, being of equal age, might die around the same time‚Äîleaving local streets without their leafy canopy. The survey also recommended places where new trees could be grown. =Taylor- Massey Project= One of the group's ongoing projects has been the restoration of the Taylor-Massey Creek watershed. Some of their naturalization projects include the Goulding Estate on Dawes Road and parts of Warden Woods. In 2003, FODE started the Taylor Massey Project. The project's main goal was to highlight issues and concerns that affect the entire watershed. FODE created a web-based portal that divides the watershed into 12 parts called reaches. Each reach was described using a series of aerial photos. Another project goal was to create a walking trail along the entire length of Taylor-Massey Creek. The project intends to improve the poor water quality of the creek and the environment of the surrounding area, raise awareness of watershed issues in neighbouring communities, and create a trail along the length of the creek. , the main volunteers who had founded the TMP and taken the group out of FODE group submitted a 49-page plan for rehabilitating the watershed, Reach by Reach, to the City of Toronto. The five-year, plan called for bike and walking trails, additional forest cover, regeneration of four degraded reaches, and the creation of community steward groups. The plan was the first comprehensive community-organized watershed regeneration plan in Ontario. Activities FODE hosts tree planting events and neighbourhood park cleanups. They also hold walks and bicycle rides that highlight the natural areas in the lower Don watershed, and sponsor workshops that assist local communities to engage in sustainable-living practices. FODE produces a biannual newsletter, At the Forks‚Äîa reference to the Forks of the Don, the confluence of the East and West Branches of the Don, as well as Taylor-Massey Creek.

Professional wrestling career =Early career (1987‚Äì1990)= In 1987, Magliano made his professional debut in Deep South Wrestling (later Southern Championship Wrestling), eventually winning the promotion's Southern Heavyweight Championship twice. Under the ring names Magnificent Magliano and \\"Hotshot\\" Joey Knight, and while teaming with Ricky Lawless as The Heavy Metal Connection, Magliano competed for promotions in Mississippi and Louisiana before eventually finding success in the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association during the early 1990s. =United States Wrestling Association (1990‚Äì1991)= Making his debut in mid-1990, Magliano scored victories over John Tatum and Ken Wayne, before teaming with Rex King to win the USWA Tag Team Titles from the Dirty White Boys (Tony Anthony and Tom Burton) in Memphis on June 23, 1990. Winning a battle royal on June 25, he also defeated Johnny Hotbody, Tom Burton, and The Galaxian (either Dan Marsh or Daniel Briley) in single matches while teaming with King. Successfully defending the tag team titles against the Dirty White Boys (Scott Braddock and Jeff Gaylord), they lost the titles to Brian Lee and Don Harris on August 11. Losing to Brickhouse Brown and Reggie B. Fine two days later, Magliano and King began wrestling single matches, although Magliano suffered losses to Ken Wayne and King Cobra in the next few weeks. Teaming once more with King, Magliano would lose to Doug Gilbert and The New York Brawler on September 10 before returning to a singles career. Losing to Doug Gilbert, MC Jammer, and Danny Davis in late 1990, he would begin teaming with Sheik Fabiano, losing to Brian Christopher and Tony Williams, although he would defeat them in a rematch with Ken Wayne on November 26. During his last months in the promotion, he would briefly hold the USWA Junior Heavyweight Championship, defeating Danny Davis for the title on December 26 before losing it back to him days later on January 6, 1992. =World Championship Wrestling (1991‚Äì1998)= In January 1991, he made his debut as \\"Jumping\\" Joey Maggs in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), losing to Tom Zenk in Dothan, Alabama and, less than a month after his debut, appeared on Clash of the Champions XIV, losing to Sid Vicious on January 30, 1991. Facing \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin in a match for the WCW World Television Championship at Clash of the Champions XV in Knoxville, Tennessee on June 12, he would also lose to Thomas Rich of The York Foundation at Clash of the Champions XVI in Augusta, Georgia on August 5. That same month, Magliano entered the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship Tournament, losing to Badstreet in the opening rounds on August 31. He would also team with Johnny Rich as The Creatures, a masked tag team which appeared at Halloween Havoc that year, losing to Big Josh and P.N. News on October 27, 1991. The next year, although defeating Buddy Lee Parker on January 31, he would lose matches to Big Josh and Tommy Rich before leaving the promotion for a short time. During a brief stint in Smokey Mountain Wrestling in early 1992, he and former rival Danny Davis participated in an eight-team tag team championship tournament for the vacant SMW Tag Team Championship on April 23, scoring an upset victory over Ivan and Vladimir Koloff in the opening rounds before being eliminated by the Heavenly Bodies in the semi-finals. The following month, he and Hector Guerrero defeated Rip Rogers and Barry Horowitz at the supercard Volunteer Slam I on May 22, 1992. He would also make occasional appearances in WCW during the summer, facing Tom Zenk on May 30 and teaming with The Italian Stallion against Arn Anderson and Bobby Eaton on August 16. He also appeared for the World Wrestling Federation, facing Rick \\"The Model\\" Martel and Yokozuna on WWF Prime Time Wrestling later that year. During early 1993, Magliano teamed with Jim Powers at WWF house shows, losing to the Beverly Brothers on February 16. Returning to WCW that same week, Magliano faced The Tasmaniac in a dark match on WCW Saturday Night on February 22, 1993. The following week, he and three other wrestlers were attacked by WCW World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader while attempting to intervene on behalf of Chris Sullivan after defeating Vader via disqualification. Teaming with Marcus Alexander Bagwell, the two lost to Shanghai Pierce and Tex Slazinger and The Wrecking Crew (Rage and Fury). They also later lost to Maxx Payne and NWA World Heavywight Champion Barry Windham in single matches before he and Bagwell broke up, with Magliano losing to his former tag team partner on March 26.

This term also refers to an early method of radio transmission produced by the first radio transmitters, spark gap transmitters, which consisted of a series of damped radio waves. Information was carried on this signal by telegraphy, turning the transmitter on and off (on-off keying) to send messages in Morse code. Damped waves were the first practical means of radio communication, used during the wireless telegraphy era which ended around 1920. In radio engineering it is now generally referred to as \\"Class B\\" emission. However, such transmissions have a wide bandwidth and generate electrical \\"noise\\" (electromagnetic interference) which interferes with other radio transmissions. Because of their potential to cause interference and their resulting wasteful use of radio spectrum resources, there is an international prohibition against the use of class B damped wave radio emissions (except in the USA under Part 15: \\"¬ß15.521 Technical requirements applicable to all UWB devices.

In the United States this is implemented in regulations of the Federal Communications Commission: However the definition of \\"damped waves\\" in these regulations is unclear when applied to modern technology, and recently there have been moves to amend this prohibition to exempt emerging radio technologies such as ultra-wideband transmission systems.

Campus By 1998 the campus had had a total of seven additions, reflecting the growth of the student population in the East End. The school had established a new track and football field, and acquired neighboring property to make room for new additions. In 2012, Richard Connelly of the Houston Press ranked Milby as the fourth most architecturally beautiful high school campus in Greater Houston.Connelly, Richard. \\"The 7 Best-Looking High Schools in Houston.\\" Houston Press.

Academics and academic performance As of 2012, Milby offers technical English courses meant to improve comprehension of non- fiction texts. These courses are offered in addition to standard literature classes.

School uniform In 1999, Milby High School instituted a school uniform policy.\\"Student Dress Code Policy .\\" Milby High School. The Texas Education Agency specified that parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms could apply for a waiver to opt out of the policy so their children did not have to wear the uniform;\\"Uniforms .\\" Texas Education Agency. parents were required to specify \\"bona fide\\" reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections. As of the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, students no longer wear uniforms, but there are strict guidelines and rules as to what they can wear with their \\"free-dress\\", such as the exclusion of spaghetti strap shirts and basketball shorts. No form of gang-related symbols may be present on clothing. Extracurricular activities By 1998 extracurricular clubs in general had declined since many students were too busy to participate; by then many of them had after-school jobs. The school once had a Future Farmers of America club but by 1989 it was disbanded. =Athletics= Historically, the player on the football team considered to be the most valuable would receive the Looney Trophy. Mike Vance, author of Houston's Sporting Life: 1900-1950, described Milam \\"Mike\\" Jones, the first football player from Milby to appear in the Texas North-South All-Star Game, as \\"an early star of Milby football\\".Vance, Mike (Images of America).

In a period beginning around 1972, and as of 1997 the Milby basketball team was mostly made up of African-Americans. By 1998 the school had gained a pep squad with both boys and girls. The previous Girls' Booster Club declined due to a decreasing number of students, and ended in 1994. By 1998 the Coed Cadettes, a marching group that included only female students, had a small number of students. Berryhill wrote that it was the \\"mainstay\\" of Milby when the school first opened.

Mutations that occur after the zygote has formed can be caused by a variety of sources that fall under two classes: spontaneous mutations and induced mutations. How detrimental a mutation is to an organism is dependent on what the mutation is, where it occurred in the genome and when it occurred.  Causes  Post- zygotic changes to a genome can be caused by small mutations that affect a single base pair, or large mutations that affect entire chromosomes and are divided into two classes, spontaneous mutations and induced mutations. = Spontaneous Mutations = Depurination mutation results in one normal strand and one shortened strand after replication. Most spontaneous mutations are the result of naturally occurring lesions to DNA and errors during DNA replication without direct exposure to an agent. A few common spontaneous mutations are: * Depurination- The loss of a purine (A or G) base to form an apurinic site. An apurinic site, also known as an AP site, is the location in a genetic sequence that does not contain a purine base. During replication, the affected double stranded DNA will produce one doubled-stranded daughter containing the missing purine, resulting in an unchanged sequence. The other strand will produce a shorter strand, missing the purine and its complementary base. * Deamination- The amine group on a base is changed to a keto group. This results in cytosine being changed to uracil and adenine being changed to hypoxanthine which can result in incorrect DNA replication and repair. * Tautomerization- The hydrogen atom on a nucleotide base is repositioned causing altered hydrogen bonding pattern and incorrect base pairing during replication. For example, the keto tautomer of thymine normally pairs with adenine, however the enol tautomer of thymine can bind with guanine. This results in an incorrect base pair match. Similarly there are amino and imino tautomers of cytosine and adenine that can cause incorrect base pairing with other nucleotides. = Induced Mutations = Induced mutations are any lesions in DNA caused by an agent or mutagen. Mutagens often demonstrate mutational specificity, meaning they cause predictable changes in the DNA sequence. A few common mutagens that induce mutations are: * Ultraviolet light (UV)- Causes pyrimidine (T or C) nucleotide bases on the same strand to covalent join together forming a pyrimidine dimer. Thymine-thymine dimers are the most common mutation caused by UV light. Since dimers cause a disruptive kink in DNA structure, polymerases often have trouble reading the region, slowing down DNA replication. * Base Analogs- Chemical compounds that are sufficiently similar in structure and chemistry to the nitrogenous bases of DNA, such that they are able to be incorporated in the sequence. These analogs do not have the same pairing properties of normal bases, therefore they can pair incorrectly with nucleotides during replication. 5- bromouracil (5-BU) is a common analog to thymine, however the enol form of 5-BU is still able to bind with adenine. The ionized form, on the other hand, pairs with guanine. * Intercalating agents- Chemical compounds that place themselves between stacked nitrogenous bases in DNA, causing a frameshift mutation. Some intercalating agents, like daunorubicin, are capable of blocking replication and transcription, making them incredibly toxic to proliferating cells. * Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)- Highly reactive oxygen- containing molecules that are capable causing DNA strand breaks and many damaging effects to cellular components. * Alkylating agents- Compounds that attach an alkyl group to the four bases. When an alkyl group is added to guanine, it can lead to the incorrect pairing with thymine and disrupt the accuracy of replication.  Consequences  A large determinant of the severity of consequences caused by post- zygotic mutations is when and where they occur. As a result consequences can range from being negligible to incredibly detrimental. = Mosaicism = Mosaicism arises after the zygote has formed and a mutation occurs during development. The mutated cell line can be passed down to offspring if the germ- cells are affected. When an individual has inherited an abnormality it is usually present in all of their cells. However some mutations like DNA code change, epigenetic alterations and chromosomal abnormalities, can occur later in development. This would result in one progeny cell line to be normal while the other cell line(s) to be abnormal. As a result the individual is considered to be a mosaic of normal and abnormal cells. Mosaicism is the occurrence of two or more cell lines with different genotypes within a single individual. It is different from chimerism which is the fusion of two zygotes, causing a new single zygote with two genotypes.  Loss of chromosome Y  The loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells is the most common human post zygotic mutation. It is highly associated with age, being detectable in at least 10% of blood cells for 14% and 57% of males around 70 and 94 years of age, respectively. Men with LOY have a higher all-cause mortality and cancer mortality compared with unaffected males. Additionally, LOY is associated with greater risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and cardiovascular disease. Smoking increases the risk of inducing LOY more than three times and has a dose- dependent effect on LOY-status.  Trisomy 21 Mosaicism  Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) is one of the most prevalent chromosomal abnormalities amongst live births. Of all trisomy 21 pregnancies, approximately 80% end in spontaneous abortions or still-births. 1-5% of people diagnosed with having Down Syndrome are actually in fact \\"high- grade\\" trisomy 21 mosaics. The rest of trisomy 21 mosaics are marked as \\"low- grade\\" mosaics, meaning the chromosomal mutation occurs in less than 3-5% of respective tissue. While high- grade trisomy 21 mosaics, demonstrate similar features to full Down Syndrome, low- grade mosaics have a tendency to show milder features, however the effects are quite variable depending on the distribution of the trisomic cells. = Somatic mutations = Somatic mutations are the result of a change in the genetic structure after fertilization. This type of mutation also involves cells outside of the reproductive group and thus is not transmitted to future descendants. = Germ- line mutations = Germ- line mutations are the result of a change in the genetic structure of germ cells. These mutations are able to be transmitted to the offspring and give rise to a constitutional mutation. Constitutional mutations is a mutation that when present in one cell, is also present in all other cells associated with the organism.

Cunningham also became a director of both Enterprise GP Holdings and affiliated Duncan Energy Partners LP (). Enterprise Products acquired Enterprise GP Holdings in 2010. Incidents On February 8, 2011, a series of explosions destroyed much of a Mont Belvieu facility owned and operated by Enterprise Products. The ensuing fire was controlled after two hours. One contractor at the plant was not accounted for, however no other injuries were reported. On January 26, 2015, a 20-inch Enterprise Products ATEX pipeline carrying ethane exploded and burned in Brooke County, West Virginia. Despite snow in the area, five acres of woodlands burned, and 1,283,000 gallons of ethane were consumed, or lost. The fireball melted siding on nearby homes and damaged power lines; it is believed that day‚Äôs snowy weather lessened the damage. Reports suspect a girth weld failure from ductile tensile overload, with the pipeline being less than two years old. There were no injuries. On December 1, 2015, personnel from Enterprise discovered a spill at their West Cushing Tank Farm, in Cushing, Oklahoma. Approximately 42,000 gallons of crude oil were released within the terminal. A tank line had failed from internal corrosion. On November 29, 2016, an Enterprise Products pipeline exploded in Platte County, Missouri, burning about 210,000 gallons of an ethane propane mixture. There were no evacuations or injuries. The cause of the failure was stress corrosion cracking.https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320195019/320195019_NOPV%20PCP_05282019.pdf On January 30, 2017, a road crew punctured the Seaway S-1 crude oil pipeline in Texas, which is jointly joined by Enterprise Products Partners and the Canadian Enbridge Inc. through the joint venture Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. Two days later, it was unclear how much oil had spilled over the nearby Highway 121 northeast of Dallas. After the incident, supply concerns reportedly helped push \\"oil prices 2% higher in early trading to nearly $54 a barrel. On December 6, 2017, an Enterprise Products pipeline exploded around 1:30 am near Loving, in southeast New Mexico. Eddy County officials asked residents within a 2-mile radius of the intersection of U.S. Highway 285 and State Road 31 to voluntarily evacuate. Details are still being gathered.

Salem is known for its social conservatism, but Hot Air has maintained its more social libertarian tone.  Viewpoints  Allahpundit's prominence on Hot Air has been a contentious issue for some of the site's ardent Christian conservative readers, as he is often criticized by his own readership for his atheism and for his frequent disagreement with \\"hard-right\\" political opinion, especially on social issues. But his viewpoints are not easily characterized; for instance, he is in favor of same-sex marriage but does not support amnesty for illegal immigrants. Allahpundit's overall writing tone is learned but conversational, deadpan humor, and he is known particularly for his self-deprecating humor and general lack of enthusiasm, for which he has earned the nickname \\"Eeyore\\" or \\"Eeyorepundit.\\" In September 2004, Allahpundit was key to debunking of the Killian documents controversy.

It was a sauropod which lived in what is present-day northern China. The type species, Huabeisaurus allocotus, was first described by Pang Qiqing and Cheng Zhengwu in 2000. Huabeisaurus is known from numerous remains found in the 1990s, which include teeth, partial limbs and vertebrae. Due to its relative completeness, Huabeisaurus represents a significant taxon for understanding sauropod evolution in Asia. Huabeisaurus comes from Kangdailiang and Houyu, Zhaojiagou Town, Tianzhen County, Shanxi province, China. The holotype was found in the unnamed upper member of the Huiquanpu Formation, which is Late Cretaceous (?Cenomanian‚Äì?Campanian) in age based on ostracods, charophytes, and fission-track dating. Huabeisaurus measures long and high, as estimated by Pang and Cheng in 2000. It would have been a quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck and tail, like most other sauropods. The skeleton has been presumed to have belonged to an almost mature individual, because it lacks sutures on vertebrae, but not on pelvic material. A set of 12 characters were identified by D'Emic et al. in 2013 that differentiate Huabeisaurus from other sauropods. An isolated humerus, designated the paratype by Pang and Cheng, comes from a locality over 200 meters away from the type locality of Huabeisaurus, in a fluvially deposited sandy conglomeratic layer in the lower member of the Huiquanpu Formation. This layer is roughly 90 m lower stratigraphically than the type horizon of Huabeisaurus, which comes from the upper member of the Huiquanpu Formation. The humerus thus comes from a stratum representing a different and likely older depositional environment than that of Huabeisaurus, and does not overlap anatomically with the holotypic skeleton, and so cannot currently be referred it. The discoverers erected a new family for the genus, Huabeisauridae, although this family name is not widely used amongst paleontologists. Recently, the family was again proposed, this time by D'Emic et al. because Euhelopodidae, which Huabeisaurus has been assigned to most recently, might have to be split into smaller clades throughout Somphospondyli because of all the taxa assigned to it. Pang and Cheng tentatively suggested that \\"Titanosaurus\\" falloti be referred to Huabeisaurus. One problem, however, is that the femora of Huabeisaurus and \\"T.\\" falloti differ in the bevel of the distal end versus the long axis of the bone, so the two cannot represent the same genus. Description Restoration The Late Cretaceous titanosauriform sauropod Huabeisaurus is known from teeth and much of the postcranial skeleton. Its completeness makes it an important taxon for integrating and interpreting anatomical observations from more fragmentary Cretaceous East Asian sauropods and for understanding titanosauriform evolution in general. Measuring in total length, Huabeisaurus is large when compared to most dinosaurs, but by sauropod standards, it was only midsized. It had a hip height of . Like other sauropods, it would have been a quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck and tail.Upchurch, Paul; Barrett, Paul M., and Dodson, Peter. (2004). \\"Sauropoda\\". In Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka. (eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd ed.). Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 259‚Äì322. The skeleton has been presumed to have belonged to an almost mature individual. The absence of sutures between the neural arches and centra of cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae suggests that the specimen was nearing sexual maturity, but the open sutures between the scapula and coracoid, and the ilium and some sacral ribs suggest that it had not reached full maturity. Discovery and naming The sauropod Huabeisaurus was excavated from Upper Cretaceous sediments of the province of Shanxi, in northeast China. The skeleton was recovered in the 1990s. The holotype of Huabeisaurus is a partially articulated individual composed of teeth, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, complete pectoral and pelvic girdles, and nearly complete limbs. Due to its relative completeness, Huabeisaurus represents a significant taxon for understanding sauropod evolution in Asia. =Material= Image of the skeleton in the position when it was found Limb and girdle elements from the left and right sides of the body closely match each other in size and are the appropriate size to belong to the same individual as the vertebrae and ribs. The disposition of bones in the quarry is approximately as expected if the animal were lying on its left side in an opisthotonic pose, but nearly all bones show some disorientation and disarticulation: the cervical vertebrae are arranged along a curved line, and extending along this tight curve (approximately) sit two of the dorsal vertebrae followed by the sacrum and caudal vertebrae. The sacrum and first three caudal vertebrae were found in articulation and in line with the remaining articulated caudal vertebrae; others are present after a gap of about . Twenty-seven caudal vertebrae are shown on the quarry map, but 30 were found in the collection, and pre- restoration photos indicate that 32 were originally present. Many of the chevrons were found articulated with their respective caudal vertebrae. The left and right scapulae were recovered on the left and right sides of the body, respectively. The left radius was found about midway between the pectoral girdle elements. Left and right femora, pubes, and ilia were located close to one another and all of these were found near the sacrum. The sacrum is depicted with its left side facing upwards on the quarry map, but this might have been an error because the left side of the sacrum is damaged and the left ilium is missing. The elements of the left and right crura were found in close association. Dorsal rib fragments were scattered across the quarry area. In sum, some degree of dispositioning occurred to HBV-20001 before or during burial, resulting in loss and disarticulation of some elements, but the disposition, overall agreement in size, and lack of duplication of bones suggests the presence of a single sauropod individual at this locality. Multiple views of the two assigned teeth Two teeth were preserved. One tooth was discovered in the quarry during excavation and a second was found as field jackets were opened during preparation of the specimen at Shijiazhuang University. The teeth are attributed to the holotype individual based on their close association with other bones and lack of evidence for transport from another site. Both teeth are well preserved, exhibiting wrinkled enamel. The crowns are subcylindrical, with slenderness indices of 3.46 and 3.36, which is slightly more slender than originally described by Pang and Cheng and intermediate in slenderness between broad and narrow-crowned sauropods (e.g., Euhelopus and Phuwiangosaurus). Neither tooth is strongly twisted along its length as in the upper teeth of brachiosaurids. A total of four cervical vertebrae were recovered from the holotypic quarry. Two of these are fragmentary, whereas the other two vertebrae are nearly complete. According to the quarry map, the two poorly preserved cervical vertebrae were articulated when found and belong to a more anterior part of the cervical series than the nearly complete vertebrae. Little anatomical information can be gleaned from the two fragmentary cervical vertebrae aside from some measurements. Only the capitula, tubercula, and part of the anterior and posterior processes of the cervical ribs are preserved. The ribs are fused to their respective vertebrae. The cervical ribs are pendant, extending ventrally for a distance subequal to the height of the centrum, as in several other East Asian Cretaceous sauropods. In both cervical vertebrae, the tuberculum is notably slender anteroposteriorly, especially in comparison with the capitulum. The cervical ribs are currently broken, but the original description notes that at least some originally exceeded centrum length. Parts of six dorsal vertebrae are preserved: one partial anterior dorsal vertebral neural arch, one partial dorsal vertebral centrum, three posterior dorsal vertebrae that are nearly complete but currently heavily reconstructed with plaster, and one that has been plastered into the sacrum. None of the dorsal vertebrae have observable neurocentral sutures. Sacrum A nearly complete sacrum consisting of six vertebrae was recovered from the quarry, originally only lacking some ribs. The original description of Huabeisaurus suggested that only five sacral vertebrae were present based on the number of sacral ribs and intercostal foramina. The sacrum is currently heavily restored with plaster, but pre- restoration photographs show the sacrum in two oblique dorsal views and right lateral view. These photographs reveal that the last dorsal vertebra was taphonomically shifted posteriorly and to the right, crushing the right first sacral rib. Pre-restoration photographs and the number of broken sacral neural spines currently visible indicate that the sacrum was composed of at least six vertebrae. The first vertebra crushed into the sacrum could represent a seventh sacral vertebra; because the ribs of this dorsal vertebra are not observable firsthand or in photographs, but it cannot be verified whether or not these ribs contacted the ilium. The vertebra was interpreted as the last dorsal vertebra because: its neural spine does not appear to be fused to the neural spine posterior to it, and the usual sacral vertebral count for all but the most basal somphospondylans is six (with seven vertebrae in Neuquensaurus as the only derived exception). Eleven chevrons were listed in the holotype of Huabeisaurus by Pang and Cheng, but thirteen are visible in pre-reconstruction photographs, and twelve are currently present in the Museum of Shijiazhuang University. These elements correspond to positions covering nearly the entire length of the preserved caudal vertebral series. The chevrons are generally well preserved, but there is some distortion and damage. The correspondence of chevrons to particular caudal vertebrae is uncertain. Scapula Although the exact orientation of the pectoral girdle in vivo is uncertain, the scapulae and coracoids are generally thought to have been oblique to the major planes of orientation of the rest of the body, rendering orientational descriptors somewhat difficult to select. Aside from the glenoid region, which is damaged or missing in both specimens, the preserved parts of the left and right scapulae complement one another to give a full picture of the morphology of the element. The scapulae consist of a broad proximal plate comprising an acromion and acromial fossa and a blade that forms more than half the length of the bone. The lateral surface of the acromial plate is excavated anterior to the acromial ridge and dorsal to the glenoid region. The acromial ridge is slightly posteriorly deflected, such that it is oriented at an acute angle to the long axis of the scapular blade. Immediately posterior to the glenoid articular surface, the ventral margin of the scapula is broad and convex transversely, but rapidly narrows as it merges into the base of the blade. No prominent subtriangular process seems to occur along the posteroventral edge of the proximal scapula, though its absence could be due to damage. A broad ridge extends longitudinally along the proximal third of the lateral face of the blade. The dorsal margin of the blade is straight, whereas the ventral margin expands distally such that the ratio of the maximum to minimum blade dorsoventral height is 1.7, less than the originally described value of ca. 2. The development of the acromion and distal expansion of the blade are similar to those of other somphospondylans and not as marked as in rebbachisaurids. The left radius is damaged at its proximal and distal ends. The radius is gracile, with a midshaft width to length ratio of 0.12. In anterior view, the lateral face of the shaft is straight, whereas the medial face is concave. The anteroposteriorly expanded proximal end has a prominent ridge on its lateral face. The proximal end has an approximately oval outline with a pointed anterior process and broadly rounded posterior process. The proximomedial margin is nearly straight, whereas the proximolateral margin is concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly. The oval cross-section of the upper shaft gradually transforms into a rounded D-shape at mid-shaft, with the long axis of the cross section extending transversely. This ‚ÄòD‚Äô shape becomes more anteriorly compressed towards the distal end, with a transversely rounded anterior face and increasingly flattened posterior face. This is associated with the strong transverse expansion of the distal shaft and distal end of the bone, as originally described as a twisting of the bone. Strong transverse expansion of the distal radius is normally found only in titanosaurs (e.g., Alamosaurus and Jainosaurus) and is considered a local autapomorphy of Huabeisaurus. Posterolateral ridges are weak to absent along the distal half of the bone and do not extend further proximally. Classification Alternate view of mount The original description of the species noted strong similarities between the osteology of Huabeisaurus and other Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, and in general, previous studies have pointed to some East Asian Cretaceous sauropod (like Nemegtosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus) as the sister taxon of Huabeisaurus. Since 2000, the year of the original description of Huabeisaurus, 17 new sauropod species have been erected from the Cretaceous of East Asia. Many authors have noted similarities among Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, often suggesting that several of these taxa belong to a clade grounded on a genus with well-known anatomy (like Nemegtosauridae, Opisthocoelicaudinae, and Euhelopodidae). Cladistic support was recently presented for a Euhelopodidae that consisted of exclusively Cretaceous-aged members, in contrast with traditional studies and early cladistic analyses that placed the existence of a Euhelopodidae with Jurassic forms. Both earlier and later analyses suggest some degree of endemism in East Asia, though its temporal duration remains uncertain. On a broader scale, an interesting evolutionary pattern has been recognized wherein all pre-Cretaceous Jurassic Asian sauropods lie outside of Neosauropoda, whereas all Cretaceous Asian sauropods are titanosauriforms. Refining and explaining these paleobiogeographic patterns through time rests on detailed comparisons and comprehensive phylogenetic studies including East Asian sauropods, which are currently lacking. Femur Huabeisaurus has never been incorporated into a cladistic analysis, but several authors have commented on its affinities on comparative grounds. Buffetaut et al. reviewed the sauropods of Thailand and described Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous teeth similar to those of euhelopodids (in the traditional sense, i.e., Euhelopus, Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus) and others more reminiscent of Nemegtosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus (which they termed nemegtosaurids). Following these comparisons, Huabeisaurus was regarded as a nemegtosaurid by Buffetaut et al.. Upchurch et al. considered Huabeisaurus to represent a titanosauriform or titanosaur outside of Lithostrotia on the basis of a variety of features. You et al. suggested a close relationship between Huabeisaurus, Borealosaurus, and Opisthocoelicaudia. Mo et al. highlighted similarities among Huabeisaurus, Fusuisaurus, and Sonidosaurus. Tanimoto et al. considered Huabeisaurus to be closely related to Nemegtosaurus, Borealosaurus and the ‚ÄúToba sauropod‚Äù of Japan (as members of Nemegtosauridae). Finally, it has recently been suggested by D'emic et al. that Huabeisaurus is a member of Euhelopodidae. A new family was erected to place Huabeisaurus in, along with the closely related Tangvayosaurus. The family was named Huabeisauridae. Recently, the family was again proposed, this time by D'Emic et al. because Euhelopodidae, which Huabeisaurus has been assigned to most recently, might have to be split into smaller clades throughout the Somphospondyli because of all the taxa assigned to it. Pang and Cheng tentatively suggested that \\"Titanosaurus\\" falloti be referred to Huabeisaurus. However, \\"T.\\" falloti is only represented by femoral remains, and its femur bears no uniquely shared features with Huabeisaurus. Furthermore, the femora of Huabeisaurus and \\"T.\\" falloti differ in the bevel of the distal end versus the long axis of the bone, so the two cannot represent the same genus. =Distinguishing characteristics= Dorsal vertebra According to D'Emic et al. (2013) Huabeisaurus can be distinguished based on this set of autapomorphies: the division of some presacral vertebral laminae; posterior cervical vertebrae with a divided prezygodiapophyseal lamina; anterior dorsal vertebrae with a divided anterior spinodiapophyseal lamina; the presence of postzygapophyseal spinodiapophyseal fossa that are larger than postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa on anterior-middle caudal vertebrae; caudal vertebrae with small caudal ribs that disappear around caudal vertebra eight; ventrally one-third of anterior-middle caudal vertebral centra expanded posteriorly; two longitudinal ridges on the lateral faces of mid-caudal vertebral centra; a coracoid with tubercle near anterodorsal edge of lateral face; the distal end of radius about twice as broad transversely as midshaft (convergently acquired in derived titanosaurs); a tubercle on ischial plate that projects from posterior margin; the development of fossae relative to one another in caudal vertebral neural arches; and a high tibia-to-femur ratio. Paleoecology Stratigraphic map of the area around the discovery site of Huabeisaurus An isolated humerus, designated the paratype by Pang and Cheng, comes from a locality over 200 meters away from the type locality of Huabeisaurus, in a fluvially deposited sandy conglomeratic layer in the lower member of the Huiquanpu Formation. This layer is roughly 90 m lower stratigraphically than the type horizon of Huabeisaurus, which comes from the upper member of the Huiquanpu Formation. The humerus thus comes from a stratum representing a different and likely older depositional environment than that of Huabeisaurus, and does not overlap anatomically with the holotypic skeleton, and so cannot currently be referred to that taxon. The horizon that yielded the humerus also contains hadrosaurid specimens referred to cf. Shantungosaurus sp. and indeterminate ankylosaurid material. Huabeisaurus comes from Kangdailiang and Houyu, Zhaojiagou Town, Tianzhen County, Shanxi province, China. The holotype was found in the unnamed upper member of the Huiquanpu Formation, which is Late Cretaceous (?Cenomanian‚Äì?Campanian) in age based on ostracods, charophytes, and fission-track dating. The geology of the type locality of the Huiquanpu Formation was described in a series of reports. The specimen was found near the base of the upper member of the Huiquanpu Formation, in a fluvially deposited silty mudstone. This locality has also produced the ankylosaur Tianzhenosaurus, theropod material referred to cf. Szechuanosaurus campi (now regarded as a nomen dubium), and indeterminate hadrosaurid material. This species also coexisted with ostracods and charophytes, and the ankylosaurian Shanxia, considered by Weishampel et al. to be ankylosauria indet.

He served as the mayor of Laval, Quebec, from June 8, 1989 until November 9, 2012, when he was charged, and ultimately found guilty, with corruption and fraud. During this time Vaillancourt was also the leader of the Parti PRO des Lavallois.\\"RIP: PRO des Lavallois\\". The Gazette, November 19, 2012.  Career  He first served on Laval City Council in 1973 as alderman for the district of Laval-des-Rapides in the party of former mayor Dr. Lucien Paiement, then in the party of the mayor Claude Lefebvre who founded the Parti du Ralliement Officiel (PRO de Laval) in 1980. In 1989, he took over as mayor and as party leader from Lefebvre. Vaillancourt was president of the Union of Municipalities of Quebec from April 1995 to April 1997. He was reelected mayor in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009 with a majority of candidates. In the 2005 Laval municipal election, Vaillancourt was re-elected with a large majority: 74.61% compared to 16% for his nearest opponent, Audrey Boisvert, an 18-year-old student. Under his administration, the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro was extended to Laval in 2007. Following this extension, he suggested that a further six stations be added to the line. Three of these would be in Laval and three in Montreal, in order to create a loop out of the orange line.Courrier Laval ‚Äì Actualit√©s ‚Äì Montr√©al a bien d‚Äôautres priorit√©s During the 2009 Laval municipal election, Vaillancourt was re-elected with a majority of 61.3%, compared to 22.64% for Lydia Aboulian, mayoral candidate for the Mouvement lavallois. Vaillancourt also sat at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and chairs the Committee of municipal finances.  Resignation, trial, and prison  As part of the Commission of Inquiry on the Awarding and Management of Public Contracts in the Construction Industry, the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit () inquired and searched Vaillancourt's residence for evidence of corruption, as well as Laval City Hall and two other administrative buildings on October 4, 2012. The inquiries occurred in a wide search for contracts which were attributed during Gilles Vaillancourt's mandate.Article du Soleil, ¬´ Perquisition chez le maire de Laval ¬ª On the evening of October 5, 2012, the UPAC searched Vaillancourt's condominium, which was his other place of residence.

Police from the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec also raided more than ten safety deposit boxes rented by Vaillancourt at various financial institutions. Later that same day, Vaillancourt announced that he would be temporarily leaving his function as mayor for health reasons. On November 9, 2012, Vaillancourt resigned as mayor and denied all of the corruption allegations against him.

He is perhaps best known under the ring name P.N. News and for his stints in Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. He currently works on the European independent circuit as Cannonball Grizzly and in the United Kingdom as American Avalanche. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1987‚Äì1991)= After debuting in 1987 and a two-year run in the Don Owen owned, Portland Territory as The Avalanche, Neu traveled to Europe to compete for the Catch Wrestling Association under the ring name Cannonball Grizzly in 1989. =World Championship Wrestling (1991‚Äì1992)= Upon his return to the United States in 1991, Neu joined World Championship Wrestling. He made his debut for the promotion on the May 11 episode of World Wide Wrestling as P.N. News, a rapper gimmick fashioned after P.M. Dawn, where he defeated Terry Bronson in 44 seconds. He soon began a brief feud against World Television Champion \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin. At The Great American Bash, News and Bobby Eaton defeated Austin and his partner Terry Taylor in a scaffold match. During a house show on June 21, News inadvertently injured Dave Sheldon, who was performing under the ring name the Angel of Death. The injury came about when News botched his Broken Record finishing move during their match, as he splashed Sheldon's knees instead of his torso, which sidelined Sheldon for almost an entire year in order to recover. As a result, News was taken off television, his feud with Austin was dropped, and he was used solely at house shows and sporadically at pay-per-views. Despite this, News faced Austin in a match for the World Television Title at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, but was unsuccessful in winning the title. After their feud, News was moved down the card and on December 21 at Starrcade, News teamed with Steve Armstrong in a losing effort to Ron Simmons and Thomas Rich. On January 21, 1992, News made his final television appearance, defeating Diamond Dallas Page at Clash of the Champions XVIII. Following this, News wrestled solely on house shows before being released on March 15, 1992. =Catch Wrestling Association (1992‚Äì1998) = After leaving WCW, Neu returned to the Catch Wrestling Association in late 1992 under his Cannonball Grizzly ring name and gimmick. On November 5, 1995, Grizzly and John Hawk defeated August Smisl and Ulf Herman to win the World Tag Team Championship for the first time. On December 16, Grizzly and Hawk lost the titles to Smisl and Tony St. Clair. After the loss, Grizzly began teaming with his cousin Bruiser Mastino, with their tag team being known as The Brotherhood. On July 7, 1996, Grizzly and new tag team partner Jesse James Armstrong won the World Tag Team Title before losing them to August Smisl and Ulf Herman on August 3. After the title was vacated, Grizzly and Wildcat Brookside won the title on December 21 after defeating Tony St. Clair and Mick Tierney in a tournament. They would hold the title until it was vacated in July 1997. On October 10, 1998, Grizzly would then face Brookside to determine who would claim the vacant Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, but he lost the match via countout. Neu left the promotion in late 1998. =British wrestling (1993-present)= Neu was also a familiar face in British Wrestling at this time, wrestling for All Star Wrestling as American Avalanche and for Orig Williams' BWF as Raging Bull, including appearances on Williams' Reslo Welsh language TV wrestling show on S4C. Fellow wrestler Robbie Brookside's Video Diary filmed in 1993 for BBC2, includes footage of Neu both in the ring and backstage out of character. Neu, as Avalanche, has continued to make appearances for All Star into the 21st century, often teaming with Joe E Legend as an arrogant American heel tag team, or as part of the World Riot Squad heel faction. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999)= On September 17, 1999, Neu, under his P.N. News ring name and character, debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling in a losing effort to Spike Dudley. News then joined Da Baldies, a heel stable composed of wrestlers who were all bald. At November to Remember, Da Baldies (News, Spanish Angel, Tony DeVito and Vito LoGrasso) defeated New Jack and The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney) in a handicap match. On November 19, News and LoGrasso lost to The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks in a Loser Leaves Town match, ending Neu's stint in ECW. =Hiatus and Return (2000‚Äìpresent)= On November 17, 2000, Neu, as Cannonball Grizzly, returned to wrestling and won the European Wrestling Promotion's first-ever Hardcore Knockout Tournament after defeating Hercules Harrison in the semi-finals and then Big Tiger Steel in the finals. Ten days later, he won the EWP World Heavyweight Championship after defeating Bam Bam Bigelow. On November 26, 2003, Grizzly lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Thunder. On December 17, 2011, Grizzly defeated Thunder to reclaim the EWP World Heavyweight Title. On October 6, 2012, he defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Fit Finlay, although their match ended in a no contest and thus resulted in Grizzly retaining the World Heavyweight Title. Personal life Neu was married to a woman named Connie. He has since married Anja von Stanic, whom he also trained as a professional wrestler in 2007 and managed him while both were members of a stable called The Firm before Anja retired from professional wrestling in 2008. He is also a first cousin of Mike Halac, who was best known for his stint in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Mantaur.

He is considered the father of orthopaedic surgery in Britain. Early life Hugh Owen Thomas descended from a young boy who had been shipwrecked in Anglesey in 1745. Given the name Evan Thomas by the family that adopted and raised him, he established a family tradition of bone- setting. Evan Thomas ‚Äî the grandson of the original survivor, and Hugh‚Äôs father ‚Äî had moved to Liverpool at the age of 19, where he set up a successful practice as bone-setter. Evan, however, was not a trained physician, and three times he was taken to court to defend his practice. Although he was never convicted, the constant jealousy and antagonism of the medical community was a great toll on him; at one point his cottage was even burned down. As a result of this, he decided to send all his five sons to train and qualify as doctors. Professional career Hugh trained with his uncle, Owen Roberts at St. Asaph in North Wales for four years, then he studied medicine at Edinburgh and University College, London. He qualified as MRCS in 1857. Returning to Liverpool, he first worked with his father, but incompatible temperaments did not allow this for long, so in 1859 he set up his own practice in the poorer part of town. Hugh was known as an eccentric and rather temperamental man. A rumour had it that he would attack victims himself, and break their bones, in order to have patients on which to practice. He was short; just over five feet tall, always wore a black coat buttoned all the way up, a patch over one eye, and constantly had a cigarette in his mouth. Among the poor people of Liverpool though, he stood in great esteem. He practiced from his home in No. 11, Nelson Street, where he worked all day from five or six in the morning, and every Sunday he would treat patients for free. Medical legacy His contribution to British orthopaedics was manifold. In the treatment of fractures and tuberculosis he advocated rest, which should be 'enforced, uninterrupted and prolonged'. In order to achieve this he created the so- called 'Thomas Splint', which would stabilise a fractured femur and prevent infection. He is also responsible for numerous other medical innovations that all carry his name: 'Thomas's collar' to treat tuberculosis of the cervical spine, 'Thomas's manoeuvre', an orthopaedic investigation for fracture of the hip joint, Thomas test, a method of detecting hip deformity by having the patient lying flat in bed, 'Thomas's wrench' for reducing fractures, as well as an osteoclast to break and reset bones. The 'Thomas heel' is part of a shoe for children consisting of a heel one-half inch (12 mm) longer, and an eighth to a sixth of an inch (4 to 6 mm) higher on the inside. This is used to bring the heel of the foot into varus deformity, and to prevent depression in the region of the head of the ankle bone.http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Thomas+heel His work was never fully appreciated in his own lifetime, but when his nephew, Sir Robert Jones, applied his splint during the First World War, this reduced mortality of compound fractures of the femur from 87% to less than 8% in the period from 1916 to 1918.

Summit serves as a suburb to the city of Ashland and shares the city's ZIP code. Summit is sometimes spelled with two \\"T's\\" at the end, although the most common spelling contains only one \\"T\\" but either variation is accepted as correct. Summit is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. The Summit name was first applied to a 19th-century railroad passenger and freight station located at the site. Summit was selected as descriptive of the location's unique topographical features including a flat terrain on a higher elevation than other parts of the surrounding area. Unusual for the region, this terrain was created by the ancient Teay's River and the associated Glacial Lake Tight. The Lexington, Elizabethtown, and Big Sandy Railroad opened a station here in the late 19th century after the railroad was constructed through Summit. It served the residents of what was then a sparsely populated farming community until the station was closed due to its close proximity to Ashland made it no longer necessary. Now a populated suburban area, Summit's development was slow until the Federal Correctional Institution was located at the heart of Summit on Kentucky Route 716. This and the upgrading of U.S. Route 60, made transportation easier for residents to commute to and from Ashland.

In addition, Fedigan is also the Executive Editor of the American Journal of Primatology and a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Prior to accepting her current position, Dr. Fedigan was a professor at the University of Alberta, teaching anthropology from 1974 until 2001. She is internationally recognized for over 30 years of contribution to the study of primate life history, reproduction, socioecology and conservation and is considered a major authority on the life history and reproductive patterns of female primates. Education Fedigan was born in Oklahoma and began her formal studies in anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin, where she completed bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. Originally, she had plans to become a cultural anthropologist but later decided to focus on primatology due to her interest in sociality. She earned a Ph.D in 1974 for her study of social roles in a transplanted troop of Japanese monkeys living on the Arashiyama West Primate Research Station at LaMoca, Texas. Research Fedigan's focus is on social structure, sex differences, reproduction, behavioural ecology and conservation of Costa Rica and Japanese monkeys. Fedigan was one of the first female primatologists who elected to study female life histories and male- female interactions. Past research projects include the Arashiyama West Primate Research Station, the Santa Rosa Primate Field Project and examinations of gender and science (descriptions included in this article). =The Arashiyama West-East Primate Project= Research on a group of Arashiyama Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) began near Kyoto, Japan in 1954. In the summer of 1966, the group naturally separated forming two troops and in 1972, one of the two troops was translocated to Texas for research and training of American and Japanese students. The troops were renamed Arashiyama West and East. In Texas, the troop of 150 macaques was given free range over a 42.4 ha enclosure of brush land. Fedigan was involved in this project in Texas from the time of translocation in 1972 until data collection ceased in 1996. From 1978 to 1979 Fedigan was Field Station Manager and spent over three years living with the macaques. Her research now focuses upon analysis of the data collected, in particular the reproductive and life history patterns in females. Male emigration, female kinship, inbreeding avoidance, the structure of group fission, friendship, and dominance and reproductive success are just a few of the ideas that were foreshadowed and/or influenced by the results from Arashiyama studies. In 1991, Dr. Fedigan co-edited with Pamela Asquith \\"The Monkeys of Arashiyama: 35 Years of Research in Japan and the West,\\" SUNY Press. The work explores research on the Arashiyama Japanese macaques and Japanese and Western traditions in primate studies and reflects on how different cultural perspectives influence the manner in which the science of primatology is approached. =The Santa Rosa Primate Field Project= In 1983, with the cooperation of the Costa Rican government, Dr. Fedigan established the Santa Rosa Primate Field Project with the objective of describing the behavioural ecology, conservation parameters and life histories of three primate species inhabiting the park - white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus), mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) and black-handed spider moneys (Ateles geoffroyi). The setting is Santa Rosa National Park which was established in 1970 and is located approximately 35 km northwest of Liberia, Costa Rica. The park consists of 108 square kilometres of land containing a mix of former pasture-land, dry deciduous forest and semi-evergreen forest. In addition to frequent censuses, Fedigan and her group of researchers have conducted intensive, longitudinal studies on several groups within the park, including life history data on selected female capuchins. In 1998, Fedigan's work was the subject of a film produced by Omni Film Productions Ltd. entitled \\"Costa Rican Monkeys.\\" The film formed part of a series of recordings referred to as \\"Champions of the Wild\\" (Discovery Channel) focusing on endangered animals around the globe and the champions determined to save them. Her research resulted in her coauthoring a book entitled \\"The Complete Capuchin\\" which explores the lives of capuchin monkeys in relation to their lives in nature, including their physical, mental and social characteristics. In addition, the book provides information about how humans have viewed, used and studied these monkeys from ancient times to the present. =Gender and science= Regarding gender and science, Fedigan's interest began with how the gender of the scientist affects research on sex differences and moved to a broader focus on the role of gender in scientific disciplines. Fedigan has written numerous papers on the topic including the role of women in models of human evolution, feminism and primatology, science and the successful female, and historical analyses of the effects of gender on changing views of life history research. She is also the first scholar to examine both the images of women in theories of human evolution and the role of women scientists in constructing these images. In 1996 Fedigan co-hosted, with Shirley Strum, an international Wenner-Gren conference in Teresopolis, Brazil on \\"Changing Images of Primate Societies: The Role of Theory, Method and Gender.\\" As a result of the conference, the two collaborated in 2000 in co-editing \\"Primate Encounters: Models of Science, Gender and Society\\". The book is an anthology of articles from various scientists investigating the discipline of primatology and its connection to broader cultural, historical and social issues. Goddess's discipline? Fedigan has also explored the question, raised both within primatology and within the science studies and feminist communities, of what truth there is behind the playful observation that primatology is the \\"Goddess's discipline.\\" In 1994, Dr. Fedigan set out to investigate whether or not there was a disproportionate number of females in primatology (relative to the other sciences) and if so, why? In her article \\"Science and the Successful Female: Why There Are so Many Women Primatologists,\\" Fedigan's research confirms that there are significantly more women in primatology than in general biology and more women studying primates than other types of organisms. There are not, however, more women primatologists than there are women in the parental disciplines (anthropology, psychology and animal behaviour). She also notes that, in general, there has been a considerable increase in the number of women practitioners across a wide variety of life science disciplines. As to the \\"why,\\" Fedigan offers the following explanations: * Primatology is a fairly young discipline and women tend to fare better in new and rapidly growing disciplines. * The intellectual location of the discipline: *# Women are concentrated in the social and life sciences (primatology is a life science with a strong focus on social behaviour) *# Primatology is an offshoot of anthropology, psychology and animal behavior - all of which also have strong female representation *# Women might fare better in the marginal or maverick areas of science *# General atmosphere of goodwill toward women - primatology has been praised as an \\"equal opportunity\\" science *A tradition of strong female role models within the discipline. * Influential male mentors encouraging women to enter the science and further offering critical support allowing female students to penetrate what are otherwise male-dominated networks. * Impact of media coverage of women in primatology on young women in general - including \\"National Geographic\\" magazines and films featuring Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas (The Trimates). Honours and awards On June 30, 2016, Fedigan was named a Member of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for \\"her contributions to advancing our understanding of the behaviour and society of several primate species and for her dedication as a mentor to the next generation of primatologists.\\" In 2016, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Penetrating skin Insects piercing the skin of mammals are familiar in creatures such as mosquitoes, but the moth uses a specially developed proboscis to penetrate the skin of animals, such as buffalo. A species in Malaysia was observed using its hollowed out proboscis which is divided into two halves. The insect rocks the proboscis from one side to the other, applying pressure until it pierces the skin. It then uses a rocking head motion to drill the tube deeper into the skin. The blood pressure of the victim supplies power to raise hooks on the proboscis to ensure the insect is not easily detached.Our Amazing World: Wonders hidden below the surface By Avrohom Katz, p, , accessed 20 October 2008 Only male moths exhibit this ability, unlike mosquitoes, where the female is the one that drinks blood. It is thought that the moth's ability to pierce animal skin and drink blood may have sprung from an earlier ability to pierce fruit in search of juice. Human skin penetrated in this way may turn red and be sore for several hours leaving an itchy rash. Despite the bite being more severe than that of a mosquito, the moths do not pose a risk to humans. Although it has been reported that moths have bitten humans in Asia, it was not until the summer of 1999 that a Russian scientist, Vladimir Kononenko, observed that this species of moth was capable of filling its stomach with human blood.

For around 30 years, the vaults were used to house taverns, workshops for cobblers and other tradesmen, as well as storage space for said merchants. In later years, the vaults were a hotspot for the homeless and for criminal activity such as illegal gambling taverns, illegal whisky distillery and, according to rumour, bodysnatchers stored corpses there overnight. There is however no proof that the serial killers Burke and Hare ever used the vaults. As the conditions in the vaults deteriorated, mainly because of damp and poor air quality, the businesses left in the 1820s and the very poorest of Edinburgh's citizens moved in, though by around 1860, even they are believed to have left too. That people had lived there was only discovered in 1985 during an excavation, when middens were found containing toys, medicine bottles, plates, and other signs of human habitation.Edinburgh's South Bridge and the Edinburgh Vaults, Historic UK.com, accessed 4 October 2009. Background Edinburgh was a growing community in the late 18th century and two bridges were built to facilitate the expansion, North Bridge and South Bridge, known locally as 'The Bridges'. The South Bridge, built to span the Cowgate gorge between High Street and the growing University of Edinburgh on the Southside, was first proposed in 1775, although work did not begin until August 1785.What Lies Beneath? - Edinburgh's South Bridge and the Edinburgh Vaults. Historic UK Edinburgh's South Bridge should be regarded as more than a simple crossing from Old Town to Southside. It was, in fact, Edinburgh's first purpose-built shopping street, and as such as much space as possible was utilised. The bridge itself is a nineteen arch viaduct, although only one arch is visible today, the 'Cowgate arch.' The remaining eighteen arches were enclosed behind tenement buildings built to allow the area to serve as a commercial district. The hidden arches of the bridge were then given extra floors to allow their use for industry. In total there are approximately 120 rooms or 'vaults' beneath the surface of the South Bridge, ranging in size from two metres squared to forty metres squared. South Bridge officially opened for business on 1 March 1788. History Inside the vaults The vault rooms, used as storage space and workshops for the South Bridge businesses, operated as intended for a relatively short space of time. Construction of the bridge had been rushed and the surface was never sealed against water. The vaults began to flood. Abandonment of the vaults began as early as 1795. With the vaults being gradually abandoned by the businesses on the bridge, the empty rooms were adopted and adapted by new users. As the industrial revolution took hold of Britain, the Cowgate area had developed into Edinburgh's slum. Slum dwellers took over the vaults and they became a renowned red light district with countless brothels and pubs operating within the abandoned complex. The vaults also served as additional slum housing for the city‚Äôs poor. Living conditions were appalling. The rooms were cramped, dark and damp. There was no sunlight, poorly circulated air, no running water, and no sanitation. Many rooms housed families of more than ten people. Crimes, including robbery and murder, soon plagued the Vaults. Burke and Hare, the infamous serial killers who sold corpses to medical schools, are said to have hunted for victims in the Edinburgh Vaults. On Saturday 1 July 1815, the Edinburgh Evening Courant reported that: :On the 24th inst. Mr McKenzie, supervisor, accompanied by Mess. Gorie and McNaugton, officers, discovered a private distillery, of considerable extent, under the arch of the South Bridge, which has been working these 18 months past, to the great injury of the revenue. The particulars of this seizure are worthy of notice, from the great pains which had been taken to prevent disclosure. The original door to the place where the operations were going forward had been carefully built up and plastered over, so as to prevent any appearance of an entrance. Behind a grate in the fireplace of a bed-room, an opening had been made, and fitted with an iron door and lock, exactly fitting the grate, which could only be seen by being removed; and this passage led to the flat above by a trap-door and ladder, where the still was working. This place again was in one of the deaf arches, immediately adjoining the middle arch of the bridge, (now The Caves venue), and the person had found means to convey a pipe from one of the town‚Äôs branches, which gave a plentiful supply of water. A soil pipe was also got at, and a hole broke through into a neighbouring vent to carry off the smoke. Besides the still, a considerable quantity of wash, and some low wines, were found in the premises; also many casks, mash ton, large tubs, etc. The spirits were said to have been conveyed away in a tin case, made to contain two or three gallons, which was again put into a green bag, and carried out by a woman under her cloak. It is not known when the vaults complex was closed down, with some suggesting as early as c.1835 and others as late as c.1875. Written records regarding the vaults during their slum use are virtually non- existent. All that is known is that at some point tons of rubble were dumped into the vaults making them inaccessible. The vaults were rediscovered by former Scottish rugby internationalist, Norrie Rowan, after he found a tunnel leading to them in the 1980s. From this tunnel he helped Romanian rugby player Cristian Raducanu escape the Romanian secret police and seek political asylum weeks before the Romanian Revolution of 1989.Reid, Alisdair. Romania comes in from the cold, The Sunday Herald, 5 November 2006. The vaults were excavated by Norrie Rowan and his son Norman Rowan in the 1990s. Hundreds of tonnes of rubble were removed by hand and several interesting artifacts were discovered including thousands of oyster shells, which were part of the staple diet of the Edinburgh working class. Current uses of the Edinburgh Vaults The vaults on the North Side of the Cowgate arch form a series of tunnels and vaults and are mainly used for ghost tours. The vaults on the South side of the Cowgate arch form a venue called The Caves and The Rowantree, which hosts private events, weddings, private dining, live music and the occasional club night. There are areas within The Caves that are the building remains of what was Adam Square, that were demolished to make way for the erection of the South Bridge. The original terracotta floor tiles, a hearth stone, and what remains of fireplace, were found in one of the rooms within The Caves whilst it was being excavated. In another room, within The Caves, a well was found. During the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August, the vaults that make up The Caves and The Rowantree, along with several normally unused vaults, are transformed into a major festival venue hosting over 60 different shows a day. Paranormal reports The television show Ghost Adventures investigated the vaults and claimed to have numerous encounters with spirits there. In 2009 a BBC TV production team filming a one-off TV special featuring Joe Swash recorded unexplained voices in the vaults during an overnight sleepover by Swash. Swash was the only person in the vaults and did not hear the voices himself at the time of recording, despite the sounds being audible on his own microphone. The voices continued to be heard on the recording for some 20 minutes before abruptly ceasing after what appears to be the sound of children yelling. BBC sound engineers initially thought the sounds may be explained by voices drifting into the tunnels from nightclubs nearby but this was found to be incorrect and no logical explanation could be found although they may well have been weak radio signals being picked up by the BBC microphones. The recordings were broadcast as part of the finished program Joe Swash Believes in Ghosts on BBC Three in January 2010. As of 2015, most of the whole area is now closed to the public, and access is strictly monitored.

It was a theropod, specifically a coelurosaur, which lived in the Cenomanian to Turonian of the Cretaceous period, between 96-91 million years ago. The type species, Aniksosaurus darwini, was formally described from the Bajo Barreal Formation of the Golfo San Jorge Basin by Rub√©n Dario Mart√≠nez and Fernando Emilio Novas in 2006;Mart√≠nez, R.D., and Novas, F.E. (2006). \\"Aniksosaurus darwini gen. et sp. nov., a new coelurosaurian theropod from the early Late Cretaceous of central Patagonia, Argentina.\\" Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, n.s. 8(2): 243-259. the name was first coined in 1995 and reported in the literature in 1997. The specific epithet honors Charles Darwin who visited Patagonia in 1832/1833 during the Voyage of the Beagle. Description The type specimen MDT-PV 1/48, discovered in the Bajo Barreal Formation, consists of an articulated right hindlimb, which includes the femur, fibula, tibia and foot. The longest femur discovered for this genus measures 247mm, and the longest tibia, 270mm. On average, the tibia is 13% longer than the femur in Aniksosaurus, an adaptation which has been strongly correlated with the development of cursorial habits in dinosaurs. Martinez and Novas (2006), based on femoral measurements, originally suggested that Aniksosaurus darwini was approximately long and tall at the hip, and weighed up to . However, recent estimates suggest a total body length between and and a body weight between and . In a 2013 study by Ibiricu et al., it was concluded that the holotype and four more individuals referable to Aniksosaurus, were juvenile to sub- adult individuals as shown by a histological analysis. The two individuals analyzed had histological characteristics that suggested an approximate age of three. The morphological evidence supporting ontogenetic immaturity was as follows: (a) the absence of an outer circumferential layer; (b) the absence of secondary (Haversian) osteons; (c) the presence of only a few growth cycles; and (d) the thickness of the zones. Classification Histology of Aniksosaurus tibiae Mart√≠nez and Novas (2006) originally assigned this genus to the clade Coelurosauria based on anatomical features present in the hindlimbs. The paleontologists describe Aniksosaurus as \\"more derived than some basal coelurosaurians such as compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and coelurids\\", but less advanced than later coelurosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus and Oviraptor. Aniksosaurus exhibits some of the derived features found in Coelurosauria, such as (a) the ilium has a well developed cuppedicus fossa; (b) the femur possesses an anterior trochanter that is proximally projected, almost reaching the level of the articular head; (c) the greater trochanter is craniocaudally expanded; (d) the femoral head is rectangular-shaped in cranial aspect; (e) and the fibular shaft is craniocaudally narrow. However more recent research by Choiniere et al. (2010) demonstrated that phylogenetically, Aniksosaurus was closer to individuals in the taxon Compsognathidae. =Distinguishing anatomical features= A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Mart√≠nez and Novas (2006), Aniksosaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: * cranial cervical vertebrae have dorsoventrally deep neural arches, and are provided with a pair of cavities at their cranial surfaces * the neural canal is wide * cranial caudals feature a ventral sagittal keel, and their transverse processes are triangular-shaped in dorsal view * manual ungual phalanges are robust * the metatarsal and digit IV of the pes are transversely narrow * ilium with an extremely expanded brevis shelf (a bone surface on the ilium that functions as an attachment site for tail muscles) * the femur possesses a deep notch for the M. iliotrochantericus Paleobiology Monospecific bonebeds suggest it was gregarious, and that this behavior gave Aniksosaurus a selective advantage over competitors in its paleoenvironment. The hypothesis suggesting gregarious (social) behavior is supported by the taphonomic association of individuals from the Bajo Barreal Formation and evidence garnered from analysis of its bone histology. The authors of this study, Ibiricu, Mart√≠nez, Casal and Cerda (2013) noted that this particular assemblage is only the second known body fossil association of small, coelurosaurian theropods discovered in South America. The theropod taxa have been interpreted as gregarious are Coelophysis bauri,Colbert EH (1989) The Triassic dinosaur Coelophysis. Bulletin of the Museum of Northern Arizona 57: 1‚Äì160.

Aniksosaurus is likely to have exhibited gregariousness only during a specific interval of its life, most likely when it was a sub- adult. Paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= Quarry map of the Bajo Barreal site The remains of the type specimen MDT-PV 1/48 were discovered in the Laguna Palacios Ranch locality in the lower Bajo Barreal Formation of Patagonia in Chubut, Argentina. The specimen was collected by Mart√≠nez in 1995 in green sandstone that was deposited between the Cenomanian stage and the Turonian stage of the Cretaceous period, between 96-91 million years ago, as shown by radiometric Ar-Ar dating. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Museo Regional Desiderio Torres - in Sarmiento, Chubut, Argentina. Remains of at least four more individuals, in 2006 assigned as the paratypes, were uncovered at the site. =Fauna and habitat= Dinosaur remains from this formation include those of the abelisaurid theropod Xenotarsosaurus bonapartei, the sauropods Drusilasaura, Epachthosaurus and Campylodoniscus, the hadrosaur Secernosaurus as well as indeterminate teeth belonging to carcharodontosaurids and dromaeosaurids. Taphonomy The nature of the lithology at the Aniksosaurus site suggests that the deposits were made by a low-energy, unidirectional, overbank fluvial floodplain deposit, which was produced by a lateral migrating fluvial channel. The observation that sandstone tabular bodies were deposited with coarse sandstones and tuff interclasts also supports that Aniksosaurus was preserved in a fluvial environment. The soft tissue underwent subaerial weathering and then began to decompose, from the contributory action of small vertebrae scavengers as evidenced by a series of small grooves in one of the femora recovered, which was then followed by the partial disarticulation of the skeleton. Disarticulation was followed by reorientation of the remains by fluvial currents, which was then followed by differential burial in what appears to have been at least two stages of sedimentation. No evidence was found to support either cannibalism or intra-specific competition.  References   External links  * Mickey Mortimer and Josh B. Smith on the genus.

Bates played three seasons with the Chicago Bears (1999-2001) and two with the Minnesota Vikings (2002-2003). Bates is best known for his achievements as a collegiate player at Northwestern University where he played for Big Ten Championship teams in 1995 and 1996. Bates was a two-time First-Team All-Big Ten performer (1996 and 1998) and still holds a majority of the NU season and career receiving records. He is currently the athletic director at Glenbard East High School in Lombard, Illinois.  Early life  D'Wayne Bates was raised on a farm by a single mother in Jackson, South Carolina. He attended Silver Bluff High School where he was a highly touted, two-sport athlete in high school, excelling in baseball and football. As an outfielder, Bates was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays organization in the 53rd round of the June 1994 Major League Baseball draft.Baseball Reference-1994 Toronto Blue Jays Draft On the gridiron, Bates was an option quarterback (and free safety on defense) and was a teammate of former NFL strong safety Corey Chavous.

He has been leader of the Party of Italian Communists.  Early life  Oliviero Diliberto was born in a family of public servants (his father Marco was employed as attorney in the Administration of the Region of Sardinia, his mother Lella was a teacher). His youth is scarred by the untimely death of his father in 1971, after which he had to be a fatherly role for his younger siblings: his sister Ludovica, then eight years old, and his brother Alessio, who was born just two months before. Diliberto becomes involved with politics in 1969 at age 13, when he was in high school. It is a time of turmoil in Italian schools, and young Oliviero quickly rises through the ranks of the student movement during his University studies. He eventually becomes Secretary of the FGCI (Federation of Young Italian Communists, the youth organisation of the PCI) for the province of Cagliari in 1978, the same year of his graduation. Fascinated by the philosophic thought of Michel Foucault, after graduating from high school he traveled for Paris where, to support himself, he briefly worked at the city morgue, preparing corpses that had to undergo autopsy. From 1978 to 1986 he earns scholarships to further his law studies in Frankfurt and in Rome, then he works as researcher in the University of Cagliari, where later he will reach the post of Professor of Roman Law. Political career A former member of the Italian Communist Party, Diliberto joined the Communist Refoundation Party after the breakup of his former party. First elected as MP in 1994 for the Communist Refoundation Party, Diliberto left his party in 1998 in contrast with the leadership's line about a motion of no confidence in which Romano Prodi was defeated. So Diliberto, together with Armando Cossutta and others, founded the Party of Italian Communists, of which he became the secretary. Diliberto then served as Minister of Justice in the first government of Massimo D'Alema, becoming one of the only two party members which were part of that government. He maintained the position until 2000, leaving voluntarily in the reshuffle, in order to concentrate on the party. On taking office as Minister of Justice, he declared to the press his pride in being \\"The second Communist appointed as Minister of Justice after Palmiro Togliatti\\", and made a point of having the same desk previously used by the postwar Communist leader restored and placed in his office at the Ministry. On November 2004 he was widely criticized for meeting with the leader of Hizbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, during a visit to Lebanon. This prompted a protest note to the Italian Government from the Israeli Ambassador in Rome. Before the April 2006 general election held in Italy (and won by the centre-left coalition), he declared he would not serve as minister in case of a centre-left win, and instead he would maintain his place as party leader, and so he has. In May 2006 he was elected to the City Council of Rome. He is currently professor of Roman Law at the Faculty of Law of the \\"La Sapienza\\" University of Rome. Before the April 2008 snap general election (caused by the fall of the Prodi II Cabinet), Diliberto refused candidacy to the Camera dei Deputati in the Torino constituency for the left- wing alliance The Left ‚Äì The Rainbow, which his party was participating to, on grounds of giving a chance to be elected to a junior party fellow - a steel worker in the local Thyssen-Krupp steelworks, where a fire on 6 December 2007 had killed seven colleagues. After the disastrous results of both the 2008 general elections and of the 2009 European election, where the Italian left- wing parties failed to reach the minimum threshold, Diliberto has been confirmed as party secretary, with a mandate to pursue unity of the left wing parties.  Family  Oliviero Diliberto has been married twice: in 1985 he married Ms. Delia Cardia, from which he separated after some years. He is currently married (since 1997) to Ms. Gabriella Serrenti with whom he met in 1978 at the University where he was assistant lecturer.

The main language spoken in the community is Kunwinjku (aka Bininj Gun-Wok). At the 2016 Australian census, Gunbalanya had a population of 1,116. Only accessible by air in the wet season, Gunbalanya is known for its Aboriginal art, in particular rock art and bark painting. It has a range of services, including a police station, school and community arts centre, Injalak Arts. It is the nearest town to the Awunbarna, also known as Mount Borradaile, an Aboriginal sacred site and the location of significant Indigenous Australian rock art. Etymology and history The area now known as Gunbalanya was originally called \\"Uwunbarlany\\" by Erre-speaking people, who were its original inhabitants. Oenpelli was the way Paddy Cahill (1863‚Äì1923), the founder of the original cattle station in the area, pronounced the local word. The present toponym is an anglisation of the word Kunbarlanja current in Kunwinjku, the language of the people who now live there, who began moving into the area from the east following the Cahill's establishment of his cattle station there in 1909. Oenpelli, as it was known then, was established by the Rev. Alfred Dyer as a mission in 1925 by the Church of England's Church Missionary Society, on the former cattle station. Dyer and his wife Mary established a typical mission station, with church, school, dispensary, garden and store, to which they added pastoral work with feral cattle and horses. Among those who attended the mission school was the celebrated Gagudju elder and interpreter of culture, Bill Neidjie. Oenpelli remained a mission until 1975, when responsibility was transferred to an Aboriginal town council and the name was changed to Gunbalanya. The 1948 American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land visited Oenpelli for three months and collected a large array of local artefacts, art, and specimens. =Use of the name Oenpelli= The large and uncommon Oenpelli python, Morelia oenpelliensis, shares the historic name of this community,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Oenpelli\\", p. 193). as does Oenpelli bloodwood, Corymbia dunlopiana. A geological event known as the Oenpelli Dolerite intrusive event occurred about 1,720 million years ago. People and surrounds The local people speak Kunwinjku (aka Bininj Gun- Wok), and are a grouping of the Bininj peoples. At the 2016 Australian census, Gunbalanya had a population of 1,116. 88.6% of the population identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Gunbalanya is the largest town in the area and the nearest population centre to Awunbarna, also known as Mount Borradaile, a mountain about above sea level about away. Awunbarna is a sacred site and the location of a significant number of rock paintings. A study published in 2020 recording the Maliwawa Figures describes paintings at 87 sites across western Arnhem Land from Awunbarna westwards to the Wellington Range. Access, facilities and tourism Injalak Hill The sealed Arnhem Highway links Darwin to Jabiru, the town within Kakadu National Park. About before Jabiru, the sealed road turns off to Ubirr, the Border Store, Cahill's Crossing on the East Alligator River and Oenpelli. The road is dirt from the East Alligator to just before Gunbalanya, a distance of about . While this road is generally navigable by four-wheel drive vehicle, the river crossing is a causeway which is closed by flooding during the wet season (November to April) and at high tides. Dry season travellers are able to drive the from Darwin in about three hours and from Jabiru in under an hour. Northern Land Council permits are required to cross the East Alligator River, the western boundary of Arnhem Land, and travel east to Gunbalanya, obtainable from offices in Darwin or Jabiru. These may take up to two weeks to finalise, and many visitors prefer to see Arnhem Land through an organised tour operation. Oenpelli Airport is a sealed all weather airstrip located in Gunbalanya, and a number of companies offer charter flights to and from this airport. The town is regarded as one of the major Aboriginal towns in Arnhem Land, and includes a school (pre-school to Year 12), health clinic, service station, police station, aged care, recrational clubs, community arts centre (Injalak Arts) and various stores. The Stone Country Festival (formerly Gunbalanya Cultural Open Day) is usually held in August and access for this is allowed without permit. Though an annual event, it is sometimes not able to be organised in a given year. The local radio station is called \\"RIBS\\" for Remote Indigenous Broadcasting Service. Indigenous art Wooden skull painted with clan designs, from Gunbalanya =Rock art= Western Arnhem Land is home to some of the most significant rock art in the world. Local artistic traditions are continued and adapted by the Injalak Arts Centre. Injalak Arts is named after nearby Injalak Hill, which has many rock art galleries and is the main tourist attraction in Gunbalanya. =Bark painting= In the 1960s the mission at Oenpelli encouraged traditional rock painting artists to paint on bark. These painted barks were sold to anthropologists and travellers. This soon became a cottage industry, and several important Aboriginal artists, including Lofty Bardayal, Mick Kubarrku and Dick Murramurra transferred their rock art skills to bark.

Known only by a chance remark of the 9th- century Byzantine grammarian Theognostus (De orthographia), archaeology of the site shows Dreros to have been initially colonised by mainland Greeks in the early Archaic Period about the same time as Lato and Prinias. Archaeology The early Iron Age site, first excavated in 1917, was most prosperous in the 8th-6th centuries BC; later it became a minor satellite of Knossos and continued to be occupied into the Byzantine period. It comprises two acropoleis with an Archaic-period agora between them. Almost the whole of the city and its necropolis have been excavated, confirming that this is a post- Minoan Greek habitation; its inscriptions are in Dorian dialect. Traces of fortifications have been discovered. There is also a large communal cistern dug between the late 3rd and early 2nd century BC, which contained Archaic inscriptions, one of which, famous as the Dreros inscription,BCH 1937:333/8Early Greek Law By Michael Gagarin Pages 81-86 the \\"sacred law of Dreros\\", is the earliest complete record of constitutional law found in Greece, which mentions the Dorian Cretan titles kosmos and damios. In Hellenistic times, Dreros declined in importance to the extent that it was not included among the thirty Cretan cities that signed a pact with the Attalid king of Pergamum, Eumenes II, in 183 BC. The site has little to offer to the casual tourist. =Temple of Apollo Delphinios= South of the agora is one of the earliest free-standing Greek temples; it dates from the Geometric period (ca 750s BC). The Delphinion, as it is called, was dedicated to Apollo Delphinios. It was excavated in 1935 by Spyridon Marinatos, who published it. Three statuettes made of bronze sheets hammered over moulding cores (sphyrelaton) \\"in the early orientalizing style of the late eighth century\\" (Boardman) were found in the precincts of the Temple of Apollo Delphinios; they are now at the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion. They probably depict Apollo and Artemis and their mother Leto and together are known as the \\"Dreros Triad.\\" =Eteocretan inscriptions= Two Eteocretan inscriptions on blocks of grey schist were excavated in 1936 by Pierre Demargne and Henri van Effenterre from the western part of the large cistern mentioned above.Henri van Effenterre, Revue de Philologie, 3 serie, Volume XX, Fascicolo II, 1946 (Paris) These inscriptions were housed in the museum at Neapolis, but were lost during the Germano-Italian occupation of Crete during World War II.

Stamford (lyrics). The song was performed as a music hall routine by William J. \\"Billy\\" Ashcroft. It has been recorded by a number of artists, most notably Bing Crosby. The song is associated with Ireland and often performed on St. Patrick's Day in the United States. Background Stamford, the composer of the song, was the manager of the Alhambra Theatre in Belfast and the song was written expressly for the theatre's owner, the Irish-American music hall veteran Billy Ashcroft. Ashcroft, often referred to as \\"The Solid Man\\" for his association with the Edward Harrigan song \\"Muldoon, the Solid Man,\\" had earlier in his career in the U.S. performed a blackface routine called \\"The Lively (or 'Musical') Moke,\\" which interspersed comic song and dance with brief performances on multiple instruments. \\"McNamara's Band\\" gave him scope for a similar Irish \\"character song.\\"The \\"City Summary,\\" New York Clipper, December 17, 1870, p. 294 reported Ashcroft's act at the Globe Theater: \\"Wm. Ashcroft, the original performer of the song and dance entitled 'The Lively Moke,' in his performance of it introduced a great variety of dances, and played with real proficiency upon a large number of musical instruments.\\" Ashcroft's claim to have originated the routine was challenged by another variety artist, Johnny Thompson, who performed the \\"Moke\\" act for decades. Irish music hall historians Watters and Murtagh described Ashcroft's performance of the routine: \\"Here 'McNamara' breaks into a dancing quick-step March up and down the Stage, his nimble fingers snatching up one instrument after another, blowing the bassoon, tootling the flute, beating the drum with the knob of his baton - A One-Man Band.\\" Eugene Watters and Matthew Murtagh, Infinite Variety: Dan Lowrey's Music Hall, 1879-97, Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1973 Modern listeners associate the song with the version recorded on December 6, 1945 by Bing Crosby, with a set of lyrics credited to \\"The Three Jesters.\\" Released on Decca Records in early 1946, the song became a Top Ten hit for Crosby. It remains one of his most popular songs and is often performed on St. Patrick's Day in the United States. A slightly earlier recording of this song appeared in the 1945 film The Way to the Stars. Stanley Holloway leads the crowd in a pub close to a Royal Air Force base during World War II. It has been claimed that the song was inspired by an actual band, the St Mary's Fife and Drum Band, formed in Limerick in 1885. In the late 19th century the band featured four brothers, Patrick, John, Michael and Thomas McNamara, and became famous for playing shows all across Ireland. In the early 20th century Patrick and Thomas emigrated to the United States and formed the \\"McNamara's Band\\" with Patrick \\"Patsy\\" Salmon, another Limerick emigre. After Salmon left the group Patrick and Thomas formed \\"McNamara's Trio\\" with Thomas on piccolo, Patrick on violin and Patrick's daughter, Eileen, on the piano. The trio recorded and released several songs for Vocalion Records.limerickslife.com/st-Mary's-band/ John McNamara served with the Royal Munster Fusiliers during the Second Boer War and First World War. He was killed in action on 9 May 1915, and his body was never recovered after the war; his name is today commemorated on the Le Touret Memorial, France. Lyrics The most widely used set of lyrics is the adaptation by Crosby's \\"Three Jesters\\" (Red Latham, Wamp Carlson and Guy Bonham). =Original lyrics= My name is McNamara, I'm the Leader of the Band, And tho' we're small in number we're the best in all the land. Oh! I am the Conductor, and we often have to play With all the best musicianers you hear about to-day. :(Chorus) :When the drums go bang, the cymbals clang, the horns will blaze away, :MacCarthy puffs the ould bassoon while Doyle the pipes will play; :Oh! Hennessy Tennessy tootles the flute, my word 'tis something grand, :Oh! a credit to Ould Ireland, boys, is McNamara's Band! Whenever an election's on, we play on either side- The way we play our fine ould airs fills Irish hearts with pride. Oh! if poor Tom Moore was living now, he'd make yez understand That none could do him justice like ould McNamara's Band. :(Chorus) We play at wakes and weddings, and at every county ball, And at any great man's funeral we play the \\"Dead March in Saul,\\" When the Prince of Wales to Ireland came, he shook me by the hand, And said he'd never heard the like of \\"McNamara's Band.\\" =Three Jester's version= The Three Jesters' version is different: The politics of \\"Ould Ireland\\" are removed; the words are made more \\"Irish,\\" e.g. \\"Me name is...\\" rather than \\"My name is...;\\" and stereotypes are added in the final lines to make the selection essentially a comedy song. Oh!, me name is McNamara. I'm the Leader of the Band. Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land. We play at wakes and weddin's, and at every fancy ball, And when we play the funerals we play the march from \\"Saul.\\" :(Chorus) :Oh! the drums go bang, and the cymbals clang, and the horns they blaze away. :McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play. :And Hennessey Tennessey tootles the flute, and the music is somethin' grand. :A credit to old Ireland is McNamara's Band! Right now we are rehearsin' for a very swell affair, The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there. When General Grant to Ireland came, he took me by the hand, Says he, \\"I never saw the likes of McNamara's Band.\\" :(Chorus) Oh my name is Uncle Yulius and from Sweden I did come, To play with McNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum. And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand, They shout \\"There's Uncle Yulius playing with an Irish band.\\" :(no chorus here) Oh! I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green, And I am the funniest looking Swede that you have ever seen. There is O'Briens and Ryans and Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland, But by Yimminy, I'm the only Swede in McNamara's Band. =Others= The English Premier League football team Tottenham Hotspur F.C. adopted the song as their club anthem, with one verse changed: Oh the whistle blows the cockerel crows, and now we're in the game, It's up to you, you Lilywhites, to play the Tottenham way. Oh there's many a team from many a town and some are great and small, But the famous Tottenham Hotspur are the greatest of them all. In popular culture *\\"MacNamara's Band\\" (note correct spelling) is a club song for Tottenham Hotspur F.C. a Premier League Football Club in North London. The connection to the club may be that the song was written in Barnet, also North London and not far from the Spurs Ground. Spurs is the well known nickname for Tottenham Hotspur. The song was adopted by Spurs long before popular legend cites its adoption after Northern Irish international Danny Blanchflower joined the club in 1954. Whilst the song was used at this time and underwent something of a revival during the Glory Glory years of the early 1960s, its use at White Hart Lane predates either. It was played at the beginning of every Tottenham home game for over 30 years, and is still used as the players return to the pitch at the start of the second half. : It has been suggested by older Spurs supporters, and in some books, that it was because Spurs had a Manager, Peter McWilliam (1912‚Äì27 & 1938‚Äì42) and that this is the reason McNamaras Band (Macs band) was adopted. Whatever the origin many fans will remember the tingle of excitement when the music started to play as the captain appeared coming up the steps of the old West Stand that led to the pitch, always exactly as the music started. The last player out of the dressing room pressed a button on the wall of the passage which rang a bell which in turn prompted the tape to be played. *The melody is used in Harold Baum's \\"The Pentose Phosphate Shunt\\" in The Biochemists' Songbook. *\\"McNamara's Band\\" is a nickname for fans of Syracuse University basketball star Gerry McNamara. *In addition, the song was part of a sing-a-long in the Famous Studios animated short, The Emerald Isle (1949).

He is the leader of Union of Democrats for Europe, a minor centrist Italian party. He was Minister of Labour in the Berlusconi government from 10 May 1994 to 17 January 1995, and Minister of Justice in the Prodi government from 17 May 2006 to 17 January 2008. In addition Mastella is also mayor of his native town, Ceppaloni. He was elected to the European Parliament in June 2009 on the list of The People of Freedom of Berlusconi. Political career Mastella was born in Ceppaloni, province of Benevento. A former long-time member of the Christian Democracy party and Member of Parliament since 1976, after the break-up of his party in 1994 Mastella founded a new party, called Centro Cristiano Democratico, together with Pierferdinando Casini. After the victory of Silvio Berlusconi in the 1994 elections, he was successively appointed as Minister of Labour. In 1998, after the fall of Romano Prodi's first government, Mastella decided to follow Francesco Cossiga, lifetime senator and former Italian Republic President. He left his party to found the Christian Democrats for the Republic, then Democratic Union for the Republic. This new political party, which supported the new centre-left government led by Massimo D'Alema, lasted only one year however; in 1999, Mastella took over the leadership of UDEUR. In 2005, Mastella decided to take part in the primary election for the leadership of The Union. He obtained 4.6% of the votes. Clemente Mastella and the President of the Sicilian Region Salvatore Cuffaro were involved in a scandal when it was found that they had been the best men of Francesco Campanella, a former member of the Mafia that helped the boss Bernardo Provenzano during his absconding. In July 2000, Mastella was a witness at Campanella's wedding.Italian justice minister linked to mafia inquiry, The Guardian, 18 May 2006. In 2016 he became mayor of the city of Benevento. Minister of Justice In 2006, Mastella became minister of Justice in the Prodi government. Mastella promoted a general amnesty in 2006. He also proposed criminalising Holocaust denial, but he dropped the proposal after opposition by historians and concerns about such law being unconstitutional. As Minister of Justice, Mastella received an \\"Advice of Judicial Proceedings\\" in February 2007 from the Naples prosecutors‚Äô office. He is being investigated for fraudulent bankruptcy when the Naples football club S.S.C. Napoli collapsed in 2004. Mastella was vice president of the Board of Directors. In September 2007 he has asked the Higher Council of the Magistracy to arrange the transfer of the prosecuting attorney of Catanzaro Luigi De Magistris, who was inquiring on a committee of illegal transactions composed by politicians (including Mastella himself) and magistrates. In May 2007, Mastella opened a blog of his own (clementemastella.blogspot.com) in retaliation to criticism by the Italian comedian and political activist Beppe Grillo. Mastella's wife, Sandra Lonardo, is also a UDEUR politician, and she acts as president of the Regional Council of Campania. She has been under house arrest for suspected bribery since 16 January 2008. Domiciliari alla moglie di Mastella, La Repubblica, 16 January 2008. Meanwhile, Clemente Mastella resigned from his position as Justice Minister; Mastella: 'Caccia all'uomo, mi dimetto', La Repubblica, 16 January 2008. in announcing his resignation, he said that \\"between the love of my family and power I choose the former\\" and expressed his desire to be \\"more free from a political and personal point of view\\". Prodi rejected the resignation,\\"Italian justice minister resigns\\", BBC News, 16 January 2008. but on 17 January Mastella said again that he was resigning. Prodi was to temporarily take over his portfolio.\\"Italian PM to temporarily take over justice minister's portfolio\\", Xinhua, 17 January 2008. =2008 Italian political crisis= Despite having earlier said that he would support Prodi's government without participating in it, on 21 January 2008, Mastella said that his party was ending its support, thereby depriving the government of its narrow majority in the Senate. Mastella said that UDEUR wanted an early election and that it would vote against the government if there was a vote of confidence.\\"Mastella to Drop Support for Prodi, Favors Elections (Update1)\\", Bloomberg, 21 January 2008.\\"Italy PM in cabinet crisis talks\\", BBC News, 21 January 2008. Mastella's decision occurred a few days after a decision by the Constitutional Court which confirmed that there would be a referendum to modify the electoral system.\\"Italian court okays referendum on election law\\", Reuters, 1 January 2008. As stated many times by Mastella, if the referendum was confirmed this would lead directly to the fall of the government\\"Legge elettorale, Mastella minaccia la crisi\\", Corriere della Sera, 10 April 2007.\\"Mastella: Se c'√® referendum si rischia la crisi di governo\\" La Stampa, 10 April 2007. and in fact this is what happened. The fall of the government disrupted a pending election-law referendum that, if it had been passed, would have made it harder for small parties like Mastella's to gain seats in parliament.\\"Prodi Likely to Quit, Prompt Vote or Election Reform\\" Bloomberg, 24 January 2008. On 6 February 2008, Mastella announced that he would be part of Silvio Berlusconi's Casa delle Libert√†.

Berlusconi chiude con Mastella, La Repubblica, 1 March 2008. After failing to secure a coalition with any other political party, Mastella decided to quit the electoral competition on 7 March, as the Italian electoral system subjects political parties not a part of a coalition to thresholds of 4% and 8% for the Chamber and the Senate, respectively.

Biography Reid was raised in Sacramento, California, where he played the trumpet through junior high and high school. Upon graduation from Sacramento High School, he entered the United States Air Force as a trumpet player. During that period he began to be seriously interested in the bass. After fulfilling his duties in the military, Rufus had decided he wanted to pursue a career as a professional bassist. He moved to Seattle, Washington, where he began serious study with James Harnett of the Seattle Symphony. He continued his education at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied with Warren Benfield and principal bassist, Joseph Guastefeste, both of the Chicago Symphony. He graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Music Degree as a Performance Major on the Double Bass. Rufus Reid's major professional career began in Chicago and continues since 1976 in New York City. Playing with hundreds of the world's greatest musicians, he is famously the bassist that saxophonist Dexter Gordon chose when he returned to the states from his decade-long exile in Denmark. His colleagues include Thad Jones, Nancy Wilson, Eddie Harris, and Bob Berg.

The most famous of these was John Smedley (1803‚Äì1874), born Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Lea Mills Lea Mills was founded in 1784 by Peter Nightingale (a relation of Florence Nightingale and former accountant to Richard Arkwright) and John Smedley (father of the better-known son of the same name). It was set up on a hilly site straddling a brook at Lea Bridge, just outside Matlock. The brook was used to both clean yarn and power machinery. The mill specialised in the production of muslin and spinning cotton to send out to local cottages with hand frame looms. Towards the end of the 18th century, the company had extended its activities to include knitting and hosiery manufacture ‚Äì said to be the origin of Long Johns. By this time, John Smedley was running the business alone, although the Nightingale family retained an interest in the property. As Lea Mills remains open and an operational building to this day, manufacturing the company's range of designer knitwear, John Smedley claims to be world's longest running factory manufacturer. John Smedley 1803‚Äì1874 John and Caroline Smedley in their book on hydropathy. Credit: Wellcome Library John Smedley's son, also named John Smedley, was born on 12 June 1803. In 1819 the younger John Smedley began work as an apprentice. In 1825 he took over the running of the mill, and started an energetic expansion of its operations. The mill at this time had already diversified from cotton to wool, and from simply weaving to knitting. Smedley the younger's plan was to produce a wide range of finished garments, rather than simply manufacture cloth. In 1847 he married Caroline Harward, the second daughter of John Harward the Vicar of Wirksworth. Smedley's success and growing wealth enabled other grand projects. He developed an interest in hydrotherapy, and built Smedley's Hydro in Matlock, a spa resort that attracted patrons from around the world. As a family home he also built the massive and ostentatious Riber Castle on a hilltop overlooking Matlock. This is now one of Derbyshire's most famous landmarks. Smedley died on 27 July 1874,. See downloadable attachments at bottom of page. and upon his death the business passed to his cousin, John T Marsden Smedley, and thence to John B Marsden Smedley. In 1893 the operation became a limited company. Brand names The designer label John Smedley is now familiar in boutiques, department stores and classic retailers around the world. The company sells to over 30 countries and has won numerous awards for its export achievements. The largest export market is Japan. There are concessions in some branches of Flannels and Fenwick.

They are nomadic hunter-gatherers with seasonal nomadic patterns and practice small-scale shifting horticulture.Mondrag√≥n, H√©ctor 1994 \\"La defensa del territorio Nukak\\" en Antropolog√≠a y derechos Humanos.

[This appears to be a translated press release from Survival.] Part of their territory has been used by coca growers, ranchers, and other settlers, as well as being occupied by guerrillas, army and paramilitaries. Responses to this crisis include protests, requests for assimilation, and the suicide of leader Maw-be'. An estimated 210‚Äì250 Nukak people live in provisional settlements at San Jos√© del Guaviare, while about as many live nomadically in the Nukak Reservation (Resguardo).  Hunting  Nukak are expert hunters. The men hunt with blowguns that shoot darts coated with curare \\"manyi\\", a poison made from different plants (curares). They hunt, in particular, several species of monkeys (Alouatta spp., Cebus spp., Saimiri sp., Lagothrix spp., Ateles sp., Saguinus spp., Callicebus torquatus), and birds (Muscovy duck, chachalacas, guans, curassows, grey-winged trumpeter and toucans). They also use javelins made out of Socratea exorrhiza palm wood to hunt two species of peccaries (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) and spectacled caimans, whose eggs they consume. Nukak neither hunt nor eat brocket deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris); they consider these animals to share a common ancestor with humans.Cabrera, Gabriel; Carlos FRANKY y Dany Mahecha 1999: Los N…®kak: n√≥madas de la Amazonia colombiana. Bogot√° D.C.: Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Politis, Gustavo 1996: Nukak. Bogot√° D.C.: Instituto Amaz√≥nico de Investigaciones SINCHI The Nukak also capture rodents (Cuniculus sp., Dasyprocta spp.), armadillos (Dasypus sp.), tortoises (Geochelone sp), frogs (in large quantities), crabs, shrimps, snails, larvae of palm weevils (mojojoy, \\"mun\\", Rhynchophorus spp.) and larvae of several species of wasps and caterpillars.  Fishing  The Nukak eat several species of fish, like Hoplias sp., Myloplus spp., Mylossoma spp., Hydrolycus sp., Cichla sp., surub√≠ (Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum), catfishes (Brachyplatystoma spp.), piranhas (Serrasalmus spp., Pygocentrus spp.) and river rays (Potamotrygon sp.). Fishing is partly done with cord and metal fish hooks, although the Nukak still catch their fish traditionally with bow and arrow or harpoons, traps, or baskets (\\"mei\\", water cages). They also use a sophisticated technique that has been reported in several cultures: it uses nu√∫n, the root of a Lonchocarpus sp. that contains a number of substances that when dissolved in the water streams stun the fish, making them easy to catch.  Gatherering  They collect honey of twenty species of bees and many fruits: palm fruits (Jessenia bataua), Oenocarpus spp., Attalea spp., Mauritia sp., Phenakospermum guyannense, Aechmea sp., Inga sp., Couma macrocarpa, Iryanthera sp., Theobroma spp., Pourouma spp., Parinari sp., Micrandra sp., Helicostylis sp., Caryocar sp., Talisia sp., Hymenaea sp., Dacryodes spp., Abuta sp., Eugenia spp., Touraleia sp., Perebea spp., Protium sp., Cecropia sp., Batocarpus sp., Hyeronimasp., Brosimumsp., Dialiumsp., Garciniasp., Manilkarasp., Naucleopsisspp., Pradosiasp., Pouteriasp., Salasiasp., Passifloraspp., Duroia maguirei, Duroia hirsuta, Mouririsp., and Alibertia sp.Guti√©rrez, Ruth 1996: \\"Manejo de los recursos naturales (fauna y flora) por los Nukak\\"; Bogot√°: Universidad Nacional de Colombia, mec.C√°rdenas, Dairon y Gustavo Politis 2000: Territorios, movilidad, etnobot√°nica y manejo del bosque en los Nukak orientales. Bogot√° D.C.: SINCHI. Nukak take the sweet resin from \\"mupabuat\\" (Lacunal sp.) and the rattan water (Doliocarpus sp.). They cover their encampments (\\"wopyi\\") with leaves of Phenakospermum guyannense and palms, and make their hammocks with fiber of the cumare palm Astrocaryum sp.; moorings with Heteropsis tenuispadix, Eschweilera sp., and Anthurium sp.; blowguns with Iriartella stigera, Bactris maraja; bows with Duguetia quitarensis; axe ends with Aspidosperma sp.; darts with thorns of Oneocarpus sp.; dart quivers with leaves of Calathea sp.; milkweed with Pachira nukakika, Ceiba sp., and Pseudobombax sp.; loinclothes for men with Couratari guianensis; baskets with Heteropsis spp.; disposable bags with Ischnosiphon arouma and Heliconia sp.; soap with Cedrelinga sp.; perfumes with Myroxylon sp. and Justice pectoralis; and diverse objects. They make blades with the teeth of piranha but have also adapted to use metals. Until 1990 they practised small-scale pottery, producing a small kind of pot to take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When they do not have matches or lighters, they use special wood (Pausandra trianae) to produce fire. They no longer make mirrors with the resin of Trattinickia glaziovii or stone axes.  Shifting cultivation  They have crops in their territory, along their routes. They traditionally cultivate for food, tubers such as sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas), taros (Xanthosoma violaceum, Colocasia sp.), yams (Dioscorea sp.), and manioc (Manihot esculenta). Also peach palms (Bactris gasipaes), pineapple (Ananas comosus), chili pepper (Capsicum chinense), and several fruit trees. In all the gardens there are bananas (Musa paradisiaca) and sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum). They also plant to obtain tools for daily life (like bowls of Crescentia cujete and Lagenaria siceraria); or to make dyes. (like \\"achiote\\" Bixa orellana and \\"carayur√∫\\" Arrabidaea chica, in order to paint the body); and a cane (Gynerium sagittatum), to make arrows and harpoons. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is harvested for ritual uses.  Social aspects  Marriage is settled after the man has formally courted the woman with accepted gifts and she has acceded to live with him. In order to look for a pairing, a man must have gone through an initiation ritual in which he endures trials and consumes a hallucinogen (Virola sp.). The most suitable couple is one made up by crossed cousins. Marriage between parallel cousins is forbidden. If the woman still lives in the home of the father, the gifts must include him. If the woman accepts, she settles down in man's encampment; if they have a child then they are considered a formal pair, which establishes mutual relations of kinship, expressed in rights and duties of reciprocity. A man can marry several wives, although a single wife is most common, and examples of three or more are rare. This polygyny coexists with a temporal polyandry during the pregnancy in order to improve the qualities of the baby. Each domestic group is part of a territorial group and other groups that are established to perform specific duties like security measures, according to the different stations and situations. On the other hand, each N√∫k√¢k is considered as part of a paternal lineage, \\"n√ºwayi\\", named after an animal or plant. Ten territorial Nukak groups (\\"w√ºn\\") have been identified, each one with at least 50 or 60 people, who most of the year do not remain together but form different groups for harvesting and/or hunting that are distributed in accordance with the climatic seasonal changes and the security situation. Each group is considered part of one of four regions of its territory. On certain occasions different groups join, where they practice a special ritual, \\"entiwat,\\" in which the groups dance face to face, striking and verbally injuring each other until the ritual reaches a climatic moment in which they all embrace, weeping while they remember their ancestors and express affection. The groups practice a form of exchange, \\"ihinihat\\", especially when all the resources are not in the same territory. It is considered taboo for the Nukak to discuss dead people.  Language  Nukak people speak a tonal language.Hess, Richard; Kennet Conduff y Jan Ellen Conduff 2005: Gram√°tica Pedag√≥gica Provisional del idioma Nukak. Bogot√°: Iglesia Nuevos Horizontes. Mahecha, Dany 2009: \\"El nombre en N…®kak\\"; L. Wetzels (ed.) The linguistics of endangered languages. Contributions to morphology and morpho-syntax. Utrecht: LOT, pp. 63-93.  Endangered people  Nukak populations have lowered from malaria, measles and pulmonary diseases since their contact with the New Tribes Mission and other outsiders beginning in 1981. Today coca growers, left-wing FARC guerillas, right-wing AUC paramilitaries, and the Colombian army have occupied their lands. In 2006, a group of nearly 80 Nukak left the jungle and sought assimilation to preserve their culture. As one of the migrants, Pia-pe, put it: \\"We do want to join the white family, but we do not want to forget words of the Nukak.\\"Juan Forero, \\"Leaving the Wild, and Rather Liking the Change,\\" New York Times, May 11, 2006. In October 2006, leader and Nukak Spanish speaker Maw-be' committed suicide by drinking poison. Friends and the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) reasoned he did so out of desperation in his inability to secure supplies or a safe return for the Nunak to return home.Darcy Crowe, Nomadic tribe struggles in Colombia, Associated Press, October 27, 2006. Niall Ferguson cites them as an example of a hunter-gathering tribe which, hitherto ignorant of a money economy, has been shown to be happy to trade an arduous traditional life in their jungle homelands for government handouts.Niall Ferguson, The Ascent of Money: A Financial history of the world, (2008) Penguin Books, 2009 p.19.

Career in Cuba  Hatch began gymnastics in her native Cuba at the age of four. She won her first Cuban National Championships when she was ten; over the course of her career, she would win the title seven times. Competing for Cuba, Hatch made her debut at the World Gymnastics Championships in 1993 and placed tenth in the all-around. In 1995, she won three medals at the Pan American Games, placing second on the balance beam and third on the vault and uneven bars, as well as fourth in the all-around. The following year, she became the first Cuban gymnast to win a medal at the World Championships, with a bronze on the vault. Hatch qualified to the 1996 Olympics as an individual competitor, but a lack of funding prevented the Cuban Olympic Committee from sending her. She retired in 1997; married an American, Alan Hatch; and moved to the United States. With her husband, she became a part-owner and coach of the Stars Academy gym in West Haven, Connecticut. In 2001, she became an American citizen.  Career in the United States  Hatch resumed training at the elite level in 2001, with her husband as her coach. In mid-2002, she won the U.S. Classic, a qualifier to the National Championships, defeating reigning national champion Tasha Schwikert. She went on to place fourth at Nationals, performing two strong vaults (a double-twisting Tsukahara and a double-twisting Yurchenko) and establishing herself as a contender for a medal at the 2002 World Championships: Muriel Grossfeld, a former national champion who worked with Hatch, called her \\"probably the best vaulter in the world\\". Although Hatch was a U.S. citizen, Olympic rules stated that during the first year after obtaining citizenship in a new nation, an athlete needed permission from her former country of citizenship to represent the new one in international competition. Fidel Castro refused to give Hatch permission to compete for the U.S., prompting American government officials and former President Jimmy Carter to petition Cuba, unsuccessfully, on her behalf. Because Cuba would not release her, Hatch had to wait until 2003 to represent the United States internationally. Hatch won the vault title at the 2003 National Championships and was named to the 2003 World Championships team, but tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the day before the start of the competition. It can take up to six months after ACL reconstruction for an athlete to be able to resume training. However, Hatch was able to return to competition by the middle of 2004, in time for the National Championships and Olympic Trials, and she was named to the U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens. In the team competition at the Olympics, Hatch performed on vault and contributed to the United States' silver medal. Although her ACL was not completely rehabilitated, she still qualified to the vault event final, where she won a silver medal behind Monica Ro»ôu of Romania. She was the first American woman to win an Olympic vault medal since Mary Lou Retton in 1984.  Post-Olympics  After the Olympics, Hatch turned to coaching, while also working in fashion (including developing her own clothing line). In January 2012, she moved to Ashburn, VA where she resides now. Her Annia Cares project organization was launched in 2016 to help and support athletes and families around the world.

It is located on South Quad adjacent to \\"Main Circle\\", across from the law school building. Because of Alumni's central location and boisterous reputation, residents fondly refer to the hall as the \\"Center of the Universe\\". Together with other historic structures of the university, it is on the National Register of Historic Places. History Alumni and Dillon Hall were built as part of an extensive building program that started in the mid 20s and aimed at improving educational and living facilities, and increasing supply of on-campus residential facilities. The two dorms were expected to cost $850,000 and add host 500 students to reduce the housing shortage and increase on-campus students to 2,600. Ground was broken on March 2nd 1931 and construction was contracted to Sollitt and Sons. Funds were collected through the Alumni Association and a $250,000 gift from the General Education Board. An additional $52,000 came from the 1925 Rose Bowl.Dufresne, Chris \\"When they were riding high\\". Los Angeles Times, October 2, 2007 Both halls were designed in 1931 by architects Charles Donagh Maginnis and Timothy Walsh in Collegiate Gothic style. The Maginnis & Walsh was known at the time for its innovative and refined gothic design of churches and campuses in Boston, and was behind the campus architecture of Boston College and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. The architectural style of both Dillon and Alumni was in line with the previous gothic building on campus by Kervick and Fagan such as Morrissey, with local yellow brick with limestone trimmings, adorned with stone carvings on the facade and the interiors. The exterior features carvings of saints and athletes. The hall's unique architecture includes gargoyles up top and stone carvings of everything from Madonna and Child (north side chapel entrance), saints (Sts. Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure in the courtyard), dogs (Clashmore Mike, one of the original mascots of the football team), to Knute Rockne (east side). On the south side of the building, facing South Bend, is a statue by Hungarian artist Eugene Kormendi of a college graduate known as The Graduate or Joe College who is looking towards leaving college for the real world. The hall's chapel is dedicated to St. Charles Borromeo, the patron saint of then-president Fr. Charles L. O'Donnell, CSC. The ornate halls made uo then the southern edge and entrance of campus. Built at a total cost of $375,000, Alumni Hall has 169 single rooms and 20 doubles, in addition to those of the rector and the prefects. The first rector was Rev. Raymond Clancy, C.S.C. When the halls opened in late October of 1931 and two hundred students (who had resided off campus for the beginning of the academic year) moved in, Alumni featured some of the latest technologies of the time, such as electric elevators, extension phones, buzzers, and slots for used razors. Since previous newest residential development of Howard Hall, Morrissey Hall, and Lyons Hall (built in 1924-1927) had previously been known as \\"Gold Coast\\" because of their refined architecture, Alumni and Dillon quickly were dubbed \\"Platinum Coast\\" both because they had improved amenities but also because of the grayer color of the architecture and decoration. The hall was so named in honor of the University's alumni. Initially, a funding drive for a new hall was initiated by the Alumni Association in 1915 for the construction of a hall to be names 'Old Students' Hall' and serve as residence hall and to host alumni returning to campus. This fund was instead first invested in Liberty Bonds in 1917, and then again loaned to the University for other projects. When the project was revived in 1920, issues with the building field prevented construction. Again, in 1922 funds were collected but instead of initiating construction, the Alumni Associated gave more than $60,000 to the University to complete the fund to secure funds from the General Education Board. To honor this continued support of the Alumni Association, the University decided to name the hall 'Alumni Hall' in 1931. The name was chosen as a better sounding version of 'Old Students' Hall'. Additionally, given the shortage of student housing on- campus, the plan to have rooms dedicating to returning alumni was scrapped. The Coat of Arms features two white chevronels on a green field, the colors of the hall, and three dogs, the mascot of the hall. Alumni Hall in the winter During World War II, Dillon and Alumni officers for the V-12 Navy College Training Program. In the 1940s, when Navy trainees took over the residence, Alumni's residents squeezed in with one another, turning all singles into doubles. The space was so cramped that Dave Condon '49, later a sportswriter for the Chicago Tribune, wrote in Scholastic that \\"when someone entered by the front door, it necessitated someone else leaving by the rear egress.\\" Traditions The mascot of alumni hall is the Dawg, in honor of Clashmore Mike, the original Notre Dame mascot donated by Knute Rockne that was subsequently replaced by the Leprechaun. Alumni's close-knit community and tradition for rambunctious behavior likens them to a traditional fraternity; so much so that the dorm is represented by and displays Greek letters. These letters are Delta-Omega-Gamma, which spells out the name of the alumni mascot, a dog (the only time it is not spelled out as \\"Dawg\\"). They display their letters three times a year: during Freshman Orientation (Frosh-O), during Alumni-Dillon Rivalry Week, and during Alumni's secretive Wake Week (shrouded in mystery) in the spring. The Alumni Wake, started in 1983, was inspired by traditional Irish wakes with late night partying. The first Wake involved a handmade wooden coffin, flowers raided from a cemetery trash heap, and a procession. It was intended to be a fancy event, with decorations that turned sections of the dorm into Dublin streets. In subsequent years the Wake became a rowdy and alcohol-infused celebration surrounded by bizarre traditions, one of which involved Rector George Rozum, CSC, ‚Äò61, ‚Äô80MSA, being carried into the hall's dance inside a coffin. The Wake was traditionally held in the basement of Alumni Hall, but with stricter rules from the administration the Wake was moved to other locations around campus. From the original Irish Wake sprang the Wake Week of today, a week shrouded in celebration and mystery. Though the administration has cracked down on the celebration, the Wake retains much of its original spirit and mystery. left Alumni Hall has a long- lasting rivalry with Dillon Hall, with which it shares a courtyard. Though Dillon contains a larger number of inhabitants, Alumni residents refer to Dillon as the \\"little brother\\". In the 1970s and ‚Äò80s, residents were engaged in the \\"Window Wars\\" by throwing and hitting golf balls from the courtyard at Dillon's windows at 3 in the morning after Dillon initiated the conflict. On Fridays of home football weekends, Alumni puts on an activity known as \\"quad dancing\\". At exactly 12:31 p.m., residents charge out of the south quad doors dressed in bizarre costumes. They proceed to dance rambunctiously on South Quad for slightly less than ten minutes, then return inside and continue on with the day.

He was a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation in the Department of Zoology, University College of North Wales (UK), and served as a visiting professor of the Royal Society at the University of Oxford (UK), Rockefeller University of New York (USA), University of Adelaide (Australia) and Institute of Jacques Monod CNRS and Paris University XVII (France). Tarkowski was also a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Sciences, and Academia Europaea. In 1997-2004 he was also a member of the Advisory Board of the Foundation for Polish Science. In 2003 professor Tarkowski retired. Research Pioneering work of Andrzej K. Tarkowski initiated in 1950s formed the basis not only for modern mammalian developmental biology and progress in animal breeding, but also in such techniques as assisted reproduction (in vitro fertilisation) or preimplantational diagnostics. In 1959 Tarkowski showed that a single blastomere isolated from a 2-cell stage mouse embryo is fully able to develop and the result is healthy and fertile mouse (Tarkowski, 1959, Nature). His next achievement was, reported in 1961, birth of first chimaeric mice produced experimentally by injecting blastomeres from one embryo to genetically different embryo (Tarkowski, 1961;Nature). Since then the chimaera has become a useful tool, used in producing genetically modified animals (in this technique genetically engineered stem cells are aggregated with developing embryo. Chimaera obtained this way is phenotypically changed and passes it to the next generation). In 1966 Tarkowski developed a technique which enabled observing chromosome in oocytes, which has been widely used in early studies of embryo (Tarkowski, 1967; Cytogenetics). This publication is often cited, although has been publicised over 50 years ago. In later years professor Tarkowski with his collaborators showed for the first time in history that parthenogenetically activated mouse oocytes are able of developing until mid- gestation (Tarkowski, et al.,1970;Nature). It was a serious argument for the hypothesis of genomic imprinting. Mutually with his Ph.D. student Jacek Kubiak, Tarkowski devised a technique of blastomere electrofusion leading to the generation of tetraploid embryo. Although Professor Tarkowski retired in 2003, he still continued his researches by undertaking new experiments and inventing new techniques. Personal life Professor Tarkowski was passionate about photography. His photographic exhibitions - \\"Botanical impressions\\", \\"Tree and Wood\\", \\"The Earth We Walk On\\" and \\"On the Border of Nature and Abstraction\\" - have been appreciated in many Polish cities. Honours and awards The achievements of Tarkowski have been honored with prestigious scientific awards such as the Albert Brachet Prize of the Royal Academy of Belgium (1980), Polish National Award (1980), the Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation Award (1984), the Embryo Transfer Pioneer Award, the International Embryo Transfer Society Award (1991), and the Commander's Cross with star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2012). He is also a laureate of the Foundation for Polish Science Prize (2013) and the Japan Prize (2002). He has also received a Doctor Honoris Causa degree at the Jagiellonian University (2000) and at the Medical University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (2005). He died on 23 September 2016.

It is played on an n√ón board with n-1 cars for each player‚Äîtwo cars each on a 3√ó3 board is enough for an interesting game, but larger sizes are also possible. Play The board is initially set up with n-1 blue cars along the left edge and n-1 red cars along the bottom edge, the bottom left square remaining empty. Turns alternate: player 1 (\\"Left\\")'s turn is to move any one of the blue cars one space forwards (right) or sideways (up or down). Player 2 (\\"Right\\")'s turn is to move any one of the red cars one space forwards (up) or sideways (left or right). Cars may not move onto occupied spaces. They may leave the board, but only by a forward move. A car which leaves the board is out of the game. There are no captures. A player must always leave his opponent a legal move or else forfeit the game. The winner is the player who first gets all his pieces off the board, or has all his cars blocked in by their opponent. The game can also be played in Misere, where you force your opponent to move their pieces off the board. Theory The 3√ó3 game can be completely analyzed (strongly solved) and is a win for the first player‚Äîa table showing who wins from every possible position is given in Winning Ways, and given this information it is easy to read off a winning strategy. David des Jardins showed in 1996 that the 4√ó4 and 5√ó5 games never end with perfect play‚Äîboth players get stuck shuffling their cars from side to side to prevent the other from winning. He conjectures that this is true for all larger boards. For a 3x3 board, there are 56 reachable positions. Out of the 56 reachable positions, 8 of them are winning, 4 of them are losing, and 44 are draws. References *. *. *. External links *\\"Dodgem\\" . . . any info?

Written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, the film is an adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Its 2017 sequel, Blade Runner 2049, stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Lennie James, Dave Bautista and Jared Leto. Characters in both films = Rick Deckard = Rick Deckard is a \\"blade runner\\", a special agent in the Los Angeles police department employed to hunt down and \\"retire\\" replicants. His ID number is B-263-54, which is stated twice in both the 1992 Director's Cut and the 25th-anniversary Final Cut of the film. He is the protagonist of the film and the narrator in the original theatrical release. Agent Deckard was played by Harrison Ford. = Gaff = Gaff is a Los Angeles police officer who escorts Deckard throughout his mission. He primarily uses \\"Cityspeak\\", a creole of Spanish, French, German, Hungarian, Chinese, and Japanese, which Deckard pretends not to understand. Edit: Gaff speaks Cityspeak to Deckard at the noodle bar at the start of the movie. Although Deckard feigns not understanding, he says of Cityspeak in his narration that \\"I didn't need an interpreter. I knew the lingo. Every good cop did.\\"The Blade Runner FAQ (via Internet Archive) Gaff is never shown participating in Deckard's investigation, preferring to linger in the background crafting origami figures. Gaff was played by American actor/director Edward James Olmos. The sequel novel to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by K. W. Jeter mentions that Gaff is killed in the line of duty. At the beginning of the novel, Bryant has just returned from the funeral and expresses his distaste for the Cityspeak written on Gaff's headstone. In the sequel film, Blade Runner 2049, Gaff is questioned by Officer K (Ryan Gosling) in a retirement home asking about Deckard's whereabouts. = Rachael = Rachael, sometimes referred to as Rachael Tyrell, was the latest experiment of Eldon Tyrell, and the sole Nexus-7 replicant. He believed that since the replicants had such a limited lifespan, they had little time to develop control of their emotions, causing difficulty in managing these emotions. He believed implanting the replicants with memories would create a cushion that would allow for emotional development, and make them more controllable. Rachael has the implanted memories of Lilith Tyrell, Tyrell's niece, and Rachael is then led to believe that she is human. It is not revealed in the film how long she has been living, but Tyrell admits that he thinks she is beginning to suspect the truth of her nature.The name of Tyrell's niece is given as Lilith Tyrell in Blade Runner: Revelations. Tyrell refuses to discuss the issue with Rachael. In desperation, she turns to Deckard, who has been told by Captain Bryant to retire her. However, he falls in love with her instead. At the end of the film, the four replicants Deckard had been assigned to kill are dead. Rachael and Deckard then flee and presumably go into hiding to have a future together. In Blade Runner 2049 it is revealed Rachael, as the sole Nexus-7, was given the ability to reproduce by Tyrell. During an apparently routine investigation, Blade Runner Officer K uncovers a box containing bones and hair buried under a tree. The remains are shown to be that of a being who died after a caesarean section, and upon the discovery that the being was a replicant, K is ordered by Lt. Joshi to track down and kill the replicant's child. K later learns the pregnant replicant was Rachael. After capturing Deckard, Niander Wallace designs a physically near-identical copy of Rachael and offers her to Deckard in an attempt to persuade Deckard to reveal the location of the replicants who helped hide his and Rachael's daughter. After Deckard declines, Wallace has the copy killed. Rachael was played by Sean Young in Blade Runner. In Blade Runner 2049, Rachael was portrayed by actress Loren Peta with Sean Young's facial features de-aged and overlaid via CGI.  Characters in Blade Runner = Roy Batty = Roy Batty is the leader of the renegade Nexus-6 replicants and the main antagonist of the film. He was activated on January 8, 2016, which makes him 3 years and 10 months old by the time of the events of the film. He is highly intelligent, fast and skilled at combat and yet still learning how to deal with emotions. With an A Physical Level (superhuman strength & endurance) and an A Mental Level (genius-level intellect), he is probably the most dangerous of the fugitive replicants. He is a combat model, used off-world for military service. He and five other replicants come to Earth hoping to find a way to lengthen their lifespan. He is able to use J. F. Sebastian to get a meeting with Tyrell, the founder of the company and his creator. Tyrell refers to him as his \\"prodigal son\\" and tells him his life cannot be extended but he should revel in the life that he has, as he has done and seen things others could only dream of. Batty kills Tyrell and Sebastian. Deckard retires the remaining replicants and is hunted by a dying Roy. Deckard ends up dangling from a building and is saved from the fall by Roy. As he dies, Roy tells Deckard about the things he has seen and how the memories will be \\"lost in time, like tears in rain\\". He smiles, saying, \\"Time... to die\\". In the novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, his name was spelled \\"Roy Baty\\" and was the leader of the eight replicants who killed their human owners so that they could escape their life of slavery on Mars. Roy was married to Irmgard Baty, another replicant. In the novel, Roy's relationship with Pris (who was his lover in the film) is only one of friendship. In the novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (written by K. W. Jeter after Dick's death, incorporating elements from Do Androids Dream and Blade Runner script), Batty is one of a series of replicants based on a mercenary of the same name. The template suffered from \\"neural malformation\\", which made them unable to experience fear. This might be a reason why replicants of that series were so difficult to kill; Roy Batty was played by Rutger Hauer. = Harry Bryant = Harry Bryant is the captain of the Rep- Detect department of the Los Angeles Police Department. His job in the film is to deal with a group of escaped Nexus-6 replicants (whom he refers to as \\"skinjobs\\") that have landed on Earth. His top Blade Runner, Holden, was in hospital on a medical ventilator after an encounter with the Leon replicant, earlier in the film. Bryant uses thinly-veiled threats against Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, to enlist his aid. In the original theatrical version, Deckard, during his narration, compares Bryant to the racist cops of the past. \\"Skinjob, that was Bryant's term for Replicants. In history books, he's the kind of cop that used to call black men niggers.\\" Capt. Bryant was played by M. Emmet Walsh. = Hannibal Chew = Hannibal Chew works for the Tyrell Corporation as a genetic engineer. His job is to create the eyes for the replicants, Roy's and Leon's, in this case. In the film, the replicants visit him while he is working in a freezer. The replicants pressure him into telling them that J. F. Sebastian can get them into Tyrell's inner sanctum. He was played by American actor James Hong. = Dave Holden = Dave Holden is the Blade Runner testing new employees at the Tyrell Corporation on the premise that the escaped Replicants might try to infiltrate the company. During a Voight-Kampff test, Leon shoots Holden and leaves him for dead. Later, Bryant mentions that Holden is alive, but his breathing is assisted by machines. There were two hospital scenes with Holden and Deckard that were filmed, but not used in the movie. One scene is shown in the documentary On the Edge of Blade Runner. Both scenes appear in the deleted scenes section on the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD. He was played by Morgan Paull. = Leon Kowalski = Leon Kowalski is a replicant who came to Earth with five others looking to extend their lives. He has an A physical level, which means he has superhuman strength and endurance (according to the Final Cut he was used as a 180 kg/400 lb nuclear-head loader in the outer space colonies as well as a front-line soldier). Leon is classified mental level C. He does not have the speed of thought that Roy does when it comes to solving problems. He was activated on April 10, 2017, making him 2 years and 7 months old by the time of the film. Leon shoots Blade Runner Holden as he administers the Voight-Kampff test on him while he works at the Tyrell Corporation, which he has infiltrated. Leon attacks Deckard after he witnesses Deckard kill Zhora, but is himself killed by Rachael who shoots him with Deckard's gun, which Leon had knocked out of Deckard's hand as he drew it. Leon cherishes photographs of his friends. Unlike Rachael's false photos of her childhood, these include current photos of people who mean something to him. Leon Kowalski was played by Brion James. = Taffey Lewis = Taffey Lewis is the owner of Taffey's Snake Pit Bar. The bar features music, exotic dancing, and something being smoked in pipes. He dismisses Deckard's threats with a free drink. He was played by Hy Pyke. = Pris Stratton = Pris Stratton is a \\"basic pleasure model\\" incepted on Valentine's Day, 2016, making her the second-oldest of the four fugitive replicants at three years, nine months. She is the girlfriend of Roy Batty and is responsible for gaining J. F. Sebastian's trust. At an A-Physical Level, she is shown to have superhuman endurance (as in the scene where she grabs a boiling egg with her bare hand without harm) and an affinity for gymnastics. Her B-Mental Level puts her at a lower intellectual level than Roy, but higher than Leon. She sets a trap for Deckard in the Bradbury Building, disguising herself as one of Sebastian's toys and then attacking Deckard with her gymnastic skills. As she rushes Deckard for another attack, he kills her. Her surname, Stratton, appears in the novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, but is never used in the film. Her punk outfits were inspired by a new wave calendar. It is suggested in Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human that Pris was actually an insane human woman who believed that she was a female replicant, although this has nothing to do with the original Blade Runner since it was from a different author. She was played by Daryl Hannah. = J.F. Sebastian = J.F. Sebastian is a genetic designer working for Tyrell. He is not allowed to emigrate off-world because he has Methuselah Syndrome. Because of this, he ages faster and has a shorter lifespan, something he has in common with the replicants. He is only 25 years old, but his physical appearance is of a middle-aged man. With the Bradbury Building all to himself, he makes the most of his considerable talents creating automata companions. He is loosely based on the character J. R. Isidore from the novel. He is approached by Pris, whom Sebastian takes in because he thinks she is homeless, and Roy comes to stay with him soon after. Roy and Pris point out that because of his condition, Sebastian has much in common with them, and argue that if they don't get Tyrell's help to extend their lives, Pris will soon die. Sebastian is playing correspondence chess with Tyrell, and Roy suggests a bold move which gives rise to an opportunity to visit Tyrell and smuggle Roy in. When Tyrell claims that he cannot extend Roy's life, Roy kills him. Sebastian is seen running away from Roy, who then descends the elevator alone. A police radio message heard by Deckard after Tyrell is killed states that Sebastian's body was also discovered by the police with Tyrell's at the Tyrell Corporation. The makeup for Sebastian was a \\"stretch and stipple\\" technique with no prosthetics. He was played by William Sanderson. = Dr. Eldon Tyrell = Dr. Eldon Tyrell is the CEO and founder of Tyrell Corporation. His creations are Replicants, some of whom have been given away as an incentive for people to emigrate to the Off-World colonies. Others are used in combat to protect those settlers. Roy Batty, along with J. F. Sebastian, finds Tyrell, and asks him to extend his life beyond the four-year limit built into Nexus-6 replicants. However, Tyrell claims this request is impossible to satisfy due to the inherent instabilities of replicant genetics. Upon hearing this, Batty kisses Tyrell before gouging out his eyes and crushing his skull with his bare hands, killing him. He was played by Joe Turkel. = Zhora Salome = Zhora Salome is a replicant with an A Physical Level (super-human endurance) and a B Mental Level (intelligence equal to that of Pris), and has been used in murder squads. She was activated on June 12, 2016, making her 3 years and 5 months old. She gets a job as an exotic dancer at Taffey's Bar, creating an act using her own pet snake. Deckard tracks her down at Taffey's after finding her snake's scale, and she soon realizes that he is dangerous. She attacks him, but Deckard narrowly escapes death when people walk in just before she delivers a killing blow. Zhora tries to escape by running into a busy street, but Deckard chases her and finally shoots her in the back, \\"retiring\\" her. She was played by Joanna Cassidy. = Unnamed replicant(s) = According to dialogue spoken by Bryant in the Final Cut of the film, two other unnamed replicants (only one in earlier versions) were killed while attempting to enter the Tyrell Corporation. The term used by him when describing their deaths (\\"Two of them got fried running through an electrical field\\") suggests they were stopped by an electrical barrier or security device of some sort. (In the theatrical cut of the film, the spoken line is \\"One of them got fried running through an electrical field\\" leaving one replicant unaccounted for.) Earlier drafts of the script name these replicants as Hodge and Mary. In Hampton Fancher's early drafts of the script, Mary lives and Hodge is the only replicant fried in the electrical field. Mary was intended to reflect the novel's character of Irmgard Baty, and was meant to be a \\"mother figure\\" model of replicant, performing housework and childcare duties, and she was supposed to be reminiscent of the stereotypical housewife of the 1950s. Her incept date is given as November 1, 2017. Mary was to be played by Stacey Nelkin, who had originally tried out for the role of Pris, but Mary's scenes were cut before filming. Characters in Blade Runner 2049 = K = KD6-3.7 (\\"K\\" for short) is a Nexus-9 replicant model created to obey and works as a \\"blade runner\\" for the LAPD, hunting down and \\"retiring\\" rogue older model replicants. K is aware he is a replicant, and like the rest of his line, was programmed with implanted memories to aid his mental stability‚Äîthough the new model replicants are fully aware that these fake memories never really happened, to them or other people, but are fictional fabrications. In contrast to Deckard in the first film, a human blade runner who suspects that what he thinks are his real memories might actually be implanted, K is a replicant blade runner, who begins to suspect that his implanted memories are actually real. When he begins to suspect that he may be Rachael's child, and thus a \\"real\\" person, Joi suggests that he needs a real name and picks \\"Joe\\" for him. Officer K was played by Ryan Gosling. = Joi = Joi is an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram, designed and commercially sold by Wallace Corporation to be a fully customizable live-in romantic companion. K, an artificial intelligence himself, has a Joi copy but treats her as a person, and tries to have a real romantic relationship with her, while wondering about how \\"real\\" it can truly be given that she is programmed to like him. K obtains a mobile \\"emanator\\" unit for her at the beginning of the film, a control unit or hologram projector which he can transport in his coat, allowing Joi to accompany him anywhere in the world. Joi is nonetheless intangible and cannot physically interact with her surroundings. Played by Ana de Armas. = Niander Wallace = Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) is the sinister CEO and founder of Wallace Corporation, which dominates replicant production in 2049. A genius genetic engineer, his genetically modified crops and livestock solved a global food crisis ‚Äì which then gave him enough wealth and political clout to lift the ban on replicant production. Wallace bought out the bankrupt Tyrell Corporation (which had collapsed after several revolts by Nexus-8 replicants). Wallace improved the genetic programming of his new \\"Nexus-9\\" replicants to the point that they cannot disobey the orders of humans, even if the order is to commit suicide. By 2049, Wallace Corporation has revitalized the replicant industry and is a major megacorporation with numerous other subsidiaries in other fields, such as Joi unit digital AI holograms. Wallace is blind, but uses cybernetic implants in his neck to interact with various computers and \\"see\\" through flying miniature camera units. The secret of making replicants that can reproduce died with Tyrell, and Wallace is obsessed with learning it. By 2049, Earth is suffering from resource depletion and heavy pollution, and it was Wallace's genetically modified foods and new replicants that not only staved off extinction, but allowed humanity to spread to the off-world colonies. Nonetheless, Wallace is frustrated that humanity has only spread to nine other planets, when he wants to see it explode across thousands of planets in the galaxy. Lacking the capacity to build enough replicants for such an endeavor, Wallace is convinced that replicants capable of reproduction on their own are the answer. = Ana Stelline = Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri) is a scientist who designs the implanted memories that Wallace Corporation installs into its new replicants: the replicants are aware that these memories are implants they did not personally experience, but their presence drastically improves their mental stability. Empathetic to how replicants are used as slave-labor, Ana tries to give them pleasant memories to carry with them, even if they know they're artificial. Due to the complications that can arise, it is forbidden to base memory implants on the real memories of another person: they must be fabrications with no basis in real events. Nonetheless, Dr. Stelline secretly sneaks in a few of her best memories into some of the memory implants, as a gift. Ana actually doesn't directly work for Wallace Corporation: her \\"Stelline Corporation\\" is an independent sub-contractor (Wallace offered to buy her out, but she says she \\"enjoys her creative freedom\\"). Ostensibly, Dr. Stelline developed an immune system deficiency as a child, and has spent the past two decades living in a sterile clean-room in her company's compound, keeping her in seclusion from the outside world. Secretly, Ana is actually the daughter of Deckard and Rachael: living proof that replicants can be capable of reproducing on their own (and making Ana at least part-replicant through her mother). The replicant underground hid her as an infant and scrambled the records, seeing her birth as a miracle and Ana as their savior. K comes to Ana's lab to investigate the wooden horse he found, which was in his allegedly fake memory implant. She confirms that it is a real memory, but not who it is from ‚Äì either K or someone else. The wooden horse was a gift from Deckard to his child, later etched with the child's birth date (the same day that Rachael died, from her grave marker). K suspects the memory of the horse is his own, and he is Rachael's son, but when he meets the replicant underground they reveal that Rachael's child was female. K then realizes that Ana was Rachael's child and it was her memory of the horse ‚Äì because the best memories she gives to replicants like K are actually based on her own. = Luv = Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is a Nexus-9 replicant and personal assistant to Niander Wallace. He entrusts her as his right-hand agent running day-to-day affairs over Wallace Corporation. As KD6-3.7 notes, Wallace was fond enough of her to give her a name (and not just a serial number like he has). She also acts as his personal enforcer, ruthlessly killing police officers in the search for Rachael's child. Luv has an outer air of poise, but with a powerful fury simmering barely underneath. = Freysa Sadeghpour = Freysa Sadeghpour (Hiam Abbass) is the leader of the replicant underground. Apparently an older Nexus-8 model, she took care of Rachael's baby after she died in childbirth (K recognizes her in a photo of the baby from around 2022). Freysa helped to hide Rachael's child and erase the records of its past, but is organizing the underground to one day lead another replicant revolt. At some undisclosed point, Freysa lost her right eye: as seen with Sapper Morton, blade runners by this time remove the right eye of replicants as proof of a successful retirement (death), due to having a serial number embedded below the iris. Whether someone cut out Freysa's eye and left her for dead, or perhaps she cut out her own eye so she cannot be identified, is left unexplained. Freysa sends Mariette to keep tabs on K, and later saves K after Luv's team from Wallace Corp. captures Deckard. She explains the stakes of the situation to K and her past with Rachael's child, causing him to realize that it is actually Ana. Freysa warns K that if Wallace is able to interrogate Deckard and capture Rachael's child all will be lost, and urges K to kill Deckard before that can happen. K, however, saves Deckard while managing to fake Deckard's death by drowning in the ocean. = Sapper Morton = Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista) is an older Nexus-8 replicant, living in seclusion on a protein farm in the industrial outliers of Los Angeles. Despite his large size and strength, he is polite and well-read, collecting antique books. Morton used to be an army medic on the off-world colonies in several campaigns. K's encounter to \\"retire\\" him starts off the events of the film, as it leads K to discover Rachael's skeletal remains buried on Morton's farm. Morton was a member of the replicant underground and, along with Freysa, helped hide Deckard and Rachael's baby ‚Äì whose birth Morton describes as \\"a miracle\\". Using his army medic training, Morton personally conducted an emergency C-section on Rachael to save her baby after Rachael died in childbirth. Morton is contemptuous that K, a replicant himself, is a blade runner hunting his own kind (though K points out that he's a Nexus-9, not the same model as him). =Mariette= Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a replicant prostitute, and secretly a member of the replicant underground. Joi wants to experience sex with K, but the holographic projection of her AI lacks physical substance, so she hires Mariette to have sex with him ‚Äì while overlaying her projection on Mariette's body. Secretly, Freysa instructs Mariette to keep tabs on K by slipping a tracking device into his coat, which enables the replicant underground to save him after Wallace's agents assault him and capture Deckard in the ruins of Las Vegas. Mariette then brings K to meet Freysa personally. =Doc Badger= Doc Badger (Barkhad Abdi) is a street-wise fixer on the black market, who talks in City-speak creole. After obtaining a wooden horse that was in his allegedly fake implanted memory, K goes to Doc Badger's shop to have it analyzed. Badger is surprised that it is made of real wood (which is worth a fortune), and on chemical analysis, discerns that it was exposed to high radiation levels ‚Äì allowing K to narrow down his search to the ruins of Las Vegas. =Mister Cotton= Mister Cotton (Lennie James) runs a combination orphanage and salvaging operation in the vast junkyards on the outskirts of Los Angeles, putting the children to work picking apart piles of e-waste for useful scrap-metal. K's investigation leads him to discover that Rachael's child was passed off as a human child at Cotton's orphanage, though he doesn't remember it. K strong-arms him into revealing his records books, only to discover that someone stole the pages from that year to destroy the evidence. = Lt. Joshi = Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) is K's superior on the police force. She doesn't think replicants like K are as \\"real\\" as humans like her, though she does respect K. She is brutally killed by Luv after refusing to reveal K's location. = Coco = Coco (David Dastmalchian) is a police forensics investigator. He analyzes the ossuary that K found, revealing to him and Joshi that they belonged to a replicant female who died in childbirth (Rachael). Wallace's agent Luv later ambushes and kills him in his lab, to steal Rachael's skeletal remains and return them to Wallace for analysis. =Nandez= Nandez (Wood Harris) is another police investigator. He is disdainful of Coco's conclusion that Sapper Morton must have cared for Rachael's baby, though Coco points out that Morton clearly cared enough to give her a proper burial.

The Horses of Saint Mark in the centre, themselves taken from Constantinople in 1204, were returned to Italy in 1815. Repatriation is the return of art or cultural heritage, often referring to ancient or looted art, to their country of origin or former owners (or their heirs). The disputed cultural property items are physical artifacts of a group or society that were taken from another group usually in an act of looting, whether in the context of imperialism, colonialism or war. The contested objects vary widely and include sculptures, paintings, monuments, objects such as tools or weapons for purposes of anthropological study, and human remains.  Background  =War and looting=  Ancient world Victory Stele of Naram Sin, Akkadian Dynasty, reign of Naram-Sin (2254-2218 BC). Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris. War and the subsequent looting of defeated peoples has been common practice since ancient times. The stele of King Naram-Sin of Akkad, which is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, is one of the earliest works of art known to have been looted in war. The stele commemorating Naram-Sin's victory in a battle against the Lullubi people in 2250 BCE was taken as war plunder about a thousand years later by the Elamites who relocated it to their capital in Susa, Iran. There, it was uncovered in 1898 by French archaeologists.According to the Sumerian poem titled Curse of Akkad, Naram-Sin was responsible for the collapse of the Akkadian Empire as he looted and destroyed the Temple of Enlil and incited the wrath of the gods as a result, see Miles, p. 16 The Palladion was the earliest and perhaps the most important stolen statue in western literature.Miles, p. 20 The small carved wooden statue of an armed Athena served as Troy's protective talisman, which is said to have been stolen by two Greeks who secretly smuggled the statue out of the Temple of Athena. It was widely believed in antiquity that the conquest of Troy was only possible because the city had lost its protective talisman. This myth illustrates the sacramental significance of statuary in Ancient Greece as divine manifestations of the gods that symbolized power and were often believed to possess supernatural abilities. The sacred nature of the statues is further illustrated in the supposed suffering of the victorious Greeks afterward, including Odysseus, who was the mastermind behind the robbery. According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by Romulus, the first victor to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. In Rome's many subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.Miles, p. 13 As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned, Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule. However, the triumphal procession of Marcus Claudius Marcellus after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction.Miles, p. 65 According to Pliny the Elder, the Emperor Augustus was sufficiently embarrassed by the history of Roman plunder of Greek art to return some pieces to their original homes.Isager, Jacob, Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art, p. 173, 2013, Routledge, , 978-1-135-08580-3, Google Books 20th and 21st centuries One of the most infamous cases of esurient art plundering in wartime was the Nazi appropriation of art from both public and private holdings throughout Europe and Russia. The looting began before World War II with illegal seizures as part of a systematic persecution of Jews, which was included as a part of Nazi crimes during the Nuremberg Trials.See film, Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War by L.H. Nicholas, New York, 1994 During World War II, Germany plundered 427 museums in the Soviet Union and ravaged or destroyed 1,670 Russian Orthodox churches, 237 Catholic churches and 532 synagogues. A well-known recent case of wartime looting was the plundering of ancient artifacts from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war in 2003. Although this was not a case in which the victors plundered art from their defeated enemy, it was result of the unstable and chaotic conditions of war that allowed looting to happen and which some would argue was the fault of the invading US forces. Archaeologists and scholars criticized the US military for not taking the measures to secure the museum, a repository for a myriad of valuable ancient artifacts from the ancient Mesopotamian civilization. In the several months leading up to the war, scholars, art directors, and collector met with the Pentagon to ensure that the US government would protect Iraq's important archaeological heritage, with the National Museum in Baghdad being at the top of the list of concerns.Greenfield, p. 263 Between April 8, when the museum was vacated and April 12, when some of the staff returned, an estimated 15,000 items and an additional 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen. Moreover, the National Library was plundered of thousands of cuneiform tablets and the building was set on fire with half a million books inside; fortunately, many of the manuscripts and books were preserved. A US task force was able to retrieve about half of the stolen artifacts by organizing and dispatching an inventory of missing objects and by declaring that there would be no punishment for anyone returning an item. In addition to the vulnerability of art and historical institutions during the Iraq war, Iraq's rich archaeological sites and areas of excavated land (Iraq is presumed to possess vast undiscovered treasures) have fallen victim to widespread looting.Greenfield, p. 268 Hordes of looters disinterred enormous craters around Iraq's archaeological sites, sometimes using bulldozers.Greenfield, p. 267 It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 archaeological sites in Iraq have been despoiled. = Modern imperialism and looting = Paris Louvre ca. 1845 The scale of plundering that took place under Napoleon's French Empire was unprecedented in modern history with the only comparable looting expeditions taking place in ancient Roman history.Well known examples include Lucius Mummius' sack of Corinth or Marcus Claudius Marcellus' plunder of Syracuse, See Miles, p. 320 In fact, the French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization.Miles, p. 320 They also supported their actions with the opinion that their sophisticated artistic taste would allow them to appreciate the plundered art.See Miles, p. 320 Napoleon's soldiers crudely dismantled the art by tearing paintings out of their frames hung in churches and sometimes causing damage during the shipping process. Napoleon's soldiers appropriated private collections and even the papal collection.Miles, p. 321 Of the most famous artworks plundered included the Bronze Horses of Saint Mark in Venice and the Laoco√∂n and His Sons in Rome (both since returned), with the later being considered the most impressive sculpture from antiquity at the time. Laoco√∂n group, ca. 40-20 BCE. Museo Pio Clementino, Vatican The Laoco√∂n had a particular meaning for the French because it was associated with a myth in connection to the founding of Rome.The Laoco√∂n was the fabled Trojan priest who warned the Trojans not to accept the Wooden Horse that the Greeks offered to Athena. A god hostile to Troy sent sea serpents to kill him and his sons, which led to the fall of Troy and heralded the eventual founding of Rome, see Miles, p. 321 When the art was brought into Paris, the pieces arrived in the fashion of a triumphal procession modeled after the common practice of ancient Romans. Napoleon's extensive plunder of Italy was criticized by such French artists as Antoine- Chrysost√¥me Quatrem√®re de Quincy (1755‚Äì1849), who circulated a petition that gathered the signatures of fifty other artists.Ironically one of the names included Vivant Denon, the future Director of the Louvre and future facilitator of Napoleon's despoliation of artifacts from Egypt (see Miles, p. 326) With the founding of the Louvre Museum in Paris in 1793, Napoleon's aim was to establish an encyclopedic exhibition of art history, which later both Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler would attempt to emulate in their respective countries. L'Exp√©dition d'√âgypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte by Leon Cogniet, ca. 1835. Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris. Depicts Napoleon and his savants studying Egypt. Napoleon continued his art conquests in 1798 when he invaded Egypt in an attempt to safeguard French trade interests and to undermine Britain's access to India via Egypt. His expedition in Egypt is noted for the 167 \\"savants\\" he took with him including scientists and other specialists equipped with tools for recording, surveying and documenting ancient and modern Egypt and its natural history.Miles, p. 328 Among other things, the expedition discoveries included the Rosetta Stone and the Valley of the Kings near Thebes. The French military campaign was short-lived and unsuccessful and the majority of the collected artifacts (including the Rosetta Stone) were seized by British troops, ending up in the British Museum. Nonetheless, the information gathered by the French expedition was soon after published in the several volumes of Description de l'√âgypte, which included 837 copperplate engravings and over 3,000 drawings. In contrast to the disapproving public reaction to the looting of Italian works of art, the appropriation of Egyptian art saw widespread interest and fascination throughout Europe, inciting a phenomenon which came to be called \\"Egyptomania\\".Miles, p. 329 = Demands for restitution = A precedent for art repatriation was set in Roman antiquity when Cicero prosecuted Verres, a senate member and illegal appropriator of art. Cicero's speech influenced Enlightenment European thought and had an indirect impact on the modern debate about art repatriation.Miles, p.4 Cicero's argument uses military episodes of plunder as \\"case law\\" and expresses certain standards when it comes to appropriating cultural property of another people.Miles, p.5 Cicero makes a distinction between public and private uses of art and what is appropriate for each and he also asserts that the primary purpose of art is religious expression and veneration. He also sets standards for the responsibilities of imperial administration abroad to the code of ethics surrounding the collection of art from defeated Greece and Rome in wartime. Later, both Napoleon and Lord Elgin would be likened to Verres in condemnations of their plundering of art.Miles, p. 5 The Allied victory in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo marked the end of the Napoleonic Era.Art was repatriated for the first time in modern history when Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington returned to Italy art that had been plundered by Napoleon, after his and Marshal Bl√ºcher's armies defeated the French at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. This decision contrasted sharply to a long-held tradition to the effect that \\"to the victors go the spoils.\\" This is remarkable considering that in the battle of Waterloo alone, the financial and human costs were colossal; the decision to not only refrain from plundering France but to repatriate France's prior seizures from the Netherlands, Italy, Prussia, and Spain, was extraordinary.Miles, p. 330 Moreover, the British paid for the restitution of the papal collection to Rome because the Pope could not finance the shipping himself.Miles, p. 331 When British troops began packing up looted art from the Louvre, there was a public outcry in France. Crowds reportedly tried to prevent the taking of the Horses of Saint Mark and there were throngs of weeping ladies outside the Louvre Museum.Miles, p. 334 Despite the unprecedented nature of this repatriation effort, there are recent estimations that only about 55 percent of what was taken was actually repatriated: the Louvre Director at the time, Vivant Denon, had sent out many important works to other parts of France before the British could take them.Miles, p. 341 Wellington viewed himself as representing all of Europe's nations and he believed that the moral decision would be to restore the art in its apparently proper context.Miles, p. 332 In a letter to Lord Castlereagh he wrote: Wellington also forbade pilfering among his troops as he believed that it led to the lack of discipline and distraction from military duty. He also held the view that winning support from local inhabitants was an important break from Napoleon's practices.Miles, p. 144 The great public interest in art repatriation helped fuel the expansion of public museums in Europe and launched museum-funded archaeological explorations. The concept of art and cultural repatriation gained momentum through the latter decades of the twentieth century and began to show fruition by the end of the century when key works were ceded back to claimants.  Legal issues  = National government laws = In 1863 US President Abraham Lincoln summoned Francis Lieber, a German-American jurist and political philosopher, to write a legal code to regulate Union soldiers' behavior toward Confederation prisoners, noncombatants, spies and property. The resulting General Orders No.100 or the Lieber Code, legally recognized cultural property as a protected category in war.Miles, p. 350 The Lieber Code had far-reaching results as it became the basis for the Hague Convention of 1907 and 1954 and has led to Standing Rules of Engagement (ROE) for US troops today.Miles, p. 352 A portion of the ROE clauses instruct US troops not to attack \\"schools, museums, national monuments, and any other historical or cultural sites unless they are being used for a military purpose and pose a threat\\". In 2004 the US passed the Bill HR1047 for the Emergency Protection for Iraq Cultural Antiquities Act, which allows the President authority to impose emergency import restrictions by Section 204 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCIPA).Miles, p. 271 In 2003, Britain and Switzerland put into effect statutory prohibitions against illegally exported Iraqi artifacts. In the UK, the Dealing in Cultural Objects Bill was established in 2003 that prohibited the handling of illegal cultural objects. = International conventions = The Hague Convention of 1907 aimed to forbid pillaging and sought to make wartime plunder the subject of legal proceedings, although in practice the defeated countries did not gain any leverage in their demands for repatriation. The Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict took place in the wake of widespread destruction of cultural heritage in World War II is the first international treaty of a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict. The UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) Convention on Stolen or Illicitly Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 called for the return of illegally exported cultural objects http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm = UNESCO = The 1970 UNESCO Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) allowed for stolen objects to be seized if there were documentation of it in a museum or institution of a state party and the following agreement in 1972 promoted world cultural and natural heritageGreenfield, p. 270 The 1978 UNESCO Convention strengthened existing provisions; the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation was established. It consists of 22 members elected by the General Conference of UNESCO to facilitate bilateral negotiations for the restitution of \\"any cultural property which has a fundamental significance from the point of view of the spiritual values and cultural heritage of the people of a Member State or Associate Member of UNESCO and which has been lost as a result of colonial or foreign occupation or as a result of illicit appropriation\\". It was also created to \\"encourage the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed\\". In response to the Iraqi National Museum looting, UNESCO Director-General, K≈çichir≈ç Matsuura convened a meeting in Paris on April 17, 2003 in order to assess the situation and coordinate international networks in order to recover the cultural heritage of Iraq. On July 8, 2003, Interpol and UNESCO signed an amendment to their 1999 Cooperation Agreement in the effort to recover looted Iraqi artifacts.  Political issues  = Colonialism and identity = From early on, the field of archaeology was deeply involved in political endeavors and in the construction of national identities. This early relationship can be seen during the Renaissance and the proto-Italian reactions against the High Gothic movement, but the relationship became stronger during 19th century Europe when archaeology became institutionalized as a field of study furnished by artifacts acquired during the rise of European colonialism led by the British and French.Silberman, pp. 249-50 Colonialism and the field of archaeology mutually supported one another as the need to acquire knowledge of ancient artifacts justified further colonial dominance. As further justification for colonial rule, the archaeological discoveries also shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them. In the case of Egypt, colonial Europe's mission was to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history, or better yet, use European history to place ancient Egypt in a new spotlight.Said 86 With the archaeological discoveries, ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization.Colla 103 The French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization;Miles 320 by the same token, the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt. But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West, modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world. The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt. Museums furnished by colonial looting have largely shaped the way a nation imagines its dominion, the nature of the human beings under its power, the geography of the land, and the legitimacy of its ancestors, working to suggest a process of political inheriting.Anderson 164 It is necessary to understand the paradoxical way in which the objects on display at museums are tangible reminders of the power held by those who gaze at them.Colla 4 Eliot Colla describes the structure of the Egyptian sculpture room in the British Museum as an assemblage that \\"form[s] an abstract image of the globe with London at the center\\".Colla 5 The British Museum, as Colla describes, presents a lesson of human development and progress: \\"the forward march of human civilization from its classical origins in Greece and Rome, through Renaissance Italy, to modern-day London\\". The restoration of monuments was often made in colonial states to make natives feel as if in their current state, they were no longer capable of greatness.Anderson 181 Furthermore, sometimes colonial rulers argued that the ancestors of the colonized people did not make the artifacts. Some scholars also argue that European colonialists used monumental archaeology and tourism to appear as the guardian of the colonized, reinforcing unconscious and undetectable ownership. Colonial rulers used peoples, religions, languages, artifacts, and monuments as source for reinforcing European nationalism, which was adopted and easily inherited from the colonial states. = Nationalism and identity = As a direct reaction and resistance to colonial oppression, archaeology was also used for the purpose of legitimating the existence of an independent nation-state.Diaz- Andreu, p. 54 For example, Egyptian Nationalists utilized its ancient history to invent the political and expressive culture of \\"Pharaonism\\" as a response to Europe's \\"Egyptomania\\".Colla 12 Masada fortress, Israel Some argue that in colonized states, nationalist archaeology was used to resist colonialism and racism under the guise of evolution.Kohl, Fawcett, pp. 3-11 While it is true that both colonialist and nationalist discourse use the artifact to form mechanisms to sustain their contending political agendas, there is a danger in viewing them interchangeably since the latter was a reaction and form of resistance to the former. On the other hand, it is important to realize that in the process of emulating the mechanisms of colonial discourse, the nationalist discourse produced new forms of power. In the case of the Egyptian nationalist movement, the new form of power and meaning that surrounded the artifact furthered the Egyptian independence cause but continued to oppress the rural Egyptian population. Some scholars argue that archaeology can be a positive source of pride in cultural traditions, but can also be abused to justify cultural or racial superiority as the Nazis argued that Germanic people of Northern Europe was a distinct race and cradle of Western civilization that was superior to the Jewish race. In some conflicts that involve land ownership, archaeology is used to encourage confrontation by means of constructing of national myth as seen with the ancient fortress of Masada in Israel. In other cases, archaeology allows rulers to justify the domination of neighboring peoples as Saddam Hussein used Mesopotamia's magnificent past to justify his invasion of Kuwait in 1990.Kohl, Fawcett, p. 5 Some scholars employ the idea that identity is fluid and constructed, especially national identity of modern nation-states, to argue that the post- colonial countries have no real claims to the artifacts plundered from their borders since their cultural connections to the artifacts are indirect and equivocal.Cuno, pp. xx-xxxvi This argument asserts that artifacts should be viewed as universal cultural property and should not be divided among artificially created nation-states. Moreover, that encyclopedic museums are a testament to diversity, tolerance and the appreciation of many cultures.Cuno, pp. xxxv Other scholars would argue that this reasoning is a continuation of colonialist discourse attempting to appropriate the ancient art of colonized states and incorporate it into the narrative of Western history. = Cultural Survival and Identity = In settler-colonial contexts, many Indigenous people that have experienced cultural domination by colonial powers have begun to request the repatriation of objects that are already within the same borders. Objects of Indigenous cultural heritage, such as ceremonial objects, artistic objects, etc., have ended up in the hands of publicly and privately held collections which were often given up under economic duress, taken during assimilationist programs or simply stolen. The objects are often significant to the Indigenous ontologies possessing animacy and kinship ties. Objects such as particular instruments used in unique musical traditions, textiles used in spiritual practices or religious carvings have cult significance are connected to the revival of traditional practices. This means that the repatriation of these objects is connected to the cultural survival of Indigenous people historically oppressed by colonialism. Colonial narratives surrounding \\"discovery\\" of the new world have historically resulted in Indigenous people's claim to cultural heritage being rejected. Instead, private and public holders have worked towards displaying these objects in museums as a part of colonial national history. Museums often argue that if objects were to be repatriated they would be seldom seen and not properly taken care of. International agreements such as the 1970 UNESCO Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) often do not regard Indigenous repatriation claims. Instead, these conventions focus on returning national cultural heritage to states. Since the 1980s, decolonization efforts have resulted in more museums attempting to work with local Indigenous groups to secure a working relationship and the repatriation of their cultural heritage. This has resulted in local and international legislation such as NAGPRA and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects which take Indigenous perspectives into consideration in the repatriation process. Notably, Article 12 of UNDRIP states: > Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach > their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right > to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and > cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial > objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains. States > shall seek to enable the access and/or repatriation of ceremonial objects > and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and > effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples > concerned. The process of repatriation has often been fraught with issues though, resulting in the loss or improper repatriation of cultural heritage. The debate between public interest, Indigenous claims and the wrongs of colonialism is the central tension around the repatriation of Indigenous cultural heritage.  Controversy  The debate surrounding art repatriation differs case by case due to the specific nature of legal and historical issues surrounding each case, but below are listed general arguments commonly used: = Arguments against repatriation = * Artifacts are a part of a universal human history and encyclopedic museums like the British Museum, Mus√©e du Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art cultivate the dissemination of knowledge, tolerance, and broad cultural understanding. * Artifacts were frequently excavated or uncovered by looters, who brought to light a piece of artwork that would otherwise never have been seen; foreign-led excavation teams have uncovered items that contribute to cultural knowledge and understanding. * Nationalist retentionist cultural property laws claiming ownership are founded on constructed boundaries of modern nations with weak connections to the culture, spirit, and race to the ancient peoples who produced those antiquities. Cultural identities are dynamic, inter-related and overlapping so no modern nation-state can claim cultural property as their own or else they are promoting a sectarian view of culture. * Having artwork disseminated around the world encourages international scholarly and professional exchange. * Encyclopedic museums are located in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Paris, Berlin and New York, and if the artworks were to be moved, they would be seen by far fewer people. If the Rosetta Stone were to be moved from The British Museum to The Cairo Museum, the number of people who view it would drop from about 5.5 million visitors to 2.5 million visitors a year.Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone The Telegraph. By Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner, 20 Jul 2003. = Arguments for repatriation = * Encyclopedic museums such as the British Museum, Mus√©e du Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art were established as repositories for looted art during imperial and colonial rule, and thus are located in metropolitan cities out of view and reach of the cultures from which they were appropriated. * Precedence of repatriated art has already been set in many cases but the artworks that museums currently refuse to repatriate are the most valuable and famous artworks. * Foreign-led excavations have justified colonial rule and vice versa; in the pursuit of obtaining knowledge about the artifacts, there was a need to establish control over the artifacts and the countries where they were located. * The argument that art is a part of a universal human history is a derivative of colonial discourse that appropriated ancient art of other cultures into the Western historical narrative. * The encyclopedic museums that house much of the world's artworks and artifacts are located in Western cities and privilege European scholars, professionals and people. * The argument that artwork will not be protected outside of the Western world is hypocritical as much of the artwork transported out of colonized countries was crudely removed and damaged and sometimes lost in transportation. The Elgin marbles for example, were also damaged during the cleaning and \\"preservation\\" process. Moreover the Napried, one of the ships commissioned by di Cesnola to transport approximately 35,000 pieces of antiquities that he had collected from Cyprus, was lost at sea carrying about 5,000 pieces in its cargo. * Art is best appreciated and understood in its original historical and cultural context. * Art taken out of the country as a spoil of war, looting, imperialism, and colonialism is unethical, even if it isn't reflected in legislation. The possession of artwork taken under these conditions is a form of continued colonialism. * The lack of existing legal recourse for claiming the return of illicitly appropriated cultural property is a result of colonization. * Cultural property is a symbol of cultural heritage and identity and the appropriation of historical artworks is an affront to a nation's pride.  International examples  =Australia= Australian Aboriginal cultural artefacts as well as people have been the objects of study in museums; many were taken in the decades either side of the turn of the 20th century. There has been greater success with returning human remains than cultural objects in recent years, as the question of repatriating objects is less straightforward than bringing home ancestors. More than 100,000 Indigenous Australian artefacts are held in 220 institutions across the world, of which at least 32,000 are in British institutions, including the British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Australia has no laws directly governing repatriation, but there is a government programme relating to the return of Aboriginal remains and artefacts, the International Repatriation Program (IRP), administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts. This programme \\"supports the repatriation of ancestral remains and secret sacred objects to their communities of origin to help promote healing and reconciliation\\" and assists community representatives work towards repatriation of remains in various ways.Note: There was previously also a domestic Return of Indigenous Cultural Property (RICP) program run by the former Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Gweagal man Rodney Kelly and others have been working to achieve the repatriation of the Gweagal Shield and Spears from the British Museum and the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, respectively. In late October 2019 the first collection of many sacred artefacts held in US museums were returned by Illinois State Museum. A project coinciding with the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook's first voyage to Australia in 2020 has been working on a large number of artefacts to be returned, of which 42 Aranda and Bardi Jawi objects are the first group. The objects will be returned to central Australia, from where they were taken around 1920. The next phase of the project would repatriate 40 culturally significant objects from the Manchester Museum in the UK, including \\"body ornaments made from feathers, teeth and wood, hair bundles and belts\\". These would be returned to the Aranda, Ganggalidda, Garawa, Nyamal and Yawuru peoples. Project leader Christopher Simpson, from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), said they were hoping that this project could evolve into an ongoing program for the Federal Government. In November 2019, the objects were returned from Manchester Museum, which included sacred artefacts collected 125 years earlier from the Nyamal people of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The matter of repatriation of cultural artefacts such as the Gweagal shield was raised in federal parliament on 9 December 2019, receiving cross-bench support. With the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook's landing looming in April 2020, two Labor MPs called on the government to ‚Äúestablish a process for the return of relevant cultural and historical artefacts to the original custodians and owners\\". = Canada = The Haisla totem Pole of Kitimat, British Columbia was originally prepared for chief G'psgoalux in 1872. This aboriginal artifact was donated to a Swedish museum in 1929. According to the donor, he had purchased the pole from the Haisla people while he lived on the Canadian west coast and served as Swedish consul. After being approached by the Haisla people, the Swedish government decided in 1994 to return the pole, as the exact circumstances around the acquisition were unclear. The pole was returned to Kitimat in 2006 after a building had been constructed in order to preserve the pole. During the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, the Glenbow museum received harsh criticism for their display ‚ÄúThe Spirit Sings: Artistic Traditions of Canada's First People‚Äù. Initially, the criticism was due to the Olympic's association with Shell Oil who were exploring oil and gas in territories contested by Lubicon Cree. Later Mowhawk would sue the Glenbow museum for the repatriation of a False Face Mask they had displayed arguing that they considered it to be of religious ceremonial significance. The museum did not listen to the Indigenous claim and brought the issue to court. Glenbow won and was able to display the mask but the controversy highlighted the ways in which museums have often dismissed the living cultures they should be working with. This led to a movement to improve the involvement of Indigenous people in their representation in museums. The Canadian Museums Association and Assembly of First Nations led a Task Force on Museums and First Peoples. The task force would publish the report Turning the Page in 1992 that put forward a series of findings which would help improve Indigenous involvement in the museum process. Among these was a focus on creating a partnership between Indigenous people and the museum curators which involves allowing Indigenous people into the planning, research and implementation of collections. Museums were urged to also improve ongoing access to the collections and training for both curators and Indigenous people who want to be involved in the process. Finally, an emphasis was placed on repatriation claims of human remains, locally held objects (using practice customary to the Indigenous people in question) and foreign held objects. In 1998, over 80 Ojibwe ceremonial artifacts were repatriated to a cultural revitalization group by The University of Winnipeg. The controversy came as this group was not connected to the source community of the objects. Some of the objects were later returned but many are still missing. = Egypt = The iconic bust of Nefertiti Egypt is seeking the repatriation of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum and the Nefertiti bust from the Neues Museum in Berlin. = Greece = Greece is seeking repatriation of the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum, taken from the Parthenon by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. Since 1816, the British Museum has held the Parthenon Marbles (\\"In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting\\", text from the Marbles article), and, despite the tortuous and ill- explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display the marbles. = India = The UK has rejected India's fresh demand to return its priceless artifacts like \\"Kohinoor Diamond\\" and \\"Sultanganj Buddha\\" that were stolen, looted or smuggled during British colonial rule, citing a law (British Museum Act 1963) that prevents it from giving back the items. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is planning to join a campaign with the support of UNESCO and other countries to regain the artifacts. = Italy = Euphronios Krater In February 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art negotiated the repatriation of the Euphronios krater to Italy, from where it was thought to have been looted in the early 1970s. =Morocco= In 1612, the personal library of Sultan Zaydan An-Nasser of Morocco was trusted to French consul Jean Phillipe de Castellane for transportation. After Castellane waited for six days not receiving his pay, he sailed away. But four Spanish ships from Admiral Luis Fajardo's fleet captured the ship and took it to Lisbon (then part of the Spanish Empire). In 1614, the Zaydani Library was transmitted to El Escorial. Moroccan diplomats have since asked for the manuscripts to be returned. Some other Arabic manuscripts have been delivered by Spain, but not the Zaydani collection. In 2013, the Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute presented microfilm copies of the manuscripts to Moroccan authorities.*For details of the incident see: Chantal de la V√©ronne, Histoire sommaire des Sa'diens au Maroc, 1997, p. 78. *Catalogue: D√©renbourg, Hartwig, Les manuscrits arabes de l'Escurial / d√©crits par Hartwig D√©renbourg. - Paris : Leroux [etc.], 1884-1941. - 3 volumes.Journal of Early Modern History 18 (2014) 535-538 \\"Traveling Libraries: The Arabic Manuscripts of Muley Zidan and the Escorial Library\\" by Daniel Hershenzon of University of Connecticut () = South Korea = In November 2010, Japan agreed to return some 1,000 cultural objects to South Korea that were plundered during its colonial occupation from 1910-45. The collection includes a collection of royal books called Uigwe from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). = United Kingdom = In July 1996, the British Government agreed to return the Stone of Scone to Scotland, which had been taken to London in 1296 and placed in the newly-made Coronation Chair, following growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement. =United States= The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), passed in 1990, provides a process for museums and federal agencies to return certain cultural items such as human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, etc. to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organisations. However, the legislation has its limitations and has been successfully contested both domestically and extraterritorially.Kevin P.

These materials were abandoned during Operation Ezra and Nehemiah in the 1950s, when almost all Iraqi Jews made aliyah to Israel on the condition (imposed by the Iraqi government) that they leave their property behind. The archive has been in temporary US custody since 2003, and is scheduled to be transferred permanently to Iraq in 2018. This plan is controversial: some Middle-East scholars and Jewish organizations have opined that because the materials were abandoned under duress, and because almost no Jews live in Iraq today, the archive should instead be housed in Israel or the United States.

Cocio also has a place in Danish pop-culture. It's also at least moderately popular in the rest of Scandinavia and, to a lesser extent in some US regions, namely New England. It is also available in Spain, the UK, the Netherlands and Poland. A brand new factory in Esbjerg was first used in 2002. The factory is 8000 square metres, and contains Production and Administration. The new factory is much bigger than the old one.  History  Cocio was founded by Anker Pallesen in 1951. He and his wife began researching recipes in their own kitchen. In the beginning, the new factory produced 1000 bottles a day. In 1976, he sold the company to The Borden Food Corporation in United States, but the production continued in Esbjerg. In the mid 1980s Cocio released a new 1 litre bottle, and the drink gained popularity in Denmark. In 1988, Cocio had the first commercial in Danish television. In 1989, the Cocio company bought its rival company, Congo, who had a 25 percent market share at the time. Following the take-over, Cocio was alone on the Danish market. In 1998, Jamin Potamkin entered the product for a pilot program with the FDA to import the foreign milk on a trial basis (something that Denmark had been trying to do for over thirty years). This was the first time that a foreign milk was allowed to enter the United States, allowed to be distributed in all fifty states in a consumable form directly from the containment vessel. Though Arla Foods (then a wholly Danish company under the business name of MD Foods) also asked Jamin Potamkin to get other dairy products (in particular their yoghurt) into the United States and had their head of US operations ask for assistance, it was refused by Jamin Potamkin and the United States Federal Government. No other Danish liquid dairy products are allowed to enter the US territory, except for the maximum allowed under the Federal Import Milk Act (FIMA), which allows for liquid milk to enter as a percentage in a combined product, i.e. baby formula with 10% or less foreign milk. The current legality of entry of Cocio Chocolate Milk is being reviewed. In the 1999 the companies E. Bank Lauridsen Holding A/S and IAT Corporation decided to buy Cocio, to bring the Danish spirit to the company again. Then in 2002 Arla Foods became joint owner, buying a 50 percent share in the company. As of 1 January 2008, Arla Foods is the sole owner of Cocio A/S. Cocio A/S ceased cooperation with Jamin Potamkin (A/S Imports, Inc.) and the United States in 2003. And it was also once imported into the United States by CKF Foods Inc., but is no longer available to consumers in the USA.  Production  The production equipment is able to produce around 58,000 bottles per hour and is capable of packaging milk-based, juice, and iced-tea drinks in glass and tins.  Marketing  Famously, Cocio have used Eva Mendes as a front figure in their commercials.

He served as a general manager in the National Hockey League for the Oakland Seals, New York Islanders, and Florida Panthers. He developed the Islanders into a dynasty that won four consecutive Stanley Cups. He was often known as \\"The Architect\\", and \\"Bow-Tie\\" Bill, after the signature bow tie he always wore. Early life Torrey was from Montreal, and was raised near the Montreal Forum. His father worked as a stockbroker. He tried out for the Montreal Canadiens, and attended St. Lawrence University on a scholarship to play hockey. He lost his depth perception after he was hit in the left eye with a hockey stick, breaking his orbital bone. Torrey earned a degree in psychology, while also taking business classes. He then worked in Barrie, Ontario, at a radio station, and worked for NBC as a tour guide at Rockefeller Center. Hockey career =Oakland Seals= In the mid-1960s, Torrey began working for the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League, setting up promotional events. He became general manager of the Oakland Seals, a recently created expansion team in the National Hockey League (NHL), in 1969. The next year, Charlie Finley bought the team. Finley and Torrey clashed on issues ranging from personnel moves to marketing, and Torrey left the organization in 1971. =New York Islanders= In 1972, the expansion New York Islanders hired Torrey as their general manager, the organization's first employee. Rather than trade for veteran players in hopes of winning right away, Torrey was committed to building through the draft. He felt that pursuing a \\"win now\\" strategy didn't make sense in the long run. Torrey drafted Denis Potvin first overall in the 1973 entry draft. Montreal Canadiens General Manager Sam Pollock approached Torrey, hoping to trade for Potvin. Pollock's strategy was to offer a \\"quick-fix\\" package of mature players to exchange for the top draft pick, and it was tempting as the Islanders would immediately benefit from the trade. Torrey ultimately turned down the offer. Within several years Potvin blossomed into one of the NHL's elite defensemen and eventually became captain of the team. In the Islanders' first two seasons, the team finished last in the league. However, those dreadful records netted them high picks in the draft. With those picks, Torrey quickly assembled a roster that rose from a doormat to an NHL power. In the 1977 NHL amateur draft, Torrey had the 15th pick and had to make a tough decision between two promising forwards, Mike Bossy and Dwight Foster. Bossy was known as a scorer who couldn't check, while Foster could check but wasn't very good offensively. Coach Al Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, figuring it was easier to teach a scorer how to check. Bossy immediately emerged as one of the league's elite snipers in his first season, in which he set a then-NHL record with 53 goals as a rookie. Bossy achieved nine consecutive 50-goal seasons, as well as having more than adequate defensive skills. After helping minority owner John Pickett Jr. buy the franchise in 1979, Torrey was promoted to team president. In 1980, after the Islanders had underachieved in the playoffs for the past few years despite success in the regular season, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and Dave Lewis to the Los Angeles Kings in return for Butch Goring. Under Torrey's leadership, the Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cups: in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983. They won 19 consecutive postseason series. Along the way, he picked future Hall of Fame goalie Billy Smith in the team's original expansion draft and drafted five Hall of Fame players‚ÄîDenis Potvin, Clark Gillies, Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy, and Pat LaFontaine‚Äîin the entry draft. He also hired as head coach Al Arbour, another Hall of Famer and winner of four Cups as a player. After LaFontaine demanded a trade and held out for the start of the 1991‚Äì92 season, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project. He dealt LaFontaine, Randy Wood, and Randy Hillier (along with future considerations) to the Buffalo Sabres in return for Pierre Turgeon, Beno√Æt Hogue, Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain. He also sent captain Brent Sutter and Brad Lauer to the Chicago Blackhawks for Steve Thomas and Adam Creighton. Pickett turned over day-to-day control to a management committee of four minority owners. After the Islanders missed the playoffs in 1992, Torrey was forced to resign. =Florida Panthers= Torrey was named president of the Florida Panthers, a new expansion team, in 1993. Torrey built his new team similarly to the Islanders, acquiring young talent that included Rob Niedermayer, Ed Jovanovski, Radek Dvo≈ô√°k, and Rhett Warrener. The Panthers made it to the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals. The team reached the playoffs twice more prior to his retirement in 2001. He remained with the team as special advisor.  Honors  Torrey was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995. He is honoured with a banner in Barclays Center along with Al Arbour and six of the players he drafted. Torrey's banner has the words \\"The Architect\\" and the image of a bowtie. On October 23, 2010, the Florida Panthers honoured Torrey by retiring the number 93, and raising a banner in his honour to the rafters. The 93 represents the year (1993) when the Panthers franchise was incorporated into the NHL. Personal life Torrey had four sons, and ten grandchildren. Torrey died at his home in West Palm Beach, Florida, on the evening of May 2, 2018.

WSSW's management thought that perhaps packing the station with tourist-related information for the local area would help reverse its fortunes. The station did improve, but not enough.

WGFE's signal serves primarily the immediate Traverse City area and carries across the waters of Lake Michigan, and can frequently be heard in Manitowoc, Wisconsin and the eastern shoreline of Door County, Wisconsin. The station is simulcast on WGFE 95.5 FM in Glen Arbor, Michigan, and is also heard on translator W279CC (103.7 FM) in Alpena. Current on-air talent at WGFM/WGFE include morning drive host Brian \\"Cartman\\" Pfeifer, and DJs Jay Roberts, Nate \\"Smitty\\" Smith, and \\"NASCAR\\" Steve. Jay Roberts and \\"NASCAR\\" Steve are also DJs at WGFM's sister stations WGFN & WCHY, which simulcast as Classic Rock: The Bear. Each January, WGFM hosts a 12-hour marathon of Metallica music entitled the Metallica-Thon, which debuted on WGFE (then WJZJ) in 2009 shortly before entering into the first WGFM simulcast. History WGFM originally began broadcasting on August 15, 1968 as WCBY-FM, and aired beautiful music at first until switching to a simulcast of WCBY-AM. In 1982, the station became WQLZ, and began airing a CHR format to try to compete with WKHQ and WJML, but did not have the signal to compete with the two. In 1989, longtime northern Michigan radio personality and engineer Del Reynolds and wife Mary purchased 100,000 watt CHR WQLZ (formerly WCBY-FM) in Cheboygan. Shortly afterward, he changed the station's format to classic rock with the WGFM call letters, meaning \\"W-Gold-FM\\". The station's main focus was classic rock, but also played new cuts from classic rock artists as well. The station was live/local 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. and aired Westwood One's Adult Rock format overnights. Reynolds was the station's morning drive host at that time. In the 1990s, Del's radio empire grew when he acquired many other local stations and built new ones as well. He purchased WIDG 940 in St. Ignace, MI and WCBY AM in Cheboygan the station that launched his career in the late 1960s. He purchased 98.1 WMLB Glen Arbor, which had previously simulcast WUPS in Houghton Lake, and changed that to WGFN, giving WGFM a clearer signal in the Traverse City, MI area. He also took over 107.1 WCKC \\"Cadillac KC Country\\" Cadillac which was simulcasting his 102.9 WMKC \\"KC Country\\" St. Ignace, MI, but eventually changing to a WGFM simulcast. On September 14, 2009, WGFM began carrying The Free Beer and Hot Wings Show. It was also on that day when they started simulcasting with WJZJ 95.5 as Real Rock 105 and 95-5, airing a mix of The Zone's harder rock artists such as KoRn, Metallica and Alice in Chains with harder classic rockers such as Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne and Van Halen. Real Rock carried The Bob and Tom Show due to the duo's ratings in the upper northern Michigan region until August 2, 2010, when Free Beer & Hot Wings replaced it. The program was dropped by WGFM in March 2013, and replaced by the local morning drive program Cartman in the Morning.

(SPS) is a loan servicing company founded in 1989 as Fairbanks Capital Corp. with operations in Salt Lake City, Utah and Jacksonville, Florida. History Select Portfolio Servicing was created as a Utah company in 1989. Filings with both the Utah Secretary of State and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirm this. Filings with the Utah SOS and SEC would more accurately confirm that Fairbanks Capital Corp. was created as a Utah company in 1989. Fairbanks Holding (the parent company of Fairbanks Capital) was owned in part by PMI Group, Inc., and bond guaranty firm Financial Security Assurance. In November 2003, Fairbanks Capital Corp. and Fairbanks Capital Holding Corp. agreed to pay $40 million to settle with the FTC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which charged them with engaging in a number of unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices in the servicing of subprime mortgage loans. The Commission distributed the $40 million as redress to affected consumers. The settlement also imposed a number of specific limitations on Fairbanks‚Äôs ability to charge fees and engage in certain practices when servicing mortgage loans. In early 2004, Fairbanks changed its name to Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. and SPS Holding Corp. Fairbanks changed its name to Select Portfolio Servicing effective June 30, 2004 according to its Articles of Amendment. In 2005, Select Portfolio Servicing was purchased by Credit Suisse, a financial services company, headquartered in Z√ºrich, Switzerland.

Fictional character biography =Hector Ayala= The first White Tiger (Hector Ayala) was created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist George P√©rez in the black and white Marvel magazine, Deadly Hands of Kung Fu in the early 1970s. Hector Ayala was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He could transform into the superhuman White Tiger through the power of the Jade Tiger amulets. In his alter-ego, Ayala fought foes such as the Corporation crime cartel and teamed with heroes including Daredevil and Spider-Man. After many years of fighting crime and nearly being killed, having his secret identity publicly exposed by the villainous Lightmaster and becoming psychologically and physically addicted to the tiger amulets, Ayala retired. But after a while, the call to don the amulets and fight evil became too strong and Hector once again became the White Tiger. Soon after, Hector was wrongly accused of murder and convicted despite the efforts of his lawyer, Matt Murdock (Daredevil). Ayala was shot and killed trying to escape, shortly before evidence emerged that belatedly proved his innocence. =White Tiger (Heroes for Hire)= The second White Tiger was an actual white Bengal tigress evolved into a woman of East Indian descent. She was part of the short-lived Heroes for Hire revival in the 1990s. She was created by the High Evolutionary to hunt down an evil evolved wolf he had created, called the Man-Beast. White Tiger's bestial origins gave her cat-like speed and reflexes, and she was highly skilled in martial arts. White Tiger met Iron Fist, and intrigued by him, joined Heroes for Hire. White Tiger tried to keep her origins a secret, but during a training session with Iron Fist, she lost control and reverted to her tiger form. She was a valued member of the team, but she found that human emotions were more complex than her tiger mind could handle. She found herself growing more and more attracted to Iron Fist. White Tiger attacked Misty Knight when she felt that Iron Fist was attracted to Misty, trying to display dominance to the encroaching female, just as a tigress would do in the wild. When White Tiger finally captured the rogue Man-Beast, she begged the High Evolutionary to remove her human persona, unable to bear the heartbreak of not being able to be with the man she loved. He conceded and turned her back into a white Bengal tiger, promising Iron Fist that he would return her to the rainforests where he found her. =Kasper Cole= The third White Tiger was Kevin \\"Kasper\\" Cole, a police officer of mixed Jewish/African-American heritage who impersonated Black Panther when he found T'Challa's costume. Advised by the Falcon (Sam Wilson) that he needed to be more than just a man in a cat suit to achieve his goals, Kasper sought permission to eat the heart-shaped herb and gain enhanced powers like T'Challa by undertaking the Rite of Ascension. The villainous Erik Killmonger, offered him another option: a synthetic version of the heart-shaped herb and help finding Sal's son, in return for Kasper dropping the Black Panther identity, becoming a White Tiger of the Panther Cult, and doing a favor for Killmonger in the future. Kasper accepted, but then tracked down the boy using his newly enhanced senses and help from Queen Divine Justice and Everett Ross, thus lessening his debt to Killmonger. Afterwards, Kasper took on the identity of the White Tiger. He continues to chase promotion,Black Panther: World of Wakanda (2016) #6 allied with The Crew (a team of inner city superheroes) against 66 Bridges and Triage. The White Tiger wears a Vibranium-weave bulletproof costume which stops bullets. It can be cut only along the grain of the webbing, but cannot be punctured conventionally by blunt force. The boots have special Vibranium soles that absorb sound and impact, enabling him to leap off buildings up to 8 stories tall and land without injury. He can also literally run up the sides of buildings and walk on water. The suit's claws are retractable, and contain a new composite of the experimental \\"anti-metal\\" Vibranium, that can break down other metal alloys. =Angela del Toro= The fourth White Tiger is Hector Ayala's niece, Angela del Toro, an ex-FBI agent who worked on the Daredevil case, and inherited her uncle's Jade Tiger amulets. Angela quit the FBI to understand the amulets, and was trained in the use of their powers by Daredevil. Using the amulets' power to foil a robbery, she was touched by the overwhelming gratitude from the shopkeeper. Angela actually saved Daredevil from a crime lord and his bodyguard, using the amulets to give herself cat-like speed and fighting abilities. Realizing the powers she now possessed, she assumed her uncle's identity as the White Tiger. She was stabbed by Lady Bullseye and resurrected by the Hand, under their thrall until being healed by Black Tarantula. White Tiger received her own limited series in November 2006, written by Tamora Pierce. The Maker gave Angela an amulet from an alternate universe, which she used to confront the fifth White Tiger, Ava Ayala.New Avengers #7 Ava is forsaken by her Tiger God, and Angela gains the combined power of the two Tiger Gods. =Ava Ayala= The fifth White Tiger is Ava Ayala, the youngest sister of Hector Ayala. Ava first appeared in Avengers Academy #20 (December 2011) and was created by Christos Gage and Tom Raney. She appeared as a regular character in the series through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013) and appeared in the 2013 series Mighty Avengers. Ava also appears in Ultimate Spider-Man, voiced by Caitlyn Taylor Love where Ava is Hector's daughter instead of his sister.

Originally developed by Perfigo and marketed under the name of Perfigo SmartEnforcer, this network admission control device analyzes systems attempting to access the network and prevents vulnerable computers from joining the network. The system usually installs an application known as the Clean Access Agent on computers that will be connected to the network. This application, in conjunction with both a Clean Access server and a Clean Access Manager, has become common in many universities and corporate environments today. It is capable of managing wired or wireless networks in an in-band or out-of-band configuration mode, and Virtual Private networks (VPN) in an in-band only configuration mode. Cisco NAC Appliance is no longer in production and no longer sold as of the early 2010s. Mainstream support ending in 2015. Extended support ending in 2018.  Clean Access Agent  The Clean Access Agent (abbreviation: CCAA, \\"Cisco Clean Access Agent\\") resides on the client's machine, authenticates the user, and scans for the required patches and software. Currently the Clean Access Agent application is only available for some Windows and Mac OS X operating systems (Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Mac OS X); most network administrators allow clients with non-Windows operating systems (such as Mac OS 9, Linux, and FreeBSD) to access the network without any security checks (authentication is still required and is usually handled via a Web interface).  Authentication  After successfully authenticating via a web interface, the Clean Access Server will direct new Windows based clients to download and install the Clean Access Agent application (at this time, non-Windows based clients need only authenticate via the web interface and agree to any network terms of service). Once installed, the Agent software will require the user to re-authenticate. Once re-authenticated, the Agent software will typically check the client computer for known vulnerabilities to the Windows operating system being used, as well as for updated anti-virus software and definitions. The checks are maintained as a series of \\"rules\\" on the Clean Access Manager side. The Clean Access Manager (CAM) can be configured to check, install, or update anything on the user's system. Once the Agent application checks the system, the Agent will inform the user of the result ‚Äì either with a success message, or a failed message. Failed messages inform the user of what category(s) the system failed (Windows updates, antivirus, etc.), and instruct the user on how to proceed. Any system failing the checks will be denied general access to the network and will probably be placed in a quarantined role (how exactly a failed system is handled depends entirely on how the Clean Access Manager is configured, and may vary from network to network. For example: a failed system may simply be denied all network access afterward). Quarantined systems are then typically given a 60-minute window where the user can try to resolve the reason(s) for quarantine. In such a case, the user is only allowed connectivity to the Windows Update website and a number of antivirus providers (Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro, etc.), or the user may be redirected to a Guest Server for remediation. All other traffic is typically blocked. Once the 60-minute window expires, all network traffic is blocked. The user has the option of re-authenticating with Clean Access again, and continuing the process as needed. Systems passing the checks are granted access to the network as defined by the assigned role on the Clean Access Manager. Clean Access configurations vary from site to site. The network services available will also vary based on Clean Access configuration and the assigned user role. Systems usually need to re-authenticate a minimum of once per week, regardless of their status; however, this option can be changed by the network administrator. Also, if a system is disconnected from the network for a set amount of time (usually ten minutes), the user will have to re- authenticate when they reconnect to the network.  Windows Updates  Clean Access normally checks a Windows system for required updates by checking the system's registry. A corrupted registry may keep a user from being able to access the network.  Security Issues and Concerns  = User Agent Spoofing = The Clean Access Server (CAS) determines the client's operating system by reading the browser's user agent string after authentication. If a Windows system is detected, then the server will ask the user to download the Clean Access Agent; on all other operating systems, login is complete. To combat attempts to spoof the OS in use on the client, newer versions of the Server and Agent (3.6.0 and up) also probe the host via TCP/IP stack fingerprinting and JavaScript to verify the machine's operating system: > By default, the system uses the User-Agent string from the HTTP header to > determine the client OS. Release 3.6.0 provides additional detection options > to include using the platform information from JavaScript or OS > fingerprinting from the TCP/IP handshake to determine the client OS. This > feature is intended to prevent users from changing identification of their > client operating systems through manipulating HTTP information. Note that > this is a \\"passive\\" detection technique that only inspects the TCP handshake > and is not impacted by the presence of a firewall. = Microsoft Windows Scripting = The Clean Access Agent makes extensive use of the Windows Script Engine, version 5.6. It was demonstrated that removal or disabling of the scripting engine in MS Windows will bypass and break posture interrogation by the Clean Access Agent, which will \\"fail open\\" and allow devices to connect to a network upon proper authentication.  MAC Spoofing Prevention  = Device Segregation = While MAC address spoofing may be accomplished in a wireless environment by means of using a sniffer to detect and clone the MAC address of a client who has already been authorized or placed in a \\"clean\\" user role, it is not easy to do so in a wired environment, unless the Clean Access Server has been misconfigured. In a correct architecture and configuration, the Clean Access Server would hand out IP subnets and addresses via DHCP on its untrusted interface using a 30-bit network address and 2 bits for hosts, therefore only one host could be placed in each DHCP scope/subnet at any given time. This segregates unauthorized users from each other and from the rest of the network, and makes wired- sniffing irrelevant and spoofing or cloning of authorized MAC addresses nearly impossible. Proper and similar implementation in a wireless environment would in fact contribute to a more secure instance of Clean Access. = Certified- Device Timers = In addition, MAC-spoofing could further be combated with the use of timers for certified devices. Timers allow administrators to clear the list of certified MAC addresses on a regular basis and force a re- authorization of devices and users to the Clean Access Server. Timers allow an administrator to clear certified devices based on user roles, time and date, and age of certification; a staggered method is also available that allows one to avoid clearing all devices at once. = Complaints = Cisco NAC Appliance is notorious for creating disruptions in the Internet connections of users, considering a continuous connection between a computer and a server or another computer as suspicious activity. This is problematic for individuals using Skype or any webcam activity as well as online games such as World of Warcraft. With online games, the disruptions created by Cisco NAC Appliance cause the player to be logged off the gaming server. Numerous individuals who have experienced this rather blunt manner of security have openly expressed frustration with this software in forums as well as on Facebook with groups and posts.

It is a remake of an aerial warfare game of the same name, which was an early title on the original PlayStation. It was the first PlayStation 3 game to be available both for download on the PlayStation Network and for retail on Blu-ray Disc. For the United States, Blu-ray Disc and PlayStation Network versions were released on August 28, 2007. The PlayStation Network version was released in Europe, Australia and Japan on August 30, August 31 and October 4 respectively. The Blu-ray Disc version was released in Australia and Europe on September 20 and September 21, respectively, but was not released in Japan. Warhawk was initially intended to have both single-player and multiplayer modes, however the single-player element was canceled during development due to concerns that it was inferior to the game's multiplayer component. The game was released with five maps (each with five possible configurations) and four game types, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Zones and Capture the Flag. After the 1.4 update, the number of game types increased to six with the addition of the Hero and Collection modes. Three optional expansion packs for the game containing new maps and equipment increase the number of available maps to eight. Warhawk was met with a generally positive reception by reviewers. However, for a few months after its initial launch it was plagued by connection and server issues, including ranking issues with players, which were subsequently corrected in updates. The player is able to rank-up though 20 ranks ranging from Recruit to General, unlocking new personnel and aircraft customization options at each rank. A spiritual successor, Starhawk, was released in May 2012. Sony scheduled the Warhawk servers to be shut down on January 31, 2019, at 8 am GMT, providing notice by email to PlayStation Network members. Numerous players have organized on the game's subreddit community to continue playinghttps://www.reddit.com/r/warhawk/comments/alurwl/warhawk_is_officially_offline_we_will_continue_to/ through third party tools such as XLink Kai and an app called Warhawk Reborn Gameplay split screen. Warhawk is a third-person shooter set in a science fictional, perpetual war between the Eucadian Republic and Chernovan Empire (blue and red team, respectively). There are two ground vehicles, a jeep and a tank, and an armored personnel carrier is added by the Operation: Broken Mirror expansion. There are two air vehicles, the Warhawk and Nemesis (which are only cosmetically different), both of which can use nine weapons, an example is the AS-3 Tow Missile system. That weapon is the only weapon in the game where the player guides the weapon, the players screen is devoted to guiding the missile and leaving the player open to getting hit. But the upside is that it does massive damage and is the largest explosion in the game. The Omega Dawn expansion adds a dropship, and the Fallen Star expansion adds a jetpack. There are three turrets available to the player (anti-air missile turret, anti-air flak turret, and the .50 caliber anti-infantry machine gun). The game uses the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers. The game can be set to make use of these controllers' motion sensing function to allow the players to control aircraft and ground vehicles by tilting the controller in different directions rather than the more conventional methods of using the D-pad or analog sticks. However, a traditional control scheme is the default option. Warhawk offers online and offline multiplayer play. Offline allows for 1-4 players splitscreen (without bots). Online features up to 32-player battles, with the ability to have up to 4 players use one PlayStation 3 in split screen mode (on non-ranked servers that permit it). Players 2-4 can enter or exit the game while a match is in progress. The game uses medals and rewards, which are awarded for certain tasks. As of v1.50, the game supports trophies, which will be used in the online service PlayStation Home. Players are also able to customize their characters with armor squad markings, Warhawk paint schemes, and other accessories. More customization options are unlocked as the player increases in rank. Warhawk also allows the creation of clans, which may participate in online events and competitions. The game also makes use of arbiters, paid anonymous players who are tasked to find cheaters within the game. They are able to punish offending players in several ways, such as an email warning, a forum post, a kick, or a temporary/permanent ban. Arbiters can also request that the player's stats be erased. =PlayStation Home= Warhawk is one of many games that supports game launching in PlayStation Home. This feature allows players to host a game in Home and then launch it once other players have joined. The player may even invite friends to the game launch. Once the game has been launched from Home the players may return to Home at any time via the \\"Return to PlayStation Home\\" option that appears instead of the \\"Quit Game\\" option. On February 26, 2009, Incognito Entertainment and SCE Studios Santa Monica launched the Warhawk space for PlayStation Home. Beyond its unique aesthetics, the space is functionally similar to those for Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Far Cry 2, with one notable exception: the \\"Warhawk Sand Table\\". It's a place to plan in-game strategies using \\"VR\\" set-pieces‚Äîvehicles, maneuver icons, etc. - which can be moved around on 2D versions of any of the game's maps (and their variants). The first person to access the table is in control. Here's where one of the problems arises: anyone can walk up and watch as a user plans their \\"secret\\" strategy. Furthermore, there's no way to share or use the finished battle plan within the game. It's all up to each player's memory (or notepad). There is also a \\"Learning Terminal\\" (eight in all) that tells the users about General Hints, Weapons, and Flying. Outso developed the Warhawk game space for Incognito Entertainment and SCE Studios Santa Monica as well as the \\"Warhawk Sand Table\\" in the space. On February 11, 2010, a Warhawk personal space was released in Home. It includes the Sand Table featured in the Game Space as well as a mutliplayer turret mini-game. As of July 2010, the Warhawk game space has been removed from PlayStation Home, due to lack of players actually using the space. =Game modes= Warhawk supports six separate game modes compatible with all variations of all of the maps. *Deathmatch. Every man for himself. The game ends when a player reaches the score limit, or when time expires. *Team Deathmatch. Same rules as a deathmatch except the player is automatically assigned to either the Chernovan (red) or Eucadian (blue) teams. Game ends when the combined score limit is met or when time expires. :*Dogfight. A variation on Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch where you play only in the Warhawk/Nemesis planes. *Hero. A version of the team deathmatch where a hero is randomly selected on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total. *Capture the Flag. This mode of game play is by far the most popular among Warhawk players. In this mode each team has a flag at their base which they must defend while attempting to capture the second flag in their opponent's base. You can only capture the flag if your flag remains at the base. *Collection. This mode features four \\"cores\\" scattered along the map. The object is to collect as many cores as possible. Once a core has been collected, a new one will respawn in the same spot as where the player got it. If a player dies, all cores are lost, and an enemy, or nearby teammate can collect them. *Zones. The object of this mode is to capture various control points on the map. Each control point has three levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player can do this in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points for the number of zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or captured by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.http://www.exitplaystation.com/warhawk/gametypes.php Development Warhawk was first announced to the public in May 2005, with a working build shown at E3 in 2006. This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis motion sensing technology. In February 2007, it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled. This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single- player campaign, particularly when compared to the multi-player modes. Dylan Jobe, the game's director, stated, \\"If we were to continue down our single- player/multiplayer approach, it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer\\". The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in-game communication, and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen, whereby players can easily enter split screen mid-game. Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it. Only unranked servers have the ability to have it and even then, it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off. It was also revealed at the same time that Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network. In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America released news that PlayStation 3 consoles would be used as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 consoles in racks. Each server is able to support 32 players. The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as volumetric clouds. Following the games release, many issues with networking and player statistics were reported, such as delays in receiving points and awards, failure to receive the points or awards, and \\"connection failed\\" and \\"connection lost\\" errors. To address these issues, Incognito released several server-side patches before releasing the game's first update, Version 1.1. This update addressed the majority of issues users experienced with the game, with others being addressed in the Version 1.2 update. A demo was released on the PlayStation Store on October 9, 2008. =Release= There was initial confusion as to how this game would be distributed to consumers, after the announcement that it would be a multiplayer-only title. Sony announced on May 16, 2007, that there would be two iterations of the game. The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US$29.99 (¬£19.99, ‚Ç¨29.99), with an initial download size of 798MB. This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it. The second is a retail Blu-ray Disc version that sells for $59.99 (the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release), bundled with a Jabra BT125 Bluetooth headset in America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe, allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game. An additional third was later released on October 10, 2007 without the inclusion of a USB headset, which was priced at US$39.99. Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, concept art and trailers. Warhawk was re-released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28, 2008 for $29.99. =Updates and expansions= The armored personnel carrier in the Vaporfield Glacier map. Additional downloadable content (DLC) has been released, with more announced, since the game's launch. Expansions include new maps, weapon upgrades and character customization options. The DualShock 3 controller became compatible with the game upon the release of the version 1.20 patch. Incognito has stated that any future development on the incomplete single player campaign would only be released as a separate product, and not as an expansion to the current game. Warhawk updates are free, but expansion packs are sold online for a price. Updates are mandatory installations that must be completed in order to play the game. Expansion packs are optional, and the ability to purchase expansion packs is available within the menu of the game itself, as well as through the PlayStation Store. The 1.1 and 1.2 updates were released on October 19, 2007 and December 19, 2007 respectively, fixing numerous exploits and stability issues. Update 1.3 was released on April 2, 2008 and included two new weapons, eighteen new player-made customizations for planes and forty-four new player- made custom insignias for both troops and planes, integration of PlayStation Home, and new in-game chat features, such as cross-team chat. Also in update 1.3, the \\"stat padding\\" issue, a bug that allowed game players to cheat by increasing their points cumulatively by dropping the opponents' flag off the level and having it respawn back into the players' hands to repeat, was resolved by completely removing the ability to drop the flag. Update 1.4, released on July 16, 2008, features two new game modes called \\"Hero\\" and \\"Collection,\\" and introduced the Quick Join feature, which searches for a server that connects the user to matches that work with the user's current level.Warhawk v1.4 Update ‚ÄúFree Gameplay Modes!!‚Äù The next update, Version 1.5, was released on August 27, 2008 and includes trophy support, the winning entries from the European version of the paint and insignia contest,Warhawk Paint Scheme & Insignia Contest and allows the user to play music via the XrossMediaBar in-game.Warhawk v1.5 Update Three expansion packs have been released. The first, \\"Operation: Omega Dawn,\\" released on December 20, 2007, includes a new night-themed map, Omega Factory, and a new aircraft, the KT-424 Combat Dropship. The second expansion pack was released on April 17, 2008 entitled \\"Operation: Broken Mirror\\", which includes a new armoured personnel carrier equipped with an energy shield and the ability to boost, similar to a Warhawk, as well as serving as a mobile spawn point. A new map called Vaporfield Glacier was also included in the new expansion. It is the largest map to date, and includes 10 different layouts. In the PlayStation Store, there is also an option to purchase the first two Booster-packs for a reduced price,PlayStation.com - PLAYSTATION3 - Store - Warhawk Booster Combo PlayStation. and there will be another combo pack with all three included. The latest booster pack, \\"Operation Fallen Star,\\" was released on August 28, 2008 and added the Icarus MK1 Jetpack which allows troops to fire while airborne as well as a new map called Tau Crater. All three of the booster packs cannot be combined, nor can one affiliate with another, and people who do not own an expansion featured in a server they are attempting to join will not be able to join the server. On August 27, 2008 the 1.5 patch was released and included the addition of trophy support. A total of 57 trophies are available in the game, 10 of which are retroactive and can be obtained based on previously recorded statistics without the user having to complete tasks a second time. A further 34 are based upon gameplay and so are not retroactive. The trophies can be attained Split-screen or Unranked as well. Each of the available expansions also feature an additional 4 trophies.UPDATE:Warhawk Trophies -- July 1st, 6:00 pm MST,2008 Warhawk(PS3) - Playstation.com Forums PlayStation. On May 13, 2011, game developer Dylan Jobe unveiled the successor to the game entitled Starhawk on GTTV. Starhawk was released on May 8, 2012. Music The music is composed by both Christopher Lennertz and Timothy Michael Wynn. Their scores for this video game were recognized as one of the best video game scores of 2007 by IGN. Reception Warhawk generally received positive reviews, with its aggregate review scores being classed as generally favorable by Metacritic and GameRankings. PSM provided the lowest review score officially qualified by the GameRankings website. The magazine described it as \\"a third-person shooter that never quite gets off the ground.\\" Other reviews were more positive in their outlook. PSM3 described the game as \\"a masterpiece of balance, of design, and the jewel in Sony's online crown.\\" UK magazine Edge described it as an \\"instantly gratifying experience\\", also saying that the lack of a single-player campaign was made up for by \\"its brilliantly implemented notion of flight and considered balance\\". Nick Costanza and Vin Acosta were largely critical of the game, saying \\"it can't be taken seriously\\". 1UP.com gave Warhawk a positive review, but said, \\"It's just not quite $40 worth,\\" referring to the price of the downloadable version on the U.S. PlayStation Store. It was given the IGN Editors' Choice Award, calling it \\"a AAA experience that is an adrenaline rush for online fans.\\" Game Informer described Warhawk as \\"better than they'd hoped for\\". GamePro stated that although Warhawk offers an intense online combat experience, being dropped immediately into the action leaves you \\"somewhat bewildered\\" and doesn't give you that \\"feeling of connection\\" to the game. GameTrailers described Warhawk as \\"simply fun, easy to compete, but challenging to shine.\\" Adam Sessler from X-Play complimented the game's multiplayer only style saying \\"...I wouldn't have it any other way.\\" Gaming Target selected Warhawk as one of their \\"52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007\\" and awarded it \\"PlayStation 3-Exclusive Game of the Year\\".

It is a loose remake of the 1945 film My Name Is Julia Ross.  Plot  On a snowy New Year's Eve, a woman enters a train station to retrieve a satchel full of cash from a coin-operated storage locker. Later that night, she drives into an empty parking lot, and exits the car to place a call. As she anxiously smokes, she tells the other party she will wait only a few more minutes. After she gets back in her car, a man is seen in the rear-view mirror, in the backseat, unnoticed by her. When she catches sight of him, she is strangled, and her left ring finger is removed. In New York City, struggling actress Katie McGovern (Mary Steenburgen) lives in a cramped apartment, with her out-of-work photographer husband, Rob Sweeney (William Russ). Her visiting brother, Roland (Mark Malone), makes the small space even more confining. The couple's behind on rent and other bills, so, Katie feels the pinch to get an acting job which will help them, financially. Looking through a list of casting calls, Katie circles one: a vaguely-worded description for a lead actress, who must be available immediately, and willing to travel. At the open-call audition, in a room full of other women aspiring for the job, Katie is called in to be interviewed by a Mr. Murray (Roddy McDowall), who hires her immediately. The pair drive upstate into the midst of a raging snow storm. When they arrive at the secluded home of Dr. Joseph Lewis (Jan Rube≈°), he graciously welcomes her. Dr. Lewis is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair. He gives her a cursory tour of the house, which features a number of trophies from his hunting days, including 2 massive, stuffed polar bears. Katie asks to use the phone to call Rob, but finds it has no dial tone. Dr. Lewis surmises the storm must have downed the lines, and Mr. Murray would drive her into town in the morning to make her call, if necessary. Dr. Lewis explains that Katie has been hired to replace Julie Rose, an actress who had a nervous breakdown during a film shoot, and was picked due to her physical resemblance, as the plan is to still utilise the footage shot by Julie, with new footage of Katie. When Katie sees pictures of Julie Rose (Also Steenburgen.), she is stunned by the resemblance, exclaiming, \\"I could be her sister!\\" Dr. Lewis (who is professionally retired from his field, and now is an investor in this independent film), says a test- reel on videotape will be shot tomorrow, which the director will view when he arrives. The following day, Mr. Murray tries to drive Katie into town to make her phone call, but his car will not start. Mr. Murray cuts and dyes Katie's hair to match the photos of Julie. Asked how they met, Mr. Murray explains that Dr. Lewis was his psychiatrist. The shoot goes well. Katie's lines all seem to eerily describe the attack seen at the film's beginning. Mr. Murray sneaks out and reconnects the car's ignition. He drives to a house, where a woman, whose face is never shown, watches him from her upstairs window. Mr. Murray slips the videotape through the mail slot. The unseen woman sits down, facing a screen, and watches the video of Katie. After the test footage ends, Dr. Lewis appears on the video to tell the anonymous woman-viewer they need to meet, and he will contact her soon. The next morning, Katie finds a notebook with Polaroids of Julie's corpse. Horrified, she confronts Dr. Lewis, who explains that Julie's breakdown ended with her suicide. In the parlour, Katie's startled by a pop in the fireplace, where she sees her driver's license burning. Unable to retrieve it, she rushes to her room and finds all of her ID is missing from her wallet. Katie flees the house without a coat. The weather is so ferocious, she ends up crawling to the top of a hill where, to her horror, she looks up to see Mr. Murray, who tells her Dr. Lewis is worried, and is waiting for her. Back at the house, Dr. Lewis pretends her imagination is running wild. Katie realizes that Mr. Murray has drugged her hot chocolate. In her room, she barricades the door with furniture before she passes out. As she sleeps, Mr. Murray enters her room from behind a full- length mirror. Katie wakes up in a fresh sleeping gown with a bandaged hand. She peels off the bandages to find her left ring finger has been removed, and screams in horror. Her barricade undisturbed, Katie quickly finds the secret door and a staircase to the attic, which has a working phone. She calls Rob and explains that they are going to kill her. Rob asks where she is, but Katie can only remember vague landmarks about the drive upstate. Rob orders her to call the police, which she does. As she collapses, she sees the body of Julie Rose. Mr. Murray arrives and rips the handset off the phone, taking her back downstairs to Dr. Lewis. As Dr. Lewis redresses her finger, he explains that Julie was involved in a vicious family feud with her sister, Evelyn. As a radical therapy, Dr. Lewis had convinced her to blackmail her sister, theorizing that it would help her achieve a catharsis. He was pleased with Julie's progress, but did not expect Evelyn to kill her, ordering the hit man to take her finger as proof. During his explanation, the police arrive. Katie is confused from a sedative and Dr. Lewis claims that she is his patient, so the police leave without much of an investigation. Meanwhile, Rob and Roland have begun to drive upstate, using the handful of clues they have to try to locate Katie. Katie wakes to find Evelyn standing over her. Dr. Lewis offers her as proof that Julie is still alive, to continue the blackmail. Katie fakes an escape attempt, luring Dr. Lewis and Mr. Murray out of the house. She pleads with Evelyn to help her escape, but Evelyn is convinced that she is really Julie and attacks her. Katie kills Evelyn and poses as her to try to escape. Mr. Murray realizes the ruse, but Katie stabs him in the neck. Dr. Lewis is also not fooled by the disguise and lunges at Katie from his wheelchair. Using a fire poker as a crutch, he follows her upstairs and eventually into the attic, where Katie manages to kill him. Rob and Roland arrive with the police, having convinced them to revisit the house.

Co-writer Marc Shmuger, a classmate and friend of Penn's son Matthew Penn, began directing, but soon ran into difficulties. Producer John Bloomgarden took over directing in the interim. Studio executive Alan Ladd, Jr. asked Arthur Penn, who had initially brought the project to the studio's attention, to direct. Penn reluctantly agreed. Dead of Winter was filmed on location in Ontario, Canada.  Reception  = Critical response = Dead of Winter has a 77% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 13 reviews. In Janet Maslin's review for The New York Times, she wrote, \\"When a director approaches Gothic horror with this much enthusiasm, the results are bound to be as merry as they are frightening. So audiences for Arthur Penn's Dead of Winter are in for a hair-raising treat.\\"Maslin, Janet (February 6, 1987). 'Dead of Winter' A Gothic Horror Tale', The New York Times. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half out of four, and concluded that, \\"The movie itself is finally just an exercise in silliness ‚Äì great effort to little avail ‚Äì but the actors have fun with it, the sets work and there are one or two moments with perfect surprises.\\"Ebert, Roger (February 6, 1987). Dead of Winter. Writing for The Washington Post, Paul Attanasio stated that Steenburgen \\"manages with √©lan an assignment that has her playing three parts\\". He faulted the lengthy build-up to the final confrontation, specifying, \\"An hour's worth of exposition is a long wait, and if the payoff isn't quite worth it, it is fun. After nine yards of soggy oatmeal, you're reintroduced to the pleasures of an old-fashioned haunted house.\\"Attanasio, Paul (February 6, 1987). \\"Dead of Winter\\" The Washington Post. The staff review of the film in Variety found Rube≈° to be lacking as the villain, writing, \\"Steenburgen and McDowall are the adversaries to follow, even though it would seem more likely that the wheel-chair bound doctor (Jan Rube≈°) should be the one to watch. Rube≈° is simply not sinister enough to be the mastermind behind this scheme.\\"Staff (December 31, 1986) \\"Dead of Winter\\" Variety.

He was rector of Lw√≥w University of Technology from 1938 to 1939 and vice-rector of Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology from 1945 to 1947.  Scientific activity  Edward Sucharda's work was distinguished by four main areas of interest: The first was related to the chemistry of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, which he took over from his mentor, Prof. Niementowski . It included the development of synthesis of azaaromatic compounds: derivatives of pyridine, naphthyridine and phenanthroline (pupils and co-workers: Bogus≈Çaw Bobra≈Ñski, Henryk Kuczy≈Ñski, C. Troszkiewicz, Zofia Skrowaczewska). Another important work was the synthesis of indigo and its derivatives by an ortho-condensation route (jointly with Edwin P≈Ça≈ºek). The second separate field of interest of Prof. Suchardy was the quantitative analysis of organic compounds. In 1928, together with B. Bobra≈Ñski, he presented a completely new method for determining the carbon and hydrogen content in organic compounds, while adapting the Pregl method (for the determination of nitrogen). The method has been widely described and used around the world. The third group of interests were issues of a technological nature in close cooperation with the Boruta dye factory in Zgierz and the oil industry in Drohobych (collaborators: Tadeusz Mazo≈Ñski, H. Kuczy≈Ñski and Leonard Kuczy≈Ñski). The last topic appeared around 1936 and concerned the chemistry and processing of terpenoid products, including for example, the problem of obtaining camphor. Later he spent several years studying the structures of terpene compounds (co-workers: H. and L. Kuczy≈Ñski). In total, he published 57 scientific papers, submitted 5 patents and co-authored two high school textbooks.

He is probably best known for, and was most proud of, the Newell Act, which created the United States Life-Saving Service (a federal agency that grew out of private and local humanitarian efforts to save the lives of shipwrecked mariners and passengers; which ultimately merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard in 1915). Early life Newell was born in Franklin, Ohio, the son of James Newell and Elisa Hankinson. His grandfather, Hugh Newell, came from Ireland in 1704. His parents, from old New Jersey families, moved back to New Jersey when he was two years old. He married Joanna VanDusen from New Brunswick. The marriage produced three sons and a daughter, with one son dying in early childhood. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1836an on-campus apartment complex at Cook College, the agricultural school of what is now Rutgers University, is named for himand from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1839, and began to practice medicine in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township, New Jersey, where he lived, and was one of the local volunteers for shipwrecks across Barnegat Bay.Kowalczyk, Frank. \\"The Shipwreck of the Powhatan\\" , The Society Scroll newsletter of the Ocean County Historical Society, September 2007. Accessed January 12, 2008. It was from the frustrating experience of watching a ship full of passengers perish because the volunteers could not reach them that he first thought of creating a life-saving service. He later moved to Allentown, New Jersey, which was to be his residence for the rest of his life. Political life = First public office = The first office known to be held was that of tax collector for Upper Freehold Township, New Jersey. He reported in an interview to a reporter later in life to have said he \\"was never so proud of his life as when he received his certificate of that office\\" = Entering Congress= Newell was elected as a Whig to the Thirtieth and Thirty-first United States Congresses (March 4, 1847‚ÄîMarch 3, 1851), but did not run for re-election in 1850. It was during his first term that he authored the Newell Act. Under this Act, a series of light house stations were set up between Sandy Hook and Little Egg Harbor. Each station was equipped with a cannon that could shoot a line out to a ship for aiding in rescue efforts. The service was extended from Long Island to Cape May, and after rescuing 200 passengers and crewmembers from the Scottish brig Ayrshire, it was extended over the entire East Coast. He also served on multiple committees. He served on the Foreign Affairs and Revolutionary Claims committees. =Governor= As the Whig party foundered, the opposition to the Democratic Party consisted of the new American party (also called the Know-Nothings), and the nascent Republican Party. The former stood for limiting immigrants' role in politics (primarily Irish Catholics at the time), while the latter was opposed to the extension of slavery to the territories. The parties united in an attempt to defeat the powerful Democratic party, and, as a former Whig who was also opposed the extension of slavery, Newell was nominated at a joint convention in 1856. He won by just 3,000 votes over Democratic candidate William C. Alexander, but the Democrats won most of the seats in the legislature. As governor, he urged lower taxes and balanced budgets; improvements in the school system; stricter naturalization procedures; restrictions on suffrage of naturalized citizens; as well as improvements to education and to life-saving systems. He worked hard to unite the American and Republican wings of the New Jersey Opposition As governor he presided over the Court of Pardons, and in late 1857 was involved in a major controversy. James P. Donnelly, a medical student from a New York City Irish family was convicted of murdering Alfred S. Moses and sentenced to death in a Monmouth County court. To the Irish Catholics of New Jersey, this quickly became a large social and political issue, as he was convicted and sentenced by a Protestant judge and jury on what they saw as doubtful evidence. After Donnelly's appeals ran out, he sought commutation to a life sentence. While the Court of Pardons voted 6 to 2 against a commutation, Newell claimed it had been a tie vote and that he cast the deciding vote for execution. This proved significant in Newell's political career later. =After the governorship= Newell attended the Republican National Conventions in 1860 and 1864. Abraham Lincoln appointed Newell to the Life-Saving Service of New Jersey, a position he held until he re-entered congress in 1865. Newell was nominated for Congress in 1864 and won on a platform of support for the war. But in 1866 he was defeated, in part because of his strong anti-immigrant past and his role in the Donelly case. He returned to medicine, but unsuccessfully sought the nomination for Congress in 1868. He did win the nomination in 1870 but lost the election. He ran for governor again in 1877, but lost to the popular Civil War general George B. McClellan. Again, his role in the Donnelly case was an issue, particularly in Irish Jersey City. In 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Newell to be the governor of Washington Territory. He supported many of the same policies he did while he was governor of New Jersey: strengthening life-saving systems on the Pacific Ocean, lower taxes, temperance, and forced acculturation of Native Americans. He served until 1884, and then was United States Indian inspector for a year. He then resumed the practice of medicine, this time in Olympia, and remained there 14 more years. While living in Olympia, he was elected mayor. Then, in 1899, at the age of 82, he returned to Allentown, continuing the practice of medicine, and took an active role in the Monmouth County Historical Association. =Death= He died at his home in Allentown at 11:45 a.m. August 8, 1901, and was interred in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Allentown. He was reportedly sick for several days. Following his death, Governor Voorhees draped the State House in Trenton, New Jersey, in black as a tribute of respect to him. He remained in state at the State House in Trenton for three days. He was then placed in a vault in Greenwood Cemetery. His only living child was in Italy at the time of his death. When his daughter returned, he was then removed and placed in Allentown Presbyterian Cemetery at his family plot.

The paintings for which he is most noted include figure compositions, portraits and still lifes, which are often distinguished by unusual perspective effects. Life and work Casorati was born in Novara. He showed an early passion for music, but abandoned his study of piano after a serious illness, and became interested in art.Lamberti & Fossati 1985, p. 242 To please his mother he studied law at the University of Padua until 1906, but his ambition to be a painter was confirmed in 1907 when a painting of his was shown in the Venice Biennale. The works he produced in the early years of his career were naturalistic in style, but after 1910 the influence of the symbolists and particularly of Gustav Klimt turned him toward a more visionary approach. In 1915 he had a solo exhibition at the Rome Secession III, where he showed several paintings and the first of his sculptures in varnished terracotta.Lamberti & Fossati 1985, p. 250. His military service in World War I began that year and lasted until his discharge from the army after the death of his father in 1917.Turner 1996, p. 919. In 1918, \\"intrigued by the decadent atmosphere of Turin with its sinister views\\", he settled there with his mother and two sisters. His works of the next decade typify, in their emphasis on geometry and formal clarity, the \\"return to order\\" then prevalent in the arts as a reaction to the war. Although many critics found his work cold, cerebral, and academic, Casorati achieved international recognition as a leading figure in this movement.Cowling & Mundy 1990, p. 63. Often working in tempera, Casorati drew inspiration from his study of Renaissance masters, especially Piero della Francesca, as in his 1922 portrait entitled Silvana Cenni. This symmetrical composition of a seated woman in a white dress is perhaps the best-known of the artist's works.Cowling & Mundy 1990, p. 64. In it, the careful rendering of volumes results paradoxically in a sense of unreality which is characteristic of Casorati's art. In 1925, Raffaello Giolli summarized the disconcerting aspects of Casorati's art‚Äî\\"The volumes have no weight in them, and the colors no body. Everything is fictitious: even the living lack all nervous vitality. The sun seems to be the moon ... nothing is fixed or definite\\"‚Äîand argued that these very qualities give his work its originality, and connect him to the metaphysical painters.Cowling & Mundy 1990, p. 66. Casorati himself wrote, in 1931: \\"In taking up, against me, the old polemic of classicism and romanticism, people rail against intellectualized and scholastic order, accuse my art of being insincere, and wilfully academic‚Äîin a word, of being neoclassical. ... since my art is born, so to speak, from within, and never has its source in changing \\"impressions\\", it is quite natural that ... static forms, and not the fluid images of passion, should be reflected in my works\\". Briefly arrested in 1923 for his involvement with an anti-Fascist group, Casorati subsequently avoided antagonizing the regime. Beginning in 1923, he opened his studio to the young art students of Turin, and to emerging Italian artists such as Quinto Martini and painters of the Gruppo dei Sei (Group of Six). In 1925, one of his students was Daphne Mabel Maugham, later his wife.Notes for exhibition of Solo Donna by Gianfranco Schialvino in the city of Bra in 2011, page 122. One of his later students was the Italian painter Enrico Accatino. His Work Carit√† di San Martino, 1939, is in Museo cantonale d'arte of Lugano.Museo cantonale d'arte of Lugano: Felice Casorati After 1930 the severity of Casorati's earlier style softened somewhat and his palette brightened. He continued to exhibit widely, winning many awards, including the First Prize at the Venice Biennale of 1938. He was also involved in stage design. He died in Turin in 1963. Most of Casorati's important works are in Italian collections, public and private, including the Modern Art Revoltella Museum in Trieste and Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna.

During the era of steam locomotives, the town's primary industry was servicing trains for the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (often shortened to D&RG;, D&RGW;, or Rio Grande). The fortunes of the town were closely linked with those of the railroad until the changeover to diesel locomotives, when the town started to decline. In April 1983, a massive landslide (specifically a complex earthflow) dammed the Spanish Fork (river). The residents were evacuated as nearly of water backed up, flooding the town. Thistle was destroyed; only a few structures were left partially standing. Federal and state government agencies have said this was the most costly landslide in United States history, the economic consequences of which affected the entire region. The landslide resulted in the first presidentially declared disaster area in Utah. U.S. Route 6 (US‚Äë6), U.S. Route 89 (US‚Äë89) and the railroad (now part of Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor) were closed for several months, until they were rebuilt on a higher alignment overlooking the area. The remains of Thistle are visible from a view area along US‚Äë89 or from the California Zephyr passenger train. Geography Thistle is about southeast of Salt Lake City, at the confluence of the two primary tributaries to the Spanish Fork (river), Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek. This confluence, at an elevation of , is also the junction of two naturally formed routes across the mountains of central Utah. The primary route crosses the Wasatch Mountains, via the Wasatch Plateau and Soldier Summit. This route was carved by the tributaries of the Price River on the eastern side of the mountains and the Spanish Fork on the west. In addition, Thistle Creek provides a route south from Thistle towards the communities of the Sanpete and Sevier valleys. The Spanish Fork flows northwest from Thistle, towards and through the city of Spanish Fork, before reaching Utah Lake. These natural paths have provided the route of several transcontinental trails, highways and railroads since their discovery. The named transportation arteries passing through Thistle include: US‚Äë6 (originally numbered US‚Äë50), US‚Äë89, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's Utah Division (now part of Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor) and D&RGW;'s Marysvale Branch line (abandoned because of the landslide). History The trade route on which Thistle lies was used by Native American tribes before the arrival of European settlers; two Ute chiefs, Taby and Peteetneet, led seasonal migrations through the canyon each spring and fall. The first recorded journey by Europeans to modern Thistle was the Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition, which was escorted through the territory by Indian guides. A small group of Utes inhabiting the canyon frequently clashed with newcomers, and as a result were forcibly relocated in the 1870s. Most of Thistle's residents were railroad employees sent to live in the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914. =Railroads= The first railroad track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge spur line servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired the line in a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to standard gauge. The D&RGW; connected this line with one they had built west from Colorado, completing a link from Salt Lake City to Denver. The railroad built several facilities in Thistle to service and prepare trains for the change in grade and curvature of the line. The railroad placed helper engines on eastbound trains at Thistle for the ascent to Soldier Summit. The town provided a meal service for the trains until the use of on- board dining cars eliminated the need for meal stops. D&RGW; around the landslide areaalt=An aerial picture of a de-stabilized mountain sliding and creating a dam and lake. Various construction activity is present to the left of the slide area. Thistle saw more rail traffic with the construction of the Marysvale Branch line. This line branched from the main at Thistle, following modern US‚Äë89 towards mines near Marysvale. Another line through Thistle, paralleling the D&RGW; main, was built by the Utah Railway. The two lines were later combined into a dual-track main line, as part of a trackage rights agreement between the two companies. Rail traffic through Thistle continued to increase as the Rio Grande cooperated with connecting railroads, making the rail line through Thistle a bridge line for transcontinental rail traffic. The growth of Thistle was closely tied to the success of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad throughout the era of steam locomotives. At its peak, around 1917, Thistle had about 600 residents. The town's railroad infrastructure included a five-stall roundhouse, depot, machine shop, and structures to restock passing trains with sand, coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911. In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western began to phase out steam locomotives in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded in importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle. =Landslide= alt=View through a dirty window, showing power lines in the foreground and a scarred mountain with the scar leading to an earthen dam. Rio Grande maintenance personnel began noticing unstable ground downstream from Thistle years before the landslide occurred. Maintenance crews repaired the track on several occasions, but they did not fully investigate the problem. Beginning with the remnants of Hurricane Olivia, the autumn and winter of 1982‚Äì83 featured record-breaking snow and rainfall. As the spring thaw melted the winter snow, the mountains in the area became saturated with water. By April 1983, track deformation was a serious issue. On April 13, the division track master flew to Denver to explain the situation at a specially-called staff meeting. On the same day, a Utah Highway Patrol officer struck a newly created buckle in the highway that threw him against the roof of his vehicle. By the end of the day, a full maintenance crew was struggling to keep US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89 open. All trains were limited to speeds less than , and were accompanied by maintenance personnel who had to continually work to keep the tracks in line. The last train to pass through downtown Thistle was the westbound Rio Grande Zephyr, on April 14, 1983 at about 8:30 p.m. That night, both US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89 and the rail line were closed. One westbound freight train that had already left Denver was turned back. All through trains between Denver and Salt Lake City were rerouted to Union Pacific Railroad's Overland Route through Wyoming. By April 16, the tracks were completely buried and a voluntary evacuation order was issued for the town. Looking northwest from the view area along US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89 showing the abandoned railroad and highway grades next to the replacement alignments, June 2010 On April 17, a final attempt to keep the landslide from blocking the flow of the river failed. That day, the Utah Department of Transportation and the Rio Grande announced plans to abandon the existing transportation arteries and build new corridors. Both the highway and railroad would be re-routed by blasting a path scaling the north wall of Spanish Fork Canyon. The new arteries would pass the slide by dynamiting through Billies Mountain, also along the north canyon wall. Engineers estimated the dam created by the toe of the landslide would eventually reach tall. The evacuation order was changed from voluntary to mandatory. Volunteers transported as many people and belongings as possible to the small town of Birdseye, about south. Most residents were able to recover only a fraction of their belongings; some had less than two hours' notice before the water reached their house. Thistle's oldest resident celebrated her 90th birthday at the evacuation center in Birdseye. By the 18th, the waterline had reached the rooftops of the 22 previously occupied houses. By the 19th, an entire mountain was moving at about per hour, and US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89 was buried by of soil. Spanish Fork (river) past the dam formed by the Thistle landslide, July 2015 Governor Scott Matheson requested federal aid to deal with the situation. After a visit to the area by the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. president Ronald Reagan issued the first presidential disaster area declaration for the state of Utah. The landslide eventually formed a dam that created a lake long and over deep. Concerned the dam could fail, the state of Utah decided to build a tunnel to re-route the flow of the Spanish Fork (river). The residents of downstream Spanish Fork were told to be prepared to evacuate. Engineers estimated that if the dam failed, they would have 30 to 45 minutes notice before the water reached the city. =Aftermath= alt=A partially submerged house covered in overgrown vegetation and with a deteriorating roof Thistle was almost completely destroyed. Most wooden buildings were carried away in the floodwaters. The state installed a temporary pumping station to prevent the lake from overflowing the dam; patrol boats skimmed up the floating remains of the town to prevent the debris from blocking the pumps. Most remains were either naturally deposited or placed on the eastern shore of the lake. By autumn, the tunnels to restore the flow of the river and drain the lake were operational. Shortly after, debates between former residents, neighboring residents, and government agencies began on what to do with the dam created by the landslide; some wanted to make the lake permanent. The state engineer commissioned a study to determine if the landslide dam could be used to retain water; it recommended building a new dam upstream from the landslide, rather than attempting engineering work on the landslide dam. In the years following, the former residents of Thistle filed various lawsuits to recover their losses. In one, they claimed that their property was taken to rebuild the road and railroad without just compensation. Another lawsuit claimed negligence on the part of the D&RGW.; The residents argued that the railroad's maintenance workers knew the ground was unstable; however, they only repaired the track. The residents contended the slide could have been prevented by using a water drainage system to relieve pressure at the head of the unstable area. They further contended that such a system could have been put in place had the railroad thoroughly investigated the problem upon first noticing it. The engineering firm employed by the Rio Grande said that their studies indicated the crown of the landslide was about above the level of the tracks, and that the Rio Grande did not know the true size of the unstable area until the slide was in motion. A jury absolved the D&RGW; of responsibility. The plaintiffs appealed the decision, and a second trial in 1993 resulted in a $1.1 million award for the landowners (equivalent to $ million in ). The D&RGW; filed suit against the Utah Railway over sharing the costs from the landslide. The Utah Railway had an ownership interest in the line, based on a track-sharing agreement. Economic effects The Thistle landslide, as seen from a view area along US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89, June 2010 The landslide closed the main railroad for three months, and US‚Äë6 and US‚Äë89 for eight months, during which time transportation between the communities of eastern and southeastern Utah and the rest of the state was substantially impaired. Security for the isolated part of Utah County was temporarily assigned to the Utah Highway Patrol. The economic effects of the closure of these transportation arteries were felt throughout the western United States; the closure devastated rural Utah. The operations of coal mines, uranium mines, turkey farms, animal feed companies, gypsum mines, and cement and clay factories were severely impacted. At least two trucking firms and one oil- producing firm suspended or ceased operations. Southeastern Utah's tourism industry suffered without access for visitors from the north and west. Some people who lived and worked on opposite sides of the landslide area suddenly had commutes exceeding . The highway patrol temporarily closed a weigh station at Peerless (a location along the US‚Äë6 corridor near Helper) and built a temporary weigh station near Salina (along I‚Äë70 about south of Thistle), which saw a sudden increase in truck traffic. The highway patrol estimated the temporary facilities inspected 57,000 trucks and made 80 arrests. The direct cost of the landslide was estimated at $200 million (equivalent to $ million in ). However, some estimates of the total cost reached as high as $400 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The D&RGW; estimated the slide cost them $80 million in lost revenue (equivalent to $ million in ), averaging $1 million for each day that the tracks were out-of-service. This figure included $19 million in payments to the Union Pacific for the use of their lines. The United States Geological Survey and the state of Utah have called the Thistle landslide the most costly ever in the United States. Railroad East end of Union Pacific Railroad's tunnels that bypassed the landslide in Thistle, July 2015 To expedite construction, the railroad had crews in Utah focused on grading the new path and boring a tunnel, while crews in Colorado built track segments that were transported to site. On July 4, 1983, at 3:05 p.m., safety inspectors declared the line ready for operation. At 3:12 p.m., the centralized traffic control signals gave a green light to the first train to pass through the Thistle area since the slide began, an eastbound freight train coming from the Southern Pacific Railroad at Ogden, destined for Herington, Kansas. Although the line's re-opening on Independence Day was coincidental, the first train became part of the local holiday celebrations. The first passenger train to use the new alignment was the California Zephyr, on July 16. Debates ensued over the fate of the Marysvale Branch line. The mines at the end of the line had long closed; the last train to traverse the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed- out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line. alt=Map showing an area of Utah County circled and enlarged to the southeast of Utah Lake. The enlarged area shows an abandoned rail and highway grades to the west and south of replacement rail and highway grades. The residents of Richfield pressured the Rio Grande to use the portion of the line that was still intact and build a connection to an existing Union Pacific line (the Sharp Subdivision) near Nephi, roughly parallel to State Route 28. However, the railroad determined with the additional cost of acquiring land for the new right-of-way, the cost would be comparable to rebuilding the old route. In addition, the Rio Grande would have to pay trackage rights to the Union Pacific for the connection from Nephi, which would further erode profits on a line that was barely profitable. In the end, the Rio Grande sold the line to a scrap dealer who dismantled it. Since the line's closure, there have been multiple proposals to rebuild it. Studies note the loss of railroad access to the region has affected the ability of local industries to compete with producers in other regions that have rail access. A 2002 study placed the cost of rebuilding the modified routing of the Marysvale Branch line at $80 million, while a 2015 study placed the cost of rebuilding the line as far south as Salina at $110 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The 2015 study listed restoring rail access to the region as one of three priorities for new freight rail lines in a study presented by the Utah Department of Transportation detailing the current state of Utah's rail infrastructure. It specifically noted an increase of coal hauling trucks on highways and streets in the area due to the loss of rail access. Highways The new alignment of US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was planned for the next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had not seen since the slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as they were unable to disperse the crowds. When the first traffic flowed, crews had not finished some final tasks, such as striping the roadway. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, with a view of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass. The pending completion of the again- rebuilt US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89, with properly laid asphalt and stable rock cuts, was announced in November 1984, 18 months after the closure of the original alignment. Starting in 1993, the Utah Department of Transportation began discussions with former Thistle residents to build a memorial to the town. The department maintains a view area overlooking the townsite along US‚Äë6/US‚Äë89. =Coal Hollow fire= On August 4, 2018, a lightning bolt sparked a large fire in Spanish Fork Canyon. More than of land were destroyed by the fire. Residents of the canyon were evacuated as a precaution. The fire affected Thistle, extending construction projects. Later that year vandals burned one of the remaining homes to the ground. Geology and climate The landslide area near Thistle is a valley formed in a depression in an area of bedrock known as the Charleston‚ÄìNebo thrust plate. The rock in this plate dates from the Permian and Pennsylvanian to the Jurassic periods, but the plate appears to have formed elsewhere and moved to the modern Thistle area during the Late Cretaceous epoch. The layers of sedimentary rock above the thrust plate are younger, dating to the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. The rock debris in the landslide itself comes from the North Horn and Ankareh formations. The area around Thistle has always been prone to landslides. Pre-historic landslides created the more gentle slopes that made the area usable as a transportation corridor across the Wasatch Mountains. Minor landslides have been frequently observed, and continue to occur. The largest recorded landslides are the 1983 slide which destroyed the town, and a smaller one in 1998. The climate at downstream Spanish Fork is classified as arid with four distinct seasons. Temperatures range from an average high of in July and an average low of in January. Except for the spring months, precipitation averages less than per month.

Its capital city was called Suktimati in Sanskrit and Sotthivati-nagara in Pali. In Pali-language Buddhist texts, it is listed as one of the sixteen mahajanapadas (\\"great realms\\" of northern and central India). According to the Mahabharata, the Chedi Kingdom was ruled by Shishupala, an ally of Jarasandha of Magadha and Duryodhana of Kuru. He was a rival of Vasudeva Krishna who was his uncle's son. He was killed by Vasudeva Krishna during the Rajasuya sacrifice of the Pandava king Yudhishthira. Bhima's wife was from Chedi. Prominent Chedis during the Kurukshetra War included Damaghosha, Shishupala, Dhrishtaketu, Suketu, Sarabha, Bhima's wife, Nakula's wife Karenumati, Dhrishtaketu's sons. Other Chedis included King Uparichara Vasu, his children, King Suvahu, King Sahaja. It was ruled during early periods by Paurava kings and later by Yadava kings in the central part of the country. Geography The location of the capital city, Suktimati, has not been established with certainty. Historian Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri and F. E. Pargiter believed that it was in the vicinity of Banda, Uttar Pradesh. Archaeologist Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti has proposed that Suktimati can be identified as the ruins of a large early historical city, at a place with the modern-day name Itaha, on the outskirts of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.  Puranic History  The Chedi clan and kingdom was founded by Chidi, the son of Vidarbha and belonging to the Yadava dynasty. Chedi was later conquered and ruled by the Paurava King Vasu Uparichara, upon the order of Indra. Uparichara's descendant is Shishupala. = Chedi mentioned as a Kingdom of Ancient India (Bharata Varsha) = The Kuru-Panchalas, the Salwas, the Madreyas, the Jangalas, the Surasenas, the Kalingas, the Vodhas, the Mallas, the Matsyas, the Sauvalyas, the Kuntalas, the Kasi-Kosalas, the Chedis, the Karushas, the Bhojas...(6,9) Chedi was one among the kingdoms chosen for spending the 13th year of exile by the Pandavas. Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. (4,1) = King Uparichara Vasu and the festival of bamboo pole = Uparichara Vasu was a king of Chedi belonging to the Puru Dynasty. He was known as the friend of Indra. During his reign, Chedi kingdom had a good economic system and contained much mineral wealth, which made a lot of merchants around the world, come to the Kingdom. It was abundant in animals and corn. There were many towns and cities in the kingdom. He possessed a very special chariot. He introduced a festival in his kingdom in the honour of Indra. The festival involved planting of a bamboo pole every year, in honour of Indra. The king will then pray for the expansion of his cities and kingdom. After erecting the pole, people decked it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. From Chedi, he ruled a large territory, placing his sons as governors of various provinces. His son Vrihadratha (Maharatha) was installed in Magadha, who later fathered Emperor Jarasandha. His other sons, viz., Pratyagraha, Kusamva (Manivahana), Mavella and Yadu also became governors at various places. Thus the Chedi king attained the status of an emperor and his kingdom became a vast empire. He diverted the waters of river Suktimati from the locks of the Mountain Kolahala, for irrigating his capital-city which he named Suktimati. (1,63) *This beautiful city of the Chedis was called after the Oyster (14,83) His wife Girika, was from the valley of Kolahala. Girika's brother was installed as the generalissimo of Vasu's army. Apart from his five royal sons, he had a son and a daughter born of a woman of fisherman community. The male child, in due course established the Matsya Kingdom and founded the royal dynasty called Matsya Dynasty. The female child lived as a member of fishermen community. Her line established as fishermen on the banks of river Yamuna, in the kingdom of Kurus. The famous Kuru king Santanu's wife Satyavati was from this fishermen community. The author of MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, vis Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa and the Kuru kings viz Chitrangada and Vichitravirya were the sons of Satyavati. Pandavas and Kauravas were the grandsons of Vichitravirya.(1,63) *Another story connects Vasu with vegetarianism in ancient India. Filled with doubts respecting the propriety of eating flesh, some sages asked Uparichara Vasu for solving them. King Vasu, knowing that flesh is inedible, answered that it was edible. From that moment Vasu fell down from the firmament on the earth. After this he once more repeated his opinion, with the result that he had to sink below the earth for it. (13,115) *A similar story connects Vasu with the issue of animal sacrifices. In his opinion sacrifices could be performed with or without the slaughter of animals (14,91) = King Shishupala of Chedi = Shishupala was the malevolent son of the King Damaghosha (1,189). He had another name viz Sunitha. His mother was Shrutakirti, who was the sister of Kunti, the mother of Pandavas. Both Kunti and Shrutakirti were sisters of Vasudeva the father of Vasudeva Krishna. However Shishupala developed enmity with Krishna (2,44), though he was affectionate to the Pandava Bhima. During his military campaign to collect tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, Bhima stayed at the palace of Shishupala for a month as a guest. He also accepted Yudhishthira's sway over his kingdom and gave Bhima tribute (2,28). During the midst of Yudhishthira's Rajasuya ceremony, a dispute arose between Shishupala and Vasudeva Krishna. Pandavas tried to mediate. He also rebuked the Pandavas and Kuru grandsire Bhishma along with Krishna. Then Krishna, extremely provoked, decapitated Shishupala. (2,44). Shishupala's hostilities to Krishna were many. He burned the city of Dwaraka, while Krishna was in Pragjyotisha with his army. He attacked king Bhoja, sporting at Raivataka hill close to Dwaraka. He stole the horse of Krishna's father Prince Vasudeva of Mathura, during his horse-sacrifice. He insulted the wife of Akrura (Vabhru - the friend of Krishna), on her way from Dwaraka to Sauvira Kingdom. He kidnapped the princess of Visala, viz Bhadra, the fianc√© of Karusha king. (2,44) *Yudhishthira installed Shishupala's son in the throne of Chedi. (2,44) *Shishupala's sister was married to Bhima as per the reference in (15,25) = King Dhrishtaketu of Chedi = Dhrishtaketu, the king of Chedi (3,12), was described as the elder son of King Shishupala (5,50). During the time of Dhrishtaketu also, Suktimati was the capital of Chedi. Dhrishtaketu was an army-general in the army of Pandavas in Kurukshetra War. He was the leader of the army of the Chedis, the Kasis, and the Karushas (5,199). He was a Maharatha (a great car-warrior) as per the rating of Bhishma (5,172). One of his sons also took part in the war (5,57). He was slain by Drona (7,128), (11,25). Dhrishtaketu also was slain in battle by Drona. *Chedi Princess Karenumati was wedded to the Pandava Nakula, and prince Narimitra was their son. (1,95). It is not clear if she was Dhrishtaketu's sister. However it was mentioned that his sister was the wife of one of the Pandavas (3,22) (15,1). *Sarabha, the middle son of Shishupala became the king of Chedi after the death of Dhrishtaketu. He was killed in battle by Arjuna during his military campaign, after the Kurukshetra War. (14,83) * Mahipala, the youngest son of Shishupala killed in a blast done by Dussasana on 9th day of war. = Other Kings of Chedi = *King Subahu was described as the king of Chedi, during the time of Nishadha king Nala and Lord Rama . His wife, Damayanti the princess of Vidarbha, left alone in forest, met a caravan of traders heading towards Chedi. Along with them she reached the Chedi capital and lived as a servant maid of queen, in the palace of Chedi.

The history of quilting, the stitching together of layers of padding and fabric, may date back as far as 3400 BCE. For much of its history, quilting was primarily a practical technique to provide physical protection and insulation. However, decorative elements were often also present, and many quilts are now primarily art pieces. Europe Whole-cloth quilt, 18th century, Netherlands. Textile made in India. In Europe, quilting appears to have been introduced by Crusaders in the 12th century (Colby 1971) in the form of the aketon or gambeson, a quilted garment worn under armour which later developed into the doublet, which remained an essential part of fashionable men's clothing for 300 years until the early 1600s. One of the earliest existing decorative works is the Tristan Quilt, made around 1360 in Sicily. It is one of the earliest surviving quilts in the world and at least two sections survive, located at the V&A; Museum (London) and in Bargello palace (Florence). Another of the Tristan and Isolde story is held in a private collection. Russia The oldest surviving example of a quilted piece is a linen carpet found in a Mongolian cave, dated to between 100 BCE and 200 CE. It is now kept at the Saint Petersburg department of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Archaeology Section.  United Kingdom (and Tasmania)  The National Gallery of Australia has a quilt known as the Rajah Quilt. It was created by about 30 convict women as they were transported from Woolwich, England to Hobart, Tasmania in 1841. The quilt was rediscovered in Scotland in 1989. It is a medallion quilt with Broderie perse at its centre. United States Quilt making was common in the late 17th century and early years of the 18th century. Colonial quilts were not made of left over scraps or worn clothing as a humble bedcovering during this period. Instead, they were decorative items that displayed the fine needlework of the maker such as the Baltimore album quilts. Only the wealthy had the leisure time for quilt making, so such quilting was done by only a few. Commercial blankets or woven coverlets were a more economical bedcovering for most people. Whole cloth quilts, broderie perse and medallion quilts were the styles of quilts made during the early 19th century, but from 1840 onward the use of piecework and blocks, often made from printed fabric, became much more common. Quilting is now a popular hobby, with an estimated base of twenty-one million quilters. =Wholecloth quilts= Early wholecloth bed quilts which may appear to be a solid piece of fabric are actually composed of strips of fabric, since early looms could not produce widths of cloth large enough to cover an entire bed surface. Early quilts that feature the same fabric for the entire quilt top, whether that top is made of dyed wool or pieces of (the same) printed cotton fabric, are referred to as wholecloth quilts. Early wholecloth quilts have three layers: a quilt top, a filling (in early quilts the filler was often wool), and a backing. The three layers are held together via quilting stitches worked by hand, in an age before sewing machines were marketed. In wholecloth quilts, the quilting stitches themselves serve as the only decoration. The earliest whole cloth quilts found in America were brought from Europe. Initially, quilts were owned by the wealthy in America who had the means to purchase imported quilts. The collection of the Lovely Lane Museum in Baltimore, Maryland contains a quilt believed to have been carried onshore by the Cogswell family who embarked from Bristol, England en route to Bristol, Maine in 1635. Once the passengers were safely on shore, the galleon \\"Angel Gabriel\\", moored in Pemaquid Bay, was completely destroyed when the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 rushed up the coast from Naragansett, Rhode Island, leaving the ship as just a mass of floating debris after it was hit with the strongest winds ever recorded. The Canton Historical Society in Canton, Massachusetts believes that a wholecloth quilt in their collection may be the oldest wholecloth quilt made in America. The wool wholecloth quilt was made in 1786 by Martha Crafts Howard. The Buckingham Quilt surfaced in 2014. It was made by the wife of Reverend Thomas Buckingham, one of the founders of Yale University, and passed down through nine generations. It is among the oldest wholecloth quilts made in America (circa 1660s). A more complete survey is needed to compare all of the wholecloth quilts held in the many museum locations who have collected such textiles. Many early quilts did not survive the test of time or were discarded, or if they survived, the name of the quilter was lost to history. For a time, the trend in wholecloth quilting was a preference for all-cotton white quilts. Many of the beautiful surviving wholecloth quilts feature feather designs, outlines of flowers, or are based on other designs taken from nature motifs. Some were made even more exquisite by the use of stuffed and corded quilting, a method sometimes called trapunto. Trapunto is an Italian word used to describe the technique of slipping extra stuffing into certain areas of a quilt to create areas of raised motifs that stand in relief. For example, stuffing placed inside the quilted outline of a feather or flower makes the design stands out. Women were sometimes proud of their finely wrought and evenly spaced quilting stitches in their wholecloth quilts. This type of quilting seems to be experiencing a revival today and some quilt stores sell pre-marked quilt tops ready to be layered and quilted, either by hand or by machine. =Broderie perse quilts= Broderie perse refers to the technique of cutting motifs from printed fabric and appliqu√©ing them onto a solid background. This form of quilt making has been done since the 18th century. The popular printed fabric during this period was chintz imported from India. Printed fabric was expensive even for those who were well off. By cutting out birds, flowers and other motifs from printed fabric and sewing them onto a large homespun cloth, a beautiful bedspread could be made. The technique was also used on some early medallion quilts as in the example. Broderie perse bedcoverings were usually used on the best bed or sometimes only when guests were staying in the home. =Medallion quilts= Example of a medallion quilt with applique. Elizabeth Welsh. Medallion Quilt, c. 1830. Cotton. Brooklyn Museum Medallion quilts are made around a center. The center was sometimes a solid piece of large-scale fabric like a toile or a Tree of Life, an appliqued motif or a large pieced star or other pieced pattern. The central area was surrounded by two or more borders. Although some borders were solid, many were pieced or appliqued. =Mid-19th century= Changes came about as progress in technology deeply affected the number and styles of quilts made during the middle years of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution brought about the most dramatic change as textiles came to be manufactured on a broad scale. This meant women no longer had to spend time spinning and weaving to provide fabric for their family's needs. By the 1840s the textile industry had grown to the point that commercial fabrics were affordable to almost every family. As a result, quilt making became widespread. A great variety of cotton prints could be bought to make clothing and even specifically for making a quilt. Although scraps left over from dressmaking and other sewing projects were used in quilt making, it is a myth that quilts were always made from scraps and worn-out clothing. Examining pictures of quilts found in museums we quickly see that many quilts were made with fabric bought specifically for that quilt. Another major shift was in the style of quilts made. Although a few earlier quilts were made in the block style, quilts made up of blocks were uncommon until around the 1840s. With so many fabrics being manufactured quilters could create their blocks with a delightful variety of fabrics. Some block style quilts were made of a set of identical pieced blocks while others contained a variety of blocks made with different patterns. The blocks were sewn together and a border may or may not have been added. During this period the invention and availability of the sewing machine contributed to quilt making. In 1856, the Singer company started an installment plan so that more families could afford a sewing machine. By the 1870s, many households owned a sewing machine. This affected quilt making in two ways. First of all, women could make clothing for their family in much less time, which left more time for quilt making. Secondly, they could use their sewing machines to make all or part of their quilts. The sewing machine was usually used to piece quilts, but occasionally the quilting itself was done with the sewing machine. =Civil War era= Oak Leaf Variant applique quilt, c. 1860, cottons, made by Mrs. M.E. Poyner, Paducah, Kentucky, dimensions: 74\\" x 86\\".

Collection of Bill Volckening, Portland, Oregon. Leading up to the American Civil War, quilts were made to raise funds to support the abolitionist movement then during the war, quilts were made to raise funds for the war effort and to give warmth and comfort to soldiers. The patterns were much like those made mid-century but the purpose was different. Quilts connected to the abolitionist movement and the Civil War were made for a cause, many representing the relevant flag. Abolition and the role of quilts Even before 1830, abolitionists were working hard to end slavery. One way they did this was to hold grand fairs to raise both awareness and money for the abolitionist cause. Quilts were one of many craft pieces sold at these fairs. These quilts were usually fine quilts often with beautiful appliqu√©. Women sometimes put anti-slavery poems and sayings on the quilts they made for fairs as well as for friends and family. The goal was to show the terrible plight of the slaves. Some abolitionists were active along the Underground Railroad and helped runaway slaves get to safety. There are stories that certain quilts were used as signals to help slaves in their flight to freedom. For example, a log cabin quilt might be hung on the line of a safe house. However, historians dispute the accuracy of these stories. For the troops Civil War soldier's quilt. Women on both sides were very active in raising money for the war effort and making quilts and other bed coverings for soldiers. In the North, quilts were still made for fairs but now these fairs earned money to support needs that came about because of the war. In the South, \\"gunboat\\" quilts were made to pay for much-needed gunboats. It wasn't long before it was obvious that soldiers on both sides would need blankets and quilts for warmth. In the North, women either made quilts or remade quilts from bed coverings. Since the cots were narrow, two bedspreads could be made into three quilts for soldiers. The United States Sanitary Commission was in charge of collecting distributing them. In the South, quilt- making was more difficult because although cotton was grown in the south, it was manufactured into fabric in the north. Before long, fabric was almost impossible to obtain so women had to spin and weave before they could sew a bed covering together. Regardless of their construction, most of the quilts made for soldiers on either side were made with practical patterns and fabric. Due to heavy use, very few have survived to the 21st century. =Victorian era America= Quilt making continued to be a popular craft during the latter part of the 19th century. The English Victorian influence was slightly delayed in the United States because of the Civil War and its aftermath. =Amish quilting= Amish quilts are appreciated for their bold graphic designs, distinctive colour combinations, and exceptional stitching. Quilting became a favoured activity of the Anabaptist sect after emigrating to the United States and Canada from Germany and Switzerland over 250 years ago. The earliest known Amish quilts, dating from 1849, are whole-cloth works in solid colours. Pattern-pieced bed coverings didn't appear until the 1870s. Particular patterns and fabrics are identified with specific Amish communities; for example, pre-1940s quilts from Lancaster County were almost always made of wool while those sewn in Ohio during the same period were commonly made of cotton.Levie, Eleanor; Place, Jennifer; Sehafer Sears, Mary (1992). Country Livings Country Quilts. New York: Hearst Books. p. 98. . Often these quilts provide the only decoration in a simply furnished home and they also were commonly used for company or to show wealth. Amish religion discourages individual expression but quiltmaking has allowed Amish women to express their creative natures without giving offence. The Amish communities have always encouraged activities that promote community and family closeness so quilting became a fundamental part of social life for the women of the community. Quilts are created for everyday use or to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, raising funds for the church or community cause. Since the \\"English\\" (the name for non-Amish people) discovered Amish work in the late 1960s, quilting has become a source of income for many. Their quilts have become collectors' items all over the world. =Crazy quilting fad= In terms of quilts the latter years of the 19th century is best remembered for the \\"Crazy quilting\\" craze. Crazy quilts were made of abstract shapes sewn randomly together. Usually the quilt maker then used embroidery to embellish the quilt. Fancy stitches were sewn along the seams and often, embroidered motifs were added, including flowers, birds and sometimes a spider and web for good luck. Magazines encouraged making \\"crazies\\". These simple, organic quilts were seldom used as bed-coverings, instead they were made smaller and without batting to be used as decorative throws. =Traditional quilt survival= Because crazy quilting was so popular at the time, they tend to eclipse the fact that many traditional quilts were also made for bedding and commemoration. Utilitarian quilts were pieced and tied or simply quilted for everyday bed coverings while beautiful pieced and/or appliqu√©d quilts were created for special events like a wedding or when a beloved minister was transferred to a new location. These were more often elaborately quilted. In the 1940s and 1950s many farm feeds were delivered in sacks. These sacks were printed with all sorts of designs. Feed sacks were used to make thousands of quilts.Personal Experiences. =Contemporary quilts= Contemporary quilting has evolved to include a broad range of functional, decorative and artistic styles that incorporate ever-expanding techniques and tools. Many quilters have experimented with creating or dyeing their own fabrics, incorporating experimental materials into their designs and conceptually challenging the notion of what quilting is or should be. Advances in technology such as long- arm quilting machines and computer programs for mapping quilt top patterns and colour schemes has significantly widened the gap between contemporary and traditional quilting. There is currently a thriving resurgence in quilting. Thousands of videos of quilting techniques and tutorials have been made and shared online by people from around the world, continuing the tradition of quilting as a social and artistic space where people have connected over countless generations See also * Duvet * List of quilters * NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt * Patchwork quilt * Quilt art * Razai * Southern AIDS Living Quilt * Tessellation References Further reading =Primary sources= * =Books=  =Articles=  External links * Baltimore Album quilts at the Maryland Historical Society * The American Quilt Study Group * America's Quilting History * New Pathways Into Quilt History * Quilt History * The Quilt Index * Quilt Study Groups * Quilter's Muse Publications * The Buckingham Quilt Quilting quilting ","title":"History of quilting"},{"id":"4327354","text":"Baby Burlesks is the collective series title of eight thematically unrelated one-reeler Pre-Code films produced by Jack Hays and directed by Charles Lamont for Educational Pictures in 1931, 1932 and 1933.

The 10-minute film stars Temple as Madam Cradlebait, a missionary and captive of jungle savages rescued from the cooking pot by a Tarzan-like character called Diaperzan (Danny Boone, Jr.), who arrives on the back of an elephant. The script required Temple to take a ride in an ostrich-drawn cart but the frightened bird bolted and Temple came close to being killed.Edwards, p. 39 A group of black children playing savages were directed to run and fall en masse when shot by arrows from the good guys. Unbeknownst to the children, a piano wire was strung shin-high in their path and they fell into a yowling heap, some with bleeding shins.Black, p. 26 The film was the most tasteless in the series, and, with its release, the series was discontinued.Edwards, p. 38 The film strangely includes an advertisement for Ex-Lax, a sign for which appears on a post in front of the Hotel \\"Squaldorf\\".Shirley Temple Classics DVD, Audiovision Canada, 2008.

He joined his brothers in the Mezzogiorno around 1053, arriving with his half-brothers Mauger and William. He was certainly present at the Battle of Civitate in that year. In that year, Humphrey, his brother the count of Apulia, gave Mauger and William the Capitanate and the Principate, respectively, with the title of count. When Mauger died later that decade (in 1054, according to Goffredo Malaterra), the county passed to William, who gave it to Geoffrey. In 1059, his brother Robert Guiscard, Humphrey's successor over Geoffrey, who was older, but had not been in the south as long, helped him quell a revolt in the Capitanate. He also ruled the region around Loritello, where his son Robert was invested as count, and he expanded his domains into those of the pope, conquering Gissi in the Abruzzi. His death is a matter of confusion. The Breve Chronicon Northmannicum states, on the authority of Goffredo Malaterra, that he died in 1063, but the chronicler apparently confused the many Geoffreys of the period. He probably died circa 1071. He had been married in Normandy and he had three sons from that union: the aforementioned Robert; Ralph, who inherited Catanzaro; and William, who inherited Tiriolo. In the Mezzogiorno, he married, like his eldest brother William Iron Arm, a niece of the Prince Guaimar IV of Salerno, Theodora of Capaccio, daughter of Pandulf, lord of Capaccio, Guaimar's brother. From this second marriage was born at least one son, named Tancred, who was alive in 1103 and 1104. He also had a son, of unknown parentage, named Drogo or Tasso . Sources *Chalandon, Ferdinand.

Background After he grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania, he attended Salem University in West Virginia and Temple University in Philadelphia where he studied radio, television, and film. Like many popular weather anchors, he serves as a weather reporter rather than a meteorologist as he doesn't have a degree in meteorology. He worked as a comedian and disc jockey for several years and as a radio personality at WBEN and later WKBW in Buffalo, New York. He left Buffalo for Los Angeles in 1980 to work as a stand- up comic. In 1982 he began work as weekend weatherman at KNBC and became the weekday weatherman in 1984. He has written and performed two one-man theater acts, titled The Reception and It's Me! Dad! He received the 2004 EMA Community Service Award for his involvement with KNBC's 4 Our Planet, a children's program. He appeared in a supporting role in one of Raymond Burr's last Perry Mason television films, The Case of the Telltale Talk Show Host, in 1993. He received a \\"thanks\\" credit on the film Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie, an \\"alternate film\\" companion to Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.* From 2009 to 2011, Coleman also did the weekday weather (in addition to KNBC) for San Diego's NBC affiliate, KNSD. On June 17, 2020, Coleman announced that he would retire on Friday, June 26 after almost 40 years at KNBC.

Houghton left high school during his fifth form year with an intention to expand the family farm. However, after a personal religious experience, he left the farm, trained for two years (1960‚Äì61) at the Bible College of New Zealand, and became the first NZ missionary sent out by the then Oriental Missionary Society (now One Mission Society), a multinational Christian faith mission, a multinational Christian evangelism organization. He arrived in India to do village evangelism in 1965 and has worked in that country until 2005. Houghton completed undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, eventually earning his Ph.D. in South Asian History from the University of California, Los Angeles with a dissertation titled \\"The Impoverishment of Dependency.\\" His wife Carol moved (n√©e, McDearmid) from Virginia in the United States at an early age with her parents, who were Assemblies of God missionaries. She has lived in India almost continuously since, with the exception of her university education. Her marriage to Houghton in 1968 was arranged according to Indian custom by her father. Houghton taught for many years as well as serving as the Principal of Madras Bible Seminary before founding SAIACS in 1981. The SAIACS campus now occupies almost five hectares (twelve acres) of land on the North edge of Bangalore, a fast-growing city of over 8 million, just over 300 km west of Chennai (Madras) in South India. SAIACS has now expanded to a total of about 130 full-time students, all studying at the masters or doctoral level. Students come from many parts of India, and other nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Sri Lanka, Thailand, and also Australia and New Zealand. Several have come from Africa and Central America. In the past year a number of Indian Students from the United States have also chosen to come to SAIACS in preparation for working in the sub-continent. In 1997 SAIACS was recognized by the University of Mysore as an accredited research institution to the university, enabling SAIACS to offer an accredited Indian Ph.D. programme. This is the first Protestant institution to be so recognized since William Carey's Serampore College in 1818. SAIACS graduates are working as organizational and denominational leaders, faculty at a number of bible colleges, seminaries, and graduate schools, and pastors and missionaries with many indigenous missionary agencies throughout South Asia. In 2001 Dr. Houghton was invited as a part of a group to establish a department of Christianity at Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China. Teaching at the masters and Ph.D. level has been going on since then. The courses have reached both Christians from the Three Self Patriotic Church and other Christian groups as well as non-Christian students. As of February 2012, upwards of 100 are enrolled with more than 700 having completed the classes offered. After Houghton's formal handing over of the SAIACS principalship in 2005, he and his wife moved to Cambridge, New Zealand. Houghton is still active in teaching and mentoring, especially in the Peking University Project. References His book, Christian Leadership for Building the Church and Building the Nation, SAIACS Press, 2010 has been widely influential.

Dasarna Kingdom was one of the many kingdoms ruled by Yadava kings in ancient central and western India. It lay to the south of the Chedi and Panchala kingdoms, in northern Madhya Pradesh. The Panchala prince Sikhandi married a princess from Dasarna. Sikhandin was alleged to be 'one of the neuter-gender'. This led to a dispute between the Dasarna king and the Panchala king Drupada. There was another Dasarna Kingdom in the western regions along with the Sivis, Trigartas, Western-Malavas and Amvasthas. (2,31), in the Punjab province of Pakisthan.  References in Mahabharata  = Dasarna, a kingdom in Bharata Varsha = Dasarna is listed in the list of kingdoms of Bharata Varsha (ancient India). The Kuru-Panchalas, the Salwas, the Madreyas, the Jangalas, the Surasena, the Kalingas, the Vodhas, the Malas, the Matsyas, the Sauvalyas, the Kuntalas, the Kasi-kosalas, the Chedis, the Karushas, the Bhojas, the Sindhus, the Pulindakas, the Uttamas, the Dasarnas, the Mekalas, the Utkalas; the Panchalas, the Kausijas ... (6,9) Chedi was one among the kingdoms chosen for spending the 13th year of exile by the Pandavas. Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. (4,1) = Pandava's travel from Dwaita forest to Matsya Kingdom = Leaving Dwaita woods Pandavas moved (eastwards) towards river Yamuna, passing through many hills and forests. Terminating their forest life they proceeded (southwards) to the southern bank of Yamuna. By killing the deer of the forest, they passed through Yakrilloma and Surasena, (they turned westwards), leaving behind them, on their right the country of the Panchalas and to their left the Dasarnas. Finally they entered the Matsya territory, leaving the forest. The city of Virata was still far away. The passage below, describes the locations of various ancient kingdoms. This gives a vague idea that Dasarna lied west to Panchala Kingdom = Dasarna King Sudaman = Dasarna king Sudaman had two daughters. One was married to Chedi king Viravahu (Suvahu). The other one was married to Vidarbha king Bhima. The famous princess Damayanti was the daughter of this Vidarbha king Bhima. (3,69) = Dasarna King Sudharman defeated by Pandava Bhima = Pandava Bhima, during his military campaigns for collecting tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, reached Dasarna Kingdom Bhima then subjugated the Dasarnas. There in the country of the Dasarnas, the king called Sudharman with his bare arms fought a fierce battle with Bhimasena. And Bhimasena, beholding that feat of the illustrious king, appointed the mighty Sudharman as the first in command of his forces. (2,28) = Western Dasarnas defeated by Pandava Nakula = Pandava Nakula, during his military campaigns for collecting tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, reached the western Dasarna Kingdom In the western region, Nakula subjugated the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Amvashtas, the Malavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, and those twice born classes that were called the Madhyamakeyas and Vattadhanas. (2,31) = Dasarna king Hiranyavarman = King Hiranyavarman possessed a large army. He had a beautiful daughter. Panchala king Drupada chose this Dasarna princess as the wife of their son Sikhandi, who was born as a female, but brought up as a man. When the secret was out regarding the true sex of Sikhandi, a war broke between Dasarnas and Panchalas. Hiranyavarman ordered his army to sack Kampilya (Kampil in Uttar Pradesh), the capital city of Panchalas.(5-192,193). King Drupada‚Äôs city was naturally well-protected. Yet at the advent of danger, O monarch, they began to protect it all the more carefully and fortify it with defensive works. (5,194) Sikhandi, wished to die, and went to the forest of a Yaksha named Sthunakarna, who will kill any intruder into that forest. Within the forest stood his mansion with high walls and a gateway, plastered over with powdered earth, and rich with smoke bearing the fragrance of fried paddy. Entering that mansion, Sikhandi fasted for many days, to die. The Yaksha, out of kindness, converted Sikhandi into a male. He returned to his kingdom and ended the dispute between the Dasarnas and Pachalas. (5-194,195) *King Hiranyavarman was mentioned as the brother of Drupada :- Drupada's words:- My powerful brother, king Hiranyavarman, having mustered a large force, is coming towards me in anger.(5,193) = Dasarnas in Kurukshetra War =  On Pandava side  *Dasarna king took part in the Kurukshetra War on the side of Pandavas.

After conquering the Kasis, the Angas, the Kosalas, the Kiratas, and the Tanganas, Arjuna reached the country of the Dasarnas. The ruler of that people was Chitrangada. Between him and Arjuna occurred a battle exceedingly terrible. Bringing him under his sway Arjuna proceeded to the dominions of the Nishada king, viz., the son of Ekalavya.

He was the lead designer of the famed PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ medium bomber. DƒÖbrowski was born in Niebor√≥w, west of Warsaw to a railway clerk family. He studied architecture and then transferred to mechanical engineering at the Warsaw Technical University (Polytechnic). The department offered aviation speciality and had an aviation fan club. DƒÖbrowski designed and built his first aircraft, biplane ultralight D.1 Cykacz (Ticker) in 1924 at the Centralne Warsztaty Lotnicze (Central Aviation Workshops) in Warsaw. In 1925 DƒÖbrowski obtained a special permission to complete pilot training at the 1st Air Regiment. Due to financial difficulties Jerzy left the Polytechnic in 1926 and started working at the Plage & Laskiewicz company contributing to the design of the Lublin R.VIII, R.IX. and DUS-III. In 1928 he was asked to join the PZL aviation works in Warsaw. There, with Dr. Franciszek Misztal he designed the all-metal PZL.19 and the PZL.26 for the Challenge 1932 and Challenge 1934 contests. DƒÖbrowski's greatest achievement was the design of a very advanced medium bomber PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ, even though he had not worked on an airplane of this type and size. PZL submitted a proposal in response to the specification issued by the Departament Aeronautyki (Department of Aeronautics) in 1934 for a twin motor bomber capable of carrying a load of 2000 kg (including 300 kg bombs) with speed in excess of 350 km/h and a range of 1200 km. DƒÖbrowski's preliminary design won an internal PZL contest for the new plane and in the fall of 1934 DƒÖbrowski became chief engineer of the project. The all-metal aircraft with a large elliptical wing and aerodynamically profiled fuselage had superb flying qualities. The requirement to cary bombs in the wing resulted in the development of an elongated aerodynamic cross-section with excellent qualities, later identified as a laminar flow airfoil. The PZL.37 could carry more than 5000 lb of bombs (2500 kg) over a distance of 900 miles (1500 km) and 2200 lb (1000 kg) over 1400 miles (2200 km - to Moscow and back?), however the Polish Air Force did not have a clear philosophy for the use of such plane. Over 100 were produced by the outbreak of World War II, the last few being the first aircraft manufactured at the new Mielec plant in southern Poland. Only 36 ≈Åo≈õ' were in active bomber units before the Invasion of Poland. A further 18 were in reserve at the Ma≈Çaszewicze base and a dozen in training. The remainder of the aircraft was being finished slowly at the PZL factories in Warsaw and Mielec, with the main emphasis shifting to the production of fighters. During that time DƒÖbrowski designed a very promising low-wing fighter with inline engine, PZL.62, but the war prevented its development. During the World War II DƒÖbrowski was evacuated to Romania and then to England where he was a technical officer with the Polish Air Force. After the war ended he completed his degree, worked at Percival Aircraft and Folland Aviation. In 1955 he moved to the United States working initially at the Cessna Aircraft Co., then Stanley Aviation and finally Boeing where he specialized in advanced studies. He died while working in Renton, Washington on September 17, 1967.  References  1. Jerzy B.

Avanti was divided into north and south by river Vetravati. Initially, Mahissati (Sanskrit Mahishamati) was the capital of Southern Avanti, and Ujjaini (Sanskrit Ujjayini) was of northern Avanti, but at the times of Mahavira and Buddha, Ujjaini was the capital of integrated Avanti. The country of Avanti roughly corresponded to modern Malwa, Nimar and adjoining parts of the Madhya Pradesh. Both Mahishmati and Ujjaini stood on the southern high road called Dakshinapatha extending from Rajagriha to Pratishthana (modern Paithan). Avanti was an important center of Buddhism and some of the leading theras and theris were born and resided there. King Nandivardhana of Avanti was defeated by king Shishunaga of Magadha. Avanti later became part of Magadhan empire.

These many roads lead to the southern country, passing by (the city of) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty mountain called Vindhya ; yon, the river Payasvini running seawards, and yonder are the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots. This road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas ‚Äîand that, to the country of the Kosalas. Beyond these roads to the south is the southern country. (3,61) = Sahadeva's Conquests = Allying himself with the vanquished tribes the Pandava Sahadeva then marched towards the countries that lay on the banks of the Narmada. And defeating there in battle the two heroic kings of Avanti, called Vinda and Anuvinda, supported by a mighty host, the mighty son of the twin gods exacted much wealth from them. After this the hero marched towards the town of Bhojakata. (2,30) = Karna's conquests = Then going to Shishupala's son, the son of the Suta defeated him and that highly powerful one also brought under his sway all the neighbouring rulers. And having subjugated the Avantis and concluded peace with them, and having met with the Vrishnis, he conquered the west.

These two heroes among men will consume the troops of thy foes, with maces and bearded darts, and swords and long shafts, and javelins hurled from their hands. Like a couple of (elephant) leaders sporting in the midst of their herds, these two princes longing for battle, will range the field, each like Yama himself.

In some cases the ceremony is for spiritual cleansing or blessing, but the purposes and particulars of the ceremonies, and the substances used, can vary widely between tribes, bands and nations. The rite of smudging has been used by others outside of the Indigenous community as well and is a misnomer that it was only used by the American Indigenous Peoples. The practice of smudging has been used by multiple cultures from the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks to the Roman Catholic Church and Romani People to name a few. Native American traditions In some First Nations and Native American ceremonies, certain herbs are traditionally used to purify or bless people and places. For instance, some cultures use the smoke of burning red cedar as part of their particular purification and healing ceremonies. Sometimes this is done in hospitals to \\"cleanse and repel evil influence.\\" However, the same herbs that are burned by one culture may be taboo to burn in another, or they may be used for a completely different purpose. When specific herbs are burned ceremonially, this may or may not be called \\"smudging\\", depending on the culture. Traditionally, when gathering herbs for ceremonial use, care is taken to determine the time of day, month, or year when the herbs should be collected; for example, at dawn or evening, at certain phases of the moon, or according to yearly cycles. Gertrude Allen, a Lumbee, reported that her father, an expert in healing with plants, stated that sage varies in potency at different times of the year.Boughman, A. L., & Oxendine, L. O. (2003). Herbal remedies of the Lumbee Indians. Jefferson, N.C., McFarland. While sage is commonly associated with smudging and several Native American or FNIM cultures may use forms of sage (for example, common sage or white sage) that are local to their region, the use of sage is neither universal, nor as widespread as was once commonly believed. Likewise, not all Native American or First Nations, Inuit or M√©tis (FNIM) cultures that burn herbs or resins for ceremony call this practice ‚Äúsmudging.‚Äù While using various forms of scent and scented smoke (such as incense) in religious and spiritual rites is an element common to many different cultures worldwide, the details, reasons, desired effects, and spiritual meanings are usually unique to the specific cultures in question.Hobson, G. \\"The Rise of the White Shaman as a New Version of Cultural Imperialism\\" in: Hobson, G., ed. The Remembered Earth. Albuquerque, NM: Red Earth Press; 1978: 100-108.Aldred, Lisa, \\"Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality\\" in: The American Indian Quarterly issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352. The University of Nebraska Press. Controversy Some of the terminology in use among non- Indigenous people, such as the American English term \\"smudge stick\\" is usually found in use among those who imitate what they believe are Native American sacred ceremonies. However, the herbs used in commercial \\"smudge sticks\\" or \\"sage bundles,\\" and the rituals performed with them by non-Natives, are rarely the actual materials or ceremonies used by traditional Native Americans. Use of these objects have also been adopted in some forms into a number of modern belief systems, including many forms of New Age and eclectic Neopagan spirituality. This has been protested against by Native activists as a form of cultural misappropriation, and care is needed to distinguish smudging from other practices involving smoke. Smudging \\"kits\\" are often sold commercially, despite traditional prohibitions against the sale of spiritual medicines like white sage. These may include bundles of a single herb or a combination of several different herbs; often these herbs are not found bundled together in traditional use, and their use is not universal to all, or even most, Native cultures. In some Native American cultures the burning of these herbs is prohibited. Other commercial items may contain herbs not native to North America, or not indigenous to the region where they are being used, as well as substances that are toxic when burnt. Native American students in college dorms have at times faced harassment and been forbidden from burning herbs for ceremonial reasons due to university fire prevention policies that prohibit the burning of candles or incense in college dorm rooms. This has raised issues around the religious freedom of Native Americans. Stokes, DaShanne. 2001. \\"Sage, Sweetgrass, and the First Amendment.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, May 18, pp. B16. In another account, a Native American in Cincinnati became ordained by the Universal Life Church in order to fulfill the requirement that only clergy members could perform smudging ceremonies as part of the prayer ritual for other Native Americans in area hospitals.Lauren Bishop, Ordained for the Occasion, The Cincinnati Enquirer (April 14, 2007), p.

The village is mostly covered with coconut palms and cashew trees. Its western side edges the Arabian sea, while the east is separated by Parvathi Puthanar, a manmade canal completed during the time of Regent Sethu Lakshmi Bhai of Travancore Kingdom. Access to National Highway (NH 66) and a railway station is as short as and the VSSC of the Indian Space Research Organisation is close by. There are two man made hills ‚Äî one on the south (Thekkekkunnu)and the other on the north (Vadakkekkunnu), which are believed to have been made during the time of Portuguese. Famous Malayalam Cine Artist Allenciar Ley Lopez hails from Puthenthope. History There is little written historical record of Puthenthope's development but a strong oral tradition. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were looking for a strategic point to place their cannons, aiming at the Dutch ship movements in the Arabian Sea. They found a suitable place with tall coconut palms on the coastal area and dense forest throughout the inland. If they could build hills in between and place the cannons there, the ships could not see it but the people in the land could easily monitor. So to build the hills, Portuguese brought a group of Kusavans (potters) from Ambalappuzha, a place in the present Alappuzha district. They made the hills for the cannons to be placed. The Kusavans who came from Amplapuzha stayed back and continued with their occupation of pot making. The occupation of pot making was not suitable for many reasons‚Äìthe unavailability of clay, the long walk through the forest to the nearest market, presence of notorious thieves on the forest way etc. They turned to another profitable occupation‚Äìfishing. A journey through the coastal lines of Thiruvananthapuram reveals that there are no historical landmark sites as old as the Puthenthope mounds. The Portuguese influence can also be seen in the language spoken here. However, the Ambalapuzha link remained a mystery till the excavation of sand mounds in the late 1970s. During excavations, huge quantities of earthenware, believed to be used by the then people were discovered. St. Francis Xavier came to India in the early 16th century and walked through the western coast of India preaching Christianity and converting people to Christianity. There is a strong assumption that he placed a cross near Njaramukham (Old name of Puthenthope) and prayed (present Pallimukku area). There is another belief that St. Francis heard about the death of his teacher St. Ignatius Loyola while he was near Njanramukham and so he placed the cross in his name. There is a common belief that, some ladies from the family of the famous Ettuveettil Pillai, the Kazhakuttam Pillai, was given to the Mukkuva's of the area, after he being executed by Marthanda Varma. There are conflicting references but the most reliable historical reference points that these ladies from the eight families (ettu veedu) were gathered together and given to the mukkuva's on the northern border of Travancore kingdom, far away from the capital ‚Äì a coastal area in the present Kayamkulam Taluk. Fishing, once, might have been a profitable venture. The two pandakashalas, built close to the seashore, one near the Church and the other at Njaramugham, for processing and storing fish, have disappeared, but their remains account for the then flourishing fish trade. During the heyday, people had established trade relations with Ceylon. The British East India Company had started its industrial expansions in Malaya and turning Singapore into a flourishing free port by the dawn of the 19th century and there was a big flow of human resources from China and India to these areas. That might have been a possible reason for Puthenthopians‚Äô first journey out from his secluded land. Malaya and Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1941 and the Puthenthopinas who joined INA might have been those who were already in Singapore, rather than they going out from Puthenthope to join INA (INA was supported by Japan ‚Äì it was not easy to join INA in British India and British Singapore). It was during the Second World War that our people joined British army as koolipattalam. The traveling of Puthenthopians to other parts of the world was purely on job hunt rather than any other social inevitability. Many people from Puthenthope have traveled to Malaysia and Singapore before and after the Second World War. It might have been from there that some Puthenthopians moved on to England, after the independence of these countries in 1957. British must have allowed some of their civil servants to accompany them on their withdrawal (a possible reason).

It was founded by a grandson of Vaivasvata, inter alia the father of the present Manu and of Yama, named Anartha. He built a fortress at Kusasthali (Dvaraka), which was later flooded by Varuna. The place remained then for some time as a forest land, before Krishna and the Yadavas went there and built Dvaraka.Vettam Mani: Puranic Encyclopaedia, 9th reprint Dehli 2010, page 89 It was then ruled by Yadavas after they fled from Mathura of Surasena Kingdom, due to the attacks of Jarasandha, the king of Magadha. The Yadava chiefs like Vasudeva Krishna, Bala Rama (brother of Krishna), Kritavarma and Satyaki, ruled this kingdom under their king Ugrasena. In Mahabharata, Dwaraka is considered as a capital city of Anarta Kingdom. But some other ancient texts like Mahabhagavata, mentions Dwaraka and Anarta as two independent kingdoms. As per the Purana viz. Bhagavata Purana, Bala Rama's wife Revati was from this kingdom. Other Yadava kingdoms in west-central India include: #Chedi (Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh) #Surasena (Mathura district in Uttar Pradesh (also known as Vraja) #Dasarna (south to Chedi Kingdom) #Karusha (east to Dasarna Kingdom) #Kunti (North to Avanti Kingdom) #Avanti (Ujjain district in Madhya Pradesh #Malava (West to Avanti Kingdom) #Gurjara (southern Rajasthan) #Heheya (Narmada valley around the city Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh) #Saurashtra (southern Gujarat) #Dwaraka (offshore the Dwarka city in Gujarat) #Vidarbha. (north eastern Maharashtra)  References in Mahabharata  = Draupadi's sons in Anarta country undergoes military training = Mahabharata 3.182 When Pandavas were exiled to the woods, by the Kauravas, the five sons of Pandavas, born to Draupadi, were sent to Panchala, the kingdom ruled by their maternal grandfather Drupada. They later went to the Anarta Kingdom, ruled by the Yadavas, so that they can stay with their step brother and dear friend, Abhimanyu, and learn military science from eminent Yadava warriors. Vasudeva Krishna's words to Princess Krishna (alias Draupadi, Panchali):- Those sons of yours, are devoted to the study of the science of arms, are well-behaved and conduct themselves on the pattern of their righteous friends. Your father and your uterine brothers proffer them a kingdom and territories; but the boys find no joy in the house of Drupada, or in that of their maternal uncles. Safely proceeding to the land of the Anartas, they take the greatest delight in the study of the science of arms. Your sons enter the town of the Vrishnis (Dwaraka) and take an immediate liking to the people there. And as you would direct them to conduct themselves, or as the respected Kunti would do, so does Subhadra (their stepmother) direct them in a watchful way. Perhaps, she is still more careful of them. As Pradyumna is the preceptor of Aniruddha, of Abhimanyu, of Sunitha, and of Bhanu; so he is the preceptor and the refuge of your sons also! And a good preceptor, would unceasingly give them lessons in the wielding of maces and swords and bucklers, in missiles and in the arts of driving cars and of riding horses, being valiant. And he, Pradyumna, the son of Rukmini, having bestowed a very good training upon them, and having taught them the art of using various weapons in a proper way, takes satisfaction at the valorous deeds of your sons, and of Abhimanyu. O daughter of Drupada! And when your son goes out, in pursuit of (out-door) sports, each one of them is followed thither by cars and horses and vehicles and elephants.‚Äô Vasudeva Krishna, next told to the exiled Pandava king Yudhishthira, that the fighting men of Anarta, consisting of Satwata, Dasarha, Kukura, Adhaka, Bhoja, Vrishni and Madhu tribes will be kept ready to overthrow the enemies of Pandavas, viz the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana, ruling the Kuru city Hastinapura. Bala Rama, with plough as his weapon, will lead the warriors consisting of bowmen, horsemen, foot-soldiers, cars and elephants. In the fifth book, Chapter 83 of Mahabharata (MBh 5.83), it is mentioned that Pandava's mother Kunti also stayed for some time in Anarta, during the exile of the Pandavas. = Pandava's cousins from Anarta join them at Upaplavya = Mahabharata 4.72 After the expiry of the thirteenth year, the five Pandavas took up their abode in one of Virata‚Äôs towns called Upaplavya. Arjuna brought over Abhimanyu and Vasudeva Krishna, and also many people of the Dasarha race from the Anarta country. = Both Duryodhana and Arjuna arrive at Anarta city (Dwaraka) seeking alliance = *Mbh 5.7 Both Duryodhana and Arjuna arrived at the city of Anarta (Dwaraka alias Dwaravati) seeking alliance of Yadavas, to join their side in the Kurukshetra War. Some Yadava heroes allied with Kauravas while others allied with the Pandavas. Vasudeva Krishna allied with the Pandavas and promised not to take any weapons in the battle. Thus he took part in the war not as a warrior, but as a diplomat, an ambassador of peace, an adviser on war-strategy and as the guide and car-driver of Arjuna. The army owned by Vasudeva Krishna, called the Narayani Sena was given to Duryodhana. The Narayani Sena consisted of a large body of cowherd warriors, all of whom are able to fight in the thick of battle. Another hero Bala Rama, took a neutral standpoint, though he wished to aid Duryodhana, because he cannot fight against his brother Vasudeva Krishna, who had already joined the Pandavas. Thus he will not fight for any of the parties and wished to set for a pilgrimage over Sarasvati River. The Bhoja Yadava hero, Kritavarman joined Duryodhana with a body of troops numbering an Akshauhini of troops. Another Yadava hero, Satyaki joined the Pandavas, with an Akshohini of troops. = Anarta mentioned as a kingdom of Ancient India (Bharata Varsha) = *MBh. 6.9 the Pundras, the Bhargas, the Kiratas, the Sudeshnas, and the Yamunas, the Sakas, the Nishadhas, the Anartas, the Nairitas, the Durgalas, the Pratimasyas, the Kuntalas, and the Kusalas; = Anartas in Kurukhsetra war = * Satyaki was a general in the Pandava, army.

He wrote his most famous song, \\"Beautiful Rivers and Mountains,\\" in protest of the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee in 1972. Shin was later imprisoned and tortured by Park's regime, and his music was banned until the 1980s. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1990s and has since received numerous accolades recognizing his contributions to South Korean popular music.  Early life  Shin Jung-hyeon was born in Seoul in 1938, during the Japanese occupation of Korea. His mother died when he was a child, and his father later married a Japanese woman. Shin spent his youth with his father and step-mother living in Manchuria and Japan. After they returned to what had become South Korea, Shin's father died in 1952, and his stepmother died the following year. After her death, Shin moved to Seoul, where he worked in a pharmaceutical factory and attended night school. During this time, he taught himself to play guitar after a failed attempt at learning to play the violin.  Career  = Beginnings = In 1957, when he was 19 years old, Shin made his debut at a U.S. military base in South Korea, one of the few places where South Korean musicians could find regular work at the time. Shin had been inspired by the American rock, jazz and, later, psychedelic rock he heard on the American Forces Korea Network radio station. Using the stage name Jackie Shin, he gained immense popularity performing on bases, and was performing up to 40 shows per month at one point. Shin later said that the U.S. military bases were where Korean rock was born. = Solo album and first South Korean rock band = Shin released his first album, Hiki Shin Guitar Melody, in 1958. The album included original songs in a variety of styles, covers of traditional Korean music, and covers of the hit American instrumental songs \\"Honky Tonk\\" and \\"Green Onions.\\" Today, the album is highly valued by record collectors, and a copy of the original vinyl record was worth an estimated 10 million KRW in 2016. In 1964, Shin's rock band Add4 released its first album, The Woman in the Rain. Add4 is considered to be South Korea's first rock band. = Mainstream success and psychedelic soul = However, Shin did not achieve mainstream success in South Korea until 1968, when he produced the album My Dear for the singing duo The Pearl Sisters. The album, which included the hit songs \\"My Dear\\" and \\"A Cup of Coffee,\\" was a huge success and went on to sell more than 1 million copies. For the next several years, Shin wrote songs and produced hit records for young musicians including Kim Chu-ja, with whom he made the album Before It's Too Late. Many of these recordings featured Shin's trademark psychedelic soul sound. = \\"Beautiful Rivers and Mountains\\" and arrest = In 1972, the office of South Korean president Park Chung-hee asked Shin to write a song in praise of the president. Shin refused and instead wrote a 10-minute long song about the beauty of South Korea, called \\"Beautiful Rivers and Mountains,\\" which he recorded with his band at the time, Shin Joong Hyun & The Men. After the release of the song, police confiscated Shin's guitars and cut his long hair, which was banned at the time by the South Korean government. However, in 1974, his new band, Shin Joong Hyun & Yup Juns released their self-titled first album, which sold over 1 million copies and included the hit song, \\"Beautiful Woman.\\" In 1975, Shin was arrested for possession of marijuana after giving away a plant to a friend of the president's son., even though marijuana was not yet illegal at the time of his arrest. He was subsequently imprisoned and tortured. He was later imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital. After his release, Shin was banned from performing in South Korea, until after the assassination of Park Chung-hee in 1979. \\"God took Park and opted to save me.\\" However, in the meantime, the public's taste in music had changed, according to Shin. \\"It was all, 'Let's work hard,' and 'Let's be happy' kind of stuff. It was completely physical, with no spirit, no mentality, no humanity,\\" he later said. Because he could not perform, he turned to producing and song-writing, among other occupations. = Later career and retirement = During the 1980s, Shin ran a music club in Itaewon, a Seoul neighborhood popular with foreign visitors and U.S. military personnel. He opened Woodstock, another music club, in southeast Seoul in 1986 and ran it and taught there for the next two decades. In the 1990s, Shin's music experienced a renaissance of popularity in South Korea. Cho Kwon Woo, Shin Hyo Bom and Bom Yarom Kaul Kyou recorded new versions of his songs, as did his son, Shin Daechul. Shin announced his retirement in 2006. His \\"farewell\\" concert aired over the course of 10 nights in December of that year on South Korean television station EBS. However, Shin returned to the stage in 2008 for his first concert in the United States at the Korean Music Festival at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2010, he became the first Asian musician and the sixth in the world to be the recipient of a Fender Custom Shop Tribute Series guitar, joining Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Eddie Van Halen, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Shin had used Fender guitars for much of his career. The following year, in 2011, Seattle-based Light in the Attic Records released the first U.S. pressings of Shin's music. He was honored by Berklee College of Music with an honorary Doctor of Music Award in 2017.  Personal life  Shin has three sons: Shin Daechul, guitarist for the heavy metal band Sinawe; Shin Yunchul, a singer and guitarist; and Shin Seokchul, a session drummer.

Select a title to see its linked publication history and general information. Select a particular edition (title) for more data at that level, such as a front cover image or linked contents. Plot summary The Sea of Trolls is set in Anglo-Saxon England, Scandinavia, and the mythical realm of Jotunheim. Jack Crookleg, the main character of the book, is being trained by a famous skald (bard) named Dragon Tongue, when he and his younger sister, Lucy, are captured by Viking raiders. The pair are to be sold as slaves to \\"Picts\\" as soon as they reach land. On board the Viking ship Jack meets and ultimately befriends Thorgil, a young would-be berserker, and Olaf, the leader of the raiders, along with Boldheart, the crow. The two captives are spared because Jack is a bard and because Lucy is to be given to the queen, a half-troll named Frith. When they arrive at the court nothing goes as planned. Jack is sentenced to menial labor and made to clean the barn. There Jack encounters the deadly troll-pig, Golden Bristles, who is to be sacrificed to the goddess, Freya, by being placed in a wooden cart and left to sink in a bog. After singing Olaf One-Brow's praise-song for the Northman's homecoming, Jack inadvertently makes Queen Frith lose her hair. Queen Frith threatens to sacrifice Lucy (instead of the troll-pig) to the goddess Freya, because Jack set Golden Bristles free. However, Frith allows Jack a chance to save Lucy and their freedom if he can make her hair grow back, which is much more difficult than she makes it sound. Jack goes with Olaf and Thorgil to Jotunheim, land of the Trolls, to seek the mythic Mimir's Well, a well with magical water (song mead) which gives the drinker knowledge, at the roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. Olaf One-Brow is killed by a \\"trollbear,\\" a gigantic bear native to Jotunheim. Jack and Thorgil are captured by a dragon, but Bold Heart tricks the dragon and enables Jack and Thorgil to escape. Thorgil slays the baby male dragon but gets some blood on her tongue, allowing her to speak with birds. On the way Jack also visits the queen of the Jotuns (Trolls), as he needs her consent to continue seeking Mimir's Well. He finds the tree Yggdrasil and Mimir's Well. Both he and Thorgil drink from the well, and Jack saves some for Rune, a skald (bard) who teaches Jack poetry. With the knowledge Jack gains from drinking from Mimir's Well, he returns to the land of the Northmen to restore Frith's hair. Upon return, Jack and Lucy are summoned to the court. Jack explains to Queen Frith that she needs to cut off 1/3 of the hair from her troll cats but no more to restore her hair. She doesn't listen and cuts all of the cats' hair off. As a result, Frith's hair grows everywhere not just back on her head. She runs off crazed. Later Olaf's oldest son commands the ship and takes Jack and Lucy back to their village. Jack finds his mother and learns that Dragon Tongue has been crazed ever since Jack and Lucy's kidnapping. He goes to see Dragon Tongue with Bold Heart and Dragon Tongue's heart stops beating. Jack gives Dragon Tongue the remaining mead from Mimir's Well and he comes back to life. Dragon Tongue tells him that he became a crow during the voyage.

He was a member of the generation of the Franco-Flemish School of composers who were contemporaries of Palestrina. Unlike famous composers of his time he mostly worked in northern Europe. His style is a transition between that of Nicolas Gombert and the mature Orlande de Lassus. His compositions were modern in the use of chromaticism and dissonance.  Life  Details of Waelrant's roots are uncertain, but he may have been one of a family of lawyers from Antwerp, the city in which he spent most of his life. Since some of his children were also lawyers it is seen as likely that he was related to this family. As a young man he may have studied in Italy, a common destination for a talented singer and composer from the Netherlands in the 16th century. While there is no documentary evidence for a trip to Italy, Waelrant maintained contact with a wealthy patron there, and his madrigals the influence of some of the more progressive Italian composers of his time. The artist married at least three times: to Maria Loochenborch (c1547), to Anna Ablyt (or Van Covelen) (28 July 1564) and to Johanna Cleerhaghen on 3 May 1581. He may have been married a fourth time to Maeyken Corecopers on 23 July 1551 (1995, p. 53). He had 10 children with his first wife. Three of his sons, called Raymond, Peter and Paul became organists. The first definite evidence of his activities is in the archives of the Antwerp cathedral and the St. James' Church in Antwerp, where he was a tenor singer in 1544 and 1545. In the mid 1550s he was active as a teacher of music as well. Waelrant founded a music school in Antwerp. He entered into lease agreements from 1553 to 1556 for operating the music school.Howard Slenk, The Music School of Hubert Waelrant, in: Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer, 1968), Published by: University of California Press on behalf of the American Musicological Society, pp. 157-167 Title page of the 'Sacrarum cantionum' published by Waelrant and de Laet in 1554/1555 According to his pupil Frans Sweerts (Franciscus Sweertius), writing in Athenae belgicae (1628), he was an innovator of solmization for which he devised two new methods. The composer first added si to the six syllables of the hexacord and then repeated ut to make a full octave. He then created a new method with these new syllables. The second invention involved the creation of an octave using eight syllables with new names all different from the existing names of notes. The new names are: BA, NI, MA, LO, GA, DI, SE and BO. The innovations were intended to address the problems inherent to the existing Guidonian system which used three overlapping hexacords and the difficulties of mutation.Jessie Ann Owens, 'Waelrant and Bocedization: Reflections on Solmization Reform', in: Music Fragments and Manuscripts in the Low Countries; Alta Capella; Music Printing in Antwerp and Europe in the 16th Century, edited by Eugeen Schreurs and Henri Vanhulst, Yearbook of the Alamire Foundation 2 (Leuven, 1997) 377-393, 1997 He began his activities as a publisher in the early 1550s in partnership with Jan de Laet. Waelrant acted as the publisher and bookseller and handled the financial and sales aspects of the operation while de Laet took care of everything to do with the printing. Waelrant may also have become involved occasionally with the printing side of the enterprise as he called himself a 'typographus' in two books. The printing and publishing partnership eventually produced 16 publications. His adherence to the Roman Catholic faith has been a matter of dispute. Evidence in his music suggests that he may have had Protestant sympathies, and indeed may have been an Anabaptist, although legal documents show him to have been a Catholic. It was a turbulent time of religious conflict‚Äîone of the reasons many local composers went to Italy and other countries‚Äîand Waelrant may have been deliberately unclear as to his beliefs; Antwerp changed hands several times during his life, alternately captured by Calvinists and the Catholic Habsburgs, and both sides suffered persecution. Some of Waelrant's simple psalm settings in the vernacular language suggest that he was a Protestant, and there is evidence that they were confiscated by Catholic church authorities at Kortrijk. Details of his life are sparse after 1558, but he probably remained in Antwerp, where he was active as a composer, consultant for the tuning of cathedral bells, and music editor. He collaborated on a music anthology with several other Flemish composers in 1584, including Cornelis Verdonck and Andreas Pevernage, and the next year he edited a book of Italian madrigals (Symphonia angelica), some of which he wrote himself, which became extraordinarily successful (Italian madrigals were one of the most popular forms of music in Europe in the late 16th century, and composers wrote them, in Italian, even in countries where Italian was not spoken.) At the end of his life he endured financial difficulty. He died in 1595 and was buried in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal (Church of Our Lady, Antwerp).  Music  The song 'Vorria morire' by Hubert Waelrant, published by Girolamo Scotto in Venice in 1565 Waelrant wrote sacred and secular vocal music as well as instrumental music. His output included motets, metrical psalm settings, French chansons, Italian madrigals, Italian napolitane (secular songs, of a light character, such as would be sung in Naples), and arrangements of the Italian pieces for instruments such as lute. His motets are the most progressive part of his output, and are characteristic of the mid-century practice intermediate between the smooth, pervading imitation of composers such as Nicolas Gombert, where all voices where equal, and textural contrast was minimized; and late-century composers such as Lassus. Indeed, many of his motets are reminiscent of Lassus, using chromaticism, cross-relations, textural contrast, and always remaining carefully attentive to the comprehensibility of the text. Waelrant uses text-painting as well, highlighting individual words with characteristic gestures, as a method to increase the expressivity of the music. Occasionally, his use of text-painting is obvious: for example, in his chanson Musiciens qui chantez, after the word \\"taire\\" (silent) all the voices rest for a moment of silence. Harmonically, Waelrant usually preferred voicings that contained complete triads, and with his preference for root motions of fifths over those of thirds, one can hear the impending tonal structures of the Baroque era, which was to begin shortly after his death. In this regard his motets also resembled those of Lassus. Waelrant's activities as an editor and performer influenced his approach to composition, and his manuscripts are full of helpful shorthand to the performers. He was careful to align notes and syllables, a practice by no means universal in the 16th century, and he used accidentals reliably, rarely leaving the interpretation of half- and whole-steps to the singer. His settings of secular texts ranged from the light to the serious, and employ an array of contrapuntal devices, a characteristic more of secular music in northern Europe than in Italy. But the language of the settings is Italian for the madrigals and French for the chansons. Most of his music was published in Antwerp, although at least one collection of 30 songs (napolitane) was published in Venice (1565). Waelrant was involved in efforts to compose music for contemporary Dutch-language lyrics. Together with Gregorius Trehou, Cornelis Verdonck and Andreas Pevernage he would have set lyrics of Jan van der Noot's Lofsang van Braband (Hymn to Brabant, Antwerp, Gilles van den Rade, 1580) to music.Jan Willem Bonda, De meerstemmige Nederlandse liederen van de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw.

It functions as part of the electron transport chain and is the main subunit of transmembrane cytochrome bc1 and b6f complexes.  Function  In the mitochondrion of eukaryotes and in aerobic prokaryotes, cytochrome b is a component of respiratory chain complex III () ‚Äî also known as the bc1 complex or ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. In plant chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, there is an analogous protein, cytochrome b6, a component of the plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (), also known as the b6f complex. These complexes are involved in electron transport, the pumping of protons to create a proton-motive force (PMF). This proton gradient is used for the generation of ATP. These complexes play a vital role in cells.  Structure  Cytochrome b/b6 is an integral membrane protein of approximately 400 amino acid residues that probably has 8 transmembrane segments. In plants and cyanobacteria, cytochrome b6 consists of two subunits encoded by the petB and petD genes. Cytochrome b/b6 non-covalently binds two heme groups, known as b562 and b566. Four conserved histidine residues are postulated to be the ligands of the iron atoms of these two heme groups.  Use in phylogenetics  Cytochrome b is commonly used as a region of mitochondrial DNA for determining phylogenetic relationships between organisms, due to its sequence variability. It is considered to be most useful in determining relationships within families and genera. Comparative studies involving cytochrome b have resulted in new classification schemes and have been used to assign newly described species to a genus as well as to deepen the understanding of evolutionary relationships.  Clinical significance  Mutations in cytochrome b primarily result in exercise intolerance in human patients; though more rare, severe multi-system pathologies have also been reported. Single-point mutations in cytochrome b of Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei are associated with resistance to the anti-malarial drug atovaquone.

The initial mass rally that took place on 9 March 1991 was organized by Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá's Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), an opposition political party in Serbia, protesting the rule of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his Socialist Party of Serbia, particularly their misuse of Radio Television Belgrade. Two people died in the ensuing violence, and the government then ordered the Yugoslav People's Army onto the city streets. The police detained several prominent SPO officials and banned two media outlets considered unfriendly to the government. The protests are referred to in Serbian as ', i.e. the March 9 protest, after this initial event. The next day, in reaction to the events of the previous day, more protests drew large and diverse crowds, including leaders of the Democratic Party (DS), with some referring to it as a \\"Velvet Revolution\\". The next day still, the government supporters responded by organizing a counter-rally of their own. The protests ended on March 14 as the leaders of SPO were released from police custody. The government replaced the director of the state TV as well as the Minister of the Interior. Background Beset by a multitude of political and economic issues, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia still existed in March 1991, with Socialist Republic of Serbia as its biggest and most populous constituent part. Multi-party political system had been introduced less than a year earlier, in 1990, meaning that instead of the Communist League's (SKJ) Serbian branch (SKS) that exclusively ruled for 45 years, Serbia's political landscape was once again, for the first time since the early 1940s, dotted with many parties. However, only three parties could boast any kind of actual significance: Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Dra≈°koviƒá's Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), and Democratic Party (DS) led at the time by Dragoljub Miƒáunoviƒá and featuring high-ranking members Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá and Vojislav Ko≈°tunica who would both later rise to greater prominence. In addition to political turbulence in each of the country's six constituent republics, the security situation in SFR Yugoslavia was deteriorating as well. Incidents were especially frequent in the Socialist Republic of Croatia where the two constituent ethnic groups ‚Äî Croats and Serbs ‚Äî began clashing following the May 1990 election victory of the right-wing nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) that pursued secessionism from the Yugoslav federation, a policy which the Serbs protested and actively obstructed by engaging in a series of actions collectively termed the Log Revolution. By spring 1991, the situation in SR Croatia got extremely tense, and just days before the March 9 protest in Belgrade, the incident in Pakrac occurred. Meanwhile, in SR Serbia, Milo≈°eviƒá firmly controlled all the pillars of power: he himself was the President of the Republic; his party SPS, thanks to its huge parliamentary majority (194 seats out of 250), easily formed a stable government headed by prime minister Dragutin Zelenoviƒá (former communist apparatchik, at that moment extremely loyal to Milo≈°eviƒá). Additionally, through party-installed people like the Radio Television Belgrade general-director Du≈°an Miteviƒá, Milo≈°eviƒá had a tight grip on the most important and influential media outlets, often using them for his own ends, although still not as blatantly and brazenly as he would later throughout the 1990s once the wars and UN sanctions set in. On the other hand, opposition led most prominently by SPO (19 parliamentary seats out of 250) and to a lesser extent DS (7 seats) was often plagued by internal squabbles, ego clashes, and low-level skullduggery. Though Dra≈°koviƒá and SPO had already been engaged in the, often dirty and personal, political battle with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, his wife Mira Markoviƒá, and their allies within the Serbian administration, this antagonism particularly intensified following the joint parliamentary and presidential elections of December 9, 1990 where Milo≈°eviƒá and Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) scored an overwhelming victory, but Dra≈°koviƒá also had a notable showing with over 800,000 votes in the presidential race that made him the most significant opposition figure. Since their access to state-controlled media, either print or electronic, was fairly limited, Dra≈°koviƒá and his party frequently criticized and ridiculed Serbian leadership through the SPO-published weekly magazine Srpska reƒç, edited by his wife Danica. One of the issues in February 1991 depicted Mira Markoviƒá with a Stalin-like moustache and a headline \\"≈†ta hoƒáe generali\\" (What Do Generals Want). The administration's answer was an anti-SPO commentary read by TV Belgrade's journalist Slavko Budihna during central daily newscast Dnevnik 2 on February 16, 1991. Among other things Budihna read: The following day, February 17, the commentary got published in its entirety in that day's issue of Politika ekspres daily. Dra≈°koviƒá's response to this blatant misuse of the media was to demand an immediate retraction, but several days later on February 19 TV Belgrade management, specifically its news division chief Predrag Vitas, turned him down explaining that \\"retractions are issued only in the cases of dissemination of inaccurate information, but not for commentaries\\". Determined not to let this go, the following day, February 20, Dra≈°koviƒá issued a call to the streets for March 9 where the protesters would publicly demand the retraction of the original defamatory piece. From then on Dra≈°koviƒá often referred to TV Belgrade in derisive terms as \\"TV Bastille\\": Still, while the immediate cause for the demonstration was ostensibly specific and narrow, this protest also had a wider ideological aspect. From its very name Protest against red star over to numerous examples of royalist insignia among the crowds, Dra≈°koviƒá was very much whipping up old Chetnik ‚Äì Partisan issues that were at the time beginning to be talked about again publicly after almost 50 years. When SPO called the protest for March 9, DS was on the fence. Their relationship with SPO at the time was somewhat on the cool side because two of DS prominent figures, Kosta ƒåavo≈°ki (one of the 13 founders) and Nikola Milo≈°eviƒá (high-ranking member), recently left the party to form their own and were now openly co-operating with SPO. On top of that, ideologically speaking, the two parties had very little in common other than their general anti- Milo≈°eviƒá stance. And this protest initially was not clearly anti-Milo≈°eviƒá as much as it was brought on by the feud SPO had with state TV. In the end, no DS members were on the list of speakers but many still decided to show up at the protest in their individual capacity. The motives for the protest varied. It has been variously described as an anti-war protest, or as a protest against the confrontational policies of the SPS, particularly against their complete exclusion of the opposition from state politics. Protest =Lead-up to the March 9 rally= In the days following Dra≈°koviƒá's call to the streets, SPO reiterated its demand for the retraction of the controversial newscast commentary, but also formulated an official list of demands. They wanted the Serbian National Assembly, as an institution that founded TV Belgrade, to \\"prohibit SPS and SK-PzJ from creating and conducting the television network's editorial and staff hiring policies\\". They also wanted TV Belgrade's two channels to be \\"non-partisan and accessible to all political parties in proportion to their size and voter strength\\". Furthermore, they demanded resignations from the key TV Belgrade personnel ‚Äî director Du≈°an Miteviƒá, as well as four other editors and on-air personalities: Slavko Budihna, Predrag Vitas (head of the news division), Ivan Krivec, and Sergej ≈†estakov. And finally, they demanded \\"cessation of the practice of obstructing the work of Studio B and Yutel\\".9. mart ‚Äì dve decenije ;Istinomer.rs, Sini≈°a Dedeiƒá, March 9, 2011 Other opposition parties, including the Democratic Party (DS), People's Peasant Party (NSS), People's Radical Party (NRS), New Democracy (ND), Democratic Forum, and Liberal Party, joined and supported the set of demands. In the days leading up to the protest Milo≈°eviƒá seemed intent not to let it take place. On Thursday, March 7, the city of Belgrade police branch issued a special junction banning the protest while citing \\"the location and the time of day when the rally is scheduled as disruptive to the public order and unobstructed flow of traffic\\". As an alternative, they suggested the wide open space at U≈°ƒáe as the location for the protest, but SPO immediately refused to move the protest location. Seeing that the gathering at the Republic Square would not be allowed by the police thus realizing the potential for street clashes, Dra≈°koviƒá appeared interested in some kind of a last-minute mediation attempt or indirect deal by having his SPO MPs call for an immediate parliamentary meeting. However, they were flatly rejected by the SPS majority. Finally, on March 8, just one day before the scheduled protest, SPO MPs demanded a personal meeting with Milo≈°eviƒá in his cabinet, but this time Milo≈°eviƒá didn't even dignify their request with a response. Milo≈°eviƒá's administration appeared confident, even arrogant, about possessing enough means and support to stop the protest from taking place. =March 9= Renowned Serbian writer Borislav Pekiƒá was one of many well-known Serbs at the protest March 9, 1991 was a pleasant, partly sunny, slightly windy Saturday in late winter. The protest was scheduled to take place at the Republic Square in Belgrade, a wide open area right in the city's downtown core. In the early morning, the square was already filled with a substantial crowd. The police presence was also heavy. Just after 10 a.m. the police (consisting of members from all over Serbia as well as the police reserve members) established control over most streets in the city centre and blocked major roads heading into Belgrade. This led to numerous incidents throughout different parts of the city centre before the protest rally even started as the police tried, often brutally, to impede the stream of people heading to the square. Soon after, the battles started at the square itself as the police started using armoured vehicles, water cannons, and tear gas in an attempt to drive the protesters out of the square. Enraged protesters immediately began responding, some of them armed with sticks, traffic sign poles, crowbars or whatever else they could get their hands on. The crowd from the adjoining streets jeered the police, chanting angrily at them to \\"go to Pakrac\\" or to \\"go to Kosovo\\". Some of the others from the crowd that managed to get into the square made allusions to the Romanian Revolution of 1989 chanting \\"alea alea Securitatea\\" while calling Milo≈°eviƒá a fascist. While battles and skirmishes were already taking place for more than an hour, mass bedlam started around 11:30 a.m. when a large crowd of protesters held in check up to that point near the Ruski car restaurant managed to break through the police cordon. Yelling \\"Usta≈°e, Usta≈°e\\" at the police, the protesters started moving further into the square near the monument while the police tried unsuccessfully to stop them with a water cannon.Beograd ‚Äì rati≈°te ;Istinomer.rs, Sini≈°a Dedeiƒá, March 10, 2011 Simultaneously, the scheduled speakers, including Dra≈°koviƒá, had trouble making it into the square. Along with his entourage consisting of some 200 SPO members, a little after 11:30 a.m. Dra≈°koviƒá was being held at the intersection of November 29 Street and Va≈°ingtonova Street, surrounded by the police cordon that didn't want to let them join the protesters at the Republic Square. He tried to reason with them, appealing with their chiefs to let him into the square \\"in order to calm the crowd and prevent bloodshed\\". Some 15 minutes later, the police let them through without much resistance. Getting into the square, the impressive crowd size probably surprised even Dra≈°koviƒá himself as the entire area was literally flooded with people. Flanked by the individuals loyal to him (including several prominent members of the Belgrade underworld such as ƒêorƒëe \\"Gi≈°ka\\" Bo≈æoviƒá and Aleksandar \\"Knele\\" Kne≈æeviƒá who essentially acted as his bodyguards), Dra≈°koviƒá climbed the Prince Mihailo Monument and attempted to address the large crowd using a megaphone. Estimates on the number of people in the crowd vary: under 70,000, around 100,000, or in excess of 150,000. Realizing very few could hear him, Dra≈°koviƒá then decided to seek permission from nearby National Theater personnel to address the crowds from its balcony, which provided a nice view of the entire square. Permission was granted by then-director Vida Ognjenoviƒá (incidentally a prominent DS member), so Dra≈°koviƒá took to the balcony and began a fiery speech often interrupted by thunderous applause: > Serbia, may God give us the dawn of freedom in our homeland as well. I'm not > going to tell you everything that has happened since this morning; we all > broke through different police barriers and therein showed that no obstacle > will stop us. I salute you, heroes! I said it a month ago ‚Äì even when the > Bolsheviks didn't believe me ‚Äì and I'll say it again right this moment: > today, in front of our righteous Prince [referring to the statue of Prince > Mihailo Obrenoviƒá that dominates the square, and especially in a few moments > when we start marching on TV Bastille, we will show Serbian heart and we > will show Serbian persistence. Unfortunately, we have no other way! Heroes, > I remind you of the words of our pan-Serbian patriarch of our pan-Serbian > mind, vladika Njego≈°: ‚ÄòSvak je roƒëen za po jednom mreti‚Äô. They've got until > 3:30 p.m. to issue a retraction and tender resignations and if they do that > we'll return here to this pan-Serb gathering of national unity. Because of > the brutal police charge on the unarmed people, we also demand that the > Minister of the Interior resign at the very next parliamentary session. The > President of the Republic [Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá] has to weigh between two > choices in front of him: on one end of the scale are your lives as well as > lives of many policemen because I heard our boys seized a lot of automatic > weaponry in fights with police today ‚Äì on that scale there are so many > lives, Serbia's freedom, honour, and peace ‚Äì while on the other end of the > scale there are only 5 resignations and 1 retraction. Let the President > decide what he wants, I have made my choice: I will lead the charge on > Television today, fully ready to die! His last proclamation put the present police squadron (led by Milo≈°eviƒá loyalist Radovan \\"Bad≈æa\\" Stojiƒçiƒá) in full alert mode. After Dra≈°koviƒá finished, other people took the microphone, among them Milan Paro≈°ki, ≈Ωarko Jokanoviƒá, Leon Koen, Milan Komneniƒá and Borislav Mihajloviƒá Mihiz. Dragoslav Bokan and Borislav Pekiƒá were also present. Around noon, in the middle of Mihiz's speech, police moved into the square with tear gas and a full-blown battle began. However, overwhelmed and outnumbered by the crowd the police retreated while trying to keep the angry protesters in check with water cannons. The situation was deteriorating by the second, flower beds were being overturned and broken off into smaller pieces of concrete to be thrown onto police vehicles. Dra≈°koviƒá did not seem fazed by scenes of violence below, and if anything was only spurring them on. At one point he even bizarrely yelled \\"Juuuuuuri≈°\\" (Chaaaaaarge) into the microphone the way a field general would at the scene of battle. The protest then spilled into adjoining streets and squares and most of the downtown Belgrade soon resembled a war zone. By this time, the police managed to regroup and reinforce their numbers and began responding and attacking a lot more forcefully. Still, for about seven hours the protesters almost controlled the city as the majority of the police was guarding the TV Belgrade building and Dedinje. According to sources, some 200 policemen and 180 security guards in addition to 200 television staffers with basic military training who were given AK-47s were guarding the television building. In the afternoon, Dra≈°koviƒá, along with a large group of protesters, unsuccessfully attempted to storm the National Assembly of Serbia session. As he exited the building, he was arrested along with SPO deputy president Jovan Marjanoviƒá. Among the policemen handling Dra≈°koviƒá's arrest was Naser Oriƒá. Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá demanded that the Presidency of Yugoslavia deploys troops of the Yugoslav People's Army to suppress the protest. Borisav Joviƒá contacted other members of the Presidency by phone and the Army was indeed deployed, but the Slovenians later claimed the move was made unconstitutionally. In the evening, Milo≈°eviƒá took to the public airwaves to address the nation. While not mentioning anyone by name he characterized the day's events as being orchestrated by \\"forces of chaos and madness threatening to restore everything that the people of Serbia rose against half a century ago\\". Tanks and armored cars rolled onto the streets. Radio B92 and Studio B television were banned and stopped broadcasting. Additionally, 203 protesters were injured and further 108 were arrested on March 9. 636 people were arrested following the protest. =Casualties= The protest claimed two lives. On March 9 around 3:30 pm while running away from the crowd of protesters in Masarikova Street near Beograƒëanka, 54-year-old policeman Nedeljko Kosoviƒá died from repeated blows to the head. Later in the day, 17-year-old protester Branivoje Milinoviƒá was killed by a stray bullet. The circumstances of his death are conflicting as some reports claim he died as the crowd was storming the SR Serbia parliament building while others say he was killed by a rubber bullet when a group of policemen on the corner of Admirala Geprata Street and Kneza Milo≈°a street opened fire in the direction of protesters in front of London Cafe. The investigation into his death was recently reopened. =March 10= The next day, March 10, Belgrade awoke to the anti-opposition headline \\"Ru≈°ilaƒçki pohod\\" (Destructive Crusade) on the front page of Politika, the most important of the four dailies being published in the city at the time. Edited by the Milo≈°eviƒá loyalist ≈Ωika Minoviƒá, the rest of that day's issue was not much different ‚Äî of the 51 total pieces about the previous day's events, 49 presented a strong condemnation of the opposition, SPO, and Dra≈°koviƒá. Veƒçernje novosti, edited by Rade Brajoviƒá, ran a fairly balanced March 10 issue, mostly covering the events neutrally and avoiding emotional outbursts in favour of either side. However, according to the paper's journalist Miroslav Turudiƒá, at the staff meeting that very Sunday evening the editor-in-chief Brajoviƒá objected to the paper's coverage of the protests. Along with deciding to steer the coverage in the following day's issue clearly to the Milo≈°eviƒá's side, Brajoviƒá also published a commentary in which he openly criticizes his staff's previous coverage of the protests. DS held a press conference with its president Dragoljub Miƒáunoviƒá as well as members Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá and Vojislav Ko≈°tunica on hand, voicing support to arrested Dra≈°koviƒá and SPO while condemning government actions. ƒêinƒëiƒá described the events of the previous day as \\"the police carrying out a plan, a one man's personal plan, one man who decided that this protest cannot and will not happen\\" going on to say that \\"the catastrophe occurred due to the inability of those giving orders to the police to adapt to the rapidly changing situation on the ground\\". During late evening hours, a large crowd again began to gather, but this time in front of the Terazije fountain. The protest now assumed a more civil tone, although there were still incidents on Branko's Bridge when a group of 5,000 University of Belgrade students heading into the city centre from their residence in Studentski Grad in order to join the protesters got stopped by police. Pepper spray was used and some of the students were beaten, but all of them were eventually allowed to pass through and join the crowd at Terazije (among the individuals negotiating with the police on the bridge was a Democratic Party (DS) member Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá). Gatherings in front of the Terazije fountain were notably led and moderated by actor Branislav Leƒçiƒá with various figures from Serbian public life such as screenwriter Du≈°an Kovaƒçeviƒá, actor Rade ≈†erbed≈æija, and even Serbian Patriarch Pavle taking turns addressing the crowd. In his speeches, Leƒçiƒá often referred to the rally as \\"Velvet Revolution\\" while holding a stuffed panda toy and drawing parallels with the Czechoslovak protests of November 1989. The protest also expanded in terms of the political figures that joined it with DS members now officially taking part. The anti-government component was now much more prominently displayed among the crowds. The protesters, composed largely of students, demanded freedom for Dra≈°koviƒá and Jovan Marjanoviƒá. In addition to earlier protests for the resignation of Du≈°an Miteviƒá, they now wanted the Minister of Interior Radmilo Bogdanoviƒá to resign too. They also sought the lifting of the broadcast ban for Radio B92 and RTV Studio B. =March 11= On March 11, the Serbian government regrouped by organising a mass counter-rally at their old stomping grounds U≈°ƒáe. Called under the name \\"For the defense of the Republic, for constitutionality, freedom, and democracy\\", the rally attempted to show that protesters at the Republic Square and Terazije in no way represented the wishes and desires of the majority of the Serbian population. Using previously developed and tested astroturfing methods, they bussed many workers into Belgrade from other parts of Serbia for the occasion and also used its grip on state TV to inflate the crowd size. Still, a good portion of the crowd was there on its own volition, especially older individuals and many pensioners that were always Milo≈°eviƒá's core support. Instead of Milo≈°eviƒá addressing the gathered crowd, the speaking was left to his party's most publicly prominent members and ideologues at the time: Mihailo Markoviƒá, Du≈°an Matkoviƒá, ≈Ωivorad Igiƒá, Radoman Bo≈æoviƒá, Petar ≈†kundriƒá, etc. The most controversial speech of the day was Matkoviƒá's, at times referring to protesters as \\"hooligans\\" and inciting their own supporters to \\"do away with them\\". =Up to March 14= The protests persisted and after four days of mostly peaceful demonstration (there were further skirmishes with police on March 11), they achieved their aims: Dra≈°koviƒá and Marjanoviƒá were freed and Miteviƒá and Bogdanoviƒá were replaced. The demonstrations ended after March 14.

History =Founding= Kappa Gamma Delta began during the winter quarter of 1993 at the University of California, Davis when students Charlene Tran and Marge Lee envisioned a professional sorority that would provide support for women during the premedical process. They and 10 other women made up the founding class of 12 scholars. Tran and Lee received help from Sigma Mu Delta, a premedical fraternity. During the first meeting on March 3, 1994, in the lounge of Temescal apartments in Davis, twelve women‚ÄîMaricris Belisario, Chong Choe, Mindy Compton, Pamela Hy, Marge Lee, Kathy Pham, Jennifer Skinkle (now Jennifer Schwartz), Charlene Tran, Gwen Tran, Aileen Tieu, Carolyn Trieu, and Julie Tse‚Äîcommitted themselves to the responsibility and dedication in the construction of this new sorority. With its founding, Kappa Gamma Delta became the first premedical sorority in the United States of America. The first Coat-of-Arms consisted of an open book, a haystack, the sorority flower, the female symbol, and an Oil lamp. The haystack was later replaced by a torch surrounded by several rings. The founders chose the sorority symbol to be the caduceus, wings, and the female symbol. The sorority song and oath were adopted on June 10, 1994. The constitution was affirmed May 30, 1994.

Their existence was first discovered in the late 20th century by fishermen and recreational divers. Blue holes typically contain tidally influenced water of fresh, marine, or mixed chemistry. They extend below sea level for most of their depth and may provide access to submerged cave passages.Mylroie, J. E., Carew, J. L., and Moore, A. I., (1995), Blue Holes: Definition and Genesis: Carbonates and Evaporites, v. 10, no. 2, p. 225. Well- known examples can be found in South China Sea (Dragon Hole), Belize (Great Blue Hole), the Bahamas (Dean's Blue Hole), Guam, Australia (in the Great Barrier Reef), and Egypt (in the Red Sea). Blue holes are distinguished from cenotes in that the latter are inland voids usually containing fresh groundwater rather than seawater. Description Blue holes are roughly circular, steep-walled depressions, and so named for the dramatic contrast between the dark blue, deep waters of their depths and the lighter blue of the shallows around them. Their water circulation is poor, and they are commonly anoxic below a certain depth; this environment is unfavorable for most sea life, but nonetheless can support large numbers of bacteria. The deep blue color is caused by the high transparency of water and bright white carbonate sand. Blue light is the most enduring part of the spectrum; other parts of the spectrum--red, yellow, and finally green--are absorbed during their path through water, but blue light manages to reach the white sand and return upon reflection. The deepest blue hole in the world at 300.89 meters (987 feet) deep is in the South China Sea and is named the Dragon Hole, or Longdong. The second deepest blue hole in the world with underwater entrance at is Dean's Blue Hole, located in a bay west of Clarence Town on Long Island, Bahamas. Other blue holes are about half that depth at around . The diameter of the top entrance ranges typically from (Dean's Blue Hole) to (Great Blue Hole in Belize). The overall largest blue hole (taking into account depth and width) is located 100 kilometers from the coast of Belize. The Great Blue Hole is a massive 300 meters wide and 125 meters deep. Formation Blue holes formed during past ice ages, when the sea level was as low as lower than at present. At those times, these formations were targets of the same erosion from rain and chemical weathering common in all limestone-rich terrains; this ended once they were submerged at the end of the ice age. Most blue holes contain freshwater and saltwater. The halocline is the point in these blue holes where the freshwater meets the saltwater and where a corrosive reaction takes place that eats away at the rock. Over time this can create side passages, or horizontal \\"arms\\", that extend from the vertical cave. These side passages can be quite long; e.g., over in the case of the Sawmill Sink in the Bahamas. Occurrence Blue holes are typically found on shallow carbonate platforms, exemplified by the Bahama Banks, as well as on and around the Yucat√°n Peninsula, such as at the Great Blue Hole at Lighthouse Reef Atoll, Belize. Many deep spring basins formed by karst processes and located inland also are called blue holes, for example, Blue Hole in Castalia, Ohio.  Life forms  Many different fossils have been discovered that indicate the type of life forms that existed in blue holes. Other life forms such as marine life and marine fossils have also been noticed; crocodile and tortoise fossils, for instance, have been found in blue holes. Important types of bacterial colonies have also been found in blue holes. Due to the conditions of a blue hole, they are forced to live off of sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide, which are toxic to most organisms. These special bacteria have produced many insights into the chemistry and biology of microbial life.  Expeditions  Exploring blue holes requires an extremely high level of expertise in the diving field, hence the fact that very few divers have ever attempted it. In 2009, however, a team of scientists set out to study seven of these blue holes in the Bahamas. Through over 150 dives, the scientists, led by Keith Tinker, investigated bacteria able to live in anoxic environments. This allowed them to make connections to fields such as astrobiology where organisms thrive without oxygen or sunlight. In 2018, another group of scientists set out to explore the Great Blue Hole of Belize using two submarines of the latest technology. One of the major scientific contributions to result from this expedition was the first 3-dimensional map of its interior. The researchers captured features such as stalactites, the hydrogen sulfide layer, and other details that cannot usually be seen by the naked human eye. As part of a three-year study, a group of scientists set out in May and September 2019 to explore a blue hole nicknamed the \\"Amberjack Hole\\" located 30 miles off the coast of Sarasota, Florida. Individuals from Mote Marine Laboratory, Florida Atlantic University, Harbor Branch, Georgia Institute of Technology, the United States Geological Survey, and the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration participated in the expedition. The expedition gathered information about life around and within the hole, seawater composition, and the hole's bottom sediments. A follow-up expedition is planned in August 2020 to a deeper blue hole named the \\"Green Banana\\" off the coast of Florida. In contrast to the various successful expeditions completed, many explorers have perished in their attempts to reach the bottom of a blue hole. The Red Sea Blue Hole located in Egypt is nicknamed the \\"Divers' Cemetery\\" because at least 40 divers have died there.

It is 7 miles (11 km) from Guildford but is closer to the Hampshire towns of Aldershot and Farnborough, the centres of which are each about two miles (4 km) away, immediately across the two crossings of the River Blackwater, to the southwest and northwest. Geography To the east, associated Ricochet Hill in The Ash Military Ranges consists of sand and peat soils mostly covered with heather, fern and gorse, occasionally opened by public announcements from the Ministry of Defence. The rolling plateau of 80-118m above sea level has spots with views west and east ‚Äì here Guildford is visible, six miles away. Ash Vale's extent is on two sides clearly demarcated, by the river to the west and at a few locks' higher elevation by the parallel Basingstoke Canal to the east ‚Äì across these boundaries are, respectively, Aldershot Garrison (Military Town) and the large Surrey Heath MoD, mostly UK Army, ranges and training areas. The latter is a co-managed County Wildlife Site, for instance Ash Ranges at and Pirbright Ranges at , with various access days and parts (see the Wildlife's Trust website). The type of soil of the east, the heath is very acidic, sandy and loamy which makes up just 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil, which gives rise to pines and coniferous landscapes, such as pioneered at Wentworth and Foxhills estate and is good for biodiversity.Cranfield University National Soil Resources Institute Two branch railway lines cross in the middle of the village without forming a junction. In the north of the village are Ash Vale railway station and North Camp railway station, on the London-Aldershot-Alton Line and the Reading-Guildford-Gatwick Line respectively. In addition, trains run through Ash Vale from Guildford to Ascot via Aldershot. The village owes its development to the Garrison and to the railways; see the description of the often heath soil under the Ash article, explaining how to the south lies a limited area of fertile farming country.

Matsya Kingdom was one of the solasa (sixteen) Mahajanapadas (great kingdoms) during vedic era as described in the hindu epic Mahabharta and 6th BCE Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya. In the modern era, the United States of Matsya was a brief union of 4 princely states of Bharatpur, Dholpur, Alwar and Karauli temporarily put together from 1947 to 1949. Etymology Matsya is Sanskrit for \\"fish\\". Matsya is sacred to Hindus as it is one of the avatar (incarnation) of Hindu deity Vishnu which has been described in detail in Matsya Purana. Matsya kingdoms usually have the fish in their state emblem. Vedic era Matsya Kingdoms Matsya Kingdom was one of the solasa (sixteen) Mahajanapadas (great kingdoms). Painted Grey Ware culture (PGW) chiefdoms in the region were succeeded by Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) from c. 700-500 BCE, associated with the rise of the great mahajanapada states (mahajanapada states Kuru, Panchala, Matsya, Surasena and Vatsa) By the late Vedic period, they ruled a kingdom located south of the Kurus, and west of the Yamuna river which separated it from the kingdom of the Panchalas. It roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan, and included the whole of Hindaun, Alwar with portions of Bharatpur as well as South Haryana. The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagari (present-day Bairat) which is said to have been named after its founder king, Virata. In Pali literature, the Matsya tribe is usually associated with the Surasena. The western Matsya was the hill tract on the north bank of the Chambal River. Matsya kingdom was founded by king Matsya who was the twin brother of Satyavati and who was contemporary to Bhishma. In the early 6th century BCE, Matsya was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas mentioned in the Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya, but its power had greatly dwindled and it was of little political importance by the time of Buddha. The Mahabharata (V.74.16) refers to a King Sahaja, who ruled over both the Chedis and the Matsyas, which implies that Matsya once formed a part of the Chedi Kingdom. Other than the Matsya kingdom to the south of Kuru Kingdom, which falls in the Hindaun and Alwar, Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan, the epic refers to as many as six other Matsya kingdoms. Upaplavya was a notable city of the kingdom. On the 13th year of Pandavas's exile, pandavas and Draupadi stay in matsya kingdom of King Virata. Modern era United State of Matsya After the Indian independence in 1947, the princely states of Bharatpur, Dholpur, Alwar and Karauli were temporarily put together from 1947 to 1949 as the \\"United State of Matsya\\", and later in March 1949 after these princely states signed the Instrument of Accession they were merged with the present state of Rajasthan.NWR tourist places Matsya Festival is held in Alwar every year in the last week of November to celebrate culture and adventure.All about Alwar Matsya Festival 2018, Times of India, November 2018.

The Moving Picture World, volume 28, p. 995. He arrived in Hollywood in 1916 and began working as a writer for Western films. His first credit was as scenario writer for the 1916 film A Youth of Fortune. Beebe directed for the first time when Leo D. Maloney, who had been directing a film called The Test, fell ill. Beebe became known as a director of low-budget films and serials. He was once described as being \\"an expert at making something out of nothing.\\" The first serial directed by Beebe was 1932's The Shadow of the Eagle. He went on to direct several other serials, notably Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, Buck Rogers, The Green Hornet, and Don Winslow of the Navy; these were noted by film historian Hal Erickson to be the best of Beebe's works. Beebe preferred to direct westerns; speaking to the Evening Independent, he said that westerns were the \\"bread and butter\\" of film studios. He was listed as a director on over 100 films. Alfred Hitchcock commended Beebe for his 1942 film Night Monster, impressed with the speed and economy of the production. Beebe was married to writer Frances Wiley. The couple had eight children. Their only son, Ford Beebe, Jr., became a director like his father. They lost twin daughters in infancy and had five daughters who survived it: Frances, Mary, Ruthann, Maxine, and Martha.

History =Dinsmore Island= In the 1870s, John Brough, who acquired this island adjacent to Sea Island, built a small house and farmed what became Brough Island. Hugh Boyd purchased the 210-acre property, but resold to John Errington, who dyked and drained the land in the 1880s. The Goodmurphy cannery, which opened in 1894,The Daily Colonist, 13 May 1894 was incorporated the following year as the Dinsmore Island Canning Co. by John Dinsmore, M.B. Wilkinson, W.D. Goodmurphy, and Caleb Goodmurphy.The Daily Colonist, 17 May 1895 The cannery presence renamed the location to Dinsmore Island. In the early 1900s, BC Packers acquired the cannery along with many others along the arms of the Fraser. The plant was demolished in 1913. In 1920, Bob Doherty purchased Dinsmore Island and Pheasant Island in a tax sale. Clearing the neglected land, he maintained a dairy herd, and tenant farmers grew sugar beet and peas. Doherty also arranged the construction of a bridge from Sea Island, via Pheasant Island at the eastern end of Dinsmore Island. In 1939, the federal government expropriated the farm for airport expansion, and the Doherty family moved to Ladner. Channel filling amalgamated Pheasant Island into Dinsmore Island, which in turn absorbed into Sea Island by 1952. =Dinsmore Bridge= The federal Department of Transport called tenders for the bridge in 1968, and for the Vancouver International Airport (YVR) approach roads on Sea Island in 1969, describing the location as Dinsmore Island and the crossing as the Dinsmore Island Bridge.The Daily Colonist: 30 Oct 1968 & 9 Apr 1969 The bridge costed about $550,000, but the whole project appears to have totalled $845,000. The City of Richmond extended Gilbert Rd. to the southern shore, at a cost of $180,000, which included bridging the Lansdowne Canal. 300px The drab concrete structure, which stands on a series of concrete pillars, opened without ceremony in August 1969. Fears it would be tolled never eventuated. YVR owns and maintains this low-level two-lane bridge, with a pedestrian sidewalk on the west side. Being federal property, signage is in both official languages. Although immediately relieving the Moray Bridge, the 1975 opening of the Arthur Laing Bridge, further increased traffic volumes. The two lanes of traffic from Russ Baker Way merging into one lane to cross the Dinsmore, caused rush hour congestion. Although the widening of Russ Baker Way to accommodate the 1993 opening of the No. 2 Road Bridge initially reduced the left turn to a single lane, further widening has returned the double turn lanes. The bridge provides the most direct access to Richmond Hospital and the WorkSafeBC headquarters, and prior to 1993, served all west Richmond traffic. On October 11, 2006, the bridge closed for several days after a truck on River Road, carrying a crane to the Oval site, damaged eight pre-stressed concrete girders on the underside of the bridge. Re-opening October 13, weight and speed restrictions were temporarily in place. The posted clearance is . In 2011, a Beechcraft King Air 100 crash landed near the Russ Baker Way intersection. The two pilots died from burns. In 2014, a novice driver struck and killed a pedestrian, who was standing at the Russ Baker Way intersection waiting to cross. The driver, no longer in Canada, has a warrant out for his arrest. A memorial motorcycle ride takes place on each anniversary. During 2017‚Äì2018, unidentified parties tossed plastic bags full of human excrement onto the bridge. YVR has a goal to seismically upgrade the bridge, or build a wider replacement to better accommodate vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. =South bank redevelopment= During 2014‚Äì2015, River Road was extended eastward along the former CP right-of way to the south end of the bridge. A new ramp beside the bridge linked this road to its existing foreshore alignment. The city intends to continue the four-lane road along the right-of way for to Capstan Way. From east of the bridge, the emerging 37-acre waterfront Lulu Island Park will replace the existing foreshore commercial infrastructure and paving. By 2017, the city had purchased most of the 28 acres of industrial land. To the immediate west of the bridge, construction has begun on a three-tower residential complex. =Transit= See also * List of crossings of the Fraser River * List of BC bridges  Footnotes  References  Box girder bridges in Canada Bridges completed in 1969 Bridges in Greater Vancouver Bridges over the Fraser River Buildings and structures in Richmond, British Columbia Road bridges in British Columbia 1969 establishments in British Columbia Sea Island (British Columbia) ","title":"Dinsmore Bridge"},{"id":"4327746","text":"Matsya Viratnagar in the Mahajanpad period Virata was a kingdom ruled by the Matsya king by the name Virata.

He was convicted of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda but he was acquitted by the tribunal upon appeal.  Background  =Military service= Ndindiliyimana was born in Nyaruhengeri commune in Butare prefecture. He joined the military in 1966 and enrolled in the military academy and following his graduation in 1968 he attended the Royal Higher Institute of Defence in Brussels from 1971 and 1974. When Ndindiliyimana returned, he was assigned to work at the basic training centre in Kanombe and while stationed there he helped establish the Para Commando Battalion in 1975 and served as the unit‚Äôs director of intelligence and training. In 1977, he was transferred to the Rwandan Superior Military School (√âcole Sup√©rieure Militaire), where he taught courses as well as commanding a group of trainees. Subsequently, in 1979 he was transferred to the Staff Headquarters of the Rwandan Army and became the Chief of Personnel of the General Staff and was responsible for recruiting senior, junior and non-commissioned officers as well as enlisted soldiers until 1982. Ndindiliyimana rose through the ranks of the Rwandan Army first as a Commander, then Lieutenant Colonel and then Colonel. =Civilian service= Along with his military duties, Ndindiliyimana served in numerous ministerial positions in the Rwandan government beginning in February 1982 when he was appointed as the Minister of Youth and Sports. Following that he was appointed Minister of Transport and Communication in 1990 and Minister in the President‚Äôs Office for Defence and Security Issues in 1991 and ended serving as Minister of Defence from December 1991 to April 1992. He was also elected the chairman of the Rwandan Olympic Committee in 1992 and served until March 1994. Along with that role in 1993 he was selected as the secretary of Zone 4 of the International Olympic Committee responsible for the Central and West African zones. =Gendarmerie service= In June 1992 he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Gendarmerie nationale. Following his appointment he began rebuilding the organisation‚Äôs command structure, reviewing the Gendarmerie‚Äôs capacity and in June 1993 he wrote a report on the integration of the RPF into the Gendarmerie. On January 1, 1994, he was promoted to the rank of Major General under the provisions of the Arusha Accords. On April 7. 1994 following the assassination of the Rwandan President, Ndindiliyimana became a member of the Crisis Committee, which was composed of a number of senior leaders of the Rwandan Armed Forces but ended on the 9th of April following the restoration of civilian rule. =Post- Gendarmerie= During the middle of the genocide on June 5, 1994, Ndindiliyimana was replaced as Chief of Staff of the Gendarmerie and was appointed ambassador to Germany. On June 17, 1994, he departed Rwanda for Zaire en route to Belgium where he would arrive between the 1st and 2nd of July, 1994. Several senior Belgian military officers helped Ndindiliyimana travel and eventually arrive in Belgium and obtain temporary refugee status. In 1996 the Belgian Commission on Refugees denied his official request for asylum due to \\"serious reasons to think that the subject committed crimes against humanity\\" but the ruling was overturned two years later by a review panel. Ndindiliyimana lived in Belgium until his indictment and arrest in 2000.  Role during the genocide  Ndindiliyimana was accused and acquitted by the ICTR of conspiring with other high-level FAR officers to plan the logistics of the Rwandan genocide. He was also accused and acquitted of the charge that in early April 1994, he informed interahamwe leaders of a plan by UNAMIR force commander Rom√©o Dallaire to search for a cache of weapons, a cache which never existed. Following the death of President Habyarimana, Ndindiliyimana was one of the senior FAR officers to serve on the Crisis Committee, along with Th√©oneste Bagosora and Tharcisse Renzaho. which committee lasted only two days. The judges of the ICTR found that his role on the Committee was a positive one and that he always tried to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ndindiliyimana is mentioned frequently in Rom√©o Dallaire's chronicle of his time as UNAMIR force commander. Dallaire writes that he \\"had always found his [Ndindiliyimana's] loyalties an enigma\\" and initially assumed he represented a moderate voice in the crisis committee which was correct. Dallaire admitted at the trial that the reason he called Ndindiliyimana an enigma was because he expected Ndindilyimana to mount a coup against the government but the coup never took place as Dallaire had expected. General Dallaire testified on his behalf at his trial and stated that Ndindiliyimana was essentially stripped of his command as of April 7th, 1994 and that he worked with Dallaire throughout the war to try to stop killings and to protect civilians. In his autobiography, Paul Rusesabagina says that Ndindiliyimana was more of a moderate who did not seem to entirely approve of the genocide. He also notes that Ndindiliyimana was responsible for dismantling a potentially disastrous roadblock in front of the H√¥tel des Mille Collines. In fact, the evidence in the Military II trial was that Ndindiliyimana's gendarmes initially protected Tutsis at the Hotel Milles Collines assisted later, at Ndindiliyimana's request, by UNAMIR units. Dr. Alison Desforges testified at his trial in November 2006 that Ndindiliyimana was opposed to genocide, and acted to stop killings and was himself threatened because he had Tutsi officers and men in his close protection escort. The transcripts of these testimonies are available from his counsel, Christopher Black of Toronto, Canada and the ICTR.  Arrest and trial  =Indictment and arrest= On January 28, 2000 the ICTR issued an indictment against Ndindiliyimana along with three other Rwandan military officers, Augustin Bizimungu, Fran√ßois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye, and Innocent Sagahutu, charging Ndindiliyimana with conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide or alternatively complicity in genocide, assassination as a crime against humanity, murder as a crime against humanity, extermination as a crime against humanity, persecution on political, racial or religious grounds as a crime against humanity, \\"other inhumane acts as a crime against humanity\\" and various war crimes.. In their indictment prosecutors alleged that Ndindiliyimana played a central role in drawing up a blueprint to exterminate the Tutsi population as well as political opponents of the Hutu government along with ordering specific massacres and crimes against humanity upon the Tutsi population. Alongside those allegations, they alleged that Ndindiliyimana was complicit in the assassination of Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana by allegedly having been aware that the Belgian and Ghanaian soldiers protecting her were being beaten and then executed by Rwandan soldiers but to having done nothing to stop it. Following the indictment he was arrested in Belgium on January 29, 2000 and handed over to the custody of the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania. He was defended by Canadian lawyer Christopher Black. =Conviction= On January 29, 2000 he was arrested in Belgium and handed over to the custody of the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania. =Acquittal= On February 11, 2014 he was acquitted of all other charges of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes though the judges of the Appeal Chamber later found that it was very doubtful that gendarmes were ever involved at Kansi Parish. The ICTR trial judgment recognised Ndindiliyimana's ‚Äúconsistent support for the Arusha Accords and a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Rwandan government forces and the [Rwandan Patriotic Front] RPF his opposition to the massacres in Rwanda. and the fact that he had saved the lives of many Tutsis. The Tribunal also held that his arrest and indictment appeared to be politically motivated. He was sentenced to time served since his arrest eleven years prior to the judgment. The ICTR ordered his release but Ndindiliyimana was unable to return to his home in Belgium and was forced to stay in a UN safe house in Arusha, Tanzania. In late September, 2014 the Belgian government permitted his return to Belgium to rejoin his family after almost 15 years in detention in Tanzania.

Founded in 1980, the SJJHL was a recognized Junior A league from 1989 until 1991. This stretch as a Junior A league marks the last time any Newfoundland or Labrador league competed in the Junior A National Playdowns. History Founded in 1980, the SJJHL competed as a Junior A league from 1989 until 1991. In that time period, they were eligible for the Centennial Cup Canadian National championship of Junior A hockey. Every other year the SJJHL has operated at the Junior B level and its champion represents the league in the Veitch Memorial Cup playdowns against the winner of the Central/West Junior Hockey League for the right to play at the Don Johnson Cup. In the 1970s, there was another league known as the St. John's Junior Hockey League. Much like the Corner Brook League, Southern Shore League, amongst other leagues, the old SJJHL was a junior-aged town league. Although the St. John's Jr. Capitals were a top team in this town league, they would represent St. John's for the Veitch Memorial Trophy as an all-star team of players from the old SJJHL. On one such occasion, in 1972, the Jr. Capitals entered into the first-year Newfoundland Jr. A playdowns, only to win and compete in the 1972 Centennial Cup National Playdowns.

Education  While in high school in 1966, Lagarias studied astronomy at the Summer Science Program. He completed an S.B. and S.M. in Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972. The title of his thesis was \\"Evaluation of certain character sums\\". He was a Putnam Fellow at MIT in 1970. He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT for his thesis \\"The 4-part of the class group of a quadratic field\\", in 1974. His advisor for both his masters and Ph.D was Harold Stark.  Career  In 1975 he joined AT&T; Bell Laboratories and eventually became Distinguished Member of Technical Staff. Since 1995, he has been a Technology Consultant at AT&T; Research Laboratories. In 2002, he moved to Michigan to work at the University and settle down with his family. While his recent work has been in theoretical computer science, his original training was in analytic algebraic number theory. He has since worked in many areas, both pure and applied, and considers himself a mathematical generalist. Lagarias discovered an elementary problem that is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, namely whether for all n > 0, we have : sigma(n) le H_n + e^{H_n} ln H_n with equality only when n = 1. Here Hn is the nth harmonic number, the sum of the reciprocals of the first n positive integers, and œÉ(n) is the divisor function, the sum of the positive divisors of n. He disproved Keller's conjecture in dimensions at least 10. Lagarias has also done work on the Collatz conjecture and Li's criterion and has written several highly cited papers in symbolic computation with Dave Bayer. Awards and honors He received in 1986 a Lester R. Ford award from the Mathematical Association of America and again in 2007.

History  A predecessor of this bridge was opened for service in 1873 as one of the first 15 bridges across the Mississippi River. The current structure opened to traffic in 1898, having been fully reconstructed on the original piers from the 1873 bridge. When it opened, the 444 foot swing span was the longest swing span in the nation.  Appearance  The bridge's distinctive appearance is derived from the variety of truss types installed as different spans were replaced over time. The most recent span replacement occurred in 1945, when three new spans were installed. In its closed position, the bridge provides a vertical clearance of 15.8 feet above the normal pool for this section of the Mississippi River.

The Katoch dynasty are reputed to have ruled Trigarta since time immemorial.  Mention in Mahabharata  Trigarta was a kingdom mentioned in the epic Mahabharata. Mahabharata mentions two different Trigarta kingdoms, one in the west close to the Sivi Kingdom and the other north to the Kuru Kingdom. Modern Kangra is one of the ancient town in North Trigarta, extending westward to the Punjab area. Multan was the capital of Trigarta with its original name that is Mulasthan. The territory of Trigarta Kingdom is around the three rivers of Satluj, Beas, and Ravi. These Trigarta kings were allies of Duryodhana and enemies of Pandavas and Viratas. Their capital was named Prasthala. They attacked the Virata Kingdom aided by the Kurus to steal cattle from there. The Pandavas living there in anonymity helped the Viratas to resist the combined forces of Trigartas and Kurus. Trigarta kings fought the Kurukshetra War and were killed by Arjuna, after a ruthless and bloody conflict. Arjuna also annihilated an Akshouhini (a large military unit) of Trigarta warriors called the Samsaptakas. These warriors had vowed to either die or kill Arjuna as part of a larger plan by Duryodhana to capture Yudhishthira alive.  History  = First Written Reference = Historically, Trigarta first finds mention in the works of Panini from the 5th century B.C. who calls the inhabitants of Trigarta as \\"Ayudhjeevi Sangha\\" or a martial republic. = Mention in Mahabharata of Trigarta and Susarma = Trigarta next finds mention in the Mahabharata's Sabha Parv, where it is included along with a number of other states of the time. The Mahabharata was first penned down around the 4th century B.C. and continued to be written until the 4th century A.D. The founder of Trigarta is mentioned as Susarma/Susharman in the Mahabharata. He was credited with building the Nagarkot/Kangra fort. = Kangra being called Susarmapura and Kalindarine = Kangra was called Susarmapura by a variety of Sanskrit, Buddhist, Jain, and later Islamic scholars. In fact, the first mention of 'Nagarkot' comes from Islamic scholars documenting the region since they mainly referred to the fort. Prior to that, it was mainly documented as Susarmapur. After that, they are mentioned in the works of the Greek geographer Ptolemy who calls Kangra as Kalindarine. = Alexander and Porus of Trigarta = As mentioned by the Greeks, the ruler of Trigarta at the time of invasion by Alexander is called Porous a Katoch King by the Greeks. This is also verified from the fact that Alexander had altars created near modern-day Indaura which lies in Kangra.Direct lineage can be traced to current day communities who served in the indian army, subsequently retiring and settling in Vasant Kunj. = Samudragupta's invasion = Eminent historian Romila Thapar mentions that along with the Greeks, the following were mentioned as vratya kshatriyas or mlechhas: Dravida, Abhira, Sabara, Kirata, Malava, Sibi, Trigarta, and Yaudheya. She provides multiple historical mentions during the period between when Panini(5th Century B.C.) penned the existence of Trigarta and the 5th Century A.D. when Samudragupta invaded Trigarta and various other kingdoms. = Hiuen Tsang visits Jallandhar = After Samudragupta, the next mention of Trigarta is from Hieun Tsang who mentions Jallandhar being ruled by Udito. Hiuen Tsang visited Jalandhara in 635 A.D. and gave details that it was a country 1000 li (about 267 km) in breadth from north to south. = The Chamba Inscription and Invasion by Ghazni= Then, in the 8th century A.D, the Trigarta rulers acknowledged supremacy of the Karkota rulers of Kashmir. This is also mentioned in the Rajtarangini. From the 9th century to the 11th century, there are various mentions, one of the important ones being the 10th century Chamba inscription which mentions the Trigarta raja being subdued by Sahilavarman and then becoming an ally. It was also during this time that Ghazni entered the Kangra fort (1009 A.D.) while the Kangra forces were away on war. The ruler of the time was Jagdish Chandra. From that point on, save one or two rulers, all rulers of the Katoch dynasty vanshavali can be traced down to the last king. = Shifting of Capital from Jalandhar to Kangra = The Trigarta capital was moved from Jalandhara to Nagarkot(Kangra) in 1070 A.D. as mentioned due to constant contact in Jalandhar with various ambitious invading forces who usually were en route to middle India. = Ferishta's writings = Ferishta mentioned another account of the 1st century A.D. when the king of Kanauj, Raja Ram Deo, went on conquest and overran the hills. He spared Kumaon raja after getting his daughter in marriage, then he spared Nagarkot raja after the ruler offered his daughter in marriage. = Antiquity of Katoch Rulers and Nagarkot = Nagarkot (Kangra fort) was the citadel of Katoch lords who ruled Trigarta for thousands of years, right from Mahabharata period till pre-independent era, but as and when they lost their fort their power deserted them.  Katoch dynasty  The Katoch dynasty is an offshoot of Trigratraje Dynasty. It is claimed to have ruled this area and the above story from the Mahabharata is recorded in their history. Maharaja Susharma Chand had fought against Arjuna. His son built the Kangra Fort. Katoch Dynasty, in Kali Yuga, has also its famous sub clans as Jaswal Dynasty, Guleria Dynasty, Sibaia Dynasty, Chib Dynasty and Dadwal Dynasty.

It is situated centrally along the coastline of the parish of Christ Church. The area comprises a fishing village and a tourist area containing a collection of bars, rum shops and shopping arcades.  Etymology  It has been thought that the name \\"Oistins\\" is a corruption of \\"Austin's\\". Austin was an early landowner in this area, described by Richard Ligon, one of the first historians of Barbados, as \\"a wild, mad, drunken fellow whose lewd and extravagant carriage made him infamous in the island\\". The name Oistin is known from the annals of Irish and Highlands of Scotland history. It is probably a Gaelification of the Norse name Thorstein. The name Oistin is still used in Ireland today.  History  In a historical context, Oistins was known for being the location of the Treaty of Oistins Barbados charter, thought to have been signed at the site of the Mermaid's Inn, on 17 January 1652. The treaty was to bring a formal end to fighting between colonial settlers of Barbados and the English Commonwealth over Barbados right to trade with Spanish controlled Netherlands among other demands. Afterwards Oistins became the location of the Anglican parish church of Christ Church, the former Christ Church district hospital, and the former Barbados Coast Guard submarine station. In close proximity, many workers of Gerald Bull's Project HARP lived around Oistins and the nearby airport.  Tourism  A tradition has developed towards the end of the 20th century for tourists in Oistins to join with locals at the Friday night (and slightly quieter Saturday night) Fish Fry and \\"lime\\" (social gathering), which sees many food and drink stalls selling fried fish meals and local craft, all to the accompaniment of loud music, while older inhabitants practise more traditional 'old time' dancing. The area is fairly close to many of the south coast hotels in Barbados and has several beaches, for example Miami Beach. = Plane spotting = The beach at Oistins is situated on the usual flight path of many aircraft landing at the Grantley Adams International Airport and is therefore a popular aircraft spotting location. The area also acts as a small port with offshore landing for ships delivering fossils fuels to the island.Automated Manifest System Seaport Code: 27210.

Its capital was Sagala, modern Sialkot (in the Punjab province of Pakistan). The Kuru king Pandu's (PƒÅ·πá·∏çu) second wife was from Madra kingdom and was called Madri (; ; IPA/Sanskrit: ). The Pandava twins, Nakula and Sahadeva, were her sons. Madri's brother Shalya was the king of Madra. Though affectionate to the Pandavas, he was tricked to give support to Duryodhana and fought against the Pandavas during the Kurukshetra War. He was killed by Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava. Other than the Madra kingdom (Eastern Madra or Purva Madra) with Sagala as its capital, it is believed that there was a Western Madra (Apara Madra) and a Northern Madra (Uttara Madra). Origin According to the Vayu Purana, the Madra Kingdom was founded by King Ushinara Shibi of the Anu race. Anu was the son of Yayati. According to Bhagavata Purana, The kingdom of Madra was founded by Madra who was the son of Anu King Shibi in Treta Yuga. Madra Culture In the epic, the Madra culture is described to be different from the Vedic culture, prevailed in kingdoms of the Gangetic plain like the Kurus and Panchalas. Bahlika people were considered as \\"outsiders\\" of the Vedic culture, as being a foreign tribe of Bharatvarsha. However, one must not consider the Bahlikas as similar to Bahlikas in present Punjab region. The name Bahlika is also used to denote a kingdom different from Madra, Sindhu, Kekeya, GandhƒÅra & Kamboja. The Kuru king Shantanu, a forefather of Kauravas and Pandavas, had a brother who ruled the Bahlika Kingdom. Madra as a Bahlika country Bahlika or western countries were cold countries and people used blankets. They also reared sheep and drank sheep milk. They had good knowledge of camels. They had horses of excellent quality. Their horses and even horsemen were used in the wars between kings of Aryavarta (North Indian kingdoms where Vedic culture of the norm, prevailed). Their soldiers used to aid both the parties engaged in a battle on a payment basis. Probably this was the reason why Shalya, the Madra king, has to side with Duryodhana in the Kurukshetra War, since he was tricked to accept the payment for siding with Duryodhana. Another collective name denoting the western kingdoms is Arashtra or Aratta, meaning a kingless country. This raises the doubt, whether these countries were a republic ruled by elected chiefs, if we take the positive sense of the word. In a negative sense the word Arashtra can mean a kingdom with no control or with utter disorder. Origin of Madra tribe The Yavanas, the Kiratas, the Chinas, the Savaras, the Barbaras, the Sakas, the Tusharas, the Kankas, the Pathavas, the Andhras, the Madrakas, the Paundras, the Pulindas, the Ramathas, the Kamvojas were mentioned together as tribes beyond the kingdoms of Aryavarta. The Aryavarta-kings had doubts on dealing with them. (12,64) The Andrakas, Guhas, Pulindas, Savaras, Chuchukas, Madrakas, the Yamas, Kamvojas, Kiratas and Barbaras were mentioned as unknown tribes. In the Krita age, they were nowhere on earth (meaning Ancient India). It is from the Treta age that they have had their origin and began to multiply. When the terrible period came, joining Treta and the Dwapara, the Kshatriyas, approaching one another, engaged themselves in battle (12,206). The Madra tribe and Salwa tribe had a common origin as hinted by a myth at (1,121). Here the origin of these two tribes were attributed to a king in the race of Puru, known by the name of Vyushitaswa. His wife was Bhadra, the daughter of Kakshivat (Kakshivat was the son of Gautama-Dirghatamas, begotten upon the servant-maid of the queen of a king named Vali who ruled in the outskirts of Magadha. (See also Anga and Magadha). Seven sons were born to Bhadra, after the death of Vyushitaswa. Later they all became kings. Three of them became the three kings of Salwa and four of them became the four kings of Madra. :The myth describes that these seven kings were born of the dead-body of her husband! =Alliances of Madra brides with the Kurus= Madra Custom of Marriage Bhishma, the fatherlike guardian of Kuru king Pandu went to the capital of Madra, to ask for Shalya's sister as a bride to Pandu. Upon which Shalya replies:- \\"There is a custom in our family observed by our ancestors, which, be it good or bad, I am incapable of transgressing it. It is well-known, and therefore is known to thee as well, I doubt not.\\" The custom was that the groom had to give dowry to the kinsmen of the bride. Bhishma gave much wealth to Shalya and took Madri as the bride for Pandu (1,113). Pandava Sahadeva married Vijaya, the daughter of Dyutimat, the king of Madra, obtaining her in a self-choice ceremony and begat upon her a son named Suhotra. (1,95) =Kings of Madra= King Aswapati Aswapati was the son of Madra (the founder of Madra Kingdom) and grandson of King Shibi was the father of Savitri the famous princess of Madra, who became the lover (and later, wife) of the famous Salwa prince Satyavan. Aswapati's wife was from a minor tribe known as Malava. She was known as Malavi (3,291). The sons of Aswapati and Malavi, later became the powerful Malava kings. They spread their kingdom as far as Avanti (Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh). Thus the royal line of Malavas originated from the Madra (Punjab province of Pakistan) king Aswapati (3,297). King Shalya / Mukappan Shalya was the most famous king from Madra. He became the generalissimo of the Kaurava army on the last day of the Kurukshetra War. He was the oldest spear-fighter battled in Kurukshetra War.Bhima had defeated Shalya in mace-fight without knowing each other during the self-choice ceremony of Draupadi (1,192). He was slain by Pandava king Yudhishthira during the last day (18th day) of Kurukshetra War. Shalya was rated by Bhishma as an Athiratha( a great chariot-warrior) (5,166). Shalya was also skilled in knowledge of steeds and in driving the chariot on the battle-field (8,31). For this reason, Shalya was forced to be the charioteer of Karna for one day during the war. Shalya had two sons named Rukmangada and Rukmaratha (1,188). Rukmaratha was mentioned as participating in the war. Similarly many brothers of Shalya also participated in the war. His younger brother was slain by Abhimanyu (8,5). He is also called as Mukappan. There were other Madra kings like Dyutimat mentioned at (1,95) as the father-in-law of Pandava Sahadeva. =Nakula's arrival at Madra Kingdom= Nakula, during his military campaign to the west, to collect tribute for Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice came to the Madra Kingdom also Nakula the son of Pandu, by sheer force, reduced to subjection the Ramathas, the Harahunas, and various kings of the west. And while staying there Nakula sent, messengers unto Vasudeva Krishna. And Vasudeva with all the Yadavas accepted his sway. And the mighty hero, proceeding thence to Sakala, the city of the Madras, made his uncle Shalya accept from affection the sway of the Pandavas. The illustrious prince deserving the hospitality and entertainment at his uncle's hands, was well entertained by his uncle. Nakula obtained from Shalya a large quantity of jewels and gems, and left his kingdom. =Madra in Kurukshetra War= Madra king Shalya, came with an Akshouhini of troops to join the army of Pandavas, since his nephews viz the twins Nakula and Sahadeva were none other than the youngest Pandavas. His troops marched slowly on every day from Madra (Punjab province of Pakistan) to Upaplavya (somewhere on the border of Rajasthan and Haryana), the Matsya city, where the Pandavas were camped. When his army reached Kurujangala (the kingdom of the Pandavas, the modern-day Haryana), Duryodhana's men intercepted the army. They, without revealing their identity, received Shalya and his men, made tents for them and refreshed them with all comforts. The Madra soldiers also received payment from Duryodhana's officers for taking part in the Kurukshetra War. Shalya became indebted to battle for the sake of Duryodhana, by the time he learned the truth. (5,8). The main antagonist of Shalya in bow-fight was, king Yudhishthira (5,57). Both of them engaged many times in battle. (6-45 etc.). He also made many battles with Nakula and Sahadeva. He defeated many like Virata and Drupada. Shalya became the driver of Karna's chariot on the 17th day (8,36). On the last day Yudhishthira slew his uncle Shalya, who was then the generalissimo of the Kaurava army (9,17). Madra army battled along with other western armies like the Trigartas, the Kekeyas, the Gandharas, the Yavanas, the Sindhus, the Sauviras, the Amvasthas etc. (6-51 etc.). On the day when Shalya was forced to become the driver of Karna's chariot, a dispute arose between them (8-40,44). The passages that describe this dispute give light to the cultural-differences that existed between these warriors. (See Bahlika Culture for more details).

It was close to Madra Kingdom as both are mentioned together in many places. Saubha was its capital. Martikavati (alias Matika, Matrika, Matrikavati) also was mentioned as the capital of Salwa kingdom. The famous prince Satyavan was from Salwa. He married the Madra princess, Savitri, the daughter of Madra king Aswapati. Their history is a famous narration in Mahabharata. Seven chapters 3:291 to 3:297 is dedicated to this history of Satyavan and Savitri. References in Mahabharata =The common ancestry of Salwas and Madras= There was, in ancient times, a king in the race of Puru, known by the name of Vyushitaswa. He was devoted to truth and virtue. Vyushitaswa, who was endued with the strength of ten elephants very soon performed the horse-sacrifice, overthrowing, all the kings of the East, the North, the West and the South, and exacted tributes from them all. The seven children all of whom became king, three Salwas and four Madras were sons of Vyushitaswa. (1:121). =Location of Salwa Kingdom= Salwa kingdom is mentioned very close to Madra kingdom at (6:9) which describe kingdoms of Bharata Varsha. Another kingdom named Salwasena is mentioned close to Trigarta Kingdom. The Matsyas, the Panchalas, the Salways and the Surasenas were mentioned as not very far away from Kuru Kingdom at (5:54). King Jayadratha of Sauvira Kingdom is mentioned as travelling to Salwa Kingdom through Kamyaka woods. (3:262). =Salwa culture= Salwas were included in the kingdoms that falls in the larger circle of the mainstream culture propounded by the Kurus and Panchalas The Kauravas with the Pancalas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Naimishas, the Koshalas, the Kasapaundras, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, and the Cedis who are all highly blessed, know what the eternal religion is. (8:45). =King Dyumatsena of Salwa= Dyumatsena was the father of Satyavan, the famous prince who wedded the Madra princess Savitri. Section 3:292 describes the history of Dyumatsena:- There was, amongst the Salwas, a virtuous Kshatriya king known by the name of Dyumatsena. And it came to pass that in course of time he became blind. And that blind king possessed of wisdom had an only son. And it so happened that an old enemy dwelling in the vicinity, taking advantage of the king's mishap, deprived him of his kingdom. And thereupon the monarch, accompanied by his wife bearing a child on her breast, went into the woods. His son, born in the city, began to grow in the hermitage. The Brahmanas have named the son Satyavan. In his childhood he took great delight in horses, and used to make horses of clay. And he used also to draw pictures of horses. And for this that youth is sometimes called by the name of Chitraswa. The Madra princess Savitri knew about this prince and fell in love with him. Later she married him. Dyumatsena's minister somehow slew the enemy king and Dyumatesena regained his kingdom. =Salwa king contemporary to Bhishma= A Salwa king named Shalva Kumara (5:179) was mentioned as a lover of Amba, the eldest princess of Kasi Kingdom, who was abducted by Bhishma, a warrior from Kuru Kingdom, along with her sisters Ambika and Ambalika. Bhishma wished to make her the wife of Kuru prince Vichitravirya, but Amba wished to marry the Salwa king. Bhishma sent her to Salwa but the Salwa king rejected her. =Salwa king contemporary to Krishna= king salwa visiting kalayawana Yet another Salwa king (3:12, 7:11) attacked Dwaraka, this Salwa king was an ally of Shishupala, Dantavakra and Rukmi. According to the narration in the epic, he possessed an aircraft known as Saubha Vimana and used it for travel and for aerial warfare. In detail, according to mahabharata, when Krishna had gone for Pandavas Rajasuya, king of Saubha attacked his city Dwarawati. To encounter him, Samva, Charudeshna, Pradyumna(Rukmani son) came out. They speedily defeated enemy commander and made him flee the battle, and killed all of the Danavas aiding him in battle by fiery weapons. To fight enemy king, Krishna son Pradyumna challenged him. They first commenced an aerial battle and later for better encounter descended from their cars. They both started to pierce each other with greater weapons making other unconscious each time. At last when about to be killed, King Salwa retreated from battle. When Krishna returned, he found his city gardens and damsels devoid of beauty. Upon knowing everything that had happened, he promised them to slay his enemy. Krishna with his army marched for the attack and found King Salwa in an island pursuiting ocean coarse. And when battle began, both side started to shower arrows upon each other. Krishna started to kill all the Danavas aiding to the latter side. Seeing his side at loss, Salwa used an illusion causing enemy heroes to get confused of the environment and killed Krishna charioteer. And also made Vasudeva to get stuck in his illusion causing him to desist from fight. Later concluding in his mind that it was illusion he recovered his senses and started to fight afresh by discharging fiery weapons. Seeing this opponent Danavas showered mighty rocks upon them killing Krishna steeds but Krishna destroyed their shower by using thunderbolt as his weapon. At last, Krishna hurled his powerful discus Sudarshana and killed all the remaining tribes including Salwa. Killing everyone at the lord command it returned to Krishna. (See Dwaraka Kingdom for more details). =Impact of Magadha over Salwa= The eighteen tribes of the Bhojas, from fear of Magadha king Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west; so also have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the Patachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with the Kuntis. And the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and followers; and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas have all fled to the country of the Kuntis. (2:14). =Salwas in Kurukshetra War= A Salwa king allied with Duryodhana in Kurukshetra War (5:161). At (9:20) his final battle against the Pandavas is mentioned. A Salwa king has sided with Pandavas too in the Kurukshetra War. (7:23) Bhimaratha, (brother of Duryodhana), with six sharp shafts of great swiftness and made wholly of iron, despatched Salwa along with his steeds and charioteer to Yama‚Äôs abode. Salwakas along with Malavakas were mentioned as allies of the Pandavas ( 5:57). At (5:30) Salwakas were mentioned as fighting for Kauravas. =Other cultural references= *Son of Salwa is mentioned as present in the self choice ceremony at Panchala Kingdom.

It was invented by Hans Bethe in 1931 to find the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model Hamiltonian. Since then the method has been extended to other models in one dimension: the (anisotropic) Heisenberg chain (XXZ model), the Lieb-Liniger interacting Bose gas, the Hubbard model, the Kondo model, the Anderson impurity model, the Richardson model etc. Discussion In the framework of many-body quantum mechanics, models solvable by the Bethe ansatz can be contrasted with free fermion models. One can say that the dynamics of a free model is one-body reducible: the many-body wave function for fermions (bosons) is the anti- symmetrized (symmetrized) product of one-body wave functions. Models solvable by the Bethe ansatz are not free: the two-body sector has a non-trivial scattering matrix, which in general depends on the momenta. On the other hand, the dynamics of the models solvable by the Bethe ansatz is two-body reducible: the many-body scattering matrix is a product of two-body scattering matrices. Many-body collisions happen as a sequence of two-body collisions and the many- body wave function can be represented in a form which contains only elements from two-body wave functions. The many-body scattering matrix is equal to the product of pairwise scattering matrices. The generic form of the Bethe ansatz for a many-body wavefunction is Psi_M(j_1, cdots, j_M) = prod_{M geq a > b geq 1} text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) sum_{P in P_M} (-1)^{[P]} e^{i sum_{a=1}^M k_{P_a} j_a + frac{i}{2}sum_{M geq a > b geq 1} text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) phi(k_{P_a}, k_{P_b})} in which M is the number of particles, j_a, a=1, cdots M their position, P_M is the set of all permutations of the integers 1, cdots, M, k_a is the (quasi-)momentum of the a-th particle, phi is the scattering phase shift function and sgn is the sign function. This form is universal (at least for non-nested systems), with the momentum and scattering functions being model-dependent. The Yang‚ÄìBaxter equation guarantees consistency of the construction. The Pauli exclusion principle is valid for models solvable by the Bethe ansatz, even for models of interacting bosons. The ground state is a Fermi sphere. Periodic boundary conditions lead to the Bethe ansatz equations. In logarithmic form the Bethe ansatz equations can be generated by the Yang action. The square of the norm of Bethe wave function is equal to the determinant of the matrix of second derivatives of the Yang action. The recently developed algebraic Bethe ansatz led to essential progress, stating that The exact solutions of the so-called s-d model (by P.B. Wiegmann in 1980 and independently by N. Andrei, also in 1980) and the Anderson model (by P.B. Wiegmann in 1981, and by N. Kawakami and A. Okiji in 1981) are also both based on the Bethe ansatz. There exist multi-channel generalizations of these two models also amenable to exact solutions (by N. Andrei and C. Destri and by C.J. Bolech and N. Andrei). Recently several models solvable by Bethe ansatz were realized experimentally in solid states and optical lattices. An important role in the theoretical description of these experiments was played by Jean-S√©bastien Caux and Alexei Tsvelik.  Example: the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain  The Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain is defined by the Hamiltonian (assuming periodic boundary conditions) H = J sum_{j=1}^N boldsymbol{S}_{j} cdot boldsymbol{S}_{j+1}, qquad boldsymbol{S}_{j+N} equiv boldsymbol{S}_j. This model is solvable using Bethe ansatz. The scattering phase shift function is phi(k_a(lambda_a), k_b(lambda_b)) = theta_2 (lambda_a - lambda_b), with theta_n (lambda) equiv 2 arctan frac{2lambda}{n} in which the momentum has been conveniently reparametrized as k(lambda) = pi - 2 arctan 2lambda in terms of the rapidity lambda. The (here, periodic) boundary conditions impose the Bethe equations left[ frac{ lambda_a + i/2}{lambda_a - i/2} right]^N = prod_{b eq a}^M frac{lambda_a - lambda_b + i}{lambda_a - lambda_b - i}, qquad a = 1, ..., M or more conveniently in logarithmic form theta_1(lambda_a) - frac{1}{N} sum_{b = 1}^M theta_2(lambda_a - lambda_b) = 2pi frac{I_a}{N} where the quantum numbers I_j are distinct half-odd integers for N - M even, integers for N - M odd (with I_j defined mod(N)). Chronology * 1928: Werner Heisenberg publishes his model. * 1930: Felix Bloch proposes an oversimplified Ansatz which miscounts the number of solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for the Heisenberg chain. * 1931: Hans Bethe proposes the correct Ansatz and carefully shows that it yields the correct number of eigenfunctions. * 1938: Lamek Hulth√©n (de) obtains the exact ground-state energy of the Heisenberg model. * 1958: Raymond Lee Orbach uses the Bethe Ansatz to solve the Heisenberg model with anisotropic interactions. * 1962: J. des Cloizeaux and J. J. Pearson obtain the correct spectrum of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet (spinon dispersion relation), showing that it differs from Anderson‚Äôs spin-wave theory predictions (the constant prefactor is different). * 1963: Elliott H. Lieb and Werner Liniger provide the exact solution of the 1d Œ¥-function interacting Bose gas (now known as the Lieb-Liniger model).

Platform growth is mediated by sessile organisms whose skeletons build up the reef or by organisms (usually microbes) which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism. Therefore, carbonate platforms can not grow up everywhere: they are not present in places where limiting factors to the life of reef- building organisms exist. Such limiting factors are, among others: light, water temperature, transparency and pH-Value. For example, carbonate sedimentation along the Atlantic South American coasts takes place everywhere but at the mouth of the Amazon River, because of the intense turbidity of the water there. Spectacular examples of present-day carbonate platforms are the Bahama Banks under which the platform is roughly 8 km thick, the Yucatan Peninsula which is up to 2 km thick, the Florida platform,Geologic Map of Florida the platform on which the Great Barrier Reef is growing, and the Maldive atolls. All these carbonate platforms and their associated reefs are confined to tropical latitudes. Today's reefs are built mainly by scleractinian corals, but in the distant past other organisms, like archaeocyatha (during the Cambrian) or extinct cnidaria (tabulata and rugosa) were important reef builders. Carbonate precipitation from seawater What makes carbonate platform environments different from other depositional environments is that carbonate is a product of precipitation, rather than being a sediment transported from elsewhere, as for sand or gravel. This implies for example that carbonate platforms may grow far from the coastlines of continents, as for the Pacific atolls. The mineralogic composition of carbonate platforms may be either calcitic or aragonitic. Seawater is oversaturated in carbonate, so under certain conditions CaCO3 precipitation is possible. Carbonate precipitation is thermodynamically favoured at high temperature and low pressure. Three types of carbonate precipitation are possible: biotically controlled, biotically induced and abiotic. Carbonate precipitation is biotically controlled when organisms (such as corals) are present that exploit carbonate dissolved in seawater to build their calcitic or aragonitic skeletons. Thus they may develop hard reef structures. Biotically induced precipitation takes place outside the cell of the organism, thus carbonate is not directly produced by organisms, but precipitates because of their metabolism. Abiotic precipitation, by definition, involves little or no biological influence. Classification The three types of precipitation (abiotic, biotically induced and biotically controlled) cluster into three \\"carbonate factories\\". A carbonate factory is the ensemble of the sedimentary environment, the intervening organisms and the precipitation processes that lead to the formation of a carbonate platform. The differences between three factory is the dominant precipitation pathway and skeletal associations. In contrast, a carbonate platform is a geological structure of parautochotonous carbonate sediments and carbonate rocks, having a morphological relief. = Platforms produced by the \\"tropical factory\\" = In these carbonate factories, precipitation is biotically controlled, mostly by autotrophic organisms. Organisms that build this kind of platforms are today mostly corals and green algae, that need sunlight for photosynthesis and thus live in the euphotic zone (i.e., shallow water environments in which sunlight penetrates easily). Tropical carbonate factories are only present today in warm and sunlit waters of the tropical-subtropical belt, and they have high carbonate production rates but only in a narrow depth window. The depositional profile of a Tropical factory is called \\"rimmed\\" and includes three main parts: a lagoon, a reef and a slope. In the reef, the framework produced by large-sized skeletons, as those of corals, and by encrusting organisms resists wave action and forms a rigid build up that may develop up to sea-level. The presence of a rim produces restricted circulation in the back reef area and a lagoon may develop in which carbonate mud is often produced. When reef accretion reaches the point that the foot of the reef is below wave base, a slope develops: the sediments of the slope derive from the erosion of the margin by waves, storms and gravitational collapses. This process accumulates coral debris in clinoforms. The maximum angle that a slope can achieve is the settlement angle of gravel (30‚Äì34¬∞). = Platforms produced by the \\"cool-water factory\\" = In these carbonate factories, precipitation is biotically controlled by heterotrophic organisms, sometimes in association with photo-autotrophic organisms such as red algae. The typical skeletal association includes foraminifers, red algae and molluscs. Despite being autotrophic, red algae are mostly associated to heterotrophic carbonate producers, and need less light than green algae. The range of occurrence of cool-water factories extends from the limit of the tropical factory (at about 30‚ó¶) up to polar latitudes, but they could also occur at low latitudes in the thermocline below the warm surface waters or in upwelling areas. This type of factories has a low potential of carbonate production, is largely independent from sunlight availability, and can sustain a higher amount of nutrients than tropical factories. Carbonate platforms built by the \\"cool-water factory\\" show two types of geometry or depositional profile, i.e., the homoclinal ramp or the distally-steepened ramp. In both geometries there are three parts: the inner ramp above the fair weather wave base, the middle ramp, above the storm wave base, the outer ramp, below the storm wave base. In distally steepened ramps, a distal step is formed between the middle and outer ramp, by the in situ accumulation of gravel-sized carbonate grains = Platforms produced by the \\"mud-mound factory\\" = These factories are characterised by abiotic precipitation and biotically induced precipitation. The typical environmental settings where \\"mud-mound factories\\" are found in the Phanerozoic are dysphotic or aphotic, nutrient-rich waters that are low in oxygen but not anoxic. These conditions often prevail in the thermocline, for example at intermediate water depths below the ocean's mixed layer. The most important component of these platforms is fine-grained carbonate that precipitates in situ (automicrite) by a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic reactions with microbes and decaying organic tissue. Mud-mound factories do not produce a skeletal association, but they have specific facies and microfacies, for example stromatolites, that are laminated microbialites, and thrombolites, that are microbialites characterized by clotted peloidal fabric at the microscopic scale and by dendroid fabric at the hand-sample scale. The geometry of these platforms is mound-shaped, where all the mound is productive, including the slopes. Geometry of carbonate platforms Several factors influence the geometry of a carbonate platform, including inherited topography, synsedimentary tectonics, exposition to currents and trade winds. Two main types of carbonate platforms are distinguished on the base of their geographic setting: isolated (as Maldives atolls) or epicontinental (as the Belize reefs or the Florida Keys). However, the one most important factor influencing geometries is perhaps the type of carbonate factory. Depending on the dominant carbonate factory, we can distinguish three types of carbonate platforms: T-type carbonate platforms (produced by \\"tropical factories\\"), C-type carbonate platforms (produced by \\"cool-water factories\\"), M-type carbonate platforms (\\"produced by mud-mound factories\\"). Each of them has its own typical geometry. Generalized cross-section of a typical carbonate platform. = T-type carbonate platforms = The depositional profile of T-type carbonate platforms can be subdivided into several sedimentary environments. The carbonate hinterland is the most landward environment, composed by weathered carbonate rocks. The evaporitic tidal flat is a typical low-energy environment. An example of carbonate mud sedimentation in the internal part of the Florida Bay lagoon. The presence of young mangroves is important to entrap the carbonate mud. The internal lagoon, as the name suggests, is the part of platform behind the reef. It is characterised by shallow and calm waters, and so it is a low-energy sedimentary environment. Sediments are composed by reef fragments, hard parts of organisms and, if the platform is epicontinental, also by a terrigenous contribution. In some lagoons (e.g., the Florida Bay), green algae produce great volumes of carbonate mud. Rocks here are mudstones to grainstones, depending on the energy of the environment. The reef is the rigid structure of carbonate platforms and is located between the internal lagoon and the slope, in the platform margin, in which the framework produced by large-sized skeletons, as those of corals, and by encrusting organisms will resist wave action and form a rigid build up that may develop up to sea-level. Survival of the platform depends on the existence of the reef, because only this part of the platform can build a rigid, wave-resistant structure. The reef is created by essentially in-place, sessile organisms. Today's reefs are mostly built by hermatypic corals. Geologically speaking, reef rocks can be classified as massive boundstones. The slope is the outer part of the platform, connecting the reef with the basin. This depositional environment acts as sink for excess carbonate sediment: most of the sediment produced in the lagoon and reef is transported by various processes and accumulates in the slope, with an inclination depending on the grain size of sediments, and that could attain the settlement angle of gravel (30-34¬∞) at most. The slope contains coarser sediments than the reef and lagoon. These rocks are generally rudstones or grainstones. The periplatform basin is the outermost part of the t-type carbonate platform, and carbonate sedimentation is there dominated by density- cascating processes. The presence of a rim damps the action of waves in the back reef area and a lagoon may develop in which carbonate mud is often produced. When reef accretion reaches the point that the foot of the reef is below wave base, a slope develops: the sediments of the slope derive from the erosion of the margin by waves, storms and gravitational collapses. This process accumulates coral debris in clinoforms. Clinoforms are beds that have a sigmoidal or tabular shape, but are always deposited with a primary inclination. The size of a T-type carbonate platform, from the hinterland to the foot of the slope, can be of tens of kilometers. = C-type carbonate platforms = C-type carbonate platforms are characterized by the absence of early cementation and lithification, and so the sediment distribution is only driven by waves and, in particular, it occurs above the wave base. They show two types of geometry or depositional profile, i.e., the homoclinal ramp or the distally-steepened ramp. In both geometries there are three parts. In the inner ramp, above the fair weather wave base, the carbonate production is slow enough that all sediments may be transported offshore by waves, currents and storms. As a consequence, the shoreline may be retreating, and so in the inner ramp there may be a cliff caused by erosional processes. In the middle ramp, between the fair weather wave base and the storm wave base, carbonate sediment remains in place and can be reworking only by the storm waves. In the outer ramp, below the storm wave base, fine sediments may accumulate. In distally steepened ramps, a distal step is formed between the middle and outer ramp, by the in situ accumulation of gravel-sized carbonate grains (e.g., rhodoliths) only episodically moved by currents. Carbonate production occurs along the full depositional profile in this type of carbonate platforms, with an extra production in the outer part of the middle ramp, but carbonate production rates are always less than in the T-type carbonate platforms. = M-type carbonate platforms = M-type carbonate platforms are characterized by an inner platform, an outer platform, an upper slope made by microbial boundstone, and a lower slope often made by breccia. The slope may be steeper than the angle of repose of gravels, with an inclination that may attain 50¬∞. In the M-type carbonate platforms the carbonate production mostly occurs on the upper slope and in the outer part of the inner platform. The Cimon del Latemar (Trento province, Dolomites, northern Italy) represents the internal lagoon of a fossil carbonate platform. Continuous sedimentation took place in an environment as the one described in the image of the Florida Bay and, given a strong subsidence, led to the formation of a sedimentary series that therefore acquired considerable thickness. Carbonate platforms in the geological record Sedimentary sequences show carbonate platforms as old as the Precambrian, when they were formed by stromatolitic sequences. In the Cambrian carbonate platforms were built by archaeocyatha. During Paleozoic brachiopod (richtofenida) and stromatoporoidea reefs were erected. At the middle of the Paleozoic era corals became important platforms builders, first with tabulata (from the Silurian) and then with rugosa (from the Devonian). Scleractinia become important reef builders beginning only in the Carnian (upper Triassic). Some of the best examples of carbonate platforms are in the Dolomites, deposited during the Triassic. This region of the Southern Alps contains many well preserved isolated carbonate platforms, including the Sella, Gardenaccia, Sassolungo and Latemar. The middle Liassic \\"bahamian type\\" carbonate platform of Morocco (Septfontaine, 1985) is characterised by the accumulation of autocyclic regressive cycles, spectacular supratidal deposits and vadose diagenetic features with dinosaur tracks. The Tunisian coastal \\"chotts\\" and their cyclic muddy deposits represent a good recent equivalent (Davaud & Septfontaine, 1995). Such cycles were also observed on the Mesozoic Arabic platform, Oman and Abu Dhabi (Septfontaine & De Matos, 1998) with the same microfauna of foraminifera in an almost identical biostratigraphic succession. High Atlas middle Liassic carbonate platform of Morocco with first order autocyclic regressive cycles Metre-scale peritidal sedimentary cycles in two outcrops of the middle Liassic (early Jurassic) of Morocco. The two outcrops are 230 km apart. Storm beds and possibly tsunamites include abundant reworked foraminifera. This image is an example of the continuity of peritidal cycles in a carbonate platform environment. Virtual metric \\"shallowing upward sequence\\" observed all along (more than 10,000 km) the south Tethyan margin during middle Liassic times. The (micro)fossils are identical till Oman and beyond. In the Cretaceous period there were platforms built by bivalvia (rudists).  Sequence stratigraphy of carbonate platforms  With respect to the sequence stratigraphy of siliciclastic systems, carbonate platforms present some peculiarities, which are related to the fact that carbonate sediment is precipitated directly on the platform, mostly with the intervention of living organisms, instead of being only transported and deposited. Among these peculiarities, carbonate platforms may be subject to drowning, and may be the source of sediment via highstand shedding or slope shedding. = Drowning = Drowning of a carbonate platform is an event where the relative sea level rise is faster than the accumulation rate on a carbonate platform, which eventually leads to the platform to submerge below the euphotic zone. In the geologic record of a drowned carbonate platform, neritic deposits change rapidly into deep-marine sediments. Typically hardgrounds with ferromanganese oxides, phosphate or glauconite crusts lie in between of neritic and deep-marine sediments. Several drowned carbonate platforms have been found in the geologic record. However, it has not been very clear how the drowning of carbonate platforms exactly happen. Modern carbonate platforms and reefs are estimated to grow approximately 1,000 Œºm/yr, possibly several times faster in the past. 1,000 Œºm/yr growth rate of carbonates exceeds by orders of magnitude any relative sea level rise that is caused by long-term subsidence, or changes in eustatic sea level. Based on the rates of these processes, drowning of the carbonate platforms should not be possible, which causes \\"the paradox of drowned carbonate platforms and reefs\\". Since drowning of carbonate platforms requires exceptional rise in the relative sea level, only limited number of processes can cause it. According to Schlager, only anomalously quick rise of relative sea level or benthic growth reduction caused by deteriorating changes in the environment could explain the drowning of platforms. For instance, regional downfaulting, submarine volcanism or glacioeustacy could be the reason for rapid rise in relative sea level, whereas for example changes in oceanic salinity might cause the environment to become deteriorative for the carbonate producers. One example of a drowned carbonate platform is located in Huon Gulf, Papua New Guinea. It is believed to be drowned by rapid sea level rise caused by deglaciation and subsidence of the platform, which enabled coralline algal- foraminiferal nodules and halimeda limestones to cover the coral reefs. Plate movements carrying carbonate platforms to latitudes unfavourable for carbonate production are also suggested to be one of the possible reasons for drowning. For example, guyots located in the Pacific Basin between Hawaiian and Mariana Islands are believed to be transported to low southern latitudes (0-10¬∞S) where equatorial upwelling occurred. High amounts of nutrients and higher productivity caused decrease in water transparency and increase in bio-eroders populations, which reduced carbonate accumulation and eventually led to drowning. = Highstand shedding = Highstand shedding and slope shedding Highstand shedding is a process in which a carbonate platform produces and sheds most of the sediments into the adjacent basin during highstands of sea level. This process has been observed on all rimmed carbonate platforms in the Quaternary, such as the Great Bahama Bank. Flat topped, rimmed platforms with steep slopes show more pronounced highstand shedding than platforms with gentle slopes and cool water carbonate systems. Highstand shedding is pronounced on tropical carbonate platforms because of the combined effect of sediment production and diagenesis. Sediment production of a platform increases with its size, and during highstand the top of the platform is flooded and the productive area is bigger compared to the lowstand conditions, when only a minimal part of the platform is available for production. The effect of increased highstand production is enhanced by the rapid lithification of carbonate during lowstands, because the exposed platform top is karstified rather than eroded, and does not export sediment. = Slope shedding = Slope shedding is a process typical of microbial platforms, in which the carbonate production is nearly independent from sea level oscillations. The carbonate factory, composed of microbial communities precipitating microbialites, is insensitive to light and can extend from the platform break down the slope to hundreds of meters in depth. Sea level drops of any reasonable amplitude would not significantly affect the slope production areas. Microbial boundstone slope systems are remarkably different from tropical platforms in sediment productions profiles, slope readjustment processes and sediment sourcing. Their progradation is independent from platform sediment shedding and largely driven by slope shedding. Examples of margins that may be affected of slope shedding that are characterized by various contributions of microbial carbonate growth to the upper slope and margin, are: * the Canning Basin in Australia * the Guilin platform in the southern China * the Permian of the US Permian Basin * the middle Triassic carbonate platforms of the Dolomites.

Sindhu was a kingdom of ancient India mentioned in the epic Mahabharata and in the Harivamsa Purana. It stretched along the banks of river Sindhu (Indus) in ancient India, in modern Pakistan. It is often mentioned alongside the Sauvira Kingdom. It is believed that Sindhu kingdom was founded by Vrsadarbh, one of sons of Sivi. According to the Glimpses of Ancient Sindh, authored by Mirchandani, its capital was known as Vrsadarbhpura, and Tulsianis, later known as Sindhu, was located at or near the location of the present town of Mithankot (in southern Punjab). The inhabitants of the kingdoms were called Sindhus or Saindhavas. \\"Sindhu\\" literally means \\"sea\\". According to the epic Mahabharata, Jayadratha (the husband of Duryodhana's sister) was the king of Sindhus, Sauviras and Sivis. Probably Sauvira and Sivi were two kingdoms close to the Sindhu kingdom and Jayadratha conquered them, holding them for some period of time. Sindhu and Sauvira seem to have been two warring states fighting each other. Origin of the name \\"Sindhu\\" literally means \\"sea\\". It is now currently accepted that the Vedic-Sanskrit-speaking ancient Aryans had experience of migrating along the sea-shores of Africa, Arabia, and Iran and hence they were familiar with the concept of the sea. The name \\"Sindhu\\" was used first to denote this sea, the Arabian Sea, which much later came to be called the \\"Sindhu-Sagara\\". When they found a mighty river so wide that it looked like a sea, and settled there, they called it the Sindhu- river (Indus river). Thus the word Sindhu, which originally meant \\"sea\\", started to mean the mighty river which seemed as wide as a sea. References in the Mahabharata Sindhu (the Bhojas, the Sindhus, the Pulindakas) is mentioned as a separate kingdom of Bharata Varsha at (6:9). (Krishna- Dwaipayana Vyasa) The Kasmiras, the Sindhu Sauviras, the Gandharas (or Gandharvas) were mentioned as kingdoms of Bharata Varsha at (6:9). Sindhu and Sauvira are mentioned as a united country at many places, including (5:19), (6:51), (6:56), (7:107), (8:40), and (11:22). = Cultural affinity = Culturally, Sindhus were mentioned as similar to the Madras as per Karna: \\"The Prasthalas, the Madras, the Gandharas, the Arattas, those called Khasas, the Vasatis, the Sindhus and the Sauviras are almost as blamable in their practices.\\" (8:44) \\"One should always avoid the Vahikas, those impure people that are out of the pale of virtue, and that live away from the Himavat and the Ganges and Saraswati and Yamuna and Kurukshetra and the Sindhu and its five tributary rivers.\\" (8:44) = Military Habits = \\"The Gandharas (or Gandharvas), the Sindhus, and the Sauviras fight best with their nails and lances.

The Southerners are skilled in fighting sword in hand.\\" (12:100) = Battles between Sindhu and Sauvira = At (5:133) we find Kunti telling the story of Vidula who persuaded her son, who was the king of Sauvira but banished by the Sindhu king, to fight against the Sindhus and take back his kingdom from them: \\"The princess Vidula, one day, rebuked her own son, who, after his defeat by the king of the Sindhus, lay prostrate with heart depressed by despair.\\" (5:133) \\"It is true, the king of the Sindhus hath many followers. They are, however, all discounted. Rejoice, O son, and make thyself happy in the possession of wealth in the company of the daughters of the Sauviras and do not, in weakness of heart, be ruled over by the daughters of the Saindhavas.\\" (5:134) \\"Pierced by the wordy arrows of his mother, the son roused himself like a steed of proud mettle and achieved (defeating the Sindhus) all that his mother had pointed out.\\" (5:136) = Jayadratha and Sindhu kingdom = At (3:262) Jayadratha is mentioned as the son of Vriddhakshatra. Jayadratha is mentioned as the son of Sindhu at (1:188). Jayadratha is mentioned as of Sindhu's race at (5:142). Jayadratha is mentioned as the king of Sindhu, Sauvira and other countries at (3:265). The warriors of the Sivi, Sauvira and Sindhu tribes were under the command of Jayadratha (3:269). At (11:22) Jayadradha is mentioned as the king of Sindhu and Saivira. Apart from Dussala (1:117) (the sister of Duryodhana), Jayadradha had two other wives, one from Gandhara and the other from Kamboja (11:22). Jayadratha is mentioned as the sole ruler, governing \\"the rich countries of Saivya, Sivi, Sindhu and others\\" at (3:265). Jayadratha \\"had under his sway ten kingdoms,\\" of which Sindhu was the main kingdom (8:5). Jayadratha had also played a vital role in the battle of Kurukshetra, and was killed by Arjuna. On a particular day in the battle of Kurukshetra, due to the absence of Arjuna who was fighting elsewhere, Jayadratha was able to stop the Pandavas (except Arjuna) and helped kill Abhimanyu treacherously for Kauravas. =Sindhu in Kurukshetra War= In the Kurukshetra War, Sindhu sided with the Kauravas under their ruler Jayadratha. (6:71), (7:10,136) \\"Jayadratha of the country of the Sindhu, and the kings of the southern and the western countries and of the hilly regions, and Shakuni, the ruler of the Gandharas, and all the chiefs of the eastern and the northern regions, and the Sakas, the Kiratas, and Yavanas, the Sivis and the Vasatis with their Maharathas at the heads of their respective divisions joined the Kaurava army.\\" (5:198) \\"A silver boar adorned the standard-top of the ruler of the Sindhus.

(Tomorrow) I shall gratify all cannibals, rout the foe, gladden my friends, and crush the ruler of the Sindhus, viz. Jayadratha! A great offender, one who hath not acted like a relative, born in a sinful country, the ruler of the Sindhu, slain by me, will sadden his own. Thou shalt behold that ruler of the Sindhus, of sinful behavior, and brought up in every luxury, pierced by me with my shafts!\\" (7:73) = Sindhu breed of horse = Horses belonging to Sindhu breed were used extensively in the Kurukshetra War. (7:24) \\"[S]teeds consisting of the best of the Kamvoja breed as also of those born in the country of the Rivers, and of those belonging to Aratta and Mahi and Sindhu, and of those of Vanayu also that were white in hue, and lastly those of hilly countries\\" were the different types of horse employed in this war. (6:91) Steeds from Sindhu \\"were lean-fleshed, yet strong and capable of a long journey and endued with energy and strength of high breed and docility, free from inauspicious marks, with wide nostrils and swelling cheeks, free from faults as regards the ten hairy curls, [...] and fleet as the winds.\\" (3:71) =Sindhu River = \\"The river Sindhu (Indus) too is flowing with a current of fresh blood.\\" (3:223) \\"The seven large rivers including the Sindhu (Indus) though flowing eastwards then flowed in opposite directions.

Pollet (ed.), India and the Ancient world. History, Trade and Culture before A.D. 650 and early Buddhist literature and the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It is often mentioned alongside the Sindhu Kingdom. Its capital city was Roruka, identified with present-day Aror/Rohri in Sindh, mentioned in the Buddhist literature as a major trading center.Derryl N. MacLean (1989), Religion and Society in Arab Sind, p.63 According to the Mahabharata, Jayadratha was the king of the Sindhus, Sauviras and Sivis, having conquered Sauvira and Sivi, two kingdoms close to the Sindhu kingdom. Jayadratha was an ally of Duryodhana and the husband of Duryodhana's sister Dussala. The kingdom of Sauvira is also stated to be close to the Dwaraka and Anarta kingdoms. Modern equivalents The Sauvira people mentioned in the Mahabharata may also be related to the modern-day Saraiki people. Persian scholar Al-Beruni considered Sauvira to represent southwest Punjab, including Multan, Mithankot and adjacent areas in the region of the confluence of the Indus river with other rivers of Punjab in modern Pakistan. References to Sauvira in the Mahabharata = Cultural affinity = Culturally, the Sauviras were mentioned by the character Karna as being similar to the Madras: \\"The Prasthalas, the Madras, the Gandharas, the Arattas, those called Khasas, the Vasatis, the Sindhus and the Sauviras are almost as blamable in their practices.\\" (8:44) = Military habits = > The Gandharvas [or Gandharas], the Sindhus, and the Sauviras fight best with > their nails and lances. They are brave and endowed with great strength. > Their armies are capable of vanquishing all forces. The Usinaras possess > great strength and are skilled in all kinds of weapons. The Easterners are > skilled in fighting from the backs of war elephants and are proficient with > alternate fighting methods. The Yavanas, the Kamvojas, and those that dwell > around Mathura are well skilled in fighting with bare arms. The Southerners > are skilled in fighting sword in hand. (12:100) = Battles between Sindhu and Sauvira = In book 5, section 133 of the Mahabharata, the character Kunti tells the story of Vidula. Vidula persuaded her son, who was the king of Sauvira but banished by the Sindhu king, to fight against the Sindhus and take back his kingdom from them: \\"And the princess Vidula, one day, rebuked her own son, who, after his defeat by the king of the Sindhus, lay prostrate with heart depressed by despair.\\" (5:133) \\"Rejoice, O son, and make thyself happy in the possession of wealth in the company of the daughters of the Sauviras and do not, in weakness of heart, be ruled over by the daughters of the Saindhavas.\\" (5:134) \\"Pierced by the wordy arrows of his mother, the son roused himself like a steed of proud mettle and achieved [defeating the Sindhus] all that his mother had pointed out.\\" (5:136) = Kings of Sauvira =  Rahugan  There is a mention of King Rahugan meeting with Bharat followed by an extensive dialogue between them about life and its meaning.  Suvira  The kingdom of Sauvira was founded by Prince Suvira, one of the sons of Sivi. The neighboring kingdoms of Madra, Kekaya, and Sindhu belonged to Madraka, Kekaya, and Vrsadarbh, the other three sons of Sivi.  Jayadratha  Jayadratha was the king not only of Sauvira but of Sindhu and other countries as well. (3:265) The warriors of the Sivi, Sauvira and Sindhu tribes were under the command of Jayadratha. (3:269) In section 22 of book 11, Jayadradtha is again mentioned as the king of Sindhu and Saivira, and being married to ‚Äî besides Dussala (the sister of Duryodhana) ‚Äî two other wives, one from Gandhara and the other from Kamboja. Jayadratha is mentioned as the king of Sauvira at many places in the Mahabharata, such as in this conversation between Jayadratha's ally Kotika and Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas: > I am king Suratha's son whom people know by the name of Kotika, and that man > with eyes large as the petals of the lotus, sitting on a chariot of gold, is > the warrior known by the name of Kshemankara, king of Trigarta. And behind > him is the famous son of the king of Pulinda, who is even now gazing on > thee. Armed with a mighty bow and endued with large eyes, and decorated with > floral wreaths, he always liveth on the breasts of mountains. The dark and > handsome young man, the scourge of his enemies, standing at the edge of that > tank, is the son of Suvala of the race of Ikshwaku. And if, O excellent > lady, thou hast ever heard the name of Jayadratha, the king of Sauviras, > even he is there at the head of six thousand chariots, with horses and > elephants and infantry, and followed by twelve Sauvira princes as his > standard-bearers, named Angaraka, Kunjara, Guptaka, Satrunjaya, Srinjaya, > Suprabiddha, Prabhankara, Bhramara, Ravi, Sura, Pratapa and Kuhana, all > mounted on chariots drawn by chestnut horses.

The king is journeying in the company of these his > friends. (3:263)  Other Sauvira kings  A king named Satrunjaya among the Sauviras is mentioned at (12:139). The whole chapter consists of a conversation between this king and a sage in the Bharadwaja clan. > Arjuna and the other Pandava princes became so powerful that they slew in > battle the great Sauvira who had performed a sacrifice extending over three > years, undaunted by the raids of the Gandharvas [alternatively Gandharas]. > And the king of the Yavanas himself, whom the powerful Pandu even had failed > to bring under subjection, was brought by Arjuna under control. Then again > Vipula, the king of the Sauviras, endued with great prowess, who had always > shown a disregard for the Kurus, was made by the intelligent Arjuna to feel > the edge of his power. And Arjuna also repressed by means of his arrows (the > pride of) king Sumitra of Sauvira, also known by the name of Dattamitra[,] > who had resolutely sought an encounter with him. (1:141) A prajapati (patriarch) named Manu, and his descendants who ruled Sauvira, are described by Bhishma: > Manu had a son [...] of the name of the Ikshwaku. [...] His tenth son [...] > was named Dasaswa, and this virtuous prince of infallible prowess became the > king of Mahismati. Dasaswa's son [...] was known by the name of Madiraswa > and ruled over the Earth as her lord. He was constantly devoted to the study > of the Vedas as also of the science of arms. Madiraswa's son was the king > named Dyutimat who possessed great good fortune and power and strength and > energy. Dyutimat's son was the highly devout and pious king who was famous > in all the worlds under the name of Suvira. [...] Suvira too had a son who > was invincible in battle, and who was the best of all warriors and known by > the name of Sudurjaya.(13:2) King Suvira is also mentioned in Book 1, Section 67 as one of \\"many heroic kings on earth.\\" King \\"Ajavindu among the Suviras\\" is mentioned as an annihilator of his own race. (5:74) =Sauvira in the Kurukshetra War= In the Kurukshetra War, Sauvira sided with the Kauravas under their ruler Jayadratha. (6:71), (7:10,136) \\"In Bhishma's division were all the sons of Dhritarashtra, and also Sala, who was a countryman of the Valhikas, and also all those Kshatriyas called Amvastas, and those called Sindhus, and those also that are called Sauviras, and the heroic dwellers of the country of the five rivers.\\" (6:20) \\"The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, and the Vasatis, the Swalyas, the Matsyas, the Amvashtas, the Trigartas, and the Kekayas, the Sauviras, the Kitavas, and the dwellers of the eastern, western, and northern countries were all resolved to fight reckless of the lives.\\" (6:18) Those warriors that are opposed to Arjuna, viz., the Sauvirakas, the Sindhava- Pauravas, headed by Karna, are regarded as the foremost of car-warriors (7:108). \\"[M]any combatants also, belonging to the Nishadas, the Sauviras, the Valhikas, the Daradas, the Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Abhighatas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, the Vasatis, the Salwas, the Sakas, the Trigartas, the Amvashthas, and the Kekayas, similarly fell upon him\\" (Arjuna). (6:118) Bhishma the son of Santanu, protected by the warriors headed by Saindhava and by the combatants of the East and the Sauviras and the Kekayas, [fought] with great impetuosity. (6:52) \\"[T]he diverse tribes of the Sauviras, the Vasatis, and the Kshudrakas, and the Malavas, all these, at the command of the royal son of Santanu [Bhishma], quickly approached Kiritin [Arjuna] for battle.\\" (6:59) =Other references in the Mahabharata= * \\"Prompted by sinful motives, this one [meaning Shishupala of Chedi] ravished the reluctant wife of the innocent Vabhru (Akrura) on her way from Dwaraka to the country of the Sauviras.\\"(2:44) This is an indication of the ancient route that existed connecting Dwaraka and Sauvira. *\\"Manasyu [a king in the line of Puru] had for his wife Sauviri. And he begat upon her three sons called Sakta, Sahana, and Vagmi.\\" (1:94) (This may be coincidental.) *Shalya is mentioned as belonging to the Sauvira clan at (8:9). (This could be a translation error.) References in other classical texts According to the Bhagavata Purana, another Hindu text, the Sauviras were once connected with the Abhira tribe.

His influence over the king is said to have incurred the wrath of the aristocracy, culminating in a coup in which he was killed. There exists a good deal of controversy about the accuracy of the received story of his influence on the king, linked to broader issues about the reign of James III. These issues concern the theme of a king taking advice from low-born favourites rather than from established noble councillors. Story The traditional view is that James was a cultured man in the context of his time, but otherwise had some serious character flaws, a weak king and a dilettante who surrounded himself with a group of talented but low-born favourites. Cochrane was the most important of these favourites. He is said to have designed the Great Hall at Stirling Castle, and perhaps that at Falkland.Fiona Somerset Fry & Peter Somerset Fry, The History of Scotland, Routledge, London, 1992, p.111. To some extent he governed the country during the 1470s. He is said to have advised the king to debase the coinage in order to raise cash. He was opposed by the king's younger brothers, Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany and John Stewart, Earl of Mar. Mar was arrested and imprisoned, dying shortly thereafter; Albany escaped and gathered support in England. The king is said to have given Cochrane the title of Earl of Mar after his brother's death, though no record of this survives.N. A. T. Macdougall, ‚Äò‚ÄúIt is I, the earle of Mar‚Äù: in search of Thomas Cochrane‚Äô, R. Mason and N. A. T. Macdougall (eds.), People and Power in Scotland: Essays in Honour of T. C. Smout (Edinburgh, 1992), 28‚Äì49, 42‚Äì3. =Death= Cochrane's downfall came during an invasion by an English army led by the king's younger brother, the Duke of Albany, and the Duke of Gloucester, the future King Richard III of England. Albany had promised to give part of Scotland to England in exchange for being placed on the throne. A cabal of aristocrats, led by Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, decided that they must get rid of Cochrane and the other favourites in order to secure the Scottish crown. Angus chose to \\"bell the cat\\", as he put it. Cochrane and the king's other favourites were with the king's army at Lauder Bridge when a group of nobles refused to continue south to meet the enemy. Angus led the way by arresting Cochrane. The group then detained the king himself and hanged all the favourites from a bridge. Doubts about the story In the late 20th century much of this came to be questioned. Some historians have been more sympathetic to James III, seeing him as a cultured man in the relatively crude atmosphere of the Scottish nobility at that time, and defended him against some criticisms. The leading Scottish historian Norman Macdougall published a revisionist biography of James III in which he argues that, far from being a weak king, he was actually something of a tyrant. Macdougall dismissed the \\"favourites of low birth\\" as the invention of chroniclers in the next century whose knowledge of the facts was poor. He argues that all we can say for sure is that James had some dealings with an architect or mason called Cochrane, and the rest is later invention. Macdougall found two records of a Thomas Cochrane; one reference suggests that Cochrane was an usher of the king's chamber door, and the other that a Thomas Cochrane had forfeited the lands of Cousland near Dalkeith. Cochrane of Cousland, Macdougall concludes, may have been the usher and met his end at Lauder Bridge.Macdougall, (1982), 163-165 (Cousland was a source of building lime) Macdougall also follows the development of the story in later writers and points particularly to William Drummond of Hawthornden's History of the 5 Jameses for setting the final elaboration of the story. Macdougall argues that Hawthornden increased the status of Cochrane to that of an architect in order to rescue the king's reputation.Macdougall, (1982), 288-290. This view is not universally accepted by historians. This pattern of events, a royal favourite being assassinated by jealous nobles, occurred several times in late mediaeval and early modern Europe.

He played as a forward for several Italian clubs throughout his playing career, and he also played for Derby County in the Premier League, between 1997 and 1999.  Club career  During his career, Baiano played for several clubs. He first made his name with Foggia under Zdenƒõk Zeman, earning promotion to Serie A after winning the 1990‚Äì91 Serie B title, also winning the top-scorer award, with 22 goals, and forming a notable attacking trio alongside Giuseppe Signori and Roberto Rambaudi. He also played for Fiorentina, where he was a part of the so-called Ba-Ba strikers duo together with Gabriel Batistuta (he scored 29 goals in 118 games for Fiorentina), winning the 1995‚Äì96 Coppa Italia and the 1996 Supercoppa Italiana. During the 1992‚Äì93 Serie A season, he was the joint top assist provider in the league, with 12 assists, alongside Gianfranco Zola. Baiano later joined Derby County in 1997, along with compatriot Stefano Eranio; together, they were among the first group of Italian footballers to play in the Premier League. He hit 16 goals in 64 games in a resurgent Derby team and was named as one of their best ever imports by the fans. Baiano went on to play for Sangiovannese of Serie C1, a team he joined in 2002 to leave only in 2008 after a string of successful seasons with the small Tuscan side.  International career  Baiano won two international caps for Italy, both in late 1991, under Arrigo Sacchi, although he failed to score a goal at international level. He made his debut on 13 November 1991 in Genoa, in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Norway.  Style of play  A well-known, diminutive forward famous for his shooting technique and eye for goal, Baiano was also a quick, energetic, and dynamic player, with good technical ability and close control in tight spaces. Due to his pace, mobility, and agility, he was also often used as an outside forward; during his later career, he often played in a more creative role, as a supporting striker, or as an attacking midfielder, due to his creativity, as well as his ability to play off of teammates and provide them with assists.  Coaching career  In 2008, Baiano was appointed player/manager of Serie D club Sansovino with little success, leaving the club at the end of the season. In 2010, he re-joined his former boss Giuseppe Sannino, becoming his main assistant at Serie B club Varese. In 2011, he followed Sannino at Serie A club Siena, and then at Palermo in 2012. He was removed as Palermo assistant together with head coach Sannino on 16 September 2012.

He has also played for the West Zone in the Duleep Trophy and Gujarat, Mumbai cricket team and Maharashtra cricket team in domestic arena. In November 2018, he announced his retirement from cricket. He was born in Ikhar, Gujarat, India. He is a supporter of Youth Against Rape, a NGO started from instagram. Domestic career Patel first gained prominence in 2003 at the age of 20 before he had even played first class cricket for Gujarat, when he was invited to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai by the Indian chairman of selectors Kiran More. There he attracted the attention of visiting Australian captain Steve Waugh, and the director Dennis Lillee, a former Australian fast bowler, with his raw pace. With the backing of Sachin Tendulkar, he was signed by Mumbai in a transfer deal, in late 2003, without ever representing his native Gujarat. He was a part of Mumbai Indians till IPL 6 after playing three seasons with Rajasthan Royals, however, in 2014 IPL Auctions, he was unsold by having a low base price of 10 Lakhs only. In the tenth season of the Indian Premier League he was picked by Gujarat Lions for 30 lakh rupees. International career =Doorstep to national team= In 2004, he struggled with injuries, and was criticised by India A coach Sandeep Patil, who believed that he had a mental problem dealing with his injuries. He was also sent to Australian Institute of Sport for bio-mechanical analysis on his bowling action, to improve its efficiency. In August 2005, he transferred to Maharashtra, and after taking 10 wickets against England in a tour match for the Board President's XI, he was rewarded with his selection in the Indian Test Squad for the 2nd Test against England in Mohali, when he made his Test debut. Patel recorded the figures of 7/97 on debut, including 4/25 in the second innings and demonstrated an ability to swing the ball in both directions. =Early career= In the 2005‚Äì2006 Test Series against West Indies, Munaf proved he was arguably the fastest bowler in India, bowling regularly at speeds of over and has produced balls at a pace over the mark. However, more impressive than his ability to bowl at a very quick pace has been his control, a skill lacking in recent Indian fast bowlers. In the West Indies, however, Munaf suffered the ignominy of being hit for 6 fours in an over by Ramnaresh Sarwan. Patel fell short of the record of conceding the most runs off an over by 4 runs. In the second match of the DLF Cup in Malaysia, Munaf came up with figures of 3/54 against Australia, picking up the wickets of Phil Jaques, Michael Clarke and Stuart Clark. In the final game of the same tournament, he dismissed Australian captain Ricky Ponting for just 4, on the way to 1/32 off 9 overs. In the first match of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy against England, Munaf Patel again produced figures of 3/18 ‚Äì winning the match for India and gaining the man of the match award. =2007 World cup failure= He was part of the Indian 2007 World Cup squad which failed to progress from the group stage and played during India's One-day International series against Bangladesh shortly after the tournament before playing two games in England in August 2007. He took four wickets before being ruled out of the remainder of the series through injury. He was subsequently left out of the squad to play Pakistan in November although was recalled to the Test squad following injuries to R. P. Singh and S. Sreesanth.Sreesanth And RP Singh To Miss Opening Test, Cricket World, Retrieved on 20 November 2007 =2011 World Cup - SUCCESS= He was selected for the 2009 tour to Sri Lanka and played in the opening match. He bowled five wicketless overs for 32 runs. He then picked up a groin injury before the second match and was replaced in the squad by Lakshmipathy Balaji.Balaji replaces injured Munaf for SL tour, Cricinfo He was brought back into the ODI squad for India's last preparatory series before the 2011 World Cup, with the series taking place in South Africa. After India were beaten in the first match, they made only 190 when M. S. Dhoni chose to bat first in the second match. However, Patel put in a Man of the Match performance to return personal best figures of 4/29 off nine overs, taking the final wicket of Wayne Parnell to lead India to a 1-run victory, India's first against South Africa in South Africa since 2003. He was eventually named in India's World Cup squad. In India's first World Cup match against Bangladesh, Patel took four wickets, albeit with India defending a comfortable 370 run target. In the match against England, Patel's catch off his own bowling to dismiss Kevin Pietersen broke up an opening partnership in a match which England and India would eventually tie. He played an important role in the India Pakistan semi-final match at Mohali where he performed well and also played in the finals of the World Cup. He last played for India on the 2011 tour of England.

The Gothic Bible or Wulfila Bible is the Christian Bible in the Gothic language spoken by the Eastern Germanic (Gothic) tribes in the early Middle Ages. The translation was allegedly made by the Arian bishop and missionary Wulfila in the fourth century. Recent scholarly opinion, based on analyzing the linguistic properties of the Gothic text, holds that the translation of the Bible into Gothic was not or not solely performed by Wulfila, or any one person, but rather by a team of scholars.  Codices  Surviving fragments of the Wulfila Bible consist of codices and one lead tablet from the 5th to 8th century containing a large part of the New Testament and some parts of the Old Testament, largely written in Italy. These are: * Codex Argenteus, the longest and most celebrated of the manuscripts, which is kept in Uppsala, * Codex Ambrosianus A through Codex Ambrosianus E, containing the epistles, Skeireins (in a fragment of Codex Ambrosianus E known as the Codex Vaticanus Latinus 5750), and Nehemiah 5‚Äì7, * Codex Carolinus, a Gothic-Latin diglot palimpsest containing Romans 11‚Äì14, * Codex Gissensis, apparently also a Gothic-Latin diglot, containing fragments of the Gospel of Luke, * Gothica Bononiensia (also known as the Codex Boniensis), a recently discovered (2009) palimpsest fragment with what appears to be a sermon, containing direct Bible quotes and allusions, both from previously attested parts of the Gothic Bible (the text is clearly taken from Ulfilas' translation) and previously unattested ones (e.g. Psalms, Genesis).Carla Falluomini, 'Zum gotischen Fragment aus Bologna II: Berichtigungen und neue Lesungen', Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsches Altertum und Literatur 146.3 (2017) pp. 284-294. * Fragmenta Pannonica (also known as the H√°cs-B√©ndekpuszta fragments or the Tabella Hungarica), which consist of 1 mm thick lead plates with fragmented remnants of verses from the Gospels.  Historic context  During the third century, the Goths lived on the northeast border of the Roman Empire, in what is now Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania. During the fourth century, the Goths were converted to Christianity, largely through the efforts of Bishop Wulfila, who is believed to have invented the Gothic alphabet. The translation of the Bible into the Gothic language is thought to have been performed in Nicopolis ad Istrum in today's northern Bulgaria. Traditionally ascribed to Wulfila, in reality the translation was performed by a group of scholars (see above). Portions of this translation survive, affording the main surviving text written in the Gothic language. During the fifth century, the Goths overran parts of the Western Roman Empire, including Italy, southern France, and Spain. Gothic Christianity reigned in these areas for two centuries, before the re-establishment of the Catholic Church, and, in Spain, till the mass Gothic conversion to Catholicism in 589, after the Third Council of Toledo.  Modern importance  The Wulfila Bible, although fragmentary, is the only extensive document in an ancient East Germanic language and one of the earliest documents in any Germanic language. Since the other East Germanic texts are of very limited extent, except maybe Skeireins, it is of great significance for the study of these languages.  Text of The Lord's Prayer in the Wulfila Bible  atta unsar √æu in himinam, weihnai namo √æein. qimai √æiudinassus √æeins. wair√æai wilja √æeins, swe in himina jah ana air√æai. hlaif unsarana √æana sinteinan gif uns himma daga. jah aflet uns √æatei skulans sijaima, swaswe jah weis afletam √æaim skulam unsaraim. jah ni briggais uns in fraistubnjai, ak lausei uns af √æamma ubilin; unte √æeina ist √æiudangardi jah mahts jah wul√æus in aiwins. amen.

History Was introduced on 18 January 2007 under the Law 02/2007. It is based on a design first used when the country unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. The motto in Portuguese is \\"Unidade, Ac√ß√£o, Progresso\\" (\\"Unity, Action, Progress\\"). Description On the centre of the coat of arms, there a curved pyramid with red edges and black core, symbolise Mount Ramelau, the highest peak in Timor Leste. On the black field in the centre there is a five-pointed star with five rays of light. Under it there is an open red book rest upon a yellow industrial gear. On the left side there is a rice ear (hare fulin) and on the right side there is a corn ear (batar fulin). Under the industrial gear there is an AK-47 assault rifle, bow and arrows (rama inan). Under the Mount Ramelau there is a ribbon banner written in Portuguese: \\"Unidade, Ac√ß√£o, Progresso\\" (\\"Union, Action, Progress\\"). Around the emblem there is a circle band written with the official name of the state in Portuguese: \\"Rep√∫blica Democr√°tica de Timor-Leste\\" (Democratic Republic of East Timor), and the acronym is written under \\"RDTL\\". Previous emblems = Portuguese colonisation (1935‚Äì1975) = In 1935, the Portuguese colonies were officially assigned coats of arms that followed a standard design pattern. The arms of Portuguese Timor followed the same format of other Portuguese colonies (later overseas provinces) with the territory being represented by the black and white Dominican cross in recognition of the role played by the Dominican Order in converting the East Timorese to Roman Catholicism. = Indonesian occupation (1975‚Äì1999) = Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year as its 27th province of Timor Timur. During this period, Timor Timur had its own coat of arms which remained in use until Indonesia rescinded its annexation in 1999. The arms consisted of a golden shield containing wreaths of wheat and cotton enclosing a blue roundel containing a stylised traditional East Timor house. This was surmounted by a blue shield depicting a gold star representing the faith in one God. Below the roundel appeared a traditional Timorese headdress (Kaibauk) bearing the inscription \\"Timor Timur\\". = United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (1999‚Äì2002)= The seal used by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) depicted an outline of the island of Timor, a crocodile, traditional head-dress and tais patterns. The seal included the words Timor Lorosa‚Äôe and Governu in Tetum or Timor Leste and Governo in Portuguese. = First coat of arms (2002‚Äì2007) = The first coat of arms contains the shield of the Conselho Nacional de Resist√™ncia Timorense (National Council of Timorese Resistance). The main elements are two crossed Suriks (traditional Timorese swords), together with a spear, a star, and two arrows. The country's title, in Portuguese, is on a blue ring around the shield and a sun with 14 rays. The motto in the banner translates as: \\"Honour, Homeland, and People\\".

There was a king named Shivi who became famous as Shivi or the kingdom itself may be named after him. Shivi (alias Sibi, Saivya) king was famous for his truthfulness. The legend about his truthfulness and compassion goes as follows: King Shivi protected a dove who was chased by a hawk (which wanted to eat the dove as its midday meal), and gave flesh from his thigh, as a substitute meal to the hawk. It is also mentioned in the epic that Jayadratha was the king of Sindhu, Sauvira and Shivi kingdoms. Probably Sauvira and Shivi were two kingdom close to the Sindhu kingdom and Jayadratha conquered them, which would place Shivi somewhere in western Rajasthan though alternatively it could also be Sibi, Balochistan which is to the west of Sauvira and Sindhu and adjacent to both. Jayadratha was an ally of Duryodhana and husband of Duryodhana's sister Dussala. It is also mentioned that Yudhishthira, king of Hastinapur after the great Kurukshetra War, married a beautiful girl Devika of the Sivi tribe, and she later begot a son to him, Yaudheya, from whom the Yaudheyas claim their descent.https://web.archive.org/web/20100116130453/http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m01/m01096.htm Geographical locations According to Sivi J√°taka, king Sivi (as Bodhisatta) had ruled Sivirattha with his capital at Aritthapura (Aristapura of Sanskrit) and is said to have donated his eyes to a blind BrahmanaSivi J√°taka No. 499. Chinese traveler Faxian records the scene of this story at So-ho-to (Swat), a country to the south of Oddiyana between the Kabol and the Indus rivers.Records of the Past, 1913, p. 85ff, Henry Mason Baum, Frederick Bennett Wright, Records of the Past Exploration Society, George Frederick Wright, Records of the Past Exploration Society, Washington, D. C. - Archaeology; Also: Publications, 1904, pp 234/235, Thomas Watters, Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and IrelandOriental Translation Fund . In some versions, Sivi appears as a personal name but in others it is the name of the country and its people. According to 7th-century Chinese monk and traveller Xuanzang, Sivika (Sibika) had cut his body to pieces to save a dove from a hawk. Xuanzang described Sivika as a personal name or an epithet. Chinese envoy Song Yun (518-20 AD) also refers to Sivika raja (Sivi king) and connects him to Oddiyana. Thus, the Chinese evidence connects king Sivi/Sivika and the Sivi people or country with the Oddiyana/Swat territory between the Kabol and Indus rivers, which forms part of modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Aritthapura of the Buddhist Sivi Jataka is same as the Orobatis of Alexander's historians.Eggermont, Pierre Herman Leonard (1993), Alexander's campaign in Southern Punjab. Dep. Ori√´ntalistiek(Leuven), pp 68-75, 85-90. B. C. Law connects Jataka's Aritthapura with Ptolemy's Aristobothro in the north of Punjab.Tribes of Ancient India, p. 83, B. C. Law. It has been identified with Shahbazgarhi region, north of river Kabol.Eggermont, Pierre Herman Leonard (1975).

National Pub. House (New Delhi, India), p. 199. . Dr S. B. Chaudhury also states that Aritthapura of the Sivi Jataka points to Swat valley as the ancient country of the Sivis.Chaudhuri, Sashi Bhusan (1955). Ethnic Settlements in Ancient India: a Study on the Puranic Lists of the Peoples of Bharatavarsa. General Printers and Publishers, p. 91. Matsya Purana says that Indus flowed through the Janapada of Sivapura (country of the Sivis). There is also another Buddhist legend known as Vessantara Jataka which states that king Vessantara was the son of Sa√±jaya (king of Sivirattha or Sivi-Rashtra) and was born in the capital city of Jatuttara. King Vessantara as a Bodhisatta had given away his magical elephant (which could bring rain on the asking) to a hostile country, and also his kingdom as well as his family with two children to a greedy Brahmana, all as acts of benevolence and generosity.Vessantara JƒÅtaka No. 547. Envoy Sung Yun makes reference to king Vessantara of Vessantara Jataka (as Pi- lo) while pilgrim Xuanzang refers to him (as Sudana) and both place the scene of history in the Oddiyana/Swat, north of Kabol river. But the Jatuttara of Vessantara Jataka is taken to be same as Jattaraur of Al-Biruni Biruni, Muhammad ibn Ahmad (1910). Al-Biruni's India. K. Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Co. (London), vol II, p 302. and is often identified with Nagri or Tambavati Nagri, 11 miles north of Chittore in Rajputana.Raychaudhuri, G. C. (1940).

In this connection, N. L. Dey has observed that there were two countries called Sivi---one located in Swat (Oddiyana) with its capital at Aritthapura and the second is the same as the Sivika of Varahamihira See ref: Brhat Samhita, XIV.v-12, Varahamihira. which he places among the countries of the south-west with its capital at Jatuttara in Madhyamika (south-west Rajputana).The geographical dictionary of ancient and mediaeval India, 2007 Edition, p 81, Nundo Lal Dey; History of Mewar from the Earliest Times to 1303 A.D., 1940, p 8, G C Raychaudhuri; Tribal Coins of Ancient India, 2007, p 110, Devendra Handa; Ethnic Settlements in Ancient India: (a Study on the Puranic Lists of the Peoples of Bharatavarsa), 1955, p. 47, Sashi Bhusan Chaudhuri - Ethnology. It has also been suggested that Sivi was originally a geographical name from which the name of its ruler and that of its people may have been derived.Records of the Past, 1913, p 86, Henry Mason Baum, Frederick Bennett Wright, Records of the Past Exploration Society, George Frederick Wright, Records of the Past Exploration Society, Washington, D. C. - Archaeology. In the Mahabharata, the name Sivi is connected with Asura and like Kamboja, it is also linked to the mythological goddess Diti.Mahabharata, 1.67.1-34. The Brahmanical texts also mentions that king Sivi was son of king Usinara and was from Anava (Anu) lineage. While referring to a certain Sakya legend connected with 'Oddiyana locale' (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan), James Fergusson connects the Oddiyana country with the Kamboja of the Hindu texts.Tree and Serpent Worship Or Illustrations of Mythology & Art in India: In the 1st and 4th Century After Christ, 2004 edition, p 48, J. Fergusson. Indeed, the territories of Kunar, Oddiyana, Swat and Varanaos had been the notable habitats of the Asvaka Kambojas since remote antiquity. The Asvakas were cattle breeders and horse folk and had earned the epithet of Asvakas due to their intimate connections with the Asvas (\\"horses\\"). The Sivis, as described by Alexander's historians, \\"were a shaved- headed people, worshipers of god Shiva, wore clothes made from animal skins, and were warlike people who fought with the clubs...most of these are also the salient characteristics of the ancient Kambojas\\". Mahabharata refers to the Kambojas as Munda (\\"shaved-headed soldiery\\").Mahabharata 7.119.23. See also: Ganapatha 178 on PƒÅ·πáini's rule II.1.72 - Mayuravyamsakad'i' which calls the Kambojas Munda (i.e. Kambojah Munda, Yavana Munda); Also the Kambojas are described as Mundas in numerous Puranas, e.g. see: Brahma Purana, verse 8.48. In the same Mahabharata text, Rudra Siva is also given the epithet of Munda.IHQ, 1963, p 291. The Kambojas are also attested to have been ardent worshipers of Siva-cult (Munda-cult).The Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol 23-24, 1947-48, pp 290/291, N. Chaudhuri-India.The Kamboja rulers of Bengal were also Siva-devotees; see Bengal - Past and Present, 1916, p 209, Calcutta Historical Society; Comprehensive History of Bihar, 1974, p 259, Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha, Syed Hasan Askari. The Kamboja rulers of Kambodia/Kambuja were also Sivia worshippers (see Studies in Sanskrit Inscriptions of Ancient Cambodia, 2003, p 229, Mahesh Kumar Sharan, Mahesh Kumar Sharan Abhinav.Cf: \\"There were Dionysiac festivals in honor of god Siva who belonged to Asvaka district, north of Kabul river where flourished thye vine-orchards\\" (See: Coins and Icons, A Study of Myth and Symbols in Indian Numistmatic Art, 1977, p 128, Bhaskar Chattopadhya). See: Article Ashvakas for Ashvakas/Kambojas identity. In fact, the Mahabharata evidence shows that the promulgator of synthetic Siva cult was one sage Upamanyu, son of Vyaghrapada. Upamanyu was a disciple of Ayodha Dhaumya who taught at Taxila University in Gandhara.Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, 1969, p 332, Dr R. K.

Guruge (Note: Guruge also takes note of the ethnic connections between the ancient Kambojas, sage Upamnayu of the Rig Veda and his son/descendant Kamboja Aupamanyava of Vamsa Brahmana of Sama Veda, as implied in the Rig Vedic verse 1.102.09); Literary History of Ancient India in Relation to Its Racial and Linguistic Affiliations, 1950, p. 165; The Racial History of India - 1944, p 810, Chandra Chakraberty etc. Since \\"Munda\\" is an epithet of god Rudra-Siva, it has also been suggested that the Sivis derive their name from god Siva whom they ardently worshiped. It appears likely that the Sivis originally lived in north of river Kabol in remote antiquity, from where sections of them moved southwards in later times and settled in what is called Seva around Bolan Pass, which region was known as Sivistan till recently. PƒÅ·πáini also mentions a place called Sivapura which he includes in the Udichya (northern) division of Ancient India Patanjali Mahabhasya IV.2.2; Vedic Index Vol II, p 382, IHQ, 1926, p 758. and which is identified by some scholars with Sibipura of the Shorkot Inscriptions edited by Vogel. The southerly movement of the Sivis is also evidenced from their other settlement called Usinara near Yamuna, ruled by Sivi king called Usinara.Mahabharata III.130-131,; Political History of Ancient India, 1996, pp 224, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury. Sivis also are attested to have one settlement in Sind, another one in Madhyamika (Tambavati Nagri) near Chittore (in Rajputana) and yet another one on the Dasa Kumara-chrita on the banks of the Kaveri in southern India (Karnataka/Tamil Nadu).Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 224, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury; Note: The southern Sivis are probably identified with Chola ruling family (See: List of Southern Inscriptions, 685, Kielhoen; Op cit., 1996, p 224, H. C. Raychaudhury. It is mentioned in the epic that Jayadratha was the king of Sindhu, Sauvira and Sivi kingdoms. Sauvira and Sivi were two kingdom close to the Sindhu kingdom and Jayadratha conquered them, which would place Sivi somewhere in Balochistan which is to the west of Sauvira and Sindhu and adjacent to both. Some writers think that Sivi may have been originally located at the foot of Bolan Pass from there they might have extended their influence to Oddiyana/Swat but this is unlikely. Taking clue from Yaska's Nirukta,Nirukta 2.2 (Kambojah Kambal.Bhojah Kamaniya.Bhoja va) S. Levi states that \\"the Kambhojas were a branch of the Bhojas and were not a part of the Aryans (i.e Indo Aryans)\\".Pre-Aryan and Pre- Dravidian in India, 1992, p 123 sqq, Sylvain L√©vi, P. Levi, Jules Bloch, Jean Przyluski, Asian Educational Services - Indo-Aryan philology. The name \\"Kambhojas\\" is etymologised as Kamblala + Bhojas (\\"the Bhojas with Kambalas or blankets\\") as well as Kamniya + Bhojas (meaning \\"The handsome Bhojas or the desirable Bhojas\\"). Thus, Levi and others have connected the ancient Bhojas with the Kambhojas. Both Kambojas and the Bhojas are also referred to as north-western people in the 13th Rock Edict of king Asoka. Thus, the Kambojas appear to have either been anciently and inadvertently confused with the Bhojas who were a Yadava tribe, or, else, there was indeed some kind of link between the Bhojas and the ancient Kambhojas as S. Levi suggests.Sylvain L√©vi, P. Levi, Jules Bloch, Jean Przyluski.See also: Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland, 1889, p 288/89 (Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland); Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland, 1834, p 272 (Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland); Encyclopedia of Religions or Faiths of Man Part 2, Volume 2 2, 2003 edition, 282, J. G. R. Forlong. Writers like James F. K. Hewitt and others also connect the Sivis, Bhojas and the Drhuyus with the Kambhojas.Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland, 1889, p 288/89, James F. K. Hewitt; Op cit., 282, J. G. R. Forlong. The Chinese evidence on king Sivi as well as king Vessantara (Sudana, Saniraja or Pi-lo of the Chinese records), the rulers of Oddiyana (in pre-Buddhist times) also seems to lend a fair credence in this direction.

The epic Ramayana mentions One of the wives of Dasharatha, the king of (Ayodhya)and father of Raghava Rama, was from Kekeya kingdom and was known as Kaikeyi. Her son Bharata conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Gandhara and built the city of Takshasila. Later the sons and descendants of Bharata ruled this region from Takshasila. In Mahabharata, five Kekaya princes were mentioned, who joined the Pandavas in Kurukshetra War. The eldest of them was described as a king and was known as Vrihatkshatra. These Kekaya brothers were also banished from their kingdom by their own kinsmen, like the Pandavas who were banished from their Kuru Kingdom, by their cousin brothers viz the Kauravas headed by Duryodhana. Thus these Kekaya brothers were circumstantially inclined to ally with the Pandavas. Besides this, the Kekaya brothers were sons of the sister of Kunti, the mother of Pandavas, making them cousins. In Kurukshetra War, the Kekaya brothers fought against their own kinsmen, viz the other Kekaya brothers who sided with Duryodhana.  References in Mahabharata  Kekaya is mentioned as an ancient Indian (Bharata Varsha) kingdom at (6,9). = Alliances of Kekaya brides with Puru kings = *Puru king Sarvabhauma married Sunanda, the daughter of the Kekaya prince, having obtained her by force. (1,95) *Puru king Parikshit's son Bhimasena married Kumari, the princess of Kekaya and begot upon her Pratisravas whose son was Pratipa, the father of Santanu. (1,95) = Kekaya Kings =  King Sahasrachitya  There was a ruler of the Kekayas, named Sahasrachitya and he was the grandfather of king Satayupa, who was the contemporary of Kuru king Dhritarashtra. Abdicating his kingdom to his eldest son, king Sahasrachitya retired into the woods. (15,20)  King Satyayupa  Satayupa was the great king of the Kekayas. Having made over the sovereignty of his kingdom to his son he had come into the woods. Kuru king Dhritarashtra, after the Kurukshetra War was over, installed the victorious Pandava king Yudhishthira, on the throne of the Kuru capital, Hastinapura. He then retired to woods. Then Satayupa, received king Dhritarashtra with due rites. Accompanied by him, the latter proceeded to the retreat of Vyasa. Arrived at Vyasa‚Äôs retreat, Dhritarashtra received his initiation into the forest mode of life. Returning he took up his abode in the retreat of Satayupa. The high-souled Satayupa, instructed Dhritarashtra in all the rites of the forest mode, at the command of Vyasa. (15,19)  King Vrihatkhsatra  The Kekaya brothers (five each) who fought the Kurukshetra War, on the side of Pandavas as well as on the side of Kauravas, belonged to the next generation of Kekaya's royal family. The foremost of them was Vrihatkshatra, the eldest of the brothers who sided with the Pandavas. He was described as a king of Kekaya. He had a son named Visoka, who also fought in Kurukshetra War.  Kekaya bowmen Dyumatsena  Not much is known about this warrior from Kekaya except the following passages. After Bhima‚Äôs education was finished from Bala Rama, he became in strength like unto Dyumatsena himself. (1,141). Dyumatsena, the chief of bowmen among the Kekayas was present in Yudhishthira's court, newly inaugurated at Indraprastha (2,3). = Kekaya's friendship with the Pandavas = The five Kekaya princes, allied with the Pandavas, visited the Pandavas when they were banished into woods along with other Pandava allies viz Vasudeva Krishna, Dhristadyumna and Dhrishtaketu (3-12,22,51,120), (5,55). When Drupada, the father-in-law of the Pandavas, decided to summon the kings of Ancient India, for the cause of Pandavas, in Kurukshetra War, Kekayas was one among the first in the list. (5,4). = The five Kekaya brothers, on the Pandava side = The five Kekaya brothers who battled on the Pandava side in Kurukshetra War is mentioned at many places (5-61,83,144). At (7,10) they were mentioned as maternal cousins of the Pandavas. At (5,22) is mentioned:- deposed from the throne of the Kekaya land, and desirous of being reinstated thereon, the five mighty brothers from that land, wielding mighty bows, are now following the Pandavas ready to fight. The Panchalas, the Kekayas, and the Matsyas, along with the very herdsmen that attend on their kins and sheep, are rejoicing and gladdening Yudhishthira (5-50,53). The five brothers of Kekaya, all having purple flags, have joined the Pandavas, with an Akshauhini of troops. (5,57). The five royal brothers of Kekaya, accepted the Kekaya warriors (on Dhritarashtra‚Äôs side) as antagonists. And in their share are included the Malavas also, and the Salwakas, as also, the two famous warriors of the Trigarta host who have sworn to conquer or die. (5,57). The princes of Kekaya, and Dhrishtaketu, and the son of the king of the Kasis, and Srenimat, and Vasudana, and the invincible Sikhandin, all hale and hearty, cased in armour and armed with weapons and decked with ornaments, marched behind Yudhishthira (5,152). = The hundred Kekaya brothers on Kaurava side = Kekayas on Kaurava side is mentioned at many places (5-19,30,198), (6,16) The five Kekaya brothers, (probably those who sided with Duryodhana) were equated with the five Asuras viz Ayahsira, Aswasira, Aysanku, Gaganamurdhan, and Vegavat. (1,67) Jayadratha (the brother-in-law of Duryodhana), assisted by the Kekayas, endeavoured to ravish Draupadi (the wife of Pandavas) (11,22) The five royal brothers, the princes of Kekaya, hastened to Duryodhana with an Akshauhini of troops, and gladdened his heart. (5,19). Kekayas were mentioned along with the Vasatis, the Salwakas, the Amvashthas, and the Trigartas as allies of Duryodhana at (5,30). The Kekayas on the Kaurava side marched under Drona along with Vinda and Anuvinda, both of Avanti and the Vahlikas. (5,198). 100 Kekaya brothers were generals in the Kaurava army along with others like Vinda and Anuvinda, of Avanti (6,16). The camp of the Kekayas used to have loud sound of song and slapping of palms which their soldiers, engaged in dance and revelry, used to make. (7,84) = The appearance of Kekaya brothers on Pandava side = The Kekaya brothers, were all of the hue of Indragopaka insects (mix of red and black colors) (5,141). All of them had purple flags (5,57). The five Kekaya brothers, resembling (in hue) the insects called Indragopakas, had red coats of mail, red weapons and red banners. (7,10). The five Kekaya brothers were borne by steeds of deep red hue. They were of the splendour of gold and had standards of the red hue, and were decked with chains of gold (7,23). The five Kekaya brothers are lying on the ground, slain by Drona. Their coats of mail, of the splendour of heated gold, and their tall standards and cars and garlands, all made of the same metal, are shedding a bright light on the earth like so many blazing fires. (11,25) = Kekayas in Kurukshetra War =  On Pandava Side  (7-21,83,107), (8-3, Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, became protectors of Arjuna‚Äôs car-wheels, along with the Kekaya brothers, and Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana of great valour. (6,19). The Kekaya brothers at the head of their troops, encountered in battle the five Gandhara princes with their troops. (6,45). *Kekaya king is mentioned as fighting for the Pandavas at (6,52). *The king of the Kekayas, owning an akshauhini, formed the right wing of a Pandava battle-array (6,69). The five Kekaya brothers consisted the left wing of another array at another day of the war (6,75) *Dushasana fought with the five Kekaya brothers. (6,79) *The chief of the Kekayas, who was equal to Bhima himself in battle and surrounded by Kekaya warriors, has been slain by Kekaya, the brother by the brother. (8,6) *1700 Kekaya troops, skilled in smiting, united with a body of the Panchala troops checked the Kauravas trying to capture Yudhishthira. (8,62) *Drona, with his swift-going shafts, slew all the Kaikeyas (7,152) *The five Kekaya brothers are lying on the ground, slain by Drona. (11,25) = Battles of Vrihadkshatra = Kripa rushed against Vrihadkshatra, the ruler of the Kaikeyas. (6,45). Excellent steeds of the Sindhu breed, of beautiful limbs, and of the hue of the smoke of straw, quickly bore the Kaikeya prince, Vrihatkshatra. (7,23). Vrihatkshatra and others rushed against Drona (7,33). The mighty car-warrior among the Kaikeyas, viz., Vrihatkshatra, incessantly scattering keen shafts that resembled the thunder in force, proceeded towards Drona; then Kshemadhurti of great fame quickly rushed against Vrihatkshatra (7,103). Having slain his foe, Kshemadhurti, the mighty car-warrior Vrihatkshatra became filled with joy (7,104). Vrihadkshatra and others rushed against Ashwathama (7,198). = Death of Vrihatkshatra = The mighty car- warrior of the Kaikeyas, Vrihatkshatra the eldest of five brothers, rushed against Drona, the generalissimo of the Kauravas. He baffled Drona's Brahma weapon with his Brahmna weapon. Drona, with a third shaft well-shot from his bow, pierced Vrihatkshatra himself in the chest. Thereupon, the latter, thus struck in the chest, fell down from his car, slain. (7,122).(8,5) = Death of Kekaya Prince Visoka and Kekaya commander Ugrakarman = Karna slew Visoka, the son of the ruler of the Kaikayas. Upon the slaughter of the Kaikaya prince, the commander of the Kaikaya division, Ugrakarman, rushed with speed and striking Prasena, Karna's son. Then Karna, with three crescent- shaped arrows, cut off the arms and the head of his son‚Äôs assailant. (8,82)  On Kaurava Side  The Abhishahas, the Surasenas, the Sivis, and the Vasatis, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Amvashtas, the Trigartas, and the Kekayas, the Sauviras, the Kitavas, and the dwellers of the Eastern, Western, and the Northern countries,--these twelve brave races protected the Kaurava generalissimo, Bhishma. (6,18) *Kekayas along with the Trigartas, the Matsyas (Matsays in the western region) and the Vatadhanas were mentioned as part of the Kaurava army at (6,56) *The Trigartas and the Madras, with the Kekayas, numbering 25000 urged by Duryodhana, surrounded Arjuna (6,61) *The mighty car- warrior, the son of the ruler of the Kaikeyas stayeth on the field for battling for Duryodhana's sake. (8,6) = Kekaya and Avanti = At some places in Mahabharata people of Avanti is mentioned as Kekayas. This could be an oral-transmission error crept into Mahabharata, or a translation error, or could mean some tribal-link between Avanti and Kekaya. Similar to other western rulers, like the Kambojas, the Kekayas also had migrated to east, hence in principle, could reach Avanti. In fact, in Ramayana, there is some indication of a Kekaya kingdom in the eastern sea-shore ! *Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, with their troops encountered Virata, the ruler of Matsyas at the head of his forces. That awful encounter between the Matsyas and the Kekayas was terrible. (7,23). *Satyaki (a Pandava general, belonging to the Yadava clan, who was a disciple in arms, of Arjuna) checked the Kaikaya princes Vinda and Anuvinda. The two Kaikaya princes, in that battle, shrouded Satyaki. Satyaki shrouded the Kaikaya brothers. Satyaki cut the head of Anuvinda with a razor arrow, sorrowing the Kaikeyas. Satyaki next slew Vinda in a sword fight. Amazingly these Vinda and Anuvinda resemble in name to the two other princes named Vinda and Anuvinda who were from Avanti. They however were slain by Arjuna (7,96) = Other References = *A lady named Sumana of Kekaya‚Äôs race is mentioned at (13,123) *Conversation of Kaikeya King and a Rakshasa is mentioned at (12,76)  Reference in Bhagavata Purana  The five Kekaya brothers were the sons of Kunti's sister Srutakirti, wedded to Kekaya king Dhristaketu. Kunti's sister Srutadevi was wedded to the Karusha king Vriddhasarma, whose son was Dantavakra. Kunti's sister Srutasravas was married to the Chedi king Damaghosha whose son was Shishupala. Kunti's sister Rajadhidevi was married to the Avanti king.

They have released four albums to date, the latest full-length of which was released through Dim Mak on March 10, 2009. They played their final show on August 28, 2010 at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, California. Overview From Monument to Masses is an instrumental post-rock power trio composed of Francis Choung (drums, keys, programming), Sergio Robledo-Maderazo (bass, keys, samples), and Matthew Solberg (guitar, loops). From Monument To Masses is officially a \\"bi-coastal\\" band with two members living in the California Bay Area (Robledo-Maderazo, Solberg) and one residing in New York City (Choung). The band formed in 2000 in the San Francisco area, and eventually signed to Dim Mak Records in 2002. The band's first album, From Monument To Masses, was initially intended to be a demo recording to find a label; however, when Dim Mak's label owner Steve Aoki, who was also a long-time friend of Robledo-Maderazo from the Southern California Hardcore scene and his UCSB classmate, heard the recording, he signed the band and decided to release it as an eponymous debut LP. The band name is a challenge to the \\"Great man theory\\" and a call for a paradigm shift. Rather than subscribe to the notion that \\"highly influential individuals\\" to whom monuments are built shape historical developments, the band name posits that it is actually the masses struggling for change who make history. In several interviews, that band has cited the American Civil Rights Movement as an example and note the hard work of hundreds of organizers that often gets overshadowed in history books by admittedly important individuals. The band members have often explained in interviews that their music is only one expression of their respective politics. Each member has been involved with various organizations throughout the life of the band, including the League of Filipino Students-SFSU, Challenging White Supremacy, Kalayaan School for Equity, BAYAN USA, and others.

It is named after Rudolph Valentino, an Italian actor, who presented with right lower quadrant pain in New York, which turned out to be a perforated peptic ulcer. He subsequently died from an infection and organ dysfunction in spite of surgery to repair the perforation. Due to his popularity, his case received much attention at the time and is still considered a rare medical condition. However, the degree of peritoneal findings is strongly influenced by a number of factors, including the size of perforation, amount of bacterial and gastric contents contaminating the abdominal cavity, time between perforation and presentation, and spontaneous sealing of perforation.  Signs and Symptoms  Patients with perforated Valentino's syndrome usually present with a sudden onset of severe, sharp abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), that is similar to acute appendicitis. Most patients describe generalized pain; a few present with severe epigastric pain, located in the upper abdominal area. As even slight movement can tremendously worsen their pain, these patients assume a fetal position. These patients may also demonstrate signs and symptoms of septic shock, such as tachycardia (increased heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and anuria (when no urine is produced from the kidneys). Not surprisingly, these indicators of shock may be absent in elderly, immunocompromised patients or in those with diabetes. Patients also experience nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and sweating.  Cause  The cause for Valentino‚Äôs syndrome is due to a perforated ulcer located in the duodenum. This occurs when ulcers that have gone untreated for long periods of time, and as a result has burned through the stomach wall. Risk factors for a perforated ulcers include bacterial infection, such as H. pylori, and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The right lower quadrant pain is caused by peritonitis from exposure to gastrointestinal fluids. However, the exact reason for Valentino's syndrome to occur is idiopathic.  Pathophysiology  Peptic ulcers are sores or defects that arise from tissue death, that develop in the mucosal lining of the stomach or duodenum. When a peptic ulcer bursts, the gastrointestinal or duodenal fluid leaks through it and pools in the right paracolic gutter which leads to inflammation of the peritoneum resulting in symptoms right lower quadrant of abdominal pain. Patients also develop pneumoretroperitoneum, which is air in the retroperitoneum, caused by intraperitoneal perforation in the duodenum. Untreated peptic ulcers can often lead to greater complications such as hemorrhage, obstruction, and cancer.  Diagnosis  Diagnosing Valentino's syndrome could be very difficult because of the condition's many similarities to appendicitis. However, a medical history of ulcers and use of NSAIDs could be an indicator. When patients present with right lower quadrant pain their vitals, such as blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, and temperature, are monitored. A complete blood count (CBC) is done to determine the number of white blood cells present in the patient‚Äôs blood and test for leukocytosis, a condition in which the white blood cells are above the normal levels. Abdominal examination usually discloses generalized tenderness, rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa, guarding, and rigidity. A physical examination that is positive for abdominal pain categorized as McBurney‚Äôs point tenderness, Von Blumberg's sign, Rovsing's sign, Dunphy's sign and Psoas sign, could all indicate acute appendicitis and lead to misdiagnosis. However, these physical examination findings are also present in Valentino‚Äôs Syndrome. In order to diagnose Valentino's syndrome, a CT or ultrasound may be performed, which would reveal a ruptured peptic ulcer and free fluid surrounding the area of the appendix. Diagnosis through laparoscopy can also be done to distinguish between acute appendicitis and Valentino‚Äôs syndrome. Since there has been very few cases of Valentino's syndrome recorded to this day, most studies on this condition include observations of the patient from onset to recovery and on site medical decision making. As more cases are noted and awareness increases, misdiagnosing Valentino's syndrome can be prevented and properly managed.  Treatment  Treatment would include emergency surgery in order to repair the ruptured peptic ulcer. This is done by irrigation with saline solution, draining excess fluid, and surgically closing the perforation. Patients are then observed for a certain period of time before being discharged when no post-operative complications arise and are advised to follow up with their physician for post-operative examination.

He was vice-president of news and public affairs at CJOH-DT, the CTV station in Ottawa, Ontario. Keeping was anchor of the local evening news broadcast from 1972 until his retirement in 2010 and was the station's community ambassador until March 2012. Biography Keeping was born in Grand Bank, Newfoundland and began his news career in the late 1950s. His early work was as sports director of the St. John's Evening Telegram, a post that he occupied at the age of 16. He then worked with the radio station VOCM and CJCH in Halifax. Keeping moved to Ottawa in 1965, when he became a parliamentary reporter first for CFRA radio, and then as a parliamentary reporter for CTV News. Keeping returned to Newfoundland in the fall of 1972 to run as a Progressive Conservative in the October federal election, in the riding of Burin‚ÄîBurgeo. He came in second place behind the Liberal incumbent, Don Jamieson, with 25% of the vote. After the election he returned to Ottawa. Due to his political campaign, he was unable to return to his parliamentary bureau job at CTV. In November 1972, he joined CJOH as the local news director and was the station's news anchor from November 1972 until March 2010, making him one of the longest-serving Canadian television news anchors. In his more than 40 years in Ottawa, Keeping became a local celebrity. He played an active role in many charitable drives, both through his news station, and outside. He was the long-time Master of Ceremonies of the CHEO telethon. It is estimated that he has participated in the collection of more than $100 million in charitable donations in the Ottawa area. This earned him a 2003 Gemini Humanitarian Award. Most recently Keeping accepted a doctorate from the University of Ottawa and an honorary post as patron for Learning for a Cause, a non-profit educational initiative which publishes and promotes the creative writing of high school students. In 2003, Keeping announced on-air that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Later that year, a section of CHEO was named the Max Keeping Wing in recognition of his support for the hospital. Keeping announced on 3 December 2009 that he would retire as news anchor after 26 March 2010. On the same newscast, it was announced that his replacement would be Graham Richardson of CTV News's parliamentary bureau, who appeared on the air with Keeping and fellow anchor Carol Anne Meehan to make the announcement.

Gandhara prince Shakuni was the root of all the conspiracies of Duryodhana against the Pandavas, which finally resulted in the Kurukshetra War. Shakuni's sister was the wife of the Kuru king Dhritarashtra and was known as Gandhari after the area of GandhƒÅra (which is in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan). Puskalavati, Takshasila (Taxila) and Purushapura (Peshawar) were cities in this Gandhara kingdom. Takshasila was founded by Raghava Rama's brother Bharata. Bharata's descendants ruled this kingdom afterwards. During the epic‚Äôs period, the kingdom was ruled by Shakuni's father Suvala, Shakuni and Shakuni's son. Arjuna defeated Shakuni's son during his post-war military campaign for Yudhishthira's Aswamedha Yagna. Janamejaya, a Kuru king in Arjuna's line, conquered Takshasila, probably then ruled by the Naga Takshaka. He conducted a massacre called Sarpa Satra meaning the slaughter of the snakes, in which the Naga race was nearly exterminated. This massacre was stopped by a Brahmin named Astika, whose mother was a Naga. Nagas were considered as a super human tribe, in Puranas. Naga literally means a Serpent or a serpent-god. The Nagas could be a group of people who inhabited India during epic periods who worshiped snakes. It is speculated that another super human tribe called the Gandharvas were originally inhabitants of the Gandhara kingdom. Gandharvas were well versed in music and art. This explains why there is much Gandhara influence in Indian Classical Music. Gandhara form of sculpturing is also famous (very close to Greek sculpturing). The Yadava chief Bala Rama saw many Gandharva settlements on the banks of Saraswati River, not far from Gandhara, during his pilgrimage over Saraswati river basin. The Gandharva Kali and Dwapara, probably were princes from Gandhara. The last two Yugas (prehistoric periods) were named after them. Kuru King Dhritarashtra's wife was from Gandhara (a Gandharvi) and she was well known by the name Gandhari. There was a Gandhrava also by the name Chitrangada. (See Gandharva Kingdom).  References in Mahabharata  = Gandhara, a kingdom in Bharata Varsha = Gandhara is mentioned as a hilly country at (5,30). ---In the Krita age ', they were nowhere on earth.

His sister Gandhari was the mother of Duryodhana. Subala was present in the self-choice event of Draupadi and in the Rajasuya sacrifice of Pandava king Yudhishthira. Shakuni was a skilled dice-player. (2,57).

It is considered as the national dance of Tonga and part of the intangible human heritage. It is the ideal dance at formal occasions, like the birthday of the king or the opening of a church. History The current lakalaka seems to be quite equal to the ancient meelaufola (outstretched arms dance) of which descriptions exist from early European discoverers. But the dance was forbidden by the missionaries as too heathen. This was confirmed in the 1850 code of king TƒÅufaƒÅhau Tupou I. But an article to that effect was absent from the 1862 code, while it was back again in 1885. In any case none of these laws specified exactly what was meant with 'heathen dance'. There are reports of some huge dance festivals during these times and no one was ever arrested. Admittedly the pre-missionary p≈çmee (night dances) in which afterwards couples disappeared in the bushes, they did not occur anymore. The lakalaka as it is known nowadays is usually accredited to have been invented towards the end of the 19th century by a high chief, who was a Methodist preacher as well, Tukuaho (1858‚Äî1897), from Tatakamotonga. Considering that in practice dancing had never been quit, it is probably better to say that he revitalised it. He used missionary approved nursery rhymes and added some simple gestures and steps. People agreed, and they came with suggestions, which, not so surprisingly were quite the same as those of the not forgotten meelaufola. So a new dance was born, and yet afterwards seen, it was still the same. But now it was silently approved by the missionaries. Choreography The lakalaka is a living dance in the sense that new compositions are still daily made. Often when a celebration is coming up, a punake (poet) will write the lyrics to the occasion, assign music to the stanzas from a pool of typical tunes and then choreograph the haka (dance movements). Nevertheless, there are lakalaka which have become so famous that they can generally be used at any occasion. Among them several made by Queen SƒÅlote, like Takafalu, Nailasikau, SƒÅngone, Otu langi, Tuaikaepau, and so forth. The dance movements of men and women are different. Most of the time the women make small steps to the left and right only, and their arm movements are small and fluid. Nevertheless, the arm movements are farther away from the body (laufola, outstretched arms) than for example with the mƒÅuluulu. The movements of the men are wilder and more vigorous. In addition to small steps, they may at times turn around, sit down or even lie down. In any case, how different their haka on first glance may be, both men and women interpret the words of the songs, but in a symbolic, allusive way as so typical for Tongan dance. The dancers are standing in one or more rows, depending on the number of participants. 2 dozen per row is about fine. The men to the right, the women to the left as seen from the public. Behind them the chorus; the lakalaka is a sung dance, there is none or very little instrumental accompaniment. Sometimes in the middle of some lakalaka there are stanzas with a different type of lyrics and music than the rest, called the sipa. During the sipa the men move to the left, the women to the right, the two groups passing through each other, until their order is reversed. At the next stanza they move back to their original positions. The dance normally starts with the singing of the first stanza by both dancers and chorus, which is a deference to the god, the king and the chiefs of the country. On the next stanza dancing starts. First calmly and subdued, but toward the end becoming wilder and wilder, while the tempo of the beat goes up as well. Everybody gets excited, both the performers and the public. Performers The lakalaka from Kanokupolu for the 70th birthday of the king of Tonga. Princess Pilolevu Tuita as vƒÅhenga The persons in the middle of the front row, on the division line between the two gender are known as the vƒÅhenga (central performer). These are the persons with the highest rank of the group, often a prince or princess. The one who is perceived as really the most important, either the male or female vƒÅhenga usually is also wearing a uniform different from the rest. The other vƒÅhenga is then dressed the same as the other performers. The two last positions, that is at the very ends of the frontrow, the fakapotu, are also reserved for high-ranking persons. The second positions, beside the vƒÅhenga are known as tƒÅofi vƒÅhenga and are for the next ranking persons. The third positions are filled with the best dancer of the male and female group respectively, the mƒÅlie taha. All the other positions can be filled up at the wish of the dancemaster. It is for a dance group a high honour if a prince or princess or noble will participate as vƒÅhenga. This can only be done on occasions where the king is the guest of honour, like his birthday or the centenary of a church and the like. Because all Tongan dances, especially formal ones like the lakalaka are in fact a deference to the chiefs. Tongan society is very stratified. Everybody has a particular rank. The royal family on top, the chiefs below it, and so forth. One cannot pay homage to someone lower in rank. Therefore, people higher in rank than the guest of honour at a particular celebration cannot dance. A king or queen can never dance, whatever gifted performer he or she was when young and a mere prince or princess. Dress The normal dress of the dancers is as formal as the dance. Often an either white or black tupenu with shirt and a taovala loukeha, although this all may be largely covered by a sisi an ornamental girdle of leaves and fragrant flowers and/or a manafau a grassskirt, but in reality made of hibiscus fibers. In addition likewise made anklets, wristlets and neck garlands are worn too. The dancers from the village of Kanokupolu, however, always perform in their traditional folaosi, an about 2 meter piece of ngatu. The dancers of Tatakamotonga, who often perform last on big occasions, because they are claimed to be the best, always dress in black, as whether they still mourn for Tukuaho (see below) and his son Tungƒ´ Mailefihi, the consort of Queen Salote Tupou III. Also worn is a tekiteki a little bunch of chicken feathers stuck in the hair. For the women the feathers are usually glued to one or two small sticks, pointing up, while for the men it is a soft tuft hanging down. Especially the women's tekiteki enhances the small, left- right head nods teki, they make from time to time on the beat of the music. A proper teki is considered as one of the most important actions in order to be classified as a good dancer. References *I. F. Helu; Critical essays; 1999; *A.L.

The regulation, first drafted in 1997, underwent a \\"rapid act revision\\" in January 2005; it provides policy for the creation of labor programs and prison camps on Army installations. The labor would be provided by persons under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Labor programs  Labor programs set forth by the Civilian Inmate Labor Program regulation involve the use of minimum and low-security inmates from facilities under the control of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, with a few apparent exceptions for state-held and locally-held inmates, on installations controlled by the Army. Army Regulation 210-35 outlines two purposes for this docket: # Provides Army policy and guidance for establishing civilian inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army installations. # Discusses sources of federal and state civilian inmate labor. The regulation states that labor programs benefit the Army and the corrections facilities by supplying \\"a source of labor at no direct cost to the Army\\", giving \\"meaningful work to inmates\\" and alleviation to \\"overcrowding in nearby corrections facilities\\" and by making use of otherwise unused land and buildings. The statement of purpose of the regulation is as such:https://web.archive.org/web/20101215155945/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/R210_35.PDF This policy provides army policy and guidance for establishing civilian inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army installations. Sources of civilian inmate labor are limited to: # On- and off-post federal corrections facilities # State and/or local corrections facilities operating from on-post prison camps pursuant to leases under section 2667, title 10, United States Code, allowing for any residents of camps deemed by the secretary of defense to promote the public interest or be a matter of national security to be used for this program. # Off-post facilities participating in the demonstration project authorized under Section 1065, Public Law (PL) 103-337, otherwise state and/or local inmate labor from off-post corrections facilities is currently excluded from this program. The regulation indicates that the inmates could perform labor as allowed by 18 USC 4125(A).  Prison camps  The regulation also sets forth policy for the creation of prison camps on Army installations. These would be used to keep inmates of the labor programs resident on the installations. In January 2006, Kellogg, Brown and Root reported that they had received a contract from the Department of Homeland Security to expand ICE DRO facilities \\"in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs.\\" A February news article comments that the \\"new programs\\" mentioned could include the Civilian Inmate Labor Program.

History The council was convened at Nablus by Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. It established twenty-five canons dealing with both religious and secular affairs. It was not quite a church council, but not quite a meeting of the royal court; according to Hans Mayer, due to the religious nature of many of the canons, it can be considered both a parlement and an ecclesiastical synod. The resulting agreement between the patriarch and the king was a concordat, similar to the Concordat of Worms two years later.Hans E. Mayer, \\"The Concordat of Nablus\\" (Journal of Ecclesiastical History 33 (October 1982)), pp. 531-533. The council established the first written laws for the kingdom. It was probably also where Hugues de Payens obtained permission from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem to found the Knights Templar. Malcolm Barber, The Trial of the Templars (Cambridge University Press, 1978), pg. 8 The council was not mentioned in the chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres, who served in the retinue of Baldwin II and must have been present. This is probably because the nature of the canons, dealing as they do with the crimes and sins of the Latin population, contradicted Fulcher's portrayal of the Kingdom as a Christian utopia. William of Tyre, writing about sixty years later, included a detailed account of the proceedings, but neglected to record any of the canons themselves, which he felt were well-known and could be found in any local church; however, he also probably wanted to avoid the implication that the early Kingdom was not as heroic as his generation remembered it.Mayer, pp. 541-542. Although the canons may have been well known in William's time, only one copy, located in a church in Sidon, seemed to survive the Muslim reconquest of the Kingdom. This copy made its way to Europe where it was in the papal library at Avignon by 1330. It is now located in the Vatican Library, MS Vat. Lat. 1345. A copy was edited in the Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio of Giovanni Domenico Mansi in the 18th century, and more recently a new edition has been published by Benjamin Z. Kedar in Speculum (Vol. 74, 1999). Kedar argues that the canons are largely derived from the Byzantine Ecloga, promulgated by Leo III and Constantine V in 741. Kedar believes that the canons were put into practise in the 12th century,Benjamin Z. Kedar, \\"On the Origins of the Earliest Laws of Frankish Jerusalem: The Canons of the Council of Nablus, 1120\\" (Speculum 74 (1999)), pp. 330-331. although Marwan Nader disagrees, since they were not included in the Livre des Assises de la Cour des Bourgeois and other Assizes of Jerusalem, which were written in the 13th century.Marwan Nader, Burgesses and Burgess Law in the Latin Kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus (1099-1325) (Ashgate, 2006), pg. 156. Content The canons begin with the reasons for calling the council: Jerusalem had been plagued with locusts and mice for the past four years, and the Crusader states in general were suffering from repeated attacks from the Muslims. It was believed that the sins of the people needed to be corrected before Jerusalem could prosper. Canons 1-3 deal with tithes to the church. Canon 1 is a promise by King Baldwin to surrender the appropriate tithes to the Patriarch, namely those from his own royal estates in Jerusalem, Nablus and Acre. In canon 2 Baldwin seeks forgiveness for the tithes he had previously withheld, and Warmund absolves him of this sin in canon 3. This shows that the church was able to assert its rights in the Crusader Kingdom, a victory in the Investiture Conflict still raging in Europe.Mayer, pp. 537-541. Canons 4-7 deal with adultery. Canon 4 outlines punishments for a man who is suspected of committing adultery with the wife of another man; first, he is to be forbidden from visiting the woman, and if he visits her again, he is to come before the church and be subjected to the ordeal of hot iron to prove his innocence. If he is proven to have committed adultery, canon 5 decrees that \\"eviretur\\" - he should have his penis cut off - and then he should be exiled. The punishment for the adulterous woman is mutilation of the nose, a familiar Byzantine punishment, unless her husband takes pity on her, in which case they should both be exiled. Canon 6 deals with a similar situation for clerics: if a man suspects a cleric from visiting his wife, the cleric should firstly be forbidden from visiting her; a second offense should be pointed out to a church magistrate, and a third offense will result in the deordination of the cleric. He will then be subject to the same punishments described in canon 5. Canon 7 forbids a pimp or a prostitute from \\"corrupting a wife with words\\" and causing her to become an adulterer. The punishments in canon 5 apply here as well. Canons 8-11 establish punishments for sodomy, the first appearance of such punishments in medieval law. According to canon 8, an adult sodomite, \\"tam faciens quam paciens\\" (both the active and the passive parties), should be burned at the stake. If, however, the passive party is a child or an elderly person, canon 9 says that only the active party should be burned, and it will suffice that the passive party repent, as he is presumed to have sinned against his will. If the sodomy is against his will but he keeps it hidden for whatever reason, canon 10 says that he too will be judged as a sodomite. Canon 11 allows for a sodomite to repent and avoid punishment, but if he is found to have participated in sodomy a second time, he will be allowed to repent again but will be exiled from the kingdom. Canons 12-15 pertain to sexual relations with Muslims, an important question in the Kingdom, where Muslims far outnumbered their Latin overlords. Canon 12 states that a man who willingly has sexual relations with a Muslim woman should be castrated, and she should have her nose mutilated. If a man rapes his own female Muslim slave, according to canon 13 she should be confiscated by the state, and he should be castrated. If he rapes another man's female Muslim slave, canon 14 says that he should be subjected to the punishment for adulterers stated in canon 5, castration. Canon 15 deals with the same subject for Christian women - if a Christian woman willingly has sexual relations with a Muslim man, they should both be subjected to the punishment for adulterers, but if she was raped, then she will not be held accountable and the Muslim will be castrated. Canon 16 prohibits Muslims from dressing like Christians. This canon foreshadows the similar canon 68 of the Fourth Lateran Council almost one hundred years later in 1215, which would prohibit both Jews and Muslims from adopting Christian dress. Similar laws were promulgated in Spain, where Christians, Jews, and Muslims similarly intermingled. Canons 17-19 deal with bigamy, another important subject, as many crusaders had abandoned their families in Europe. If a man takes a second wife, he should do penance until the first Sunday of Lent, but if he hides his crime and is discovered, his property should be confiscated and he should be exiled. Canon 18 allows for bigamy to go unpunished if a man or woman unknowingly marries someone who is already married, as long as they can prove their ignorance. If a man has taken a second wife and wishes to divorce her, canon 19 states that he must prove that he is already married, either by the ordeal of hot iron, or by bringing witnesses to swear for him. Canons 20-21 deal with clerics. Canon 20 says a cleric should not be held guilty if he takes up arms in self-defense, but he cannot take up arms for any other reason nor can he act like a knight. This was an important concern for the Crusader states; clerics were generally forbidden from participating in warfare in European law, but the Crusaders needed all the manpower they could find, and only one year before, Antioch had been defended by the Patriarch following the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, one of the calamities referred to in the introduction to the canons. Canon 21 says that a monk or canon regular who apostatizes should either return to his order or go into exile. Canon 22 simply forbids false accusations. Canons 23-25 pertain to theft. Canon 23 says that anyone convicted of stealing property worth more than one bezant should have either a hand or foot cut off, or an eye removed. If the property was worth less than one bezant, he should be branded on the face and publicly whipped. The stolen goods should be returned, but if they are no longer in the thief's possession, the thief himself becomes the property of his victim. If the thief is caught stealing again, he should either have his other hand, foot, or eye removed, or he should be killed. If the thief was underage, canon 24 says he should be kept in custody and then sent to the royal court, but no further punishment is outlined. Canon 25 states that these punishments also do not apply to the barons, who should be subject only to the judgement of the royal court.

Its deck is 185 metres long, 20 metres wide and about 18 metres above the river's surface. The bridge was opened on 17 December 2006, and is the first bridge in Australia exclusively designed for buses, cyclists and pedestrians. The bridge cost $55.5 million to construct.Brisbane City Council. Green Bridge Starts - new infrastructure era , 27 April 2005. The opening of the bridge signalled the end of the popular cross-river ferry service between Dutton Park and St Lucia, which had been running since 1967. The two ferries that remained at the cessation of the service, MV Loyalty and MV Vicky Lynn were sold, the Loyalty now being used as a private vessel and the Vicky Lynn as a floating advertisement for the Riverpoint Luxury Apartments in West End.'Riverpoint Luxury Apartments' Construction The \\"as-built\\" concept design of the bridge was proposed as an alternative design by Bruce Ramsay. Construction of the bridge has included a new road through Dutton Park, the expansion of Annerley Road, a new bus station for the University of Queensland and the permanent redirection of College Road in St Lucia. The detailed design and the construction was carried out by John Holland Group. A related transport infrastructure project is the Eastern Busway which links the Eleanor Schonell Bridge with the Queensland Rail City network at Park Road station and to the South East Busway Public transport services To coincide with the opening, TransLink announced three new bus services which will use the bridge. These services are the 109, 169 and 209. The 109 started operation on 18 December 2006, and links UQ to the city via Annerley Road and the CBD end of the South East Busway. The 169 service began in February 2007 and links UQ with Eight Mile Plains and Garden City. The 209 service also began in February 2007, and links UQ with Carindale. The fourth service, the 139, was introduced in July 2007 in order to address overcrowding issues on the 169 and on Mains Road services from the Griffith University busway station, and links UQ with Sunnybank and Sunnybank Hills. The 139 only operates on weekdays during university semesters. The fifth service, the 192, was announced in October 2008 and is designed to connect the university to West End and Highgate Hill. The 192 is not a new service; rather it is an extension of an older route servicing the West End/Highgate Hill area. It only operates on weekdays. The most recent addition to the UQ service is the 29 route, operating a shuttle every five minutes between the Woolloongabba Bus Station and UQ Lakes.  Traffic impact  Although southside travellers previously had the option of boarding a cross-river ferry, the bridge has a far greater capacity. Average river crossing times have also improved, especially in the off-peak when only one ferry was in use. The popularity of the bridge had initially proven troubling to TransLink and the Brisbane City Council, with extra buses having to be put on to cater to the large number of commuters traveling to St. Lucia campus. The Boggo road busway is now complete, and has delivered improved efficiency for the rail/bus interface at Park Road Station and has opened up the St. Lucia area to more travelers. The new route possibilities are not all one-sided; northside commuters now have a 15-minute cycle along Annerley Road and the Goodwill bridge to the CBD from the UQ side of the bridge. St. Lucia end The traffic area at the St Lucia end of the bridge terminates as a cul- de-sac, without any non-pedestrian thoroughfare options into the streets around The University of Queensland or St Lucia. The separate path for cyclists on the bridge leads directly through to various paths away from the bridge, a deliberate measure to ensure that \\"there will be no through-running bus service connected to the campus or to the suburb of St Lucia\\". Naming Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman announced on 28 August 2006 that the Green Bridge would officially be called the Eleanor Schonell Bridge. An independent panel including Brisbane historian and author Helen Gregory, University of Queensland academic Professor Michael Keniger, Architect Bill Corker from Denton Corker Marshall and a representative from the Lord Mayor's Youth Advisory Council Milindee Jeewandara produced a short list of three names to Brisbane's Civic Cabinet from hundreds suggested by the public being: Eleanor Schonell Bridge, Hawken Bridge and University Bridge. > Eleanor Schonell made an internationally recognised contribution to testing > for dyslexia and was renowned for her generous and humane approach to life. > Her work with cerebral palsy children led to international recognition and > she also contributed substantially to the education of children with > intellectual disabilities. During its conception and construction, the bridge was known as the \\"Green Bridge\\" because it was a sustainable transport initiative and since the naming many people have continued to call it the Green Bridge in preference to its official name. Green power To conserve energy consumption energy efficient and low wattage lights were used. Feature lighting was also minimised to reduce both power requirements and the impact of the bridge on the surrounding area. Cut-off timers and remote operation features were also incorporated to reduce the amount of unnecessary lighting while still maintaining a safe environment for users. The energy requirement of the bridge is generated by a high-profile solar roof, containing 108 x 175W panels. The solar roof feeds electricity back into the supply authority grid thereby offsetting the mains power electricity used by the bridge at night. Incidents On 24 October 2009, 21-year-old University of Queensland student Whitney Heuvel urged his friends to use a camera phone to film him jumping off the bridge. Intoxicated, he misjudged the rails and fell awkwardly, resulting in his death.
