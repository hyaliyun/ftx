Long active in politics, he served briefly as a congressman from New York, and was the unsuccessful candidate of the new Liberal Republican party in the 1872 presidential election against incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant, who won by a landslide. Greeley was born to a poor family in Amherst, New Hampshire. He was apprenticed to a printer in Vermont and went to New York City in 1831 to seek his fortune. He wrote for or edited several publications and involved himself in Whig Party politics, taking a significant part in William Henry Harrison's successful 1840 presidential campaign. The following year, he founded the Tribune, which became the highest-circulating newspaper in the country through weekly editions sent by mail. Among many other issues, he urged the settlement of the American West, which he saw as a land of opportunity for the young and the unemployed. He popularized the slogan \\"Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.\\" He endlessly promoted utopian reforms such as socialism, vegetarianism, agrarianism, feminism, and temperance while hiring the best talent he could find. Greeley's alliance with William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed led to him serving three months in the House of Representatives, where he angered many by investigating Congress in his newspaper. In 1854, he helped found and may have named the Republican Party. Republican newspapers across the nation regularly reprinted his editorials. During the Civil War, he mostly supported Lincoln, though he urged the president to commit to the end of slavery before Lincoln was willing to do so. After Lincoln's assassination, he supported the Radical Republicans in opposition to President Andrew Johnson. He broke with Republican President Ulysses Grant because of corruption and Greeley's sense that Reconstruction policies were no longer needed. Greeley was the new Liberal Republican Party's presidential nominee in 1872. He lost in a landslide despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party. He was devastated by the death of his wife five days before the election and died one month later, before the Electoral College met. Early life Horace Greeley Birthplace in Amherst, New Hampshire Horace Greeley was born on February 3, 1811, on a farm about five miles from Amherst, New Hampshire. He could not breathe for the first twenty minutes of his life. It is suggested that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome‚Äîsome of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. His father's family was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, while his mother's family descended from Scots-Irish immigrants from the village of Garvagh in County Londonderry who had settled Londonderry, New Hampshire. Some of Greeley's maternal ancestors were present at the Siege of Derry during the Williamite War in Ireland in 1689. Greeley was the son of poor farmers Zaccheus and Mary (Woodburn) Greeley. Zaccheus was not successful, and moved his family several times, as far west as Pennsylvania. Horace attended the local schools and was a brilliant student. Seeing the boy's intelligence, some neighbors offered to pay Horace's way at Phillips Exeter Academy, but the Greeleys were too proud to accept charity. In 1820, Zaccheus's financial reverses caused him to flee New Hampshire with his family lest he be imprisoned for debt, and settle in Vermont. Even as his father struggled to make a living as a hired hand, Horace Greeley read everything he could‚Äîthe Greeleys had a neighbor who let Horace use his library. In 1822, Horace ran away from home to become a printer's apprentice, but was told he was too young. In 1826, at age 15, he was made a printer's apprentice to Amos Bliss, editor of the Northern Spectator, a newspaper in East Poultney, Vermont. There, he learned the mechanics of a printer's job, and acquired a reputation as the town encyclopedia, reading his way through the local library. When the paper closed in 1830, the young man went west to join his family, living near Erie, Pennsylvania. He remained there only briefly, going from town to town seeking newspaper employment, and was hired by the Erie Gazette. Although ambitious for greater things, he remained until 1831 to help support his father. While there, he became a Universalist, breaking from his Congregationalist upbringing. First efforts at publishing Early depiction of Greeley's first arrival in New York In late 1831, Greeley went to New York City to seek his fortune. There were many young printers in New York who had likewise come to the metropolis, and he could only find short-term work. In 1832, Greeley worked as an employee of the publication Spirit of the Times. He built his resources and set up a print shop in that year. In 1833, he tried his hand with Horatio D. Sheppard at editing a daily newspaper, the New York Morning Post, which was not a success. Despite this failure and its attendant financial loss, Greeley published the thrice-weekly Constitutionalist, which mostly printed lottery results. On March 22, 1834, he published the first issue of The New-Yorker in partnership with Jonas Winchester. It was less expensive than other literary magazines of the time and published both contemporary ditties and political commentary. Circulation reached 9,000, then a sizable number, yet it was ill-managed and eventually fell victim to the economic Panic of 1837. He also published the campaign newssheet of the new Whig Party in New York for the 1834 campaign, and came to believe in its positions, including free markets with government assistance in developing the nation. Soon after his move to New York City, Greeley met Mary Young Cheney. Both were living at a boarding house run on the diet principles of Sylvester Graham, eschewing meat, alcohol, coffee, tea, and spices, as well as abstaining from the use of tobacco. Greeley was subscribing to Graham's principles at the time, and to the end of his life rarely ate meat. Mary Cheney, a schoolteacher, moved to North Carolina to take a teaching job in 1835. They were married in Warrenton, North Carolina on July 5, 1836, and an announcement duly appeared in The New-Yorker eleven days later. Greeley had stopped over in Washington, D.C. on his way south to observe Congress. He took no honeymoon with his new wife, returning to work while his wife took up a teaching job in New York City. One of the positions taken by The New-Yorker was that the unemployed of the cities should seek lives in the developing American West (in the 1830s, the West encompassed today's Midwestern states). The harsh winter of 1836‚Äì1837 and the financial crisis that developed soon after made many New Yorkers homeless and destitute. In his journal, Greeley urged new immigrants to buy guide books on the West, and Congress to make public lands available for purchase at cheap rates to settlers. He told his readers, \\"Fly, scatter through the country, go to the Great West, anything rather than remain here ... the West is the true destination.\\" In 1838, he advised \\"any young man\\" about to start in the world, \\"Go to the West: there your capabilities are sure to be appreciated and your energy and industry rewarded.\\" In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed spoke for a liberal faction of the Whigs in his newspaper the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley as editor of the state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit. Greeley was deeply involved in the campaign of the Whig candidate for president in 1840, William Henry Harrison. He published the major Whig periodical the Log Cabin, and also wrote many of the pro-Harrison songs that marked the campaign. These songs were sung at mass meetings, many organized and led by Greeley. According to biographer Robert C. Williams, \\"Greeley's lyrics swept the country and roused Whig voters to action.\\" Funds raised by Weed helped distribute the Log Cabin widely. Harrison and his running mate John Tyler were easily elected. Editor of the Tribune =Early years (1841‚Äì1848)= Photograph of Greeley by Mathew Brady, taken between 1844 and 1860 By the end of the 1840 campaign, the Log Cabin's circulation had risen to 80,000 and Greeley decided to establish a daily newspaper, the New-York Tribune. At the time, New York had many newspapers, dominated by James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald, which with a circulation of about 55,000 had more readers than its combined competition. As technology advanced, it became cheaper and easier to publish a newspaper, and the daily press came to dominate the weekly, which had once been the more common format for news periodicals. Greeley borrowed money from friends to get started, and published the first issue of the Tribune on April 10, 1841 ‚Äî the day of a memorial parade in New York for President Harrison, who had died after a month in office and been replaced by Vice President Tyler. In the first issue, Greeley promised that his newspaper would be a \\"new morning Journal of Politics, Literature, and General Intelligence\\". New Yorkers were not initially receptive; the first week's receipts were $92 and expenses $525. The paper was sold for a cent a copy by newsboys who purchased bundles of papers at a discount. The price of advertising was initially four cents a line but was quickly raised to six cents. Through the 1840s, the Tribune was four pages, that is, a single sheet folded. It initially had 600 subscribers and 5,000 copies were sold of the first issue. In the early days, Greeley's chief assistant was Henry J. Raymond, who a decade later founded The New York Times. To place the Tribune on a sound financial footing, Greeley sold a half- interest in it to attorney Thomas McElrath (1807‚Äì1888), who became publisher of the Tribune (Greeley was editor) and ran the business side. Politically, the Tribune backed Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, who had unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination that fell to Harrison, and supported Clay's American System for development of the country. Greeley was one of the first newspaper editors to have a full-time correspondent in Washington, an innovation quickly followed by his rivals. Part of Greeley's strategy was to make the Tribune a newspaper of national scope, not merely local. One factor in establishing the paper nationally was the Weekly Tribune, created in September 1841 when the Log Cabin and The New-Yorker were merged. With an initial subscription price of $2 a year, this was sent to many across the United States by mail and was especially popular in the Midwest. In December 1841, Greeley was offered the editorship of the national Whig newspaper, the Madisonian. He demanded full control, and declined when not given it. Greeley, in his paper, initially supported the Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, he supported the Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition to slavery as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery. Greeley hired Margaret Fuller in 1844 as first literary editor of the Tribune, for which she wrote over 200 articles. She lived with the Greeley family for several years, and when she moved to Italy, he made her a foreign correspondent. He promoted the work of Henry David Thoreau, serving as literary agent and seeing to it that Thoreau's work was published. Ralph Waldo Emerson also benefited from Greeley's promotion. Historian Allan Nevins explained: Greeley, who had met his wife at a Graham boarding house, became enthusiastic about other social movements that did not last and promoted them in his paper. He subscribed to the views of Charles Fourier, a French social thinker, then recently deceased, who proposed the establishment of settlements called \\"phalanxes\\" with a given number of people from various walks of life, who would function as a corporation and among whose members profits would be shared. Greeley, in addition to promoting Fourierism in the Tribune, was associated with two such settlements, both of which eventually failed, though the town that eventually developed on the site of the one in Pennsylvania was after his death renamed Greeley. =Congressman (1848‚Äì1849)= In November 1848, Congressman David S. Jackson, a Democrat, of New York's 6th district was unseated for election fraud. Jackson's term was to expire in March 1849 but, during the 19th century, Congress convened annually in December, making it important to fill the seat. Under the laws then in force, the Whig committee from the Sixth District chose Greeley to run in the special election for the remainder of the term, though they did not select him as their candidate for the seat in the following Congress. The Sixth District, or Sixth Ward as it was commonly called, was mostly Irish-American, and Greeley proclaimed his support for Irish efforts towards independence from the United Kingdom. He easily won the November election and took his seat when Congress convened in December 1848. Greeley's selection was procured by the influence of his ally, Thurlow Weed. As a congressman for three months, Greeley introduced legislation for a homestead act that would allow settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates‚Äîa fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This was enough to make him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848, the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported a bill that would have corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had \\"divided the House into two parties‚Äîone that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it.\\" Other legislation introduced by Greeley, all of which failed, included attempts to end flogging in the Navy and to ban alcohol from its ships. He tried to change the name of the United States to \\"Columbia\\", abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and increase tariffs. One lasting effect of the term of Congressman Greeley was his friendship with a fellow Whig, serving his only term in the House, Illinois's Abraham Lincoln. Greeley's term ended after March 3, 1849, and he returned to New York and the Tribune, having, according to Williams, \\"failed to achieve much except notoriety\\". =Influence (1849‚Äì1860)= New-York Tribune editorial staff, with Greeley third from the left in the front row By the end of the 1840s, Greeley's Tribune was not only solidly established in New York as a daily paper, it was highly influential nationally through its weekly edition, which circulated in rural areas and small towns. Journalist Bayard Taylor deemed its influence in the Midwest second only to that of the Bible. According to Williams, the Tribune could mold public opinion through Greeley's editorials more effectively than could the president. Greeley sharpened those skills over time, laying down what future Secretary of State John Hay, who worked for the Tribune in the 1870s, deemed the \\"Gospel according to St. Horace\\". The Tribune remained a Whig paper, but Greeley took an independent course. In 1848, he had been slow to endorse the Whig presidential nominee, General Zachary Taylor, a Louisianan and hero of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Greeley opposed both the war and the expansion of slavery into the new territories seized from Mexico and feared Taylor would support expansion as president. Greeley considered endorsing former President Martin Van Buren, candidate of the Free Soil Party, but finally endorsed Taylor, who was elected; the editor was rewarded for his loyalty with the congressional term. Greeley vacillated on support for the Compromise of 1850, which gave victories to both sides of the slavery issue, before finally opposing it. In the 1852 presidential campaign, he supported the Whig candidate, General Winfield Scott, but savaged the Whig platform for its support of the Compromise. \\"We defy it, execrate it, spit upon it.\\" Such party divisions contributed to Scott's defeat by former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce. In 1853, with the party increasingly divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not sorry to see him go: the Republic, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: \\"If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions.\\" When, in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to decide whether it would be slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the Tribune as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the Tribune reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the Civil War. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act helped destroy the Whig Party, but a new party with opposition to the spread of slavery at its heart had been under discussion for some years. Beginning in 1853, Greeley participated in the discussions that led to the founding of the Republican Party and may have coined its name. Greeley attended the first New York state Republican Convention in 1854 and was disappointed not to be nominated either for governor or lieutenant governor. The switch in parties coincided with the end of two of his longtime political alliances: in December 1854, Greeley wrote that the political partnership between Weed, William Seward (who was by then senator after serving as governor) and himself was ended \\"by the withdrawal of the junior partner\\". Greeley was angered over patronage disputes and felt that Seward was courting the rival The New York Times for support. In 1853, Greeley purchased a farm in rural Chappaqua, New York, where he experimented with farming techniques. In 1856, he designed and built Rehoboth, one of the first concrete structures in the United States. The Tribune continued to print a wide variety of material. In 1851, its managing editor, Charles Dana, recruited Karl Marx as a foreign correspondent in London. Marx collaborated with Friedrich Engels on his work for the Tribune, which continued for over a decade, covering 500 articles. Greeley felt compelled to print, \\"Mr. Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far from agreeing, but those who do not read his letters are neglecting one of the most instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European politics.\\" Greeley sponsored a host of reforms, including pacifism and feminism and especially the ideal of the hard-working free laborer. Greeley demanded reforms to make all citizens free and equal. He envisioned virtuous citizens who would eradicate corruption. He talked endlessly about progress, improvement, and freedom, while calling for harmony between labor and capital.Mitchell Snay, Horace Greeley and the Politics of Reform in Nineteenth-Century America (2011). Greeley's editorials promoted social democratic reforms and were widely reprinted. They influenced the free- labor ideology of the Whigs and the radical wing of the Republican Party, especially in promoting the free-labor ideology. Before 1848 he sponsored an American version of Fourierist socialist reform. but backed away after the failed revolutions of 1848 in Europe.Adam-Max Tuchinsky, \\"'The Bourgeoisie Will Fall and Fall Forever': The New-York Tribune, the 1848 French Revolution, and American Social Democratic Discourse.\\" Journal of American History 92.2 (2005): 470-497. To promote multiple reforms Greeley hired a roster of writers who later became famous in their own right, including Margaret Fuller,Adam-Max Tuchinsky, \\"'Her Cause Against Herself': Margaret Fuller, Emersonian Democracy, and the Nineteenth-Century Public Intellectual.\\" American Nineteenth Century History 5.1 (2004): 66-99. Charles Anderson Dana, George William Curtis, William Henry Fry, Bayard Taylor, Julius Chambers and Henry Jarvis Raymond, who later co-founded The New York Times. For many years George Ripley was the staff literary critic.Charles Crowe, George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist (1967) Jane Swisshelm was one of the first women hired by a major newspaper.Kathleen Endres, \\"Jane Grey Swisshelm: 19th century journalist and feminist.\\" Journalism History 2.4 (1975): 128. In 1859, Greeley traveled across the continent to see the West for himself, to write about it for the Tribune, and to publicize the need for a transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. In May 1859, he went to Chicago, and then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Nevertheless, after speaking before the first ever Kansas Republican Party Convention at Osawatomie, Kansas, Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader Brigham Young ‚Äì the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans and was sympathetic but, like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he toured widely and gave many addresses. =1860 presidential election= Although he remained on cordial terms with Senator Seward, Greeley never seriously considered supporting him in his bid for the Republican nomination for president. Instead, during the run-up to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he pressed the candidacy of former Missouri representative Edward Bates, an opponent of the spread of slavery who had freed his own slaves. In his newspaper, in speeches, and in conversation, Greeley pushed Bates as a man who could win the North and even make inroads in the South. Nevertheless, when one of the dark horse candidates for the Republican nomination, Abraham Lincoln, came to New York to give an address at Cooper Union, Greeley urged his readers to go hear Lincoln, and was among those who accompanied him to the platform. Greeley thought of Lincoln as a possible nominee for vice president. Greeley attended the convention as a substitute for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln‚Äîhe had little success gaining delegates for Bates. On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, \\"it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did\\". Seward's forces made Greeley a target of their anger at the senator's defeat. One subscriber cancelled, regretting the three-cent stamp he had to use on the letter; Greeley supplied a replacement. When he was attacked in print, Greeley responded in kind. He launched a campaign against corruption in the New York Legislature, hoping voters would defeat incumbents and the new legislators would elect him to the Senate when Seward's term expired in 1861 (senators were until 1913 elected by state legislatures). But his main activity during the campaign of 1860 was boosting Lincoln and denigrating the other presidential candidates. He made it clear that a Republican administration would not interfere with slavery where it already was and denied that Lincoln was in favor of voting rights for African Americans. He kept up the pressure until Lincoln was elected in November. Lincoln soon let it be known that Seward would be Secretary of State, meaning he would not be a candidate for re-election to the Senate. Weed wanted William M. Evarts elected in his place, while the anti-Seward forces in New York gathered around Greeley. The crucial battleground was the Republican caucus, as the party held the majority in the legislature. Greeley's forces did not have enough votes to send him to the Senate, but they had enough strength to block Evarts's candidacy. Weed threw his support to Ira Harris, who had already received several votes, and who was chosen by the caucus and elected by the legislature in February 1861. Weed was content to have blocked the editor, and stated that he had \\"paid the first installment on a large debt to Mr. Greeley\\". =Civil War= War breaks out After Lincoln's election, there was talk of secession in the South. The Tribune was initially in favor of peaceful separation, with the South becoming a separate nation. According to an editorial on November 9: Similar editorials appeared through January 1861, after which Tribune editorials took a hard line on the South, opposing concessions. Williams concludes that \\"for a brief moment, Horace Greeley had believed that peaceful secession might be a form of freedom preferable to civil war\\". This brief flirtation with disunion would have consequences for Greeley‚Äîit was used against him by his opponents when he ran for president in 1872. In the days leading up to Lincoln's inauguration, the Tribune headed its editorial columns each day, in large capital letters: \\"No compromise!/No concession to traitors!/The Constitution as it is!\\" Greeley attended the inauguration, sitting close to Senator Douglas, as the Tribune hailed the beginning of Lincoln's presidency. When southern forces attacked Fort Sumter, the Tribune regretted the loss of the fort, but applauded the fact that war to subdue the rebels, who formed the Confederate States of America, would now take place. The paper criticized Lincoln for not being quick to use force. Through the spring and early summer of 1861, Greeley and the Tribune beat the drum for a Union attack. \\"On to Richmond\\", a phrase coined by a Tribune stringer, became the watchword of the newspaper as Greeley urged the occupation of the rebel capital of Richmond before the Confederate Congress could meet on July 20. In part because of the public pressure, Lincoln sent the half-trained Union Army into the field at the First Battle of Manassas in mid-July where it was soundly beaten. The defeat threw Greeley into despair, and he may have suffered a nervous breakdown. \\"Prayer of Twenty Millions\\" Restored to health by two weeks at the farm he had purchased in Chappaqua, Greeley returned to the Tribune and a policy of general backing of the Lincoln administration, even having kind words to say about Secretary Seward, his old foe. He was supportive even during the military defeats of the first year of the war. Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the Tribune. Lincoln eagerly accepted, \\"having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men.\\" By early 1862, however, Greeley was again sometimes critical of the administration, frustrated by the failure to win decisive military victories, and perturbed at the president's slowness to commit to the emancipation of the slaves once the Confederacy was defeated, something the Tribune was urging in its editorials. This was a change in Greeley's thinking which began after First Manassas, a shift from preservation of the Union being the primary war purpose to wanting the war to end slavery. By March, the only action against slavery that Lincoln had backed was a proposal for compensated emancipation in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union, though he signed legislation abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. Lincoln supposedly asked a Tribune correspondent, \\"What in the world is the matter with Uncle Horace? Why can't he restrain himself and wait a little while?\\" Greeley's prodding of Lincoln culminated in a letter to him on August 19, 1862, reprinted on the following day in the Tribune as the \\"Prayer of Twenty Millions\\". By this time, Lincoln had informed his Cabinet of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation he had composed, and Greeley was told of it the same day the prayer was printed. In his letter, Greeley demanded action on emancipation and strict enforcement of the Confiscation Acts. Lincoln must \\"fight slavery with liberty\\", and not fight \\"wolves with the devices of a sheep\\". Lincoln's reply would become famous, much more so than the prayer that provoked it. \\"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.\\" Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem \\"that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom.\\" Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, \\"but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation\\". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a \\"great boon of freedom\\". According to Williams, \\"Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation.\\" Draft riots and peace efforts honored on a 1961 U.S. postage stamp After the Union victory at Gettysburg in early July 1863, the Tribune wrote that the rebellion would be quickly \\"stamped out\\". A week after the battle, the New York City draft riots erupted. Greeley and the Tribune were generally supportive of conscription, though feeling that the rich should not be allowed to evade it by hiring substitutes. Support for the draft made them targets of the mob, and the Tribune Building was surrounded, and at least once invaded. Greeley secured arms from the Brooklyn Navy Yard and 150 soldiers kept the building secure. Mary Greeley and her children were at the farm in Chappaqua; a mob threatened them, but dispersed without doing harm. In August 1863, Greeley was requested by a firm of Hartford publishers to write a history of the war. Greeley agreed, and over the next eight months penned a 600-page volume, which would be the first of two, entitled The American Conflict. The books were very successful, selling a total of 225,000 copies by 1870, a large sale for the time. Throughout the war, Greeley played with ideas as to how to settle it. In 1862, Greeley had approached the French minister to Washington, Henri Mercier, to discuss a mediated settlement. However, Seward rejected such talks and the prospect of European intervention receded after the bloody Union victory at Antietam in September 1862. In July 1864, Greeley received word that there were Confederate commissioners in Canada, empowered to offer peace. In fact, the men were in Niagara Falls, Canada to aid Peace Democrats and otherwise undermine the Union war effort. but they played along when Greeley journeyed to Niagara Falls, at Lincoln's request: the president was willing to consider any deal that included reunion and emancipation. The Confederates had no credentials and were unwilling to accompany Greeley to Washington under safe conduct. Greeley returned to New York, and the episode, when it became public, embarrassed the administration. Lincoln said nothing publicly concerning Greeley's credulous conduct, but privately indicated that he had no confidence in him anymore. Greeley did not initially support Lincoln for nomination in 1864, casting about for other candidates. In February, he wrote in the Tribune that Lincoln could not be elected to a second term. Nevertheless, no candidate made a serious challenge to Lincoln, who was nominated in June, which the Tribune applauded slightly. In August, fearing a Democratic victory and acceptance of the Confederacy, Greeley engaged in a plot to get a new convention to nominate another candidate, with Lincoln withdrawing. The plot came to nothing. Once Atlanta was taken by Union forces on September 3, Greeley became a fervent supporter of Lincoln. Greeley was gratified both by Lincoln's re-election and continued Union victories. =Reconstruction= As the war drew to a close in April 1865, Greeley and the Tribune urged magnanimity towards the defeated Confederates, arguing that making martyrs of Confederate leaders would only inspire future rebels. This talk of moderation ceased when Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Many concluded that Lincoln had fallen as the result of a final rebel plot, and the new president, Andrew Johnson, offered $100,000 for the capture of fugitive Confederate president Jefferson Davis. After the rebel leader was caught, Greeley initially advocated that \\"punishment be meted out in accord with a just verdict\\". Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who was being held at Fortress Monroe, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis's wife Varina urged Greeley to use his influence to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley was among those who signed the bail bond, and the two men met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the Tribune (especially the Weekly Tribune) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election. Initially supportive of Andrew Johnson's lenient Reconstruction policies, Greeley soon became disillusioned, as the president's plan allowed the quick formation of state governments without securing suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened in December 1865, and gradually took control of Reconstruction, he was generally supportive, as Radical Republicans pushed hard for universal male suffrage and civil rights for freedmen. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866 but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, losing to Roscoe Conkling. As president and Congress battled, Greeley remained firmly opposed to the president, and when Johnson was impeached in March 1868, Greeley and the Tribune strongly supported his removal, attacking Johnson as \\"an aching tooth in the national jaw, a screeching infant in a crowded lecture room,\\" and declaring, \\"There can be no peace or comfort till he is out.\\" Nevertheless, the president was acquitted by the Senate, much to Greeley's disappointment. Also in 1868, Greeley sought the Republican nomination for governor but was frustrated by the Conkling forces. Greeley supported the successful Republican presidential nominee, General Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 election. =Grant years= Greeley at his Chappaqua farm in 1869, photographed by his friend George G. Rockwood In 1868, Whitelaw Reid joined the Tribune 's staff as managing editor. In Reid, Greeley found a reliable second-in-command. Also on the Tribune's staff in the late 1860s was Mark Twain; Henry George sometimes contributed pieces, as did Bret Harte. In 1870, John Hay joined the staff as an editorial writer. Greeley soon pronounced Hay the most brilliant at that craft ever to write for the Tribune. Greeley maintained his interest in associationism. Beginning in 1869, he was heavily involved in an attempt to found a utopia, called the Union Colony of Colorado, on the prairie in a scheme led by Nathan Meeker. The new town of Greeley, Colorado Territory was named after him. He served as treasurer and lent Meeker money to keep the colony afloat. In 1871, Greeley published a book What I Know About Farming, based on his childhood experience and that from his country home in Chappaqua. Greeley continued to seek political office, running for state comptroller in 1869 and the House of Representatives in 1870, losing both times. In 1870, President Grant offered Greeley the post of minister to Santo Domingo (today, the Dominican Republic), which he declined. Presidential candidate As had been the case for much of the 19th century, political parties continued to be formed and to vanish after the Civil War. In September 1871, Missouri Senator Carl Schurz formed the Liberal Republican Party, founded on opposition to President Grant, opposition to corruption, and support of civil service reform, lower taxes, and land reform. He gathered around him an eclectic group of supporters whose only real link was their opposition to Grant, whose administration had proved increasingly corrupt. The party needed a candidate, with a presidential election upcoming. Greeley was one of the best-known Americans, as well as being a perennial candidate for office. He was more minded to consider a run for the Republican nomination, fearing the effect on the Tribune should he bolt the party. Nevertheless, he wanted to be president, as a Republican if possible, if not, as a Liberal Republican. The Liberal Republican national convention met in Cincinnati in May 1872. Greeley was spoken of as a possible candidate, as was Missouri Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown. Schurz was ineligible as foreign-born. On the first ballot, Supreme Court Justice David Davis led, but Greeley took a narrow lead on the second ballot. Former minister to Britain Charles Francis Adams took the lead, but on the sixth ballot, after a \\"spontaneous\\" demonstration staged by Reid, Greeley gained the nomination, with Brown as vice presidential candidate. Thomas Nast cartoon for the 1872 campaign, alleging that Greeley was contradicting his earlier positions The Democrats, when they met in Baltimore in July, faced a stark choice: nominate Greeley, long a thorn in their side, or split the anti- Grant vote and go on to certain defeat. They chose the former, and even adopted the Liberal Republican platform, which called for equal rights for African Americans. Greeley resigned as editor of the Tribune for the campaign, and, unusually for the time, embarked on a speaking tour to bring his message to the people. As it was customary for candidates for major office to not actively campaign, he was attacked as a seeker after office. Nevertheless, in late July, Greeley (and others, such as former Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes) thought he would very likely be elected. Greeley campaigned on a platform of intersectional reconciliation, arguing that the war was over and the issue of slavery was resolved. It was time to restore normality and end the continuing military occupation of the South. The Republican counterattack was well-financed, accusing Greeley of support for everything from treason to the Ku Klux Klan. The anti-Greeley campaign was famously and effectively summed up in the cartoons of Thomas Nast, whom Grant later credited with a major role in his re-election. Nast's cartoons showed Greeley giving bail money for Jefferson Davis, throwing mud on Grant, and shaking hands with John Wilkes Booth across Lincoln's grave. The Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal‚Äîcorruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad‚Äîbroke in September, but Greeley was unable to take advantage of the Grant administration's ties to the scandal as he had stock in the railroad himself, and some alleged it had been given to him in exchange for favorable coverage. Greeley's wife Mary had returned ill from a trip to Europe in late June. Her condition worsened in October, and he effectively broke off campaigning after October 12 to be with her. She died on October 30, plunging him into despair a week before the election. Poor results for the Democrats in those states that had elections for other offices in September and October presaged defeat for Greeley, and so it proved. He received 2,834,125 votes to 3,597,132 for Grant, who secured 286 electors to 66 chosen for Greeley. The editor-turned-candidate won only six states (out of 37): Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. =Final month and death= Greeley resumed the editorship of the Tribune, but quickly learned there was a movement underway to unseat him. He found himself unable to sleep, and after a final visit to the Tribune on November 13 (a week after the election) remained under medical care. At the recommendation of a family physician, Greeley was sent to Choate House, the asylum of Dr. George Choate at Pleasantville, New York. There, he continued to worsen, and died on November 29, with his two surviving daughters and Whitelaw Reid at his side. His death came before the Electoral College balloted. His 66 electoral votes were divided among four others, principally Indiana governor-elect Thomas A. Hendricks and Greeley's vice presidential running mate, Benjamin Gratz Brown. Although Greeley had requested a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair at the Church of the Divine Paternity, later the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York, where Greeley was a member. He is buried in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. Among the mourners were old friends, Tribune employees including Reid and Hay, his journalistic rivals, and a broad array of politicians, led by President Grant. Appraisal Monument to Horace Greeley in Green-Wood Cemetery Despite the venom that had been spewed over him in the presidential campaign, Greeley's death was widely mourned. Harper's Weekly, which had printed Nast's cartoons, wrote, \\"Since the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, the death of no American has been so sincerely deplored as that of Horace Greeley; and its tragical circumstances have given a peculiarly affectionate pathos to all that has been said of him.\\" Henry Ward Beecher wrote in the Christian Union, \\"when Horace Greeley died, unjust and hard judgment of him died also\\". Harriett Beecher Stowe noted Greeley's eccentric dress, \\"That poor white hat! If, alas, it covered many weaknesses, it covered also much strength, much real kindness and benevolence, and much that the world will be better for\\". Greeley supported liberal policies towards the fast-growing western regions; he memorably advised the ambitious to \\"Go West, young man.\\"Earle D.

He supported vegetarianism, opposed liquor and paid serious attention to any ism anyone proposed.Karen Iacobbo and Michael Iacobbo, Vegetarian America: A History (2004), p. 84. Historian Iver Bernstein says: Greeley's view of freedom was based in the desire that all should have the opportunity to better themselves. According to his biographer, Erik S. Lunde, \\"a dedicated social reformer deeply sympathetic to the treatment of poor white males, slaves, free blacks, and white women, he still espoused the virtues of self-help and free enterprise\\". Van Deusen stated: \\"His genuine human sympathies, his moral fervor, even the exhibitionism that was a part of his makeup, made it inevitable that he should crusade for a better world. He did so with apostolic zeal.\\" Nevertheless, Greeley's effectiveness as a reformer was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he \\"must have looked like an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat that made him look like a farmer who came into town for supplies\\". Van Deusen wrote, \\"Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap.\\" The Tribune remained under that name until 1924, when it merged with the New York Herald to become the New York Herald-Tribune, which was published until 1966. The name survived until 2013, when the International Herald-Tribune became the International New York Times. There is a statue of Greeley in City Hall Park in New York, donated by the Tribune Association. Cast in 1890, it was not dedicated until 1916. A second statue of Greeley is located in Greeley Square in Midtown Manhattan. Greeley Square, at Broadway and 33rd Street, was named by the New York City Common Council in a vote after Greeley's death.

Early life and education Born in London, de Monchaux earned her BA at the Camberwell School of Art (1980‚Äì1983) and an MA at Goldsmiths College, University of London (1985‚Äì1987). Style and career Her sculptures use materials such as glass, paper, metal, fur and leather. Her works juxtapose seductive, soft elements, sometimes associated with strongly sexual overtones, with harder materials, often spikey or in some way appearing to constrain the softer parts, resulting in work which is both sensual and threatening. Her 1997 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in particular made reference to organic forms (crustacea, fossils), animals, erotic and fetishistic imagery, turn of the century decorative traditions, architectural detailing and saintly relics.Pennina Barnett, \\"Materiality,Subjectivity & Abjection in the Work of Chohreh Feyzdjou, Nina Saunders and Cathy de Monchaux\\", n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online, 7, July 1998, pp.4-11 ISSN 1462-0426 She won a Steinberger Group Award in 1988 and the London Arts Individual Artist's Award in 1989. De Monchaux's work from the early 1990s was often characterised by the combination of red velvet and steel in simple and strong constructions, but later works have tended to move towards lighter colours and a more ornamental approach. De Monchaux was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1998. She currently lives in London and is a part-time teacher at the Slade School of Art. However, she has exhibited in the United States almost as much as, if not more than, she has in England. In her recent work, such as The Raft (2016) and State Secrets (2014), de Monchaux has concentrated more on subjects such as battles, unicorns and imagery confusing fauna, mineral and flora. In Sweetly the Air Flew Overhead, Battle with Unicorns (2007-8), the work shows small soft sculptures of riders on unicorns entangled in string, cloth and tree figures. It is reminiscent of Uccello's Battle of San Romano series where distinct horses, lances and knights celebrate human control and clarity, not least in the painter's obsessive use of perspective. By contrast, de Monchaux depicts a battle with spike-helmet knights riding unicorns that struggle in a chaos of things: to be in a battle is to be inside a mess. De Monchaux herself has mentioned recognising an unconscious allusion here to the Iraq War.

Spawned by earlier band The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, \\"Electricity\\", in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song \\"Enola Gay\\". The band achieved broader recognition via their album Architecture & Morality (1981) and its three singles, all of which were international hits. Although retrospectively acclaimed, the experimental Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European support. The band embraced a more straightforward pop sound on Junk Culture (1984), while continuing to experiment via newly acquired digital samplers; this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and yielded the 1986 hit, \\"If You Leave\\". A year after the release of The Best of OMD (1988), creative differences rendered McCluskey the only remaining member of the group as Humphreys formed spin-off band The Listening Pool. OMD would return with a new line-up and explore the dance-pop genre: Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits. By the mid-1990s, however, electronic music had been supplanted by alternative rock, and both OMD and The Listening Pool disbanded in 1996. McCluskey later conceived pop girl group Atomic Kitten, for whom he served as a principal songwriter, while Humphreys performed as half of the duo Onetwo. In 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys back in the fold and began to work on material more akin to their early output. The band re- established themselves as a chart act, and kept on touring extensively. They have sold over 40 million records to date. Roots and early years (1975‚Äì1978) Founders Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys met at primary school in Meols in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s, as teenagers, they were involved in different local groups but shared a distaste for guitar-driven rock with a macho attitude popular among their friends at the time.Taylor, Paul. Popular Music Since 1955. Mansell Pub., 1985. , By 1975 McCluskey had formed Equinox, as bassist and vocalist, alongside schoolmate Malcolm Holmes on drums, while Humphreys was their roadie. During that time McCluskey and Humphreys discovered their electronic style, influenced by Kraftwerk. After Equinox, McCluskey joined Pegasus, and, later, the short-lived Hitlerz Underpantz, alongside Humphreys. McCluskey would usually sing and play bass guitar; roadie and electronics enthusiast Humphreys graduated to keyboards. The pair shared a love of electronic music, particularly Brian Eno and Kraftwerk. In September 1977,Pete Frame's Rock Family Tree McCluskey and Humphreys put together the seven-piece (three singers, two guitarists, bassist, drummer, and keyboard player) Wirral group The Id, whose line-up included drummer Malcolm Holmes and McCluskey's girlfriend Julia Kneale on vocals. The group began to gig regularly in the Merseyside area, performing original material (largely written by McCluskey and Humphreys). They had quite a following on the scene, and one of their tracks (\\"Julia's Song\\") was included on a compilation record of local bands called Street to Street. Meanwhile, Humphreys and McCluskey collaborated on a side-project called VCL XI (named after a misreading of a valve from the diagram on the back cover of Kraftwerk's Radio-Activity album; the name of valve is actually written with Arabic numbers, VCL 11, and not Roman numerals). This side-project allowed them to pursue their more bizarre electronic experiments, often working with tape collages, home-made kit-built synthesisers, and circuit-bent radios. In August 1978, The Id split due to musical differences. The same month, McCluskey joined Wirral electronic outfit Dalek I Love You as their lead singer, but quit in September. Formation and first releases (1978‚Äì1979) In September 1978, the same month he left Dalek I Love You, McCluskey rejoined Humphreys and their VCL XI project was renamed Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The name was gleaned from a list of song lyrics and ideas that were written on McCluskey's bedroom wall; the name was chosen so as not to be mistaken for a punk band.Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed, Dave Wilson, 2004, p. 58 OMD began to gig regularly as a duo, performing to backing tracks played from a TEAC 4-track tape-recorder christened \\"Winston\\" (after the antihero of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four). Their debut performance was in October 1978 at Eric's Club in Liverpool. Finding themselves on the cusp of an electronic new wave in British pop-music, they released a one-off single, \\"Electricity\\", with independent label Factory Records. The track was supposed to be produced by the Factory Records producer Martin Hannett. However, the A-side was the band's original demo produced by their friend, owner of Winston and soon to be manager, Paul Collister under the pseudonym Chester Valentino (taken from a nightclub called Valentino's in the nearby city of Chester). The single's sleeve was designed by Peter Saville, whose distinctive graphics provided OMD's public image well into the mid-1980s. In 1979 they were asked to support Gary Numan on his first major British tour. Humphreys noted, \\"[Numan] gave us our first big break. He saw us opening for Joy Division and he asked us to go on tour with him... we went from the small clubs to playing huge arenas. Gary was very good to us.\\" Numan later supported OMD on a 1993 arena tour. Classic line-up (1980‚Äì1988) The eponymous first album (1980) showcased the band's live set at the time, and was basically the Humphreys/McCluskey duo, although it included some guest drums from Id drummer Malcolm Holmes and saxophone from Wirral musician Martin Cooper. It had a raw, poppy, melodic synth-pop sound. Dindisc arranged for the song \\"Messages\\" to be re-recorded (produced by Gong bassist Mike Howlett) and released as a single ‚Äì it gave the band their first hit. Dave Hughes, a founder member of Dalek I Love You who joined OMD in early 1980, is featured in the \\"Messages\\" video. A tour followed, Winston the tape recorder was augmented with live drums from Malcolm Holmes, and Dalek I Love You's Dave Hughes on synths. Hughes then left OMD in November 1980, replaced by Martin Cooper. The second album Organisation (a reference to the band which preceded Kraftwerk, founded by Kraftwerk's original members Florian Schneider- Esleben and Ralf H√ºtter) followed later that year, recorded as a three-piece with Humphreys, McCluskey and Holmes. It was again produced by Howlett, and had a rather moodier, dark feel. The album included the hit single \\"Enola Gay\\", named after the plane that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The song was intended to be included on the debut album, but was left out at the final selection. The tour for this album had a 4-piece band line-up, with saxophonist Martin Cooper (another Dalek I Love You alumnus) recruited for keyboard duties. In early 1981, Record Mirror named OMD as the fourth-best band of 1980; NME and Sounds both named the group as one of the 10 best new acts of that year.West, p. 26 Howlett then presided over the recording of a further hit single, \\"Souvenir\\", co-written by Cooper & Humphreys. It ushered in a lush choral electronic sound. The song also became OMD's biggest UK hit to date. In November 1981, their most commercially successful album was released in the UK and Europe ‚Äì Architecture & Morality. The group went into the studio with Richard Mainwaring producing. Cooper then temporarily dropped out and was replaced by Mike Douglas, but this change was reversed by the time the album was released and a tour followed. The album's sound saw OMD's original synth-pop sound augmented by the Mellotron, an instrument previously associated with prog rock bands. They used it to add very atmospheric swatches of string, choir, and other sounds to their palette. Two more hit singles \\"Joan of Arc\\" and \\"Maid of Orleans\\" (which became the biggest-selling single of 1982 in Germany) were on the album. \\"Joan of Arc\\" and \\"Maid of Orleans\\" were originally both titled \\"Joan of Arc\\"; the name of the latter single was changed at the insistence of the publishers and to avoid confusion. It became \\"Joan of Arc (Maid of Orleans)\\" and later simply \\"Maid of Orleans\\". In 1983 the band lost commercial momentum somewhat, with the release of their more experimental Dazzle Ships album, which mixed melancholy synth ballads and uptempo synth-pop with musique concr√®te and short wave radio tape collages. It was recorded by the 4-piece Humphreys/Holmes/Cooper/McCluskey line-up, and produced by Rhett Davies. Its relative commercial failure caused a crisis of confidence for Humphreys and McCluskey and brought about a deliberate move towards the mainstream. =Pop-oriented recordings (1984‚Äì1988)= 1984's Junk Culture was a shift to a more pop-style sound and the band used digital sampling keyboards such as the Fairlight CMI and the E-mu Emulator. The album was a success, reassuring the group about their new direction. The \\"Locomotion\\" single returned the group to the top five in the UK and was a good indicator of the group's new found sound, notably the adoption of a classic verse‚Äìchorus form, which is something the group had often previously avoided. In 1985, the band expanded to a sextet, featuring new band members Graham Weir (guitar, keyboards, trombone) and Neil Weir (trumpet, bass guitar), and released Crush, produced by Stephen Hague in Paris and New York. The success of the single \\"So in Love\\" in the US Billboard Hot 100 also led to some success for the LP which entered the American Top 40, establishing the group in the US and making Stephen Hague a sought-after producer. During this period, the band also recorded a special version of \\"So in Love\\" in duet with the French pop singer Etienne Daho. Later in 1985 the band was asked to write a song for the John Hughes film Pretty in Pink. They selected \\"Goddess of Love\\". The ending of the film was re shot. After the song received a negative reaction from test groups, OMD wrote \\"If You Leave\\" in less than 24 hours and it became a top 5 hit in the US, Canada, and New Zealand in 1986. At the end of this year, the same six piece line-up also released The Pacific Age, but the band began to see their critical and public popularity wane notably in the UK. The album's first single, \\"(Forever) Live and Die\\", was a top 10 hit across Europe and entered the top 20 in both the UK and US. Journalist Hugo Lindgren argued that the success of \\"If You Leave\\" has concealed from US audiences the group's history of making innovative music. Split and McCluskey-led OMD (1989‚Äì1996) During 1988 the band appeared poised to consolidate their US success, with a support slot for Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses Tour at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on 18 June 1988, a top 20 US hit with \\"Dreaming\\" and a successful \\"Best of\\" album. However, it was at this point when OMD broke in two. Graham and Neil Weir left at the end of the 1988 US tour and co-founder Paul Humphreys subsequently called it a day, unhappy with the band's commercial orientation. Finally, Cooper and Holmes left OMD to join Humphreys in founding a new band called the Listening Pool in 1989. It left only McCluskey to carry on, essentially becoming a solo artist working under the OMD banner. McCluskey's first album from the new OMD was the dance-pop Sugar Tax album in May 1991, which charted at No. 3 in the UK. McCluskey recruited in 1989 Liverpool musicians Raw Unlimited (Lloyd Massett, Stuart Kershaw, Nathalie Loates) as collaborators for the making of Sugar Tax: writing credits carefully distinguished between songs written by OMD (i.e., McCluskey) and songs written by OMD/Kershaw/Massett. This iteration of the group was initially successful with hits like \\"Sailing on the Seven Seas\\" and \\"Pandora's Box\\", with lesser success on fellow chart entries, \\"Call My Name\\" and \\"Then You Turn Away\\". McCluskey's live band was then formed by Nigel Ipinson (keyboards), Phil Coxon (keyboards), and Abe Juckes (drums) since late 1990. Kershaw, Ipinson, and Coxon from 1992 to 1996 contributed to OMD albums and a 1993 tour. The album Liberator was released in 1993. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart. Lead single \\"Stand Above Me\\" peaked at no. 21 on the UK Singles Chart, with follow-up \\"Dream of Me\\" charting at no. 24. Paul Humphreys, while no longer part of the group, co-wrote the single \\"Everyday\\" (a No. 59 UK chart entry). The fifth track from Liberator, \\"Dream of Me\\", was built around a sample from \\"Love's Theme\\" by Love Unlimited Orchestra, a track which was written and produced by Barry White. To release the \\"Dream of Me\\" track as an OMD single, however, McCluskey had to agree that the single release of the track would remove the actual \\"Love's Theme\\" sample, but still be officially titled \\"Dream of Me (Based on Love's Theme)\\", and furthermore would still give a writing credit to White. Also in 1993, McCluskey made contributions to the Esperanto album, a project by former Kraftwerk member Karl Bartos (then working under the moniker of Elektric Music). McCluskey returned with a rotating cast of musicians for the 1996 album Universal, which featured two songs co-written by Humphreys as well as a holdover from the Esperanto sessions, co-penned by Bartos. The record spawned OMD's first Top 20 hit in five years, \\"Walking on the Milky Way\\". Disbandment (1996) Though both Liberator and Universal produced minor hits, McCluskey retired the OMD name in late 1996, due to waning public interest. A second singles album was released in 1998, along with an EP of remixed material by such acts as Sash! and Moby. Post-1996, McCluskey decided to focus on songwriting for such Liverpool based acts as Atomic Kitten and the Genie Queen, and trying to develop new Merseyside artists from his Motor Museum recording studio. With McCluskey focusing his talents elsewhere, Humphreys decided to work with his new musical partner Claudia Br√ºcken, of the ZTT bands Propaganda and Act, as Onetwo. He also undertook a US live tour under the banner Paul Humphreys from OMD. Reformation (2006‚Äìpresent) An unexpected request to perform from a German Television show and McCluskey's divorce led the group to reform. On 1 January 2006, Andy McCluskey announced plans to reform OMD with the McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes, and Cooper line-up. The original plan was to tour the album Architecture & Morality and other pre-1983 material, then record a new album set for release in 2007. In May 2007, the Architecture & Morality remastered CD was re-released together with a DVD featuring the Drury Lane concert from 1981 that had previously been available on VHS. Through May and June, the band toured with the \\"classic\\" line up of McCluskey, Humphreys, Holmes and Cooper. They began their set with a re-ordered but otherwise complete re-staging of the Architecture & Morality album. The second half of each concert featured a selection of their best known hits. In Spring 2008, a live CD and DVD of the 2007 tour, OMD Live: Architecture & Morality & More, recorded at the London Hammersmith Apollo, was released as was a 25th anniversary re-release of Dazzle Ships, including six bonus tracks. At the same time, a brief October 2008 tour was announced, partly to tie-in with the Dazzle Ships album's 25th anniversary. China Crisis supported OMD on this tour. In June 2009, an orchestral concert with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was given in Liverpool. A recording of this concert was released on DVD in December. In November and December, the band returned to arena touring as support for Simple Minds. OMD had performed with Night of the Proms in December 2006 in Germany and renewed the experience again in Belgium and the Netherlands that year. They were the headline act at Britain's first Vintage Computer Festival at The National Museum of Computing, Bletchley Park, in June 2010. On 9 September 2010, Trevor Horn announced that OMD would perform as a special guest at the \\"first live gig\\" of The Buggles. Their 11th studio album, History of Modern, was released in September, reaching No. 28 in the UK Albums Chart. A European tour followed in autumn. In March 2011, OMD played their first North American tour as the original line up since 1988. In September, the band appeared at the Electric Picnic 2011 festival in Stradbally, Co Laois, Ireland. In November 2011, OMD announced they were getting back to the studio to start work on their latest album, English Electric. On 12 March 2012, the band played a concert at the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines. In August, OMD performed to South African audiences in Cape Town and Johannesburg. On 29 January 2013, Goldenvoice announced that OMD will play the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, on 14 and 21 April. On 11 February, OMD announced \\"Metroland\\" would be the first single from the forthcoming album English Electric. The single was released on 25 March, and includes the B-side \\"The Great White Silence.\\" The album English Electric was released in the UK on 8 April and entered the UK album chart at No. 12 and the German chart at No. 10\\\\. Reviews for both the album and their concerts have generally been positive. For Record Store Day 2013, on 20 April, a 500-copy limited edition 10-inch picture disc EP \\"The Future Will Be Silent\\" from English Electric was made available, which includes a then-exclusive non-album track titled \\"Time Burns\\". For Record Store Day 2015, on 18 April, a 1000-copy limited edition 10-inch EP \\"Julia's Song (Dub Version)\\" from Junk Culture was made available, which includes an exclusive non-album track titled \\"10 to 1\\". The band performed a one-off concert at The Royal Albert Hall, London on 9 May 2016 to a sell-out crowd, playing both Architecture & Morality and Dazzle Ships in their entirety, along with other songs that were pre-1983. The only song post 1983 they played was \\"History of Modern Part 1\\". The concert was recorded and made available on double CD right after the show. A triple LP vinyl recording of the concert was also made available. OMD collaborated with Gary Barlow, Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman on the song \\"Thrill Me\\", co-written by Barlow and McCluskey for the soundtrack of the film Eddie the Eagle.Fly: Songs Inspired by the Film Eddie the Eagle. AllMusic. Retrieved 11 November 2016. In October, work was begun on what was to be their 13th studio album The Punishment of Luxury, which was released on 1 September 2017. OMD toured Europe and North America in support of the album, with Stuart Kershaw replacing Holmes as the band's drummer. In 2018, OMD published a book entitled \\"Pretending to See the Future\\", which is a first-person \\"autobiography\\" about the band. It mixed fan-submitted memories with commentary from McCluskey, Humphreys, Cooper, Holmes, and Kershaw. For people who pre-ordered the book on PledgeMusic, they received a limited-edition flexi-disc containing a previously unheard demo of \\"Messages\\" from 1978. As part of the group's 40th- anniversary celebrations, a UK and European tour was announced in March 2019. A retrospective deluxe boxset entitled Souvenir was also announced in August 2019. The 40th anniversary collection will include the group's forty singles, including new release \\"Don't Go\\". It will also contain 22 previously unreleased recordings from the group's archive, selected and mixed by Paul Humphreys. Two audio live shows, one from 2011 and one from 2013, are also included together with two DVDs bringing together two more live concerts ‚Äì Drury Lane in 1981 and Sheffield City Hall in 1985 ‚Äì plus Crush ‚Äì The Movie, and various BBC TV performances from Top of the Pops, The Old Grey Whistle Test and Later... with Jools Holland. The 40th anniversary has seen their first since \\"Electricity\\" reach the charts for the first time, albeit in Scotland, reaching #22 in its first week. Legacy and influence Critic Hugo Lindgren wrote that OMD have cultivated a \\"legacy as musical innovators\\". In February 2007 a Scotsman journalist said: \\"If Kraftwerk were the Elvis Presley of synth-pop, then Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were its Beatles.\\" In 2008, American publication The A.V. Club noted that McCluskey and Humphreys were \\"often labeled as the 'Lennon-McCartney of synth-pop.'\\" In a 2008 piece on OMD, The Quietus magazine editor John Doran called them \\"the only Liverpool band to come near to living up to the monolithic standards of productivity and creativity set in place by the Beatles,\\" and asserted: \\"Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark are not one of the best synth bands ever: they are one of the best bands ever.\\" Veteran BBC DJ Simon Mayo described OMD as \\"the fathers of electronic music in this country [the UK].\\" OMD's experimental brand of synth- pop has garnered limited mainstream attention. The group generally eschew choruses, replacing them with synthesizer lines, and opt for unconventional lyrical subjects such as war and machinery;Stanley, Bob.

Retrieved 13 June 2013. the BBC wrote that \\"OMD were always more intellectual\\" than \\"contemporaries like Duran Duran and Eurythmics\\". The band also rejected celebrity status and strove \\"to have no image\\". Despite the group's experimentation, they had an established knack for pop hooks; AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne wrote that OMD's music was \\"a step above other keyboard pop music of the time, thanks to the combination of intelligently crafted hooks and colorful rhythms\\". DeGagne's colleague Jon O'Brien remarked that the outfit were \\"ahead of their time\\". McCluskey in 2010 opined that OMD had become \\"the forgotten band\\" (he had predicted in 1981, at the peak of the group's popularity, that they would soon be forgottenWest, p. 31). The band have nonetheless earned a growing cult following. DJ Chris Evans remarked: \\"There are fans, and then there are OMD fans. [Their] fans may be among the greatest in the world... they are devout.\\" OMD have come to be regarded as one of the great Liverpool acts of the 1980s,Hickling, Alfred. The Electric Hills.

Architecture & Morality (1981), regarded as the group's seminal work, had sold more than 4 million copies by early 2007; Sugar Tax (1991), the album that marked a commercial renaissance for the band, had sold more than three million by the same time period. The experimental Dazzle Ships (1983), while not as commercially successful, has been retrospectively praised by critics. OMD's overall record sales stand in excess of 40 million. The group regularly features on 1980s compilation albums and box sets; multiple OMD tracks feature on each of the three volumes of Ministry of Sound's Anthems: Electronic 80s series.Anthems: Electronic 80s at AllMusic.Anthems: Electronic 80s 2 at AllMusic.Anthems: Electronic 80s 3 at AllMusic.

In a reflective 2006 article, Sean O'Neal in The A.V. Club said OMD would \\"give up\\" creatively after 1983's Dazzle Ships. The Quietus writer Julian Marszalek in 2010 suggested that the band would have been \\"more fondly remembered\\" had they split up after releasing that album, rather than in 1996. Conversely, Marszalek's colleague John Doran said: \\"It's quite popular to see OMD as nose-diving into the effluence after Dazzle Ships but the truth is there is still much to recommend\\". Ian Peel, in a piece written for Record Collector, opined that the group's legacy consisted of \\"two brilliant, but very different, bands\\". In contrast to other critics, AllMusic journalist Dave Thompson saw Junk Culture as part of the group's early experimental tenure, and considered 1985 ‚Äì the year in which they issued sixth album Crush ‚Äì as their shift toward the mainstream.\\"If You Leave \\" review at AllMusic. OMD's recent work ‚Äì specifically English Electric (2013) ‚Äì has been seen as more akin to their early output. =Impact on other artists= As one of the new wave pioneers, OMD impacted several musical peers. Vince Clarke, original composer of Depeche Mode, and later songwriter of the bands Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure, said that \\"Electricity\\" \\"really made me want to make electronic music, 'cause it was so (sic) unique\\". He noted that \\"Almost\\" was \\"what motivated me to actually buy a synthesiser\\", adding that \\"OMD sounded more home-made, and I suddenly thought, 'I can do that!' There was this sudden connection\\". Tony Kanal of No Doubt lauded OMD, and recalled: \\"As pop songs, the early stuff like 'Electricity' and 'Enola Gay' were such inspirations to [singer] Gwen [Stefani] and I, especially melodically.\\" Howard Jones credited them as a prominent influence in his early career, and \\"used to cover 'Enola Gay' in my set when I was starting out, because I loved the simplicity of it and the electronicness of it\\". IDM pioneer Mike \\"Œº-Ziq\\" Paradinas also named OMD as an inspiration, while Jim Kerr of Simple Minds recalled: \\"'I bought ['Electricity'] and played it nonstop, as I eventually did with the accompanying track called 'Almost'. I was downright jealous to be honest, and I still am when I hear those tunes!\\" Ian Wade in The Quietus wrote that OMD's 1983 album Dazzle Ships is \\"held close to the hearts\\" of multiple artists. Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley said it was \\"a huge influence on us ‚Äì a massive pop group putting together two or three recognisable pop songs and loads of found sounds.\\" Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie called the \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"daring\\" record \\"a big chunk of the inspiration\\" for his group's Codes and Keys (2011). Mark Ronson, to whom the album was recommended by singer Amanda \\"MNDR\\" Warner, remarked: \\"I was just completely floored [...] It's just so elegant but a bit lo-fi at the same time.\\" Terre Thaemlitz, another proponent of Dazzle Ships, owns five different pressings of the LP. Several 21st-century acts have namechecked OMD. Kristian Bush of Sugarland, whose 2010 album The Incredible Machine was influenced by the band, stated: \\"OMD wasn't something you got a lot when growing up in eastern Tennessee [...] Who's making those songs today‚Äîthose anthemic songs?\\" Peter Mor√©n of Peter Bjorn and John cited the group as an inspiration for Living Thing (2009), noting that his band recalled listening to OMD on the radio while growing up. Liars frontman Angus Andrew pointed to Dazzle Ships as one of his favourite records, while noting that he is \\"a fan of OMD albums from all of their phases.\\" He added: \\"It's kinda strange to us that we've never been compared to OMD [...] we do realise it would be an enormous compliment.\\" Michael Lerner of Telekinesis became \\"obsessed\\" with OMD's early 1980s work, and in particular, \\"fell in love\\" with Dazzle Ships. Nicholas \\"Gravenhurst\\" Talbot professed to \\"love\\" the band, and recalled how seeing \\"the video to [OMD's] 'Souvenir' [...] on Top of the Pops is one of my earliest memories.\\" LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy related that he has a fondness for early OMD dating to childhood, describing it as \\"the kind of music you loved in your room, but the minute someone else walked in who didn't like that kind of music, you suddenly realised how fey and absurd it was.

Her campaign was initiated following her correspondence and visits that she maintained with two convicted murderers. She began this ministry in 1982. The first man was Elmo Patrick Sonnier, who was sentenced to death by electric chair. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his execution. The second was Robert Lee Willie for whom she also served as spiritual adviser. Prejean gained insight into the minds of the convicted murderers, the process involved in executions, and the effects on the prison guards and other personnel. She became convinced that the state's use of the death penalty was morally wrong and began speaking out against capital punishment. At the same time, she founded Survive, an organization devoted to providing counseling to the families of victims of violence. Name The title of the book comes from a once-traditional phrase in American prisons to designate men who had been sentenced to death. They were held on what was known as death row and were deprived of most social contact and barred from work or participation in prison programs. Prior to the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, \\"Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!\\" The origin of the phrase is unknown. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners to let them know that they should be on their guard since a death row prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of honorific declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way, death row prisoners being seen as an elite within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a stigma attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him to avoid catching his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already. Adaptations =Film= In 1995, a film based on the book was made, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. =Opera= The book was adapted as an opera of the same name, composed by Jake Heggie with a libretto by playwright Terrence McNally. It premiered at the San Francisco Opera in October 2000. The international premiere of the opera was in August 2003, in Adelaide. It has been produced in several other cities, including by the Union Avenue Opera in St. Louis, Missouri. In November 2019, Lyric Opera of Chicago will present their premiere of the opera. =Stage version of the book/film= References * Prejean, Helen (1993). Dead Man Walking. Random House.

A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft. Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses an external propeller in the water below or behind the boat, a jetboat draws the water from under the boat through an intake and into a pump-jet inside the boat, before expelling it through a nozzle at the stern. Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton in 1954. His goal was a boat to run up the fast-flowing rivers of New Zealand that were too shallow for propellers. Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes, generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers. Unlike these previous waterjet developments, such as Campini's and the Hanley Hydrojet, Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very shallow water, and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution. The popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly. It was found the waterjet was better than propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and waterjets are now used widely for many high-speed vessels including passenger ferries, rescue craft, patrol boats and offshore supply vessels. Jetboats are highly manoeuvrable, and many can be reversed from full speed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length, in a manoeuvre known as a \\"crash stop\\". The well known Hamilton turn or \\"jet spin\\" is a high-speed manoeuvre where the boat's engine throttle is cut, the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again, causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water. There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats, though whether they are useful depends on the type of application. Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about , but as boat speed increases, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders, shafts and so on means waterjets are more efficient up to ). For very large propellers turning at slow speeds, such as in tugboats, the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical. The vast majority of waterjet units are therefore installed in high-speed vessels and in situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are the main concerns. The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use and the high-speed passenger and car ferry industry. South Africa's s (approximately long) and the long United States Littoral Combat Ship are among the biggest jet- propelled vessels so far. Even these vessels are capable of performing \\"crash stops\\". Function Jetboat on the Rogue River by Grants Pass, Oregon. A conventional screw propeller works within the body of water below a boat hull, effectively \\"screwing\\" through the water to drive a vessel forward by generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the propeller blades and by accelerating a mass of water rearward. By contrast, a waterjet unit delivers a high-pressure \\"push\\" from the stern of a vessel by accelerating a volume of water as it passes through a specialised pump mounted above the waterline inside the boat hull. Both methods yield thrust due to Newton's third law‚Äî every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In a jetboat, the waterjet draws water from beneath the hull, where it passes through a series of impellers and stators ‚Äì known as stages ‚Äì which increase the velocity of the waterflow. Most modern jets are single-stage, while older waterjets may have as many as three stages. The tail section of the waterjet unit extends out through the transom of the hull, above the waterline. This jetstream exits the unit through a small nozzle at high velocity to push the boat forward. Steering is accomplished by moving this nozzle to either side, or less commonly, by small gates on either side that deflect the jetstream. Because the jetboat relies on the flow of water through the nozzle for control, it is not possible to steer a conventional jetboat without the engine running. Shotover Canyon in New Zealand, the country for which jetboats were originally invented. Unlike conventional propeller systems where the rotation of the propeller is reversed to provide astern movement, a waterjet will continue to pump normally while a deflector is lowered into the jetstream after it leaves the outlet nozzle. This deflector redirects thrust forces forward to provide reverse thrust. Most highly developed reverse deflectors redirect the jetstream down and to each side to prevent recirculation of the water through the jet again, which may cause aeration problems, or increase reverse thrust. Steering is still available with the reverse deflector lowered so the vessel will have full maneuverability. With the deflector lowered about halfway into the jetstream, forward and reverse thrust are equal so the boat maintains a fixed position, but steering is still available to allow the vessel to turn on the spot ‚Äì something which is impossible with a conventional single propeller. Unlike hydrofoils, which use underwater wings or struts to lift the vessel clear of the water, standard jetboats use a conventional planing hull to ride across the water surface, with only the rear portion of the hull displacing any water. With the majority of the hull clear of the water, there is reduced drag, greatly enhancing speed and maneuverability, so jetboats are normally operated at planing speed. At slower speeds with less water pumping through the jet unit, the jetboat will lose some steering control and maneuverability and will quickly slow down as the hull comes off its planing state and hull resistance is increased. However, loss of steering control at low speeds can be overcome by lowering the reverse deflector slightly and increasing throttle ‚Äì so an operator may increase thrust and thus control without increasing boat speed itself. A conventional river-going jetboat will have a shallow-angled (but not flat-bottomed) hull to improve its high-speed cornering control and stability, while also allowing it to traverse very shallow water. At speed, jetboats can be safely operated in less than 7.5 cm (3 inches) of water. A jetboat powers through the rapids of Niagara Gorge, near Niagara Falls. One of the most significant breakthroughs, in the development of the waterjet, was to change the design so it expelled the jetstream above the water line, contrary to many people's intuition. Hamilton discovered early on that this greatly improved performance, compared to expelling below the waterline, while also providing a \\"clean\\" hull bottom (i.e. nothing protruding below the hull line) to allow the boat to skim through very shallow water. It makes no difference to the amount of thrust generated whether the outlet is above or below the waterline, but having it above the waterline reduces hull resistance and draught. Hamilton's first waterjet design had the outlet below the hull and actually in front of the inlet. This probably meant that disturbed water was entering the jet unit and reducing its performance, and the main reason why the change to above the waterline made such a difference. Queenstown, New Zealand, where jetboats are used extensively for adventure tourism, claims to be the jetboat capital of the world, and jetboats are very common for many coastal and riverine tourism activities in the country, such as the Excitor in the Bay of Islands. Applications USMC Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. Note the bow, which is extended into hydroplaning position. Applications for jetboats include most activities where conventional propellers are also used, but in particular passenger ferry services, coastguard and police patrol, navy and military, adventure tourism (which is becoming increasingly popular around the globe), pilot boat operations, surf rescue, farming, fishing, exploration, pleasure boating, and other water activities where motor boats are used. Jetboats can also be raced for sport, both on rivers (World Champion Jet Boat Marathon held in Mexico, Canada, USA and New Zealand) and on specially designed racecourses known as sprint tracks. Recently there has been increasing use of jetboats in the form of rigid-hulled inflatable boats and as luxury yacht tenders. Many jetboats are small enough to be carried on a trailer and towed by car. One very important feature of the jetboat is the fact that it has no external rotating parts; it is thus safer for swimmers and marine life, though these can still be struck by the hull. The safety benefit itself can sometimes be reason enough to use this type of propulsion. In 1977, Sir Edmund Hillary led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source. One of the jetboats was sunk by a friend of Hillary. Drawbacks The fuel efficiency and performance of a jetboat can be affected by anything that disrupts the smooth flow of water through the jet unit. For example, a plastic bag sucked onto the jet unit's intake grill can have quite an adverse effect. Another disadvantage of jetboats appears to be that they are more sensitive to engine/jet unit mismatch, compared with the problem of engine/propeller mismatch in propeller- driven craft. If the jet-propulsion unit is not well-matched to the engine performance, inefficient fuel consumption and poor performance can result.

(born April 21, 1939) is a Roman Catholic sister, a member of the Congregation of St. Joseph based in New Orleans, and a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Prejean founded the groups SURVIVE to help families of victims of murder and related crimes. She served as the National Chairperson of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1993 to 1995. She helped establish The Moratorium Campaign, seeking an end to executions and conducting education on the death penalty. She is known for her best-selling book, Dead Man Walking (1993), based on her experiences with two convicts on death row for whom she served as spiritual adviser before their executions. In her book, she explored the effects of the death penalty on everyone involved. The book was adapted as a 1995 film of the same name, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. It was also adapted as an opera, first produced in 2000 by the San Francisco Opera. Early life and education Helen Prejean was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the daughter of Augusta Mae (n√©e Bourg; 1911‚Äì1993), a nurse, and Louis Sebastian Prejean (1893‚Äì1974), a lawyer. She joined the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille in 1957. In 1962, she received a Bachelor of Arts in English and Education from St. Mary's Dominican College, New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1973, she earned a Master of Arts in religious education from Saint Paul University, an affiliated college of the University of Ottawa. She has been the Religious Education Director at St. Frances Cabrini Parish in New Orleans, the Formation Director for her religious community, and has taught junior and senior high school. Death row ministry Her efforts began in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1981. In 1982 an acquaintance asked her to correspond with convicted murderer Elmo Patrick Sonnier, held on death row in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola. Sonnier had been sentenced to death by electrocution. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his execution. The experience gave Prejean greater insight into the process involved in executions, for the convict, families, and others in the prison, and she began speaking out against capital punishment. At the same time, she founded Survive, an organization devoted to counseling the families of victims of violence. Prejean has since ministered to other inmates on death row and witnessed several more executions. She served as National Chairperson of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty from 1993 to 1995. Louisiana State Penitentiary, where Sonnier was incarcerated. Dead Man Walking She published Dead Man Walking (1993), an account of her relationship with Sonnier and other inmates on death row, and the factors related to her growing opposition to the death penalty. The book was adapted for a 1995 feature film of the same name; she was portrayed by Susan Sarandon. Her book also was adapted as an opera of the same name, first produced by the San Francisco Opera in 2000. The libretto is by Terrence McNally and the music composed by Jake Heggie. It has also been adapted as a play of the same name, which was first produced in autumn 2003. For her book, she drew from her experiences with Sonnier and with the convict Robert Lee Willie. He had been sentenced to death after being convicted of kidnapping and murder in two attacks in May 1980. Prejean also explored the effects that conducting the death penalty has on attorneys, prison guards, other prison officials, and the families of both convicted murderers and their victims. Since then Prejean has worked with other men sentenced to death. In December 2010, Prejean donated all of her archival papers to DePaul University. Campaigns, book, and awards In 1996, she was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, the oldest and most prestigious award for American Catholics. In 1999, Prejean formed Moratorium 2000, a petition drive that eventually grew into a national education campaign, The Moratorium Campaign, seeking to declare a moratorium to executions. It was initially staffed by Robert Jones, Theresa Meisz, and Jen√© O'Keefe. The organization Witness to Innocence, composed of death row survivors who were exonerated after being convicted for crimes they did not commit, was started under The Moratorium Campaign. Prejean wrote a second book, The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions (2004). She tells of two men, Dobie Gillis Williams and Joseph O'Dell, whom she accompanied to their executions. She believes that both men were innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted. The book also examines the recent history of death penalty decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States and the record of George W. Bush as Governor of Texas. In 1998, Prejean was given the Pacem in Terris Award, named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls on all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. Pacem in terris is Latin for \\"Peace on Earth.\\" Prejean now bases her work at the death Penalty Discourse Network in New Orleans. She gives talks about the issues across the United States and around the world. She and her sister Mary Ann Antrobus have also been deeply involved at a center in Nicaragua called Friends of Batahola. In 2019 she wrote a memoir titled River of Fire: My Spiritual Journey. In it she talks about her spiritual journey leading her to engage in social justice work.

Set in Arkansas (filmed in Benton, Arkansas) the film tells the story of a man named Karl Childers who has an intellectual disability and is released from a psychiatric hospital, where he has lived since killing his mother and her lover when he was 12 years old, and the friendship he develops with a young boy and his mother. In addition to Thornton, it stars Dwight Yoakam, J. T. Walsh, John Ritter, Lucas Black, Natalie Canerday, James Hampton, and Robert Duvall. The film was adapted by Thornton from his previous one-man show entitled Swine Before Pearls, from which he developed a screenplay for the 1994 short film Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade, directed by George Hickenlooper. Sling Blade proved to be a sleeper hit, launching Thornton into stardom. It won the Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and Thornton was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The music for the soundtrack was provided by French Canadian artist/producer Daniel Lanois. Sling Blade was filmed over the course of 12 days on location in Benton, Arkansas. and was produced by David L. Bushell and Brandon Rosser. Plot In the mid-1990s, Karl Childers is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12; at that age, he murdered his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, and he recounts committing the murders with a kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl explains that he attended school with his father's boss' teenage son Jesse Dixon, who was a mean-spirited bully and pervert; he thought that Jesse was raping his mother, and decapitated him. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization, Karl - who is highly skilled at repairing small engines - lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley, and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed when he was hit by a train, leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham. Vaughan is the manager of the dollar store where Linda works. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage - which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves. Karl bonds with Linda, Vaughan, and their friends. Vaughan invites Karl to lunch where he explains that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. He also warns Karl about Doyle's violent demeanor as well as his fears that Doyle might hurt or kill Linda and Frank. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his real father and despises Doyle. For Karl, Frank becomes like a younger brother. As they grow closer, Karl reveals to Frank that he is haunted by an incident that happened when he was six or eight years old. His parents performed an abortion of his unwanted baby brother. The baby was wrapped in a bloody towel and given to Karl with instructions to \\"get rid of it\\"; however, Karl realized that the infant survived the abortion. When Frank asks why Karl did not keep the baby, Karl replies that he had no way to care for it. He placed the baby, still in the bloody towel, inside a shoebox and buried it alive. He went on to say it was better to \\"return him to the good Lord right off the bat,\\" sparing him the abuse and neglect Karl himself had received at the hands of his own father. Karl later visits his father, who has become a sickly hermit living in the dilapidated home where Karl grew up. The father claims he doesn't recognize Karl and doesn't have a son. Karl tells his father that killing his baby brother was wrong, and that he had wanted to kill his father for making him do it, but eventually decided that he was not worth the effort. Karl thereafter decides to be baptized. Doyle continues his abusive behavior. While practicing with his friends, with whom he is in a band, he erupts in an alcoholic outburst, ejects them from the house, and attempts to do the same with Karl and Vaughan. Linda tries ejecting Doyle from the house, despite his threats to kill her if she ever left him, which results in a physical confrontation. Frank is enraged and hurls household objects at Doyle until he finally leaves. Linda and Doyle reconcile and Doyle announces his plan to move into the house permanently. He claims he will soon propose marriage to Linda, that Karl is no longer welcome to live in the house, and demands that Frank begin obeying his orders. Frank does not acquiesce and Doyle attempts to attack him, but Karl stops him and warns him never to touch Frank again. Karl begins to realize that, eventually, either Frank will kill Doyle and end up just like him, or that Doyle's abuse will end up killing Frank and Linda. In order to prevent this, Karl makes Frank promise to spend the night at Vaughan's house. Karl then goes to Vaughan's house and asks Vaughan to pick up Linda and have her stay over also. Karl later returns to Linda's house with a lawnmower blade he had sharpened and fashioned into a weapon. He finds a drunken Doyle sitting on the couch inside and asks him how to reach the police by phone. Doyle, in turn, asks what Karl is doing with the lawnmower blade; Karl replies, \\"I aim to kill you with it‚Äù. Not taking Karl seriously, Doyle sarcastically recommends that Karl dial 911 and request \\"an ambulance or a hearse\\". Karl then kills Doyle with two blows of the blade to the head, phones the police to turn himself in, and requests a hearse be sent for Doyle. He eats biscuits and mustard while waiting for the police. Returned to the state hospital, he is less passive than he was during his previous institutionalization, having learned the value of sacrificing one‚Äôs self to save others. He silences a sexual predator who had previously forced him to listen to stories about his crimes, before standing to look out of a window towards an open field.

It is named after the open star cluster known in English as the Pleiades. It had the largest monolithic primary mirror in the world from its commissioning until 2005.  Overview  The Subaru Telescope is a Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope. Instruments can be mounted at a Cassegrain focus below the primary mirror; at either of two Nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount, to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror, an arrangement rare on large telescopes, to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys. In 1984, the University of Tokyo formed an engineering working group to develop and study the concept of a telescope. In 1985, the astronomy committee of Japan's science council gave top priority to the development of a \\"Japan National Large Telescope\\" (JNLT), and in 1986, the University of Tokyo signed an agreement with the University of Hawaii to build the telescope in Hawaii. In 1988, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan was formed through a reorganization of the University's Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, to oversee the JNLT and other large national astronomy projects. Construction of the Subaru telescope began in April 1991, and later that year, a public contest gave the telescope its official name, \\"Subaru Telescope.\\" Construction was completed in 1998, and the first scientific images were taken in January 1999. In September 1999, Princess Sayako of Japan dedicated the telescope. A number of state-of-the-art technologies were worked into the telescope design. For example, 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath, which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation. The telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence. Subaru is one of the few state-of-the-art telescopes to have been used with the naked eye. For the dedication, an eyepiece was constructed so that Princess Sayako could look through it directly. It was enjoyed by the staff for a few nights until it was replaced with the much more sensitive working instruments. Subaru is the primary tool in the search for Planet Nine. Its large field of view, 75 times that of the Keck telescopes, and strong light-gathering power are suited for deep wide-field sky surveys. The search, split between a research group led by Batygin and Brown and another led by Sheppard and Trujillo, is expected to take up to five years. = Accidents during construction = Two separate incidents claimed the lives of four workers during the construction of the telescope. On October 13, 1993, 42-year-old Paul F. Lawrence was fatally injured when a forklift tipped over onto him. On January 16, 1996, sparks from a welder ignited insulation which smoldered, generating noxious smoke that killed Marvin Arruda, 52, Ricky Del Rosario, 38, and Warren K. \\"Kip\\" Kaleo, 36, and sent twenty-six other workers to the hospital in Hilo. All four workers are memorialized by a plaque outside the base of the telescope dome and a sign posted temporarily each January along the Mauna Kea access road. =Mishap in 2011= On July 2, 2011, the telescope operator in Hilo noted an anomaly from the top unit of the telescope. Upon further examination, coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope. Observation using Nasmyth foci resumed on July 22, and Cassegrain focus resumed on August 26.  Instruments  The Subaru alongside the twin W. M.

Autoconf is agnostic about the programming languages used, but it is often used for projects using C, C++, Fortran, Fortran 77, Erlang or Objective-C. A configure script configures a software package for installation on a particular target system. After running a series of tests on the target system, the configure script generates header files and a makefile from templates, thus customizing the software package for the target system. Together with Automake and Libtool, Autoconf forms the GNU Build System, which comprises several other tools, notably Autoheader.  Usage overview  Flow diagram of autoconf and automake. Note that \\"configure.ac\\" was named \\"configure.in\\" in early versions of autoconf. The developer specifies the desired behaviour of the configure script by writing a list of instructions in the GNU m4 language in a file called \\"configure.ac\\". A library of pre-defined m4 macros is available to describe common configure script instructions. Autoconf transforms the instructions in \\"configure.ac\\" into a portable configure script. The system that will be doing the building need not have autoconf installed: autoconf is needed only to build the configure script, that is usually shipped with the software.  History  Autoconf was begun in the summer of 1991 by David Mackenzie to support his work at the Free Software Foundation. In the subsequent years it grew to include enhancements from a variety of authors and became the most widely used build configuration system for writing portable free or open-source software.  Approach  Autoconf is similar to the Metaconfig package used by Perl. The imake system formerly used by the X Window System (up to X11R6.9) is closely related, but has a different philosophy. The Autoconf approach to portability is to test for features, not for versions. For example, the native C compiler on SunOS 4 did not support ISO C. However, it is possible for the user or administrator to have installed an ISO C-compliant compiler. A pure version-based approach would not detect the presence of the ISO C compiler, but a feature-testing approach would be able to discover the ISO C compiler the user had installed. The rationale of this approach is to gain the following advantages: * the configure script can get reasonable results on newer or unknown systems * it allows administrators to customize their machines and have the configure script take advantage of the customizations * there is no need to keep track of minute details of versions, patch numbers, etc., to figure out whether a particular feature is supported or not Autoconf provides extensive documentation around the non- portability of many POSIX shell constructs to older shells and bugs therein. It also provides M4SH, a macro-based replacement for shell syntax. Criticism There is some criticism that states that Autoconf uses dated technologies, has a lot of legacy restrictions, and complicates simple scenarios unnecessarily for the author of configure.ac scripts. In particular, often cited weak points of Autoconf are: * General complexity of used architecture, most projects use multiple repetitions. * Generated 'configure' is written in Bourne shell and thus Makefile generation is slow. * Some people think that 'configure' scripts generated by autoconf provide only manual- driven command-line interface without any standardization. While it is true that some developers do not respect common conventions, such conventions do exist and are widely used. * M4 is unusual and unknown to many developers. Developers will need to learn it to extend autoconf with non-standard checks. * Weak backward and forward compatibility requires a wrapper script. * Autoconf-generated scripts are usually large and rather complex. Although they produce extensive logging, debugging them can still be difficult. Due to these limitations, several projects that used GNU Build System switched to different build systems, such as CMake and SCons.

It is approximately 22 micrograms, or roughly the mass of a flea egg. Unlike some other Planck units, such as Planck length, Planck mass is not a fundamental lower or upper bound; instead, Planck mass is a unit of mass defined using only what Max Planck considered fundamental and universal units. For comparison, this value is of the order of 1015 (a quadrillion) times larger than the highest energy available to particle accelerators as of 2015. It is defined as: :m_\\\\text{P}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{G}}, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, G is the gravitational constant, and ƒß is the reduced Planck constant.

Particle physicists and cosmologists often use an alternative normalization with the reduced Planck mass, which is :M_\\\\text{P} = \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{8\\\\pi G} \\\\approx\\\\ = . simplifies several other equations in general relativity.}} History  The Planck mass was first suggested by Max Planck in 1899. He suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for length, mass, time, and energy. He derived these units using only dimensional analysis of what he considered the most fundamental universal constants: The speed of light, the Newton gravitational constant, and the Planck constant. Derivations =Dimensional analysis= The formula for the Planck mass can be derived by dimensional analysis. The basic idea is to find a quantity based on \\"universals\\" like the \\"speed of light in vacuum\\", that are both objective and invariant or unchangeable as we shift from one experimental or observational situation to another. This is a somewhat idealized perspective, as we must think in a framework that is not experimentally accessible. For example, even if the speed of light is observed and estimated and is measured under careful conditions closely approximating \\"vacuum\\" (insofar as we can do so), we do not necessarily know if the results (under repeated identical conditions) which may well show some variability, indicate a flaw in our assumption of universal speed, for light, or is correlated with factors such as possible biases or mistakes we ourselves are making, or certain ambiguities inherent in the experimental set up. But the goal is to remove traces of the particular experiments or observations and concomitant specific measured quantities, like length or time that bear on a speed measurement. In this context, too, we must ask ourselves what \\"universal\\" quantities are relevant for mass estimations in experiments. The acceleration due to gravity, g, on the surface of the Earth is not quite an objective constant, but close enough for that environment under numerous typical conditions. Likewise, when we consider the general astrophysical context of stars, planets, etc. Newton's gravitation constant G seems to represent an adequate \\"universal\\" under numerous ordinary experimental or observational conditions. In this approach, one starts with the three physical constants ƒß, c, and G, and attempts to combine them to get a quantity whose dimension is mass. The formula sought is of the form :m_\\\\text{P} = c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\\\hbar^{n_3}, where n_1,n_2,n_3 are constants to be determined by equating the dimensions of both sides. Using the symbols \\\\mathsf{M} for mass, \\\\mathsf{L} for length and \\\\mathsf{T} for time, and writing [] to denote the dimension of some physical quantity , we have the following: :\\\\,[c]\\\\,=\\\\mathsf{L}\\\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\\\ :[G]=\\\\mathsf{M}^{-1}\\\\mathsf{L}^3\\\\mathsf{T}^{-2} :\\\\,[\\\\hbar]\\\\,=\\\\mathsf{M}\\\\mathsf{L}^2\\\\mathsf{T}^{-1} \\\\ . Therefore, :[c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \\\\hbar^{n_3}] = \\\\mathsf{M}^{-n_2+n_3} \\\\mathsf{L}^{n_1+3n_2+2n_3} \\\\mathsf{T}^{-n_1-2n_2-n_3}. If one wants this to equal \\\\mathsf{M}, the dimension of mass, using \\\\mathsf{M} = \\\\mathsf{M}^1\\\\mathsf{L}^0\\\\mathsf{T}^0, the following equations need to hold: :~~~~~~~~~-n_2 + ~~n_3 = 1 \\\\ :~~~n_1 + 3n_2 + 2n_3 = 0 \\\\ :-n_1 - 2n_2 - ~~n_3 = 0 \\\\ . The solution of this system is: :n_1 = 1/2, n_2 = -1/2, n_3 = 1/2. \\\\ Thus, the Planck mass is: :m_\\\\text{P} = c^{1/2}G^{-1/2}\\\\hbar^{1/2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c\\\\hbar}{G}}\\\\ . Dimensional analysis can only determine a formula up to a dimensionless multiplicative factor. There is no a priori reason for starting with the reduced Planck constant ƒß instead of the original Planck constant h, which differs from it by a factor of 2œÄ. =Elimination of a coupling constant= Equivalently, the Planck mass is defined such that the gravitational potential energy between two masses mP of separation r is equal to the energy of a photon (or the mass‚Äìenergy of a graviton, if such a particle exists) of angular wavelength r (see the Planck relation), or that their ratio equals one. :E=\\\\frac{G m_\\\\text{P}^2}{r}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar c}{r}\\\\ .

Co-stars include Patricia Richardson, Christine Dunford, Tom Wood, Jessica Biel, J. Kenneth Campbell and Vanessa Zima. It was released by Orion Pictures, with Jonathan Demme receiving presenter credits for his role in the film's financing. The film was the \\"Centerpiece Premiere\\" at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.\\"Making of\\" pamphlet accompanying the DVD release Fonda won a Golden Globe Award for his performance and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and a Screen Actors Guild Award. The film's title refers most concretely to the honey Ulee produces as a beekeeper, particularly that made from the nectar of the tupelo tree. Van Morrison sings \\"Tupelo Honey\\" (the title song of his 1971 album) over the end credits. Plot Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda) is a widowed beekeeper in Wewahitchka, Florida whose son Jimmy (Tom Wood) is in prison following a botched robbery. Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) has abandoned their two daughters and is living in Orlando. Ulee's stubborn independence prevents him from asking for help, and as the movie begins he has his hands full running his business and acting as surrogate parent to his granddaughters Casey and Penny. Casey (Jessica Biel) is a rebellious teenager and Penny (Vanessa Zima) is a timid 10-year-old who seems confused by her parents' absence and the tension at home. When Ulee visits Jimmy in prison, Jimmy tells him that Helen has turned up at the Orlando home of petty criminals Eddie Flowers and Ferris Dooley. They were Jimmy's accomplices in the bank robbery, but were never caught. Now they say Helen is sick, and Jimmy asks Ulee to bring her home. Ulee goes to Orlando to pick up Helen, but it turns out what Eddie and Ferris really want is the bank money that Jimmy allegedly hid after the robbery. Ulee agrees to ask Jimmy about it, and then takes Helen home. Helen's \\"illness\\" is actually drug addiction, and while she is almost comatose on the way home, she becomes violent and belligerent as she wakes up near the house. Ulee's tenant and neighbor, a divorced nurse named Connie Hope (Patricia Richardson), is brought into the home by a frightened Penny, and over the next few days she helps Helen through her drug withdrawal. Meanwhile, Ulee learns that Jimmy hid the bank money in one of his beeyards. He tells Eddie and Ferris he'll bring the money to Orlando in a few days, but they decide they can't wait and take Helen, Casey, and Penny hostage in Ulee's home. Helen, Casey, and Penny are then tied up and left at the home as Eddie and Ferris force Ulee at gunpoint to take them to the beeyard, where he shows them the hiding place. As they are recovering the money, Ulee kicks the gun into the swamp. The angry men ride with Ulee back into town, then Eddie stabs him in the parking lot when they arrive. As Ulee stumbles bleeding, Eddie and Ferris drive off but are pulled over almost immediately by the sheriff, Bill Floyd (J. Kenneth Campbell). The film ends with a newly hopeful Jackson household. Helen has stepped back into her role as a mother, and Jimmy expects to be paroled soon. Ulee is happy to return to his bees, but has mixed feelings about giving up some of his responsibilities. As he recovers from his knife wound he begins work on expanding his business to accommodate Jimmy's eventual return, and seems to finally be taking a romantic interest in Connie.

Biography  Menachem Mendel Schneersohn was born in Liozna, on September 9, 1789. His mother Devorah Leah died just three years later, and her father Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi raised him as his own son. He married his first cousin Chaya Mushka Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Dovber Schneuri. After his father-in- law/uncle's death, and a three-year interregnum during which he tried to persuade the Hasidim to accept his brother-in-law Menachem-Nachum Schneuri or his uncle Chaim-Avraham as their leader, he assumed the leadership of Lubavitch on the eve of Shavuot 5591 (May 5, 1831 OS). He was known as the Tzemach Tzedek after the title of a voluminous compendium of Halakha (Jewish law) that he authored.\\"Tzemach\\" (◊¶◊û◊ó) has the same gematria as \\"Menachem\\" (◊û◊†◊ó◊ù), and \\"Tzedek\\" (◊¶◊ì◊ß) has the same as \\"Mendel\\" (◊û◊¢◊†◊ì◊ú). The original responsa Tzemach Tzedek were those of Menachem Mendel Krochmal. Schneersohn's responsa are known as Shu\\"t Tzemach Tzedek Hachadashot, \\"the new Tzemach Tzedek responsa\\". Rabbi Menachem Mendil Hager, the first Viznhitzer Rebbe, called his commentary on the Torah Tzemach Tzadik (◊¶◊û◊ó ◊¶◊ì◊ô◊ß), because he spelled his name with an extra yod (◊û◊¢◊†◊ì◊ô◊ú). He also authored Derech Mitzvotecha (\\"Way of Your Commandments\\"), a mystical exposition of the Mitzvos. He compiled major works of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi for publication, including the Siddur L'Kol Ha'Shanah (commonly known as Siddur Im Dach), Likutei Torah and Torah Ohr. He also authored a philosophical text entitled \\"Sefer Chakira: Derech Emuna\\" (Book of Philosophy: The Way of Faith). The Tzemach Tzedek enjoyed close ties with other Jewish leaders. In the course of his battle against the Haskalah in Russia, he forged a close alliance with Rabbi Yitzchak of Valozhyn, a major leader of the misnagdim, which led to warmer relations between them and the Hasidim.The Tzemach Tzedek and the Haskalah Movement, Official Chabad history. According to Baruch Epstein, his father Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein spent six months under the Tzemach Tzedek's tutelage, and learned most of his mystical knowledge during that time. This story is disputed by Hassidic historian Yehoshua Mondshine.The claim is in Mekor Baruch, chapter 20. But see Mekor Baruch - Mekor Hakzavim by Yehoshua Mondshein. His close friendship with professor J Berstenson, the Czar's court physician, often helped the delicate negotiations relating to the welfare of the community.Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Schneersohn, Menachem Mendel. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. He set up an organisation called Hevras Techiyas Hameisim to assist Jewish boy-soldiers who were being recruited and converted to Christianity by the Russian army. These soldiers known as Cantonists were taken away from the Jewish community to other villages. Schneersohn arranged for his students to pay them regular visits to keep up their spirits and discourage them from converting. In 1844‚Äì45 he took steps to increase the enrollment and viability of the Lubavitch Yeshivas in Dubro≈≠na, Pasana, Lyozno and Kalisz, expanding their enrollment to around 600 students in total. Repeated attempts by the authorities to entrap him using informers such as Hershel Hodesh, Benjamin the Apostate and Lipman Feldman failed.Sefer HaToldos Rav Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn MiLubavitch, Glitzenstein, A. H.  Death and legacy  He died in Lubavitch on March 17, 1866 at the age of 76, leaving behind him seven sons and two daughters. He was succeeded by his youngest son, Shmuel as the Rebbe of Lubavitch, while three of his other sons formed breakaways of the Chabad movement which continue to some extent even today. Several of his sons established Chasidic dynasties. (See #Sons.)  Famous quote  A famous saying of the Tzemach Tzedek is Think good and it will be good (original Yiddish: Trakht gut vet zein gut).

Collision detection is a classic issue of computational geometry and has applications in various computing fields, primarily in computer graphics, computer games, computer simulations, robotics and computational physics. Collision detection algorithms can be divided into operating on 2D and 3D objects.  Overview  Billiards balls hitting each other are a classic example applicable within the science of collision detection. In physical simulation, experiments, such as playing billiards, are conducted. The physics of bouncing billiard balls are well understood, under the umbrella of rigid body motion and elastic collisions. An initial description of the situation would be given, with a very precise physical description of the billiard table and balls, as well as initial positions of all the balls. Given a force applied to the cue ball (probably resulting from a player hitting the ball with his or her cue stick), we want to calculate the trajectories, precise motion, and eventual resting places of all the balls with a computer program. A program to simulate this game would consist of several portions, one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls. This particular example also turns out to be ill conditioned: a small error in any calculation will cause drastic changes in the final position of the billiard balls. Video games have similar requirements, with some crucial differences. While computer simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as precisely as possible, computer games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way, in real time and robustly. Compromises are allowed, so long as the resulting simulation is satisfying to the game players.  Collision detection in computer simulation  Physical simulators differ in the way they react on a collision. Some use the softness of the material to calculate a force, which will resolve the collision in the following time steps like it is in reality. Due to the low softness of some materials this is very CPU intensive. Some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation, roll back the simulation, and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws. Some iterate the linear interpolation (Newton's method) to calculate the time of collision with a much higher precision than the rest of the simulation. Collision detection utilizes time coherence to allow even finer time steps without much increasing CPU demand, such as in air traffic control. After an inelastic collision, special states of sliding and resting can occur and, for example, the Open Dynamics Engine uses constraints to simulate them. Constraints avoid inertia and thus instability. Implementation of rest by means of a scene graph avoids drift. In other words, physical simulators usually function one of two ways, where the collision is detected a posteriori (after the collision occurs) or a priori (before the collision occurs). In addition to the a posteriori and a priori distinction, almost all modern collision detection algorithms are broken into a hierarchy of algorithms. Often the terms \\"discrete\\" and \\"continuous\\" are used rather than a posteriori and a priori. = A posteriori (discrete) versus a priori (continuous) = In the a posteriori case, we advance the physical simulation by a small time step, then check if any objects are intersecting, or are somehow so close to each other that we deem them to be intersecting. At each simulation step, a list of all intersecting bodies is created, and the positions and trajectories of these objects are somehow \\"fixed\\" to account for the collision. We say that this method is a posteriori because we typically miss the actual instant of collision, and only catch the collision after it has actually happened. In the a priori methods, we write a collision detection algorithm which will be able to predict very precisely the trajectories of the physical bodies. The instants of collision are calculated with high precision, and the physical bodies never actually interpenetrate. We call this a priori because we calculate the instants of collision before we update the configuration of the physical bodies. The main benefits of the a posteriori methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need not be aware of the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn't need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies. In addition, the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms. Indeed, an a priori algorithm must deal with the time variable, which is absent from the a posteriori problem. On the other hand, a posteriori algorithms cause problems in the \\"fixing\\" step, where intersections (which aren't physically correct) need to be corrected. Moreover, if the discrete step is too large, the collision could go undetected, resulting in an object which passes through another if it is sufficiently fast or small. The benefits of the a priori algorithms are increased fidelity and stability. It is difficult (but not completely impossible) to separate the physical simulation from the collision detection algorithm. However, in all but the simplest cases, the problem of determining ahead of time when two bodies will collide (given some initial data) has no closed form solution‚Äîa numerical root finder is usually involved. Some objects are in resting contact, that is, in collision, but neither bouncing off, nor interpenetrating, such as a vase resting on a table. In all cases, resting contact requires special treatment: If two objects collide (a posteriori) or slide (a priori) and their relative motion is below a threshold, friction becomes stiction and both objects are arranged in the same branch of the scene graph.  Optimization  The obvious approaches to collision detection for multiple objects are very slow. Checking every object against every other object will, of course, work, but is too inefficient to be used when the number of objects is at all large. Checking objects with complex geometry against each other in the obvious way, by checking each face against each other face, is itself quite slow. Thus, considerable research has been applied to speed up the problem. = Exploiting temporal coherence = In many applications, the configuration of physical bodies from one time step to the next changes very little. Many of the objects may not move at all. Algorithms have been designed so that the calculations done in a preceding time step can be reused in the current time step, resulting in faster completion of the calculation. At the coarse level of collision detection, the objective is to find pairs of objects which might potentially intersect. Those pairs will require further analysis. An early high performance algorithm for this was developed by Ming C. Lin at the University of California, Berkeley , who suggested using axis-aligned bounding boxes for all n bodies in the scene. Each box is represented by the product of three intervals (i.e., a box would be I_1 \\\\times I_2 \\\\times I_3=[a_1,b_1] \\\\times [a_2,b_2] \\\\times [a_3,b_3]). A common algorithm for collision detection of bounding boxes is sweep and prune. We observe that two such boxes, I_1 \\\\times I_2 \\\\times I_3 and J_1 \\\\times J_2 \\\\times J_3 intersect if, and only if, I_1 intersects J_1, I_2 intersects J_2 and I_3 intersects J_3. We suppose that, from one time step to the next, I_k and J_k intersect, then it is very likely that at the next time step, they will still intersect. Likewise, if they did not intersect in the previous time step, then they are very likely to continue not to. So we reduce the problem to that of tracking, from frame to frame, which intervals do intersect. We have three lists of intervals (one for each axis) and all lists are the same length (since each list has length n, the number of bounding boxes.) In each list, each interval is allowed to intersect all other intervals in the list. So for each list, we will have an n \\\\times n matrix M=(m_{ij}) of zeroes and ones: m_{ij} is 1 if intervals i and j intersect, and 0 if they do not intersect. By our assumption, the matrix M associated to a list of intervals will remain essentially unchanged from one time step to the next. To exploit this, the list of intervals is actually maintained as a list of labeled endpoints. Each element of the list has the coordinate of an endpoint of an interval, as well as a unique integer identifying that interval. Then, we sort the list by coordinates, and update the matrix M as we go. It's not so hard to believe that this algorithm will work relatively quickly if indeed the configuration of bounding boxes does not change significantly from one time step to the next. In the case of deformable bodies such as cloth simulation, it may not be possible to use a more specific pairwise pruning algorithm as discussed below, and an n-body pruning algorithm is the best that can be done. If an upper bound can be placed on the velocity of the physical bodies in a scene, then pairs of objects can be pruned based on their initial distance and the size of the time step. = Pairwise pruning = Once we've selected a pair of physical bodies for further investigation, we need to check for collisions more carefully. However, in many applications, individual objects (if they are not too deformable) are described by a set of smaller primitives, mainly triangles. So now, we have two sets of triangles, S={S_1,S_2,\\\\dots,S_n} and T={T_1,T_2,\\\\dots,T_n} (for simplicity, we will assume that each set has the same number of triangles.) The obvious thing to do is to check all triangles S_j against all triangles T_k for collisions, but this involves n^2 comparisons, which is highly inefficient. If possible, it is desirable to use a pruning algorithm to reduce the number of pairs of triangles we need to check. The most widely used family of algorithms is known as the hierarchical bounding volumes method. As a preprocessing step, for each object (in our example, S and T) we will calculate a hierarchy of bounding volumes. Then, at each time step, when we need to check for collisions between S and T, the hierarchical bounding volumes are used to reduce the number of pairs of triangles under consideration. For simplicity, we will give an example using bounding spheres, although it has been noted that spheres are undesirable in many cases. If E is a set of triangles, we can precalculate a bounding sphere B(E). There are many ways of choosing B(E), we only assume that B(E) is a sphere that completely contains E and is as small as possible. Ahead of time, we can compute B(S) and B(T). Clearly, if these two spheres do not intersect (and that is very easy to test), then neither do S and T. This is not much better than an n-body pruning algorithm, however. If E={E_1,E_2,\\\\dots,E_m} is a set of triangles, then we can split it into two halves L(E):={E_1,E_2,\\\\dots,E_{m/2}} and R(E):={E_{m/2+1},\\\\dots,E_{m-1},E_m}. We can do this to S and T, and we can calculate (ahead of time) the bounding spheres B(L(S)),B(R(S)) and B(L(T)),B(R(T)). The hope here is that these bounding spheres are much smaller than B(S) and B(T). And, if, for instance, B(S) and B(L(T)) do not intersect, then there is no sense in checking any triangle in S against any triangle in L(T). As a precomputation, we can take each physical body (represented by a set of triangles) and recursively decompose it into a binary tree, where each node N represents a set of triangles, and its two children represent L(N) and R(N). At each node in the tree, we can precompute the bounding sphere B(N). When the time comes for testing a pair of objects for collision, their bounding sphere tree can be used to eliminate many pairs of triangles. Many variants of the algorithms are obtained by choosing something other than a sphere for B(T). If one chooses axis-aligned bounding boxes, one gets AABBTrees. Oriented bounding box trees are called OBBTrees. Some trees are easier to update if the underlying object changes. Some trees can accommodate higher order primitives such as splines instead of simple triangles. = Exact pairwise collision detection = Once we're done pruning, we are left with a number of candidate pairs to check for exact collision detection. A basic observation is that for any two convex objects which are disjoint, one can find a plane in space so that one object lies completely on one side of that plane, and the other object lies on the opposite side of that plane. This allows the development of very fast collision detection algorithms for convex objects. Early work in this area involved \\"separating plane\\" methods. Two triangles collide essentially only when they can not be separated by a plane going through three vertices. That is, if the triangles are {v_1,v_2,v_3} and {v_4,v_5,v_6} where each v_j is a vector in \\\\mathbb R^3, then we can take three vertices, v_i,v_j,v_k, find a plane going through all three vertices, and check to see if this is a separating plane. If any such plane is a separating plane, then the triangles are deemed to be disjoint. On the other hand, if none of these planes are separating planes, then the triangles are deemed to intersect. There are twenty such planes. If the triangles are coplanar, this test is not entirely successful. One can add some extra planes, for instance, planes that are normal to triangle edges, to fix the problem entirely. In other cases, objects that meet at a flat face must necessarily also meet at an angle elsewhere, hence the overall collision detection will be able to find the collision. Better methods have since been developed. Very fast algorithms are available for finding the closest points on the surface of two convex polyhedral objects. Early work by Ming C. Lin used a variation on the simplex algorithm from linear programming. The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm has superseded that approach. These algorithms approach constant time when applied repeatedly to pairs of stationary or slow-moving objects, when used with starting points from the previous collision check. The end result of all this algorithmic work is that collision detection can be done efficiently for thousands of moving objects in real time on typical personal computers and game consoles. = A priori pruning = Where most of the objects involved are fixed, as is typical of video games, a priori methods using precomputation can be used to speed up execution. Pruning is also desirable here, both n-body pruning and pairwise pruning, but the algorithms must take time and the types of motions used in the underlying physical system into consideration. When it comes to the exact pairwise collision detection, this is highly trajectory dependent, and one almost has to use a numerical root-finding algorithm to compute the instant of impact. As an example, consider two triangles moving in time {v_1(t),v_2(t),v_3(t)} and {v_4(t),v_5(t),v_6(t)}. At any point in time, the two triangles can be checked for intersection using the twenty planes previously mentioned. However, we can do better, since these twenty planes can all be tracked in time. If P(u,v,w) is the plane going through points u,v,w in \\\\mathbb R^3 then there are twenty planes P(v_i(t),v_j(t),v_k(t)) to track. Each plane needs to be tracked against three vertices, this gives sixty values to track. Using a root finder on these sixty functions produces the exact collision times for the two given triangles and the two given trajectory. We note here that if the trajectories of the vertices are assumed to be linear polynomials in t then the final sixty functions are in fact cubic polynomials, and in this exceptional case, it is possible to locate the exact collision time using the formula for the roots of the cubic. Some numerical analysts suggest that using the formula for the roots of the cubic is not as numerically stable as using a root finder for polynomials. = Spatial partitioning = Alternative algorithms are grouped under the spatial partitioning umbrella, which includes octrees, binary space partitioning (or BSP trees) and other, similar approaches. If one splits space into a number of simple cells, and if two objects can be shown not to be in the same cell, then they need not be checked for intersection. Since BSP trees can be precomputed, that approach is well suited to handling walls and fixed obstacles in games. These algorithms are generally older than the algorithms described above. =Bounding boxes= Bounding boxes (or bounding volumes) are most often a 2D rectangle or 3D cuboid, but other shapes are possible. A bounding box in a video game is sometimes called a Hitbox. The bounding diamond, the minimum bounding parallelogram, the convex hull, the bounding circle or bounding ball, and the bounding ellipse have all been tried, but bounding boxes remain the most popular due to their simplicity. Bounding boxes are typically used in the early (pruning) stage of collision detection, so that only objects with overlapping bounding boxes need be compared in detail. = Triangle centroid segments = A triangle mesh object is commonly used in 3D body modeling. Normally the collision function is a triangle to triangle intercept or a bounding shape associated with the mesh. A triangle centroid is a center of mass location such that it would balance on a pencil tip. The simulation need only add a centroid dimension to the physics parameters. Given centroid points in both object and target it is possible to define the line segment connecting these two points. The position vector of the centroid of a triangle is the average of the position vectors of its vertices. So if its vertices have Cartesian coordinates (x_1,y_1,z_1), (x_2,y_2,z_2) and (x_3,y_3,z_3) then the centroid is \\\\left(\\\\frac{(x_1+x_2+x_3)}{3},\\\\frac{(y_1+y_2+y_3)}{3},\\\\frac{(z_1+z_2+z_3)}{3}\\\\right). Here is the function for a line segment distance between two 3D points. \\\\mathrm{distance} = \\\\sqrt{(z_2 - z_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} Here the length/distance of the segment is an adjustable \\"hit\\" criteria size of segment. As the objects approach the length decreases to the threshold value. A triangle sphere becomes the effective geometry test. A sphere centered at the centroid can be sized to encompass all the triangle's vertices.  Video games  Video games have to split their very limited computing time between several tasks. Despite this resource limit, and the use of relatively primitive collision detection algorithms, programmers have been able to create believable, if inexact, systems for use in games . For a long time, video games had a very limited number of objects to treat, and so checking all pairs was not a problem. In two-dimensional games, in some cases, the hardware was able to efficiently detect and report overlapping pixels between sprites on the screen. In other cases, simply tiling the screen and binding each sprite into the tiles it overlaps provides sufficient pruning, and for pairwise checks, bounding rectangles or circles called hitboxes are used and deemed sufficiently accurate. Three-dimensional games have used spatial partitioning methods for n-body pruning, and for a long time used one or a few spheres per actual 3D object for pairwise checks. Exact checks are very rare, except in games attempting to simulate reality closely. Even then, exact checks are not necessarily used in all cases. Because games do not need to mimic actual physics, stability is not as much of an issue. Almost all games use a posteriori collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules. For instance, if a character becomes embedded in a wall, they might be simply moved back to their last known good location. Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow them to move that far. In many cases for video games, approximating the characters by a point is sufficient for the purpose of collision detection with the environment. In this case, binary space partitioning trees provide a viable, efficient and simple algorithm for checking if a point is embedded in the scenery or not. Such a data structure can also be used to handle \\"resting position\\" situation gracefully when a character is running along the ground. Collisions between characters, and collisions with projectiles and hazards, are treated separately. A robust simulator is one that will react to any input in a reasonable way. For instance, if we imagine a high speed racecar video game, from one simulation step to the next, it is conceivable that the cars would advance a substantial distance along the race track. If there is a shallow obstacle on the track (such as a brick wall), it is not entirely unlikely that the car will completely leap over it, and this is very undesirable. In other instances, the \\"fixing\\" that posteriori algorithms require isn't implemented correctly, and characters find themselves embedded in walls, or falling off into a deep void, sometimes referred to as \\"black hell\\", \\"blue hell\\", or \\"green hell\\", depending on the predominant color. These are the hallmarks of a failing collision detection and physical simulation system. Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is an infamous example of a game with a collision detection system failing, or not being present at all. =Hitbox= debug dialogue box in Gearheads controlling an object's hitbox The hitbox of a Gearheads toy, controlled by the above screen A hitbox is an invisible shape commonly used in video games for real- time collision detection; it is a type of bounding box. It is often a rectangle (in 2D games) or cuboid (in 3D) that is attached to and follows a point on a visible object (such as a model or a sprite). Circular or spheroidial shapes are also common, though they are still most often called \\"boxes\\". It is common for animated objects to have hitboxes attached to each moving part to ensure accuracy during motion. Hitboxes are used to detect \\"one-way\\" collisions such as a character being hit by a punch or a bullet. They are unsuitable for the detection of collisions with feedback (e.g. bumping into a wall) due to the difficulty experienced by both humans and AI in managing a hitbox's ever-changing locations; these sorts of collisions are typically handled with much simpler axis-aligned bounding boxes instead. Players may use the term \\"hitbox\\" to refer to these types of interactions regardless. A hurtbox is a related term, used to differentiate \\"object that deals damage\\" from \\"object that receives damage\\". For example, an attack may only land if the hitbox around an attacker's punch connects with one of the opponent's hurtboxes on their body, while opposing hitboxes colliding may result in the players trading or cancelling blows, and opposing hurtboxes do not interact with each other. The term is not standardized across the industry; some games reverse their definitions of \\"hitbox\\" and \\"hurtbox\\", while others only use \\"hitbox\\" for both sides.

Biography  = Early life = Shneur Zalman was born in 1745 in the small town of Liozna, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Belarus). He was the son of Baruch,Lubavitcher Rabbi's memoirs: The memoirs of Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn 1971 \\"Judah Loewe, as follows: Rabbi Judah ‚Äî Betzalel ‚Äî Samuel ‚Äî Judah Leib ‚Äî Moses of Posen ‚Äî Shneur Zalman ‚Äî Baruch ‚Äî Shneur Zalman of Liady \\" great5-grandson of the mystic and philosopher Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the \\"Maharal of Prague\\".Hayom Yom, introduction [According to Jewish tradition, the Maharal's family descended patrilineally from the Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the geonim) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty.See The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David, by Chaim Freedman, published in Avotaynu Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006 He was a prominent (and the youngest) disciple of Dov Ber of Mezeritch, the \\"Great Maggid\\", who was in turn the successor of the founder of Hasidic Judaism, Yisrael ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov. thumb He displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was eight years old, he wrote an all-inclusive commentary on the Torah based on the works of Rashi, Nahmanides and Abraham ibn Ezra.'Sipurie Chassidim Lenoar' Kfar Chabad 1984 Until the age of twelve, he studied under Issachar Ber in Lyubavichi (Lubavitch); he distinguished himself as a Talmudist, such that his teacher sent him back home, informing his father that the boy could continue his studies without the aid of a teacher.The Lubavitcher Rebbe's Memoirs, vol 1. At the age of twelve, he delivered a discourse concerning the complicated laws of Kiddush Hachodesh, to which the people of the town granted him the title \\"Rav\\".Hayom Yom, 7 of Shvat At age fifteen he married Sterna Segal, the daughter of Yehuda Leib Segal, a wealthy resident of Vitebsk, and he was then able to devote himself entirely to study. During these years, Shneur Zalman was introduced to mathematics, geometry and astronomy by two learned brothers, refugees from Bohemia, who had settled in Liozna. One of them was also a scholar of the Kabbalah. Thus, besides mastering rabbinic literature, he also acquired a fair knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and Kabbalah. He became an adept in Isaac Luria's system of Kabbalah, and in 1764 he became a disciple of Dov Ber of Mezeritch. In 1767, at the age of 22, he was appointed maggid of Liozna, a position he held until 1801. =Misnagdim= In the course of the Hasidic movement's establishment, opponents (Misnagdim) arose among the local Jewish community. Disagreements between Hasidim and their opponents included debates concerning knives used by butchers for Shechita, the phrasing of prayers among others.See The Hasidic Movement and the Gaon of Vilna by Elijah Judah Schochet. For a full treatment of this subject see The Great Maggid by Jacob Immanuel Schochet, 3rd ed. 1990, ch. X, . Shneur Zalman and a fellow Hasidic leader, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk (or, according to the tradition in the Soloveitchik family, Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev), attempted to persuade the leader of Lithuanian Jewry, the Vilna Gaon, of the legitimacy of Hasidic practices. However, the Gaon refused to meet with them.An Encounter with the Alter Rebbe - Program One Hundred Sixty Eight - Living Torah = Children and succession = Shneur Zalman's sons were: Dovber Schneuri who eventually succeeded him, Chaim Avraham, and Moshe. Shneur Zalman's daughters were named Freida, Devorah Leah and Rochel. Other families have lore telling that they are also descendants, but they are undocumented in existing family records.  Dovber Shneuri  Dovber Schneuri succeeded his father as Rebbe of the Chabad movement. At the age of 39, while studying in the city of Kremenchug, Shneur Zalman died.Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Schneuri, Dovber. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. Shneuri then moved to the small border-town of Lubavichi, from which the movement would take its name. His accession was disputed by one of his father's prime students, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye, however the majority of Shneur Zalman's followers stayed with Schneuri, and moved to Lubavichi. Thus Chabad had now split into two branches, each taking the name of their location to differentiate themselves from each other. He established a Yeshivah in Lubavitch, which attracted gifted young scholars. His son-in-law, Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch, headed the Yeshivah, and later became his successor. Thus, while Schneuri succeeded his father as Rebbe of the Chabad movement, a senior disciple of his father, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye, a popular and respected figure, differed with him on a number of issues and led a breakaway movement.  Strashelye  When Schneur Zalman died, many of his followers flocked to one of his top students, Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye. He had been Shneur Zalman's closest disciple for over thirty years. While many more became followers of Dovber Shneuri, the Strashelye school of Chassidic thought was the subject of many of Dovber's discourses. Aharon HaLevi emphasized the importance of basic emotions in divine service (especially the service of prayer). Dovber Shneuri did not reject the role of emotion in prayer, but emphasized that if the emotion in prayer is to be genuine, it can only be a result of contemplation and understanding (hisbonenus) of the explanations of Chassidus, which in turn will lead to an attainment of \\"bittul\\" (self-nullification before the Divine). In his work entitled Kuntres Hispa'alus (\\"Tract on Ecstasy\\"), Dovber Shneuri argues that only through ridding oneself of what he considered disingenuous emotions could one attain the ultimate level in Chassidic worship (that is, bittul).Ehrlich, Leadership in the CHaBaD Movement, pp. 160‚Äì192, esp. pp. 167‚Äì172.  Moshe Schneersohn  Moshe Schneersohn (born c. 1784 - died, before 1853) was the youngest son of Shneur Zalman. According to scholars he converted to Catholicism and died in a St. Petersburg asylum. Chabad sources say that his conversion and related documents were faked by the Church, but Belarusian State archives in Minsk uncovered by historian Shaul Stampfer support the conversion. = Lithuania = During the latter portion of Dovber's life, his students dispersed over Europe, and after Dovber's death, Shneur Zalman became the leader of Hasidism in Lithuania, along with his senior colleague Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk. When Menachem Mendel died (in 1788), Shneur Zalman was recognized as leader of the Chassidim in Lithuania.‚ÄúShneor Zalman Ben Baruch‚Äù. jewishencyclopedia.com. At the time Lithuania was the center of the misnagdim (opponents of Hasidism), and Shneur Zalman faced much opposition. In 1774 he and Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk traveled to Vilna in an attempt to create a dialogue with the Vilna Gaon who led the Misnagdim and had issued a ban (cherem) against the Hasidim, but the Gaon refused to see them (see Vilna Gaon: Antagonism to Hasidism and Hasidim and Mitnagdim). Undaunted by this antagonism, he succeeded in creating a large network of Hasidic centers. He also joined opposition to Napoleon's advance on Russia by recruiting his disciples to the Czar's army.Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, Rabbi Nissan Mindel, New York: Kehot, 1973, pp. 251‚Äì252 He was also active in canvassing financial support for the Jewish settlements in the Land of Israel, then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. = Philosophy: Chabad = :See Hasidic philosophy As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In his seminal work, Tanya, he defines his approach as \\"\\" (\\"mind ruling over the heart/emotions\\"). He chose the name \\"Chabad\\" for this philosophy‚Äîthe Hebrew acronym for the intellectual attributes (sefirot) Chochma (\\"wisdom\\"), Bina (\\"understanding\\"), and Da'at (\\"knowledge‚Äù). According to Shneur Zalman, a man is neither a static nor a passive entity. He is a dynamic being who must work to develop his potential talent and perfect himself.The World of Hassidism, H. Rabinowicz p.74, Hartmore House 1970 Both in his works and in his sermons he \\"indicated an intelligent and not a blind faith\\", and assumed an intellectual accessibility of the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah. This intellectual basis differentiates Chabad from other forms of Hasidism - in this context referred to as \\"Chagas\\"‚Äîthe \\"emotional\\" attributes (sefirot) of Chesed (\\"kindness\\"), Gevurah (\\"power\\"), and Tiferes (\\"beauty\\"). As Shneur Zalman, founder of the Chabad intellectual school in Hasidism, shared the same Hebrew birthday (18th of Ellul, some 47 years apart) with the Baal Shem Tov, founder of the whole Hasidic movement, Habad tradition identifies them symbolically with the 2 Great Luminaries of the 4th day of Creation (Genesis 1:16: \\"And God made the two great luminaries: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night\\". In Rabbinic esoteric midrash, the sun and moon were originally created equal (\\"2 Great Lights\\"), the moon only later losing its light (\\"the lesser\\"). Accordingly, as the \\"2 Great Luminaries\\" of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov corresponds to the sun, Shneur Zalman to the moon before it was diminished. The Baal Shem Tov revealed infinite divine faith, Shneur Zalman drew the faith of Hasidic thought down into intellectual grasp.Audio recording talk, \\"the Beginning of the End\\" of the Jewish year, by Yitzchak Ginsburgh, explaining the Kabbalistic meaning of 18th Ellul. Ginsburgh connects the 2 later descending revelations of the Baal Shem Tov and Shneur Zalman on 18th Ellul, with the earlier ascending light of the Maharal who died on that day, 18th Ellul 1609. The Maharal taught a Kabbalistic philosophy of Divine paradox, later revealed and explicated by the Baal Shem Tov and Shneur Zalman In Likkutei Sichos talks, the 7th Rebbe equates the Hasidic Rebbes followed in Chabad with different Sephirot divine manifestations: the Baal Shem Tov with Keter infinite faith, Shneur Zalman with Chokhmah wisdom, the 2nd Chabad Rebbe with Binah understanding, etc. = Opposition to Napoleon and support for the Tsar = The French retreat from Moscow Kozienice Synagogue in Poland. Some Polish Hasidic leaders supported Napoleon Petropavlovski fortress in St. Petersburg During the French invasion of Russia, while many Polish Hasidic leaders supported Napoleon or remained quiet about their support, Shneur Zalman openly and vigorously supported the Tsar. While fleeing from the advancing French army he wrote a letter explaining his opposition to Napoleon to a friend, Moshe Meizeles:Should Napoleon be victorious...\\": Politics and Spirituality in Early Modern Jewish Messianism, Hillel Levine, Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 16‚Äì17, 2001 Some argue that Shneur Zalman's opposition stemmed from Napoleon's attempts to arouse a messianic view of himself in Jews, opening the gates of the ghettos and emancipating their residents as he conquered. He established an ersatz Sanhedrin, recruiting Jews to his ranks, and spreading rumors about his conquest of the Holy Land to make Jews subversive for his own ends.Napoleon and the Jews, Kobler, F., New York, 1976. Thus, his opposition was based on a practical fear of Jews turning to the false messianism of Napoleon as he saw it. Yisroel Hopsztajn of Kozienice, another Hasidic leader, also considered Napoleon a menace to the Jewish people,A. Marcus, HaChasiduth, p. 114. but believed that after victory over Russia, Messiah will arrive. Menachem Mendel Schneerson identifies Hopsztajn as the Chasidic leader who preferred that Napoleon defeat the Czar.Igros Kodesh, Vol. 15, p. 450. = Arrests = In 1797 following the death of the Gaon, leaders of the Vilna community accused the Hasidim of subversive activities - on charges of supporting the Ottoman Empire, since Shneur Zalman advocated sending charity to support Jews living in the Ottoman territory of Palestine. In 1798 he was arrested on suspicion of treason and brought to St. Petersburg where he was held in the Petropavlovski fortress for 53 days, at which time he was subjected to an examination by a secret commission. Ultimately he was released by order of Paul I of Russia. The Hebrew day of his acquittal and release, 19 Kislev, 5559 on the Hebrew calendar, is celebrated annually by Chabad Hasidim, who hold a festive meal and make communal pledges to learn the whole of the Talmud; this practice is known as \\"Chalukat HaShas\\". In Chabad tradition, his imprisonment is interpreted as a reflection of accusations in Heaven that he was revealing his new dimensions of mystical teachings too widely. The traditional tendency to conceal Jewish mysticism is founded on the Kabbalistic notion of the Sephirot. The side of Divine Chesed seeks to give physical and spiritual blessing without restriction. This is counterbalanced by the side of Gevurah, which measures and restricts the flow to the capacity and merit of the recipient. The subsequent Sephirah of Hod implements any restriction in order to preserve the glory of the Divine majesty. In the Hasidic story of an earlier episode among the \\"Holy Society\\" disciples of Dov Ber of Mezeritch, one of the great followers saw a page of Hasidic writings blowing around the courtyard. He regretted the undue dissemination of Hasidut for its desecration of Divine holiness. In the account, his vocalisation of these thoughts caused a Heavenly accusation against the Maggid, for revealing too much. The young Schneur Zalman replied with a famous Hasidic parable:The Great Maggid by Jacob Immanuel Schochet. Kehot Publications > A king had an only son who became ill and all the attending doctors were at > a loss of how to heal him. A wise person understood the only possible cure. > He told the king that he would have to desecrate the royal crown by removing > its most precious jewel. This would have to be ground up and fed to the > king's son. The king regretted the loss to his majesty but immediately > agreed that the life of his son was more important. The jewel was ground and > the solution was fed to the son. Most of the cure fell to the ground, but > the son received a few drops and became cured. Concluded Schneur Zalman in > defence of Hasidic dissemination, the king represents God, and the son > represents the Jewish community, who recognise the \\"God of Israel\\". At the > time of the emerging Hasidic movement, the Jewish people were at a physical > and spiritual low ebb. The only cure would be the dissemination of the inner > Divine teachings of Hasidic thought. Even though this would also involve > their desecration, this would fully be justified in order to heal the > people. The accusing student of the Maggid realised the wisdom of this, and > agreed with Schneur Zalman. When the Maggid heard about this, he told > Schneur Zalman that \\"you have saved me from the Heavenly accusation\\". The story of this parable is famous across other Hasidic dynasties as well. Chabad commentary asks about this the question of why a new Heavenly accusation would have arisen against Shneur Zalman himself, and result in his incarceration in St. Petersburg. Had he not already received the Heavenly agreement to the wisdom of disseminating Chassidic teachings? Since Chabad thought presented Hasidic thought with a new degree of elucidation in intellectual form, this caused a new, more severe Heavenly accusation to emerge. This went beyond the justified spiritual revival and healing of mainstream Hasidism. Here, in Hasidic thought, Schneur Zalman was seeking to fulfill the Messianic impulse to disseminate Hasidic philosophy as a preparation for Mashiach. Therefore, his subsequent exoneration by the Tzarist authorities is interpreted in Chabad as a new Heavenly agreement to begin the fullest dissemination of Hasidic thought without its prior limitations. Chabad tradition tells that in prison, Schneur Zalman was visited by the deceased Baal Shem Tov and Maggid of Mezeritch, who told him the reason for his imprisonment. In reply to the question of whether he should stop, they replied that once released, he should continue with even more dedication. Therefore, in Chabad thought, the 19th day of Kislev is called the \\"New Year of Hasidut\\", complementing the other 4 Halachic \\"New Year\\" dates in the Hebrew calendar. In 1800 Rav Shneur Zalman was again arrested and transported to St. Petersburg, this time along with his son Moshe who served as interpreter, as his father spoke no Russian or French. He was released after several weeks but banned from leaving St. Petersburg.On learning Chassidus, Brooklyn, 1959, p. 24 The accession of Tsar Alexander I (Alexander I of Russia) to the throne,a few weeks later, led to his release; he was then ‚Äúgiven full liberty to proclaim his religious teachings‚Äù by the Russian government. According to some, his first arrest was not the result of anti-Hasidic agitators fabricating charges, or officials seeking extortion monies.Kerem Chabad, Kfar Chabad, 1992, pp. 17‚Äì21, 29‚Äì31 (Documents from the Prosecutor General's archive in St. Petersburg An accusation was made on May 8, 1798 by Hirsh ben David of Vilna accused him of trying to assist the French Revolution, by sending money to Napoleon and the Sultan. Since this Hirsch ben David was untraceable, some were led to believe that there was no such person as Hirsh and the authorities were attempting to stir up internecine fighting among the Jews. = Liadi = Ohel His grave in Hadiach After his release he moved his base to Liadi, Vitebsk Region, Imperial Russia; rather than returning to Liozna. He took up his residence in the town of Liadi at the invitation of Polish Prince Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski, voivode of the town, were Zalman settled for the next 12 years. His movement grew there immensely, and to this day he is associated with the town. In 1812, fleeing the French Invasion, he left Mogilev, intending to go to Poltava, but died on the way in the small village of Pena, Kursk Oblast. He is buried in Hadiach. = Subsequent history of Chabad = :See Chabad#History Dovber Schneuri moved the movement to the town of Lubavitch (Lyubavichi) in present-day Russia. A top follower of Shneur Zalman, Aharon HaLevi Horowitz, established a rival Chabad school in Strashelye, which did not last after his death. In 1940, under the leadership of the previous Rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement moved its headquarters to Brooklyn, New York in the United States. Under the leadership of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Chabad established branches all over the world staffed by its own Lubavitch-trained and ordained rabbis with their wives and children. The number of branches continues to grow to this day, and existing branches continue to expand. Many descendants of Shneur Zalman carry surnames such as Shneur, Shneuri, Schneerson, and Zalman.  Works  The Tanya, a classic text of Hasidic philosophy Shneur Zalman was a prolific writer. He produced works of both mysticism and Jewish law. Chabad tradition recasts his Yiddish name \\"Shneur\\" (◊©◊†◊ô◊ê◊ï◊®) as the two Hebrew words \\"Shnei Ohr\\" (◊©◊†◊ô ◊ê◊ï◊®- Two Lights), referring to Schneur Zalman's mastery of both the outer dimensions of Talmudic Jewish study, and the inner dimensions of Jewish mysticism. His works form the cornerstone of Chabad philosophy. His ability to explain even the most complex issues of Torah made his writings popular with Torah scholars everywhere. = Tanya = He is probably best known for his systematic exposition of Hasidic Jewish philosophy, entitled Likkutei Amarim, more widely known as the Tanya, said to be first published in 1797. The legendary 1797 Tanya got lost in a fire and no copies survived. The extant version of this work dates from 1814. Due to the popularity of this book, Hasidic Jews often refer to Shneur Zalman as the Baal HaTanya (lit. \\"Master of the Tanya\\"). The Tanya deals with Jewish spirituality and psychology from a Kabbalistic point of view, and philosophically expounds on such themes as the Oneness of God, Tzimtzum, the Sefirot, simcha, bitachon (confidence), among many other mystical concepts. = Shulchan Aruch HaRav = 1875 edition of the Shulchan Aruch HaRav Shneur Zalman is well known for the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a collection of authoritative codes of Jewish laws and customs commissioned by Dovber of Mezeritch and composed at the legendary age of twenty-one. The Maggid of Mezeritch sought a new version of the classic Shulkhan Arukh for the Hasidic movement. The work states a selection of decided halakha, as well as the underlying reasoning, and common Hasidic customs. The Shulchan Aruch HaRav is considered authoritative by other Hasidim, and citations to this work are many times found in non-Hasidic sources such as the Mishnah Berurah used by Lithuanian Jews and the Ben Ish Chai used by Sephardic Jews. Shneur Zalman is also one of three halachic authorities on whom Shlomo Ganzfried based his Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh (Concise version of Jewish law). = Siddur = He also edited the first Chabad siddur, based on the Ari Siddur of the famous kabbalist Isaac Luria of Safed, but he altered it for general use, and corrected its textual errors. Today's Siddur Tehillat HaShem is a later print of Shneur Zalman's Siddur. = Music = Shneur Zalman composed a number of Hassidic melodies. Some accompany certain prayers, others are sung to Biblical verses or are melodies without words. Depending on the tune they are meant to arouse joy, spiritual ecstasy or teshuvah. One special melody, commonly referred to as The Alter Rebbe's Niggun or Dalet Bovos, is reserved by Chabad Hassidim for ushering a groom and bride to their wedding canopy and other select occasions. = Other = Shneur Zalman's other works include: * Torah Or and Likutei Torah, chassidic explanations of the weekly Torah portions, Shir HaShirim and the Book of Esther, drawn from his Hasidic Discourses and published by his grandson, the Tzemach Tzedek, who added his own glosses. * Sefer HaMa'amarim, also known as Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Hassidic Discourses: Hanachot HaRaP; Et‚Äôhaleich Lyozna; 5562- 2 vol.; 5563, 2 vol.; 5564; 5565, 2 vol.; 5566; 5567; 5568, 2 vol.; 5569; 5570; 5571; Haketzarim; Al Parshiyot HaTorah VehaMoadim, 2 vol.; Inyanim; Ma‚Äôamarei Razal; Nach, 3 vol. * Hilchot Talmud Torah, on the study of Torah. * Sefer She‚Äôelot Uteshuvot, Responsa. * Siddur Im Dach, a prayerbook with Hasidic discourses * Boneh Yerushalayim. * Me'ah She'arim. * Igrot Kodesh, 2 vol.

It stars Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn and Willem Dafoe. The plot is about Wade Whitehouse, a small-town policeman in New Hampshire. Detached from the people around him, including a dominating father and a divorced wife, he becomes obsessed with the solving of a fatal hunting accident, leading to a series of tragic events. Plot The film begins with a voice-over narration by Rolfe Whitehouse, announcing the story of his brother Wade's \\"strange criminal behavior\\" and subsequent disappearance. Wade Whitehouse is a small- town policeman in New Hampshire. On Halloween night, Wade meets his daughter Jill, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother, Wade's ex-wife, to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her lover against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter. The next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. Jack Hewitt, a local hunting guide, claims that Evan Twombley, with whom he was hunting, accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man's death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction. A while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade's father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from hypothermia. Glen reacts to her death with little surprise, and later gets drunk at her wake and gets into a fight with Wade. Rolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade's murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town Selectman Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a conspiracy. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off. Finally, Wade is fired for harassing Jack and trashing Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex- wife furiously castigates his plans to sue for full custody. At a local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay, but Jill rushes up and tries to push Wade away. In response, Wade pushes Jill, giving her a bloody nose. She and Margie drive off. Wade is then approached by Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a \\"real man\\". The latent aggression between the men culminates in a fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father. He burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking. Rolfe's narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack's truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere, but having nothing to do with either Jack or Twombley. Rolfe concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.

After he finished reading the book, Schrader bought the film rights from Russell Banks. The director said in an interview with Filmmaker that he identified with the characters in the story: \\"I had a very strong father and an older male sibling. My father was not abusive, he was not alcoholic, but there were enough similarities. I came from that part of the country with long cold winters, so I knew these people, and I knew their violence.\\" Although it has been compared to his previous films (e.g. Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Light Sleeper), Schrader has stated that the ending of Affliction was what made it different from them: \\"One of the differences between things that I have written and Russell's book is that I tend to end my pieces on a kind of grace note, and this one has none. I like some sense of moral grace. But Affliction is pretty bleak at the end.\\" He also added, \\"I view the film as a collaboration between myself and Russell Banks.\\" Nick Nolte was Schrader's first choice for the role of Wade Whitehouse. Schrader told Charlie Rose that he envisioned Nolte in his mind while he was writing the script. According to Schrader, he offered Nolte the part five years before filming began, when the actor had become a bankable star following his success with the box office hits The Prince of Tides and Cape Fear, both released in 1991. Although Nolte was interested in playing Wade, Schrader could not afford him at first. It was not until five years later when Nolte agreed to do Affliction for less money. However, Nolte claims he initially turned it down because he was working on other projects at the time and that he was not ready to portray the role. It was Nolte who brought Affliction to the attention of Bart Potter, the head of Largo Entertainment. Nolte told Rose that by the time the five years passed by, \\"I think I understood Wade better.\\" Schrader also admitted that the five years of preparation helped Nolte's performance. In addition to acting in the film, Nolte also served as one of its executive producers. Nolte claims that he was the one who convinced Sissy Spacek, whom he worked with in Heart Beat (1980), to appear in Affliction alongside him. According to Schrader, it was Spacek's husband Jack Fisk who came up with the idea of having the characters of Wade and Glen Whitehouse lick salt off their hands to show how similar the father and son are to each other. Schrader told Roger Ebert that he gave the part of Glen to James Coburn because he was bigger than and could \\"convincingly dominate\\" Nolte. When Schrader encouraged the actor to prepare for the role, Coburn reportedly said in response, \\"Oh, you mean you want me to really act? I can do that. I haven't often been asked to, but I can.\\" Schrader claimed that Willem Dafoe wanted to play the part of Wade. Dafoe himself would admit, \\"I knew I couldn't play Wade Whitehouse whether Nick Nolte was around or not.\\" Schrader instead offered Dafoe the role of Rolfe Whitehouse, and the latter accepted it because he loved the novel. According to Dafoe, Schrader showed him the novel during the making of Light Sleeper. Affliction was filmed in Quebec, with principal shooting ending in February 1997. Although first presented at the Venice Film Festival on August 28 the same year, Affliction did not see a theatrical release until some time later in most countries. After a limited release in New York in December 1998, it saw its regular US release in January 1999.Affliction production slate in American Cinematographer magazine, November 1998, retrieved 2012-1-2.Affliction in the Internet Movie Database. Reception The film received mostly positive reviews with an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 stars. Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote \\"[Nick Nolte] gives the performance of his career in Paul Schrader's quietly stunning new film [...] Like The Sweet Hereafter, a more meditative and elegant but less immediate, volcanic film, Affliction finds the deeper meaning in an all too believable tragedy.\\" In a negative review in the Time Out Film Guild, Geoff Andrew called the film a \\"sensitive but rather dull adaption of Russell Banks' novel [...] the narrative's too unfocused and low- key really to engage the heart or mind.\\" Awards James Coburn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. Nick Nolte was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama, the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead, and the Satellite Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture. He was awarded the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, the Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Actor, and the Valladolid International Film Festival Award for Best Actor.

The procedure constructs paths from the eye to a light source using bidirectional path tracing, then constructs slight modifications to the path. Some careful statistical calculation (the Metropolis algorithm) is used to compute the appropriate distribution of brightness over the image. This procedure has the advantage, relative to bidirectional path tracing, that once a path has been found from light to eye, the algorithm can then explore nearby paths; thus difficult-to-find light paths can be explored more thoroughly with the same number of simulated photons. In short, the algorithm generates a path and stores the path's 'nodes' in a list. It can then modify the path by adding extra nodes and creating a new light path. While creating this new path, the algorithm decides how many new 'nodes' to add and whether or not these new nodes will actually create a new path. Metropolis light transport is an unbiased method that, in some cases (but not always), converges to a solution of the rendering equation faster than other unbiased algorithms such as path tracing or bidirectional path tracing.

Kenealy, This Great Calamity, p. 342. and became a rallying point for various nationalist movements. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as \\"pre-Famine\\". Political and cultural impact =In Ireland= Political reaction resulting from the Great Irish Famine was muted, because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time. Irish politics in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the Catholic Emancipation and \\"Repeal\\" movements under Daniel O'Connell. (The Independent Irish Party, formed in June 1852, disintegrated within four years, but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices.) Outside the mainstream, too, reaction was slow. The 1848 Young Ireland rebellion under Thomas Davis, though occurring at the start of the Famine, was hardly impacted upon by the Famine, as much as by the clash between the \\"constitutional\\" nationalism and Catholicism of O'Connell and the pluralist republicanism of Davis. Another rebellion would not occur again until the 1860s under the Fenians/Irish Republican Brotherhood. Historians have speculated that, such was the economic and social impact on Ireland, the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards; in other words, that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s. Though its electorate was a small part of the population (as elsewhere in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), those Irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major British political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals, with more votes and seats going to the latter, even though it had been the party of government during the Famine. The introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 enabled the Home Rule League to largely replace the Liberals in Irish politics in 1874. The Home Rule League was reconstituted as the Irish Parliamentary Party, under Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s; Parnell was also instrumental in establishing the Irish Land League, to achieve land reform. A large body of voters continued to vote for unionists, who wished to maintain the Union that joined Britain and Ireland. The British Royal Family avoided some censure, due to their perceived impotence in political affairs. Although some believed the myth that Queen Victoria (known in Ireland in later decades as the \\"Famine Queen\\") had only donated a miserly ¬£5 to famine relief, in fact the sum was ¬£2,000, the equivalent of ¬£61,000 today, from her personal resources. She also was patron of a charity that fundraised. On instruction of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849. However, this visit was conducted under stringent security measures and was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit just after the famine were compared to \\"illuminating a graveyard\\" in a newspaper editorial at the time.Kinealy, Christine (2000), Hidden Famine: Hunger, Poverty and Sectarianism in Belfast, p. 184 An additional social impact due to the high numbers of children orphaned was that for some young women, prostitution was one of few options available. Some of these young women became known as Wrens of the Curragh. =Linguistic consequences= It is estimated that one and a half million people died during the Famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851. A large proportion of these were Irish speakers, and the poorest districts, from which emigration continued to flow, were generally Irish-speaking.Maureen Wall, 'The Decline of the Irish Language,' p. 87, in √ì Cu√≠v, Brian (ed.) (1969), A View of the Irish Language, Irish Stationery Office. The Famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language (the general exclusion of Irish from public life and the influence of the English-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part) but it was a conspicuous element.Breand√°n √ì Madag√°in (1974, 1980), An Ghaeilge in Luimneach 1700‚Äì1900, pp. 14‚Äì22, An Cl√≥chomhar Tta, . This led to the creation of an Ireland which thought of itself as essentially English- speaking, though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the Gaelic League and the growth of a network of urban Irish-speaking activists from the late nineteenth century on. In pre-Famine Ireland Irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition. The latter persisted in the form of Irish language manuscripts containing both prose and poetry: a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature.Tom√°s de Bhaldraithe (ed.) (1970, 1973, 1976), C√≠n Lae Amhlaoibh, p. xxvii, An Cl√≥chomhar Tta, √ì Madag√°in, pp. 29‚Äì34. Many such manuscripts were taken to America by emigrants in the 1840s and after. The emigration of numerous Irish speakers to America as an immediate or long-term result of the Famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the Irish language. This was marked in part by the foundation of Philo-Celtic Societies and the founding of the monthly journal An Gaodhal in 1881, the first such publication anywhere in which Irish was extensively used.Breand√°n √ì Buachalla, ' An Gaodhal i Meirice√°,' pp. 38‚Äì56, in Stiof√°n √ì hAnnrach√°in (ed.) (1979), Go Meirice√° Siar, An Cl√≥chomhar Tta.W.H.A. Williams, 'Ceol na h√âireann agus amhr√°in na ndaoine sna St√°it Aontaithe,' pp. 68‚Äì84, in √ì hAnnrach√°in (ed.) (1979). =Irish emigrants abroad= If the political elite in Ireland remained tolerant of British political parties and the monarchy, emigrants were not so. Many Irish emigrants to the United States quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the IRB. The political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the States confirmed for them the potential of an independent Ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home. The Famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger, as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place. John Mitchel, a journalist by trade (who had written for Thomas Davis's newspaper, The Nation before leaving to set up his own paper, only to be arrested, tried for sedition and transported to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land) proved to be a superb campaigner against British rule in Ireland. Analysing the famine, he wrote: Mitchel's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants, who saw themselves as the dispossessed, forced from Ireland by a famine they blamed on British government policies. The famine became a constant issue with Irish Americans, who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the United States, remained emotionally attached to their native land. Leaders such as John Devoy in later decades came to play a major role in supporting Irish independence. It was no accident that the President of D√°il √âireann, √âamon de Valera in 1920 chose to travel to the United States, not elsewhere, in his efforts to get the Irish Republic recognised and accepted, or that when Michael Collins launched special bonds to fund the new Republic, many were sold to Irish Americans. Suggestions of genocide A claim was made by a US professor of law, Francis Boyle that the Famine was genocide by the English against the Irish, meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination. One US historian, James Mullin, insists that what happened can be described as genocide, sometimes accusing other historians, statisticians, and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a British point of view, or of revisionism, rewriting history to make excuses for British imperialism.Americanchronicle.com However, professional US, British, and Irish historians, such as Professors F.S.L. Lyons, John A. Murphy, Roy Foster, and James S. Donnelly, Jr, as well as historians Cecil Woodham-Smith, Peter Gray, Ruth Dudley Edwards, and Cormac √ì Gr√°da have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the ministry of Lord John Russell) were misguided, ill-informed, and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government's response would have been very different. Debated greatly, there are public records that there was enough grain and meal in Ireland during that period to have prevented the food shortage caused by the potato blight. Famine conditions were allowed to continue for a number of years in the 1840s, while the surplus food was not distributed. There has been the assertion that because emigration was allowed, the Famine period does not qualify as genocide. The poverty, evictions, slave-like workshops where workers paid off the cost of their tickets, and the overcrowding and unhygienic conditions on emigration ships, all combined to make the journey of emigrating as great a risk as staying and trying to survive starvation. By modern definitions, the term \\"refugee\\" would be more accurate than \\"emigrant\\" to describe those who fled Ireland. Whether the British Empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million Irish people to die, or whether the government was negligent, are issues in the debate over whether that episode of Irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide. Legacy of the Famine today 1845‚Äì49 potato famine. Ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in the 1990s. It was a contrast, in many ways, with the 100th anniversary in the 1940s. Then, only a few commemorations were held ‚Äì the most significant of which was a commissioned volume of Famine history edited by R. Dudley Edwards and T. Desmond Williams (though not published until 1956), and the important 'Famine Survey' undertaken by the Irish Folklore Commission in 1945. Beyond these important cultural aspects, emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of Irish political life in the 1940s, and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims, who had died or emigrated. Some commentators were embarrassed that their ancestors had somehow fed themselves by inevitably not sharing food with the victims, a form of \\"Survivor guilt\\". The 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the Famine, as hundreds of events took place in Ireland and throughout the Irish diaspora, some of which received sponsorship from the National Famine Commemoration Committee based in the Department of the Taoiseach, led by TD Avril Doyle. At the Great Famine Event held in Millstreet, a statement from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was read aloud, apologising for the failure of past British governments to adequately address the crisis.The Guardian Blair says sorry for Britain's 'failure' in the Irish famine 2 June 1997 A large amount of new famine studies were produced, many detailing for the first time local experiences. Historians re-examined all aspects of the Famine experience; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants, to the long-term impact it had on society, sexual behaviour, land holdings, property rights and the entire Irish identity, personified in the conservatism of Cardinal Cullen, that persisted into the 1900s. In 2010 Britain failed to send a diplomatic representative to the opening of the National Famine Commemoration, while 14 other nations did. The Taoiseach and President also did not attend in person, but sent staff members.Independent.ie The Famine in song The Famine is also commemorated in song, both from the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, Brendan Graham has written a number of novels and songs on An Gorta M√≥r ‚Äì the Great Irish Famine. His book publishing deal with Harper Collins originated from a number of songs he had written about An Gorta M√≥r, resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel' of the Famine ‚Äì The Whitest Flower (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The Whitest Flower ‚Äì 'An important addition to the Irish national story'. The Whitest Flower, with its song 'soundtrack', was a required text for Boston's MIT Women's Studies Course. Along with its sequel The Element of Fire (HarperCollins, 2001), The Whitest Flower was also listed as 'support fiction' for Ireland's Leaving Certificate, History syllabus. \\"The Voice\\" written by Brendan Graham and performed by Eimear Quinn won the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest for Ireland. The lyrics refer to Ireland's troubled history and point clearly to Famine times in Ireland, I am The Voice of your hunger and pain. As well as entering the British Pop Charts, The Voice was one of the songs studied for the UK GCSE Music Syllabus, 1998. Eimear Quinn's version featured in the Pierce Brosnan movie ‚Äì The Nephew, while the song found a new life in America with the recording and widespread PBS broadcasting of it as part of the group Celtic Woman's rise to prominence there. Author and sociologist E. Moore Quinn in her book 'Irish American Folklore in New England', published in 2009, quotes the full lyric of The Voice. \\"The Fairhaired Boy\\" ‚Äì This song written by Brendan Graham was recorded by Cathy Jordan and Dervish on their 2003 album, 'Spirit'. Carmel Conway also recorded the song on her 2009 album 'This Beautiful Day'. It is also performed in the 'Cois Tine ‚Äì Stories of Liam O' Flaherty' ‚Äì by singer and violinist Fionnuala Howard. A song of emigration from Ireland during Famine times, The Fairhaired Boy tells of the sorrow of parting ‚Äì 'Soon you'll in California be or Colorado bound'. In The Whitest Flower, Graham's heroine Ellen sings the song to Roberteen, a young neighbour from Ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto (fever shed) at Canada's Quarantine Island of Grosse Ile. The song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses, the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener's interest alive. \\"Cruc√°n na bP√°iste\\" ‚Äì 'the burial place of (unbaptised) children' ‚Äì lies on a hilltop in Maamtrasna, Co.Mayo, overlooking Lough Nafooey, and Lough Mask in Ireland. It is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during Aimsir an Drochshaoil ('The Time of the Bad Life' ‚Äì the Famine). The song was written by Graham for Ellen Rua, one of the characters in his second novel, The Brightest Day, The Darkest Night, also published by Harper Collins. It has been recorded and performed by a number of artistes most notably Karen Matheson (as part of the Transatlantic Sessions), Cathy Jordan of Dervish and Eimear Quinn. Graham reveals the story of how the song came to be written in his Sunday Miscellany radio piece for RT√â, called Effin' Songs, recorded live in Ireland's National Concert Hall, with Eimear Quinn and the RT√â Concert Orchestra and piper Neil Martin, following with the song itself. \\"Cruc√°n na bP√°iste had become a claw in my gut ‚Äì and my pilgrimage. Over many months it inched out in me its cry...focal by focal...line by line...until I was set free and it had found its epiphany. I had learned to keep out of the way...let the song write itself. This, I suppose is the real answer to the question with which we started. The truly special songs write us...we don't write them; we don't find them...they find us\\". Another of Graham's Famine songs, \\"Och√≥n an Ghorta Mh√≥ir / Lament of the Great Hunger\\", was commissioned by the Irish Government, as part of the Ce√≥l Reoite (Frozen Music ‚Äì after Goethe's 'Architecture is frozen music') Millennial Project. Fourteen Irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within. Graham chose the Curvilinear Glasshouses at Dublin's National Botanic Gardens, constructed at the time of An Gorta M√≥r, by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting Ireland. The glasshouses looked down over the Gardens' 'vegetable patch', where the blight was first discovered in Ireland in August 1845. Graham has described the 'frozen music' locked within the architecture of the Curvilinear Glasshouses as 'a lament for a famished people'. A song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by R√≥is√≠n Elsafty, on the Ce√≥l Reoite album and as a 'hidden track' by Cathy Jordan on the Dervish album, Spirit. The song was also performed by Nuala N√≠ Chanainn in the 2002 production of Aistir/Voyage by the Swiss-based, Cathy Sharp Dance Ensemble. \\"You Raise Me Up\\" ‚Äì It was in fact reading Graham's novel The Whitest Flower, that led Norwegian composer, Rolf Lovland to contact Graham with a melody. This melody in turn inspired Graham to write the lyric ‚Äì You Raise Me Up, which has been recorded by some 400 artists (including Westlife, Josh Groban, Brian Kennedy and Secret Garden, Daniel O'Donnell, Helene Fischer, Il Divo, Russell Watson and Paul Potts) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history. Brendan Graham has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including Writing the Famine in Fiction and Song, for The National Famine Commemoration Week in Ireland, 2010. This was narrated by the author with songs performed by Cathy Jordan accompanied on piano by Feargal Murray. In Quebec, 2011, his shorter narrative and song piece ‚Äì From Famine to Freedom ‚Äì Ireland to Grosse Ile ‚Äì was performed by the Quebec Symphony Orchestra and soloist M√©av N√≠ Mhaolchatha, with Graham's narration translated into French. It included a first performance with orchestra of The Whitest Flower, Graham's title song for the soundtrack to his book. In response to the view handed down at the time of Ireland's Famine that \\"The judgement of God‚Ä¶sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated\\" (Charles E. Trevelyan ‚Äì Permanent Assistant Secretary at the British Treasury with prime responsibility for Famine relief in Ireland), Graham's song calls to task a vengeful God: In August 2012 Brendan Graham composed and presented From Famine to Freedom ‚Äì Ireland to Australia, a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during An Gorta M√≥r ‚Äì The Great Irish Famine ‚Äì and of those who fled the Famine to establish a new life Australia. Graham wrote a new song called, \\"Orphan Girl\\", dedicated to the memory of the 4,112, mainly teenage Irish orphan girls, who were given a free passage to Australia from Workhouses in every county of Ireland between 1848 and 1850. Brendan Graham was joined by Australian singer-songwriter, Sarah Calderwood who unites classic with contemporary folk. She is the charismatic front woman of Australia's premier Celtic group, Sunas, who released the ABC best-selling debut album ‚ÄòAs Night Falls‚Äô. Graham and Calderwood were also joined on the day by the inspirational Australian Girls Choir, who have previously performed for Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama. The commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering, especially for those who are descendants of these Irish Workhouse young women.For more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org More recently in March 2013 The Possible Dreams Choir toured Victoria in Australia, singing \\"Orphan Girl\\" (sung by Fortunate and Nomcebo) and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" as part of their Voices for the Voiceless tour. Possible Dreams International, Inc is a non-profit organisation which partners with rural and remote communities in Swaziland, Southern Africa to empower families and individuals living with extreme poverty, malnutrition and endemic disease. So in Graham's \\"Famine in Song\\" lyrics, there resonates a global reach. A famous modern song on the famine is \\"The Fields of Athenry\\", by Pete St. John. Written in three verses, it deals with a fictitious but realistic story of \\"Michael\\" being deported to Botany Bay for stealing corn to feed his starving family. Performed in folk, traditional and even reggae versions, it is often sung by supporters of Glasgow's Celtic F.C., many of whom are of Irish descent. The song itself sums up the sense of despair, anger and bitterness of famine victims. The song was also covered by Boston punk rock band, the Dropkick Murphys on their 2003 Blackout album. Rowan Gillespie's \\"Famine\\", in Ireland Park, Toronto Harbourfront Luka Bloom's song 'Forgiveness' from his album Salty Heaven is sung from the point of view of an Irish Famine refugee who has relocated to Canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness. Luka Bloom's brother Christy Moore also has a song, written by Bloom but recorded by Moore, called 'The City of Chicago,' that chronicles the effects of the Famine and the subsequent mass emigration. Pagan metal band Primordial also have a song about the Famine named \\"The Coffin Ships\\" on their 2005 album The Gathering Wilderness. Another related song is \\"Famine\\" by Sin√©ad O'Connor, released on the Universal Mother album. The lyricsUHB.fr emphasise the political aspect of the famine. Ireland and modern famine relief Ireland has been at the forefront of international famine relief. In 1985 Bob Geldof, Irish rock star and founder of Live Aid, revealed that the people of Ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world. Irish NGOs Goal, Concern, Tr√≥caire and Gorta play a central role in helping famine victims throughout Africa. In 2000, Bono, lead singer with Irish band U2, played a central role in campaigning for debt relief for African nations in the Jubilee 2000 campaign. The Irish famine experience continues to influence many Irish people in their attitudes towards the developing world and famine victims everywhere.

Schneersohn (; 21 June 1880 ‚Äì 28 January 1950) was an Orthodox rabbi and the sixth Rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch chasidic movement. He is also known as the Frierdiker Rebbe (Yiddish for \\"Previous Rebbe\\"), the Rebbe RaYYaTz, or the Rebbe Rayatz (an acronym for Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak). After many years of fighting to keep Orthodox Judaism alive from within the Soviet Union, he was forced to leave; he continued to conduct the struggle from Latvia, and then Poland, and eventually the United States, where he spent the last ten years of his life.  Early life  Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn was born in Lyubavichi, Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day Smolensk Oblast, Russia), the only son of Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn (the Rebbe Rashab), the fifth Rebbe of Chabad. He was appointed as his father's personal secretary at the age of fifteen; in that year, he represented his father in the conference of communal leaders in Kovno. The following year (1896), he participated in the Vilna Conference, where Rabbis and community leaders discussed issues such as: genuine Jewish education; permission for Jewish children not to attend public school on Shabbat; the creation of a united Jewish organization for the purpose of strengthening Judaism. He participated in this conference again in 1908.The Four Worlds, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Kehot, 2006, pp. 87‚Äì90. On 13 Elul 5657 (1897), at the age of seventeen, he married a distant cousin, Nechama Dina Schneersohn, daughter of Rabbi Avraham Schneerson of Chi»ôinƒÉu, son of Rabbi Yisroel Noach of Nizhyn, son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the Tzemach Tzedek. In 1898, he was appointed head of the Tomchei Temimim yeshiva network. In 1901, with financial support from Yaakov and Eliezer Poliakoff he opened spinning and weaving mills in Dubrovno and Mahilyow and established a Yeshiva in Bukhara.Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Schneersohn, Joseph Isaac. Naftali Lowenthal. Aronson, London 1996. As he matured, he campaigned for the rights of Jews by appearing before the Czarist authorities in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 he sought relief for Jewish conscripts in the Russian army by sending them kosher food and supplies in the Russian Far East. In 1905, he participated in organizing a fund to provide Passover needs for troops in the Far East. With rising anti-Semitism and pogroms against Jews, in 1906, he travelled with other prominent rabbis to seek help from Western European governments, especially Germany and the Netherlands, and persuaded bankers there to use their influence to stop pogroms. He was arrested four times between 1902 and 1911 by the Czarist police because of his activism, but was released each time.  Becoming Rebbe  Upon the death of his father, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn (\\"Rashab\\"), in 1920, Yosef Yitzchak became the sixth Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch. It was an age of great social and political upheaval following the Russian Revolution of 1917. The victorious anti- religious Bolsheviks were intent on uprooting and suppressing all religious life in the new Bolshevist Russia.  Battling the Bolsheviks  Following the takeover of Russia by the Communists, they created a special \\"Jewish affairs section\\" run by Jews known as the Yevsektsiya, which instigated anti-religious activities meant to strip Orthodox Jews of their religious way of life. As Rebbe of a Russia-based Jewish movement, Rabbi Schneersohn was vehemently outspoken against the atheistic Communist regime and its goal of forcibly eradicating religion throughout the land. He purposely directed his followers to set up religious schools, going against the dictates of the Marxist- Leninist \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\". In 1921, he established a branch of Tomchei Temimim in Warsaw. In 1924, he was forced by the Cheka (Russian secret police) to leave Rostov due to the Yevsektsiya's slander, and settled in Leningrad. In this time he labored to strengthen Torah observance through activities involving rabbis, Torah schools for children, yeshivot, shochtim, senior Torah-instructors and the opening of mikva'ot; he established a special committee to help manual workers be able to observe Shabbat. He established Agudas Chasidei Chabad in USA and Canada. In 1927, he established a number of yeshivot in Bukhara. He was primarily responsible for the maintenance of the now-clandestine Chabad yeshiva system, which had ten branches throughout Russia by this time. He was under continual surveillance by agents of the NKVD. = Imprisonment and release = In 1927, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Bolshoy Dom in Leningrad. He was accused of counter-revolutionary activities, and sentenced to death. A worldwide storm of outrage and pressure from Western governments and the International Red Cross forced the communist regime to commute the death sentence and instead on 3 Tammuz it banished him to Kostroma for an original sentence of three years. Yekaterina Peshkova, a prominent Russian human rights activist, helped from inside as well. This was also commuted following political pressure from the outside, and he was finally allowed to leave Russia for Riga in Latvia, where he lived from 1928 until 1929. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak's release from Soviet imprisonment is celebrated each year by the Chabad community.Schneerson, Menachem M. \\"Yud-Beis Tammuz 5738.\\" Sichos in English: 5738. Volume 1. Vaad Lehafotzas Sichos (Sichos in English). 1978. sichosinenglish.org. Accessed 28 April 2014. After his release, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak then went to the Holy Land where he saw holy gravesites, local yeshivas and Torah centers,Der Morgen Journal, 18 September 1929. and met with rabbis and community leaders from 7‚Äì22 August 1929,Der Morgen Journal, 18 September 1929. leaving just prior to the massacre by Arabs of nearly 70 Jews living in Hebron on 24 August.  1929: First visit to the United States  Following his trip to the Holy Land, he turned his attention to the United States, arriving in Manhattan on 17 September 1929 (12 Elul 5689) on the French passenger liner France.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 17 September 1929, p. 8; Forward, 18 September 1929, pp. 1, 12.

On 10 July, he met President Herbert Hoover at the White House.The Sentinel (Chicago), 25 July 1930, p. 11. As the Republican presidential candidate, Hoover had lobbied for his release. Lubavitch followers in America begged their Rebbe to leave Russia and stay in America, but Rabbi Schneersohn declined, saying that America was an irreligious place where even rabbis shaved off their beards. He left the United States to return to Riga, Latvia, on 17 July 1930.Jewish Daily Bulletin, 18 July 1930, p. 4. From 1934 until the early part of World War II, he lived in Warsaw, Poland.  1940: Settling in the United States  Following Nazi Germany's attack against Poland in 1939, Rabbi Schneersohn refused to leave Warsaw. The government of the United States of America, which was still neutral, used its diplomatic relations to convince Nazi Germany to rescue Schneersohn from the war zone in German-occupied Poland.Rigg, Bryan Mark, Rescued from the Reich: How One of Hitler's Soldiers Saved the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Yale University Press 2006) He remained in the city during the bombardments and its capitulation to Nazi Germany. He gave the full support of his organizations to assist as many Jews as possible to flee the invading armies. With the intercession of the United States Department of State in Washington, DC and with the lobbying of many Jewish leaders, such as Jacob Rutstein, on behalf of the Rebbe (and, reputedly, also with the help of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris,Altein, R, Zaklikofsky, E, Jacobson, I: \\"Out of the Inferno: The Efforts That Led to the Rescue of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn of Lubavitch from War Torn Europe in 1939‚Äì40\\", p. 160. Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, 2002 the head of the Abwehr), he was finally granted diplomatic immunity and given safe passage to go via Berlin to Riga, Latvia (where the Rebbe was a citizen and which was still free) and then on to New York City, where he arrived on 19 March 1940.See video . Major Ernst Bloch, a decorated German army officer of Jewish descent, was put in command of a group which included Sgt. Klaus Schenk, a \\"half-Jew\\" and Pvt. Johannes Hamburger, a \\"quarter-Jew\\" assigned to locate the Rebbe in Poland and escort him safely to freedom. They were a few of up to 150,000 Jews and people of Jewish descent who were classified as Mischlinge (\\"mixed-breeds\\", i.e., Germans with one or two Jewish grandparents) by the Nazi government, but served in the German armed forces during World War II.Rigg, Bryan Mark, Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story of Nazi Racial Laws and Men of Jewish Descent in the German Military (University Press of Kansas ed. 2009) They wound up saving not only the Rebbe, but also over a dozen Hasidic Jews in the Rebbe's family or associated with him. Ironically, without the rescue of Rebbe Schneersohn, the rescue of his son-in-law and the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson would not have happened. Working with the government and the contacts Schneersohn had with the US State Department, Chabad was able to save Menachem Mendel from Vichy France in 1941 before the borders were closed down.Friedman, Menachem, and Heilman, Samuel, The Rebbe: The Life and Afterlife of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Princeton, 2010; Bryan Mark Rigg, The Rabbi Saved by Hitler's Soldiers, Kansas, 2016.

Sherman, Orthodox Judaism in America: A Biographical Dictionary and Sourcebook (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1996), p. 189.) two of his chassidim came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because \\"America is different.\\" To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Rabbi Schneersohn wrote, \\"Out of my eyes came boiling tears\\", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that \\"America is no different.\\"See video . In 1949, Rabbi Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Rabbi Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to \\"770\\" to officiate at Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).The Previous Rebbe Accepts US Citizenship - Program One Hundred Twenty Eight - Living Torah. Chabad.org. 1949-03-17; \\"Out of the Inferno,\\" Reviewed by Efraim Zuroff, The Jerusalem Post, 15 December 2002; Bryan Mark Rigg, The Rabbi Saved by Hitler's Soldiers, Kansas, 2016. Following the sixth Chabad Rebbe's escape from Nazi occupied Poland and his settlement in New York City, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok issued a call for repentance, stating L'alter l'tshuva, l'alter l'geula (\\"speedy repentance brings a speedy redemption\\"). This campaign was opposed by Rabbis Avraham Kalmanowitz and Aaron Kotler of the Vaad Hatzalah. In return, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok was critical of the efforts of Rabbis Kalmanowitz and Kotler based on the suspicion that Kalmanowitz and Kotler were discriminating in their use of funds, placing their yeshivas before all else, and that the Mizrachi and Agudas Harabonim withdrew their support of the Vaad after they discovered this fact.Rigg, Bryan Mark. Rescued from the Reich. Cambridge University Press. 2005.  Launch of Lubavitch activities in the United States  During the last decade of Rabbi Schneersohn's life, from 1940 to 1950, he settled in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York City. Rabbi Schneersohn was already physically weak and ill from his suffering at the hands of the Communists and the Nazis and from multiple health issues including multiple sclerosis, but he had a strong vision of rebuilding Orthodox Judaism in America, and he wanted his movement to spearhead it. In order to do so, he went on a building campaign to establish religious Jewish day schools and yeshivas for boys and girls, women and men. He established printing houses for the voluminous writings and publications of his movement, and started the process of spreading Jewish observance to the Jewish masses worldwide. He began to teach publicly, and many came to seek out his teachings. He began gathering and sending out a small number of his newly trained rabbis to other cities - a trend later emulated and amplified by his son-in-law and successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. In 1948, he established a Lubavitch village in the Land of Israel known as Kfar Chabad near Tel Aviv, on the site of the de-populated Arab village of Al-Safiriyya. He died in 1950, and was buried at Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York City. He had no sons, and his younger son-in-law, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (\\"The Rebbe\\") succeeded him as Lubavitcher Rebbe, while the older son-in-law, Rabbi Shemaryahu Gurary continued to run the Chabad Yeshiva network Tomchei Temimim. After Rabbi Schneersohn's passing, his gravesite, known as \\"the Ohel\\", became a central point of focus for his successor Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who would visit it regularly for many hours of prayer, meditation, and supplication for Jews all over the world. After his successor's passing and burial next to his father-in-law, philanthropist Joseph Gutnick of Melbourne, Australia, established the Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch Center on Francis Lewis Boulevard in Queens, which is located adjacent to the joint grave site.  Book collection  During his life in Smolensk, Rabbi Schneersohn set up a collection of his family's religious books and writings. It includes texts dating back to the 16th century. After World War I, the Bolsheviks found part of the collection and moved it to the Russian State Library. Another part of the collection was confiscated by Soviet troops in Nazi Germany during World War II and moved to Russia's military archive. In 1994, seven books were loaned to the U.S. Library of Congress for 60 days through an inter-library exchange program. The books were given to the Chabad-Lubavitch library which helped to prolong the use of the books twice, in 1995 and 1996, before they finally refused to return them to Russia in 2000. They proposed an exchange for the opportunity to keep the books indefinitely, but Russia refused. In 2004, the Chabad- Lubavitch filed a lawsuit against Russia, claiming the remaining books. In 2010, an American court granted their claim, which Russia ignored as invalid. In retaliation, in 2011 Russia put a ban on lending works to American museums. In 2014, Senior United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth imposed fines of $50,000 a day for Russia refusing to return the Schneersohn collection of more than 12,000 books and 50,000 religious papers. Since Rabbi Schneersohn had no heirs, Russia claims the collection is a national treasure of the Russian people. This dispute is related to the deteriorating ties between Moscow and the U.S. over the ongoing 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. A Russian court ruled that the Library of Congress should pay fines of $50,000 a day for refusing to return the books.

Loosely based on Federico Fellini's film La Strada, the film tells the fictional story, set in the 1930s, of a self- confident jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (played by Sean Penn) who falls in love with a mute woman (Samantha Morton). The film also stars Uma Thurman and Anthony LaPaglia. Like several of Allen's other films (e.g., Zelig), the film is occasionally interrupted by interviews with critics and biographers like Allen, Nat Hentoff, and Douglas McGrath, who comment on the film's plot as if the characters were real-life people. The film is one of the better-received works by Allen. Penn and Morton both received Oscar nominations, for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Plot summary Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) is a jazz guitarist who achieved some acclaim in the 1930s with a handful of recordings for RCA Victor, but who faded from public view under mysterious circumstances. Though a talented musician, Ray's personal life is a shambles. He is a spendthrift, womanizer and pimp who believes that falling in love will ruin his musical career. Due to his heavy drinking, he's often late or even absent for performances with his quintet. After music, his favorite hobby is shooting rats at garbage dumps. Ray idolizes famed guitarist Django Reinhardt, and is said to have fainted in his presence and to have fled a nightclub performance with severe stage fright upon hearing a false rumor that Reinhardt was in the audience. On a double date with his drummer, Ray meets Hattie (Samantha Morton), a shy, mute laundress. After overcoming some initial frustration due to the difficulties of communication, Ray and Hattie form an affectionate and close relationship. She accompanies him on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, where he plays in a short film; Hattie is spotted by a director and enjoys a brief screen career. However Ray is convinced that a musician of his stature should never settle down with one woman. On a whim, Ray marries socialite Blanche Williams (Uma Thurman). However, Blanche sees Ray mainly as a colorful example of lower-class life and a source of inspiration for her literary writings. She reports that Ray is tormented by nightmares and shouts out Hattie's name in his sleep. When Blanche cheats with mobster Al Torrio (Anthony LaPaglia), Ray leaves her and locates Hattie. He assumes that she will take him back, but discovers that she is happily married and raising a family. Afterwards, on a date with a new woman, a despondent Ray plays a melody that Hattie adored and then smashes his guitar and forlornly repeats the phrase \\"I made a mistake!\\" as his date leaves him. Woody Allen and the rest of the documentary experts remarked that Ray's final compositions were legendary, finally reaching the quality of Reinhardt's. Cast Production Hot off his 1969 directing debut Take the Money and Run, Allen signed a contract to direct a series of films with United Artists. Told to \\"write what you want to write,\\" Allen (a clarinetist and avid jazz enthusiast) wrote The Jazz Baby, a dramatic screenplay about a jazz musician set in the 1930s. Allen said later that the United Artists executives were \\"stunned... because they had expected a comedy. [They] were very worried and told me, 'We realize that we signed a contract with you and you can do anything you want. But we want to tell you that we really don't like this.'\\"Bjorkman, Stig, ed. Woody Allen on Woody Allen: Revised Edition. London: Faber and Faber, 1995, 2004. p. 36-7. Allen went along with United Artists, writing and directing Bananas instead. In 1995, he dismissed The Jazz Baby as having been \\"probably too ambitious.\\" In 1998, Allen returned to the project, rewriting the script and dubbing it Sweet and Lowdown. In the role of Emmet Ray, a jazz guitarist whom Allen had originally planned to play himself, the director cast Sean Penn; Allen also considered Johnny Depp, but the actor was busy at the time.Bjorkman, Stig, ed. Woody Allen on Woody Allen: Revised Edition. London: Faber and Faber, 1995, 2004. p. 347-56. In regard to working with Sean Penn, who had a reputation for being difficult to work with, Allen later said, \\"I had no problem with him whatsoever... He gave it his all and took direction and made contributions himself... a tremendous actor.\\" In an October 26, 2009, appearance on Howard Stern's radio program, Rosie O'Donnell claimed that Allen offered her the role of Hattie, despite the fact that she had been vocal in her disgust over Allen's relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. When Stern asked if she were at all tempted to take the role despite her personal feelings, she replied that she was \\"not for one minute tempted.\\" The role went to Samantha Morton. Sweet and Lowdown was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Penn) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Morton). Morton's nomination was especially notable given that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film. Allen has said that he told Morton to \\"play the part like Harpo Marx. And she said, 'Who is Harpo Marx?' and I realized how young she was. Then I told her about him [and] she went back and saw the films.\\" In addition to her Oscar nomination, Morton's performance was met with critical acclaim, with Salon.com critic Stephanie Zacharek saying that she \\"quietly explodes [the film]... Her performance is like nothing I've seen in recent years.\\" Sweet and Lowdown was filmed entirely in New York and New JerseyDavis, Tom.

The film was the first of Allen's that was edited by Alisa Lepselter, who has edited all of Allen's films since. Lepselter succeeded Susan E. Morse, who edited Allen's films for the previous twenty years. It was the first of three films where Allen collaborated with Chinese cinematographer Zhao Fei. Allen had first noticed Zhao with his award-winning work on Raise the Red Lantern, some years earlier. Music The music for the film was arranged and conducted by Dick Hyman. All of the guitar solos are played by guitarist Howard Alden. Alden also coached Sean Penn on playing the guitar for his role in the film. Additional rhythm guitarists: Bucky Pizzarelli and James Chirillo -- Chirillo played rhythm guitar on the Sweet Georgia Brown track -- where the crescent moon cable breaks while Sean Penn is riding it. Pizzarelli did all other rhythm tracks. Reception Sweet and Lowdown received generally positive reviews; it currently holds a 77% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 61 reviews, with the consensus, \\"Critics praise Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown for its charming, light-hearted comedy and quality acting.\\" The film carries a 70 on Metacritic indicating generally favorable reviews.

Bardem won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the psychopathic assassin Anton Chigurh in the 2007 Coen brothers film No Country for Old Men. He has also received critical acclaim for roles in films such as Jam√≥n Jam√≥n, Carne tr√©mula, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Boca a boca, Los lunes al sol, Mar adentro, and Skyfall, for which he received both a BAFTA and a SAG nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Bardem has also won two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a BAFTA, five Goya Awards, two European Film Awards, a Prize for Best Actor at Cannes (ex-aequo with Elio Germano) and two Volpi Cups at Venice for his work. He was the first Spanish actor to be nominated for an Oscar (Best Actor, 2000, for Before Night Falls), as well as the first Spaniard to win one, for Best Supporting Actor in No Country for Old Men in 2008. In 2011, he received his third Academy Award nomination, and second Best Actor nomination, for the film Biutiful. As of January 2018, Bardem became an environmental activist with Greenpeace for protection of Antarctica.  Early life  Bardem was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands, Spain. His mother, Pilar Bardem (born Mar√≠a del Pilar Bardem Mu√±oz), is an actress, and his father, Jos√© Carlos Encinas Doussinague (1931‚Äì1995), was the son of a cattle rancher. According to Pilar's memoirs, Jos√© had a \\"capricious and violent will\\" who shot up the front door. He changed jobs more than 10 times, leading to evictions and the children going hungry. The two separated shortly after Javier's birth, and his mother raised him and his elder siblings, Carlos and M√≥nica, alone. (Another sibling died shortly after birth.) His father died of leukemia in 1995. Bardem comes from a long line of filmmakers and actors dating back to the earliest days of Spanish cinema; he is a grandson of actors Rafael Bardem and Matilde Mu√±oz Sampedro, and a nephew of screenwriter and director Juan Antonio Bardem. Both siblings are actors. He also comes from a political background, as his uncle Juan Antonio was imprisoned by Franco for his anti-fascist films. Bardem was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith by his grandmother. As a child, he spent time at theatres and on film sets. At age six, he made his first film appearance, in Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez's El P√≠caro (The Scoundrel). He also played rugby for the junior Spanish National Team. Though he grew up in a family full of actors, Bardem did not see himself going into the family business. Actually, painting was his first love. He went on to study painting for four years at Madrid's Escuela de Artes y Oficios. In need of money he took acting jobs to support his painting, but he also says he was a bad painter and eventually abandoned that career pursuit. In 1989, for the Spanish comedy show El D√≠a Por Delante (The Day Ahead), he had to wear a Superman costume for a comedic sketch, a job that made him question whether he wanted to be an actor at all. Bardem has confessed to having worked as a stripper (for one day only) during his struggling acting career.  Career  Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture, The Ages of Lulu, when he was 21, in which he appeared along with his mother, Pilar Bardem. Bigas Luna, the director of Lulu, was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film, Jam√≥n Jam√≥n in 1992, in which Bardem played a would-be underwear model and bullfighter. The film, which also starred a teenaged Pen√©lope Cruz, was a major international success. He then starred again in Luna's next film Golden Balls (1993). Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in the English-speaking world. In 1997, John Malkovich was the first to approach him, then a 27-year- old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor. His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with director √Ålex de la Iglesia's Perdita Durango, playing a santer√≠a-practicing bank robber. After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls in 2000, portraying Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. He received praise from his idol Al Pacino; the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received. For that role, he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of Danny Witwer in Minority Report which eventually went to Colin Farrell. Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in Malkovich's directorial debut, The Dancer Upstairs. Malkovich originally had Bardem in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie's time trying to find financing gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. \\"I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English\\", Bardem has said of Malkovich. Javier Bardem and the Coen brothers at the Cannes Film Festival 2007 Bardem won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his role in Mar Adentro (2004), released in the United States as The Sea Inside, in which he portrayed the quadriplegic turned assisted suicide activist Ram√≥n Sampedro. He made his Hollywood debut in a brief appearance as a crime lord who summons Tom Cruise's hitman to do the dirty work of dispatching witnesses in the crime drama Collateral. He stars in Milo≈° Forman's 2006 film Goya's Ghosts opposite Natalie Portman, where he plays a twisted monk during the Spanish Inquisition. In 2007, Bardem acted in two film adaptations: the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men, and the adaptation of the Colombian novel Love in the Time of Cholera with Giovanna Mezzogiorno by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. In No Country for Old Men, he played a sociopathic assassin, Anton Chigurh. For that role, he became the first Spaniard to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also won a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the 2008 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best Supporting Actor. Bardem's rendition of Chigurh's trademark word, \\"What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?\\" (in response to the convenience store owner's query, \\"Ya'll gettin' any rain up your way?\\"), was named Top HollyWORDIE of 2007 in the annual survey by the Global Language Monitor. Chigurh was named No. 26 in Entertainment Weekly magazine's 2008 \\"50 Most Vile Villains in Movie History\\" list.50 Most Vile Movie Villains Part 2, Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved 26 May 2008. Bardem's life's work was honored at the 2007 Gotham Awards, produced by Independent Feature Project. Bardem at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 Francis Ford Coppola singled out Bardem as an heir to, and even improvement on, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro, referring to Bardem as ambitious, hungry, unwilling to rest on his laurels and always \\"excited to do something good.\\" Bardem was attached to play the role of Tetro's mentor in Coppola's film Tetro, but the director felt the character should be female, so he was replaced by fellow Spaniard Carmen Maura. Bardem was originally cast to play fictional filmmaker Guido Contini in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Nine, but dropped out due to exhaustion. The part eventually went to Daniel Day-Lewis.BroadwayWorld.com \\"Daniel Day- Lewis Signed for Nine Film; Rehearsals to Start in July; Shooting September\\" 2008-6-1. Retrieved 16 February 2009. He went on to star alongside Pen√©lope Cruz and Scarlett Johansson in Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). left In 2010, he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in Biutiful directed by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, who specifically wrote the film with Bardem in mind. After being overlooked by the Globes and SAG, Bardem was the unexpected Oscar nominee on 25 January 2011, becoming the first all Spanish-language Best Actor nominee ever. He won his 5th Goya Award, this time for Best Actor in Biutiful, dedicating the win to his wife, Pen√©lope Cruz, and newborn son. Around this same time he was offered the lead role of \\"Gunslinger\\" Roland Deschain in Ron Howard's adaptation of Stephen King's Dark Tower novels. If he had signed, he would have starred in the TV series as well. Then Eon Productions offered him a role as villain Raoul Silva in the James Bond film, Skyfall.. . With Universal deciding not to go forward with the ultra-ambitious adaptation of the Stephen King 7-novel series, and to end months of speculation, Bardem officially confirmed his role in Skyfall during an interview with Christiane Amanpour for ABC's Nightline. Bardem received the 2,484th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 November 2012. The star is located outside the El Capitan Theatre. With his movie Sons of the Clouds: The Last Colony (2012), he demonstrated the suffering of the Sahrawi people in refugee camps. He publicly denounced the UN as unwilling to definitively resolve the human crisis there. Bardem portrayed the main antagonist, Armando Salazar, in 2017's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the fifth film in the series. In September 2017, Bardem starred with Jennifer Lawrence, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Ed Harris in the horror film Mother! from director Darren Aronofsky, which focuses on a couple whose lives are disrupted by the arrival of unexpected guests. In 2018, Bardem appeared on screen together with his spouse Pen√©lope Cruz in Asghar Farhadi new feature film Everybody Knows. Bardem is set to play Frankenstein's Monster in the 2019 remake of the Bride of Frankenstein, directed by Bill Condon. In February 2019, Bardem was cast as Stilgar in the upcoming Denis Villeneuve film Dune. In July of that year, he entered talks to play King Triton in Disney's live- action movie, The Little Mermaid.  Personal life  Bardem's native language is Spanish and he is also fluent in English. He is a fan of heavy metal music, and credits the band AC/DC for helping him learn to speak English, in some respects. Bardem cannot drive, only getting behind the wheel for film roles, and he consistently refers to himself as a \\"worker\\", and not an actor. Bardem was raised as a Catholic. Following the legalization of same-sex marriage in Spain in 2005, Bardem stated that if he were gay, he would get married \\"right away tomorrow, just to screw the Church\\" (ma√±ana mismo, s√≥lo para joder a la Iglesia). He is now agnostic. He has later said that while he does not believe strongly in the supernatural, he does not deny it. \\"We are just this little tiny spot in the whole universe, so of course there must be other things, other people, other creatures, other lives and other dimensions.

It stars Ed Harris, Marcia Gay Harden, Jennifer Connelly, Robert Knott, Bud Cort, Molly Regan and Sada Thompson, and was directed by Harris. Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for portraying Lee Krasner, Pollock's wife. Ed Harris received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Pollock. The film was a long-term personal project for Harris based on his previous reading of Pollock's 1989 biography Jackson Pollock: An American Saga. Plot The film opens in medias res to abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock, autographing a copy of Life magazine for a woman at his 1950 art exhibit. Nine years earlier, Pollock exhibits paintings in occasional group art shows. He lives with his brother, Sande, and sister-in-law, Arloie, in a tiny New York apartment. Arloie says she and Sande are expecting a baby, hinting that Pollock should move out. Soon afterward, Pollock meets and takes an interest in artist Lee Krasner. He learns later that his brother has taken a job in Connecticut building military gliders to avoid the draft. Pollock goes on a drinking binge and is found in a disheveled state by Sande and Lee. Sande tells Lee that Pollock has been diagnosed as \\"clinically neurotic\\". Lee takes him home and becomes his manager. One day, Pollock's old friend, Reuben Kadish, visits, bringing along Howard Putzel, who works for wealthy art collector, Peggy Guggenheim. After Guggenheim views his work, he is given a contract to exhibit his paintings, plus a commission to paint a 8 ft by 20 ft mural in her New York townhouse entry way. Pollock's first exhibit fails to attract any buyers. After a New Year's Eve party, Pollock almost sleeps with Peggy, but is too drunk. He falls into another drunken stupor upon hearing that Putzel has died. Pollock and Lee are wed after Lee says they either marry or \\"split up\\". After they move to Long Island, Pollock is dismayed that Lee does not want children. At a get-together at Peggy's, Pollock dismisses art critic Clement Greenberg's comments, and refuses to change his painting style to be more marketable. Pollock's paintings are not selling, but Clement assures him it will change after a Life article about him is published and his upcoming exhibit. Lee and Pollock's marriage is strained after he openly flirts with another woman. Meanwhile, to earn income, Pollock tries various occupations but fails due to his alcoholism. He lies to Sande about his financial status, though this improves after the Life story about him is published. Later, Hans Namuth films Pollock as he paints, though Namuth's presence interrupts the spontaneous nature of Pollock's work. Pollock, who tried abstaining from alcohol, begins drinking again and ruins Thanksgiving dinner. Five years after the 1950 exhibit, Clement tells Pollock that the Partisan Review is favoring artist Clyfford Still, and says his original technique could be the next direction of modern art. A drunk Pollock reacts badly, and becomes even angrier when Lee berates him for his drinking and womanizing. Pollock blames Lee because she will not have a child. Lee knows about his affair with Ruth Kligman, but refuses to divorce Jackson. In 1956, Lee call Pollack while she is in Venice. After, he tells Ruth, \\"I owe the woman something\\". On a subsequent visit, Ruth brings along her friend, Edith. The three go for a drive, but Pollock is drunk and crashes the car, killing himself and Edith, and throwing Ruth from the car, seriously injuring her.

Inspired by the life and work of the Marquis de Sade, Quills re- imagines the last years of the Marquis's incarceration in the insane asylum at Charenton. It stars Geoffrey Rush as de Sade, Joaquin Phoenix as the Abb√© du Coulmier, Michael Caine as Dr. Royer-Collard, and Kate Winslet as laundress Madeleine \\"Maddie\\" LeClerc. Well received by critics, Quills garnered numerous accolades for Rush, including nominations for an Oscar, BAFTA and a Golden Globe. The film was a modest art house success, averaging $27,709 per screen its debut weekend, and eventually grossing $17,989,277 internationally. Cited by historians as factually inaccurate, Quills filmmakers and writers said they were not making a biography of de Sade, but exploring issues such as censorship, pornography, sex, art, mental illness, and religion. It was released with an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America and an 18 rating from the British Board of Film Classification due to \\"strong horror, violence, sex, sexual violence, and nudity\\". Plot Quills begins in Paris during the Reign of Terror, with the incarcerated Marquis de Sade penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renard, a ravishing young aristocrat who meets the imprisoned preeminent sadist. Several years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at Charenton, overseen by the enlightened Abb√© du Coulmier. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine \\"Maddy\\" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman (Tom Ward) to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, Justine, is published on the black market to great success. Emperor Napol√©on I Bonaparte orders all copies of the book to be torched and the author shot, but his advisor, Delben√©, tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send alienist Dr. Royer-Collard to assess Charenton and silence the Marquis. Meanwhile, the Abb√© teaches Madeleine to read and write, while she resists his growing attraction to her. Madeleine reads the Marquis de Sade's stories to her fellow workers. Whilst Madeleine is fascinated with the Marquis de Sade she remains reluctant to give in to his advances. The Abb√© and Marquis converse on the Marquis' inappropriate advances on young women. Dr. Royer- Collard arrives, informing the Abb√© that the Marquis' \\"therapeutic writings\\" have been distributed for public consumption. He presents the Abb√© with the ultimatum of silencing the Marquis or Charenton will be shut down by order of the Emperor. The Abb√© rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several aggressive archaic \\"treatments\\" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience (winking at Madeleine through a peephole). Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage orphan Simone. They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prouix, on hand for its renovation. The hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition, which Dr Royer-Collard and his young wife attend. The audacious play, a shockingly straightforward parallel of the good doctor's own misogynist domination of his virginal bride, is titled \\"The Crimes of Love\\". The performance is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon molests Madeleine off- stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. The Abb√© is seen publicly comforting Madeleine. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abb√© do more to control the Marquis, or he will inform the ministry that the inmates are running the asylum. Infuriated, the Abb√© confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink. The Marquis's wife visits him and he takes out his frustration at not being able to write on her; she retaliates by asking a surprised Dr Royer-Collard that the Marquis be entombed forever. They discuss that the ill-gotten gains from the Marquis's books could be used to effect his salvation, in other words, provide forms of restraint. The lack of writing implements results in more subversive behaviour from the Marquis, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell. Charlotte, one of the maids, reveals that Madeleine has been helping the Marquis. Madeleine is whipped on the order of Dr. Royer-Collard until the Abb√© stops him by offering himself instead. The Abb√© decides that Madeleine must be sent away. That night she visits his chamber to beg him to reconsider sending her away and confesses her love for him in the process, prompting him to kiss her passionately. They abruptly break away at the realization of what they are doing. Madeleine runs off and Charlotte catches the Abb√© calling after her. Meanwhile, Royer-Collard violently raped Simone on their wedding night, and continues to keep her as a virtual prisoner. She purchases a copy of Justine, seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off to England together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of Justine. Upon finding this, Royer-Collard refocuses attention upon the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge by having him tortured. About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and attacks Madeleine. Royer-Collard hears Madeleine's screams but chooses to ignore them and she is killed by Bouchon. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells. Madeleine's body is found by her blind mother and the Abb√© in the laundry vat. The Abb√© is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an iron maiden. The Abb√© blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin. The Abb√© has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for his involvement, but is riddled with remorse and physically punishes himself. The Abb√© then has a dream in which Madeleine comes alive and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using feces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abb√© reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it. A year later, the new Abb√© arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour by Royer-Collard. During the tour they meet the maid Charlotte and through the exchange between herself and Royer-Collard it is apparent that there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abb√© meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abb√©, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures to close the peephole. The Abb√© is herded off by Royer-Collard before he can hear any more from his predecessor. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abb√© begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration. Cast * Geoffrey Rush as the Marquis de Sade; Director Philip Kaufman encouraged Rush to portray the Marquis as something of a dissolute rock star holed up in the Ritz Carlton. Rush used Francine du Plessix Gray's 1998 biography At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life as a reference and had previously acted in a production of Marat/Sade. * Kate Winslet as Madeleine \\"Maddy\\" LeClerc; Screenwriter Doug Wright called Winslet the \\"patron saint\\" of the movie for being the first big name to back it, expressing interest as early as April 1999. * Joaquin Phoenix as the Abb√© du Coulmier; Before settling on Joaquin Phoenix, casting directors considered Jude Law, Guy Pearce, and Billy Crudup for the role. * Michael Caine as Dr. Royer-Collard; Kaufman drew comparisons between Royer-Collard and Kenneth Starr, particularly the publication of de Sade's works at the Charenton Printing Press and the release of Starr's report online. * Billie Whitelaw as Madame LeClerc * Stephen Marcus as Bouchon * Amelia Warner as Simone * Stephen Moyer as Prioux * Jane Menelaus as Ren√©e Pelagie * Ron Cook as Napol√©on I Bonaparte * Patrick Malahide as Delben√© * Elizabeth Berrington as Charlotte * Tony Pritchard as Valcour * Michael Jenn as Cleante * Edward Tudor-Pole as Franval Production The interior set of the Charenton (asylum) in Quills was built at Pinewood Studios, where most of the filming took place. Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, and London stood in for the exterior shots of early 19th century France. Oscar-winning production designer Martin Childs (Shakespeare in Love) imagined the primary location of Charenton as an airy, though circuitous place, darkening as Royer-Collard takes over operations. The screenplay specifies the way the inmates' rooms link together, which plays a key role in the relay of the Marquis' climactic story to Madeleine. Screenwriter/playwright Doug Wright was a constant presence on set, assisting the actors and producers in interpreting the script and bringing his vision to life. Casting directors Donna Isaacson and Priscilla John recruited a number of actors from a disabled actor's company to play the parts of many of the inmates at Charenton. Oscar-nominated costume designer Jacqueline West created the intricate period costumes, using each character as inspiration. West previously worked with director Philip Kaufman on his crime drama Rising Sun. For Joaquin Phoenix's Abb√©, costumers designed special \\"pleather\\" clogs to accommodate the actor's veganism. In one scene, Rush's Marquis de Sade wears a suit decorated in bloody script, which West described as \\"challenging\\" to make. It features actual writings of de Sade and costumers planned exactly where each sentence should go on the fabric. Before production began, West gave Winslet a copy of French painter L√©opold Boilly's \\"Woman Ironing\\" to give her a feel for the character, which Winslet said greatly influenced her performance. Music The Quills soundtrack was released by RCA Victor on 21 November 2000 featuring the music of Oscar-winning composer Stephen Warbeck (Shakespeare in Love). Featuring experimental instrumentation on such instruments as the serpent, the mediaeval shawm, and the bucket, most reviewers were intrigued by the unconventional and thematic score. Cinemusic.net reviewer Ryan Keaveney called the album a \\"macabre masterpiece\\", with an \\"addicting and mesmerizing\\" sound. Urban Cinephile contributor Brad Green described the album as a \\"hedonistic pleasure\\" that \\"captures the spirit of an incorrigible, perverse genius.\\" Soundtrack.net's Glenn McClanan disliked the \\"lack of unifying unified themes and motifs\\" that may have served each individual scene, but made the film feel \\"incoherent.\\" ;Track listing # \\"The Marquis and the Scaffold\\" ‚Äì 3:08 # \\"The Abbe and Madeleine\\" ‚Äì 2:19 # \\"The Convent\\" ‚Äì 2:22 # \\"Plans for a Burial\\" ‚Äì 1:18 # \\"Dream of Madeleine\\" ‚Äì 4:42 # \\"Royer-Collard and Bouchon\\" ‚Äì 4:15 # \\"Aphrodisiac\\" ‚Äì 2:59 # \\"The Last Story\\" ‚Äì 7:35 # \\"The Marquis' Cell at Charenton\\" ‚Äì 4:38 # \\"The End: A New Manuscript\\" ‚Äì 7:32 # \\"The Printing Press\\" ‚Äì 2:22 Though not included on the soundtrack, the opening notes of \\"Au Clair de la Lune\\", a traditional French children's song, recur throughout the film, usually hummed by the Marquis. The song is originally sung by John Hamway during the opening scene of a beheading which was filmed in Oxford. The English translation provides some illumination as to its selection as a theme for the Marquis: By the light of the moon, My friend Pierrot, Lend me your quill, To write a word. My candle is dead, I have no more fire. Open your door for me For the love of God. By the light of the moon, Pierrot replied: \\"I don't have any pens, I am in my bed Go to the neighbor's, I think she's there Because in her kitchen Someone is lighting the fire...\\" Release =Box office= Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures in 2000, Quills premiered in the United States at the Telluride Film Festival on 2 September 2000. It was given a limited release on 22 November 2000, with a wider release following on 15 December 2000. The film earned $249,383 its opening weekend in nine theaters, totaling $7,065,332 domestically and $10,923,895 internationally, for a total of $17,989,227. =Home media= Quills was released on NTSC VHS and Region 1 DVD on 8 May 2001, with PAL VHS and Region 2 DVD to follow on 29 October 2001. The DVD contains a feature-long commentary track by screenwriter/playwright Doug Wright and three featurettes: \\"Marquis on Marquee\\", \\"Creating Charenton\\", and \\"Dressing the Part.\\" Also included are the theatrical trailer, a television spot, a photo gallery, a music promotional spot, and a feature called \\"Fact & Film: Historical and Production Information.\\" Critical reception The film holds a 75% \\"fresh\\" rating at the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Though hard to watch, this film's disturbing exploration of freedom of expression is both seductive and thought-provoking.\\" It has an average score of 70/100 at Metacritic, based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times complimented the \\"euphoric stylishness\\" of Kaufman's direction and Geoffrey Rush's \\"gleeful... flamboyant\\" performance. Peter Travers for Rolling Stone wrote about the \\"exceptional\\" actors, particularly Geoffrey Rush's \\"scandalously good\\" performance as the Marquis, populating a film that is \\"literate, erotic, and spoiling to be heard\\". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com enthused over the \\"delectable and ultimately terrifying fantasy\\" of Quills, with Rush as \\"sun king\\", enriched by a \\"luminous\\" supporting cast. In December 2000, film critic Roger Ebert wrote an article on Quills in which he rated it 3.5 stars out of 4 and stated, \\"The message of 'Quills' is perhaps that we are all expressions of our natures, and to live most successfully we must understand that.\\" The film was not without its detractors, including Richard Schickel of Time magazine, who decried director Philip Kaufman's approach as \\"brutally horrific, vulgarly unamusing\\", creating a film that succeeds only as \\"soft-gore porn\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times dismissed the film as an \\"overripe contrivance masquerading as high art\\", while de Sade biographer Neil Schaeffer in The Guardian criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de Sade's complex life. =Accolades= Quills received three Oscar nominations at the 73rd Academy Awards for Best Actor (Geoffrey Rush, previous winner for 1996's Shine), Art Direction (Art: Martin Childs, Sets: Jill Quertier), and Costume Design (Jacqueline West). The film was also nominated by the Hollywood Foreign Press, organizers of the Golden Globes, for Best Actor in a Drama (Geoffrey Rush) and Best Screenplay (Douglas Wright). The National Board of Review selected Quills as its Best Film of 2000. Historical inaccuracies Neil Schaeffer, detailed a number of disparities between fact and film. Schaeffer, whose The Marquis de Sade: A Life was used by Director Philip Kaufman as reference, in a review published in The Guardian, criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de Sade's complex life. Schaeffer especially criticized the depiction of the de Sade as a \\"martyr to the oppression and censorship of church and state\\" and that the film distorted facts \\"to a surreal and didactic conclusion that has no connection with the truth, and is probably overwrought even as a twist of a fictional plot\\", namely that \\"the seemingly good people are all bad underneath, are all hypocrites, while the seemingly bad person, de Sade, probably has some redeeming qualities\\". Schaeffer relates that de Sade's initial incarceration \\"had nothing to do with his writing\\" but with sexual scandals involving servants, prostitutes, and his sister-in-law. He also criticized the opening scene's implication that the reign of terror caused the \\"sanguinary streak\\" of de Sade's writing, when \\"his bloodiest and best work, 120 Days of Sodom, was written in the Bastille ‚Äî obviously before the revolution\\" and not at Charenton, as suggested by the film. In contrast to the film, the historical de Sade was \\"not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers\\" while at Charenton, nor did he cut the \\"tall, trim figure of the Australian actor Geoffrey Rush\\" but was of middling height and, at the time, of a \\"considerable, even a grotesque, obesity\\". The manuscripts smuggled out of the asylum were not the novel Justine, which features prominently in the film but was published thirteen years before de Sade's incarceration at the asylum. De Sade's smuggled works were not particularly outrageous, mostly consisting of conventional novels and a number of plays he worked on throughout his life in hopes of having them performed. Most of these were soundly rejected by publishers. De Sade was, in fact, involved in the theater productions at Charenton, though none like the play featured in Quills. The plays performed were popular, conventional Parisian dramas.These productions were also the inspiration for the 1963 play and 1967 film Marat/Sade. The government shut the Charenton theater down on 6 May 1813, years before the real Dr. Royer-Collard had any influence at Charenton. Schaeffer criticized also the film's treatment of de Sade's personal relations regarding his wife (who had formally separated from him after the revolution), the chambermaid (who did not serve as a liaison to a publisher but with whom he had a sexual relationship from her early teens until shortly before his death), and his \\"companion of many years\\" who had a room at Charenton (and actually smuggled out the manuscripts) but is ignored by the film. Furthermore, \\"De Sade's hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth, for he died in his sleep, in his 74th year, as peacefully as any good Christian\\". Schaeffer argues that the main point of de Sade's life and writing was not, \\"as movie-makers and reviewers alike seem to think ... to oppose censorship\\" but \\"to push the limits ‚Äì sexual, spiritual, and political ‚Äì as a means of feeling out the limits of his times and of his own mind.\\" Schaeffer criticized that the film \\"simplifies de Sade into a modern \\"victim\\" and over- emphasises his potential as a focus for liberal-political meanings when, in fact, his life and perhaps his literary intentions - if you think of him as a satirist - can be seen as an object lesson, warning against the excesses of cultural relativism and nihilism; a very modern lesson, it would seem.\\" Schaeffer advised the viewer to distinguish between de Sade and the protagonist of the film: \\"To see if Quills is valid in its own terms, let the viewer imagine it is about someone else, let us say the Marquis de Newcastle, and that the scene is Bedlam and then see if the movie makes any sense.\\" According to Kaufman, Doug Wright did not have the rights to the original translations and therefore had to create and write the passages of de Sade's work that are included in the original play and the film. He applied the vocabulary used in the translations to the passages to imitate de Sade's style but the archaic language comes across as funny to a modern viewer whereas in the 1700s, as stated by Kaufman, these words were \\"incendiary\\".

Saint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to tradition, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. In the New Testament The son of Zebedee and Salome, James is styled \\"the Greater\\" to distinguish him from the Apostle James \\"the Less\\", with greater meaning older or taller, rather than more important. He was the brother of John the Apostle. James is described as one of the first disciples to join Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels state that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to follow him. James was one of only three apostles whom Jesus selected to bear witness to his Transfiguration., , . James and John (or, in another tradition, their mother) asked Jesus to grant them seats on his right and left in his glory. Jesus rebuked them, and the other apostles were annoyed with them.

Shield with symbol of St. James the Great, Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) The Acts of the Apostles records that \\"Herod the king\\" (traditionally identified with Herod Agrippa) had James executed by the sword. Nixon suggests that this may have been caused by James's fiery temper,R. E. Nixon, \\"Boanerges\\", in J. D. Douglas (ed.), The New Bible Dictionary (London: The Inter-Varsity Fellowship, 1963), 1354, in which he and his brother earned the nickname Boanerges or \\"Sons of Thunder\\". F. F. Bruce contrasts this story to that of the Liberation of Saint Peter, and notes that \\"James should die while Peter should escape\\" is a \\"mystery of divine providence\\".F. F.

He is depicted clothed as a pilgrim; note the scallop shell on his shoulder and his staff and pilgrim's hat beside him. In the Catholic tradition, Saint James is the patron saint of Spain and, according to legend, his remains are held in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. This name Santiago is the local evolution of Latin Genitive Sancti Iacobi, \\"(church or sanctuary) of Saint James\\" (evolved into a personal name in Spanish, and also in Portuguese -Tiago-, with its derivatives Diego/Diogo). The traditional pilgrimage to the grave of the saint, known as the \\"Way of St. James\\", has been the most popular pilgrimage for Western European Catholics from the Early Middle Ages onwards, although its modern revival and popularity stems from Walter Starkie's 1957 book, The Road to Santiago. The Pilgrims of St. James.New York, E. P. Dutton, 1957, OCLC 28087235; reprinted by the Univ. of California Press in 1965 (OCLC 477436336) and published in Spanish translation in 1958 with the somewhat different title of El camino de Santiago: las peregrinaciones al sepulcro del Ap√≥stol, trans. Amando L√°zaro Ros, Madrid, Aguilar, 1958, OCLC 432856567. Both the English original and the translation have been republished. Officially 327,378 pilgrims registered in 2018 as having completed the final 100 km walk (200 km by bicycle) to Santiago to qualify for a Compostela. When 25 July falls on a Sunday, it is a \\"Holy Year\\" (an A√±o Santo Jacobeo) and a special east door is opened for entrance into Santiago Cathedral. Jubilee years follow a 6-5-6-11 pattern (except when the last year of a century isn't a leap year, which can yield a gap of 7 or 12 years). In the 2004 Holy Year, 179,944 pilgrims received a Compostela. In the 2010 Holy Year the number had risen to 272,412. The next Holy Year will be 2021. The feast day of St. James is celebrated on 25 July on the liturgical calendars of the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and certain Protestant churches. He is commemorated on 30 April in the Orthodox Christian liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 30 April currently falls on 13 May of the modern Gregorian Calendar). The national day of Galicia is also celebrated on 25 July, being St James its patron saint. Jerusalem The site of martyrdom is located within the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral of St. James in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. The Chapel of St. James the Great, located to the left of the sanctuary, is the traditional place where he was martyred, when King Agrippa ordered him to be beheaded (Acts 12:1‚Äì2). His head is buried under the altar, marked by a piece of red marble and surrounded by six votive lamps. Spain =Mission in Spain and burial at Compostela= According to Catholic tradition, Apostle James, son of Zebedee, spread Christianity in Spain. In the year 44, he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat, to the place where stands Santiago de Compostela Cathedral. The 12th-century Historia Compostelana commissioned by bishop Diego Gelm√≠rez provides a summary of the legend of St. James, as it was believed at Compostela at that time. Two propositions are central to it: first, that St. James preached the gospel in Spain, as well as in the Holy Land; second, that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa, his disciples carried his body by sea to Iberia, where they landed at Padr√≥n on the coast of Galicia, then took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela. The translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was done, in legend, by a series of miraculous happenings: decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself, his body was taken up by angels, and sailed in a rudderless, unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Iberia, where a massive rock closed around his relics, which were later removed to Compostela. According to ancient local tradition, on 2 January AD 40, the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta, while he was preaching the Gospel in Spain. She appeared upon a pillar, Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, in Zaragoza, Spain. Following that apparition, St. James returned to Judea, where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44. The tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II (791‚Äì842) and of bishop Theodemir of Iria. These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century, and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia in Spain, became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world. The Way of St. James is a network of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain. Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain. Controversy James suffered martyrdom in AD 44. According to the tradition of the early Church, he had not yet left Jerusalem at this time.Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis, VI; Apollonius, quoted by Eusebius of Caesarea, Ecclesiastical History V.xviii) An argument supporting this assertion is based on the Epistle to the Romans, written after AD 44, in which Paul expressed his intention to avoid \\"building on someone else's foundation\\" by visiting Spain, suggesting that he knew of no previous evangelisation in Hispania. The suggestion began to be made from the 9th century that, as well as evangelizing in Iberia, James' body was brought to and is buried in Compostela. No earlier tradition places the burial of St. James in Spain. A rival tradition places the relics of the apostle in the church of St. Saturnin at Toulouse; if any physical relics were ever involved, they might plausibly have been divided between the two. The tradition of Saint James' burial in Compostela was not unanimously accepted, and numerous modern scholars, following Louis Duchesne and T. E. Kendrick,\\"Saint James in Spain\\", London, 1960 reject it. (According to Kendrick, even if one admits the existence of miracles, James' presence in Spain is impossible.) The Catholic Encyclopedia (1908) registered several \\"difficulties\\" or bases for doubts of this tradition, beyond the late appearance of the legend: The Bollandists, however, defended it. (Their Acta Sanctorum, July, VI and VII, gives further sources.) A belief in the authenticity of the relics at Compostela was also asserted by Pope Leo XIII, in his 1884 bull Omnipotens Deus. =Medieval \\"Santiago Matamoros\\" legend= Saint James as the Moor-killer by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest). His mantle is that of his military order. An even later tradition states that he miraculously appeared to fight for the Christian army during the legendary battle of Clavijo, and was henceforth called Santiago Matamoros (Saint James the Moor-slayer). ¬°Santiago, y cierra, Espa√±a! (\\"St. James and strike for Spain\\") was the traditional battle cry of medieval Spanish (Christian) armies. Miguel de Cervantes has Don Quixote explaining that \\"the great knight of the russet cross was given by God to Spain as patron and protector\\".Don Quixote, 2nd section, chapter 58 A similar miracle is related to San Mill√°n. The possibility that a cult of James was instituted to supplant the Galician cult of Priscillian (executed in 385) who was widely venerated across the north of Iberia as a martyr (at the hands of the local bishops, rather than as a heretic) should not be overlooked. This was cautiously raised by Henry Chadwick in his book on Priscillian; it is not the traditional Roman Catholic view. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1908, however, is quite cautious about the origins of the cult (see above at \\"Controversy\\"). =Emblem= The Cross of Saint James, the symbol of the Order of Santiago; the hilt is surmounted with a scallop. James' emblem was the scallop shell (or \\"cockle shell\\"), and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes. The French term for a scallop is coquille St. Jacques, which means \\"cockle (or mollusk) of [St.] James\\". The German word for a scallop is Jakobsmuschel, which means \\"mussel (or clam) of St. James\\"; the Dutch word is Jacobs schelp, meaning \\"the shell of St. James\\". In Danish and with the same meaning as in Dutch the word is Ibskal, Ib being a Danish- language version of the name Jakob and skal meaning shell. =Military Order of Santiago= The military Order of Santiago, named after James, was founded in Spain in the 12th century to fight the Moors. Later, as in other orders of chivalry, the membership became a mark of honor. Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that James has been resurrected and that in 1829 he‚Äîalong with the resurrected Peter and the translated John‚Äîvisited Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and restored the priesthood authority with apostolic succession to earth.Doctrine and Covenants 27:12. In Islam The Quranic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John and Simon the Zealot.

Kaunas was the biggest city and the centre of a county in the Duchy of Trakai of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Trakai Palatinate since 1413. In the Russian Empire, it was the capital of the Kaunas Governorate from 1843 to 1915. During the interwar period, it served as the temporary capital of Lithuania, when Vilnius was seized by Poland between 1920 and 1939. During that period Kaunas was celebrated for its rich cultural and academic life, fashion, construction of countless Art Deco and Lithuanian National Romanticism architectural-style buildings as well as popular furniture, the interior design of the time, and a widespread caf√© culture. The city interwar architecture is regarded as among the finest examples of European Art Deco and has received the European Heritage Label. It contributed to Kaunas being named as the first city in Central and Eastern Europe to be designated as a UNESCO City of Design. Kaunas has been selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2022, together with Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. The city is the capital of Kaunas County, and the seat of the Kaunas city municipality and the Kaunas District Municipality. It is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas. Kaunas is located at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the Nemunas and the Neris, and is near the Kaunas Reservoir, the largest body of water in the whole of Lithuania. As defined by Eurostat, the population of Kaunas functional urban area, that stretches beyond the city limits, is estimated at 383,764 (as of 2017),\\"Population on 1 January by age groups and sex - functional urban areas\\". Eurostat. Retrieved 15 June 2019. while according to statistics of Kaunas territorial health insurance fund, there are 437,283 permanent inhabitants (as of 2018) in Kaunas city and Kaunas district municipalities combined. Etymology View of Kaunas, Lithuania The Kaunas city's name is of Lithuanian origin and most likely derives from a personal name. Before Lithuania regained independence, the city was generally known in English as Kovno, the traditional Slavicized form of its name. The Polish name is ' ; the Belarusian name is , ' . An earlier Russian name was ', although ' has been used since 1940. The Yiddish name is ', and the names in German include ' and '. The city and its elderates also have names in other languages (see Names of Kaunas in other languages and names of Kaunas elderates in other languages). Folk history An old legend claims that Kaunas was established by the Romans in ancient times. These Romans were supposedly led by a patrician named Palemon, who had three sons: Barcus, Kunas and Sperus. Palemon fled from Rome because he feared the mad Emperor Nero. Palemon, his sons and other relatives travelled to Lithuania. After Palemon's death, his sons divided his land. Kunas got the land where Kaunas now stands. He built a fortress near the confluence of the Nemunas and Neris rivers, and the city that grew up there was named after him. A suburban region in the vicinity is named \\"Palemonas\\". Coat of arms Great coat of arms of Kaunas On 30 June 1993, the historical coat of arms of Kaunas city was re-established by a special presidential decree. The coat of arms features a white aurochs with a golden cross between its horns, set against a deep red background. The aurochs was the original heraldic symbol of the city, established in 1400. The heraldic seal of Kaunas, introduced in the early 15th century during the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas, is the oldest city heraldic seal known in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The current emblem was the result of much study and discussion on the part of the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission, and realized by the artist Raimondas Mikneviƒçius. An aurochs has replaced a wisent, which was depicted in the Soviet-era emblem that was used since 1969. Blazon: Gules, an aurochs passant guardant argent ensigned with a cross Or between his horns. Kaunas also has a greater coat of arms, which is mainly used for purposes of Kaunas city representation. The sailor, three golden balls, and Latin text \\"Diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram\\" (English: Cherish justice, you who judge the earth) in the greater coat of arms refers to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of merchants and seafarers, who was regarded as a heavenly guardian of Kaunas by Queen Bona Sforza. History =Early history= St. Anne (Vytautas the Great) Church Kaunas Cathedral Basilica According to the archeological excavations, the richest collections of ceramics and other artifacts found at the confluence of the Nemunas and the Neris rivers are from the second and first millennium BC. During that time, people settled in some territories of the present Kaunas: the confluence of the two longest rivers of Lithuania area, Eiguliai, Lampƒód≈æiai, Linkuva, Kani≈´kai, Marvelƒó, Pajiesys, Romainiai, Petra≈°i≈´nai, Sargƒónai, and Ver≈°vai sites. =Grand Duchy of Lithuania= Vytautas the Great Monument in Kaunas A settlement had been established on the site of the current Kaunas old town, at the confluence of two large rivers, at least by the 10th century AD. Kaunas is first mentioned in written sources in 1361 when the brick Kaunas Castle was constructed. In 1362, the castle was captured after a siege and destroyed by the Teutonic Order. Commander Vaidotas of the Kaunas castle garrison, with 36 men, tried to break through, but was taken prisoner. It was one of the largest and important military victories of the Teutonic Knights in the 14th century against Lithuania. The Kaunas castle was rebuilt at the beginning of the 15th century.Places to Visit: \\"Kaunas Castle\\", Kaunas City Municipality. In 1408, the town was granted Magdeburg rights by Vytautas the Great and became a centre of Kaunas Powiat in Trakai Voivodeship in 1413. Vytautas ceded Kaunas the right to own the scales used for weighing the goods brought to the city or packed on site, wax processing, and woolen cloth-trimming facilities. The power of the self-governing Kaunas was shared by three interrelated major institutions: vaitas (the Mayor), the Magistrate (12 lay judges and 4 burgomasters), and the so-called Benchers' Court (12 persons). Kaunas began to gain prominence, since it was at an intersection of trade routes and a river port. In 1441 Kaunas joined the Hanseatic League, and Hansa merchant office Kontor was opened‚Äîthe only one in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the 16th century, Kaunas also had a public school and a hospital and was one of the best-formed towns in the whole country. In 1665, the Russian army attacked the city several times, and in 1701 the city was occupied by the Swedish Army. The Black Death struck the area in 1657 and 1708, killing many residents. Fires destroyed parts of the city in 1731 and 1732.Kaunas History. Retrieved on 12 April 2011. =Russian Empire= One of the Kaunas Fortress barracks Kaunas Priest Seminary was one of the centers of the Lithuanian National Revival during the Russification era After the third and final partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state in 1795, the city was taken over by the Russian Empire and became a part of Vilna Governorate. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Grand Army of Napoleon passed through Kaunas twice, devastating the city both times. A hill fort mound in Kaunas is named Napoleon's Hill. To prevent possible easy access through the city and protect the western borders of Russia, the Kovno Fortress was built. It is still visible throughout the town. Kovno Governorate, with a centre in Kovno (Kaunas), was formed in 1843. In 1862, a railway connecting the Russian Empire and Imperial Germany was built, making Kaunas a significant railway hub with one of the first railway tunnels in the Empire, completed in 1861. In 1898 the first power plant in Lithuania started operating. AB Lietuvos Energija. Development of Lithuanian Energy Sector. After the unsuccessful January Uprising against the Russian Empire, tsarist authority moved the Catholic Seminary of Varniai, prominent bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius and Samogitian diocese institutions to Kaunas, where they were given the former Bernardine Monastery Palace and St. George the Martyr Church. Only selected noblemen were permitted to study in the Seminary, with the only exception being peasant son Antanas Baranauskas, who illegally received the nobleman documents from Karolina Praniauskaitƒó. He began lectures using the Lithuanian language, rather than Russian, and greatly influenced the spirit of the seminarians by narrating about the ancient Lithuania and especially its earthwork mounds. Later, many of the Seminary students were active in Lithuanian book smuggling; its chief main objective was to resist the Russification policy. Kaunas Spiritual Seminary finally became completely Lithuanian when in 1909 professor Jonas Maƒçiulis-Maironis became the rector of the Seminary, and replaced use of the Polish language for teaching with the Lithuanian language. Prior to the Second World War, Kaunas, like many cities in eastern Europe, had a significant Jewish population. According to the Russian census of 1897, Jews numbered 25,500, 35.3% of the total of 73,500. The population was recorded as 25.8% Russian, 22.7% Polish, 6.6% Lithuanian.Robert Blobaum, Feliks Dzierzynski, The SDKPIL: a study of the origins of Polish Communism, p. 42 They established numerous schools and synagogues, and were important for centuries to the culture and business of the city. =Interwar Lithuania= Kaunas City Theatre, where the first session of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was held on 15 May 1920 Kaunas Garrison Officers' Club Kaunas during the early years of the interwar period with horse-drawn trams Lithuanian Air Force pilots with their ANBO 41 in Linksmadvaris aerodrome The Historical Presidential Palace President Antanas Smetona inspects the Lithuanian Army soldiers A Model 1:3 of Lituanica in Kaunas Soviet political leader (without military shoulder straps) and the People's Seimas member (with red rose in his jacket lapel) announces to the Lithuanian People's Army non- commissioned officers that \\"soon you will become members of the Red Army\\" in Kaunas, 1940 After Vilnius was occupied by the Russian Bolsheviks in 1919, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania established its main base in Kaunas. Later, when the capital Vilnius was annexed by Poland, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania, a position it held until 28 October 1939, when the Red Army handed Vilnius over to Lithuania. The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania first met in Kaunas on 15 May 1920. It passed some important laws, particularly on land reform, on the national currency, and adopted a new constitution. The military coup d'√©tat took place in Kaunas on 17 December 1926. It was largely organized by the military, especially general Povilas Plechaviƒçius, and resulted in the replacement of the democratically elected Government and President Kazys Grinius with a conservative nationalist authoritarian Government led by Antanas Smetona. Shortly afterwards, tension between Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras, supported by the Iron Wolf Association, arose seeking to gain authority. After an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1934, Augustinas Voldemaras was imprisoned for four years and received an amnesty on condition that he leave the country. During the interwar period, Kaunas was nicknamed as the Little Paris because of its rich cultural and academic life, fashion, Art Deco architecture, Lithuanian National Romanticism architectural style buildings as well as popular furniture, interior design of the time and widespread caf√© culture. The interim capital and the country itself also had a Western standard of living with sufficiently high salaries and low prices. At the time, qualified workers there were earning very similar real wages to workers in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France, the country also had a surprisingly high natural increase in population of 9.7 and the industrial production of Lithuania increased by 160% from 1913 to 1940. Between the World Wars industry prospered in Kaunas; it was then the largest city in Lithuania. Under the direction of the mayor Jonas Vilei≈°is (1921‚Äì1931) Kaunas grew rapidly and was extensively modernised. A water and waste water system, costing more than 15 million Lithuanian litas, was put in place, the city expanded from , more than 2,500 buildings were built, plus three modern bridges over the Neris and Nemunas rivers. All the city's streets were paved, horse-drawn transportation was replaced with modern bus lines, new suburbs were planned and built (≈Ωaliakalnis neighbourhood in particular), and new parks and squares were established. The foundations of a social security system were laid, three new schools were built, and new public libraries, including the Vincas Kudirka library, were established. J. Vilei≈°is maintained many contacts in other European cities, and as a result Kaunas was an active participant in European urban life. The city also was a particularly important center for the Lithuanian Armed Forces. In January 1919 during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, War School of Kaunas was established and started to train soldiers who were soon sent to the front to strengthen the fighting Lithuanian Army. Part of the Lithuanian armoured vehicles military unit was moved to ≈Ωaliakalnis, armed with advanced and brand new tanks, including the famous Renault FT, Vickers-Armstrong Model 1933 and Model 1936. In May 1919 Lithuanian Aircraft State Factory was founded in Freda to repair and to supply the army with military aircraft. It was considerably modernized by Antanas Gustaitis and started to build Lithuanian ANBO military aircraft. Due to the exceptional discipline and regularity the Lithuanian Air Force was an example for other military units. The ANBO 41 was far ahead of the most modern foreign reconnaissance aircraft of that time in structural features, and most importantly in speed and in rate of climb. At the time, Kaunas had a Jewish population of 35,000‚Äì40,000, about one-quarter of the city's total population. Jews made up much of the city's commercial, artisan, and professional sectors. Kaunas was a centre of Jewish learning, and the yeshiva in Slobodka (Vilijampolƒó) was one of Europe's most prestigious institutes of higher Jewish learning. Kaunas had a rich and varied Jewish culture. There were almost 100 Jewish organizations, 40 synagogues, many Yiddish schools, 4 Hebrew high schools, a Jewish hospital, and scores of Jewish-owned businesses. It was also an important Zionist centre. Initially prior to World War II, Lithuania declared neutrality. However, on 7 October 1939 the Lithuanian delegation departed to Moscow where they later had to sign the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty due to the unfavorable situation. The treaty resulted in five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops established across Lithuania in exchange for the Lithuania's historical capital Vilnius. According to the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Kazys Musteikis, Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb≈°ys initially told that Lithuanians refuses Vilnius Region as well as the Russian garrisons, however then nervous Joseph Stalin replied that \\"No matter if you take Vilnius or not, the Russian garrisons will enter Lithuania anyway\\". He also informed Juozas Urb≈°ys about the Soviet‚ÄìGerman secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. Two of the military bases with thousands of Soviet soldiers were established close to Kaunas in Prienai and Gai≈æi≈´nai. Despite regaining the beloved historical capital, the Presidency and the Government remained in Kaunas. On 14 June 1940 just before midnight, the last meeting of the Lithuanian Government was held in Kaunas. During it, the ultimatum presented by the Soviet Union was debated. President Antanas Smetona categorically declined to accept most of the ultimatum demands, argued for military resistance and was supported by Kazys Musteikis, Konstantinas ≈†akenis, Kazimieras Jokantas, however the Commander of the Armed Forces Vincas Vitkauskas, Divisional general Stasys Ra≈°tikis, Kazys Bizauskas, Antanas Merkys and most of the Lithuanian Government members decided that it would be impossible, especially due to the previously stationed Soviet soldiers, and accepted the ultimatum. On that night before officially accepting the ultimatum, the Soviet forces executed Lithuanian border guard near the Byelorussian SSR border. In the morning, the Lithuanian Government resigned while the president left the country to avoid the fate of the Soviet's puppet and hoping to form the Government in exile. Soon the Red Army flooded Lithuania through the Belarus‚ÄìLithuania border with more than 200,000 soldiers and took control of the most important cities, including Kaunas where the heads of state resided. The Lithuanian Armed Forces were ordered not to resist and the Lithuanian Air Force remained on the ground. At the time, the Lithuanian Armed Forces had 26,084 soldiers (of which 1,728 officers) and 2,031 civil servants. While the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, subordinate to the army commander, had over 62,000 members of which about 70% were farmers and agricultural workers. After the occupation, the Soviets immediately took brutal action against the high-ranking officials of the state. Both targets of the ultimatum: the Minister of the Interior Kazys Skuƒças and the Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania Augustinas Povilaitis were transported to Moscow and later executed. Antanas Gustaitis, Kazys Bizauskas, Vytautas Petrulis, Kazimieras Jokantas, Jonas Masili≈´nas, Antanas Tamo≈°aitis also faced the fate of execution, while President Aleksandras Stulginskis, Juozas Urb≈°ys, Leonas Bistras, Antanas Merkys, Pranas Dovydaitis, Petras Klimas, Donatas Malinauskas and thousands of others were deported. Stasys Ra≈°tikis, persuaded by his wife, secretly crossed the German border. After realizing this, NKVD started terror against the Ra≈°tikis family. His wife was separated from their 1-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated at Kaunas Prison, his old father Bernardas Ra≈°tikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia. Soldiers, officers, senior officers and generals of the Lithuanian Army and LRU members, who were seen as a threat to the occupiers, were quickly arrested, interrogated and released to the reserve, deported to the concentration camps or executed, trying to avoid this many joined the Lithuanian partisan forces. The army itself was initially renamed the Lithuanian People's Army; however, later it was reorganized into the 29th Rifle Corps of the Soviet Union. =Soviet occupation and the June Uprising= In June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania in accordance with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact.I. ≈Ωiemele.

Vladimir Dekanozov, a Soviet emissary from Moscow, gained effective power in Lithuania. Shortly afterwards, on 17 June 1940 the puppet People's Government of Lithuania was formed, which consistently destroyed Lithuanian society and political institutions and opened the way for the Communist Party to establish itself. In order to establish the legitimacy of the government and design the plans of Lithuania's \\"legal accession to the USSR\\", on 1 July, the Seimas of Lithuania was dismissed and elections to the puppet People's Seimas were announced. The controlled (passports had imprints) and falsified elections to the People's Seimas were won by the Lithuanian Labour People's Union, who obeyed the occupiers' proposal to \\"ask\\" the Soviet authorities to have Lithuania admitted to the Soviet Union.

In 1941, Kazys ≈†kirpa, Leonas Prapuolenis, Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius and their supporters, including the former Commander of the Lithuanian Army General Stasys Ra≈°tikis, whose whole family was deported to Siberia, began organizing an uprising. After realizing the reality of repressive and brutal Soviet rule, in the early morning of 22 June 1941 (the first day when the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union) Lithuanians began the June Uprising, organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front, in Kaunas where its main forces were concentrated. The uprising soon expanded to Vilnius and other locations. Its main goal was not to fight with the Soviets, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of 22 June, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, and radio station. The control of Vilnius and most of the Lithuania's territory was also shortly taken over by the rebels. Multiple Red Army divisions stationed around Kaunas, including the brutal 1st Motor Rifle Division NKVD responsible for the June deportation, and the puppet Lithuanian SSR regime commanders were forced to flee into the Latvian SSR through the Daugava river. The commander of the Red Army's 188th Rifle Division colonel Piotr Ivanov reported to the 11th Army Staff that during the retreat of his division through Kaunas \\"local counterrevolutionaries from the shelters deliberately fired on the Red Army, the detachments suffering heavy losses of soldiers and military equipment\\". About 5,000 occupants were killed in Lithuania. On 23 June 1941 at 9:28 am Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó, the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem with tears in their eyes. From Kaunas radio broadcasts, Lithuania learned that the rebellion was taking place in the country, the insurgents took Kaunas, the Proclamation of the Independence Restoration of Lithuania and the list of the Provisional Government was announced by Leonas Prapuolenis. The message was being repeated several times in different languages. The Provisional Government hoped that the Germans would re-establish Lithuanian independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic), was seeking the protection of its citizens and did not support the Nazis' Holocaust policy. But the Provisional Government did little to stop the anti-Jewish violence encouraged by the Nazis and the anti-Semitic leadership of the Lithuanian Activist Front.Su≈æiedƒólis, Saulius. \\"The Burden of 1941\\". Lituanus Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences, Volume 47, No. 4 (Winter 2001). Minister of National Defence General Stasys Ra≈°tikis met personally with the Nazi Germany Generals to discuss the situation. He approached the Kaunas War Field Commandant General Oswald Pohl and the Military Command Representative General Karl von Roques by trying to plead for him to spare the Jews, however they replied that the Gestapo is handling these issues and that they cannot help. Furthermore, in the beginning of the occupation, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Lithuania Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius convened the meeting in which the ministers participated together with the former President Kazys Grinius, Bishop Vincentas Brizgys and others. Ministers expressed distress at the atrocities being committed against the Jews, but advised only that \\"despite all the measures which must be taken against the Jews for their Communist activity and harm done to the German Army, partisans and individuals should avoid public executions of Jews.\\" According to Lithuanian-American Holocaust historian Saulius Su≈æiedƒólis, \\"none of this amounted to a public scolding which alone could have persuaded at least some of the Lithuanians who had volunteered or been co-opted into participating in the killings to rethink their behavior.\\" Lithuanian police battalions formed by the Provisional Government were eventually enlisted by the Nazis to help carry out the Holocaust. In the first issue of the daily ƒÆ laisvƒô (Towards Freedom) newspaper, the Independence Restoration Declaration was published, which had been previously announced on the radio. It stated that \\"The established Provisional Government of revived Lithuania declares the restoration of the Free and Independent State of Lithuania. The young Lithuanian state enthusiastically pledges to contribute to the organization of Europe on a new basis in front of the whole world innocent conscience. The Lithuanian Nation, exhausted from the terror of the brutal Bolshevism, decided to build its future on the basis of national unity and social justice.\\" and signatures. On 24 June 1941, tank units of the Red Army in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The rebels radioed the Germans for assistance. The units were bombed by the Luftwaffe and did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian‚ÄìGerman action. The first German scouts, lieutenant Flohret and four privates, entered Kaunas on 24 June and found it in friendly hands. A day later the main forces marched into the city without obstruction and almost as if they were on parade. =Nazi occupation= Wehrmacht soldiers marching through the Liberty Avenue in Kaunas On 26 June 1941 the German military command ordered the rebel groups to disband and disarm. Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties. Already in July, in a conversation the Tilsit Nazi Gestapo agent Dr Heinz Gr√§fe clearly stated to Stasys Ra≈°tikis that the Provisional Government was formed without German knowledge. Such a form, although not having anything against individuals, is unacceptable to the Germans. The current Provisional Government should be transformed into a National Committee or Council under the German military authority. The Nazi Germans did not recognize the new Provisional Government, but they did not take any action to dissolve it. The Provisional Government, not agreeing to continue to be an instrument of the German occupiers, disbanded itself on 5 August 1941 after signing a protest for the Germans action of suspending the Lithuanian Government powers. Members of the Provisional Government then went as a body to the Garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum, where they laid a wreath near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the presence of numerous audience. The Sicherheitsdienst confiscated the pictures of the wreath-laying ceremony, thinking that it could be dangerous for the German occupation policy in Lithuania. On 17 July 1941 the German civil administration was established. The government's powers were taken over by the new occupants. Nazi Germany established the Reichskommissariat Ostland in the Baltic states and much of Belarus, and the administrative centre for Lithuania (Generalbezirk Litauen) was in Kaunas ruled by a Generalkommissar Adrian von Renteln.Kay, Alex J.

Berghahn Books. =Jewish community of Kaunas= Kaunas Choral Synagogue Jews began settling in Kaunas in the second half of the 17th century. They were not allowed to live in the city, so most of them stayed in the Vilijampolƒó settlement on the right bank of the Neris river. Jewish life in Kaunas was first disrupted when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940. The occupation was accompanied by arrests, confiscations, and the elimination of all free institutions. Jewish community organizations disappeared almost overnight. Soviet authorities confiscated the property of many Jews, while hundreds were exiled to Siberia. Chiune Sugihara House in Kaunas Right before the Second World War began, there were 30,000 Jews living in Kaunas, comprising about 25% of the city's population. When the Soviet Union took over Lithuania in 1940, some Jewish Dutch residents in Lithuania approached the Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk to get a visa to the Dutch West Indies. Zwartendijk agreed to help them and Jews who had fled from German-occupied Poland also sought his assistance. In a few days, with the help of aides, Zwartendijk produced over 2,200 visas for Jews to Cura√ßao. Then refugees approached Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese consul, who gave them a transit visa through the USSR to Japan, against the disapproval of his government. This gave many refugees an opportunity to leave Lithuania for the Far East via the Trans-Siberian railway. The fleeing Jews were refugees from German-occupied Western Poland and Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland, as well as residents of Kaunas and other Lithuania territories. The Sugihara House, where he was previously issuing transit visas, currently is a museum and the Centre For Asian Studies of Vytautas Magnus University. Following Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Soviet forces fled from Kaunas. Both before and during the German occupation starting 25 June, the anti-Communists, encouraged by the anti-Semitic leadership of the Berlin-based Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), began to attack Jews, blaming them for the Soviet repressions, especially along Jurbarko and Kri≈°ƒçiukaiƒçio streets. The LAF's manifesto-type essay \\"What Are the Activists Fighting for?\\" states: \\"The Lithuanian Activist Front, by restoring the new Lithuania, is determined to carry out an immediate and fundamental purging of the Lithuanian nation and its land of Jews ...\\". Nazi authorities took advantage of the Lithuanian TDA Battalions and established a concentration camp at the Seventh Fort, one of the city's ten historic forts, and 4,000 Jews were rounded up and murdered there. The Kaunas pogrom was a massacre of Jewish people living in Kaunas, Lithuania that took place on 25‚Äì29 June 1941‚Äîthe first days of the Operation Barbarossa and of Nazi occupation of Lithuania. Prior to the construction of the Ninth Fort museum on the site, archaeologists unearthed a mass grave and personal belongings of the Jewish victims. The Ninth Fortress has been renovated into a memorial for the wars and is the site where nearly 50,000 Lithuanians were killed during Nazi occupation. Of these deaths, over 30,000 were Jews. =Soviet administration= Romas Kalanta set himself on fire close to Kaunas State Musical Theatre protesting against the Soviet regime Vienybƒós aik≈°tƒó (Unity Square) monument with eternal flame Vytautas the Great War Museum Beginning in 1944, the Red Army began offensives that eventually led to the reconquest of all three of the Baltic states. Kaunas again became the major centre of resistance against the Soviet regime. From the very start of the Lithuanian partisans war, the most important partisan districts were based around Kaunas. Although guerrilla warfare ended by 1953, Lithuanian opposition to Soviet rule did not. In 1956 people in the Kaunas region supported the uprising in Hungary by rioting. On All Souls' Day in 1956, the first public anti-Soviet protest rally took place in Kaunas: citizens burned candles in the Kaunas military cemetery and sang national songs, resulting in clashes with the Militsiya. On 14 May 1972, 19-year-old Romas Kalanta, having proclaimed \\"Freedom for Lithuania!\\", immolated himself in the garden of the Musical Theatre, after making a speech denouncing the Soviet suppression of national and religious rights. The event broke into a politically charged riot, which was forcibly dispersed by the KGB and Militsiya. It led to new forms of resistance: passive resistance all around Lithuania. The continuous oppression of the Catholic Church and its resistance caused the appearance of the Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania. In strict conspiracy, Catholic priest Sigitas Tamkeviƒçius (now the Archbishop Metropolitan of Kaunas) implemented this idea and its first issue was published in the Alytus district on 19 March 1972. The Kronika started a new phase of resistance in the life of Lithuania's Catholic Church and of all Lithuania fighting against the occupation by making known to the world the violation of the human rights and freedoms in Lithuania for almost two decades. On 1 November 1987, a non- sanctioned rally took place near the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica, where people gathered to mark famous Lithuanian poet Maironis' 125th-birthday anniversary. On 10 June 1988, the initiating group of the Kaunas movement of SƒÖj≈´dis was formed. On 9 October 1988, the Flag of Lithuania was raised above the tower of the Military Museum. Kaunas, along with Vilnius, became the scene of nearly constant demonstrations as the Lithuanians, embarked on a process of self- discovery. The bodies of Lithuanians who died in Siberian exile were brought back to their homeland for reburial, and the anniversaries of deportations as well as the important dates in Lithuanian history began to be noted with speeches and demonstrations. On 16 February 1989 Cardinal Vincentas Sladkeviƒçius, for the first time, called for the independence of Lithuania in his sermon at the Kaunas Cathedral. After the services, 200,000 persons gathered in the centre of Kaunas to participate in the dedication of a new monument to freedom to replace the monument that had been torn down by the Soviet authorities after World War II. = Restored independence = Caf√©s in the Kaunas Old Town After World War II Kaunas became the main industrial city of Lithuania‚Äîit produced about a quarter of Lithuania's industrial output. After the proclamation of Lithuanian independence in 1990, Soviet attempts to suppress the rebellion focused on the Sitk≈´nai Radio Station. They were defended by the citizenry of Kaunas. Kaunas. Facts&History.; Pope John Paul II said Holy Mass for the faithful of the Archdiocese of Kaunas at the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica and held a meeting with the young people of Lithuania at the S. Darius and S. Girƒónas Stadium, during his visit to Lithuania in 1993. Kaunas natives Vytautas Landsbergis and Valdas Adamkus became the Head of state in 1990, and, respectively, in 1998 and 2004. Since the restoration of independence, improving substantially air and land transport links with Western Europe have made Kaunas easily accessible to foreign tourists. Kaunas is famous for its legendary basketball club ≈Ωalgiris, which was founded in 1944 and was one of the most popular nonviolent expressions of resistance during its struggle with the CSKA Moscow. In 2011, the largest indoor arena in the Baltic states was built and was named ≈Ωalgiris Arena. Kaunas hosted finals of the widely appreciated EuroBasket 2011.

The Old Town is the historical center of Kaunas. The streets in Old Town have been turned to pedestrian sidewalks, so it is best to tour the place by foot. Prominent features of the Old Town include Kaunas Castle, the Town Hall, and the historical Presidential Palace. The Town Hall in Kaunas played an important role in the Medieval Times as a center for trade, festivals, and criminals were brought here for punishment. The Town Hall was originally built with wooden frames, however, after numerous fires in 1542 they began to construct buildings with stone. The stone buildings, however, also burned down so the Town Hall that stands today was constructed in a more advanced way, which took from 1771 to 1780. The Town Hall is still a center of culture today, it holds weddings and is the home of the Museum of Ceramics.

During the Gothic period, the Kaunas Castle (13th‚Äì16th centuries), Old Kaunas Ducal Palace (15th century), Church of Vytautas the Great (beginning of the 15th century; also known as the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary), Church of Saint Nicholas (late 15th century), St. George's Church and the Bernardine Monastery (1472), Church of St. Gertrude (15th‚Äì16th centuries; also has Renaissance elements), Kaunas Cathedral Basilica (construction began in the 15th century; later was reconstructed and expanded), Kaunas Town Hall (construction began in 1542; later gained late Baroque and early Classicism forms), House of Perk≈´nas (late 15th century ‚Äì early 16th century), residential houses in the Town Hall Square, Vilnius and Kurpi≈≥ Streets were built. The ensemble of the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Bernardine monastery (started in the late 16th century), the so-called Napoleonic House (16th century) has Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Mannerist architecture features. The Renaissance remains of Kaunas defensive fortifications have survived (2nd half of the 17th century).

From 1918 to 1940 more than 12.000 construction permits were issued in Kaunas, which was an extremely rapid growth for a relatively small-scale city (90.000 inhabitants) that fundamentally changed the city's character. Neoclassicism prevailed in the 3rd decade of the 20th century (Kaunas School of Arts, built in 1923, Bank of Lithuania building, built in 1928, Palace of Justice and the Parliament with Art Deco elements, built in 1930) and a search for the Lithuanian national style was typical (e.g. residential house of Ragutis factory, built in 1925). The styles of Classicism and Modernism intertwined in buildings built in the beginning of 1930s (e.g. Faculty of Medicine at Vytautas Magnus University, built in 1933, now belongs to the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Vytautas the Great War Museum and M. K. ƒåiurlionis National Art Museum, built in 1936), while Modernism and national style intertwined in the Kaunas Central Post Office (architect F.

After World War II buildings of pseudoclassical forms were built (e.g. Kaunas railway station, built in 1953), complex engineering structures (Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant, built in 1960). From the 7th decade of the 20th century Modernism style buildings were further developed. New residential areas were built (e.g. Kalnieƒçiai, completed in 1985), public buildings (e.g. Industrial Construction Design Institute, 1966, House for Political Education (now part of Vytautas Magnus University), 1976), shopping malls (e.g. Girstupis, 1975, Vitebskas, 1980, Kalnieƒçi≈≥, 1986), shops (Vie≈°nagƒó, 1982, Merkurijus, 1983), galleries (e.g. Kaunas Picture Gallery, 1978, Mykolas ≈Ωilinskas Art Gallery, 1989), educational institutions (e.g. Faculty of Light Industry at Kaunas University of Technology, 1983). In the late 20th century and early 21st century, buildings were built in Kaunas based on the projects of architects V. Adomaviƒçius (e.g. ƒÑ≈æuolynas Sports Center Complex, 2003), G. Jureviƒçius (e.g. Peugeot, Toyota, Lexus, Honda car showrooms), A.

It is an example of anti-humor, in that the curious setup of the joke leads the listener to expect a traditional punchline, but they are instead given a simple statement of fact. \\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\\" has become iconic as an exemplary generic joke to which most people know the answer, and has been repeated and changed numerous times over the course of history.  History  An 1847 version of the joke (The Knickerbocker) The riddle appeared in an 1847 edition of The Knickerbocker, a New York City monthly magazine:The Knickerbocker, or The New York Monthly, March 1847, p. 283. > There are 'quips and quillets' which seem actual conundrums, but yet are > none. Of such is this: 'Why does a chicken cross the street?['] Are you 'out > of town?' Do you 'give it up?' Well, then: 'Because it wants to get on the > other side!' In the 1890s, a pun variant version appeared in the magazine Potter's American Monthly:Potter's American Monthly (1892), p. 319. > Why should not a chicken cross the road? It would be a fowl proceeding.  Variations  A chicken crossing Yunnan Provincial Road 214 There are many riddles that assume a familiarity with this well-known riddle and its answer. For example, an alternate punchline can be used for the riddle, such as \\"it was too far to walk around\\". One class of variations enlists a creature other than the chicken to cross the road, in order to refer back to the original riddle. For example, a duck (or turkey) crosses \\"because it was the chicken's day off,\\" and a dinosaur crosses \\"because chickens didn't exist yet.\\" Some variants are both puns and references to the original, such as \\"Why did the duck cross the road?\\" \\"To prove he's no chicken\\". Other variations replace side with another word often to form a pun. Some examples are: > \\" \\"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the idiot's house\\". Which > is then followed by a knock knock joke: \\"Knock knock\\", \\"Who's there?\\" \\"The > chicken\\".\\" \\"Why did the chicken cross the playground?

A member of the Minamoto samurai clan, Minamoto no Yoritomo was his cousin and rival during the Genpei War between the Minamoto and the Taira clans. Yoshinaka was born in Musashi province. His Dharma name was Tokuon'in Gisan Senk≈ç (Âæ≥Èü≥Èô¢Áæ©Â±±ÂÆ£ÂÖ¨). Yoshinaka's father, Minamoto no Yoshikata, was killed by Minamoto no Yoshihira in 1155. Yoshihira sought to kill Yoshinaka also, but the latter escaped to Shinano Province. He was raised with Nakahara Shiro who was his milk brother (Shiro's mother Chizuru nursed both Yoshinaka and Shiro). This Shiro would later become Imai Kanehira, Yoshinaka's best friend and most loyal retainer. Yoshinaka later changed his name from Minamoto to , to reflect the Kiso Mountains where he was raised. In 1181, Yoshinaka received Prince Mochihito's call to the members of the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira. Yoshinaka entered the Genpei War raising an army and invading Echigo Province. He then defeated a Taira force sent to pacify the area. In 1183 a Taira army captured Hiuchi. In 1183, Yoshinaka was confronted by Minamoto no Yoritomo, whose army had entered Shinano. The two reconciled and resolved to unite against the Taira. Yoshinaka then sent his son to Kamakura as a hostage. However, having been shamed, Yoshinaka was now determined to beat Yoritomo to Kyoto, defeat the Taira on his own, and take control of the Minamoto for himself. Yoshinaka defeated the army of Taira no Koremori at the Battle of Kurikara Pass and marched to Kyoto. The Taira retreated out of the capital, taking the child Emperor Antoku with them. Yoshinaka's army entered the capital with the cloistered Emperor Go- Shirakawa. Go-Shirakawa then issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to join with Yukiiye in \\"destroying Munemori and his army\\". The emperor bestowed upon Yoshinaka the title of Asahi Sh≈çgun (). Yoshinaka plotted with Yukiie in \\"setting up a government in their own northern province\\". Learning Go- Shirakawa had sought help from his cousin Yoritomo, Yoshinaka seized the cloistered emperor and burned his palace. Yoritomo ordered his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to destroy Yoshinaka. Yoshinaka was driven out of Kyoto and killed by his cousins at the Battle of Awazu in ≈åmi Province (present-day Shiga Prefecture) along with Kanehira. With night coming and with many enemy soldiers chasing him, he attempted to find an isolated spot to kill himself. However, the story says that his horse became trapped in a field of partly frozen mud and his enemies were able to approach him and kill him. He was buried in ≈åtsu, in ≈åmi; a temple was built in his honor during the later Muromachi period. Its name, Gich≈´-ji, has the same two kanji as his given name. Kanehira's grave is also in Otsu, but it is not close to Yoshinaka's. The Edo period poet Matsuo Bash≈ç, pursuant to his last wishes, was buried next to Minamoto no Yoshinaka in Gich≈´-ji. Minamoto no Yoshinaka is one of many main characters in the Kamakura period epic, the Tale of Heike. The story of Yoshinaka and Kanehira is fairly well known in Japan; it is also the subject of the Noh play Kanehira, in which Kanehira's tormented ghost describes his and Yoshinaka's death, and his wish to go to the other side.

As with other sub-disciplines that have prefixed 'computational' to their name (e.g. computational biology, computational physics and computational sociology), the term is reserved for (generally mathematical) methods that could not realistically be performed without the aid of a computer. Computational archaeology may include the use of geographical information systems (GIS), especially when applied to spatial analyses such as viewshed analysis and least-cost path analysis as these approaches are sufficiently computationally complex that they are extremely difficult if not impossible to implement without the processing power of a computer. Likewise, some forms of statistical and mathematical modelling, and the computer simulation of human behaviour and behavioural evolution using software tools such as Swarm or Repast would also be impossible to calculate without computational aid. The application of a variety of other forms of complex and bespoke software to solve archaeological problems, such as human perception and movement within built environments using software such as University College London's Space Syntax program, also falls under the term 'computational archaeology'. The acquisition, documentation and analysis of archaeological finds at excavations and in museums is an important field having pottery analysis as one of the major topics. In this area 3D-acquisition techniques like Structured Light Scanning (SLS), photogrammetric methods like Structure from Motion (SfM), Computed Tomography as well as their combinations provide large data-sets of numerous objects for digital pottery research. These techniques are increasingly integrated into the in-situ workflow of excavations. The Austrian subproject of the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum (CVA) is seminal for digital research on finds within museums. Computational archaeology is also known as archaeological informatics (Burenhult 2002, Huggett and Ross 2004) or archaeoinformatics (sometimes abbreviated as \\"AI\\", but not to be confused with artificial intelligence).  Origins and objectives  In recent years, it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process. AI science is an emerging discipline that attempts to uncover, quantitatively represent and explore specific properties and patterns of archaeological information. Fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding. AI science is capable of complementing and enhancing almost any area of scientific archaeological research. It incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in quantitative archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures. This opens archaeological analysis to a wide range of computer-based information processing methods fit to solve problems of great complexity. It also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines, both in methods and software technology. Its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other: #Fundamental research (theoretical AI science) on the structure, properties and possibilities of archaeological data, inference and knowledge building. This includes modeling and managing fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data, scale effects, optimal sampling strategies and spatio-temporal effects. #Development of computer algorithms and software (applied AI science) that make this theoretical knowledge available to the user. There is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology. The development of methods and applications is best reflected in the annual publications of the CAA conference (see external links section at bottom). At least two journals, the Italian Archeologia e Calcolatori and the British Archaeological Computing Newsletter, are dedicated to archaeological computing methods. AI Science contributes to many fundamental research topics, including but not limited to: * advanced statistics in archaeology, spatial and temporal archaeological data analysis * bayesian analysis and advanced probability models, fuzziness and uncertainty in archaeological data * scale-related phenomena and scale transgressions * intrasite analysis (representations of stratigraphy, 3D analysis, artefact distributions) * landscape analysis (territorial modeling, visibility analysis) * optimal survey and sampling strategies * process-based modeling and simulation models * archaeological predictive modeling and heritage management applications * supervised and unsupervised classification and typology, artificial intelligence applications * digital excavations and virtual reality * computational reproducibility of archaeological research * archaeological software development, electronic data sharing and publishing AI science advocates a formalized approach to archaeological inference and knowledge building. It is interdisciplinary in nature, borrowing, adapting and enhancing method and theory from numerous other disciplines such as computer science (e.g. algorithm and software design, database design and theory), geoinformation science (spatial statistics and modeling, geographic information systems), artificial intelligence research (supervised classification, fuzzy logic), ecology (point pattern analysis), applied mathematics (graph theory, probability theory) and statistics.  Training and research  Scientific progress in archaeology, as in any other discipline, requires building abstract, generalized and transferable knowledge about the processes that underlie past human actions and their manifestations. Quantification provides the ultimate known way of abstracting and extending our scientific abilities past the limits of intuitive cognition. Quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research. They provide the tools, algebra, statistics and computer algorithms, to process information too voluminous or complex for purely cognitive, informal inference. They also build a bridge between archaeology and numerous quantitative sciences such as geophysics, geoinformation sciences and applied statistics. And they allow archaeological scientists to design and carry out research in a formal, transparent and comprehensible way. Being an emerging field of research, AI science is currently a rather dispersed discipline in need of stronger, well-funded and institutionalized embedding, especially in academic teaching. Despite its evident progress and usefulness, today's quantitative archaeology is often inadequately represented in archaeological training and education. Part of this problem may be misconceptions about the seeming conflict between mathematics and humanistic archaeology. Nevertheless, digital excavation technology, modern heritage management and complex research issues require skilled students and researchers to develop new, efficient and reliable means of processing an ever-growing mass of untackled archaeological data and research problems. Thus, providing students of archaeology with a solid background in quantitative sciences such as mathematics, statistics and computer sciences seems today more important than ever. Currently, universities based in the UK provide the largest share of study programmes for prospective quantitative archaeologists, with more institutes in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands developing a strong profile quickly. In Germany, the country's first lecturer's position in AI science (\\"Arch√§oinformatik\\") was established in 2005 at the University of Kiel (Benjamin Ducke, now at Oxford Archaeology), while currently there is only one regular junior professorship in Archaeoinformatics in the field of Classical Archaeology at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. From April 2016 a new full professorship in Archaeoinformatics will be established at the University of Cologne (Institute of Archaeology). The most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and AI science is the international conference on Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of Europe each year. Vienna's city archaeology unit also hosts an annual event that is quickly growing in international importance (see links at bottom).

It is also called Phong interpolation, or normal-vector interpolation shading. It interpolates surface normals across rasterized polygons and computes pixel colors based on the interpolated normals and a reflection model. Phong shading may also refer to the specific combination of Phong interpolation and the Phong reflection model.  History  Phong shading and the Phong reflection model were developed at the University of Utah by Bui Tuong Phong, who published them in his 1973 Ph.D dissertationBui Tuong Phong, Illumination of Computer-Generated Images, Department of Computer Science, University of Utah, UTEC-CSs-73-129, July 1973.University of Utah School of Computing, History and a 1975 paper.Bui Tuong Phong, \\"Illumination for Computer Generated Pictures,\\" Comm. ACM, Vol 18(6):311-317, June 1975. Phong's methods were considered radical at the time of their introduction, but have since become the de facto baseline shading method for many rendering applications. Phong's methods have proven popular due to their generally efficient use of computation time per rendered pixel.  Phong interpolation  Phong shading improves upon Gouraud shading and provides a better approximation of the shading of a smooth surface. Phong shading assumes a smoothly varying surface normal vector. The Phong interpolation method works better than Gouraud shading when applied to a reflection model that has small specular highlights such as the Phong reflection model. The most serious problem with Gouraud shading occurs when specular highlights are found in the middle of a large polygon. Since these specular highlights are absent from the polygon's vertices and Gouraud shading interpolates based on the vertex colors, the specular highlight will be missing from the polygon's interior. This problem is fixed by Phong shading. Unlike Gouraud shading, which interpolates colors across polygons, in Phong shading a normal vector is linearly interpolated across the surface of the polygon from the polygon's vertex normals. The surface normal is interpolated and normalized at each pixel and then used in a reflection model, e.g. the Phong reflection model, to obtain the final pixel color. Phong shading is more computationally expensive than Gouraud shading since the reflection model must be computed at each pixel instead of at each vertex. In modern graphics hardware, variants of this algorithm are implemented using pixel or fragment shaders.  Phong reflection model  Phong shading may also refer to the specific combination of Phong interpolation and the Phong reflection model, which is an empirical model of local illumination. It describes the way a surface reflects light as a combination of the diffuse reflection of rough surfaces with the specular reflection of shiny surfaces. It is based on Bui Tuong Phong's informal observation that shiny surfaces have small intense specular highlights, while dull surfaces have large highlights that fall off more gradually. The reflection model also includes an ambient term to account for the small amount of light that is scattered about the entire scene. Visual illustration of the Phong equation: here the light is white, the ambient and diffuse colors are both blue, and the specular color is white, reflecting a small part of the light hitting the surface, but only in very narrow highlights. The intensity of the diffuse component varies with the direction of the surface, and the ambient component is uniform (independent of direction).

Bump maps achieve this effect by changing how an illuminated surface reacts to light, without modifying the size or shape of the surface. Bump mapping is a texture mapping technique in computer graphics for simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object. This is achieved by perturbing the surface normals of the object and using the perturbed normal during lighting calculations. The result is an apparently bumpy surface rather than a smooth surface although the surface of the underlying object is not changed. Bump mapping was introduced by James Blinn in 1978.Blinn, James F. \\"Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces\\", Computer Graphics, Vol. 12 (3), pp. 286-292 SIGGRAPH- ACM (August 1978) Normal mapping is the most common variation of bump mapping used. Bump mapping basics Bump mapping is limited in that it does not modify the shape of the underlying object. On the left, a mathematical function defining a bump map simulates a crumbling surface on a sphere, but the object's outline and shadow remain those of a perfect sphere. On the right, the same function is used to modify the surface of a sphere by generating an isosurface. This models a sphere with a bumpy surface with the result that both its outline and its shadow are rendered realistically. Bump mapping is a technique in computer graphics to make a rendered surface look more realistic by simulating small displacements of the surface. However, unlike displacement mapping, the surface geometry is not modified. Instead only the surface normal is modified as if the surface had been displaced. The modified surface normal is then used for lighting calculations (using, for example, the Phong reflection model) giving the appearance of detail instead of a smooth surface. Bump mapping is much faster and consumes less resources for the same level of detail compared to displacement mapping because the geometry remains unchanged. There are also extensions which modify other surface features in addition to increasing the sense of depth. Parallax mapping is one such extension. The primary limitation with bump mapping is that it perturbs only the surface normals without changing the underlying surface itself.Real-Time Bump Map Synthesis, Jan Kautz1, Wolfgang Heidrichy2 and Hans-Peter Seidel1, (1Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Informatik, 2University of British Columbia) Silhouettes and shadows therefore remain unaffected, which is especially noticeable for larger simulated displacements. This limitation can be overcome by techniques including displacement mapping where bumps are applied to the surface or using an isosurface. =Methods= There are two primary methods to perform bump mapping. The first uses a height map for simulating the surface displacement yielding the modified normal. This is the method invented by Blinn and is usually what is referred to as bump mapping unless specified. The steps of this method are summarized as follows. Before a lighting calculation is performed for each visible point (or pixel) on the object's surface: # Look up the height in the heightmap that corresponds to the position on the surface. # Calculate the surface normal of the heightmap, typically using the finite difference method. # Combine the surface normal from step two with the true (\\"geometric\\") surface normal so that the combined normal points in a new direction. # Calculate the interaction of the new \\"bumpy\\" surface with lights in the scene using, for example, the Phong reflection model. The result is a surface that appears to have real depth. The algorithm also ensures that the surface appearance changes as lights in the scene are moved around. The other method is to specify a normal map which contains the modified normal for each point on the surface directly. Since the normal is specified directly instead of derived from a height map this method usually leads to more predictable results. This makes it easier for artists to work with, making it the most common method of bump mapping today. Realtime bump mapping techniques thumbright400pxExample of a realtime fake bump mapping. From left: 1. surface bitmap, intentionally blurry, 2. source of light bitmap, 3. bump mapping effect with light source orbiting 1=x^2+y^2/x^2 trajectory. Realtime 3D graphics programmers often use variations of the technique in order to simulate bump mapping at a lower computational cost. One typical way was to use a fixed geometry, which allows one to use the heightmap surface normal almost directly. Combined with a precomputed lookup table for the lighting calculations the method could be implemented with a very simple and fast loop, allowing for a full-screen effect. This method was a common visual effect when bump mapping was first introduced.

It is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a British Crown dependency. It is long and wide. The area is , making it the third- largest island of the Channel Islands, and the second largest in the Bailiwick. It is around to the west of the La Hague on the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, in France, to the north-east of Guernsey and from the south coast of Great Britain. It is the closest of the Channel Islands to France and to the United Kingdom. It is separated from Cap de la Hague by the dangerous Alderney Race (French: Raz Blanchard). As of 2018, the island had a population of 2,039; natives are traditionally nicknamed vaquesDictionnaire Jersiais- Fran√ßais, 1966; Customs, Ceremonies & Traditions of the Channel Islands, Lempri√®re, 1976, after the cows, or else lapinsDictionnaire Jersiais- Fran√ßais, 1966 after the many rabbits seen in the island. Formally, they are known as Ridunians, from the Latin Riduna. The only parish of Alderney is the parish of St Anne, which covers the whole island. The main town, St Anne, historically known as La Ville (\\"The Town\\"), is often referred to as \\"St Anne's\\" by visitors and incomers, but rarely by locals (who, in normal conversation, still most frequently refer to the area centred on Victoria Street simply as \\"Town\\"). The town's \\"High Street\\", which formerly had a small handful of shops, is now almost entirely residential, forming a T-junction with Victoria Street at its highest point. The town area features an imposing church and an unevenly cobbled main street: Victoria Street (Rue Grosnez ‚Äì the English name being adopted on the visit of Queen Victoria in 1854). There is one school (providing both primary and secondary education), a post office, and hotels, as well as restaurants, banks and shops. Other settlements include Braye, Crabby, Longis, Mannez, La Banque, and Newtown.  History  Alderney shares its prehistory with the other islands in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, becoming an island in the Neolithic period as the waters of the Channel rose. Formerly rich in dolmens, like the other Channel Islands, Alderney with its heritage of megaliths has suffered through the large-scale military constructions of the 19th century and also by the Germans during the World War II occupation, who left the remains at Les Pourciaux unrecognisable as dolmens. A cist survives near Fort Tourgis, and Longis Common has remains of an Iron Age site. There are traces of Roman occupationA Visitor's Guide to Guernsey, Alderney and Sark\\", Victor Coysh, 1983 including a fort, built in the late 300s, at above the island's only natural harbour.\\"Alderney ruin found to be Roman fort\\", BBC News, 25 November 2011, accessed 7 December 2011.Nicholas Hogben, \\"ALDERNEY‚ÄôS ‚ÄòSHORE FORT‚Äô\\": \\"My best guess is that the outer structure was constructed in the second half of the third century or later by the Roman navy around an existing combined harbour master's and revenue office, perhaps to protect it, and hence the island, from the ‚Äòpirates‚Äô that Carausius hunted.\\" THE ASSOCIATION FOR ROMAN ARCHAEOLOGY Newsletter no. 23, not dated. The etymology of the island's name is obscure. It is known in Latin as Riduna but as with the names of all the Channel Islands in the Roman period there is a degree of confusion. Riduna may be the original name of Tatihou, while Alderney is conjectured to be identified with Sarnia. Alderney/Aurigny is variously supposed to be a Germanic or Celtic name. It may be a corruption of Adreni or Alrene, which is probably derived from an Old Norse word meaning \\"island near the coast\\". Alternatively it may derive from three Norse elements: alda (swelling wave, roller), renna (strong current, race) and √∂y or -ey (island). Alderney may be mentioned in Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum (I.6) as 'Evodia' in which he discussed a certain dangerous whirlpool. The name 'Evodia' may in turn originate from the seven 'Haemodae' of uncertain identification in Pliny the Elder's Natural History (IV 16 (30) or Pomponius Mela's Chronographia (III 6,54). Along with the other Channel Islands, Alderney was annexed by the Duchy of Normandy in 933. In 1042 William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy (later William the Conqueror, King of the English) granted Alderney to the Abbey of Mont Saint- Michel. In 1057 the bishop of Coutances took back control of the island. After 1204, when mainland Normandy was incorporated into the kingdom of France, Alderney remained loyal to the English monarch in his dignity of Duke of Normandy. Henry VIII of England undertook fortification works, but these ceased in 1554. Essex Castle perpetuates the name of the Earl of Essex, who purchased the governorship of Alderney in 1591. Prior to the Earl's execution for treason in 1601, he leased the island to William Chamberlain, and Alderney remained in the hands of the Chamberlain family until 1643. From 1612, a Judge was appointed to assist the Governor's administration of Alderney, along with the Jurats. The function of the Judge was similar to that of the Bailiffs of Guernsey and Jersey, and continued until 1949. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Alderney was held by a Parliamentary garrison under Nicholas Ling, Lieutenant-Governor. Ling built Government House (now the Island Hall). The de Carterets of Jersey acquired the governorship, later passing it to Sir Edmund Andros of Guernsey, from whom the Guernsey family of Le Mesurier inherited it, thus establishing a hereditary line of governors that lasted until 1825. Henry Le Mesurier prospered through privateering, and moved the harbour from Longis to Braye, building a jetty there in 1736. Warehouses and dwellings were built at Braye, and the export of cattle generated wealth for the economy. The Court House was built in 1770 and a school in 1790. A Methodist chapel was constructed in 1790, following John Wesley's visit in 1787. An Optical telegraph tower was constructed above La Foul√®re in 1811, enabling signals to be relayed visually to Le M√¢t in Sark and on to Guernsey ‚Äì early warning of attack during the Napoleonic Wars was of strategic importance. With the end of those wars privateering was ended and smuggling suppressed, leading to economic difficulties. The last of the hereditary Governors, John Le Mesurier, resigned his patent to the Crown in 1825, and since then authority has been exercised by the States of Alderney, as amended by the constitutional settlement of 1948. = Victorian era = The British Government decided to undertake massive fortifications in the 19th century and to create a strategic harbour to deter attacks from France.Davenport, T.G., Partridge CW, \\"The Victorian Fortification of Alderney\\", Fort (Fortress Study Group), 1980, (8), pp21-47 These fortifications were presciently described by William Ewart Gladstone as \\"a monument of human folly, useless to us ... but perhaps not absolutely useless to a possible enemy, with whom we may at some period have to deal and who may possibly be able to extract some profit in the way of shelter and accommodation from the ruins.\\" An influx of English and Irish labourers, plus the sizeable British garrison stationed in the island, led to rapid Anglicisation. The harbour was never completed ‚Äì the remaining breakwater (designed by James Walker) is one of the island's landmarks, and is longer than any breakwater in the UK. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited Alderney on 9 August 1854.Portrait of the Channel Islands, Lempri√®re, London 1970 The Albert Memorial and the renaming of Rue Grosnez to Victoria Street commemorate this visit. At the same time as the breakwater was being built in the 1850s, the island was fortified by a string of 13 forts, designed to protect the harbour of refuge. The accommodation quarters of several of the forts have been converted into apartments; two are now private homes; and one, Fort Clonque, at the end of a causeway that can be flooded at high tide, belongs to the Landmark Trust and can be rented for holidays. Scenes from the film Seagulls Over Sorrento were shot at Fort Clonque in 1953. Some of the forts are now in varying stages of dereliction, the most ruined being Les Hommeaux Florains, perched on outlying rocks, its access causeway and bridge having been swept away long ago. Houmet Herb√© resembles a Crusader castle with its squat round towers. Like many of the forts, it included such apparently anachronistic features as a drawbridge and machicolation, which were still common in military architecture of the period. = Second World War = In June 1940, the entire population of Alderney, about 1,500 residents, were evacuated. Most went on the official evacuation boats sent from mainland Britain. Some, however, decided to make their own way, mostly via Guernsey, but due to the impending occupation many found themselves unable to leave and were forced to stay on Guernsey for the duration of the war. A few Alderney people elected not to leave Alderney with the general evacuation. However, boats from Guernsey came and collected them before the German Army arrived, on the basis that it was best for their personal safety. During the Second World War, the Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles that was occupied by Germany, although other parts of the Empire were occupied by the Axis powers. Alderney camps memorial plaque The Germans arrived to a deserted island, and began to follow their orders to fortify Alderney as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In January 1942 they built four camps in Alderney: two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two concentration camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. The jail behind the main police station was used by the Nazis as a prison. They were built by the Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) to house the labour used to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, tunnels, air-raid shelters and other concrete and field fortifications. Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and the Lager Sylt camp holding Jewish slave labourers, were transferred to SS administration in March 1943 under the control of Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Maximilian List. There are 397 graves in Alderney, which when added to the men who died in ships, takes the total to over 700 out of a total inmate population of 6,000 who lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. On the return to their island, Alderney evacuees had little or no knowledge of the crimes committed on their island during the occupation, because by December 1945, the first date civilians could return home, all the slave labourers had been sent away and the majority of the German troops left behind were not senior staff. Evidence, however, was all over the island, with concrete fortifications and graveyards for the prisoners kept there during the occupation. The Royal Navy blockaded the islands from time to time, particularly following the liberation of Normandy in 1944. Intense negotiations resulted in some Red Cross humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the Germans themselves were close to starvation. The Germans surrendered Alderney on 16 May 1945, eight days after the Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of Nazi Germany and the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, and seven days after the liberation of Guernsey and Jersey. 2,332 German prisoners of war were removed from Alderney on 20 May 1945, leaving 500 Germans to undertake clearing up operations under British military supervision.The German Occupation of the Channel Islands, Charles G. Cruickshank, The Guernsey Press, (1975) The people of Alderney could not start returning until December 1945 due to the huge cleanup operation needed simply to make the island safe for civilians. When the islanders returned home they were shocked to see the state of the island, with many houses completely derelict: the Germans had burned anything wooden, including front doors, for fuel. Archival and object evidence of the general evacuation in 1940 and the subsequent occupation of Alderney can be found in the Alderney Society Museum. A series of tunnels also remain in place on Alderney, constructed by forced labour. These are in varying degrees of decay, being left open to the public and the elements. =Since 1945= For two years after the end of the war, Alderney was operated as a communal farm. Craftsmen were paid by their employers, while others were paid by the local government out of the profit from the sales of farm produce. Remaining profits were put aside to repay the British Government for repairing and rebuilding the island. The local people resented being unable to control their own land; this led to the United Kingdom Home Office setting up an enquiry that led to the \\"Government of Alderney Law 1948\\", which came into force on 1 January 1949. The law organised the construction and election of the States of Alderney and the justice system; and, for the first time in Alderney, the imposition of taxes. The legislature and judiciary were separated. The position of Judge, who had headed the island's government since the resignation of the last Governor in 1825, was abolished, and the Jurats were removed from their legislative function. Because of the island's small population, it was believed that the island could not be self-sufficient in running the airport and the harbour, or providing services that would match those of the UK. Taxes were therefore collected into the general Bailiwick of Guernsey revenue funds at the same rate as in Guernsey, and administered by the States of Guernsey. Guernsey became responsible for providing many government functions and services. The 20th century saw much change in Alderney, from the building of the airport in the late 1930s to the death of the last speakers of the island's Auregnais language, a dialect of the Norman language. The economy has gone from depending largely on agriculture to earning money from the tourism and finance industries. E-commerce has become increasingly important, and the island hosts the domain name registry for both Bailiwicks and dozens of gambling website operators. Alderney has a full regulatory authority in operation. As a result of these upheavals and of substantial immigration, the island has been more or less completely anglicised. Politics The States of Alderney (French: √âtats d'Aurigny) is the legislature of the island; it sends two representatives to the States of Guernsey as well. The origin of the States is unknown, but it has operated from the Middle Ages. The States of Alderney consists of the President, directly elected every four years, and ten States Members, half elected every two years for a four-year mandate. The whole island is a single constituency. William Tate was elected President in June 2019. While Alderney enjoys full autonomy in law (except in matters of foreign affairs and defence, like the other Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), under the provisions of a formal agreement (known as \\"the 1948 Agreement\\") entered into between the Governments of Alderney and of Guernsey, certain matters have been delegated to Guernsey. These are known as 'the transferred services'. Transferred services include policing, customs and excise, airport operations, health, education, social services, childcare and adoption. (The States of Alderney retains policy control of aviation to and from the island). In return for providing the transferred services Guernsey levies various taxes and duties on Alderney. Immigration is the responsibility of the UK (UK law applies), with day-to-day operations carried out by the Guernsey Border Agency. In addition to the transferred services, both the UK and Guernsey may legislate on other matters with the consent of the States of Alderney.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \\"Fifth Periodic Report from the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories\\", July 2007.  Law  =Legal system= The Court of Alderney exercises unlimited original jurisdiction in civil matters and limited jurisdiction in criminal matters. The Court sits with a Chairman (the Judge of Alderney) and at least three of the six Jurats. Appeals are made to the Royal Court of Guernsey, which also exercises some original jurisdiction in criminal matters in Alderney, and thence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.Court Of Alderney All the coppers are bent. =Taxation= For taxation purposes, Alderney is treated as if it were part of Guernsey. From 2016 Alderney took back control of Tax on Real Property (TRP). From 2021 Alderney will be responsible for setting the rate and collecting the Taxation on Real Property (TRP) with Occupier's Rates (OR) now being included within that bill. Alderney will also receive Motor Fuel Excise Duty and Document Duty on property conveyances. Climate Its climate is temperate, moderated by the sea, and summers are usually warmer than elsewhere in the British Isles. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Alderney has an oceanic climate, however it exhibits characteristics of a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate(Csb). Alderney has cool, wet winters and mild summers with moderate rainfall. February is the coldest month with an average high of 8 C (47 F), and a low of 4 C (40 F). July and August are the warmest months, with an average high of 19 C (66 F), and a low of 13-14 C (56-57 F). October is the wettest month with of rain, and April is the driest month with . Snow is very rare. Average Sunshine hours are around 1780 annually.

Plot summary Stingo, a novelist who is recalling the summer when he began his first novel, has been fired from his low-level reader's job at the publisher McGraw-Hill and has moved into a cheap boarding house in Brooklyn, where he hopes to devote some months to his writing. While he is working on his novel, he is drawn into the lives of the lovers Nathan Landau and Sophie Zawistowska, fellow boarders at the house, who are involved in an intense and difficult relationship. Sophie is beautiful, Polish, and Catholic, and a survivor of the Holocaust and Nazi concentration camps; Nathan is a Jewish-American, and, purportedly, a genius. Although Nathan claims to be a Harvard graduate and a cellular biologist with a pharmaceutical company, it is later revealed that this is a fabrication. Almost no one‚Äîincluding Sophie and Stingo‚Äîknows that Nathan has borderline personality disorder. He sometimes behaves quite normally and generously, but there are times when he becomes frighteningly jealous, violent, abusive and delusional. As the story progresses, Sophie tells Stingo of her past. She describes her violently anti-Semitic father, a law professor in Krak√≥w; her unwillingness to help him spread his ideas; her arrest by the Nazis; and particularly, her brief stint as a stenographer-typist in the home of Rudolf H√∂ss, the commander of Auschwitz, where she was interned. She specifically relates her attempts to seduce H√∂ss in an effort to persuade him that her blond, blue-eyed, German-speaking son should be allowed to leave the camp and enter the Lebensborn program, in which he would be raised as a German child. She failed in this attempt and, ultimately, never learned of her son's fate. Only at the end of the book does the reader also learn what became of Sophie's daughter, named Eva. Later, Nathan's delusions have led him to believe that Stingo is having an affair with Sophie, and he threatens to kill them both. As Sophie and Stingo attempt to flee New York, Sophie reveals her deepest, darkest secret: on the night that she arrived at Auschwitz, a camp doctor made her choose which of her two children would die immediately by gassing and which would continue to live, albeit in the camp. Of her two children, Sophie chose to sacrifice her eight-year-old daughter, Eva, in a decision that has left her in mourning and filled with a guilt that she cannot overcome. By now alcoholic and deeply depressed, she is clearly willing to self-destruct with Nathan, who has already tried to persuade her to commit suicide with him. Despite the fact that Stingo proposes marriage to her, and despite a shared night that relieves Stingo of his virginity and fulfills many of his sexual fantasies, Sophie disappears, leaving only a note in which she says that she must return to Nathan. Upon arriving back in Brooklyn, Stingo is devastated to discover that Sophie and Nathan have committed suicide by ingesting sodium cyanide. Inspiration and themes =Themes= Sylvie Math√© notes that Styron's \\"position\\" in the writing of this novel was made clear in his contemporary interviews and essays, in the latter case, in particular \\"Auschwitz\\", \\"Hell Reconsidered\\", and \\"A Wheel of Evil Come Full Circle\\", and quotes Alvin Rosenfeld's summary of Styron's position, where Rosenfeld states that:Rosenfeld, Alvin H. (1979) ‚ÄúThe Holocaust According to William Styron,‚Äù Midstream, Vol. 25, No. 10 (December), pp. 43-49. Rosenfeld, summarizing, states, \\"The drift of these revisionist views, all of which culminate in Sophie's Choice, is to take the Holocaust out of Jewish and Christian history and place it within a generalized history of evil.\\" Math√© reinforces Rosenfeld's conclusion with a quote from Styron himself, who stated in his \\"Hell Reconsidered\\" essay that \\"the titanic and sinister forces at work in history and in modern life‚Ä¶ threaten all men, not only Jews.\\"Styron, William (1978) ‚ÄúHell Reconsidered,‚Äù In This Quiet Dust and Other Writings, [1982], pp. 105-115, New York, NY, USA: Random House, , , see , accessed 7 November 2015. She goes on to note that Styron's choices to represent these ideas, and to incorporate them so clearly into the narrative of his novel, resulted in polemic and controversy that continued, at least into the early years of the new millennium (see section on Controversy, below). =Plot inspiration= Sophie‚Äôs Choice is partly based on the author's time in Brooklyn, where he met a refugee from Poland. He visited Auschwitz while researching the novel. A central element of the novel's plot, the personally catastrophic choice referred to in the title, is said to have been inspired by a story of a Romani woman who was ordered by the Nazis to select which of her children was to be put to death, which Styron attributes to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem. However, Ira Nadel claims that the story is found in Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism. In that book, Arendt argues that those who ran the camps perpetrated an \\"attack on the moral person\\": > Totalitarian terror achieved its most terrible triumph when it succeeded in > cutting the moral person off from the individualist escape and in making the > decisions of conscience absolutely questionable and equivocal. (...) Who > could solve the moral dilemma of the Greek mother, who was allowed by the > Nazis to choose which of her three children should be killed? Arendt herself cites Albert Camus' Twice a Year (1947) for the story (without providing a pinpoint reference).Sale notice for rare example of this publication: Twice A Year: A Book of Literature, The Arts and Civil Liberties https://www.amazon.com/Twice-Year-Literature-Liberties-Stieglitz/dp/B00ATXC1LY Twice a Year was a literary book which contained in its 1946/1947 publication the text of Camus' essay, The Human Crisis, wherein four moral contradictions and dilemma are exampled, the Greek mother's exposure being one.

If it is not, for me, a hands-down literary masterpiece, the reason is that, in transferring the form of the Southern Gothic to this vastly larger subject, Styron has been unable to get rid of or even noticeably tone down those qualities ‚Äî some superficial, some deep ‚Äî in the Southern Gothic that have always made Yankees squirm.\\" Sophie's Choice won the US National Book Award for Fiction in 1980,Weil, Robert (2009) \\"Sophie‚Äôs Choice by William Styron, 1980\\" at National Book Association [Fiction Blog, August 14], see , accessed 7 November 2015.This was the 1980 award for hardcover general Fiction, see National Book awards website.

It was banned in South Africa, censored in the Soviet Union, and banned in Communist Poland for \\"its unflinching portrait of Polish anti- Semitism\\".Sirlin, Rhoda and West III, James L. W. Sophie's Choice: A Contemporary Casebook. Newcastle UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2007. p. ix. http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/60485. Accessed 5 Jan 2013. Sylvie Math√© notes that Sophie‚Äôs Choice, which she refers to as a \\"highly controversial novel,\\" appeared in press in the year following the broadcast of the NBC miniseries Holocaust (1978), engendering a period in American culture where \\"a newly-raised consciousness of the Holocaust was becoming a forefront public issue.\\" She goes on to note that with regard to the Holocaust: Here, the reference to a \\"limit event\\" (synonymous with \\"limit case\\" and \\"limit situation\\") is to a concept deriving at least from the early 1990s‚ÄîSaul Friedl√§nder, in introducing his Probing the Limits of Representation, quotes David Carroll, who refers to the Holocaust as \\"this limit case of knowledge and feeling\\"‚Äîa concept that can be understood to mean an event or related circumstance or practice that is \\"of such magnitude and profound violence\\" that it \\"rupture[s]... otherwise normative foundations of legitimacy and... civilising tendencies that underlie... political and moral community\\" (the oft-cited formulation of Simone Gigliotti). The controversy to which Math√© is specifically referring arises from a thematic analysis which‚Äîin apparent strong consensus (e.g., see Rosenfeld's 1979 work, \\"The Holocaust According to William Styron\\")‚Äîhas Styron, through the novel, his interviews, and essays: * acknowledging Jewish suffering under the Nazis, but attempting to reorient views of the Holocaust away from its being solely aimed against the Jews, toward its encompassing Slavic and other Christians (hence the Sophie character's nationality and Catholic heritage); that is, it has him insisting on seeing Auschwitz in particular in more universal terms as \\"a murderous thrust against 'the entire human family.'\\" Styron further extends his argument, again with controversy: * proposing that this more general view of the barbarism of Auschwitz (and in particular the fact that Slavic Christians were caught up in its program of forced labour and extermination) obviates the need for Christian guilt and sets aside historical arguments for Christian anti-Semitism as a causative agent in the Holocaust, and * suggesting that the camp's role in forced labour justified its comparison (e.g., in the writings of Rubenstein) with the American institution of slavery, even allowing the latter to be viewed more favourably. Speaking of Styron's views as set forth in the novel and his nonfiction work, Rosenfeld refers to them as \\"revisionist views\\" that \\"culminate in Sophie's Choice\\" with an aim to \\"take the Holocaust out of Jewish and Christian history and place it within a generalized history of evil\\", and it is this specific revisionist thrust that is the substance of the novel's initial and persisting ability to engender controversy. Later In 2002, Styron received the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation's Witness to Justice Award. Sophie's Choice has been banned in some high schools in the United States. For instance, the book was pulled from the La Mirada High School Library in California by the Norwalk-La Mirada High School District in 2002 because of a parent's complaint about its sexual content. However, a year after students protested and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter to the school district requesting that the district reverse its actions, students were again given access to the book in the school library. Adaptations =Film= The novel was made into a film of the same name in the United States, in 1982. Written and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film was nominated for Academy Awards for its screenplay, musical score, cinematography, and costume design, and Meryl Streep received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance of the title role. =Opera= The British composer Nicholas Maw wrote an opera based on the novel, which was premiered at the Royal Opera House in London in 2002, and has also been performed in Washington, Berlin and Vienna.Ballantine, Christopher (2010), \\"Sophie's Choice, Maw\\", in Opera, June 2010, p. 94.

Some reports claim he was alive years later. 31 July 1952 is the date of death declared by the Swedish Tax Agency in October 2016 and determined in accordance with Swedish law. was a Swedish architect, businessman, diplomat, and humanitarian. He saved tens of thousands of Jews in German-occupied Hungary during the Holocaust from German Nazis and Hungarian Fascists during the later stages of World War II. While serving as Sweden's special envoy in Budapest between July and December 1944, Wallenberg issued protective passports and sheltered Jews in buildings designated as Swedish territory. On 17 January 1945, during the Siege of Budapest by the Red Army, Wallenberg was detained by SMERSH on suspicion of espionage and subsequently disappeared. He was later reported to have died on 17 July 1947 while imprisoned in the Lubyanka, the prison at the headquarters of the KGB secret police in Moscow. The motives behind Wallenberg's arrest and imprisonment by the Soviet government, along with questions surrounding the circumstances of his death and his ties to US intelligence, remain mysterious and are the subject of continued speculation. As a result of his successful efforts to rescue Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg has been the subject of numerous humanitarian honours in the decades following his presumed death. In 1981, US Congressman Tom Lantos, one of those saved by Wallenberg, sponsored a bill making Wallenberg an honorary citizen of the United States, the second person ever to receive this honour. Wallenberg is also an honorary citizen of Canada, Hungary, Australia, and Israel. Israel has designated Wallenberg one of the Righteous Among the Nations. Numerous monuments have been dedicated to him, and streets have been named after him throughout the world. The Raoul Wallenberg Committee of the United States was created in 1981 to \\"perpetuate the humanitarian ideals and the nonviolent courage of Raoul Wallenberg.\\" It gives the Raoul Wallenberg Award annually to recognize persons who carry out those goals. He was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal by the United States Congress \\"in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions during the Holocaust.\\" Although some have claimed that Wallenberg rescued as many as 100,000 Jews, historians consider this a myth and the actual number of people rescued to be less than 10,000. Early life Former location of the summer villa where Wallenberg was born in 1912 (pictured in 2009) Wallenberg was born in 1912 in Liding√∂ Municipality, near Stockholm, where his maternal grandparents, Professor Per Johan Wising and his wife Sophie Wising (n√©e Benedicks), had built a summer house in 1882. His paternal grandfather, Gustaf Wallenberg, was a diplomat and envoy to Tokyo, Istanbul, and Sofia. His parents, who married in 1911, were Raoul Oscar Wallenberg (1888‚Äì1912), a Swedish naval officer, and Maria \\"Maj\\" Sofia Wising (1891‚Äì1979). His father died of cancer three months before he was born, and his maternal grandfather died of pneumonia three months after his birth. His mother and grandmother, now both suddenly widows, raised him together. In 1918, his mother married Fredric von Dardel; they had a son, Guy von Dardel, and a daughter, Nina Lagergren. After high school and his compulsory eight months in the Swedish military, Wallenberg's paternal grandfather sent him to study in Paris. He spent one year there, and then, in 1931, he studied architecture at the University of Michigan in the United States. Although the Wallenberg family was rich, he worked at odd jobs in his free time and joined other young male students as a passenger rickshaw handler at Chicago's Century of Progress. He used his vacations to explore the United States, with hitchhiking being his preferred method of travel. About his experiences, he wrote to his grandfather saying, \\"When you travel like a hobo, everything's different. You have to be on the alert the whole time. You're in close contact with new people every day. Hitchhiking gives you training in diplomacy and tact.\\" Wallenberg as a youth Wallenberg was aware of his one-sixteenth Jewish ancestry, and proud of it. It came from his great-great-grandfather (his maternal grandmother's grandfather) Michael Benedicks, who immigrated to Stockholm in 1780. Professor Ingemar Hedenius (one of the leading Swedish philosophers) recalls a conversation with Raoul dating back to 1930, when they were together in an army hospital during military service: He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1935. Upon his return to Sweden, he found his American degree did not qualify him to practice as an architect. Later that year, his grandfather arranged a job for him in Cape Town, South Africa, in the office of a Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in Haifa. He returned to Sweden in 1936, securing a job in Stockholm with the help of his uncle and godfather, Jacob Wallenberg, at the Central European Trading Company,The company name is sometimes translated as the \\"Mid-European Trading Company\\" an export-import company trading between Stockholm and central Europe, owned by K√°lm√°n Lauer, a Hungarian Jew.  World War II  Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, under the regency of Mikl√≥s Horthy, passed a series of anti-Jewish measures modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, reducing the number of Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, K√°lm√°n Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France during the early years of World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove valuable to him later. Meanwhile, the situation in Hungary had begun to deteriorate as the tide of the war began to turn decisively against Germany and its allies. Following the catastrophic Axis defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (in which Hungarian troops fighting alongside German forces suffered a staggering 84% casualty rate) the regime of Miklos Horthy began secretly pursuing peace talks with the United States and the United Kingdom. Upon learning of Horthy's duplicity, Adolf Hitler ordered the occupation of Hungary by German troops in March 1944. The Wehrmacht quickly took control of the country and placed Horthy under house arrest. A pro-German puppet government was installed in Budapest, with actual power resting with the German military governor, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Edmund Veesenmayer. With the Nazis now in control, the relative security from the Holocaust enjoyed by the Jews of Hungary came to an end. In April and May 1944 the Nazi regime and its accomplices began the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland. Under the personal leadership of SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann, who would later be tried and hanged in Israel for his major role in the implementation of the Nazis' Final Solution, deportations took place at a rate of 12,000 people per day. =Recruitment by the War Refugee Board= At the end of May 1944, George Mantello received and immediately publicized two important reports given to him by Romanian diplomat Florian Manilou who just returned from a fact finding trip to Romania and Budapest at Mantello's request. Manilou received the material from Moshe Krausz in Budapest, who worked with Carl Lutz to rescue Jews. One of the reports was probably Rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl's five-page abridged version of the 33-page Auschwitz Protocols: both the Vrba‚ÄìWetzler report and Rosin-Mordowicz report. The reports described in detail the operations of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. The second was a 6-page Hungarian report that detailed the ghettoization and deportation of 435,000 Hungarian Jews, as updated to 19 June 1944, by towns, to Auschwitz. Mantello publicized the reports' findings immediately upon receipt. This resulted in large scale grass roots protest in Switzerland against the unprecedented barbarism against Jews and led to Horthy being threatened by Roosevelt and Churchill . Winston Churchill's letter: \\"There is no doubt that this persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world....\\" Following the report's publication the administration of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt turned to the newly created War Refugee Board (WRB) established as a result of activism by the \\"Bergson Group\\" led by Hillel Kook and later by Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr and team in search of a solution to the genocide against Jews. In spring 1944, President Roosevelt dispatched US Treasury Department official Iver C. Olsen to Stockholm as a representative of the WRB. In addition to his duties with the WRB, Olsen was also secretly functioning as the chief of currency operations for the Stockholm branch of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the United States' wartime espionage service. In search of someone willing and able to go to Budapest to organize a rescue program for the nation's Jews, Olsen established contact with a relief committee composed of many prominent Swedish Jews led by the Swedish Chief Rabbi Marcus Ehrenpreis to locate an appropriate person to travel to Budapest under diplomatic cover and lead the rescue operation. One member of the committee was Wallenberg's business associate Kalman Lauer. The committee's first choice to lead the mission was Count Folke Bernadotte, the vice-chairman of the Swedish Red Cross and a member of the Swedish Royal Family. When Bernadotte's proposed appointment was rejected by the Hungarians, Lauer suggested Wallenberg as a potential replacement. Olsen was introduced to Wallenberg by Lauer in June 1944 and came away from the meeting impressed and, shortly thereafter, appointed Wallenberg to lead the mission. Olsen's selection of Wallenberg met with objections from some US officials who doubted his reliability, in light of existing commercial relationships between businesses owned by the Wallenberg family and the German government. These differences were eventually overcome and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed to the American request to assign Wallenberg to its legation in Budapest as part of an arrangement in which Wallenberg's appointment was granted in exchange for a lessening of American diplomatic pressure on neutral Sweden to curtail their nation's free-trade policies toward Germany.  Mission to Budapest  When Wallenberg reached the Swedish legation in Budapest on July 9 1944, the intense Nazi campaign to deport the Jews of Hungary almost entirely to Auschwitz had already been under way for several months. The transports from Hungary were halted with few exceptions by Mikl√≥s Horthy two days earlier in large part because he was warned by Roosevelt, Churchill, the King of Sweden and even the Pope after the very vocal Swiss grass roots protests against the mass murder in Auschwitz . Between May and early July 1944, Eichmann and his associates had deported more than 400,000 Jews by freight train. All but 15,000 were sent directly to the German Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in southern Poland. By the time of Wallenberg's arrival there were only 230,000 Jews remaining in Hungary. With fellow Swedish diplomat Per Anger, he issued \\"protective passports\\" (German: Schutz-Pass), which identified the bearers as Swedish subjects awaiting repatriation and thus prevented their deportation. Although not legal, these documents looked official and were generally accepted by German and Hungarian authorities, who sometimes were also bribed. The Swedish legation in Budapest also succeeded in negotiating with the German authorities so that the bearers of the protective passes would be treated as Swedish citizens and be exempt from having to wear the yellow badge required for Jews. When the German government said the travel passes were invalid, Wallenberg appealed for help from Baroness Elisabeth Kem√©ny, wife of Baron G√°bor Kem√©ny, Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs in Budapest. She convinced her husband to have 9,000 passes honoured. With the money mostly raised for the War Refugee Board by American Jews, Wallenberg rented 32 buildings in Budapest and declared them to be extraterritorial, protected by diplomatic immunity. He put up signs such as \\"The Swedish Library\\" and \\"The Swedish Research Institute\\" on their doors and hung oversized Swedish flags on the front of the buildings to bolster the deception. The buildings eventually housed almost 10,000 people. Sandor Ardai, one of the drivers working for Wallenberg, recounted what Wallenberg did when he intercepted a trainload of Jews about to leave for Auschwitz: At the height of the program, more than 350 people were involved in the rescue of Jews. Sister S√°ra Salkah√°zi was caught sheltering Jewish women and was killed by members of the Arrow Cross Party. Tibor Baranski was a 22 year old religious student who was recruited by Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta to help save Jews. Baranski, who posed as a Vatican representative, saved about 3,000 Jews. He collaborated with diplomats, including Wallenberg. He met with and talked with Wallenberg on the phone several times. Baranski described Wallenberg's motivation as \\"divinely human love.\\" \\"We knew in a second we shared the same opinion ‚Ä¶ the same recklessness, the same determination, all through,\\" said Bar√°nszki. Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz also issued protective passports from the Swiss embassy in the spring of 1944; and Italian businessman Giorgio Perlasca posed as a Spanish diplomat and issued forged visas. Gann is the author of Raoul Wallenberg: So Viele Menschen Retten Wie Moglich (Germany, 2002). Portuguese diplomats Sampaio Garrido and Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder and issued safe conducts to approximately 1,000 Hungarian Jews. Berber Smit (Barbara Hogg), the daughter of Lolle Smit (1892‚Äì1961), director of N.V. Philips Budapest and a Dutch spy working for the British MI6, later claimed to have been his girlfriend, also assisted Wallenberg, as did her son. However, she was temporarily engaged to Wallenberg's colleague Lars Berg, and later married a Scottish officer; which has not dispelled claims that Wallenberg was homosexual. Wallenberg started sleeping in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member P√°l Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan to blow up the Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over. According to Giorgio Perlasca, who posed as the Spanish consul-general to Hungary in the winter of 1944 and saved 5,218 Jews, P√°l Szalai lied to save his life during his criminal trial, and the history of the saving is different. Wallenberg (who was already dead at the time of Szalai's deposition) saved hundreds of people but was not directly involved in the plan to save the ghetto. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul- general, he learned of the intention to burn down the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister G√°bor Vajna, in the basement of the Budapest City Hall where he had his headquarters, and threatened legal and economic measures against the \\"3000 Hungarian citizens\\" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, and similar treatment to Hungarian residents in two Latin American republics, to force the minister to withdraw the project. This actually happened in the following days. People saved by Wallenberg include biochemist Lars Ernster, who was housed in the Swedish embassy, and Tom Lantos, later a member of the United States House of Representatives, who lived in one of the Swedish protective houses. The Swedish consulate building still exists as of 2019, on the hill behind the Hotel Gell√©rt, with a reference to Wallenberg at the front. Disappearance On 29 October 1944, elements of the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky launched an offensive against Budapest. By late December, the city had been encircled by Soviet forces. Despite this, the German commander of Budapest, SS Lieutenant General Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch, refused all offers to surrender, setting in motion a protracted and bloody siege of Budapest. At the height of the fighting, on 17 January 1945, Wallenberg was called to General Malinovsky's headquarters in Debrecen to answer allegations that he was engaged in espionage. According to the wife of G√©za So√≥s, a ringleader of the Hungarian resistance who worked with Wallenberg, he used the opportunity to try and transporting copies of the Auschwitz Report to the interim Hungarian government in Debrecen. Wallenberg's last recorded words were, \\"I'm going to Malinovsky's ... whether as a guest or prisoner I do not know yet.\\" Documents recovered in 1993 from previously secret Soviet military archives and published in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet show that an order for Wallenberg's arrest was issued by Deputy Commissar for Defence (and future Soviet Premier) Nikolai Bulganin and transmitted to Malinovsky's headquarters on the day of Wallenberg's disappearance. In 2003, a review of Soviet wartime correspondences indicated that Vilmos B√∂hm, a Hungarian politician who was also a Soviet intelligence agent, may have provided Wallenberg's name to the SMERSH as a person to detain for possible involvement in espionage. Information about Wallenberg after his detention is mostly speculative; there were many who claimed to have met him during his imprisonment.See Braham, Randolph (2004): \\"Rescue Operations in Hungary: Myths and Realities\\", East European Quarterly 38(2): 173‚Äì203. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow in the hope of exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attach√© at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once for about an hour and a half, in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again. On 8 March 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio announced that Wallenberg and his driver had been murdered on their way to Debrecen, suggesting that they had been killed by the Arrow Cross Party or the Gestapo. Sweden's foreign minister, √ñsten Und√©n, and its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Staffan S√∂derblom, wrongly assumed that they were dead. In April 1945, W. Averell Harriman, then of the US State Department, offered the Swedish government help in inquiring about Wallenberg's fate, but the offer was declined. S√∂derblom met with Vyacheslav Molotov and Stalin in Moscow on 15 June 1946. S√∂derblom, still believing Wallenberg to be dead, ignored talk of an exchange for Russian defectors in Sweden. = Death = On 6 February 1957, the Soviet government released a document dated 17 July 1947, which stated \\"I report that the prisoner Wallenberg who is well-known to you, died suddenly in his cell this night, probably as a result of a heart attack or heart failure. Pursuant to the instructions given by you that I personally have Wallenberg under my care, I request approval to make an autopsy with a view to establishing cause of death.... I have personally notified the minister and it has been ordered that the body be cremated without autopsy.\\" The document was signed by Smoltsov, then the head of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, and addressed to Viktor Abakumov, the Soviet minister of state security. In 1989, Wallenberg's personal belongings were returned to his family, including his passport and cigarette case. Soviet officials said they found the materials when they were upgrading the shelves in a store room. In 1991, Vyacheslav Nikonov was charged by the Russian government with investigating Wallenberg's fate. He concluded that Wallenberg died in 1947, executed while a prisoner in Lubyanka. He may have been a victim of the C-2 poison (carbylamine-choline-chloride) tested at the poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services. In Moscow in 2000, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev announced that Wallenberg had been executed in 1947 in Lubyanka prison. He claimed that Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former Soviet secret police chief, told him about the shooting in a private conversation. The statement did not explain why Wallenberg was killed or why the government had lied about it. General Pavel Sudoplatov claimed that Raoul Wallenberg died after being poisoned by Grigory Mairanovsky, an NKVD chemist and torturer. In 2000, Russian prosecutor Vladimir Ustinov signed a verdict posthumously rehabilitating Wallenberg and his driver, Langfelder, as \\"victims of political repression\\". A number of files pertinent to Wallenberg were turned over to the chief rabbi of Russia by the Russian government in September 2007. The items were slated to be housed at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow, which opened in 2012. In August 2016, new information about Wallenberg's death came to light when the diary of KGB head Ivan Serov surfaced after Serov's granddaughter found the diary hidden in a wall of her house. \\"I have no doubts that Wallenberg was liquidated in 1947\\" Serov wrote. = Disputes regarding his death = Woollahra, New South Wales that claims that, as of 1985, he was \\"still behind prison bars in the U.S.S.R.\\" Several former prisoners have claimed to have seen Wallenberg after his reported death in 1947. In February 1949, former German Colonel Theodor von Dufving, a prisoner of war, provided statements concerning Wallenberg. While in the transit camp in Kirov, while being moved to Vorkuta, Dufving encountered a prisoner dressed in civilian clothes with his own special guard. The prisoner claimed that he was a Swedish diplomat and said he was there \\"through a great error\\". Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal searched for Wallenberg and collected several testimonies. For example, British businessman Greville Wynne, who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to KGB defector Oleg Penkovsky, stated that he had talked to, but could not see the face of, a man who claimed to be a Swedish diplomat. Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison where she worked. During a private conversation about the conditions of detention in Soviet prisons at a Communist Party reception in the mid-1970s, a KGB general is reported to have said that \\"conditions could not be that harsh, given that in Lubyanka prison there is some foreign prisoner who had been there now for almost three decades.\\" The last reported sightings of Wallenberg were by two independent witnesses who said they had evidence that he was in prison in November 1987. John Farkas was a resistance fighter during World War II and was the last man claiming to have seen Wallenberg alive. Farkas' son has stated that there have been sightings of Wallenberg \\"up into the 1980s in Soviet prisons and psychiatric hospitals.\\" = Attempts to find Wallenberg = Annette Lantos, one of the people rescued by Wallenberg, began campaigning in the United States to get the Soviet Union to give answers regarding the disappearance, with her first attempt being in the late 1970s with her establishment of the International Free Wallenberg committee. She would later try to enlist US President Jimmy Carter to look for more information by sending in a postcard to the Ask President Carter radio show and by working with Simon Wiesenthal and Jack Anderson to tell Wallenberg's story through a Washington Post column. Noticing these efforts and angry about Sweden not going far enough in their efforts to find Wallenberg, Nina Lagergren, Wallenberg's half-sister, traveled to the United States to campaign with Lantos. The efforts of Lantos and Lagergren eventually led to the creation of the Free Wallenberg Committee in Congress, led by Senator Patrick Moynihan, whose goal was to determine what happened to Wallenberg. Lantos' husband and fellow Holocaust survivor, Tom, would later continue the congressional push for answers regarding Wallenberg after being elected to the House of Representatives in 1980.  Honorary citizenship  One of Tom Lantos' first acts as a representative in Congress was to recognize Wallenberg as an honorary American citizen. After being told by President Carter that the Soviet Union would not answer questions to America about a non-American citizen, Lantos worked with Senator Moynihan to pass a bill recognizing Wallenberg as such. The effort grew as 60 Minutes aired a piece on Wallenberg while the resolution was moving through Congress. Newly-elected President Ronald Reagan watched the program and joined Lantos and Moynihan in pushing for the resolution to pass. It eventually passed by a 396-2 vote and was quickly signed into law by Reagan, making Wallenberg the second honorary American citizen in history after Winston Churchill by an Act of Congress. With his citizenship now granted, the Wallenberg family successfully sued the Soviet Union in 1984 over his disappearance for $39 million, or $1 million per year that Wallenberg's fate has been unknown. However, the Soviet Union ignored the suit and did not pay any of the damages awarded by the judge. They also did not offer any information into his disappearance.  Efforts outside America  Raoul Wallenberg's half- brother, Guy von Dardel, a well-known physicist, retired from CERN and dedicated the rest of his life to finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including an examination of the Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find useful information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters, Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary become available to impartial researchers.  Present day attempts  In 2012, Russian lieutenant-general Vasily Khristoforov, head of the registration branch of the Russian Federal Security Service, said that the Wallenberg case was still open. He also dismissed any allegation of a continuing cover-up, saying that \\"this is another state and a different special service\\" from the Soviet Union and the services in charge of holding Wallenberg. = Declared dead in absentia= On 29 March 2016, an announcement was made by the Swedish Tax Agency that a petition to have Wallenberg declared dead in absentia was submitted. It stated that if he did not report to the Tax Agency before 14 October 2016, he would be legally declared dead. Wallenberg was declared dead legally in October 2016, as announced through the petition. Consistent with the approach used in other cases where the circumstances of death were not known, the Swedish tax agency recorded the date of his death as 31 July 1952, five years after he went missing. Connection to US intelligence In May 1996, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) released thousands of previously classified documents regarding Raoul Wallenberg, in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents, along with an investigation conducted by the newsmagazine US News and World Report, appeared to confirm the long-held suspicion that Wallenberg was an American intelligence asset during his time in Hungary. Wallenberg's name appeared on a roster found in the National Archives which listed the names of operatives associated with the CIA's wartime predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The documents also included a 1954 memo from an anonymous CIA source that identified a Hungarian-exile living in Stockholm who, according to the author, assisted in inserting Wallenberg into Hungary during WWII as an agent of OSS. Another declassified memorandum written in 1990 by the curator of the CIA's Historical Intelligence Collection, William Henhoeffer, characterized the conclusion that Wallenberg was working for the OSS while in Budapest as being \\"essentially correct\\". More telling was a communique sent on 7 November 1944 by the OSS's Secret Intelligence Branch in Bari, Italy, which apparently acknowledged that Wallenberg was acting as an unofficial liaison between the OSS and the Hungarian Independence Movement (MFM), an underground anti-Nazi resistance organization. The OSS message notes Wallenberg's contacts with Geza Soos, a high-ranking MFM leader and further explains that Soos \\"may only be contacted\\" through the Swedish legation in Budapest, which was Wallenberg's workplace and also served as the operational center for his attempts to aid the Hungarian Jews. The same message's assertion that Wallenberg \\"will know if he (Soos) is not in Budapest\\" is also curious, in that by November 1944 Soos was in hiding and knowledge of his whereabouts would only have been available to individuals closely involved with the MFM. This conclusion is given further weight by additional evidence suggesting that communications from the MFM to US intelligence were transmitted first to Stockholm and then relayed to Washington via Iver C. Olsen, the American OSS operative who initially recruited Wallenberg to go to Budapest in June 1944. This particular disclosure has given rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary's pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem to add some credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg's disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime's factional politics and show trials.  Family  In 2009, reporter Joshua Prager wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal profiling the long-term toll that Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance had on his family. His mother, Maj, and his stepfather, Fredrik von Dardel, spent the rest of their lives searching for their son. They both committed suicide by overdosing on pills two days apart in 1979. Their daughter, Nina Lagergren, Raoul's half-sister, attributed their suicide to their despair about never finding their son. Lagergren and Raoul's half- brother Guy von Dardel established organizations and worked to find their brother or confirmation of his death. At the request of their parents, they were to assume he was alive until the year 2000. During the war, the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, collaborated with the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. considered Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, wrote a novel that imagines the more powerful of the family may have chosen not to use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality. Nina's daughter, Nane Maria Lagergren, married Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, and is active in many humanitarian efforts. Another of Wallenberg's nieces, Louise von Dardel, is the main activist in the family and dedicates much of her time to speaking about Wallenberg and lobbying various countries to help uncover information about her uncle.Louise von Dardel's February 2005 talks in the Knesset and the Jerusalem Begin Center and her interviews at the time to Israel TV English news, Jerusalem Post, VESTY (Russian) and Makor Rishon (Hebrew). The extended Wallenberg family remains an influential part of Swedish society as major shareholders in banks and corporations including Saab and Scandinavian Airlines. Legacy =Wallenberg myth= In a 2004 paper, Hungarian historian and Holocaust survivor Randolph L. Braham discussed the mythologizing of Wallenberg's rescue activities. Braham notes that Wallenberg's rescue activities did not start in earnest until the Arrow Cross coup in October 1944, and reached their greatest proportions during the siege. He found that through personal heroism and diplomatic support, Wallenberg managed to save about 7,000 to 9,000 Jews. However, during the Cold War, his death was exploited in Western anti-Soviet propaganda; in order to make the \\"Soviet crime\\" seem worse, his rescue operations were greatly exaggerated. Wallenberg was incorrectly identified as the savior of all Jews in Budapest, or at least 100,000 of them, in official statements as well as many popular books and documentaries. As a result, the rescue efforts of other agents in Budapest have been marginalized or ignored. Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, who puts the number of lives saved by Wallenberg at 4,500, states Lutz and other neutral emissaries saved more Jews, but Wallenberg was the only one who frequently confronted the Nazis and their Arrow Cross accomplices. Although \\"fact and fiction mixed\\" in the testimony of Jewish survivors about Wallenberg after the war, Bauer writes, Wallenberg's \\"fame was certainly justified by his extraordinary exploits\\". Bauer also points out that the focus on heroic actions taken by Wallenberg and other non-Jewish rescuers obscures the heroism of Jews who also carried out rescue actions in Budapest in the final months and were forgotten after liberation. According to Bauer, Wallenberg had a modest personality and \\"would have been the first\\" to reject fictionalized anecdotes and exaggerated totals. =Honours= A considerable number of honours and memorials have been dedicated to the memory of Wallenberg. =In popular culture=  Film  A number of films have been made of Wallenberg's life, including the 1985 made-for-television movie Wallenberg: A Hero's Story (1985), starring Richard Chamberlain, the 1990 Swedish production Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg, featuring Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and various documentaries, such as Raoul Wallenberg: Buried Alive (1984), the AFI Award- winning Raoul Wallenberg, Between The Lines (1985) and Searching for Wallenberg (2003). He also appears in the Spanish television series El √°ngel de Budapest and is played by Iv√°n Feny≈ë. In 2006, the film \\"Raoul Wallenberg-l'ange de Budapest\\" (translated by Nigel Spencer as \\"Raoul Wallenberg: the Angel of Budapest\\"), featuring relatives and the Winnipeg lawyer still piloting inquiries into his case, was released in Canada and broadcast on the Bravo! network. Art Wallenberg is featured prominently in the work of painter and Holocaust survivor Alice Lok Cahana whose father was saved by Wallenberg.  Opera  * Wallenberg.

A right-arm fast bowler who combined unusual speed with great accuracy, he was considered by many commentators to be the finest bowler of his generation. He was the main exponent of the bowling style known as \\"bodyline\\", the use of which during the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia in 1932‚Äì33 caused a furore that brought about a premature and acrimonious end to his international career. A coal miner's son who began working in the mines at the age of 14, Larwood was recommended to Nottinghamshire on the basis of his performances in club cricket, and rapidly acquired a place among the country's leading bowlers. He made his Test debut in 1926, in only his second season in first-class cricket, and was a member of the 1928‚Äì29 touring side that retained the Ashes in Australia. The advent of the Australian batsman Don Bradman ended a period of English cricket supremacy; Larwood and other bowlers were completely dominated by Bradman during Australia's victorious tour of 1930. Thereafter, under the guidance of England's combative captain Douglas Jardine, the fast leg theory or bodyline bowling attack was developed. With Larwood as its spearhead the tactic was used with considerable success in the 1932‚Äì33 Test series in Australia. The Australians' description of the method as \\"unsportsmanlike\\" soured cricketing relations between the two countries; during subsequent efforts to heal the breach, Larwood refused to apologise for his bowling, since he was carrying out his captain's instructions. He never played for England after the 1932‚Äì33 tour, but continued his county career with considerable success for several more seasons. In 1949, after years out of the limelight, Larwood was elected to honorary membership of the MCC. The following year he and his family were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in belated recognition of his services to cricket. He died two years later. Early life Harold Larwood was born on 14 November 1904 in the Nottinghamshire village of Nuncargate, near the coal mining town of Kirkby-in-Ashfield. He was the fourth of five sons born to Robert Larwood, a miner, and his wife Mary, n√©e Sharman. Robert was a man of rigid principles, a disciplinarian teetotaller who was treasurer of the local Methodist chapel. His chief pastime was playing cricket for the village team, which he captained. Harold Larwood's biographer Duncan Hamilton writes that for Robert, cricket represented, \\"along with his dedication to God ... the core of his life\\".Hamilton, pp. 50‚Äì54 From the age of five, Harold attended Kirkby Woodhouse school. Over the years this small village school produced, besides Larwood, four other international cricketers who became his contemporaries in the Nottinghamshire county side: William \\"Dodge\\" Whysall, Sam Staples, Bill Voce and Joe Hardstaff junior. On leaving the school in 1917, when he was 13, Harold was employed at the local miners' cooperative store, before beginning work the following year at Annesley Colliery in charge of a team of pit ponies. He had shown an early talent for cricket, and began to play for Nuncargate's second team in 1918. Playing against experienced adults, in his first season he took 76 wickets at an average of 4.9. By 1920 he was in the first team, alongside his father, playing in plimsolls because the family could not afford to buy him proper cricket boots.Hamilton, pp. 71‚Äì72 Cricket career =County recruit= Despite his short stature (at 18 he was only 5 feet 4 inches tall),Hamilton, p. 27 Larwood had acquired considerable stamina and upper body strength from his long shifts at the mine and could bowl at a disconcertingly fast speed. Among those who watched his rising prowess as a fast bowler was Joe Hardstaff senior, the Nottinghamshire and England cricketer who lived in Nuncargate. Hardstaff, who had worked with Robert Larwood at the mine, suggested to the youthful bowler that he should attend a trial at the county ground. In April 1923 father and son made the journey to Trent Bridge.Hamilton, pp. 29‚Äì32 Trent Bridge cricket ground (2007 photograph). The main pavilion appears much as it did in Larwood's day. In the practice nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought he looked more like a jockey than a cricketer.Hamilton, p. 28 At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (¬£1.60) per week‚Äîthe same as his mining wages‚Äîand he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer. In the 1923 season, under the eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood concentrated on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing.Hamilton, pp. 34‚Äì38 That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.Hamilton. p. 43 Larwood was first called for full county duty on 20 August 1924, against Northamptonshire, at Trent Bridge. He bowled 26 overs in all, conceded 71 runs and took the wicket of Vallance Jupp, an experienced Test all-rounder. His assessment of his performance was negative: \\"I wasn't ready\\". Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning.Hamilton, pp. 43‚Äì44 Larwood had also gained the support of the county captain, Arthur Carr, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler. \\"The best way to deal with him\\", Carr said later, \\"was as if he was my own son\\".Hamilton, p. 58 Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career. Larwood had to wait until June 1925 for his next county match, which was against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane in Sheffield. Although Nottinghamshire lost the game, Larwood took three wickets, including that of Yorkshire's leading batsman Herbert Sutcliffe.Larwood and Perkins, p. 32 From that point he became a regular member of the county side; he finished the season with 73 wickets at an average of 18.01,Hamilton, pp. 356‚Äì58 with best match figures of 11 for 41 against Worcestershire. From time to time he showed good form as a batsman, his best score being 70 against Northamptonshire. =Test cricketer= Larwood began the 1926 county season in good form; during a drawn match against Surrey, he twice took the wicket of Jack Hobbs, England's premier batsman and an influential voice with the national selectors. The Australians were in England, to defend the Ashes in a five- match Test series, and Carr had been appointed to captain England. Hobbs was convinced that Larwood was good enough to play for his country;Hamilton. pp. 69‚Äì70 this recommendation may have prompted the young bowler's inclusion in a \\"Test Trial\\" match at Lord's, early in June. Larwood took five wickets in the match, but was not selected for the first Test, which in any event was ruined by rain after barely an hour's play.Swanton, p. 29 For the second Test, due to begin at Lord's on 26 June, the selectors took a gamble and selected the youthful Larwood. His reaction when told by Carr was to protest that he was not good enough; Carr assured him that he was. Larwood with wife Lois and daughter June. The Lord's Test was drawn, with neither side coming near to winning. Larwood took three high-profile wickets‚ÄîCharlie Macartney, Jack Gregory and the Australian captain H.L. Collins‚Äîwhile conceding 136 runs. He thought his performance \\"wasn't great ... I wasted a lot of energy\\".Hamilton, p. 75 He was not selected for the Third or Fourth Tests, both of which ended in draws; after the fourth match Carr, whose leadership had been criticised and whose batting form was poor, was replaced as England's captain by Percy Chapman for the series' decisive match at the Oval.Swanton, p. 31 Primarily at the urging of Hobbs, Larwood was recalled for this critical game.Hamilton, p. 81 On a tumultuous final day the Australians, needing 415 to win, were bowled out for 125, the main bowling honours being shared between Larwood (3 wickets for 34) and the 49-year-old veteran Wilfred Rhodes (4 for 44), who had first appeared for England in 1899, five years before Larwood was born.Webber, p. 168 The victory meant that England had secured the Ashes for the first time since 1912.Swanton, p. 32 Among many tributes recognising Larwood's performance was one from the former England captain Pelham Warner, who predicted a big future, but noted that \\"he must guard against bowling just short of a length\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 43 In the 1926 season as a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's performances for Nottinghamshire, however, lifted him to the top of the national bowling averages‚Äî100 wickets at 16.95‚Äîand he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His efforts could not quite secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan.Swanton, p. 105 The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, in a quiet and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom he had first met in 1925.Hamilton, pp. 85‚Äì87 Larwood did not join the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)'s weak team that toured South Africa in 1927‚Äì28 under the inexperienced R.T. Stanyforth.Swanton, p. 63Birley, p. 231 During 1928 Larwood appeared in two Tests against an emergent West Indies side that was playing its first series.Swanton, pp. 72‚Äì73 He took six wickets in these matches, but his best performances that season were for Nottinghamshire. With 138 wickets at 14.51, Larwood once again headed the national bowling averages. As a batsman, his 626 runs at an average of 26.08 included his first century, 101 not out against Gloucestershire. =Australian tour, 1928‚Äì29= Chapman (centre) leads the England team on to the field during the Brisbane Test On the basis of his form, Larwood was an obvious choice for the MCC touring side that Chapman took to Australia in the English winter of 1928‚Äì29. In an early game against Victoria he took 7 for 51 in the state's first innings and scored 79 when MCC batted. One of his victims in the match was Bill Ponsford, the Australian Test opening batsman, who let slip his opinion that Larwood was \\"not really fast\\". According to the journalist and future Australian Test player Jack Fingleton, Ponsford was then targeted by Larwood. A month later at Brisbane, in the first Test of the series, Larwood dismissed him cheaply, twice; in the second Test, at Sydney, Ponsford scored 5 before a rapid delivery from Larwood broke a bone in his hand; Ponsford did not play again that summer.Fingleton, p. 60 England won the Brisbane Test by a record margin of 675 runs. Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings, bowling at a speed that Wisdens S.J. Southerton described as \\"faster than I have ever seen him\\". According to Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas, this bowling, which included a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs, delivered a lasting blow to Australian morale and was a major factor in England's ultimate series victory.Douglas, pp. 68‚Äì69 The match saw a low-key Test debut by Don Bradman, who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test, before being rapidly reinstated for the third.Perry, pp. 86‚Äì92 and p. 97 England maintained their ascendancy during the second, third and fourth Tests, though with decreasing victory margins; Australia finally achieved success in the last match, giving England a 4‚Äì1 series victory.Swanton, p. 34 A combination of hard pitches, stifling heat, and long matches reduced Larwood's effectiveness as the tour progressed. He finished the Test series with 18 wickets at 40.22, behind George Geary (19 at 25.11) and Jack White (25 at 30.80). In all first-class matches on the tour, Larwood took 40 wickets at 31.35; as a batsman he scored 367 runs, averaging 26.21. Larwood's occasional tactic of bowling leg theory, that is, in the direction of the batsman's legs to a concentration of leg side fielders, had been noted by the Australian former bowler Arthur Mailey. In his report on the fourth Test, Mailey wrote, Larwood resorted to his \\"famous leg theory\\" after receiving severe punishment from the Australian batsman Archie Jackson, but the change brought no success: \\"All theories and all bowlers were alike to [Jackson]\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 62 Larwood in Australia in February 1929 Southerton's tour report refers to the crowds' reactions to the England team, and in particular to the \\"barracking\\" of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions‚Äîduring the game against Victoria that took place between the fourth and fifth Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger.Larwood and Perkins, p. 63Douglas, p. 78 In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, \\"objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment\\". Larwood's view was that \\"it was a bit too thick at times ... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four- letter word you can think of was used against me\\".Hamilton, p. 120 The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians‚Äîwhich was fully reciprocated. =Bradman in 1930= Back in England for the 1929 season, Larwood made three Test appearances against the visiting South Africans, for modest returns: a total of eight wickets at 23.25, and with the bat 50 runs at 12.50. He was injured during the third Test, and thus missed the last two games of the series and several county matches. His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years; with 117 wickets at 21.66 he fell to 25th place in the national averages.Larwood and Perkins, p. 75 The 20-year-old Voce, whose fast-medium bowling style had now fully developed, was the county's most successful bowler. Together, Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier.Hamilton, pp. 102‚Äì04 Ahead of the Australians' visit to England in 1930 there was some confidence in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928‚Äì29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting.Le Quesne, pp. 15‚Äì16 England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match.Swanton, pp. 37‚Äì38 Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs. His illness meant that Larwood missed the second Test, at Lord's, which saw Australia score a record 729 for 6 including a rapid 254 from Bradman, at the time the highest individual Test score in England.Swanton, p. 39 Australia won the game by seven wickets, to draw level 1‚Äì1 in the five-match series. Larwood returned to the England side for the third Test, at Headingley, Leeds. He later claimed that his first ball to Bradman, before the batsman had scored, was a bouncer that touched the edge of the bat and was caught by the wicket-keeper, George Duckworth: \\"You could hear the snick all over the ground\\". The umpire, however, gave Bradman not out.Hamilton, p. 122 Bradman went on to compile 334, beating his record score of two weeks earlier.Perry, pp. 204‚Äì05 Larwood's one wicket in the Australian innings cost 139 runs; England were saved from probable defeat when the game was shortened by rain. The England selectors dropped Larwood from the team for the fourth Test, in which Bradman was limited to 14 runs, but the game was rained off after just over two days' play.Perry, pp. 208‚Äì10 Larwood was recalled for the final Test at the Oval that, as in 1926, would determine the series victor. In a game with no time limit, Australia replied to England's 405 with 695 (Bradman 232), then dismissed England for 251 to win by an innings and 39 runs. Larwood's single wicket‚ÄîBradman, for the first time in Tests‚Äîcost 132 runs. In the three Tests in which he played, Larwood took 4 wickets for 292; Bradman, he admitted, had \\"pasted me unmercifully\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 11 Commentators recognised the danger that Bradman presented to English hopes; the former England bowler Percy Fender, who was captain of Surrey and a respected cricket journalist, was convinced that \\"something new will have to be introduced to curb Bradman\\".Frith, p. 40 Warner was explicit: \\"England must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill\\".Frith, p. 41 =Prelude to bodyline= Apart from his treatment by Bradman, Larwood was successful in 1930, rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages (99 wickets at 16.38). He also batted well on occasions, including a not-out century against Northamptonshire. He was not selected for the 1930‚Äì31 tour of South Africa, and for the next two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket. He made one Test appearance in 1931, against New Zealand, in a rain-ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled.Frindall, p. 223 He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932, in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12.86, the best seasonal figures of his career. However, because of his poor Test record in 1930, Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932‚Äì33 tour to Australia were slim.Larwood and Perkins, pp. 76‚Äì77 The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day's play, during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket. Nevertheless, to his great relief he was selected for the tour, as was Voce, who had been England's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930‚Äì31. In 1931, with the 1932‚Äì33 series in mind, the selectors had appointed Jardine as England's captain.Le Quesne, p. 161 In his efforts to build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had hit him in the chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers;Douglas, p. 102 a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched.Hamilton, pp. 128‚Äì29 This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.Le Quesne, p, 171 Leg theory bowling was not new; Larwood, Voce and others had employed it, generally for short periods, as had several Australians including Jack Scott, who in 1928‚Äì29 dismissed Jardine and Herbert Sutcliffe using this tactic.Frith, pp. 27 What Jardine planned was a sustained leg stump attack, used in conjunction with a semicircle of close leg-side fielders ready to pounce on any mistimed shot. He found a willing ally in Carr, who, though no longer playing Test cricket, still captained Nottinghamshire and had, according to Hamilton, \\"an almost carnivorous appetite for trying to humiliate the Australians and grinding them, and especially Bradman, into the dirt\\".Hamilton, p. 132 At a private dinner at the Piccadilly Hotel, which Jardine and Carr arranged shortly after the announcement of the 1932‚Äì33 touring party, Larwood and Voce were quizzed about leg theory. Larwood later recalled the conversation thus: > Jardine asked me if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up > into the body all the time, so that Bradman had to play his shots to leg. > \\"Yes, I think that can be done\\", I said ... I had no doubt of its purpose: > we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls, and we reasoned that if > he got a lot of them he would be ... intimidated and eventually, having to > direct his shots to leg all the time, would give a catch to one of the [leg- > side] fieldsmen\\".Larwood and Perkins, pp. 80‚Äì82 In pursuit of his plans, Jardine took advice on fielding positions from Frank Foster, who had bowled a form of medium-fast leg theory during the 1911‚Äì12 series in Australia with much success, taking 32 wickets at 21.63.Frith, pp. 19‚Äì20 Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial. His priority was to contain Bradman, so \\"any scheme that would keep him in check appealed to me a great deal\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 83 In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner, Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out, with mixed results. Two Essex batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling, at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. However, Glamorgan, reckoned to be a weak batting side, scored more than 500 against the experimental attack; spectators, including the future cricket writer and commentator John Arlott, were puzzled by the ineffectiveness of the bowling. Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches.Arlott, pp. 63‚Äì64 Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, Bill Bowes bowled a series of bouncers, bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner.Swanton, p. 42 =Australian tour, 1932‚Äì33= The MCC party that sailed for Australia on 17 September 1932 contained four fast bowlers: Larwood, Voce, Bowes and G.O. \\"Gubby\\" Allen, the Middlesex amateur.Le Quesne, p. 19 Warner was manager of the side; he had captained two tours to Australia prior to 1914 and was a popular figure there.Le Quesne, p. 47 The manager's role, as the tour's historian Laurence Le Quesne remarks, was at the time less influential than that of the captain, who had absolute authority on the field of play.Le Quesne, p. 48 Prior to the Test series, the party played matches against State sides and selected Australian elevens. The intended fast leg theory attack was not revealed until the fifth of these games, against \\"An Australian XI\\" (including Bradman), which began at Melbourne on 18 November.Frith, pp. 94‚Äì98 Larwood dismissed Bradman for low scores in each of the Australian innings, writing later: \\"It was a refreshing sight to see [him] clumsily waving his bat in the air\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 100 Hobbs, who having retired from Test cricket was reporting the tour for London's The Star newspaper, thought that the bowling had shaken Bradman's confidence: \\"He was drawing away, sure proof that he didn't like the bumpers\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 101 The English tactics in the game offended the crowds and so upset H.V. Evatt (later leader of the Australian Labor Party, then a High Court judge) that he lost all desire to watch any of that year's Tests.Frith, pp. 99‚Äì102 The first Test began at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932, and was played in a tense and heated atmosphere. Bradman, whose discomfort and poor form against the tourists' bowling in the preparatory games had become sources of anxiety, was prevented from playing by illness. England won the game by 10 wickets; Larwood's match figures were 10 for 124, with only limited use of fast leg theory. The match's most successful batsman was Australia's Stan McCabe, who scored 187 in his side's first innings, attacking both the orthodox and leg theory attacks in a \\"death or glory\\" approach.Frindall, p. 232 During the match Hugh Buggy, a reporter for the Melbourne Herald, used the word \\"bodyline\\" to describe the English leg theory bowling. The term was soon universally adopted in Australia, though English sources continued to refer to \\"leg theory\\".Frith, p. 36 The second Test, at Melbourne beginning 30 December, was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace attack.Swanton, pp. 44‚Äì45 Larwood was further handicapped by pains from sore feet, caused by a new pair of boots.Douglas, p. 129 Bradman returned to the Australian side and scored a century, guiding his team to victory by 111 runs;Frindall, p. 233 his success led many commentators to suppose that fast leg theory would thenceforth prove ineffective. The series was tied 1‚Äì1 and, in the words of the writer-historian Ronald Blythe, \\"all was sweetness and light\\".Blythe, p. 142 Leslie Ames, is centre picture; Jardine is third from right The third Test, which began at Adelaide on 13 January 1933, has been characterised by Wisden as \\"probably the most unpleasant [Test match] ever played\\". Bill Woodfull, the Australian captain, was struck over the heart by a ball from Larwood and was incapacitated for several minutes. Larwood had been bowling to an orthodox field; on Woodfull's resumption, to the crowd's amazed hostility, Jardine switched to the leg theory attack. \\"What could be clearer\\", wrote Swanton, \\"than that at the root of these leg-theory tactics was the threat of physical injury?\\". Larwood then knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands, bringing further demonstrations from the crowd.Le Quesne, p. 41 Later in the innings a Larwood delivery struck Bert Oldfield on the head, causing his retirement from the match.Le Quesne, p. 50 The crowd's reaction was such that Larwood thought a full-scale invasion of the pitch might follow: \\"If one man jumps the fence the whole mob will go for us\\".Larwood and Perkins, pp. 2‚Äì3 England eventually won by 338 runs; Larwood's total of seven wickets in the match was exceeded by Allen's eight, earned by orthodox style fast bowling. While the game was still in progress, the Australian Board of Control cabled the MCC, protesting the English tactics with a direct accusation of unsportsmanlike conduct. In reply, MCC rejected the Australian Board's charges and insisted that they withdraw the charge of bad sportsmanship.Frith, pp. 218‚Äì22 The row escalated into high diplomatic and political circles, and drew in the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, the governor of South Australia, Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven, and the British Dominions secretary, J.H. Thomas. Ultimately it was decided that the matter should be referred to the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC), with a view to a possible change in the rules relating to bowling.Le Quesne, pp. 90‚Äì95 Jardine had stated that he would not lead his team in another Test unless the \\"unsportsmanlike\\" charge was withdrawn.Jardine, p. 154 On 8 February, two days before the fourth Test was due to begin at Brisbane, the Australian Board clarified that, while they continued to find bodyline objectionable, \\"we do not consider the sportsmanship of your team as being in question\\".Frith, p. 259 In the fourth Test, which England won to retain the Ashes, Larwood curtailed his use of bodyline on an unreceptive pitch.Le Quesne, p. 110Frindall, p. 235 The match passed without untoward incident; on the final day came news of the death of Archie Jackson, who had been ill for months with tuberculosis. Two days earlier he had sent Larwood a telegram: \\"Congratulations magnificent bowling good luck in all matches\\"; Larwood kept this as a souvenir for the rest of his life.Hamilton, p. 178 In the final Test, at Sydney, several Australian batsmen were hit, but their improving technique against this style of bowling enabled them to score 435, their highest innings total of the series. Larwood's main contribution to this game was as a batsman; sent in as a nightwatchman, he batted well into the following day to score 98.Swanton, p. 47 In the Australians' second innings Larwood suffered a serious injury to his left foot, the legacy of much bowling on hard, unyielding pitches. Although he could no longer bowl, Jardine would not let him leave the field while Bradman was still batting, believing that Larwood's continuing presence represented a psychological threat. When Bradman was out, he and Larwood left the field together, although no words were exchanged. England won the match to secure a 4‚Äì1 series victory.Frindall, p. 236 The injury ended Larwood's tour at that point. While the rest of the team fulfilled the final Australian fixtures before embarking on a short tour of New Zealand, Larwood returned to England on board SS Otranto.Larwood and Perkins, pp. 204‚Äì05 In the Test matches he had been England's most successful bowler, with 33 wickets at 19.52. As a batsman he had scored 145 runs, averaging 24.16. In all first-class matches on the tour he took 64 wickets at 13.89 and scored 358 runs at 23.45.Jardine, pp. 249‚Äì50 =Aftermath= On his return home, despite massive press and public interest Larwood was bound by his contract with the MCC to remain silent until the main party returned.Hamilton, pp. 185‚Äì86 On 7 May 1933, the day after their arrival, he gave in a Sunday Express article a strong defence of what he continued to call \\"leg theory\\". Woodfull, he said, was too slow, and Bradman too scared: \\"Richardson and McCabe played me all right, Woodfull and Bradman could not\\". He was highly critical of the Australian crowds who, he said, knew nothing of cricket‚Äîall they wanted was for Bradman to score runs. In mid-May, in a hastily prepared, ghost-written book entitled Bodyline? that was serialised in the Sunday Dispatch, Larwood elaborated on his themes of Australian batting failures and crowd hooliganism.Hamilton, pp. 194‚Äì95 By this time the 1933 cricket season was in full swing; bodyline bowling was being widely practised, by Bowes, Voce and by the fast bowlers in the visiting West Indies touring side, Learie Constantine and E.A. Martindale.Le Quesne, p. 244 and pp. 274‚Äì75Hamilton, pp. 208‚Äì09 Larwood's writings were inconvenient for the MCC committee which, now more aware of the intimidatory aspects of bodyline, was revising its position and was more inclined to appease Australian feelings. The injury to Larwood's foot meant that he scarcely bowled for Nottinghamshire in 1933. However, such was his drawing power that the county continued to play him as a batsman until mid-July, when his unfitness prematurely ended his season.Hamilton, pp. 206‚Äì07 Meanwhile, on 28 April the Australian Board had unilaterally adopted a regulation that specifically outlawed bodyline bowling in Australia; MCC's initial response was to declare this law impractical, but as the events of the season unfolded they modified their stance.Le Quesne, pp. 239‚Äì42 and p. 244 The ICC meeting on 31 July produced no immediate resolution, but did elicit a verbal promise from the MCC that bodyline would not be used in the projected 1934 tour by the Australians.Le Quesne, pp. 253‚Äì55 In exchanges of telegrams with the Australian Board, the MCC still contrived to avoid a specific commitment, while emphasising that they had \\"always agreed that a form of bowling which is obviously a direct attack by the bowler upon the batsman would be an offence against the spirit of the game\\".Le Quesne, p. 258 On that basis, the Australian Board agreed to the 1934 tour.Le Quesne, p. 262 By the beginning of the 1934 season Larwood was fit again, and it was anticipated that he would play in the Tests. Jardine had earlier issued an unequivocal statement that he would not play. By way of confirming their commitment not to use bodyline, the MCC committee decided that Larwood should apologise to the Australians for his bowling on the 1932‚Äì33 tour. No such apology had been requested from Jardine; Larwood refused to do so, insisting that he had bowled precisely as instructed by his captain.Frith, pp. 399‚Äì400 Shortly before the second Test, he wrote in the Sunday Dispatch that he was unrepentant about leg theory, adding: \\"I doubt if I shall ever play against [the Australians] again, at least in big cricket\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 232 Larwood's Test career thus ended. In its review of the 1934 season, Wisden commented: \\"No greater disservice was ever done to English cricket than when Larwood was induced to dash into print and become responsible for statements which put him beyond the pale of being selected for England\\". Larwood continued to play for Nottinghamshire for several more seasons, with considerable success: 82 wickets at 17.25 in 1934, 102 at 22.70 in 1935 and in 1936, his benefit season, 119 at 12.97. The 18-year-old future Test batsman Denis Compton, in his second county match for Middlesex, faced Larwood in June 1936; he later recorded that Larwood and Voce were the most accurate fast bowlers he ever faced, and that Larwood was the fastest.Compton, pp. 29‚Äì30 The benefit season yielded the then county record sum of ¬£2,098.Frith, p. 347 In the English winter of 1936‚Äì37, while an MCC team led by Allen toured Australia, Larwood took a coaching job in India. The climate and the food disagreed with him, and he returned home early.Larwood and Perkins, pp. 240‚Äì43 His bowling achievements in 1937 were modest: 70 wickets at 24.57. Larwood's relations with Nottinghamshire had steadily deteriorated since Carr's dismissal from the captaincy in 1934; his foot problem returned, and was aggravated by a cartilage injury to his left knee. In 1938, after a few matches, he left the county by mutual agreement and retired from first-class cricket.Hamilton, pp. 249‚Äì50 In his first-class career he took 1,427 wickets at 17.51, and scored 7,290 runs at 19.91 including three centuries. In Tests he took 78 wickets at 28.35 and scored 485 runs at 19.40. Retirement =Obscurity in England= After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the outbreak of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman at the end of the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall.Hamilton, pp. 270‚Äì72 The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.Larwood and Perkins, pp. 254‚Äì56 =Emigration to Australia= SS Orontes, the ship that took Jardine's party to Australia in 1932, and on which Larwood emigrated to Australia in 1950 Bert Oldfield and Harold Larwood in Australia, 14 January 1954 In the economic austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, that he would find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, and he decided to emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters.Hamilton, pp. 259‚Äì60 On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes, the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously.Hamilton, p. 263 On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.Frith, p. 439Parkinson, pp. x‚Äìxi From time to time Larwood supplemented his wages by commenting on cricket for newspapers and broadcasters.Hamilton, pp. 276‚Äì77 At first he was treated with some suspicion by English touring teams; in 1950‚Äì51 when he visited the English dressing room he received a cold reception from the England captain, F.R. Brown. Four years later, according to Larwood, he was kept out of the dressing room by Trevor Bailey, the 1954‚Äì55 team's vice captain‚Äîthough Bailey denied that this ever happened.Hamilton, p. 293 However, from the early 1960s onwards Larwood was often visited by members of England teams, and he became a regular and welcome guest in English dressing rooms. He sometimes went to cricket events where he often met Don Bradman; relations between the two, though outwardly cordial, remained essentially cold.Hamilton, pp. 302‚Äì03 In 1977 Larwood attended the Centenary Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, along with many survivors of old Ashes battles. As on similar past occasions he had to be persuaded to go; later he would describe it as \\"one of the best days of my life\\".Hamilton. pp. 305‚Äì08 His presence created considerable interest among generations of cricket followers to whom the bodyline series was distant history. Later that year he visited England, and watched England's cricketers play Australia at Trent Bridge, his old home ground; this was one of several trips he made to his home country, the last of which was in 1980.Hamilton, p. 312 In 1982, the 50th anniversary of the bodyline series was commemorated with much publicity, some of which brought a revival of hate mail and hostility towards Larwood.Hamilton, pp. 8‚Äì9 =Final years and death= Holy Trinity Church, Kingsford, where Larwood's ashes were interred As he grew older, Larwood increasingly spoke out on current cricket issues. He was particularly critical of the proliferation of protective clothing in the 1970s, and considered Ian Botham, the England all-rounder, over-rated: his bowling \\"wouldn't burst a paper bag\\". He was unimpressed by the 1984 Australian television miniseries Bodyline which he considered inaccurate and at risk of reawakening ill-feelings he thought best forgotten.Hamilton, pp. 317‚Äì20 In 1985 he was given honorary life membership of the Sydney Cricket Ground and, in England, the Larwood and Voce Stand was opened at Trent Bridge.Frith, p. 440 In June 1993, in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, Larwood was appointed an MBE for services to cricket. Of this award, Today newspaper commented: \\"At last the ruling classes honour the man who carried the can for their savage arrogance\\".Quoted in Frith, p. 440 In his final years, Larwood withdrew his claims that Bradman had been frightened of him, and acknowledged his Australian foe as the greatest batsman of all time. He was gradually losing his sight, although he retained his alertness, and on his 90th birthday was able to join in a game of garden cricket with his great- grandchildren.Hamilton, p. 342 He died in hospital on 22 July 1995, following a brief illness, in his 91st year. He was cremated, and his ashes placed in a memorial wall at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Kingsford.Hamilton, p. 329 and p. 341 A plaque with a simple inscription was placed on the wall by his daughters. His wife Lois died in 2001, and her ashes were placed alongside his.Frith, p. 441 Style and influence Larwood has been widely acknowledged as the greatest fast bowler of his generation and, according to his Wisden obituary, was \\"one of the rare fast bowlers in the game's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by the mere mention of his name\\". Timing technology was primitive in his day, but various tests indicated speeds of between 90 and 100 mph (140 to 160 km/h).Frith, p. 21 Fingleton commented that Larwood was \\"about twice as fast as anyone out there\\", indicating a match in progress at Trent Bridge. However, one Australian from an earlier cricketing generation, Ernie Jones, dismissed Larwood: \\"He wouldn't knock a dint in a pound of butter on a hot day\\". At around 5 feet 7 inches, Larwood was short for a fast bowler, although he had long arms in relation to his height.Hamilton, pp. 10‚Äì13 His lower bowling trajectory helped the ball to retain speed. His side-on bowling action, following a smooth and almost soundless approach, was described by the Manchester Guardians cricket correspondent Neville Cardus as \\"absolutely classical, left side showing down the wicket before the arm swung over with a thrilling vehement rhythm\\".Hamilton, pp. 37‚Äì39 Facing Larwood at his fastest was, according to Hamilton, \\"akin to a public stoning\\". Hobbs, who batted against him many times in county matches, thought him not just the fastest but the most accurate bowler he had ever seen. Among later fast bowlers influenced by Larwood's style was Ray Lindwall, Australia's bowling star of the 1940s and 1950s, who watched the bodyline series as a schoolboy and modelled his own action on Larwood's. Larwood claimed that he did not intend to hit batsmen, though \\"I didn't shed any crocodile tears if a batsman was hit in the thigh\\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 247 In a press interview in 1990 he further admitted that he \\"might sometimes have bowled at a batsman's ribs, but never at his head\\". He did from time to time inflict serious injuries on his opponents: Reg Sinfield of Gloucestershire, Patsy Hendren of Middlesex, and H.B. Cameron of South Africa were all carried unconscious from the field after being hit by high- speed deliveries. Many others suffered discomfort in the form of bruises and minor fractures. In Australia, in the wake of the bodyline series, a music hall song summed up many apprehensive batsmen's feelings: Notes and references ;Notes ;Citations Sources  [First published 1946]  * [First published 1965]  * External links * A 15-second clip of Larwood's run-up and delivery Filmed during the third Test at Adelaide, January 1933, this shows the ball that hit and injured Oldfield. 1904 births 1995 deaths English cricketers English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 English emigrants to Australia England Test cricketers Europeans cricketers Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Members of the Order of the British Empire North v South cricketers Nottinghamshire cricketers People from Kirkby-in-Ashfield Players cricketers Wisden Cricketers of the Year Wisden Leading Cricketers in the World H.

Sideburns, sideboards, or side whiskers are facial hair grown on the sides of the face, extending from the hairline to run parallel to or beyond the ears. The term sideburns is a 19th-century corruption of the original burnsides, named after American Civil War general Ambrose Burnside, a man known for his unusual facial hairstyle that connected thick sideburns by way of a moustache, but left the chin clean-shaven. Variations Sideburns can be worn and grown in combination with other styles of facial hair, such as the moustache or goatee, but once they extend from ear to ear via the chin they cease to be sideburns and become a beard, chinstrap beard, or chin curtain. Indigenous men of Mexico, who shaved their heads and wore their sideburns long, as well as Colombians, who wear their sideburns long and typically do not have any other facial hair, are said to be wearing \\"balcarrotas\\", rarely seen in modern times, but prized in the 16th century as a mark of virile vanity and banned by the colonial authorities in New Spain, resulting in rioting in 1692. History Following the fashion in Europe young South American criollos adopted sideburns. Many of the independence heroes of South America, including Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Bernardo O'Higgins, Jos√© Miguel Carrera, and Antonio Nari√±o had sideburns and are as such depicted on numerous paintings, coins and banknotes. Nineteenth-century sideburns were often far more extravagant than those seen today, similar to what are now called mutton chops, but considerably more extreme. In period literature, \\"side whiskers\\" usually refers to this style, in which the whiskers hang well below the jaw line (see the picture of Wilhelm I, due right). As with beards, sideburns went quickly out of fashion in the early twentieth century. In World War I, in order to secure a seal on a gas mask, men had to be clean-shaven; this did not affect mustaches. In 1936 President Franklin Roosevelt briefly experimented with sideburns on a yachting cruise, provoking laughter from wife Eleanor.\\"President Grows crop of Sideburns: Mrs. Roosevelt Laughs Heartily as He Arrives at Campobello\\". The New York Times 28 July 1936. Retrieved 9 September 2008. Sideburns made a comeback in the mid-1950s when Marlon Brando sported them as the title character in The Wild One (1953). Further spurred by Elvis Presley, sideburns were sported by \\"hoods\\", \\"greasers\\", and \\"rockers\\" seeking to highlight their rebellious post- pubescent manliness.\\"Sideburns a la Presley Aren't Ivy; Dern of Penn Quits Track Rather Than Alter Appearance\\". The New York Times, 9 February 1957. Retrieved 9 September 2008. Sideburns later gained popularity in the counterculture of the 1960s: the struggle of a New Jersey youth to wear sideburns to his public high school graduation made a newspaper article in 1967\\"Youth With Sideburns Is Graduated in Jersey\\". The New York Times, 13 June 1967. Retrieved 9 September 2008.. Sideburns were associated with young mods and hippies, but in the '70s became prevalent in all walks of life. \\"Lambchop\\" sideburns also became a symbol of the gay club scenes of San Francisco and Sydney, as did the handlebar mustache. For the most part, sideburns went out of fashion in the late 1970s. However, they have continued to be popular among rock musicians, and even become a notable feature of such musicians like Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Lemmy. Because of sideburns' multifarious history, they may be seen as stuffily Victorian; an indicator of roughness, vice, or rebelliousnessIn the 1965 novel For Kicks by Dick Francis, one character advises another that, to go undercover as a disreputable stable lad, \\"Then, if I might suggest it, it would be a good idea for you to grow a couple of sideburns. It's surprising what a lot of distrust can be caused by an inch of extra hair in front of the ears!\\" ; a characteristic of rock 'n' roll; or merely a retro fashion revival.

It was such a flop with critics and audiences that its failure discouraged production of religious epics for many years. It is considered notable in the 21st century for its astonishing landscapes, powerful and provocative cinematography, Max von Sydow's debut acting performance in an American film, and the final film performance of Claude Rains. * March 2 ‚Äì The Rodgers and Hammerstein film adaptation of The Sound of Music, directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, premieres. It quickly became a worldwide phenomenon and an instant classic. It successfully displaced Gone with the Wind to become, at the time, the highest-grossing film of all-time. The Sound of Music is credited as the film that saved and restored Twentieth Century-Fox from bankruptcy after it suffered from extremely high production costs of Cleopatra two years prior. * July 1 ‚Äì Blake Edwards's epic comedy The Great Race, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk, and Keenan Wynn, premieres. Initially a flop with critics and audiences, some do admire Edwards' direction, the acting by its ensemble cast, Henry Mancini's music and its climactic pie fight. * December 22 ‚Äì David Lean's film adaptation of Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago, starring Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger, and Alec Guinness, premieres and, like The Sound of Music, quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Its moral story and message of a love and human spirit that defied the communist Soviet Union have made the film a true classic with critics and audiences.

The equation is: ;F_D\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\tfrac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, u^2\\\\, C_D\\\\, A :F_D is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity, :\\\\rho is the mass density of the fluid,Note that for the Earth's atmosphere, the air density can be found using the barometric formula. Air is 1.293 kg/m3 at 0¬∞C and 1 atmosphere :u is the flow velocity relative to the object, :A is the reference area, and :C_D is the drag coefficient ‚Äì a dimensionless coefficient related to the object's geometry and taking into account both skin friction and form drag. If the fluid is a liquid, C_D depends on the Reynolds number; if the fluid is a gas, C_D depends on both the Reynolds number and the Mach number. The equation is attributed to Lord Rayleigh, who originally used L2 in place of A (with L being some linear dimension).See Section 7 of Book 2 of Newton's Principia Mathematica; in particular Proposition 37. The reference area A is typically defined as the area of the orthographic projection of the object on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. For non-hollow objects with simple shape, such as a sphere, this is exactly the same as a cross sectional area. For other objects (for instance, a rolling tube or the body of a cyclist), A may be significantly larger than the area of any cross section along any plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. Airfoils use the square of the chord length as the reference area; since airfoil chords are usually defined with a length of 1, the reference area is also 1. Aircraft use the wing area (or rotor-blade area) as the reference area, which makes for an easy comparison to lift. Airships and bodies of revolution use the volumetric coefficient of drag, in which the reference area is the square of the cube root of the airship's volume. Sometimes different reference areas are given for the same object in which case a drag coefficient corresponding to each of these different areas must be given. For sharp-cornered bluff bodies, like square cylinders and plates held transverse to the flow direction, this equation is applicable with the drag coefficient as a constant value when the Reynolds number is greater than 1000.Drag Force For smooth bodies, like a circular cylinder, the drag coefficient may vary significantly until Reynolds numbers up to 107 (ten million).See Batchelor (1967), p. 341.  Discussion  The equation is easier understood for the idealized situation where all of the fluid impinges on the reference area and comes to a complete stop, building up stagnation pressure over the whole area. No real object exactly corresponds to this behavior. CD is the ratio of drag for any real object to that of the ideal object. In practice a rough un-streamlined body (a bluff body) will have a CD around 1, more or less. Smoother objects can have much lower values of CD. The equation is precise ‚Äì it simply provides the definition of CD (drag coefficient), which varies with the Reynolds number and is found by experiment. Of particular importance is the u^2 dependence on flow velocity, meaning that fluid drag increases with the square of flow velocity. When flow velocity is doubled, for example, not only does the fluid strike with twice the flow velocity, but twice the mass of fluid strikes per second. Therefore, the change of momentum per second is multiplied by four. Force is equivalent to the change of momentum divided by time. This is in contrast with solid-on- solid friction, which generally has very little flow velocity dependence.  Relation with dynamic pressure  The drag force can also be specified as, F_D \\\\propto P_d A where, Pd is pressure exerted by fluid on area A. Here the pressure Pd is referred to as dynamic pressure due to kinetic energy of fluid experiencing relative flow velocity u. This is defined in similar form as kinetic energy equation: P_d = \\\\frac12 \\\\rho u^2  Derivation  The drag equation may be derived to within a multiplicative constant by the method of dimensional analysis. If a moving fluid meets an object, it exerts a force on the object. Suppose that the fluid is a liquid, and the variables involved ‚Äì under some conditions ‚Äì are the: * speed u, * fluid density œÅ, * kinematic viscosity ŒΩ of the fluid, * size of the body, expressed in terms of its frontal area A, and * drag force FD. Using the algorithm of the Buckingham œÄ theorem, these five variables can be reduced to two dimensionless groups: * drag coefficient CD and * Reynolds number Re. Alternatively, the dimensionless groups via direct manipulation of the variables. That this is so becomes apparent when the drag force FD is expressed as part of a function of the other variables in the problem: : f_a(F_D,\\\\, u,\\\\, A,\\\\, \\\\rho,\\\\, u)\\\\, =\\\\, 0. \\\\, This rather odd form of expression is used because it does not assume a one-to-one relationship. Here, fa is some (as-yet-unknown) function that takes five arguments. Now the right-hand side is zero in any system of units; so it should be possible to express the relationship described by fa in terms of only dimensionless groups. There are many ways of combining the five arguments of fa to form dimensionless groups, but the Buckingham œÄ theorem states that there will be two such groups. The most appropriate are the Reynolds number, given by : \\\\mathrm{Re}\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac{u\\\\,\\\\sqrt{A}}{ u} and the drag coefficient, given by : C_D\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac{F_D}{\\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, A\\\\, u^2}. Thus the function of five variables may be replaced by another function of only two variables: : f_b\\\\left(\\\\frac{F_D}{\\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, A\\\\, u^2},\\\\, \\\\frac{u\\\\, \\\\sqrt{A}}{ u} \\\\right)\\\\, =\\\\, 0. where fb is some function of two arguments. The original law is then reduced to a law involving only these two numbers. Because the only unknown in the above equation is the drag force FD, it is possible to express it as : \\\\frac{F_D}{\\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, A\\\\, u^2}\\\\, =\\\\, f_c\\\\left(\\\\frac{u\\\\, \\\\sqrt{A}}{ u} \\\\right) or : F_D\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\tfrac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, A\\\\, u^2\\\\, f_c(R_e), \\\\, and with C_D\\\\, =\\\\, f_c(R_e). Thus the force is simply ¬Ω œÅ A u2 times some (as-yet-unknown) function fc of the Reynolds number Re ‚Äì a considerably simpler system than the original five-argument function given above. Dimensional analysis thus makes a very complex problem (trying to determine the behavior of a function of five variables) a much simpler one: the determination of the drag as a function of only one variable, the Reynolds number. If the fluid is a gas, certain properties of the gas influence the drag and those properties must also be taken into account. Those properties are conventionally considered to be the absolute temperature of the gas, and the ratio of its specific heats. These two properties determine the speed of sound in the gas at its given temperature. The Buckingham pi theorem then leads to a third dimensionless group, the ratio of the relative velocity to the speed of sound, which is known as the Mach number. Consequently when a body is moving relative to a gas, the drag coefficient varies with the Mach number and the Reynolds number. The analysis also gives other information for free, so to speak. The analysis shows that, other things being equal, the drag force will be proportional to the density of the fluid. This kind of information often proves to be extremely valuable, especially in the early stages of a research project. Experimental methods To empirically determine the Reynolds number dependence, instead of experimenting on a large body with fast-flowing fluids (such as real-size airplanes in wind tunnels), one may just as well experiment using a small model in a flow of higher velocity because these two systems deliver similitude by having the same Reynolds number. If the same Reynolds number and Mach number cannot be achieved just by using a flow of higher velocity it may be advantageous to use a fluid of greater density or lower viscosity.

Finsbury Park Mosque is registered as a charity in England, serving the local community in Islington and the surrounding boroughs of North London. The mosque gained national attention when Abu Hamza al-Masri, a radical preacher, became its imam in 1997. In 2003, the mosque was closed by its trustees following an anti-terrorist police raid, and re-opened in 2005 under new leadership. History =1988‚Äì1997: Opening= In the 1960s a small room in a guest house at 7 Woodfall Road, London N4 was used as a Prayer Room and community centre for the handful of Bangladeshi Muslims then working and living in the district, and had become inadequate for the growing Muslim community by the time the building was compulsorily purchased by the local authority as part of a Housing Action Plan. The community formed a Muslim Welfare Centre, and in 1975 purchased its own property at St. Thomas‚Äôs Road, later also acquiring neighbouring plots. A mosque first came into use on the site in 1988, when it was one of the largest mosques in the UK. In 1994 a new 5-storey mosque building was officially opened in a ceremony attended by Prince Charles and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia who had contributed funds for the building.Inisde Finsbury Park Mosque, TIME, January 2003MacEoin, Denis. \\"The Hijacking of British Islam.\\" How extremist literature is subverting mosques in the UK (Policy Exchange 2007) (2007), page 77.Hard Law and Soft Power: Counter- Terrorism, the Power of Sacred Places, and the Establishment of an Anglican Islam , Peter W.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he consolidated his control of the mosque, with his followers preventing anyone they did not trust from entering it.Abu Hamza profile, BBC News (January 9, 2015). According to the mosque's current administration, although originally appointed by the trustees, Abu Hamza gradually took over the mosque from them. When the mosque's trustees asked him to leave, they allege that he resorted to intimidation. In October 1998, the trustees went to the High Court to stop Abu Hamza from preaching at the mosque. They were granted an injunction, but it was not enforced. Many trustees reported being barred from their own mosque by Abu Hamza's supporters and even being assaulted. In April 2002, the Charity Commission for England and Wales suspended Abu Hamza from preaching, but he continued anyway. Djamal Beghal used the mosque as his \\"base,\\" as he planned a foiled 2001 suicide bombing of the American Embassy in Paris. During Abu Hamza's control, the mosque's attendance dropped. Most of the attendees were his followers. The mosque also became a meeting point for many radical Muslims. According to classified American documents released by WikiLeaks, Finsbury Park mosque previously served \\"as a haven\\" for Islamic extremists who subsequently fought against allied forces in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda operatives including \\"shoebomber\\" Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui attended the mosque. In 2002, The Guardian reported that weapons training had taken place inside the building. On 11 September 2002, a conference was held at the mosque titled \\"A Towering Day in History\\" to praise the September 11 hijackers on the anniversary of the attack with the participation of Anjem Choudary, Abu Hamza, Omar Bakri Mohammed, Mohammad al-Massari and others.Radicals meet at north London mosque to mark 'towering day', Guardian, 12 September 2002Wiktorowicz, Quintan. \\"Joining the cause: Al-Muhajiroun and radical Islam.\\", The Roots of Islamic Radicalism conference, Yale.

In August 2004 the mosque was reopened, but after reports \\"hardliners\\" again asserted control in December 2004, the Charity Commission intervened again and appointed a new board of trustees with the support of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), who were asked by the police, the former trustees, and others to try to turn it around. After changing the locks and taking physical control of the building, the mosque was reopened under heavy police presence.New start for 'extremist' mosque, BBC, 11 February 2005 Dr. Azzam Tamimi, a leading member of MAB, described the mosque takeover as \\"one of the very rare success stories where the Muslim community and others came together and decided to rescue the mosque\\", although a minority complained of lack of consultation, with Ashgar Bukhari of the campaign group Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK saying that the committee should have been elected. The new management condemned former imam Abu Hamza. =2006‚Äì2013: Reformation= Since reopening, it is widely acknowledged that the mosque has not been associated with radical views. British authorities have described the transformation of the mosque to be a major accomplishment.

It is in the area formerly covered by the historic parish of Hornsey, succeeded by the Municipal Borough of Hornsey. It was one of the first of the great London parks laid out in the Victorian era. The park borders the residential neighbourhoods of Harringay, Finsbury Park, Stroud Green, and Manor House. Finsbury Park should not be confused with Finsbury, which is a district of Central London roughly three miles to the south, forming the south-eastern part of the London Borough of Islington. History =Before the park= The park was landscaped on the northeastern extremity of what was originally a woodland area in the Manor or Prebend of Brownswood. It was part of a large expanse of woodland called Hornsey Wood that was cut further and further back for use as grazing land during the Middle Ages. In the mid-18th century a tea room had opened on the knoll of land on which Finsbury Park is situated. Londoners would travel north to escape the smoke of the capital and enjoy the last remains of the old Hornsey Wood. Around 1800 the tea rooms were developed into a larger building which became known as the Hornsey Wood House/Tavern. A lake was also created on the top of the knoll with water pumped up from the nearby New River. There was boating, a shooting and archery range, and probably cock fighting and other blood sports. The Hornsey Wood Tavern was demolished in the process of making the area into a park, but the lake was enlarged. Once the park had opened, a pub across the road from its eastern entrance along Seven Sisters Road called itself the Hornsey Wood Tavern after the original. This pub was later renamed the Alexandra Dining Room and closed for business in April 2007. It was subsequently demolished. =Creation of the park= During the early part of the second quarter of the 19th century, following developments in Paris, Londoners began to demand the creation of open spaces as an antidote to the ever-increasing urbanisation of London. In 1841 the people of Finsbury on the northern perimeter of the City of London petitioned for a park to alleviate conditions of the poor. The present-day site of Finsbury Park was one of four suggestions for the location of a park.The Times, 9 August 1869 Originally to be named Albert Park, the first plans were drawn up in 1850. Renamed Finsbury Park, plans for the park's creation were ratified by an Act of Parliament in 1857. Despite some local opposition, the park was opened in 1869. =During the wars= During the First World War the park was known as a location for pacifist meetings. During the Second World War, the park was used as military training grounds and also hosted anti-aircraft guns. =Regeneration= Through the late 20th Century the park began to fall into a state of disrepair with most of the original features gone by the 1980s. This decline was worsened in 1986 when the then owner, Greater London Council, was wound up and ownership was passed on to Haringey Council, but without sufficient funding or a statutory obligation for the park's upkeep. A ¬£5 million Heritage Lottery Fund Award, made in 2003, enabled significant renovations including cleaning the lake, building a new cafe and children's playground and resurfacing and repairing the tennis courts. The park now contains tennis courts, a running track, a softball field and many open spaces for various leisure activities. Facilities The park has a mix of open ground, formal gardens, avenues of mature trees and an arboretum. There is also a lake, a children's play area, a cafe and an art exhibition space. Sports facilities in the park include football pitches, a cycling club, a bowling green, a skatepark, an athletics stadium, and tennis and basketball courts. Unusually for London, the park hosts two facilities for \\"American\\" sports: an American football field, home to the London Blitz, and diamonds for softball and baseball, home to the London Mets. Parkland Walk, a linear park, provides a route that links the park with Crouch Hill Park, Crouch End, and Highgate Underground station. Culture =Live music= The 2008 Rise Festival being held in Finsbury Park The park has hosted several live music performances and music festivals including: Fleadh Festival (1990-2003) , Great Xpectations Festival (1993) , Rise Festival (2006‚Äì2010) and Wireless Festival (2014 - present). =Filming= Finsbury Park has been used as a filming location for music videos such as Groove Armada's Song 4 Mutya, feature films such as Rachid Bouchareb's London River and TV Programmes such as Silent Witness.

He is known for having served both as a cavalry general in the Confederate States Army in the 1860s during the American Civil War, and then as a general in the United States Army during both the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War near the turn of the twentieth century. For much of the Civil War he served as the senior cavalry general in the Army of Tennessee and fought in most of its battles in the Western Theater. Between the Civil War and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Wheeler served multiple terms as a United States Representative from the state of Alabama as a Democrat. Early life Although of New England ancestry, Joseph Wheeler was born near Augusta, Georgia and spent most of his early life growing up with relatives in Derby, Connecticut. His parents were Joseph Wheeler and Julia Knox Hull Wheeler. He was the grandson of Brigadier General William Hull, a veteran of the American Revolution who was court-martialed for surrendering at Detroit early in the War of 1812. Despite his northern upbringing, he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point from the state of Georgia and always considered himself a Georgian and Southerner. Wheeler at West Point Wheeler entered West Point in July 1854, barely meeting the height requirement at the time for entry. He graduated on July 1, 1859, placing 19th out of 22 cadets, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons. He attended the U.S. Army Cavalry School located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and upon completion was transferred on June 26, 1860, to the Regiment of Mounted Rifles stationed in the New Mexico Territory. It was while stationed in New Mexico and fighting in a skirmish with Indians that Joseph Wheeler picked up the nickname \\"Fighting Joe.\\" On September 1, 1860, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant. Civil War =Early service= At the start of the Civil War, Wheeler entered the Confederate Army on March 16 as a first lieutenant serving in the Georgia state militia artillery, and then was assigned to Fort Barrancas off of Pensacola, Florida, reporting to Maj. Gen. Braxton Bragg. His resignation from the U.S. Army was accepted on April 22, 1861. He was ordered to Huntsville, Alabama, to take command of the newly formed 19th Alabama Infantry Regiment and was promoted to colonel on September 4. Wheeler and the 19th Alabama fought well under Bragg at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. During the Siege of Corinth in April and May, Wheeler's men on picket duty clashed repeatedly with Union patrols. Serving as acting brigade commander, Wheeler burned the bridges over the Tuscumbia River to cover the Confederate withdrawal to Tupelo, Mississippi. =Middle Tennessee= Wheeler transferred to the cavalry branch and commanded the 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the Left Wing in the Army of Mississippi from September to October. During the Kentucky Campaign, Wheeler aggressively maintained contact with the enemy. He began to suffer from poor relations with the Confederacy's arguably greatest cavalryman, Nathan Bedford Forrest, when Bragg reassigned most of Forrest's men to Wheeler, sending Forrest to Murfreesboro to recruit a new brigade. Wheeler fought at the Battle of Perryville in October and after the fight performed an excellent rearguard action protecting the army's withdrawal. He was promoted to brigadier general on October 30 and led the cavalry belonging to the Second Corps of the Army of Tennessee from November to December. During action at La Vergne, Tennessee, on November 27, Wheeler was wounded by an artillery shell that exploded near him. In December 1862, the Union Army of the Cumberland began to advance from Nashville against Bragg's army and Wheeler, now commanding all of the Army of Tennessee's cavalry, skirmished aggressively to delay their advance. He drove into the rear of the Union army, destroying hundreds of wagons and capturing more than 700 prisoners. After the Battle of Stones River, as Bragg's army withdrew to the Duck River line, Wheeler struck the Union supply lines at Harpeth Shoals on January 12‚Äì13, burning three steamboats and capturing more than 400 prisoners. Bragg recommended that Wheeler be promoted as a \\"just reward\\" and he became a major general on January 20, 1863. Wheeler led the army's Cavalry Corps from January to November 24, then again from December to November 15, 1864. For his actions on January 12‚Äì13, 1863, Wheeler and his troopers received the Thanks of the Confederate Congress on May 1, 1863. In February 1863, Wheeler and Forrest attacked Fort Donelson at Dover, Tennessee, but they were repulsed by the small Union garrison. Forrest angrily told Wheeler \\"Tell [General Bragg] that I will be in my coffin before I will fight again under your command.\\" Bragg dealt with this rivalry in the Tullahoma Campaign by assigning Wheeler to guard the army's right flank while Forrest guarded the left. A Union cavalry advance on Shelbyville on June 27 trapped Wheeler and 50 of his men on the north side of the Duck River, forcing Wheeler to plunge his horse over a 15-foot embankment and escape through the rain-swollen river. =Chickamauga and Chattanooga= Joseph Wheeler during the Civil War Wheeler and his troopers guarded the army's left flank at Chickamauga in September 1863, and after the routed Union Army collected in Chattanooga, Gen. Bragg sent Wheeler's men into central Tennessee to destroy railroads and Federal supply lines in a major raid. On October 2 his raid at Anderson's Cross Roads (also known as Powell's Crossroads) destroyed more than 700 Union supply wagons, tightening the Confederates siege on Chattanooga. Pursued by his Union counterparts, Wheeler advanced to McMinnville and captured its 600-man garrison. There were more actions at Murfreesboro and Farmington, but by October 9 Wheeler had safely crossed the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The extensive raid and a subsequent northern movement to assist Longstreet in his siege of Knoxville, would cause the mounted arm of the army to miss the battles for Chattanooga (November 23‚Äì25). Wheeler covered Bragg's retreat from Chattanooga following the Union breakthrough at Missionary Ridge on November 25 and received a wound in his foot as his cavalry and Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's infantry fought at the Battle of Ringgold Gap on November 27. =Georgia and the Carolinas= During Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign Wheeler's cavalry corps screened the flanks of the Army of Tennessee as Gen. Joseph E. Johnston drew back from several positions toward Atlanta. In July, Sherman sent two large cavalry columns to destroy the railroads supplying the defenders of Atlanta. With fewer than 5,000 cavalrymen, Wheeler defeated the enemy raids, resulting in the capture of one of the two commanding generals, Maj. Gen. George Stoneman (the highest ranking Union prisoner of war). In August, Wheeler's corps crossed the Chattahoochee River in an attempt to destroy the railroad Sherman was using to supply his force from Chattanooga. Wheeler's men captured the town of Dalton, but he was unable to defeat the Union garrison, which was protected in a nearby fort. Wheeler then took his men into East Tennessee, crossing the Tennessee River above Knoxville. His raid continued to the west, causing minor interruptions in the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and then continued south through Franklin until he recrossed the Tennessee at Tuscumbia. The raid Wheeler was ordered to undertake was described by historian Ed Bearss as a \\"Confederate disaster\\" because it caused minimal damage to the Union while denying Gen. John Bell Hood, now in command of the Army of Tennessee, the direct support of his cavalry arm. Without accurate intelligence of Sherman's dispositions, Hood was beaten at Jonesborough and forced to evacuate Atlanta. Wheeler rendezvoused with Hood's army in early October after destroying the railroad bridge at Resaca. That said, the blame for this defeat cannot be laid at Wheeler's feet. In late 1864, Wheeler's cavalry did not accompany Hood on his Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign back into Tennessee and was virtually the only effective Confederate force to oppose Sherman's March to the Sea to Savannah. However, his resistance to Sherman did little to comfort Georgia civilians, and lax discipline within his command caused great dissatisfaction. Robert Toombs was quoted as saying, \\"I hope to God he will never get back to Georgia.\\" Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill wrote that \\"the whole of Georgia is full of bitter complaints of Wheeler's cavalry.\\" Wheeler and his men continued to attempt to stop Sherman in the 1865 Carolinas Campaign. He defeated a Union cavalry force under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick in South Carolina at the Battle of Aiken on February 11. He was replaced as cavalry chief by Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton and fought under him at the Battle of Bentonville on March 19‚Äì20. While attempting to cover Confederate President Jefferson Davis's flight south and west in May, Wheeler was captured at Conyer's Station just east of Atlanta. He had intended to reach the Trans-Mississippi and Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, still resisting out west, and had with him three officers from his staff and 11 privates when he was taken. Wheeler was imprisoned for two months, first at Fort Monroe and then in solitary confinement at Fort Delaware, where he was paroled on June 8. During his career in the Confederate States Army, Wheeler was wounded three times, lost 36 staff officers to combat, and a total of 16 horses were shot from under him. Military historian Ezra J. Warner believed that Wheeler's actions leading cavalry in the conflict \\"were second only to those of Bedford Forrest\\". U.S. Congress Wheeler's former residence in Washington, D.C. After the war, Wheeler became a planter and a lawyer near Courtland, Alabama, where he married and raised a family. His home, Pond Spring, in an area now known as Wheeler, Alabama, is a historic site owned by the Alabama Historical Commission. In 1880, Wheeler was elected from Alabama as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives. Wheeler's opponent, Greenback incumbent William M. Lowe, contested the election, and after a contentious legal battle which lasted over a year, Lowe was declared the winner and assumed the seat on June 3, 1882. Lowe, however, served only four months before dying of tuberculosis. Wheeler won a special election to return and serve out the remaining weeks of the term. Wheeler supported the election of Luke Pryor in 1882 and did not run for reelection, but was elected again in 1884, and re-elected to seven subsequent terms before resigning in 1900. While in Congress, Wheeler strove to heal the breach between the North and the South, and championed economic policies that would help rebuild the Southern states. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Roosevelt is on the right, Leonard Wood is next to him and bearded former Civil War Confederate general Joseph Wheeler is standing in front. Taylor MacDonald is on the far left and Major Alexander Oswald Brodie is next to him. In 1898, Wheeler, now aged 61, volunteered for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, receiving an appointment to major general of volunteers from President William McKinley. He assumed command of the cavalry division, which included Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, and was nominally second-in-command of the Fifth Army Corps. He sailed for Cuba and was charged with scouting for the U.S. advance by General William Rufus Shafter, overall commander of V Corps. He was ordered not to engage the enemy on his own until the American troop disembarkation had been completed. Approaching Las Guasimas de Sevilla on June 24, American reports suggested the Spaniards were digging in with a field gun; however, Cuban scouts contradicted these, revealing the Spaniards were preparing to abandon their position. In fact, the Spanish troops at the position had received orders to fall back on Santiago. Wheeler requested the assistance of the attached Cuban forces in an immediate attack, but their commander, Col. Gonzales Clavel, refused. Wheeler decided to attack anyway, rushing his men forward with two guns to the front, with Colonel Young's brigade leading the advance against the Spanish columns in what came to be called the Battle of Las Guasimas, the first major engagement of the war. During the excitement of the battle, Wheeler is said to have called out \\"Let's go, boys! We've got the damn Yankees on the run again!\\" Wheeler's forces moved to encircle the Spaniards' first battle line, assaulting its front and right flank, but were repelled. During a pause in the fighting, both sides reinforced their positions. The Spaniards sent forward two companies of the San Fernando Battalion, along with the artillery. After midday the U.S. attack was renewed, but Spanish Comandante Andr√©s Alca√±iz, leading the Provisional de Puerto Rico Battalion, once again checked the American assault. After halting the American advance, the Spanish resumed their ongoing withdrawal towards Santiago's outer defenses according to their original plans. The battle had cost U.S. forces 17 dead and 52 wounded, while Spanish forces suffered seven dead and seven wounded. Wheeler fell seriously ill during the campaign and turned over command of the division to Brig. Gen. Samuel S. Sumner. Wheeler was still incapacitated in July when the Battle of San Juan Hill began but once he heard the sound of guns, the \\"War Child\\" returned to the front despite his illness. Being the senior officer present at the front he first issued orders to the 1st Division, under Jacob F. Kent, before returning to his own command. Upon taking the heights, Wheeler assured General William R. Shafter that the position could be held against a possible counterattack. He led the division through the Siege of Santiago and was a senior member of the peace commission. Wheeler's youngest son died shortly after his return from serving in Cuba; he drowned while swimming in the ocean. When back in the United States, Wheeler commanded the convalescent camp of the army at Montauk Point, now a state park in New York. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Wheeler sailed for the Philippines to fight in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, arriving in August 1899. He commanded the First Brigade in Arthur MacArthur's Second Division during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War until January 1900. During this period, Wheeler was mustered out of the volunteer service and commissioned a brigadier general in the regular army, reentering the organization he had resigned from over 39 years before, both on June 16, 1900. After hostilities he commanded the Department of the Lakes until his retirement on September 10, 1900, and moved to New York. Supposedly while serving in the Philippines, Wheeler encountered an infantryman who was complaining about the heat and being tired. Wheeler promptly dismounted, took the man's rifle and pack, told him to mount his horse, and marched the rest of the way with the infantry. Later life Wheeler in later life Wheeler was the author of several books on military history and strategy, as well as about civil subjects. His first was A Revised System of Cavalry Tactics, for the Use of the Cavalry and Mounted Infantry, C.S.A. in 1863, a manual that saw use by the Confederacy. His other works include: Fitz-John Porter in 1883, The Santiago Campaign in 1898, Confederate Military History: Alabama in 1899, and Report on the Island of Guam in 1900. Wheeler also co-wrote several more books throughout the rest of his life, the last of which, The New America and the Far East: A Pictureque and Historic Description of These Lands and Peoples, was published in 1907, after his death. Wheeler also appeared in an early film called Surrender of General Toral (1898) with William Rufus Shafter. While attending the hundredth anniversary celebration of the U.S. Military Academy (West Point, New York) in 1902, Wheeler approached the old West Point hotel, where his Confederate comrades James Longstreet and Edward Porter Alexander were seated on the porch. At the festivities Wheeler wore his dress uniform of his most recent rank, that of a general in the U.S. Army. Longstreet recognized him coming near, and reportedly said, \\"Joe, I hope that Almighty God takes me before he does you, for I want to be within the gates of hell to hear Jubal Early cuss you in the blue uniform.\\" (Longstreet did in fact predecease Wheeler, dying in January 1904.) General Wheeler was a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution (joined in 1898) and the Society of Colonial Wars. After long illness, Wheeler died in Brooklyn on January 25, 1906, at the age of 69. He is one of the few former Confederate officers to be buried within Arlington National Cemetery. Legacy National Statuary Hall Collection statue of Wheeler In 1925, the state of Alabama donated a bronze statue of Joseph Wheeler to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. Additionally, several locations in Alabama are named after Wheeler including Joe Wheeler State Park, Wheeler Lake and Dam, and the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge. Also, Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia, and Wheeler County, Georgia are named after him. During World War II, the United States Navy named a Liberty Ship in honor of Wheeler. Wheeler Road, a main thoroughfare through west Augusta is named after him as well. Furthermore, Joe Wheeler Electric Cooperative in northwest Alabama also honors him. Also Camp Wheeler, near Macon, Georgia (which served as an army base during both World Wars) was named for Wheeler. The City of Derby, Connecticut, where Wheeler grew up, named him as one of the first members of its Hall of Fame in 2007.

He was chairman of the BBC from 2004 to 2006 and executive chairman of ITV plc from 2007 to 2009. Since 2011, he has been a Conservative Party life peer in the House of Lords. Early life Grade was born into a Jewish show business family originally called Winogradsky; his father was the theatrical agent Leslie Grade and his uncles were the impresarios Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont. When he was three years old his mother left the family to conduct a relationship with wrestling commentator Kent Walton. Grade was brought up by his grandmother, and only saw his non-Jewish mother once more as an adult.Michael Freedland \\"Interview: Michael Grade\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 10 March 2011 He was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire and St Dunstan's College in London. Career Grade joined the Daily Mirror in 1960, and was a sports columnist from 1964 to 1966. By his own account (as related on Channel 4 chat show The Late Clive James), the job had been organised by his father. When Leslie Grade suffered a serious stroke in 1966, the 23-year-old Michael moved into his theatrical business. In 1969, he moved to London Management & Representation. Among the artists whom Grade represented were Morecambe and Wise (he successfully negotiated the duo's defection from ATV to BBC2 in 1968) and Larry Grayson. =LWT= Grade entered the television industry in 1973 when he joined London Weekend Television (LWT) as Deputy Controller of Programmes (Entertainment).Steve Bryant \\"Grade, Michael (1943- )\\" in Horace Newcomb (ed.) Encyclopedia of Television], Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2004, pp. 1020‚Äì21 During this time he bought the scripts of an Afro-American sitcom Good Times which had an all- black cast.Howard Malchow Special Relations: The Americanization of Britain?, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2011, p.189 Adapted as The Fosters (1976‚Äì77), it became the first British sitcom to have an entirely black cast. At LWT, Grade worked with both John Birt and Greg Dyke. After he became Director of Programmes in 1977, Grade commissioned the series Mind Your Language, but later cancelled it. At an event at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1985, he agreed that the series was racist, and said that \\"it was really irresponsible of us to put it out\\".Sarita Malik Representing Black Britain: Black and Asian Images on Television, Thousand Oaks, California: Sage, 2002, p.97 In what was termed 'Snatch of the Day' by the press in 1978, Grade attempted the acquisition of exclusive screening rights to Football League matches. Previously the BBC had held the more desirable rights, but the Office of Fair Trading intervened, and Grade's purchase was revoked. The package of recorded highlights on Saturday evenings now alternates each season between ITV and the BBC.Tim Bradford When Saturday Comes, London: Penguin, 2005, pp. 882‚Äì83 Also in 1978, Grade managed to place under contract the entertainer Bruce Forsyth who had helped the BBC to dominate the Saturday evening television ratings through the decade via The Generation Game series.

Cook Dennis Potter: A Life on Screen, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998, pp. 102‚Äì3 The corporate association proved short- lived, with both sides having insufficient experience for budgeting drama shot on film, and was terminated by Grade in the summer of 1980.Cook Dennis Potter, pp. 194‚Äì97 Only three of what had been projected as six filmed plays by Potter were shot and screened.Humphrey Carpenter Dennis Potter, London: Faber, 1999 [1998], p.394 Grade though, was directly involved with some of the playwright's later commissions. Grade approved production of The Professionals and initiated the long-running arts' programme The South Bank Show.Rowena Mason \\"Michael Grade at ITV: it seemed like a good idea at the time\\", Daily Telegraph, 23 April 2009 In 1981, Grade left LWT to begin a two-year period as the president of Embassy Television in the United States. In The Times he was quoted as stating, \\"It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; it is, if you like, a gamble I want to take\\". His pay rose from ¬£32,000 to $250,000 per annum.Janine Gibson and Maggie Brown \\"Amid the suits, a man who stands out\\", The Guardian, 3 April 2004 During this time he was largely involved in developing and selling sitcoms in this period: \\"When you read 30 or 40 comedy scripts a week, you get a bit barking.\\" Grade produced for the only time in his career his only series, a nine-part adaptation of Kane and Abel, the novel by Jeffrey Archer. In a Jewish Chronicle interview with Michael Freedland in 2011, Grade said he had \\"missed public service broadcasting, real drama, news, current affairs\\". =BBC= Grade joined BBC Television in early summer 1984, becoming Controller of BBC 1 on 1 September,Top job for Grade at BBC 1: The Times (London, England), Thursday, 31 May 1984Early-evening ratings war likely if BBC replaces 'Sixty Minutes. Hewson, David The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 6 June 1984, p.3. taking, as he told Michael Freedland, \\"the biggest pay cut in history\\"; his salary went down from $500,000, excluding large bonuses, to ¬£37,000 a year. Later he became Director of Programmes in 1986, and Managing Director Designate in 1987. His tenure as Controller was controversial. Grade cancelled the rights to screen Dallas while fighting Thames Television for the rights to the series (although this decision was subsequently reversed). He cut short the expensive serialisation of The Tripods trilogy, written by John Christopher, because he was dissatisfied with the ratings it had achieved after two seasons. He also considered cancelling the sitcom Blackadder, judging the first series to be unfunny. In exchange for renewing Blackadder, he required that it become a wholly studio-based production on a lower budget.Mark Lewisohn , BBC Guide to Comedy (c.2003) via the Wayback Machine Grade agreed to commission Dennis Potter's serial The Singing Detective (1986) after a brief meeting with Jonathan Powell, then the BBC's Head of Drama.Neil Midgley \\"Michael Grade: 'I think the BBC has become too bureaucratic'\\", Radio Times, 2 April 2012 It was a highlight of this period, but came under criticism from Mary Whitehouse and the tabloid press for its content.Carpenetr Dennis Potter, pp. 455‚Äì56 Referring to the depiction of an illicit sexual encounter in Episode Three, Grade said: \\"There are very few people in television drama that you are prepared to trust with scenes like this. But Dennis Potter is one of them\\".Cited in Cook Dennis Potter: A Life on Screen, p.242 During his time as Controller, Grade was also responsible for purchasing the Australian soap opera Neighbours for BBC1's new daytime schedule; it debuted on British television on 27 October 1986. He was also responsible for repeating Neighbours, at first exclusively an afternoon programme, in a later timeslot (on the advice of his daughter, Alison, who was annoyed that she could not watch it due to her being at school). This proved to be a successful scheduling decision, with audiences in excess of 18 million for the new 5.35 pm broadcasts. Other successes during Grade's tenure included the debut of soap operas EastEnders and Howards' Way in 1985 and the hospital drama Casualty in 1986. He was also praised by Bob Geldof for agreeing to broadcast the charity rock concert Live Aid for 24 hours. In 1985 he decided to end screening beauty pageants, stating they were \\"an anachronism, verging on the offensive\\". Doctor Who controversy It was announced in February 1985 that the next series of Doctor Who, scheduled to run from January 1986, would be postponed as Grade had decided that the programme's budget would be better spent on other drama productions.Stephen Cook \\"Doctor Who fans upset as BBC postpones new series\\", The Guardian, 28 February 1985 (website reprint: 28 February 2012) What became an 18-month hiatus for Doctor Who (the series did not resume until September 1986) prompted a strong reaction from viewers. Grade was also noted for his strong dislike of the series, such as in an interview in 2004, where he said: \\"I thought it was horrible, awful. I thought it was so outdated. It was just a little show for a few pointy head Doctor Who fans. It was also very violent and it had lost its magic\\". In an appearance on the BBC's Room 101 in 2002, Grade chose the series as one of his hates, criticised its production values and said that he had little interest in, or sympathy for, science fiction. Eric Saward, the script editor of Doctor Who at the time of its suspension, responded to Grade's criticism a few years later.During the audio commentary of the 2008 DVD of the Doctor Who serial Warriors of the Deep. In his view, Grade's comments were unfair because he was in the position to allocate more resources to the programme and thus improve its quality. However, actress Katy Manning, who had portrayed a companion of Jon Pertwee's Doctor, praised Grade's treatment of the series on the DVD commentary for The Mind of Evil (1971). In her view, Grade \\"was actually doing the right thing\\", and she credited the long break prior to 2005 with rejuvenating the series.Voice-over commentary on the BBC DVD \\"The Mind of Evil\\" (1971, 2013) In 1986, Grade decided that the 24th season of Doctor Who could only happen on the condition that Colin Baker was removed from the title role. Years later Grade stated that he thought Baker's portrayal of the Doctor was \\"utterly unlikeable; absolutely God-awful in fact\\". However, his immediate predecessor in the role, Peter Davison, argued in 2018 that the decision to dismiss Baker was more to do with the executives wanting to get rid of the series' producer, John Nathan-Turner, saying: \\"I was upset about what happened, really ‚Äì because, first of all, it wasn't to do with Colin, I know that. It was to do with other issues. The power structure in the BBC had changed and they didn't want John Nathan-Turner around is the truth of it.\\" Following the end of the first series of the revived Doctor Who in 2005, he wrote a letter to Mark Thompson, the BBC Director General, congratulating all involved in the production on its success, signing-off with \\"PS never dreamed I would ever write this. Must be going soft!\\" In an interview for Radio Times in 2012, Grade commented: \\"From clunky Daleks that couldn't go up and down stairs to the filmic qualities today of Doctor Who, it's a transformation... The show still leaves me cold, but I admire it, which I never did before.\\" =Channel 4= Grade accepted the post of chief executive of Channel 4, succeeding Jeremy Isaacs, and taking up his post at the beginning of 1988. It was a decision which led Isaacs to criticise the appointment and to threaten to \\"throttle\\" Grade if the nature of the Channel was altered.Howell Raines \\"London: Will Mrs. Thatcher Squeeze the Beeb? Will British TV Be Americanized? Stay Tuned . . . \\", The New York Times, 20 December 1987 He phased out some of its more high-brow programming, for which he was accused of \\"dumbing down\\"; Grade stated that in the same week that he moved to Channel 4, it had shown a repeat of the 1984 adaptation of The Far Pavilions, featuring American actress Amy Irving \\"blacked up\\" as an Indian princess. During this period, he was also criticised by the conservative press: Daily Mail columnist Paul Johnson dubbed him Britain's \\"pornographer-in-chief\\". In addition to securing talent from the BBC, he recognised the improving quality of US television output, making series such as Friends and ER the mainstays of the channel's schedule. Grade became involved in a dispute with Chris Morris regarding the satire Brass Eye after repeatedly intervening in the production to order edits to various episodes, and rescheduling some instalments for sensitivity. Morris responded by inserting a frame stating \\"Grade is a cunt\\" into the final episode of the first run.\\"In pictures: Michael Grade's highs and lows\\", The Guardian, 23 April 2009 In 1997, Grade left Channel 4 in order to head First Leisure Corporation but departed two years later following a substantial internal re- structuring. His next job was as the chairman of the new Pinewood and Shepperton film studios company. =Return to the BBC= Grade was on the board of the poorly received Millennium Dome project, and has served as chairman of Octopus Publishing, the Camelot Group, and Hemscott (a position that he intends to relinquish). He had ambitions to become Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors in 2001, but was beaten to the post by Gavyn Davies. Following Davies' resignation in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry report, it was announced on 2 April 2004 that Grade had been appointed BBC Chairman; his only demand was that he would not have to give up his job as a director of Charlton Athletic F.C. He took up his post on 17 May. On 19 September 2006, Grade became non-executive chairman of online food delivery company Ocado. He resigned from the role on 23 January 2013, after which he was replaced by Sir Stuart Rose. =ITV= On 28 November 2006, Grade and the BBC confirmed that he was to resign from his position within the corporation to replace Sir Peter Burt as Chairman, and Charles Allen as Chief Executive, of one of the companies forming part of its commercial rival, ITV. He became Executive Chairman of ITV plc on 8 January 2007. During Grade's tenure, ITV has struggled with falling advertising revenue and viewing figures. Upon appointment, Grade announced that his first priority would be to work as a senior partner at ITV Network Limited to improve ITV programming, as well as strengthen its digital channels, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. On 12 September 2007, Grade announced a controversial five-year re-structuring plan for ITV plc-owned regions, selecting entertainment as the top priority. A major overhaul of ITV plc's regional structure was also proposed. The plans would result in the consolidation of the ITV regional news programmes in England, with regions now broadcasting a single service per region rather than multiple, specialised, local services (for example, ITV Yorkshire would no longer broadcast in separate Northern and Southern regions). They would also merge fully ITV Border with ITV Tyne Tees, and ITV West with ITV Westcountry, effectively ending two regions' tenure as independent players within ITV; the proposals have been criticised by BECTU and the National Union of Journalists. Any such changes would be subject to approval by Ofcom. In March 2009, Grade initiated libel action against another television executive, Greg Dyke, and The Times newspaper over allegations of improper conduct made by Dyke about Grade, relating to his move from the BBC to ITV in 2006. The newspaper subsequently withdrew the allegations and published an apology, admitting that the allegations had no justification. On 23 April 2009, Grade announced he would be stepping down as chief executive to become non-executive chairman at the conclusion of regulatory reviews into advertising contract rights and digital TV, at some point before the end of 2009. Personal life Grade was appointed a CBE in 1998. That same year, he published his autobiography, It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time, and married his third wife, Francesca Leahy; they have a son, Samuel. He was previously married to Penelope Jane Levinson (1967‚Äì81; she is now the wife of writer and historian Sir Max Hastings), by whom he has two children, and Sarah Lawson (1982‚Äì91), a film producer. Grade is a fan of Charlton Athletic F.C. Grade revealed his membership of the Conservative Party for the first time in May 2010. On 25 January 2011, he was created a life peer, as Baron Grade of Yarmouth, of Yarmouth in the County of Isle of Wight. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 27 January and sits as a Conservative.

The September 11 attacks transformed the first term of President George W. Bush and led to what he has called the war on terror. The accuracy of describing it as a \\"war\\" and its political motivations and consequences are the topic of strenuous debate. The U.S. government increased military operations, economic measures and political pressure on groups which it accused of being terrorists, as well as increasing pressure on the governments and countries which were accused of sheltering them. October 2001 saw the first military action initiated by the US. Under this policy, the NATO invaded Afghanistan in order to remove the Taliban regime (which harbored al- Qaeda) and capture al-Qaeda forces. Critics point out that the Afghan conflict has contributed to the destabilization of neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan itself is far from at peace‚ÄîLord Ashdown, British diplomat and former international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, has gone as far as to describe the country as \\"a failed state\\". The US government has also asserted that the US invasion of Iraq is connected to 9/11.President Bush said \\"The battle of Iraq is one victory in a war on terrorism that began on September 11, 2001...\\" , and the disco dancer Vice President Dick Cheney suggested that Iraq was involved in the September 11 attacks during a \\"Meet the Press\\" interview: Iraq is \\"the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9-11\\" (Knight- Ridder October 3, 2003, archived at ). Also, the US government has continued to maintain that the war on Iraq is critical to the American \\"War on Terrorism\\". \\"In the war on terrorism, Iraq is now the central front...\\" said President Bush on December 14, 2005.  Immediate  =Rescue and recovery= Satellite image of the World Trade center site after the attacks with the location of the Twin Towers and other in the complex superimposed over the debris field Because of the events that took place on September 11, 2001, American society as a whole suffered dramatically. Recovery took years, and the economy declined drastically after the attacks. Various first responders came together that day to unite and help as much as possible. Whether they were police officers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, or ordinary civilians, the main objective was to cooperate and help the wounded. More than 1,500 first responders, ironworkers, engineers, heavy equipment operators and other workers worked at Ground Zero to attempt to find survivors and clean up the wreckage. Cranes and bulldozers were brought in along with search and rescue dogs in order to locate survivors and bodies of the deceased, however, operations were hindered by the presence of approximately two feet of soot at the site, which obscured objects and bodies. Fires burned amidst the rubble of the World Trade Center for weeks after the attack. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, only 20 survivors were pulled alive from the rubble, although there were a number of human remains and belongings that were removed from the site. The day after the attack, then-mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters that they were receiving mobile phone calls from people trapped in the debris. The task of removing debris and rubble continued well into 2002, with some 108,000 truckloads of 1.8 million tons of rubble removed by May 2002.  Hazards  Outside of the general hazards due to fires, falling debris, heavy machinery, broken metal, and the hazardous air conditions, there were also hidden concerns within the clean up zone. The parking garage under the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks held nearly 2,000 automobiles, which each held an estimated 5 gallons of gasoline, which could ignite and explode. Other concerns were around buried fuel tanks that were located on the site, and the 1.2 million rounds of ammunition that were housed at Building 6 for the use of the U.S. Customs Service. =US public reaction= September 13, 2001: A New York City firefighter looks up at what remains of the South Tower. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, George W. Bush's job approval rating soared to 86%. On September 20, 2001, the president spoke before the nation and a joint-session of Congress, regarding the events of that day, the intervening nine days of rescue and recovery efforts, and his intent in response to those events in going after the terrorists who orchestrated the attacks. In the speech, he characterized the speech itself as being akin to the President's customary State of the Union address. The attacks also had immediate and overwhelming effects upon the United States population. People began rallying around the popularized phrase, \\"United We Stand,\\" in hopes of being resilient and keeping the American spirit alive in the face of a devastating attack. The majority of the US population rallied behind President Bush and the federal government in widespread support to the recovery and the expectant reaction to the attacks. The highly visible role played by Rudy Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, won him high praise nationally and in New York City. He was named Person of the Year by Time magazine for 2001, and at times had a higher profile in the US than President George W. Bush. Two major public reactions to the attacks were a surge of public expressions of patriotism not seen since World War II, marked most often by displays of the American flag; and an unprecedented level of respect, sympathy, and admiration for New York City and New Yorkers as a group by Americans in other parts of the United States. Some criticized this particular reaction, noting that not everyone who died was from New York City (for example, some of the passengers on the planes), and that the Arlington, Virginia community also suffered in the attacks. Many people joined together to help the victims. Gratitude toward uniformed public-safety workers, and especially toward firefighters, was widely expressed in light of both the drama of the risks taken on the scene and the high death toll among the workers. Many people paid tribute to the police officers and fire fighters who died during the attacks by wearing NYPD and FDNY hats. The number of casualties among the emergency service personnel was unprecedented. Blood donations saw a surge in the weeks after 9/11. According to a report by the Journal of the American Medical Association, \\"...the number of blood donations in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks was markedly greater than in the corresponding weeks of 2000 (2.5 times greater in the first week after the attacks; 1.3‚Äì1.4 times greater in the second to fourth weeks after the attack).\\"Glynn, Simone A. \\"Effect of a National Disaster on Blood Supply and Safety: The September 11 Experience .\\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 289, 2246‚Äì2253. At the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show that took place in New York in February 2002, a tribute was paid to the search and rescue dogs who not only assisted in locating survivors and bodies from the rubble, but were also inside the World Trade Center buildings before they collapsed. Backlash and hate crimes In the weeks following the attacks, there was a surge in incidents of harassment and hate crimes against South Asians, Middle Easterners, and anyone thought to be \\"Middle Eastern-looking\\" people‚Äîparticularly Sikhs, because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically and erroneously associated with Muslims by many Americans. Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh man, was one of the first victims of this backlash; he was shot dead on September 15 at the gas station he owned in Mesa, Arizona. Mark Anthony Stroman, a white supremacist, killed two men and injured a third in a shooting spree beginning September 15 in Dallas, Texas. His victims, including Bangladeshi American Rais Bhuiyan, were all targeted because they looked \\"of Muslim descent\\". His motive for the killings was revenge for the 9/11 attacks. On July 20, 2011, Stroman was executed for the crime. In many cities there were reports of vandalism against mosques and other Islamic institutions, including some cases of arson. In the year after the attack, anti-Muslim hate crimes jumped 1,600 percent and this is further aggravated by a climate of prejudice that manifests in different ways. The only death officially recorded as a homicide in New York City on September 11 was Henryk Siwiak, a Polish immigrant who was shot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. While he had taken a wrong turn on his way to a new job onto a street known for high rates of robbery and drug dealing, his family has theorized he may have been the victim of a hate crime in the wake of the attacks, since he was wearing camouflage clothing, had dark hair and spoke imperfect, heavily accented English‚Äîall of which may have led someone to believe he had something to do with the attackers. The case remains unsolved; police are open to the family's theory but have not classified the killing as a bias crime. In 2008, author Moustafa Bayoumi released the book How Does It Feel to Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America. The author says mass arrests and deportations of Arabs and Arab Americans were conducted by the various government organizations, including the FBI, often with insufficient evidence to connect them to terrorism; that some were incarcerated indefinitely without notifying the detainee's relatives, as if they had just disappeared. Bayoumi maintains deportation of Arabs and Arab- Americans significantly increased following 9/11, often at short notice, saying in one case a man was deported without his clothes.  Long-term effects  =Effects on children= The attacks were regarded by some as particularly disturbing to children, in part because of the frequency with which the images were replayed on television. Many schools closed early, especially those with children whose parents worked in Washington, D.C. and New York City. In Sarasota, Florida, Emma E. Booker Elementary School became a part of history, as President George W. Bush was reading to a classroom of children there when the attacks happened. Psychological studies focused on children exposed to the attacks in Lower Manhattan and New York City found higher rates of clinically significant behavior problems among preschool children, as well as elevated rates of PTSD and depression in the years after the attacks. For children who lost a parent in the attack, psychologists noticed that while some coped well initially, they would at times succumb to bouts of depression and self harm later in life, or become reluctant to discuss their family history. =Health effects= The thousands of tons of toxic debris resulting from the collapse of the Twin Towers contained more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens. Subsequent debilitating illnesses among rescue and recovery workers are said to be linked to exposure to these carcinogens. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security; however, the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002. Health effects also extended to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims' names will be included in the World Trade Center memorial. As of January 1, 2002 the New York Police Department had received 37 disability claims, and the Fire Department reported 269 disability claims related to injuries suffered as a result of the attacks. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust. By 2004, nearly half of more than 1,000 screened rescue-and-recovery workers and volunteers reported new and persistent respiratory problems, and more than half reported persistent psychological symptoms. Because of the long latency period between exposure and development of asbestos-related diseases, exposed Manhattan residents, especially rescue- and-recovery workers, can suffer future adverse health effects. One such death related to health effects was the January 6, 2006 death of NYPD James Zadroga which was ruled by a New Jersey coroner as directly due to clean-up at the WTC site. This ruling was unequivocally rejected in October 2007 by the New York City Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch, and Medical Examiner Michele Slone. On June 29, 2019, former New York Police Department detective Luis G. Alvarez died from colorectal cancer, with which he was diagnosed in 2016 and is believed to be caused from his three months spent at Ground Zero after 9/11. There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30‚Äì40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.  Legal  Years after the attacks, legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA in the aftermath of the attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area. =Economic= After the terrorist attack various repercussions took place that affected the U.S as a whole. Due to all the money and claims that were being put out to help aid the victims of the attack, as well as different security and laws to protect the U.S, caused several layoffs and un- employments. Specifically, It was said that 462 extended masses were layoffs because of the attacks that displaced approximately 130,000 employees. The unemployment rate inclined to a total of 5.0% which is significant. The attacks caused an estimated overall economic loss to the city of $82.8-$94.8 billion USD, with the lower number being consistent with the NYC Partnership's November 2001 estimate and the high end being consistent with the New York City Comptroller's October 2001 estimate. It was calculated that the lost human productive value, life insurance payouts were $2.63 billion, federal payments after offsets were estimated at $2.34 billion and charitable payments were $0.79 billion.  Lost artwork  It was projected by one individual that the public art that was damaged or destroyed during the attacks was valued at $10 million. Art by Louise Nevelson, Alexander Calder, and James Rosati were all destroyed along with a memorial sculpture by Elyn Zimmerman in memorial for the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing.  Insurance claims  As of August 2002, there were approximately 1,464 claims against the city of New York City that amounted to approximately $8.2 billion. Although the New York City's Law Department indicated at the time that the City's liability for the claims would only be around $350 million, provided through an act of Congress. The claims ranged from City employees personal injuries that totaled around $5.2 billion, suffering due to the loss of life that totaled around $3 billion and for destruction of property such as the one filed by AEGIS Insurance Company for $250 million. Grants and funds Following the road to recovery the federal government and state begin issuing grants and various funds to compensate and help those who suffered. The 9/11 Heroes Stamp Program was administered by the Department of Homeland Security which gave funds to those who became disabled from direct contact in the attack or suffered a loss from the attack. The Post- 9/11 GI Bill became a result after 9/11, paying homage to the U.S military soldiers, which provided educational and financial assistance to those soldiers who were returning to civilian life. Federal grant aid assisted states, communities, and local organizations in their efforts to stay safe and remain readily prepared. In order for that to happen the program law enforcement training and technical assistance grant was created hoping to stop or better compose for a terrorist attack. The September 11th Victim Compensation fund (VCF) was established to provide financial assistance to those that experienced the disaster directly or those who lost family members from the attack. The fund has provided reimbursements for medical treatments for various conditions affecting victims, including PTSD and health effects from being exposed to toxic air.  Trade relations  The attacks affected trade relations with foreign countries, complicating the supply of oil demands. After the attack, oil prices skyrocketed. = New infrastructure = Rebuilding of the area began shortly after clean up, and construction began on the Freedom Tower and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.  Park51  Park51 (originally named Cordoba House) is a planned 13-story Muslim community center to be located two blocks from the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. The majority of the center will be open to the general public and its proponents have said the center will promote interfaith dialogue. It will contain a Muslim prayer space that has controversiallyOlbermann: There is no ‚ÄòGround Zero Mosque‚Äô NBC News's Keith Olbermann questions Americ√§'s religious toleranceThe Ground Zero \\"mosque\\" is not a mosque Huffington Post article been referred to as the \\"Ground Zero mosque\\", though numerous commentators noted that it was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It would replace an existing 1850s Italianate-style building that was being used as a Burlington Coat Factory before it was damaged in the September 11 attacks. The proposed multi- faith aspects of the design include a 500-seat auditorium, theater, a performing arts center, a fitness center, a swimming pool, a basketball court, a childcare area, a bookstore, a culinary school, an art studio, a food court, and a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The prayer space for the Muslim community will accommodate 1,000‚Äì2,000 people.  Security and military actions  The evolution of security and protective services changed tremendously due to the attacks. Immediate changes included air travel policies, airport security and screening, and guidelines that must be obeyed before getting on board. Congress immediately responded after the terrorist attack by passing the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which applied to different types of transportation, not just air travel. Additional screening was another main focus that took place during the period after the attacks, and many passengers were prescreened and advanced screened at different security checkpoints. This led to the major issue of racial profiling and invasion of privacy, as many Middle Eastern-looking people were singled out for further screening. Luggage screening was another main objective, as new technology was introduced to scan passengers' luggage thoroughly and search for weapons or bombs. In addition, some pilots were required by the Department of Homeland Security to carry a firearm on board. Better known as a Federal flight deck officer, these pilots undergo training to prevent terrorist attacks or other potential dangers on an airplane. Another act was passed known as the USA Patriot Act, which broadened the powers of law enforcement for the purpose of identifying terrorist activity. For example, law enforcement were allowed able to break and enter one's premises without a search warrant and without their consent, if they were suspected of terrorist activity. This also included roving wiretaps as a method of surveillance. For instance, the government was allowed to search through one's record searches, and intelligence searches. Specifically, if one searched terrorism activities or showed unusual behavior and then deleted their history, the government was able to see that. The purpose of this act was to catch acts of terrorism before any attacks were planned and executed. A program called Total Information Awareness was developed to enhance technology that would collect and analyze information about every individual in the United States, and trace unusual behaviors that could help prevent terrorist activities. Information that was gathered through the program included internet activity, credit card purchase histories, airline ticket purchases, and medical records. =9/11-related plots and attacks within the US= Coffins of soldiers killed in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting being loaded aboard an aircraft for flight to Dover Air Force Base Thwarted attacks * A similar al-Qaeda plan to crash airplanes into the US Bank Tower (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles and in other buildings elsewhere in the US as part of a 'Second Wave' of aircraft hijackings by martyr (suicide) squads to be in the spring or summer of 2002 *2001 shoe bomb plot in which a passenger carried shoes that were packed with two types of explosives * 2003 plot by Iyman Faris to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City *2004 Financial buildings plot which targeted the International Monetary Fund and World Bank buildings in Washington, DC, the New York Stock Exchange and other financial institutions * 2004 Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot *2006 transatlantic aircraft plot which was to involve liquid explosives *2006 Sears Tower plot *2007 Fort Dix attack plot *2007 John F.

International Part of the North Tower's antenna mast displayed at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., behind it a panel of September 12 front pages from around the world The attacks had major worldwide political effects. Many other countries introduced tough anti-terrorism legislation and took action to cut off terrorist finances, including the freezing of bank accounts suspected of being used to fund terrorism. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies stepped up cooperation to arrest terrorist suspects and break up suspected terrorist cells around the world. Reaction to the attacks in the Muslim world was mixed. Also, shortly after the attack, the media picked up on a number of celebrations of the attacks in the Middle East with images of these celebrations being broadcast on television and published in print. Less publicized were public displays of sympathy, including candlelight vigils in countries like Iran.Scholars of Islam & the Tragedy of Sept. 11 In the immediate aftermath, support for the United States' right to defend itself was expressed across the world, and by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368.UN Security Council Resolution 1368 (2001) The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, was in Washington D.C. at the time of the attacks and invoked the ANZUS military alliance as a pledge of Australian assistance to the U.S. = Aid = In the immediate aftermath of the attacks many United States based airports would not accept air plane flights to land, causing Operation Yellow Ribbon in which all incoming international flights were reroute by the FAA to airports in Canada. Many Canadians opened up their homes to stranded travelers and organizations such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals gave comfort to animals and other special groups that were stranded by the diversions. In France, calls to the United States Embassy were placed by locals who offered rooms within their homes to stranded passengers and observed the official day of mourning with three minutes of silence and stillness. = Memorials and vigils = The attack prompted numerous memorials and services all over the world with many countries, along with the United States, declaring a national day of mourning. In Berlin, 200,000 Germans marched to show their solidarity with America. The French newspaper of record, Le Monde, ran a front-page headline reading \\"Nous sommes tous Am√©ricains\\", or \\"We are all Americans\\". In London, the US national anthem was played at the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. (To mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee, New York City lit the Empire State Building in purple and gold, to say \\"thank you\\" for this action.) =Hate crimes= Hate crimes against Muslims increased around the world. For example, Canada experienced a 16-fold increase in anti-Muslim attacks immediately a year after 9/11. In the year leading to the attack, there were only 11 reported crimes but a year following 9/11, there were 173 hate crime cases reported. The same also happened in the United Kingdom and Australia. In the latter's case, a study conducted in Sydney and Melbourne revealed an overwhelming majority of Muslim residents who experienced racism or racist violence since the attack. Another study claimed that hate crimes \\"increased for all Muslims after 9/11, although the relative risk was much higher for those individuals living in countries with smaller Muslim populations.\\" An increase in racial tensions was seen in countries such as England, with a number of violent crimes linked to the September 11th attacks. The most severe example was seen in Peterborough, where teenager Ross Parker was murdered by a gang of up to ten Muslims of Pakistani background who had sought a white male to attack.

That emphasis is typically caused by such properties as increased loudness and vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and changes in tone. The terms stress and accent are often used synonymously in that context but are sometimes distinguished. For example, when emphasis is produced through pitch alone, it is called pitch accent, and when produced through length alone, it is called quantitative accent. When caused by a combination of various intensified properties, it is called stress accent or dynamic accent; English uses what is called variable stress accent. Since stress can be realised through a wide range of phonetic properties, such as loudness, vowel length, and pitch (which are also used for other linguistic functions), it is difficult to define stress solely phonetically. The stress placed on syllables within words is called word stress or lexical stress. Some languages have fixed stress, meaning that the stress on virtually any multisyllable word falls on a particular syllable, such as the penultimate (e.g. Polish) or the first (e.g. Finnish). Other languages, like English and Russian, have variable stress, where the position of stress in a word is not predictable in that way. Sometimes more than one level of stress, such as primary stress and secondary stress, may be identified. However, some languages, such as French and Mandarin, are sometimes analyzed as lacking lexical stress entirely. The stress placed on words within sentences is called sentence stress or prosodic stress. That is one of the three components of prosody, along with rhythm and intonation. It includes phrasal stress (the default emphasis of certain words within phrases or clauses), and contrastive stress (used to highlight an item, a word or part of a word, that is given particular focus).  Phonetic realization  There are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream, and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken. Stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables, and may have a higher or lower pitch. They may also sometimes be pronounced longer. There are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation ‚Äì in particular, vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central (or \\"neutral\\") articulation, while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation. Stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal. These particular distinguishing features of stress, or types of prominence in which particular features are dominant, are sometimes referred to as particular types of accent ‚Äì dynamic accent in the case of loudness, pitch accent in the case of pitch (although that term usually has more specialized meanings), quantitative accent in the case of length, and qualitative accent in the case of differences in articulation. These can be compared to the various types of accent in music theory. In some contexts, the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent (or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings). A prominent syllable or word is said to be accented or tonic; the latter term does not imply that it carries phonemic tone. Other syllables or words are said to be unaccented or atonic. Syllables are frequently said to be in pretonic or post-tonic position; certain phonological rules apply specifically to such positions. For instance, in American English, /t/ and /d/ are flapped in post-tonic position. In Mandarin Chinese, which is a tonal language, stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency, while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings. (See also Stress in Standard Chinese.) Stressed syllables are often perceived as being more forceful than non-stressed syllables.  Lexical stress  Lexical stress, or word stress, is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word. The position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question, but in other languages, it must be learned for each word, as it is largely unpredictable. In some cases, classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties; for example, loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language, or the special pattern for Turkish placenames. =Non- phonemic stress= In some languages, the placement of stress can be determined by rules. It is thus not a phonemic property of the word, because it can always be predicted by applying the rules. Languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress. For example, in Czech, Finnish, Icelandic and Hungarian, the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word. In Armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word. In Quechua, Esperanto, and Polish, the stress is almost always on the penult (second-last syllable). In Macedonian, it is on the antepenult (third-last syllable). Other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way, as in Classical Arabic and Latin, where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables. They are said to have a regular stress rule. Statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation, prosodic factors (see below) come into play, which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence. French words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable, but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable (unless it is a schwa, when stress is placed on the second-last syllable) of any string of words in that language. Thus, it is on the last syllable of a word analyzed in isolation. The situation is similar in Standard Chinese. French (some authors add Chinese) can be considered to have no real lexical stress. =Phonemic stress= Languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress. For example, English, Russian, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word. In some languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Lakota and, to some extent, Italian, stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks, for example in the Spanish words and . Sometimes, stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word, or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word. In such languages with phonemic stress, the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words. For example, the English words insight () and incite () are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter. Examples from other languages include German ( \\"to rewrite\\" vs. \\"to paraphrase\\"); and Italian ( \\"anchor\\" vs. \\"more, still, yet\\"). In many languages with lexical stress, it is connected with alternations in vowels and/or consonants, which means that vowel quality differs by whether vowels are stressed or unstressed. There may also be limitations on certain phonemes in the language in which stress determines whether they are allowed to occur in a particular syllable or not. That is the case with most examples in English and occurs systematically in Russian, such as (, \\"castle\\") vs. (, \\"lock\\"); and in Portuguese, such as the triplet (, \\"wise woman\\"), (, \\"knew\\"), (, \\"thrush\\"). Dialects of the same language may have different stress placement. For instance, the English word laboratory is stressed on the second syllable in British English (lab√≥ratory often pronounced \\"lab√≥ratry\\", the second o being silent), but the first syllable in American English, with a secondary stress on the \\"tor' syllable (l√°boratory often pronounced \\"l√°bratory\\"). The Spanish word is stressed on the first syllable in Spain () but on the second syllable in the Americas (). The Portuguese words for Madagascar and the continent Oceania are stressed on the third syllable in European Portuguese ( and ), but on the fourth syllable in Brazilian Portuguese ( and ). =Compounds= With very few exceptions, English compound words are stressed on their first component. And even such exceptions, for example mank√≠nd,mankind in the Collins English Dictionary are instead often stressed on the first component by some people or in some kinds of English.mankind in the American Heritage Dictionary Sometimes the same components as those of a compound word are used in a descriptive phrase with a different meaning and with stress on both words, but that descriptive phrase is then not usually considered a compound: bl√°ck b√≠rd (any bird that is black) and bl√°ckbird (a specific bird species) and p√°per b√°g (a bag made of paper) and p√°per bag (very rarely used to mean a bag for carrying newspapers but is often also used to mean a bag made of paper).\\"paper bag\\" in the Collins English Dictionary = Levels of stress = Some languages are described as having both primary stress and secondary stress. A syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress. As with primary stress, the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language. In English, it is not fully predictable, but the different secondary stress of the words organization and accumulation (on the first and second syllable, respectively) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs √≥rganize and acc√∫mulate. In some analyses, for example the one found in Chomsky and Halle's The Sound Pattern of English, English has been described as having four levels of stress: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, but the treatments often disagree with one another. Peter Ladefoged and other phoneticians have noted that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as unstressed syllables are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction.Ladefoged (1975 etc.) A course in phonetics ¬ß 5.4; (1980) Preliminaries to linguistic phonetics p 83 They believe that the multiple levels posited for English, whether primary‚Äìsecondary or primary‚Äìsecondary‚Äìtertiary, are mere phonetic detail and not true phonemic stress, and often, the alleged secondary stress is not characterized by the increase in respiratory activity normally associated with primary stress in English or with all stress in other languages. (For further detail see Stress and vowel reduction in English.)  Prosodic stress  Prosodic stress, or sentence stress, refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word ‚Äì namely within a prosodic unit. It may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language, but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance (contrastive stress). An example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for French above; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words (or if that is a schwa, the next-to-final syllable). A similar pattern has been claimed for English (see above): the traditional distinction between (lexical) primary and secondary stress is replaced partly by a prosodic rule stating that the final stressed syllable in a phrase is given additional stress. (A word spoken alone becomes such a phrase, hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases.) Another type of prosodic stress pattern is quantity sensitivity ‚Äì in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer (moraically heavy). Prosodic stress is also often used pragmatically to emphasize (focus attention on) particular words or the ideas associated with them. Doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence; for example: As in the examples above, stress is normally transcribed as italics in printed text or underlining in handwriting. In English, stress is most dramatically realized on focused or accented words. For instance, consider the dialogue In it, the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of \\"tomorrow\\" would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of \\"dinner\\", the emphasized word. In these emphasized words, stressed syllables such as \\"din\\" in \\"dinner\\" are louder and longer.R. Silipo and S. Greenberg, Automatic Transcription of Prosodic Stress for Spontaneous English Discourse, Proceedings of the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS99), San Francisco, CA, August 1999, pages 2351‚Äì2354 They may also have a different fundamental frequency, or other properties. The main stress within a sentence, often found on the last stressed word, is called the nuclear stress.  Stress and vowel reduction  In many languages, such as Russian and English, vowel reduction may occur when a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position. In English, unstressed vowels may reduce to schwa-like vowels, though the details vary with dialect (see Stress and vowel reduction in English). The effect may be dependent on lexical stress (for example, the unstressed first syllable of the word photographer contains a schwa , whereas the stressed first syllable of photograph does not ), or on prosodic stress (for example, the word of is pronounced with a schwa when it is unstressed within a sentence, but not when it is stressed). Many other languages, such as Finnish and the mainstream dialects of Spanish, do not have unstressed vowel reduction; in these languages vowels in unstressed syllables have nearly the same quality as those in stressed syllables.  Stress and rhythm  Some languages, such as English, are said to be stress-timed languages; that is, stressed syllables appear at a roughly constant rate and non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate that, which contrasts with languages that have syllable timing (e.g. Spanish) or mora timing (e.g. Japanese), whose syllables or moras are spoken at a roughly constant rate regardless of stress. For details, see Isochrony.  Historical effects  It is common for stressed and unstressed syllables to behave differently as a language evolves. For example, in the Romance languages, the original Latin short vowels and have often become diphthongs when stressed. Since stress takes part in verb conjugation, that has produced verbs with vowel alternation in the Romance languages. For example, the Spanish verb has the form in the past tense but in the present tense (see Spanish irregular verbs). Italian shows the same phenomenon but with alternating with instead. That behavior is not confined to verbs; note for example Spanish \\"wind\\" from Latin , or Italian \\"fire\\" from Latin .  Stress \\"deafness\\"  An operational definition of word stress may be provided by the stress \\"deafness\\" paradigm. The idea is that if listeners perform poorly on reproducing the presentation order of series of stimuli that minimally differ in the position of phonetic prominence (e.g. [n√∫mi]/[num√≠]), the language doesn't have word stress. The task involves a reproduction of the order of stimuli as a sequence of key strokes, whereby key \\"1\\" is associated with one stress location (e.g. [n√∫mi]) and key \\"2\\" with the other (e.g. [num√≠]). A trial may be from 2 to 6 stimuli in length. Thus, the order [n√∫mi- n√∫mi-num√≠-n√∫mi] is to be reproduced as \\"1121\\". It was found that listeners whose native language was French performed significantly worse than Spanish listeners in reproducing the stress patterns by key strokes. The explanation is that Spanish has lexically contrastive stress, as evidenced by the minimal pairs like (\\"mole\\") and (\\"[he/she/it] met\\"), while in French, stress does not convey lexical information and there is no equivalent of stress minimal pairs as in Spanish. An important case of stress \\"deafness\\" relates to Persian. The language has generally been described as having contrastive word stress or accent as evidenced by numerous stem and stem-clitic minimal pairs such as /m…íhi/ [m…í.h√≠] (\\"fish\\") and /m…íh-i/ [m…íÃÅ.hi] (\\"some month\\"). The authors argue that the reason that Persian listeners are stress \\"deaf\\" is that their accent locations arise postlexically. Persian thus lacks stress in the strict sense.  Spelling and notation for stress  The orthographies of some languages include devices for indicating the position of lexical stress. Some examples are listed below: * In Modern Greek, all polysyllables are written with an acute accent () over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (The acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs, as in (\\"the\\") and (\\"or\\"); here the stress of the two words is the same.) * In Spanish orthography, stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel. Stressed antepenultimate syllables are always written with that accent mark, as in . If the last syllable is stressed, the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters n, s, or a vowel, as in . If the penultimate syllable is stressed, the accent is used if the word ends in any other letter, as in . That is, if a word is written without an accent mark, the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel, n, or s, but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter. However, as in Greek, the acute accent is also used for some words to distinguish various syntactical uses (e.g. \\"tea\\" vs. a form of the pronoun ; \\"where\\" as a pronoun or wh- complement, \\"where\\" as an adverb). For more information, see Stress in Spanish. * In Portuguese, stress is sometimes indicated explicitly with an acute accent (for i, u, and open a, e, o), or circumflex (for close a, e, o). The orthography has an extensive set of rules that describe the placement of diacritics, based on the position of the stressed syllable and the surrounding letters. * In Italian, the grave accent is needed in words ending with an accented vowel, e.g. , \\"city\\", and in some monosyllabic words that might otherwise be confused with other words, like (\\"there\\") and (\\"the\\"). It is optional for it to be written on any vowel if there is a possibility of misunderstanding, such as (\\"condominiums\\") and (\\"joint owners\\"). See . Though not part of normal orthography, a number of devices exist that are used by linguists and others to indicate the position of stress (and syllabification in some cases) when it is desirable to do so. Some of these are listed here. * Most commonly, the stress mark is placed before the beginning of the stressed syllable, where a syllable is definable. However, it is occasionally placed immediately before the vowel. In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), primary stress is indicated by a high vertical line (primary stress mark: \`\`) before the stressed element, secondary stress by a low vertical line (secondary stress mark: \`\`). For example, or . Extra stress can be indicated by doubling the symbol: . * Linguists frequently mark primary stress with an acute accent over the vowel, and secondary stress by a grave accent. Example: or . That has the advantage of not requiring a decision about syllable boundaries. * In English dictionaries that show pronunciation by respelling, stress is typically marked with a prime mark placed after the stressed syllable: /si-lab‚Ä≤-…ô-fi-kay‚Ä≤-sh…ôn/. * In ad hoc pronunciation guides, stress is often indicated using a combination of bold text and capital letters. For example, si-lab-if-i-KAY-shun or si-LAB-if-i-KAY-shun * In Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian dictionaries, stress is indicated with an acute accent (¬¥) on a syllable's vowel (example: ).Some pre-revolutionary dictionaries, e.g. Dal's Explanatory Dictionary, marked stress with an apostrophe just after the vowel (example: ); see Secondary stress may be unmarked or marked with a grave accent: . If the acute accent sign is unavailable for technical reasons, stress can be marked by making the vowel capitalized or italic. In general texts, stress marks are rare, typically used either when required for disambiguation of homographs (compare ‚Äì \\"in great quantities\\", and ‚Äì \\"in great _er_ quantities\\"), or in rare words and names that are likely to be mispronounced. Materials for foreign learners may have stress marks throughout the text. * In Dutch, ad hoc indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel (or, in the case of a diphthong or double vowel, the first two vowels) of the stressed syllable. Compare (deterioration) and (back exit). * In Biblical Hebrew, a complex system of cantillation marks is used to mark stress, as well as verse syntax and the melody according to which the verse is chanted in ceremonial Bible reading. In Modern Hebrew, there is no standardized way to mark the stress. Most often, the cantillation mark oleh (part of oleh ve-yored), which looks like a left-pointing arrow above the consonant of the stressed syllable, for example b√≥ker (morning) as opposed to bok√©r (cowboy). That mark is usually used in books by the Academy of the Hebrew Language and is available on the standard Hebrew keyboard at AltGr-6. In some books, other marks, such as meteg, are used.

However, by the 1960s, many traditional shepherds had lost their land to cattle ranchers and the U.S. Forest Service. The Tierra Amarilla incident On June 5, 1967, in Tierra Amarilla, a small band of Hispanos affiliated with Alianza Federal de Mercedes attempted to arrest the County's district attorney and put him on trial.Sabine R.

He was the last Danish monarch of the older Royal branch of the House of Oldenburg and also the last king of Denmark to rule as an absolute monarch. During his reign, he signed a constitution that established a Danish parliament and made the country a constitutional monarchy. Frederick's motto was Folkets K√¶rlighed, min Styrke (Danish for the People's Love, my Strength). Family Frederick was born at Amalienborg Palace to Christian VIII of Denmark and Duchess Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His maternal grandparents were Friedrich Franz I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Luise, Duchess of Saxe-Gotha. Marriages The king's first two marriages both ended in scandal and divorce. He was first married in Copenhagen on 1 November 1828 to his second cousin Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark, a daughter of King Frederick VI of Denmark. They separated in 1834 and divorced in 1837. On 10 June 1841 he married for a second time to Duchess Caroline Charlotte Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he divorced in 1846. On 7 August 1850 in Frederiksborg Palace, he morganatically married Louise Christina Rasmussen, whom he created Landgravine Danner in 1850 (), a milliner and former ballet dancer who had for many years been his acquaintance or mistress, the natural daughter of Gotthilf L. K√∏ppen and of Juliane Caroline Rasmussen. This marriage seems to have been happy, although it aroused great moral indignation among the nobility and the bourgeoisie. Countess Danner, who was denounced as a vulgar gold digger by her enemies, but viewed as an unaffected daughter of the people by her admirers, seems to have had a stabilizing effect on him. She also worked at maintaining his popularity by letting him meet the people of the provinces. =Extramarital relations and possible offspring= The expectation that Frederick would not likely produce offspring, despite numerous affairs, was widespread, but sources rarely state the reasons. Some speculate that Frederick was infertile. During the reign of Frederick's father, Christian VIII, the succession question was already being brought forward. (See below: Succession crisis) It has recently been claimed that the king did indeed father a son, Frederik Carl Christian Poulsen, born on 21 November 1843, as a result of his relationship with Else Maria Guldborg Pedersen (also referred to as Marie Poulsen), which took place after his first two unhappy marriages. This was brought forward in a book published in 1994 and again in a book published in 2009. According to an article in the Danish newspaper Politiken, the author of the latter book, who believes herself to be the great- granddaughter of Frederick VII, is in possession of four letters from the King to Marie Poulsen in which he acknowledged paternity. The letters are quoted in the book.Margrethe could be your Queen, Politiken, 2 October 2009 (in Danish)Gete Bondo Oldenborg Maal√∏e: Getes Erindringer, √Ödalen, 2009, In all cases, however, extramarital offspring were and still are barred from the line of succession. It has been claimed Frederick had a same-sex relationship with his friend, Carl Berling (1812‚Äì1871), publisher and owner of the newspaper Berlingske Tidende. The bisexual Berling had an illegitimate child with Louise Rasmussen, Carl Christian (1841‚Äì1908) who was much liked by the King, to the extent that he insisted on signing the new constitution on Carl Christian's 8th birthday on 5 June 1849. To retain a tinge of decency, the King married Louise Rasmussen and the trio then moved into the royal castle where Berling was appointed Chamberlain and remained until 1861. The public indignation within higher circles over Frederick's morganatic marriage is well-known, but reasons have rarely been explained in detail.DIS-Forum :: AneEfterlysning :: Louise Rasmussen (Danner)P. Fr. Suhm: Hemmelige Efterretninger om de danske Konger efter souveraineteten, Copenhagen 1918 Reign Frederick, who was the last king of the older branch of the Oldenburg dynasty, had a rather neglected childhood after the divorce of his parents. His youth was marked by private scandals and for many years he appeared as the problem child of the royal family. When he succeeded to the throne in January 1848, he was almost at once met by the demands for a constitution. The Schleswig-Holsteiners wanted an independent state while the Danes wished to maintain South Jutland as a Danish area. The king soon yielded to the Danish demands, and in March he accepted the end of absolutism, which resulted in the June Constitution of 1849. During the First War of Schleswig against the German powers in 1848‚Äì51, Frederick appeared as ‚Äùthe national leader‚Äù and was regarded almost as a war hero, despite having never taken any active part in the struggles. During his reign, Frederick on the whole behaved as a constitutional monarch. He did not, however, quite give up interfering in politics. In 1854, he contributed to the fall of the strongly conservative √òrsted cabinet, and in 1859‚Äì60, he accepted a liberal government appointed on the initiative of his wife. During the crisis in the Duchies in 1862‚Äì63, shortly before his death, he spoke openly for an inter-Scandinavian military co-operation. Those minor crises created frictions and maintained some permanent insecurity, but did not damage his general popularity. In some of these affairs, he overstepped the mark beyond any doubt; on the other hand, the first Danish constitution was somewhat vague as regards to the limits of royal power. Frederick's rule also witnessed the heyday of the National Liberal Party, which was in office from 1854. This period was marked by some political and economic reforms, such as the beginning of the demolition of the walls around Copenhagen and, in 1857, the introduction of free trade. The constant quarrels with the opposition regarding the Schleswig-Holstein Question and German demands that Denmark not try to unite with Schleswig (South Jutland) led to some changes to the constitution in order to fit the foreign political situation, which created frustration in Denmark. The National Liberals therefore at last favored a more resistant course against the Germans, which led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. The king wholeheartedly supported this course and just before his sudden death he was prepared to sign a new special constitution for Denmark and Schleswig (the so-called November Constitution). Succession crisis Frederick was married three times, but produced no legitimate issue. The fact that he reached middle age without producing an heir meant that Prince Christian of Gl√ºcksburg (1818‚Äì1906), the paternal descendant of Christian III, and an 8th cousin of his father Christian VIII was chosen as his heir- presumptive in 1852. When Frederick died in 1863, Christian took the throne as Christian IX. Nationalism in the German-speaking parts of Schleswig-Holstein meant that there was no consensus to keep the duchies united under the Danish crown, internationally or within the duchies themselves. The duchies were inherited according to Salic law among the descendants of a past heiress, Helvig of Schauenburg, whose heir according to primogeniture after King Frederick VII was Frederick, Duke of Augustenburg (who proclaimed himself Duke of Schleswig-Holstein after Frederick VII's death). This Frederick of Augustenburg had become the symbol of the nationalist German independence movement in Schleswig-Holstein since the time that his father, in exchange for compensation, had renounced his claims as first in line to inherit the twin Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein following the London Protocol of 8 May 1852, which concluded the First War of Schleswig. Because of his father's renunciation, Frederick was regarded as ineligible to succeed. Denmark was (up until 1953) also under Salic Law, but only among descendants of Frederick III (who was the first hereditary monarch of Denmark. Previously the kingdom had been, officially, elective). But Frederick VII was the last of Frederick III's male line, therefore, his nearest kinsmen in the male-line, the Schleswig- Holstein ducal lines of Augustenborg and Gl√ºcksburg (cadet branches of Denmark's earlier, non-hereditary kings), were not entitled to succeed to Denmark's throne, although they retained hereditary claims to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Upon Frederick VII's death, Denmark's throne could devolve to or through a female heir according to \\"semi-Salic\\" succession. There were, however, conflicting interpretations of that provision and of Denmark's claim to its applicability to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, held theretofore in personal union by the kings of Denmark. The question was solved by an election and a separate law to confirm Denmark's new successor. The closest female relatives of Frederick VII were the issue of his paternal aunt, Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark, who had married a cadet Hessian prince. However, they were not male-line descendants of Helwig of Schauenburg, and thus were not eligible to succeed in Holstein, and had disputed claims on Schleswig. The semi-Salic heiresses of Frederick VII were Princess Caroline of Denmark and Frederick VII's divorced wife Vilhelmine (both childless daughters of the late King Frederick VI). They were followed in the line of succession by Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark, sister of Frederick VI, who had married Frederick, Duke of Augustenburg, Salic heir to Schleswig and Holstein after Frederick VII, but whose wife's claim to Denmark would only come into effect after the deaths of Caroline and Vilhelmine, both still living in 1863. Some rights also belonged to the Gl√ºcksburg line, a more junior branch of the royal clan. They were also semi-Salic heirs of Frederick III through a daughter of Frederick V of Denmark, and they were more junior agnatic heirs eligible to succeed in Schleswig-Holstein. These dynasts were Christian of Gl√ºcksburg (1818‚Äì1906) and his two elder brothers, the younger of whom had sons and daughters. Prince Christian of Gl√ºcksburg (1818‚Äì1906) had been a foster grandson of the sonless royal couple Frederick VI and Queen Marie Sophie, and thus was well known at the royal court. Prince Christian was a great-nephew of Queen Marie Sophie and descended from a first cousin of Frederick VI. He was brought up as a Dane, having lived in Danish-speaking lands of the royal dynasty and never bore arms for German interests against Denmark, as had other princes of the House of Gl√ºcksburg and the House of Augustenburg. This made him a relatively attractive royal candidate from the Danish viewpoint since, as a descendant of Frederick III, he was eligible to succeed in Denmark, although not first-in-line. He was also, but separately, eligible to inherit the dual duchies, but was not first-in-line. Christian of Gl√ºcksburg also had married Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, second eldest daughter of the closest female relative of Frederick VII. Louise's mother and brothers, princes of Hesse in Germany, renounced their rights in favor of Louise and her husband. Prince Christian's wife thereby became the closest female heiress of Frederick VII. The thorny question of the application of semi-Salic provision in the succession of Denmark was at that point resolved by legislation, through which Prince Christian of Gl√ºcksburg was chosen in 1852 to succeed Frederick VII in Denmark. Frederick VII died in Gl√ºcksburg in 1863 following an attack of erysipelas and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral. Christian took the throne as Christian IX. In November 1863, Frederick of Augustenborg claimed the twin- duchies in succession to Frederick VII of Denmark, who also was the last king of Denmark who, by primogeniture, was also sovereign Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, but whose death extinguished the patriline of Denmark's hereditary Oldenburg kings. The resulting divergence of hereditary claims to the duchies eventually developed into the Second War of Schleswig. Legacy Frederick VII managed to make himself one of the most beloved Danish kings of recent times. This was probably due partially to his relinquishment of absolutism and partially to his personality. In spite of many weaknesses documented by his contemporaries ‚Äî drinking, eccentric behavior, etc. ‚Äî he also possessed something of a gift as an actor. He could be both folksy and genuinely hearty, able to appear as a ‚Äùsimple, yet dignified monarch‚Äù. During his many travels throughout Denmark, he cultivated contacts with ordinary subjects. He was also a keen antiquarian and according to the later Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob, it was \\"he, more than anyone else, [who] helped to arouse the wide interest in Danish antiquities\\".P.V. Glob (1969). The Bog People: Iron Age Man Preserved. London: Faber and Faber Limited. Page 68-69.

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002, because it is widely distributed and abundant. Although it has been hunted extensively both for sport and fur, populations have proven resilient though declining in some areas. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or \\"bobbed\\") tail, from which it derives its name. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It is an adaptable predator inhabiting wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction (\\"extirpation\\") by coyotes and domestic animals. Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months. Two subspecies are recognised, one east of the Great Plains, and the other west of the Great Plains. They were probably separated during interglacial periods in the Pleistocene by the aridification of the Great Plains. It first appeared during the Irvingtonian stage around . The elusive predator features in some Indigenous Peoples' (of North and Central America) stories and in the folklore of European colonizers. Taxonomy The Canada lynx has distinct tufts atop its ears and longer ‚Äúmutton chop‚Äù style fur on its lower face There had been debate over whether to classify this species as Lynx rufus or Felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of Lynx should be given their own genus, or be placed as a subgenus of Felis. The genus Lynx is now accepted, and the bobcat is listed as Lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources. Johnson et al. reported Lynx shared a clade with the puma, leopard cat (Prionailurus), and domestic cat (Felis) lineages, dated to 7.15 million years ago (mya); Lynx diverged first, approximately 3.24 million years ago. The bobcat is believed to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur. =Subspecies= 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics: * L. r. rufus (Schreber) ‚Äì eastern and midwestern United States * L. r. gigas (Bangs) ‚Äì northern New York to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick * L. r. floridanus (Rafinesque) ‚Äì southeastern United States and inland to the Mississippi Valley, up to southwestern Missouri and southern Illinois * L. r. superiorensis (Peterson & Downing) ‚Äì western Great Lakes area, including upper Michigan, Wisconsin, southern Ontario, and most of Minnesota * L. r. baileyi (Merriam) ‚Äì southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico * L. r. californicus (Mearns) ‚Äì California west of the Sierra Nevada * L. r. mohavensis (B.Anderson) ‚Äì Mojave Desert of California * L. r. escuinapae (J. A. Allen) ‚Äì central Mexico, with a northern extension along the west coast to southern Sonora * L. r. fasciatus (Rafinesque) ‚Äì Oregon, Washington west of the Cascade Range, northwestern California, and southwestern British Columbia * L. r. oaxacensis (Goodwin) ‚Äì Oaxaca * L. r. pallescens (Merriam) ‚Äì northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan * L. r. peninsularis (Thomas) ‚Äì Baja California * L. r. texensis (Mearns) ‚Äì western Louisiana, Texas, south-central Oklahoma, and south into Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Coahuila This subspecies division has been challenged, given a lack of clear geographic breaks in their ranges and the minor differences between these subspecies. The latest revision of cat taxonomy in 2017, by the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognises only two subspecies, based on phylogeographic and genetic studies, although the status of the Mexican bobcat (Lynx rufus esquinapae syn. Lynx rufus oaxacensis) remains under review: * Lynx rufus rufus ‚Äì east of the Great Plains, North America * Lynx rufus fasciatus ‚Äì west of the Great Plains, North America Physical characteristics The bobcat's short tail is not always visible The small tufts on a bobcat's ears are difficult to spot at even moderate distance The bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus Lynx, but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. Generally, an off-white color is seen on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots. A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida, USA and New Brunswick, Canada. They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern. The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with round, black pupils. The nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.Bobcat Swims Across Lake Lanier. Youtube (August 3, 2015) The adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail, averaging ; the tail, which appears ‚Äúbobbed‚Äù and gives the species its name, adds An adult stands about at the shoulders.

Union Leader The largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern Canada and northern New England of the subspecies L. r. gigas, while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies L. r. floridanus, particularly those in the southern Appalachians. The bobcat is muscular, and its hind legs are longer than its front legs, giving it a somewhat irregular gait. At birth, it weighs and is about in length. By its first birthday, it weighs about . The cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats.Nowell, K. and Jackson, P. (1996). Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. (PDF). IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. A morphological size comparison study in the eastern United States found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes. Behavior The bobcat is crepuscular, and is active mostly during twilight. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night, it moves from along its habitual route. This behavior may vary seasonally, as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder weather. =Social structure and home range= Cat spotted in South San Jose, California Bobcat activities are confined to well- defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area.Allen, Maximilian L., Cody F. Wallace, and Christopher C. Wilmers. \\"Patterns in bobcat (Lynx rufus) scent marking and communication behaviors.\\" Journal of ethology 33.1 (2015): 9-14. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat. The sizes of bobcats' home ranges vary significantly; a World Conservation Union (IUCN) summary of research suggests ranges from . One study in Kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area. Transient bobcats were found to have both larger (roughly ) and less well-defined home ranges. Kittens had the smallest range at about . Dispersal from the natal range is most pronounced with males. Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from in summer up to in winter. Another found that female bobcats, especially those which were reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies. Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation. Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas. In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures are divergent, from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey. The average is estimated at one bobcat per . A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio. One study noted a dense, unhunted population in California had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female. When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female. Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested the males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and this helped limit reproduction until various factors lowered the density. =Hunting and diet= Bobcats often prey on rabbits, hares, and rodents. The bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food, but eats heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it often preys on larger animals, which it can kill and return to feed on later. The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals weighing about . Its main prey varies by region: in the eastern United States, it is the eastern cottontail and New England cottontail, and in the north, it is the snowshoe hare. When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat. In the far south, the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source. Birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes, along with their fledglings and eggs.Smith, J. W. (1988). Status of Missouri's experimental Trumpeter Swan restoration program. In Proc. and Papers of the 10th Trumpeter Swan Society Conf., edited by D. Compton, 100‚Äì103. Maple Plain, MN: The Trumpeter Swan Society. The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that, unlike the more specialized Canada lynx, readily varies its prey selection. Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet. The bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents (including squirrels), birds, fish including small sharks,Bobcat Drags Shark Out of Florida Surf and insects, it hunts in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close. It then pounces, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as geese, rabbits, and hares, it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it feeds on larger animals, such as young ungulates, and other carnivores, such as fishers (primarily female), foxes, minks, martens, skunks, small dogs, and domesticated cats.Donadio, E., & Buskirk, S. W. (2006). Diet, morphology, and interspecific killing in Carnivora. The American Naturalist, 167(4), 524-536.Farias, V., Fuller, T. K., Wayne, R. K., & Sauvajot, R. M. (2005). Survival and cause-specific mortality of gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) in southern California. Journal of Zoology, 266(3), 249-254. Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane. Bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry. While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants, such as sheep and goats. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals. It has been known to kill deer, especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed. The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative. =Reproduction and life cycle= Bobcat kittens in June, about 2‚Äì4 months old The average bobcat lifespan is 7 years long and rarely exceeds 10 years. The oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old, and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32. Bobcats generally begin breeding by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives. The female raises the young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes, a second litter is born as late as September. The female generally gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother. They hunt by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring. Tracks Bobcat tracks in mud showing the hind-paw print (top) partially covering the fore-paw print (center) Bobcat tracks show four toes without claw marks, due to their retractable claws. The tracks can range in size from ; the average is about 1.8 inches. When walking or trotting, the tracks are spaced roughly apart. The bobcat can make great strides when running, often from . Like all cats, the bobcat 'directly registers', meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints. Bobcat tracks can be generally distinguished from feral or house cat tracks by their larger size: about 2.0 in2 (13 cm¬≤) versus 1.5 in2 (10 cm¬≤). Ecology Skull showing large curved incisors The adult bobcat has relatively few predators other than humans. However seldomly, it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predators or fall prey to them. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park as well as elsewhere.Palomares, F., & Caro, T. M. (1999). Interspecific killing among mammalian carnivores. The American Naturalist, 153(5), 492-508. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed. Like other Lynx species, bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears, in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may be rarely be attacked by them.Krofel, M., Kos, I., & Jerina, K. (2012). The noble cats and the big bad scavengers: effects of dominant scavengers on solitary predators. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 66(9), 1297-1304.IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Kristin Nowell, Peter Jackson. (1996). Wild Cats: Status survey and conservation action plan. Cambridge, UK: IUCN Publication Services Unit. Bobcat remains have occasionally been found in the resting sites of male fishers.Aubry, Keith and Rale, Catherine (July 2006) Ecological Characteristics of Fishers (Martes pennanti) in the Southern Oregon Cascade Range. USDA Forest Service‚ÄîPacific Northwest Research Station, Olympia Forestry Sciences Laboratory, Olympia, WA, U.S. American alligators (Alligator mississippensis) have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcats in the southeast United States. Bobcat defending a kill from a pair of coyotes Kittens may be taken by several predators, including owls (almost entirely great horned owls), eagles, foxes, and bears, as well as other adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reportedly observed preying on bobcats. Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population. The bobcat may have external parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, especially those of rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation. Distribution and habitat Bobcat in urban surroundings: The species' range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can still find a suitable habitat. The bobcat is an adaptable animal. It prefers woodlands‚Äîdeciduous, coniferous, or mixed‚Äîbut unlike the other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance. The bobcat's range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can find a suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species. The animal may appear in back yards in \\"urban edge\\" environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats. If chased by a dog, it usually climbs up a tree. The historical range of the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York, and a bobcat was captured in 2018 on a tourist boat in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state in the continuous 48 except Delaware. Its population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country. Conservation The bobcat population has seen a decline in the American Midwest, but is generally stable and healthy. It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not considered threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor. The species is considered endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It was removed from the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey at the turn of the 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. L. r. escuinipae, the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005. The bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open. Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas. In bobcats using urban habitats in California, the use of rodenticides has been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rats and mice, and to increased rates of severe mite infestation (known as notoedric mange), as an animal with a poison-weakened immune system is less capable of fighting off mange. Liver autopsies in California bobcats that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure. Alternative rodent control measures such as vegetation control and use of traps have been suggested to alleviate this issue. Importance in human culture Stories featuring the bobcat, in many variations, are found in some Indigenous cultures of North America, with parallels in South America. A story from the Nez Perce, for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. In a Shawnee tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, which gives rise to its spots. After trapping the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire, only to have the embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots. The Mohave believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other Tribes. European colonizers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it \\"rests prominently in the anthology of ... national folklore.\\" Grave artifacts from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village and not in the mounds themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.

Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case regarding abortion. In a plurality opinion, the Court upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion that was established in Roe v. Wade (1973), but altered the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the undue burden standard for abortion restrictions.. The case arose from a challenge to five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982; among the provisions were requirements for a waiting period, spousal notice, and (for minors) parental consent prior to undergoing an abortion procedure. In a plurality opinion jointly written by associate justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter, the Supreme Court upheld the \\"essential holding\\" of Roe, which was that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects a woman's right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability. The Court overturned the Roe trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis, thereby allowing states to implement abortion restrictions that apply during the first trimester of pregnancy. The Court also replaced the strict scrutiny standard of review required by Roe with the undue burden standard, under which abortion restrictions would be unconstitutional when they were enacted for \\"the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\" Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four provisions of the Pennsylvania law, but invalidated the requirement of spousal notification. Four justices wrote or joined opinions arguing that Roe v. Wade should have been struck down, while two justices wrote opinions favoring the preservation of the higher standard of review for abortion restrictions. Background In Casey, the plaintiffs challenged five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by Rep. Stephen F. Freind, arguing that the provisions were unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade. The Court in Roe was the first to establish abortion as a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority in Roe further held that women have a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The five provisions at issue in Casey are summarized below. * ¬ß 3205 Informed Consent. A woman seeking abortion had to give her informed consent prior to the procedure. The doctor had to provide her with specific information at least 24 hours before the procedure was to take place, including information about how the abortion could be detrimental to her health and about the availability of information about the fetus. * ¬ß 3209 Spousal Notice. A woman seeking abortion had to sign a statement stating that she had notified her husband prior to undergoing the procedure, unless certain exceptions applied. * ¬ß 3206 Parental Consent. Minors had to get the informed consent of at least one parent or guardian prior to the abortion procedure. Alternatively, minors could seek judicial bypass in lieu of consent. * ¬ß 3203 \\"Medical Emergency\\" definition. Defining a medical emergency as > [t]hat condition, which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical > judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to > necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or > for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible > impairment of a major bodily function. * ¬ß¬ß 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f) Reporting Requirements. Certain reporting and record keeping mandates were imposed on facilities providing abortion services. The case was a seminal one in the history of abortion decisions in the United States. It was the first case to provide an opportunity to overturn Roe since two liberal Justices, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, had been replaced with the Bush-appointed Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas. Both were viewed, compared with their predecessors, as ostensible conservatives. This left the Court with eight Republican-appointed justices‚Äîsix of whom had been appointed by Presidents Reagan or Bush, both of whom were well known for their opposition to Roe. Finally, the only remaining Democratic appointee‚ÄîJustice Byron White‚Äîhad been one of the two dissenters from the original Roe decision. At this point, only two of the Justices were obvious supporters of Roe v. Wade: Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe, and John Paul Stevens, who had joined opinions specifically reaffirming Roe in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The case was argued by ACLU attorney Kathryn Kolbert for Planned Parenthood, with Linda J. Wharton serving as Co-Lead Counsel. Pennsylvania attorney general Ernie Preate argued the case for the State. Upon reaching the Supreme Court, the United States joined the case as amicus curiae, and Solicitor General Ken Starr of the Bush Administration defended the Act in part by urging the Court to overturn Roe as having been wrongly decided. =The District Court's ruling= The plaintiffs were five abortion clinics, a class of physicians who provided abortion services, and one physician representing himself independently. They filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the state from enforcing the five provisions and have them declared facially unconstitutional. The District Court, after a three-day bench trial, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. =Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision= The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly burdensome because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress at the hands of their husbands.Constitutional Law and Politics: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Eighth Edition, Norton & Company, 2011 Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court's invalidation of that requirement. =The Supreme Court's consideration= At the conference of the Justices two days after oral argument, Justice David Souter defied expectations, joining Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, and Harry Blackmun, who had all dissented three years earlier in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services with regard to that plurality's suggested reconsideration and narrowing of Roe. This resulted in a precarious five-Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions. However, Justice Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter, and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter to write a plurality opinion that would reaffirm Roe. The Court's opinions Except for the three opening sections of the O'Connor‚ÄìKennedy‚ÄìSouter opinion, Casey was a divided judgment, as no other sections of any opinion were joined by a majority of justices. However, the plurality opinion jointly written by Justices Souter, O'Connor and Kennedy is recognized as the lead opinion with precedential weight because each of its parts was concurred with by at least two other Justices, albeit different ones for each part. =The O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter plurality opinion= The authors of the plurality opinion began by noting the U.S. government's previous challenges to Roe v. Wade: > Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our > holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her > pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v. Wade (1973), that definition of > liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the > United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again > asks us to overrule Roe. Upholding the \\"essential holding\\" in Roe The plurality opinion stated that it was upholding what it called the \\"essential holding\\" of Roe. The essential holding consists of three parts: (1) Women have the right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State can restrict the abortion procedure post- viability, so long as the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health; and (3) the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.Casey, 505 U.S. at 846. The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion is grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court had said in Eisenstadt v. Baird: \\"[i]f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\" Stare decisis analysis Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was one of the three authors of the \\"undue burden\\" standard that she first advocated for in earlier abortion rulings The plurality's opinion included a thorough discussion on the doctrine of stare decisis (respect of precedent), and provided a clear explanation for why the doctrine had to be applied in Casey with regards to Roe. The authors of the plurality opinion emphasized that stare decisis had to apply in Casey because the Roe rule had not been proven intolerable; the rule had become subject \\"to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation\\"; the law had not developed in such a way around the rule that left the rule \\"no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine\\"; and the facts had not changed, nor viewed differently, to \\"rob the old rule of significant application or justification.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 854‚Äì60. The plurality acknowledged that it was important for the Court to stand by prior decisions, even those decisions some found unpopular, unless there was a change in the fundamental reasoning underpinning the previous decision. The authors of the plurality opinion, making a special note of the precedential value of Roe v. Wade, and specifically how women's lives were changed by that decision, stated, > The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings > unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered > disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of > age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of > women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of > principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central > holding a doctrinal remnant.Casey, 505 U.S. at 860. The authors of the plurality opinion also acknowledged the need for predictability and consistency in judicial decision making. For example, > Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case > in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy > reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a > dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the > dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution > calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national > division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\\"Casey, > 505 U.S. at 866‚Äì67. The plurality went on to analyze past judgments refusing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis, such as Brown v. Board of Education. There, the authors of the plurality opinion explained, society's rejection of the \\"Separate but Equal\\" concept was a legitimate reason for the Brown v. Board of Education court's rejection of the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine.Casey, 505 U.S. at 862‚Äì64. Emphasizing the lack of need to overrule the essential holding of Roe, and the Court's need to not be seen as overruling a prior decision merely because the individual members of the Court had changed, the authors of the plurality opinion stated, > Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our > understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened > precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the > prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to > come out differently from the Court of 1973.Casey, 505 U.S. at 864. The plurality further emphasized that the Court would lack legitimacy if it frequently changed its Constitutional decisions, stating, > The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to > accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded > truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures > having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is > obliged to make.Casey, 505 U.S. at 865‚Äì66. Since the O'Connor-Kennedy-Souter plurality overruled some portions of Roe v. Wade despite its emphasis on stare decisis, Chief Justice Rehnquist in dissent argued that this section was entirely obiter dicta. All these opening sections were joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens for the majority. The remainder of the decision did not command a majority, but at least two other Justices concurred in judgment on each of the remaining points. Viability of the fetus Although upholding the \\"essential holding\\" in Roe, and recognizing that women have some constitutional liberty to terminate their pregnancies, the O'Connor‚ÄìKennedy‚ÄìSouter plurality overturned the Roe trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis. The Roe trimester framework completely forbade states from regulating abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, permitted regulations designed to protect a woman's health in the second trimester, and permitted prohibitions on abortion during the third trimester (when the fetus becomes viable) under the justification of fetal protection, and so long as the life or health of the mother was not at risk.Casey, 505 U.S. at 872; . The plurality found that continuing advancements in medical technology had proven that a fetus could be considered viable at 23 or 24 weeks rather than at the 28 weeks previously understood by the Court in Roe. The plurality thus redrew the line of increasing state interest at viability because of increasing medical accuracy about when fetus viability takes place. Likewise, the authors of the plurality opinion felt that fetus viability was \\"more workable\\" than the trimester framework.Casey, 505 U.S. at 870. Under this new fetus viability framework, the plurality held that at the point of viability and subsequent to viability, the state could promote its interest in the \\"potentiality of human life\\" by regulating, or possibly proscribing, abortion \\"except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 879. Prior to fetus viability, the plurality held, the State can show concern for fetal development, but it cannot pose an undue burden on a woman's fundamental right to abortion.Casey, 505 U.S. at 873, 876-78. The plurality reasoned that the new pre- and post-viability line would still uphold the essential holding of Roe, which recognized both the woman's constitutionally protected liberty, and the State's \\"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 871 (\\"[t]o protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion.\\"). The undue burden standard In replacing the trimester framework with the viability framework, the plurality also replaced the strict scrutiny analysis under Roe, with the \\"undue burden\\" standard previously developed by O'Connor in her dissent in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health.. A legal restriction posing an undue burden is one that has \\"the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 877. An undue burden is found even where a statute purports to further the interest of potential life or another valid state interest, if it places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's fundamental right to choice. The Supreme Court in the 2016 case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt clarified exactly what the 'undue burden' test requires: \\"Casey requires courts to consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\\"Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , , Opinion of the Court, page 19-20. The Supreme Court further clarified in the 2020 June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer with respect to the undue burden standard: \\"[T]his standard requires courts independently to review the legislative findings upon which an abortion- related statute rests and to weigh the law‚Äôs ‚Äúasserted benefits against the burdens‚Äù it imposes on abortion access. 579 U.S., at _(slip op., at 21) (citing Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124, 165 (2007)).\\" In Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt the court described the undue burden standard in its overall context with these words: In applying the new undue burden standard, the plurality overruled City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416 (1983) and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986),. each of which applied \\"strict scrutiny\\" to abortion restrictions. [at Note 197] Applying this new standard to the challenged Pennsylvania Act, the plurality struck down the spousal notice requirement, finding that for many women, the statutory provision would impose a substantial obstacle in their path to receive an abortion.Casey, 505 U.S. at 893‚Äì94. The plurality recognized that the provision gave too much power to husbands over their wives (\\"a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's decision\\"), and could worsen situations of spousal and child abuse.See 897, 892‚Äì94 (noting that women may not inform their husbands because of \\"justifiable fears of physical abuse\\" or fear that notification will \\"provoke further instances of child abuse\\", and women may also fear reporting past abuse to the State because of the other consequences that can come from that). In finding the provision unconstitutional, the authors of the plurality opinion clarified that the focus of the undue burden test is on the group \\"for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 894. Otherwise stated, courts should not focus on what portion of the population is affected by the legislation, but rather on the population the law would restrict.Casey, 505 U.S. at 894 (\\"The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\\"). The plurality upheld the remaining contested regulations ‚Äì the State's informed consent and 24-hour waiting period, parental consent requirements, reporting requirements, and the \\"medical emergencies\\" definition ‚Äì holding that none constituted an undue burden.Casey, 505 U.S. at 880 (medical emergency), 887 (informed consent and 24-hour waiting period), 899 (parental consent), and 900 (finding that recordkeeping and reporting requirements are constitutional, except those related to spousal notice). Notably, when the authors of the plurality discuss the right to privacy in the joint opinion, it is all within the context of a quotation or paraphrase from Roe or other previous cases. The authors of the plurality opinion do not, however, explicitly or implicitly state that they do not believe in a right to privacy, or that they do not support the use of privacy in Roe to justify the fundamental right to abortion. Justice Blackmun would not agree with an implication asserting otherwise, stating \\"[t]he Court today reaffirms the long recognized rights of privacy and bodily integrity.\\" Key judgement  Chief Justice John Roberts's concurrence in the 2020 June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo case noted the key outcomes in Casey: \\"The several restrictions that did not impose a substantial obstacle were constitutional, while the restriction that did impose a substantial obstacle was unconstitutional.\\" Before an abortion regulation can be struck down as unconstitutional there must be a determination that this regulation imposes a substantial obstacle in light of the undue burden standard explained in the section above. In Casey \\"the justices imposed a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The new standard asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an \\"undue burden,\\" which is defined as a \\"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\\" The key judgement of Casey can be summed up as follows: \\"Under Casey, abortion regulations are valid so long as they do not pose a substantial obstacle and meet the threshold requirement of being ‚Äúreasonably related‚Äù to a ‚Äúlegitimate purpose.‚Äù Id., at 878; id., at 882 (joint opinion).\\" =The concurrence/dissents= Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, who both joined the plurality in part, also each filed opinions concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part. Chief Justice William Rehnquist filed an opinion concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was joined by Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, none of whom joined any part of the plurality. Justice Scalia also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was also joined by Rehnquist, White, and Thomas. Rehnquist and Scalia, joined by White and Thomas Chief Justice William Rehnquist was the senior justice of the four that dissented against the upholding of Roe. Rehnquist and Scalia each joined the plurality in upholding the parental consent, informed consent, and waiting period laws. However, they dissented from the plurality's decision to uphold Roe v. Wade and strike down the spousal notification law, contending that Roe was incorrectly decided. In his opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist questioned the fundamental right to an abortion, the \\"right to privacy\\", and the strict scrutiny application in Roe.Casey, 505 U.S. at 950‚Äì54 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). He also questioned the new \\"undue burden\\" analysis under the plurality opinion, instead deciding that the proper analysis for the regulation of abortions was rational-basis.Casey, 505 U.S. at 966 (\\"Accordingly, we think that the correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in Webster. A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\\"). In his opinion, Justice Scalia also argued for a rational-basis approach, finding that the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety was constitutional.Casey, 505 U.S. at 981 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). He argued that abortion was not a \\"protected\\" liberty, and as such, the abortion liberty could be intruded upon by the State.See Casey, 505 U.S. at 979‚Äì80 (finding that it is not unconstitutional to intrude upon the abortion liberty because the abortion liberty is not a protected liberty). To this end, Justice Scalia concluded this was so because an abortion right was not in the Constitution, and \\"longstanding traditions of American society\\" have allowed abortion to be legally proscribed.Casey, 505 U.S. at 980. Rehnquist and Scalia joined each other's concurrence/dissents. White and Thomas, who did not write their own opinions, joined in both. Stevens and Blackmun Justice Harry Blackmun, the original author of Roe, would have struck down all of the Pennsylvania abortion restrictions, continuing to apply strict scrutiny. Justices Blackmun and Stevens wrote opinions in which they approved of the plurality's preservation of Roe and rejection of the spousal notification law. They did not, however, agree with the plurality's decision to uphold the other three laws at issue. Justice Stevens concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Stevens joined the plurality's preservation of Roe and rejection of the spousal notification law, but under his interpretation of the undue burden standard (\\"[a] burden may be 'undue' either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate rational justification\\"), he would have found the information requirements in ¬ß¬ß 3205(a)(2)(i)‚Äì(iii) and ¬ß 3205(a)(1)(ii), and the 24-hour waiting period in ¬ß¬ß 3205(a)(1)‚Äì(2) unconstitutional.Casey, 505 U.S. at 912‚Äì914, 920‚Äì22 (Stevens, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Instead of applying an undue burden analysis, Justice Stevens would have preferred to apply the analyses in Akron and Thornburgh, two cases that had applied a strict scrutiny analysis, to reach the same conclusions.Casey, 505 U.S. at 917‚Äì18 (\\"In my opinion, the principles established in this long line of cases and the wisdom reflected in Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in Akron (and followed by the Court just six years ago in Thornburgh) should govern our decision today.\\"). Justice Stevens also placed great emphasis on the fact that women had a right to bodily integrity, and a constitutionally protected liberty interest to decide matters of the \\"highest privacy and the most personal nature.\\"Casey, 505 U.S. at 915. As such, Justice Stevens felt that a State should not be permitted to attempt to \\"persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion\\"; he felt this was too coercive and violated the woman's decisional autonomy.Casey, 505 U.S. at 916. Justice Blackmun concurred in part, concurred in the judgment in part, and dissented in part. He joined the plurality's preservation of Roe ‚Äì of which he wrote the majority ‚Äì and he, too, rejected the spousal notification law.Casey, 505 U.S. at 923‚Äì26 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). Justice Blackmun, however, argued for a woman's right to privacy and insisted, as he did in Roe, that all non-de-minimis abortion regulations were subject to strict scrutiny.Casey, 505 U.S. at 926‚Äì28. Using such an analysis, Justice Blackmun argued that the content-based counseling, the 24-hour waiting period, informed parental consent, and the reporting regulations were unconstitutional.See Casey, 505 U.S. at 926, 934. He also dissented from the plurality's undue burden test, and instead found his trimester framework \\"administrable\\" and \\"far less manipulable\\". Casey, 505 U.S. at 930. Blackmun even went further in his opinion than Stevens, sharply attacking and criticizing the anti-Roe bloc of the Court. See also * Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) * Griswold v.

Casey"},{"id":"171813","text":"Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects the liberty of married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction. The case involved a Connecticut \\"Comstock law\\" that prohibited any person from using \\"any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.\\" The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, and that \\"the clear effect of [the Connecticut law ...] is to deny disadvantaged citizens ... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control.\\" By a vote of 7‚Äì2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the \\"right to marital privacy\\", establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as a right to \\"protect[ion] from governmental intrusion.\\". Although the Bill of Rights does not explicitly mention \\"privacy\\", Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority that the right was to be found in the \\"penumbras\\" and \\"emanations\\" of other constitutional protections, such as the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment. Douglas wrote, \\"Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.\\" Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the Ninth Amendment in support of the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice Byron White and Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that privacy is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Background  Griswold v. Connecticut originated as a prosecution under the Connecticut Comstock Act of 1873. The law made it illegal to use \\"any drug, medicinal article, or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception...\\". Violators could be \\"... fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned.\\" By the 1950s, Massachusetts and Connecticut were the only two states that still had such statutes, although they were almost never enforced. In the late 19th and early 20th century, physicians in the United States largely avoided the publication of any material related to birth control, even when they often recommended or at least gave advice regarding it to their married patients. Then in 1914, Margaret Sanger openly challenged the public consensus against contraception. She influenced the Connecticut Birth Control League (CBCL) and helped to develop the eventual concept of the Planned Parenthood clinics. The first Planned Parenthood clinic in Connecticut opened in 1935 in Hartford. It provided services to women who had no access to a gynecologist, including information about artificial contraception and other methods to plan the growth of their families. Several clinics were opened in Connecticut over the following years, including the Waterbury clinic that led to the legal dispute. In 1939, this clinic was compelled to enforce the 1879 anti-contraception law. This caught the attention of the CBCL leaders, who remarked on the importance of birth control for cases in which the lives of the patients depended upon it. During the 1940s, several cases arose from the provision of contraception by the Waterbury clinic, leading to legal challenges to the constitutionality of the Comstock law, but these failed on technical grounds. In Tileston v. Ullman (1943), a doctor and mother challenged the law on the grounds that a ban on contraception could, in certain sexual situations, threaten the lives and well-being of patients. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue on behalf of his patients. Yale School of Medicine gynecologist C. Lee Buxton and his patients brought a second challenge to the law in Poe v. Ullman (1961). The Supreme Court again dismissed the appeal, on the grounds that the case was not ripe: the plaintiffs had not been charged or threatened with prosecution, so there was no actual controversy for the Court to resolve. The polemic around Poe led to the appeal in Griswold v. Connecticut, primarily based on the dissent of Justice John Marshall Harlan II in Poe, one of the most cited dissents in Supreme Court history. He argued, foremost, that the Supreme Court should have heard the case rather than dismissing it. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad interpretation of the due process clause. On the basis of this interpretation, Harlan concluded that the Connecticut statute violated the Constitution. After Poe was handed down on June 1961, the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut (PPLC) decided to challenge the law again. Estelle T. Griswold served on the PPLC as Executive Director from 1954 to 1965. Struggling through legal battles against birth control restrictions in Connecticut, Griswold and PPLC made an initial effort to financially support women who wanted contraceptives to bus to cities in New York and Rhode Island. PPLC Executive Director Estelle Griswold and Dr. Buxton (PPLC medical volunteer), opened a birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut, \\"thus directly challeng[ing] the state law.\\" The clinic opened on November 1, 1961, and that same day received its first ten patients and dozens of appointment requests from married women who wanted birth control advice and prescriptions. Griswold and Buxton were arrested, tried, found guilty, and fined $100 each. The conviction was upheld by the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court, and by the Connecticut Supreme Court.  Supreme Court decision  On June 7, 1965, the Supreme Court issued a 7‚Äì2 decision in favor of Griswold that struck down Connecticut's state law against contraceptives. =Opinion of the Court= Seven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice William O. Douglas. The Court found that the U.S. Constitution protects \\"marital privacy\\" as a fundamental constitutional right. But the Court struggled to identify a particular source in the Constitution for this right. It rejected the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as the source of the marital privacy right, because at the time the Court still formally rejected the doctrine of substantive due process due to its association with the 1905 decision Lochner v. New York. Instead, the Court wrote that the marital privacy right was implied by the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, such as those in the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. It referenced earlier cases where the Court had found personal liberties that were constitutionally protected despite not being specifically enumerated in the Constitution, such as the constitutional right to parental control over childrearing found in the early 20th century cases Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters. The Court viewed marital privacy right's implicit nature to be similar, and in a now well-known line Douglas used the metaphor of shined light and its shadows to describe it. Reasoning that the provisions of the Bill of Rights created \\"emanations\\" of protection that created \\"penumbras\\" within which rights could still be covered even if not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, Douglas wrote that the right to marital privacy fell within this protection. The Court concluded that Connecticut's Comstock Law violated this right to privacy, and therefore was unconstitutional. Douglas reasoned that the right to marital privacy was \\"older than the Bill of Rights\\", and ended the opinion with an impassioned appeal to the sanctity of marriage in the Anglo-American culture and common law tradition. =Concurrences= Justice Arthur Goldberg concurred with the Court and wrote a separate opinion to emphasize his view that the Ninth Amendmentwhich states that if the Constitution enumerates certain rights but does not enumerate others it does not mean that the other rights do not existwas sufficient authority on its own to support the Court's finding of a fundamental constitutional right to marital privacy. Justice John Marshall Harlan II also concurred with the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion arguing that the right to privacy should be protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Byron White concurred only in the judgment, and wrote an opinion describing how he thought Connecticut's law failed rational basis scrutiny, saying: \\"I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State's ban on illicit sexual relationships.\\"Griswold, 381 U.S. at 505 (White, J., concurring in the judgment), quoted in . =Dissents= Justices Hugo Black and Potter Stewart dissented from the Court's decision. Both justices' dissents argued that because the U.S. Constitution does not expressly mention privacy in any of its provisions, the Court had no basis to strike down Connecticut's Comstock Law. Black's dissent concluded: \\"I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional 'right of privacy' as an emanation from one or more constitutional provisions. I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision.\\"Griswold, 381 U.S. at 508 (Black, J., dissenting), quoted in .  Precedent for later cases  Later decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court extended the principles of Griswold beyond its particular facts. =Right to birth control for unmarried couples, 1972= Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) extended its holding to unmarried couples, whereas the \\"right of privacy\\" in Griswold was said to only apply to marital relationships. The argument in Eisenstadt was that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny unmarried couples the right to use contraception when married couples did have that right (under Griswold). Writing for the majority, Justice Brennan wrote that Massachusetts could not enforce the law against married couples because of Griswold v. Connecticut, so the law worked \\"irrational discrimination\\" if not extended to unmarried couples as well. =Right to abortion for any woman, 1973= The reasoning and language of both Griswold and Eisenstadt were cited in the concurring opinion by Associate Justice Potter Stewart in support of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). The decision in Roe struck down a Texas law that criminalized aiding a woman in getting an abortion. The Court ruled that this law was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Abortion became legalized for any woman for any reason, up through the first trimester, with possible restrictions for maternal health in the second trimester (the midpoint of which is the approximate time of fetal viability). In the third trimester of pregnancy, abortion is potentially illegal with exception for the mother's health, which the court defined broadly in Doe v. Bolton. =Right to contraception for juveniles at least 16 years of age, 1977= In Carey v. Population Services International (1977) the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional to prohibit anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute nonprescription contraceptives to persons 16 years of age or over, to prohibit the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives by any adult to minors under 16 years of age, and to prohibit anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives. The Court also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not allow a state to intrude on an individual's decisions on matters of procreation which is protected as privacy rights. =Right to homosexual relations, 2003= Lawrence v. Texas (2003) struck down a Texas sodomy law that prohibited certain forms of intimate sexual contact between members of the same sex. Without stating a standard of review in the majority opinion, the court overruled Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), declaring that the \\"Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\\" Justice O'Connor, who wrote a concurring opinion, framed it as an issue of rational basis review. Justice Kennedy's majority opinion, based on the liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stated that the Texas anti-sodomy statute touched \\"upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home,\\" and attempted to \\"control a personal relationship that ... is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished.\\" Thus, the Court held that adults are entitled to participate in private, consensual sexual conduct. While the opinion in Lawrence was framed in terms of the right to liberty, Kennedy described the \\"right to privacy\\" found in Griswold as the \\"most pertinent beginning point\\" in the evolution of the concepts embodied in Lawrence.. =Right to same-sex marriage, 2015= Griswold was also cited in a chain of cases that led the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage in another landmark case, Obergefell v. Hodges.

Connecticut"},{"id":"171816","text":"The Extended Phenotype is a 1982 book by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, in which the author introduced a biological concept of the same name. The main idea is that phenotype should not be limited to biological processes such as protein biosynthesis or tissue growth, but extended to include all effects that a gene has on its environment, inside or outside the body of the individual organism. Dawkins considers The Extended Phenotype to be a sequel to The Selfish Gene (1976) aimed at professional biologists,Richard Dawkins, An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist, Black Swan, 2013, page 291. and as his principal contribution to evolutionary theory. Summary = Genes synthesize only proteins = A cathedral termite mound - a small animal with a large extended phenotype Dawkins argues that the only thing that genes control directly is the synthesis of proteins. He points to the arbitrariness of restricting the idea of the phenotype to apply only to the phenotypic expression of an organism's genes in its own body. Dawkins develops this idea by pointing to the effect that a gene may have on an organism's environment through that organism's behaviour. = Genes may affect more than the organism's body = Dawkins suggests that there are three forms of extended phenotype. The first is the capacity of animals to modify their environment using architectural constructions. Dawkins cited as examples caddis houses and beaver dams. The second is manipulating other organisms. Dawkins points out that animal morphology, and ultimately animal behaviour, may be advantageous not to the animal itself but, for instance, to a parasite which afflicts it ‚Äì \\"parasite manipulation\\". This refers to the capacity, found in several groups of parasites, to modify the behaviour of the host to increase the parasite's own fitness. One famous example of this second type of extended phenotype is the suicidal drowning of crickets infected by hairworm, a behaviour that is essential to the parasite's reproductive cycle. Another example of such behaviour is seen in female mosquitoes carrying malaria parasites. The mosquitoes are significantly more attracted to human breath and odours than uninfected mosquitoes.https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23543-malaria- bug-may-give-mosquitoes-a-super-sense-of-smell.html A 2013 study shows that an immune challenge with heat-killed Escherichia coli can generate the same changes in the behaviour as is seen in infection by Plasmodium yoelii. It raises an unanswered question: to what extent is the alteration of host behaviour due to active manipulation selected for in malaria parasites? The third form of extended phenotype is action at a distance of the parasite on its host. A common example is the manipulation of host behaviour by cuckoo chicks, which elicit intensive feeding by the parasitized host birds. These behavioural modifications are not physically associated with the host but influence the expression of its behavioural phenotype.D. P. HUGHES, J. BRODEUR and F. THOMAS (2012) Host Manipulation by Parasites. Oxford. Dawkins summarizes these ideas in what he terms the Central Theorem of the Extended Phenotype: Nests are typical examples of extended phenotypes. =Gene-centred view of life= In conducting this argument, Dawkins aims to strengthen the case for a gene-centric view of life, to the point where it is recognized that the organism itself needs to be explained. This is the challenge which he takes up in the final chapter entitled \\"Rediscovering the Organism.\\" The concept of extended phenotype has been generalized in an organism-centered view of evolution with the concept of niche construction, in the case where natural selection pressures can be modified by the organisms during the evolutionary process.  Reception  According to The University Observer, Dawkin‚Äôs concept of the extended phenotype can be applied to human institutions like financial and legal systems: \\"Our genes have built brains which have built financial systems which, at least in principle, maximise wealth. Where they fail at this (and they do, with some degree of regularity, it must be admitted), this can be attributed to the complex nature of the systems themselves.\\" French Canadian neurologist, Jean-Fran√ßois Gari√©py, develops Dawkin‚Äôs concept of power struggles between phenotypes that violate the interests of its genes into the theory of a \\"revolutionary phenotype\\". Building on the RNA-World-Hypothesis, Gari√©py makes the case that computer- based gene editing might lead to the emergence of a radically different human life form. Here, the replicator would no longer be recombination and mutation in human reproduction, but decisions taken by scientists or by a supercomputer if humanity were to outsource its own genetic modification to algorithmic decision making based on big data. Limitations Subsequent proponents expand this theory and posit that many organisms within an ecosystem can alter the selective pressures on all of them by modifying their environment in various ways. Dawkins himself asserted, ‚ÄúExtended phenotypes are worthy of the name only if they are candidate adaptations for the benefit of alleles responsible for variations in them‚Äù. For example, in humans, an architect's specific alleles are neither more nor less likely to be selected based on the design of his or her latest building.

The company sells skid steer loaders, compact excavators, compact utility vehicles, compact tractors, and other small hydraulic equipment under the Bobcat brand name. It is one of the few major manufacturing companies operating in North Dakota.Hermann Simon mentioned this company in his correspondent Book as an example of a \\"Hidden Champion\\" (Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions of the 21st Century : Success Strategies of unknown World Market Leaders. London: Springer, 2009.- .)  History  In the 1950s, Louis and Cyrus Keller operated Keller Welding and Repair near Rothsay, Minnesota. In 1956, Eddie Velo, a turkey farmer in the area, described to the Kellers a need for a machine small enough to maneuver inside a pole barn and light enough to operate on its upper level. The brothers developed a small, three-wheeled design with a belt-driven transmission, and delivered it to Velo on February 4, 1957. Velo allowed the Kellers full access to his operations, and after the Kellers learned of drawbacks with the belt-driven transmission, they developed and patented a more robust clutch-based transmission system in 1958. The new transmission became the basis of the Melroe M60 loader. The Kellers' uncle, an equipment dealer for the Melroe Manufacturing Company based in Gwinner, ND, suggested that Melroe market the machines, resulting in Melroe inviting the Kellers to exhibit at the 1958 Minnesota State Fair. Melroe introduced the four-wheeled M400 model \\"Skid-Steer Loader\\" in 1960, and began using \\"Bobcat\\" as a trade name for such products in 1962 on the 440-model loader. Les Melroe and advertising agent Lynn Bickett settled on the \\"Bobcat\\" name while exchanging name ideas during a drive between Minneapolis and Gwinner. Bickett and Sylvan Melroe developed the \\"tough, quick, and agile\\" slogan used in advertising the early loaders. Melroe was purchased by Clark Equipment Company in 1969 and then by Ingersoll-Rand in 1995. In 2007, Ingersoll Rand sold Clark Equipment Company to the Doosan Group of Korea, along with the rest of its construction equipment group. The Clark Equipment Company now does business as Bobcat Company.

Skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheeled or tracked vehicles with the wheels mechanically locked in synchronization on each side, and where the left-side drive wheels can be driven independently of the right-side drive wheels. The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment on the body of the machine. Turning is accomplished by differential steering, in which the left and right wheel pairs are operated at different speeds, and the machine turns by skidding or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. As with tracked vehicles, the high ground friction produced by skid steers can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces. They can be converted to low ground friction by using specially designed wheels such as the Mecanum wheel. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius, \\"pirouette\\" turning, which makes them extremely maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, agile loader. Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks instead of the wheels, and such a vehicle is known as a compact track loader. loaderhttps://www.bobcat.com/loaders/compact-track-loaders/features. Unlike in a conventional front loader, the lift arms in these machines are alongside the driver with the pivot points behind the driver's shoulders. Because of the operator's proximity to moving booms, early skid loaders were not as safe as conventional front loaders, particularly due to the lack of a ROPS. Modern skid loaders have cabs, open or fully enclosed and other features to protect the operator. Like other front loaders, they can push material from one location to another, carry material in the bucket, load material into a truck or trailer and perform a variety of digging and grading operations. History The first three-wheeled, front-end loader was invented by brothers Cyril and Louis Keller in Rothsay, Minnesota, in 1957. The Kellers built the loader to help a farmer, Eddie Velo, mechanize the process of cleaning turkey manure from his barn. The light and compact machine, with its rear caster wheel, was able to turn around within its own length, while performing the same tasks as a conventional front-end loader. The Melroe brothers, of Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, purchased the rights to the Keller loader in 1958 and hired the Kellers to continue refining their invention. As a result of this partnership, the M-200 Melroe self-propelled loader was introduced at the end of 1958. It featured two independent front- drive wheels and a rear caster wheel, a engine and a lift capacity. Two years later they replaced the caster wheel with a rear axle and introduced the M-400, the first four-wheel, true skid-steer loader. The M-440 was powered by a engine and had an rated operating capacity. Skid-steer development continued into the mid-1960s with the M600 loader.

The list of attachments available is virtually endless. Some examples include backhoe, hydraulic breaker, pallet forks, angle broom, sweeper, auger, mower, snow blower, stump grinder, tree spade, trencher, dumping hopper, pavement miller, ripper, tillers, grapple, tilt, roller, snow blade, wheel saw, cement mixer, and wood chipper machine. Some models of skid steer now also have an automatic attachment changer mechanism. This allows a driver to change between a variety of terrain handling, shaping, and leveling tools without having to leave the machine, by using a hydraulic control mechanism to latch onto the attachments. Traditionally hydraulic supply lines to powered attachments may be routed so that the couplings are located near the cab, and the driver does not need to leave the machine to connect or disconnect those supply lines. Recently, manufacturers have also created automatic hydraulic connection systems that allow changing attachments without having to manually disconnect/connect hydraulic lines  Loader-arm design  Lift mechanism of a skid loader of the powered-triad type The original skid- steer loader arms were designed using a hinge at the rear of the machine to pivot the loader arm up into the air in an arc that swings up over the top of the operator. This is known as a radial lift loader. This design is simpler to manufacturer, offers better rear visibility, greater reach at truck bed height, and tends to be preferred for users who do a lot of digging. The downsides are it limits the usable height to how long the loader arm is and the height of that pivot point. In the raised position the front of the loader arm moves towards the rear of the machine, requiring the operator to move extremely close to or press up against the side of a tall container or other transport vehicle to get the bucket close enough to dump accurately. At the highest arm positions the bucket may overflow the rear of the bucket and spill directly onto the top of the machine's cab, although this was mitigated greatly by automatic bucket leveling designs. Radial arm is still the most common design and preferred by many users. Vertical lift designs use multiple hinges and parallel lifting bars on the loader arm, with the main pivot points towards the center or front of the machine. This allows the loader arm to have greater operating height while retaining a compact design, and allows the vertical movement almost completely straight-up vertical, to keep the bucket forward of the operator's cab, allowing safe dumping into tall containers or vehicles. The downside being added complexity and cost, reduced rear visibility, and reduced reach at typical truck bed height. Vertical lift designs are growing rapidly in popularity and now make up a significant proportion of new skid loader sales. Applications A skid-steer loader can sometimes be used in place of a large excavator by digging a hole from the inside. The skid loader first digs a ramp leading to the edge of the desired excavation. It then uses the ramp to carry material out of the hole. The skid loader reshapes the ramp making it steeper and longer as the excavation deepens. This method is particularly useful for digging under a structure where overhead clearance does not allow for the boom of a large excavator, such as digging a basement under an existing house. Several companies make backhoe attachments for skid-steers. These are more effective for digging in a small area than the method above and can work in the same environments. Other applications may consist of transporting raw material around a job site, or assisting in the rough grading process.

The 30‚Äì40 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Origin of names The common English name hornbeam derives from the hardness of the woods (likened to horn) and the Old English beam \\"tree\\" (cognate with German Baum). The American hornbeam is also occasionally known as blue-beech, ironwood, or musclewood, the first from the resemblance of the bark to that of the American beech Fagus grandifolia, the other two from the hardness of the wood and the muscular appearance of the trunk, respectively. The botanic name for the genus, Carpinus, is the original Latin name for the European species. Taxonomy Though some botanists grouped them with the hazels (Corylus) and hop-hornbeams (Ostrya) in a segregated family, Corylaceae, modern botanists place the hornbeams in the birch subfamily Coryloideae.  Description  European hornbeam in Germany, during May Hornbeams are small to medium-sized trees, Carpinus betulus reaching a height of 32 m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3‚Äì10 cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3‚Äì6 mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing is important in the identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10‚Äì30 seeds are on each seed catkin.  Distribution  The 30‚Äì40 species occur across much of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, with the greatest number of species in east Asia, particularly China. Only two species occur in Europe, only one in eastern North America, and one in Mesoamerica.Flora of China, Vol. 4 Page 289, ÈπÖËÄ≥Êû•Â±û e er li shu, Carpinus Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 998. 1753. Flora of North America, Vol. 3, Hornbeam, Carpinus Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 998. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed. 5, 432, 1754. Carpinus betulus can be found in Europe, Turkey and Ukraine. Associated insects Hornbeams are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including autumnal moth, common emerald, feathered thorn, walnut sphinx, Svensson's copper underwing, and winter moth (recorded on European hornbeam) as well as the Coleophora case-bearers C. currucipennella and C. ostryae. Applications Hornbeam trunk Hornbeams yield a very hard timber, giving rise to the name \\"ironwood\\". Dried heartwood billets are nearly white and are suitable for decorative use. For general carpentry, hornbeam is rarely used, partly due to the difficulty of working it. The wood is used to construct carving boards, tool handles, handplane soles, coach wheels, piano actions, shoe lasts, and other products where a very tough, hard wood is required. The wood can also be used as gear pegs in simple machines, including traditional windmills. It is sometimes coppiced to provide hardwood poles. It is also used in parquet flooring and for making chess pieces.

Afro-Blue: Improvisations in African American Poetry and Culture. University of Illinois Press. . History In addition to guitar-based blues, jug bands, such as Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers and the Memphis Jug Band, were extremely popular practitioners of Memphis blues. The jug band style emphasized the danceable, syncopated rhythms of early jazz and a range of other folk styles. It was played on simple, sometimes homemade, instruments such as harmonicas, violins, mandolins, banjos, and guitars, backed by washboards, kazoo, guimbarde and jugs blown to supply the bass. After World War II, as African Americans left the Mississippi Delta and other impoverished areas of the South for urban areas, many musicians gravitated to the blues scene in Memphis, changing the classic Memphis blues sound. Musicians such as Howlin' Wolf, Willie Nix, Ike Turner, and B.B.King performed on Beale Street and in West Memphis and recorded some of the classic electric blues, rhythm-and-blues and rock-and- roll records for labels such as Sam Phillips's Sun Records.

Explanation  As globalization integrates the economies of neighboring and of trading states, they are typically forced to trade off such rules as part of a common tax, tariff and trade regime, e.g. as defined by a free trade pact. Investment policy favoring local investors over global ones is typically discouraged in such pacts, and the idea of a separate investment policy rapidly becomes a fiction or fantasy, as real decisions reflect the real need for nations to compete for investment, even from their own local investors. A strong and central criticism of the new global rules, made by many in the anti-globalization movement, is that guarantees are often available to foreign investors that are not available to local small investors, and that capital flight is encouraged by such free trade pacts.  Policy drivers  Investment policy in many nations is tied to immigration policy, either due to a desire to prevent human capital flight by forcing investors to keep local assets in local investments, or by a desire to attract immigrants by offering passports in a safe haven nation, e.g. Canada, in exchange for a substantial investment in a business that will create jobs there. A frequent criticism of such joint immigration-investment policy is that they encourage organized crime by providing incentive for money- laundering and safe places for \\"bosses\\" to move to when the heat rises in their home country.

His teachings followed those of Plato, which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements. He was also an avid student of the council of the thirty-three. He distinguished three forms of being: the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. He considered unity and duality to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In ethics, he taught that virtue produces happiness, but external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose. Life Xenocrates was a native of Chalcedon.Cicero, Academica, i. 4; Athenaeus, xii.; Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 3; Suda, Xenocrates By the most probable calculation; comp. Censorinus, c. 15 he was born 396/5 BC, and died 314/3 BC at the age of 82. His father was named Agathon () or Agathanor ().Suda Encyclopedia, xi,42 Moving to Athens in early youth, he became the pupil of Aeschines Socraticus,Athenaeus, ix but subsequently joined himself to Plato, whom he accompanied to Sicily in 361. Upon his master's death, he paid a visit with Aristotle to Hermias of Atarneus.Strabo, xii. In 339/8 BC, Xenocrates succeeded Speusippus in the presidency of the school, defeating his competitors Menedemus of Pyrrha and Heraclides Ponticus by a few votes. On three occasions he was member of an Athenian legation, once to Philip, twice to Antipater. Xenocrates resented the Macedonian influence then dominant at Athens. Soon after the death of Demosthenes (c. 322 BC), he declined the citizenship offered to him at the insistence of Phocion as a reward for his services in negotiating peace with Antipater after Athens' unsuccessful rebellion. The settlement was reached \\"at the price of a constitutional change: thousands of poor Athenians were disenfranchised,\\" and Xenocrates said \\"that he did not want to become a citizen within a constitution he had struggled to prevent\\". citing and . Being unable to pay the tax levied upon resident aliens, he is said to have been saved only by the courage of the orator Lycurgus,Plutarch, Flamin. c. 12, X. Orat. Vitae, 7; but compare Phocion, c. 29 or even to have been bought by Demetrius Phalereus, and then emancipated. In 314/3, he died from hitting his head, after tripping over a bronze pot in his house. Xenocrates was succeeded as scholarch by Polemon, whom he had reclaimed from a life of profligacy. Besides Polemon, the statesman Phocion, Chaeron (tyrant of Pellene), the academic Crantor, the Stoic Zeno and Epicurus are said to have frequented his lectures.

Xenocrates adhered closely to the Platonist doctrine, and he is accounted the typical representative of the Old Academy. In his writings, which were numerous, he seems to have covered nearly the whole of the Academic program; but metaphysics and ethics were the subjects which principally engaged his thoughts. He is said to have made more explicit the division of philosophy into the three parts of Physics, Dialectic and Ethics. When Alexander the Great sent him 30 talents of gold, he sent it back, saying that a king, not a philosopher, needs money.

Besides philosophical treatises, he wrote poetry (epƒì) and paraenesis. Philosophy =Epistemology= Xenocrates made a more definite division between the three departments of philosophy, than Speusippus,Sextus Empiricus, adv. Math. vii. 16 but at the same time abandoned Plato's heuristic method of conducting through doubts (aporiai), and adopted instead a mode of bringing forward his doctrines in which they were developed dogmatically.Sextus Empiricus, Hypotyp. i. 2; comp. Cicero, Academica, i. 4; Xenocrates recognized three grades of cognition, each appropriated to a region of its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which is the object of pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavored, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception.Sextus Empiricus, adv. Math. vii. 147, etc. All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent,Simplicius, in Arist. Categ. iii. f. 6, b attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories. =Metaphysics= We know from PlutarchPlutarch, de Animae procreat. e Tim. that Xenocrates, if he did not explain the Platonic construction of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the Timaeus; and furtherAristotle, de Caelo, i. 10, 32, Metaph. xiv. 4 that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give us any further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number.Plutarch, de Animae procreat. e Tim., comp. Aristotle, de Anima, i. 2, 4, Anal. Post. ii. 4, ib. Interp. Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (monas and duas) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven,Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 62 or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, the last, or outermost.Plutarch, Plat. Quaest. ix. 1; Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, v. 604 If, like other Platonists, he designated the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by him as the first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude in the sphere of the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene.Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 62; Plutarch, de Orac. defect.; Cicero, de Natura Deorum, i. 13 The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity. It is not until we get to the sphere of the separate daemonical powers of nature that the opposition between good and evil begins,Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad one.Plutarch, de Isid. et Os., de Orac. defect.; Aristotle, Topica, ii. 2; Stobaeus, Serm, civ. 24 How Xenocrates tried to establish and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books on the nature of the gods,Cicero, de Natura Deorum, i. 13 we do not learn, and can only discover the one fundamental idea at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking.Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, v. 590 But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul;Plutarch, de Fac. in orbe lunae doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.Nemesius, De Natura Hominis It is probable, that, after the example of Plato, he designated the divine principium as alone indivisible, and remaining like itself; the material, as the divisible, partaking of multiformity, and different, and that from the union of the two, or from the limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity, he deduced number, and for that reason called the soul of the universe, like that of individual beings, a self-moving number, which, by virtue of its twofold root in the same and the different, shares equally in permanence and motion, and attains to consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this opposition. Aristotle, in his Metaphysics,Aristotle, Metaph. vii.2.1028 recognized amongst contemporary Platonists three principal views concerning the ideal numbers, and their relation to the ideas and to mathematical numbers: #those who, like Plato, distinguished ideal and mathematical numbers; #those who, like Xenocrates, identified ideal numbers with mathematical numbers #those who, like Speusippus, postulated mathematical numbers only Aristotle has much to say against the Xenocratean interpretation of the theory, and in particular points out that, if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical units, they not only cease to be principles, but also become subject to arithmetical operations. In the derivation of things according to the series of the numbers he seems to have gone further than any of his predecessors.Theophrastus, Met. c. 3 He approximated to the Pythagoreans in this, that (as is clear from his explanation of the soul) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness, and consequently of knowledge also; he thought it necessary, however, to supply what was wanting in the Pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition, borrowed from Plato, that it is only insofar as number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different, and has raised itself to self-motion, that it is soul. We find a similar attempt at the supplementation of the Platonic doctrine in Xenocrates's assumption of indivisible lines.Aristotle, de Lin. insec. Phys. Ausc. vi. 2; comp. Simplicius, in Arist. Phys. f. 30 In them he thought he had discovered what, according to Plato,Plato Timaeus God alone knows, and he among men who is loved by him, namely, the elements or principia of the Platonic triangles. He seems to have described them as first, original lines, and in a similar sense to have spoken of original plain figures and bodies,Simplicius, in Arist. de Caelo convinced that the principia of the existent should be sought not in the material, not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon, but merely in the ideal definitude of form. He may very well, in accordance with this, have regarded the point as a merely subjectively admissible presupposition, and a passage of Aristotle respecting this assumptionAristotle, de Anima, i. 4, extr. should perhaps be referred to him. =Ethics= The information on his Ethics is scanty. He tried to supplement the Platonic doctrine at various points, and at the same time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad.Sextus Empiricus, adv. Math. xi. 4 Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this.Cicero, de Legibus, i. 13 Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose. Xenocrates, depicted as a medieval scholar in the Nuremberg Chronicle While, however, Xenocrates (and with him Speusippus and the other philosophers of the older Academy)Cicero, de Finibus, iv. 18, etc. would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent.Cicero, de Legibus, i. 21 According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse what is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, v. 10, 18. Still he maintained that virtue alone is valuable in itself, and that the value of every thing else is conditional.Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, v. 10, 18., comp. Academica, i. 6 According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue,Aristotle, Topica, ii. 6, vii. 1, ib. Alex. though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong.Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, v. 13, comp. 17, de Finibus, ii. 11; Seneca, Epistulae, 85 In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without which external good things cannot be attained,Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, ii.; comp. Cicero, de Finibus, iv. 7, v. 9, Academica, ii. 44, 45, Tusculanae Quaestiones, iv. 10, 26, 31 and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people,Clement of Alexandria, Stromata; Cicero, Academica, ii. 44, 45 and therefore seems to have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, defining, and applying.Aristotle, Topica, vi. 3 How decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, that it comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one's feet upon the property of others.Aelian, Varia Historia, xiv. 42 His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of children should be guarded against the poison of immoral speeches.Plutarch, de Audit. =Mathematics= Xenocrates is known to have written a book On Numbers, and a Theory of Numbers, besides books on geometry. Plutarch writes that Xenocrates once attempted to find the total number of syllables that could be made from the letters of the alphabet.Plutarch, Quaest. Conviv. According to Plutarch, Xenocrates result was 1,002,000,000,000 (a \\"myriad-and- twenty times a myriad-myriad\\"). This possibly represents the first instance that a combinatorial problem involving permutations was attempted. Xenocrates also supported the idea of \\"indivisible lines\\" (and magnitudes) in order to counter Zeno's paradoxes.Simplicius, in Arist. Phys.

Kahn-Harris, Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge (Berg Publishers, 2007), , p. 31. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, The Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol) and Sweden (Candlemass, and later, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  Characteristics  = Instrumentation = The electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum kit are the most common instruments used to play doom metal (although keyboards are sometimes used), but its structures are rooted in the same scales as in blues. Guitarists and bassists often down tune their instruments to very low notes and make use of large amounts of distortion, thus producing a very \\"thick\\" or \\"heavy\\" guitar tone, which is one of the defining characteristics of the genre. Along with the usual heavy metal compositional technique of guitars and bass playing the same riff in unison, this creates a loud and bass-heavy wall of sound. Another defining characteristic is the consistent focus on slow tempos, and minor tonality with much use of dissonance (especially in the form of the tritone), employing the usage of repetitive rhythms with little regard to harmonic progression and musical structure. = Vocals = Traditional doom metal vocalists favor clean vocals, which are often performed with a sense of despair, desperation, or pain; imitating the high-tone wails of Ozzy Osbourne (Black Sabbath), Frank Ferrara (Bang), Bobby Liebling (Pentagram), and Zeeb Parkes (Witchfinder General). So- called \\"epic doom\\" vocalists often take it a step further, singing in an operatic style. Doom metal bands influenced by other extreme metal genres often use growled or screamed vocals, as is the case of death-doom, black- doom, and funeral doom. = Lyrical themes = Lyrics in doom metal play a key role. Influenced by notable blues musicians like Robert Johnson and Son House, normally they are gloomy and pessimistic, including themes such as suffering, depression, fear, grief, dread, death, and anger. While some bands write lyrics in introspective and personal ways, others convey their themes using symbolism ‚Äì which may be inspired by occult arts and literature. Some doom metal bands use religious themes in their music. Trouble, one of the genre's pioneers, were among the first to incorporate Christian imagery. Others have incorporated occult and pagan imagery. For many bands, the use of religious themes is for aesthetic and symbolic purposes only. Examples include lyrics/imagery about the Last Judgment to invoke dread, or the use of crucifixes and cross-shaped headstones to symbolize death. Furthermore, some doom metal bands write lyrics about drugs or drug addiction. This is most common among stoner doom bands, who often describe hallucinogenic or psychedelic experiences.  History  Tony Iommi's guitar style greatly influenced and defined doom metal. = Origins (1970s) = Doom metal is rooted in the music of early Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath's music is (in and of) itself stylistically rooted in blues, but with the deliberately doomy and loud guitar playing of Tony Iommi, and the then-uncommon dark and pessimistic lyrics and atmosphere, they set the standards of early heavy metal and inspired various doom metal bands. In the early 1970s, both Black Sabbath and Pentagram (also as side band \\"Bedemon\\") composed and performed this heavy and dark music, which would in the 1980s begin to be known and referred to as doom metal by subsequent musicians, critics and fans. Aside from Pentagram and Black Sabbath, other groups from the 1970s would heavily influence the genre's development. Blue Cheer is often hailed as one of the first stoner metal bands. Through the use of loud amplifiers and guitar feedback, their debut Vincebus Eruptum created a template for other artists to follow. Though lacking the pessimistic lyrical content of their contemporaries, Welsh heavy metal band Budgie would also produce heavy songs which were amongst the loudest of their day, stylistically influencing various doom metal acts. Early doom metal was also influenced by Japan's Flower Travellin' Band, particularly their albums Kirikyogen and Satori. Bang's 1971 self-titled debut is considered an important forerunner to doom metal. Other notable groups include Sir Lord Baltimore, Buffalo, Necromandus,Christe (2003), pg. 345, \\"Beginning with the overlooked Lucifer's Friend and Necromandus in the early 1970s, doom crawled through the 1980s with Trouble, Witchfinder General, the Obsessed, Candlemass, Pentagram, and Saint Vitus, then into the 1990s with Cathedral, Sleep, and Burning Witch.\\" Lucifer's Friend, Iron Claw^ Sleazegrinder (March 2007). \\"The Lost Pioneers of Heavy Metal\\". Classic Rock. and Leaf Hound. = Development (1980s) = During the early-mid-1980s, bands from England and the United States contributed much to the formation of doom metal as a distinct genre. In 1982, English pioneers Witchfinder General released their debut album Death Penalty. During 1984, two American pioneers also released their debuts; Saint Vitus released their eponymous album and Trouble released Psalm 9. That same year American band Cirith Ungol (formed in 1971) released their second studio album, King of the Dead‚Äîregarded by many as an early influence on doom. The following year, American band Pentagram would go on to release their debut, Relentless. The Swedish Candlemass would also prove influential with their first record Epicus Doomicus Metallicus in 1986 (and prior to that the 1984 album, Day of Retribution as Nemesis), from which the genre takes its name. Some doom metal bands were also influenced by the underground gothic rock and post-punk scene of the 1980s, showing similarities with the dark themes addressed through lyrics and the music atmosphere, both music styles deal with. A doom metal band like Mindrot was often described as a cross-over between death metal and gothic rock.  Regional scenes  Like other extreme metal genres, doom metal also has regionally based scenes, with their own particular characteristics: = Finnish doom metal = In one of the greatest doom metal outputs, Finnish groups focus more on the depressive mood of the genre, evoking an intense grieving feeling. The bands play with very slow tempos and melodic tones, creating an atmosphere of darkness and melancholia. This scene was kick-started by the band Rigor Mortis (which, due to an older US band with the same name, changed their name to Spiritus Mortis), which originated in 1987. Notable bands include Reverend Bizarre, Minotauri, Dolorian, Shape of Despair, Thergothon, Skepticism, and Unholy. = Louisiana doom metal = Regarded as sludge metal's birthplace, this scene originated in New Orleans in the late 1980s. The bands of this scene employ some punk influences, like harsh vocals, guitar distortion and downtuned sound. This scene was pioneered by Exhorder, who was the first band to combine doom metal with a punk-influenced metal sound. In the 90s, several sludge and stoner metal bands arose in the state, mainly influenced by bands like Black Sabbath and Melvins, also mixing their sound with genres like hardcore punk and Southern rock. Notable bands include Eyehategod, Down Exhorder, Crowbar, and Acid Bath\\"Modern hardcore music scene\\". Metalhammer magazine No.32.Mahoney, Steve (March 30, 1995). \\"Acid Bath's not famous but it is one hot band\\". jsonline.com, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. = Washington D.C. doom metal = This scene formed in the early 1970s and was kickstarted by Pentagram and The Obsessed. Various doom/stoner bands, mostly from Washington, D.C. and its metropolitan area on Maryland and Virginia (thus also being labelled \\"Maryland doom sound\\"), formed in this region being heavily influenced by early hard rock and heavy metal bands, like UFO, Blue Cheer, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Sir Lord Baltimore. This scene is also known as \\"Hellhound sound\\" for being closely related to the late Hellhound Records, who signed with many important bands of the scene like Saint Vitus, Internal Void, Iron Man, Revelation, Wretched and Unorthodox. Other notable bands include Evoken, Spirit Caravan, Earthride, and The Hidden Hand. = Pacific Northwest doom metal = The Pacific Northwest region ‚Äì primarily Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia ‚Äì has been host to a growing scene of doom, sludge, and stoner metal since the 1990s. It is influenced by the geographical origin of grunge music and a sound pioneered in part by Washington band The Melvins. Common visual themes include the region's cold, rainy, forested climate, and many bands utilize psychedelic imagery influenced by bands like Sleep, Karp and Harkonen. Musical styles often share crossover features with atmospheric/ambient black metal, drone metal, and post-metal as seen in Oregon's YOB, Agalloch, Witch Mountain, and Red Fang; Washington's Earth, and Sunn O))); and Vancouver's Anciients, Astrakhan, and Aaron Turner project Sumac, among various others. = Palm Desert Scene= Palm Desert, California, hosts a thriving desert rock and stoner metal scene, drawing heavy influences from psychedelia, blues and hardcore punk, often featuring distinctive repetitive drum beats, a propensity for free-form jamming, and \\"trance-like\\" or \\"sludgy\\" grooves. Because of their integration, the term \\"stoner rock\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"desert rock\\". Notable bands include Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age, Dali's Llama, Slo Burn,\\"Slo Burn\\". allmusic.com. Retrieved on October 5, 2013. and Brant Bjork.  Stylistic divisions  = Black-doom = Black-doom, also known as blackened doom, is a style that combines the slowness and thicker, bassier sound of doom metal with the shrieking vocals and heavily distorted guitar sound of black metal. Black- doom bands maintain the Satanic ideology associated with black metal, while melding it with moodier themes more related to doom metal, like depression, nihilism, and nature. They also use the slower pace of doom metal in order to emphasize the harsh atmosphere present in black metal. Examples of black-doom bands include Barathrum, Forgotten Tomb, Woods of Ypres, Deinonychus, Shining, Nortt, Bethlehem, early Katatonia, Tiamat, Dolorian, October Tide, and In the Woods....  Depressive suicidal black metal  Pioneered by black-doom bands like Opthalamia, Katatonia, Bethlehem, Forgotten Tomb, and Shining, depressive suicidal black metal, also known as suicidal black metal, depressive black metal, or DSBM, is a style that melds the second wave-style of black metal with doom metal, with lyrics revolving around themes such as depression, self-harm, misanthrophy, suicide, and death. DSBM bands draw the lo-fi recording and highly distorted guitars of black metal, while employing the usage of acoustic instruments and non-distorted electric guitar's timbres present in doom metal, interchanging the slower, doom-like, sections with faster tremolo picking. Vocals are usually high-pitched like in black metal, but lacking of energy, simulating feelings like hopelessness, desperation, and plea. The presence of one-man bands is more proeminent in this genre compared to others. Examples of bands include Xasthur, Leviathan, Strid, Silencer, Make a Change... Kill Yourself, and I Shalt Become. = Blackened death-doom = Blackened death-doom is a genre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal. Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast, Faustcoven, The Ruins of Beverast, Bolzer, Necros Christos, Harvest Gulgaltha, Dragged into Sunlight, Hands of Thieves, and Soulburn. = Death-doom = My Dying Bride at Frozen Rock Fest. 2007 Death-doom is a style that combines the slow tempos and pessimistic atmosphere of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal.\\"Doom Metal Special: Doom/Death\\", Terrorizer #142. Influenced mostly by the early work of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, the style emerged during the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s. Death-doom was pioneered by bands such as Winter, Disembowelment, Paradise Lost, Autopsy, Anathema, and My Dying Bride.  Funeral doom  Funeral doom is a genre that crosses death-doom with funeral dirge music. It is played at a very slow tempo, and places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair. Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted and dark ambient aspects such as keyboards or synthesizers are often used to create a \\"dreamlike\\" atmosphere. Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background. Funeral doom was pioneered by Mournful Congregation, Esoteric, Evoken, Funeral, Thergothon,Hinchcliffe, James (April 2006). \\"Funeral Doom / Dron Doom: Hearse Play\\", Terrorizer #143, pp.44‚Äì45. and Skepticism.James Minton, Kim Kelly, and Jenn Selby, \\"Filth Parade\\", Terrorizer #188, September 2009, p. 56. = Drone metal = Sunn O))) performing live Drone metal (also known as drone doom) is a style of doom metal that is largely defined by drones; notes or chords that are sustained and repeated throughout a piece of music.John Wray, \\"Heady Metal\\", New York Times, May 28, 2006. Access date: August 18, 2008.Jan Tumlir, \\"Primal dirge\\", Artforum, April 2006. Access date: August 22, 2008.Brandon Stosuy, \\"Heavy Metal: It's Alive and Flourishing\\", Slate, August 19, 2005. Access date: August 22, 2008. Typically, the electric guitar is performed with large amounts of reverb and feedback while lacking the presence of drums and vocals. Songs are often very long and lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense. Drone metal is generally influenced by drone music, noise music, and minimalist music. The style emerged in the early 1990s and was pioneered by Earth,Jason Jackowiak, \\"Earth: Hex: Or Printing in the Infernal Method\\" , Splendid, September 14, 2005. Access date: August 23, 2008. Boris, and Sunn O))). = Epic doom = Epic doom has a heavy classical influence. One of the main characteristics are the vocals; vocalists typically employ clean, operatic, and choral singing, accompanied by keyboarding and drumming performed in a bombastic fashion in order to evoke an \\"epic\\" sensation. Lyrics and imagery are typically inspired by fantasy or mythology. Examples of prominent epic doom bands include Candlemass, Solitude Aeturnus,Santos, Jos√© Carlos (2012). \\"Epicus Doomicus Metallicus\\". In Terrorizer 's Secret History of Doom Metal, pp. 60‚Äì62, Solstice, While Heaven Wept, and Doomsword. = Gothic-doom = Gothic-doom, also known as doom- gothic, is a style that combines more traditional elements of doom metal with gothic rock. Gothic-doom bands usually play at slow and mid-tempos and employ the usage of instruments that are more related to classical music, alongside traditional doom metal instruments, in order to create darker and meditative atmospheres. Doom-gothic lyrics combines the dramatic and romantic elements of gothic rock with the sorrowness and melancholy present in doom metal, while being more introspective and focused on personal experiences such as love, grief, irreparable loss, loss of faith, etc. Unlike in gothic metal and death- doom, gothic-doom bands prefer the use of cleaner vocals instead of employing death growls, although some of them employ harsher vocals occasionally, and avoid the usage of death metal-like riffage. Bands labelled as gothic-doom include Weeping Silence, The Foreshadowing, Grave Lines, Artrosis, Ava Inferi, Draconian, and Type O Negative. = Progressive doom = Progressive doom is a fusion genre that combines elements of progressive metal and doom metal. Notable bands include King Goat, Below the Sun, Sierra, and Oceans of Slumber. = Sludge metal = Sludge metal (also known as sludge doom or sludgecore) is a style that combines doom metal and hardcore punk, and sometimes Southern rock. Many sludge bands compose slow and heavy songs that contain brief hardcore passages. However, some bands emphasise fast tempos throughout their music. The string instruments are heavily distorted and are often played with large amounts of feedback to produce an abrasive, sludgy sound. Drumming is often performed in typical doom metal fashion, but drummers may employ hardcore d-beat or double-kick drumming during faster passages. Vocals are usually shouted or screamed, and lyrics often focus on suffering, drug abuse, politics and anger towards society. The style was pioneered in the early late 1980s by the Melvins, and in the 1990s by bands such as Eyehategod, Crowbar, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath, and Grief. = Stoner metal = Jus Oborn of Electric Wizard Stoner metal or stoner doom describes doom metal that incorporates psychedelic rock and acid rock elements. Stoner metal is often heavily distorted, groove-laden bass-heavy sound, making much use of guitar effects such as fuzz, phaser, or flanger. Stoner bands typically play in slow-to-mid tempo, employing the usage of melodic vocals and \\"retro\\" production. It was pioneered in the early‚Äìmid-1990s by bands such as Kyuss, Sleep, Acid King, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, and Sons of Otis. = Traditional doom = Influenced by 70s and 80s heavy metal, traditional doom metal bands more commonly use higher guitar tunings, and do not play as slow as many other doom bands. Traditional doom bands typically play slow to mid-tempo songs with a thick and heavy sound with the electric bass following the melody line, and sometimes employ the usage of keyboards, although assuming a secondary role on traditional doom metal songs. Vocals are usually clean with the occasional growl or scream. The lyrics in traditional doom usually are eerie and dark like other doom metal divisions. Some bands who play traditional doom metal are Orodruin, Reverend Bizarre, Witchcraft, Saint Vitus, and Count Raven.

The government takes measures \\"aimed at improving the competitiveness and capabilities of domestic firms and promoting structural transformation.\\" A country's infrastructure (including transportation, telecommunications and energy industry) is a major enabler of the wider economy and so often has a key role in IP.For the relations between industrial policy and infrastructure, see Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 12‚Äì51. Industrial policies are interventionist measures typical of mixed economy countries. Many types of industrial policies contain common elements with other types of interventionist practices such as trade policy. Industrial policy is usually seen as separate from broader macroeconomic policies, such as tightening credit and taxing capital gains. Traditional examples of industrial policy include subsidizing export industries and import- substitution-industrialization (ISI), where trade barriers are temporarily imposed on some key sectors, such as manufacturing. By selectively protecting certain industries, these industries are given time to learn (learning by doing) and upgrade. Once competitive enough, these restrictions are lifted to expose the selected industries to the international market. More contemporary industrial policies include measures such as support for linkages between firms and support for upstream technologies.  History  The traditional arguments for industrial policies go back as far as the 18th century. Prominent early arguments in favor of selective protection of industries were contained in the 1791 Report on the Subject of Manufactures of US economist and politician Alexander Hamilton, as well as the work of German economist Friedrich List. List's views on free trade were in explicit contradiction to those of Adam Smith, who, in The Wealth of Nations, said that \\"the most advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of its own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all other nations.\\" The arguments of List and others were subsequently picked up by scholars of early development economics such as Albert Hirschman and Alexander Gerschenkron, who called for the selective promotion of key sectors in overcoming economic backwardness. The relationship between government and industry in the United States has never been a simple one, and the labels used in categorizing these relationships at different times are often misleading if not false. In the early nineteenth century, for example, \\"it is quite clear that the laissez faire label is an inappropriate one.\\" In the US, an industrial policy was explicitly presented for the first time by the Jimmy Carter administration in August 1980, but it was subsequently dismantled with the election of Ronald Reagan the following year. Historically, there is a growing consensus that most developed countries, including United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and France, have intervened actively in their domestic economy through industrial policies. These early examples are followed by interventionist ISI strategies pursued in Latin American countries such as Brazil, Mexico or Argentina. More recently, the rapid growth of East Asian economies, or the newly industrialized countries (NICs), has also been associated with active industrial policies that selectively promoted manufacturing and facilitated technology transfer and industrial upgrading. The success of these state-directed industrialization strategies are often attributed to developmental states and strong bureaucracies such as the Japanese MITI. According to Princeton's Atul Kohli, the reason Japanese colonies such as South Korea developed so rapidly and successfully was down to Japan exporting to its colonies the same centralised state development that it had used to develop itself. Precisely speaking, South Korea's development can be explained by the fact that it followed the similar industrial policies that UK, US and Germany implemented, and South Korea adopted Export-Oriented Industrialization (EOI) policy from 1964 based on its own decision contrary to the Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) policy touted by international aid organizations and experts at that time.Koh 2018, pp. 28‚Äì39. Many of these domestic policy choices, however, are now seen as detrimental to free trade and are hence limited by various international agreements such as WTO TRIMs or TRIPS. Instead, the recent focus for industrial policy has shifted towards the promotion of local business clusters and the integration into global value chains. During the Reagan administration, an economic development initiative called Project Socrates was initiated to address US decline in ability to compete in world markets. Project Socrates, directed by Michael Sekora, resulted in a computer-based competitive strategy system that was made available to private industry and all other public and private institutions that impact economic growth, competitiveness and trade policy. A key objective of Socrates was to utilize advanced technology to enable US private institutions and public agencies to cooperate in the development and execution of competitive strategies without violating existing laws or compromising the spirit of \\"free market\\". President Reagan was satisfied that this objective was fulfilled in the Socrates system. Through the advances of innovation age technology, Socrates would provide \\"voluntary\\" but \\"systematic\\" coordination of resources across multiple \\"economic system\\" institutions including industry clusters, financial service organizations, university research facilities and government economic planning agencies. While the view of one US President and the Socrates team was that technology made it virtually possible for both to exist simultaneously, the industrial policy vs. free market debate continued as later under the George H. W. Bush administration, Socrates was labeled as industrial policy and de-funded. Following the Financial Crisis of 2007‚Äì08, many countries around the world ‚Äì including the US, UK, Australia, Japan and most countries of the European Union ‚Äì have adopted industry policies. However contemporary industry policy generally accepts globalisation as a given, and focuses less on the decline of older industries, and more on the growth of emergent industries. It often involves government working collaboratively with industry to respond to challenges and opportunities. China is a prominent case where the central and subnational governments intervene in nearly all economic sectors and processes. Even though market mechanisms have gained in importance, the state control prevails. In order to catch-up and even overtake industrialised countries technologically, China's \\"state activities even extend to efforts to prevent the dominance of foreign investors and technologies in areas considered to be of key significance such as the strategic industries and the new technologies\\" including robotics and new energy vehicles.  Criticism  The main criticism against industrial policy arises from the concept of government failure. Industrial policy is seen as harmful as governments lack the required information, capabilities and incentives to successfully determine whether the benefits of promoting certain sectors above others exceeds the costs and in turn implement the policies.See for instance, regarding the medias industries: Violaine Hacker, ¬´ Citoyennet√© culturelle et politique europ√©enne des m√©dias : entre comp√©titivit√© et promotion des valeurs ¬ª, Nations, Cultures et Entreprises en Europe, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris, pp. 163‚Äì84 While the East Asian Tigers provided successful examples of heterodox interventions and protectionist industrial policies, industrial policies such as import-substitution-industrialization (ISI) have failed in many other regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Governments, in making decisions with regard to electoral or personal incentives, can be captured by vested interests, leading to industrial policies supporting local rent-seeking political elites while distorting the efficient allocation of resources by market forces.  Debates on process  Despite criticism, there is a consensus in recent development theory that says state interventions may be necessary when market failures occur. Market failures often exist in the form of externalities and natural monopolies. Such market failures may hinder the emergence of a well-functioning market and corrective industrial policies are required to ensure the allocative efficiency of a free market. Even relatively-sceptical economists now recognise that public action can boost certain development factors \\"beyond what market forces on their own would generate.\\" In practice, these interventions are often aimed at regulating networks, public infrastructure, R&D; or correcting information asymmetries. While the current debate has shifted away from dismissing industrial policies overall, the best ways of promoting industrial policy are still widely debated. One question is which kinds of industrial policy are most effective in promoting economic development. For example, economists debate whether developing countries should focus on their comparative advantage by promoting mostly resource- and labour-intensive products and services, or invest in higher-productivity industries, which may only become competitive in the longer term. Debate also surrounds the issue whether government failures are more pervasive and severe than market failures. Some argue that the lower the government accountability and capabilities, the higher the risk of political capture of industrial policies, which may be economically more harmful than existing market failures. Of particular relevance for developing countries are the conditions under which industrial policies may also contribute to poverty reduction, such as a focus on specific industries or the promotion of linkages between larger companies and smaller local enterprises.

Personal life Al Hirschfeld was born in a two-story duplex at 1313 Carr Street in St. Louis, and later moved with his family to New York City, where he received his art training at the Art Students League of New York. Following a divorce from Florence Ruth Hobby, in 1943, he married Broadway actress/performer Dolly Haas. Haas died from ovarian cancer in 1994, aged 84. They had one child, a daughter, Nina (b. 1945). In 1996, he married Louise Kerz, a theatre historian. Career In 1924, Hirschfeld traveled to Paris and London, where he studied painting, drawing and sculpture. When he returned to the United States, a friend, fabled Broadway press agent Richard Maney, showed one of Hirschfeld's drawings to an editor at the New York Herald Tribune, which got Hirschfeld commissions for that newspaper and then, later, The New York Times. Hirschfeld's style is unique, and he is considered to be one of the most important figures in contemporary drawing and caricature, having influenced countless artists, illustrators, and cartoonists. His caricatures were regularly drawings of pure line in black ink, for which he used a genuine crow quill. Readers of The New York Times and other newspapers prior to the time they printed in color will be most familiar with the Hirschfeld drawings that are black ink on white illustration board. However, there is a whole body of Hirschfeld's work in color. Hirschfeld's full-color paintings were commissioned by many magazines, often as the cover. Examples are TV Guide, Life Magazine, American Mercury, Look Magazine, The New York Times Magazine, The New Masses, and Seventeen Magazine. He also illustrated many books in color, most notably among them Harlem As Seen By Hirschfeld, with text by William Saroyan. Liza Minnelli, Minnelli on Minnelli, 1999. He was commissioned by CBS to illustrate a preview magazine featuring the network's new TV programming in fall 1963. One of the programs was Candid Camera, and Hirschfeld's caricature of the show's host Allen Funt outraged Funt so much he threatened to leave the network if the magazine were issued. Hirschfeld prepared a slightly different likeness, perhaps more flattering, but he and the network pointed out to Funt that the artwork prepared for newspapers and some other print media had been long in preparation and it was too late to withdraw it. Funt relented but insisted that what could be changed would have to be. Newsweek ran a squib on the controversy. =Broadway, film, and more= Hirschfeld started young and continued drawing to the end of his life, thus chronicling nearly all the major entertainment figures of the 20th century.The Hirschfeld Century : Portrait of an artist and his age, edited and with text by David Leopold, Knopf, 2015. During his eight-decade career, he gained fame by illustrating the actors, singers, and dancers of various Broadway plays, which would appear in advance in The New York Times to herald the play's opening. Though the theater was his best-known field of interest, according to Hirschfeld's art dealer Margo Feiden, he actually drew more for the movies than he did for live plays. \\"By the ripe old age of 17, while his contemporaries were learning how to sharpen pencils, Hirschfeld became an art director at Selznick Pictures. He held the position for about four years, and then in 1924 Hirschfeld moved to Paris to work and lead the Bohemian life. Hirschfeld also grew a beard, necessitated by the exigencies of living in a cold water flat. This he retained for the next 75 years, presumably because \\"you never know when your oil burner will go on the fritz.\\"Show Business is No Business (1983). New York: Da Capo Press, pp. Endnotes, In addition to Broadway and film, Hirschfeld also drew politicians, TV stars, and celebrities of all stripes from Cole Porter and the Nicholas Brothers to the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. He also caricatured jazz musicians‚Äî Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald‚Äîand rockers The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, and Mick Jagger. In 1977 he drew the cover of Aerosmith's Draw the Line album. Hirschfeld drew many original movie posters, including for Charlie Chaplin's films, as well as The Wizard of Oz (1939). The \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" segment in the Disney film Fantasia 2000 was inspired by his designs, and Hirschfeld became an artistic consultant for the segment; the segment's director, Eric Goldberg, is a longtime fan of his work. Further evidence of Goldberg's admiration for Hirschfeld can be found in Goldberg's character design and animation of the genie in Aladdin (1992). He was the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary film, The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story (1996). =Nina= In 1943, Hirschfeld married one of Europe's most famous actresses, Dolly Haas. They were married for more than 50 years, and had a daughter, Nina. Photograph by Carl Van Vechten, 1955 Hirschfeld is known for hiding Nina's name, written in capital letters (\\"NINA\\"), in most of the drawings he produced after her birth. The name would appear in a sleeve, in a hairdo, or somewhere in the background. As Margo Feiden described it, Hirschfeld engaged in the ‚Äúharmless insanity,‚Äù as he called it, of hiding her name at least once in each of his drawings. The number of NINAs concealed is shown by the number written to the right of his signature. Generally, if no number is to be found, either NINA appears once or the drawing was completed before she was born. For the first few months after Nina's birth, Hirschfeld intended the hidden NINAs to appeal to his circle of friends. But to his complete surprise, what he hadn't realized was that the population at large was beginning to spot them, too. When Hirschfeld thought the \\"gag\\" was wearing thin among his friends and stopped concealing NINAs in his drawings, letters to The New York Times ranging from \\"curious\\" to \\"furious\\" pressured him to begin hiding them again. He said it was easier to hide the NINAs than it was to answer all the mail. From time to time he lamented that the gimmick had overshadowed his art. In Hirschfeld's book Show Business is No Business, Feiden recounts the following story to illustrate what Hirschfeld meant when he referred to the \\"NINA counting\\" as a harmless insanity: \\"The NINA-counting mania was well illuminated when in 1973 an NYU student kept coming back to my Gallery to stare at the same drawing each day for more than a week. The drawing was Hirschfeld's whimsical portrayal of New York's Central Park. When curiosity finally got the best of me, I asked, 'What is so riveting about that one drawing that keeps you here for hours, day after day?' She answered that she had found only 11 of 39 NINAs and would not give up until all were located. I replied that the '39' next to Hirschfeld's signature was the year. Nina was born in 1945.\\" In his 1966 anthology The World of Hirschfeld, he included a drawing of Nina which he titled \\"Nina's Revenge.\\" That drawing contained no NINAs. There were, however, two ALs and two DOLLYs (\\"the names of her wayward parents\\"). In the Fantasia 2000 segment, the crimp of Duke the Builder's toothpaste tube contained a NINA in tribute to Hirschfeld. =Publications= American Mercury with Al Hirschfeld's caricature of Ernest Hemingway Al Hirschfeld famously contributed to The New York Times for more than seven decades. His work also appeared in The New York Herald Tribune, The Old World, The New Yorker Magazine, Collier's, The American Mercury, TV Guide, Playbill, New York magazine, and Rolling Stone.

Hirschfeld collaborated with humorist S. J. Perelman on several publications, including Westward Ha! Or, Around the World in 80 Clich√©s, a satirical look at the duo's travels on assignment for Holiday magazine. In 1991, the United States Postal Service commissioned him to draw a series of postage stamps commemorating famous American comedians. The collection included drawings of Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Edgar Bergen (with Charlie McCarthy), Jack Benny, Fanny Brice, Bud Abbott, and Lou Costello. He followed that with a collection of silent film stars including Rudolph Valentino, ZaSu Pitts and Buster Keaton. The Postal Service allowed him to include Nina's name in his drawings, waiving their own rule forbidding hidden messages in United States stamp designs. Hirschfeld expanded his audience by contributing to Patrick F. McManus' humor column in Outdoor Life magazine for a number of years. =Collections and tributes= Al Hirschfeld's desk and chair in the lobby of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts Permanent collections of Hirschfeld's work are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A permanent collection at the Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd. includes seventy-five years of Hirschfeld's original drawings, limited edition lithographs and etchings, and archives. The Martin Beck Theatre, which opened November 11, 1924, at 302 West 45th Street, was renamed to become the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on June 21, 2003. It reopened on November 23, 2003, with a revival of the musical Wonderful Town. Hirschfeld was also honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2002, Al Hirschfeld was awarded the National Medal of Arts. He was an Honorary Member of the Salmagundi Club. Death On January 20, 2003, Hirschfeld died of natural causes in his home at 122 East 95th Street in Manhattan. He was survived by his daughter Nina Hirschfeld West, and his third wife, Louise Kerz.

He learned philosophy first in Athens, and then, with his friend Asclepiades, he subsequently studied under Stilpo and Phaedo of Elis. Nothing survives of his philosophical views apart from a few scattered remarks recorded by later writers. Life Menedemus was born at Eretria. Though of noble birth, he worked as builder and tent maker until he was sent with a military expedition to Megara, from where he travelled to the Platonic Academy in Athens and resolved to devote himself to philosophy.La√´rtius says he was charmed by Plato himself, but Plato was dead by the time Menedemus was born . At Megara he formed a lifelong friendship with Asclepiades of Phlius, with whom he toiled in the night that he might study philosophy by day.Athenaeus, iv. 168 He was subsequently a pupil first of Stilpo and then of Phaedo of Elis, whose school he transferred to Eretria, by which name it was afterwards known. In addition to his philosophical work, he took a leading part in the political affairs of his city from the time of the Diadochi until his death, and obtained a remission of the tribute to Demetrius. His friendship with Antigonus II Gonatas seems to have roused suspicion as to his loyalty, and he sought safety first in the temple of Amphiaraus at Oropus, and later with Antigonus, at whose court he is said to have died of grief. Other accounts say that he starved himself to death on failing to induce Antigonus to free his native city. He was sent to Pyrrha to help them with government legislation according to Plutarch. Philosophy His philosophical views are known only in part. Athenaeus quotes Epicrates as stating that he was a Platonist, but other accounts credit him with having preferred Stilpo to Plato. Diogenes La√´rtius says that he declined to identify the Good with the Useful, and that he denied the value of the negative proposition on the ground that affirmation alone can express truth. In ethics we learn from PlutarchPlutarch, De Virtute Morali 2 and from CiceroCicero, Academica ii. 42 that he regarded Virtue as one, by whatever name it be called, and maintained that it is intellectual. Cicero's evidence is the less valuable in that he always assumed that Menedemus was a follower of the Megarian school. Diogenes says that he left no writings, and the Eretrian school disappeared after a short and unobtrusive existence.

Outcomes can involve, for example, a guaranteed supply level, price stability, product quality, product selection, land use or employment. Agriculture has large impacts on climate change, estimated to be contributing 20‚Äì25% of global annual emissions as of 2010.Blanco, G., et al., Section 5.3.5.4: Agriculture, Forestry, Other Land Use, in: Chapter 5: Drivers, Trends and Mitigation (archived 30 December 2014), in: Emissions aggregated using 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report Moreover, agriculture is highly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, such as decreases in water access, geophysical processes such as ocean level rise and changing weather, and socioeconomic processes that affect farmers, many of whom are in subsistence economic conditions. In order for global climate change mitigation and adaptation to be effective a wide range of policies need to be implemented to reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculturePorter, J.R., et al., Section 7.5: Adaptation and Managing Risks in Agriculture and Other Food System Activities, in Chapter 7: Food security and food production systems (archived 5 November 2014), in Oppenheimer, M., et al., Section 19.7.

Examples: training of skilled workers, the development of labor hire systems that provide continuity of work in industries with strong seasonal peaks, modern communication tools, investigating market opportunities, researching customer requirements, business planning including financial management, researching the latest farming techniques, risk management skills) * coordination (a more consistent national strategic agenda for agricultural research and development; more active involvement of research investors in collaboration with research providers developing programs of work; greater coordination of research activities across industries, research organisations and issues; and investment in human capital to ensure a skilled pool of research personnel in the future.) * technology (research, adoption, productivity, genetically modified (GM) crops, investments) * water (access rights, water trade, providing water for environmental outcomes, assignment of risk in response to the reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use, accounting for the sourcing and allocation of water) * resource access issues (management of native vegetation, the protection and enhancement of biodiversity, sustainability of productive agricultural resources, landholder responsibilities) = Poverty reduction = Agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75% of the world's poor who live in rural areas. Encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world. In addition, a recent Natural Resource Perspective paper by the Overseas Development Institute found that good infrastructure, education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor. =Biosecurity= The biosecurity concerns facing industrial agriculture can be illustrated by: * the threat to poultry and humans from H5N1; possibly caused by the use of animal vaccines * the threat to cattle and humans from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE); possibly caused by the unnatural feeding of cattle to cattle to minimize costs * the threat to industry profits from diseases like foot-and-mouth disease and citrus canker which increasing globalization makes harder to contain Avian influenza The use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats. H5N1 is an example of where this might have already occurred. According to the CDC article \\"H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza\\" by Robert G. Webster et al.: \\"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.\\"(CDC H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza by Robert G. Webster et al.) Dr. Robert Webster explains: \\"If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out the virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It's not just China. We can‚Äôt blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world.\\"(MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster) In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority. Julie Hall, who is in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, claimed that China's vaccinations might be masking the virus.(Reuters) The BBC reported that Dr. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: \\"The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected, and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there.\\"(BBC Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet 22 February 2006) Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as \\"mad cow disease\\", is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of cattle, which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century. In the UK, the country worst affected, 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed as a precaution.Brown, David. \\"The 'recipe for disaster' that killed 80 and left a ¬£5bn bill\\", The Daily Telegraph, June 19, 2001. The disease can be transmitted to human beings who eat or inhale material from infected carcasses. In humans, it is known as new variant Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and by June 2007, it had killed 165 people in Britain, and six elsewhere\\"Variant Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob Disease, June 2007\\" , The National Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob Disease Surveillance Unit, University of Edinburgh. The number of dead in the UK from Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease had reached 1,206 by June 4, 2007. with the number expected to rise because of the disease's long incubation period. Between 460,000 and 482,000 BSE-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989.\\"CJD deaths 'may have peaked'\\", BBC News, November 13, 2001. A British inquiry into BSE concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle, who are normally herbivores, the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal (MBM), which caused the infectious agent to spread.\\"BSE: Disease control & eradication - Causes of BSE\\" , Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, March 2007.\\"The BSE Inquiry\\" , led by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, report published October 2000. The origin of the disease itself remains unknown. The current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation, probably in the 1970s, and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphorus pesticides increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease.\\"Volume 1: Findings and Conclusions. Executive Summary of the Report of the Inquiry. 3. The cause of BSE\\" , Phillips Inquiry, October 2000. The infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures it is able to survive; this contributed to the spread of the disease in Britain, which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process. Another contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves instead of milk from their mothers.Harden, Blaine. \\"Supplements used in factory farming can spread disease\\", The Washington Post, December 28, 2003. Foot-and-mouth disease Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs. It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other bovids with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs. Humans are affected only very rarely. FMD occurs throughout much of the world, and while some countries have been free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern. In 1996, endemic areas included Asia, Africa, and parts of South America. North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have been free of FMD for many years. Most European countries have been recognized as free, and countries belonging to the European Union have stopped FMD vaccination. Infection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally, that is, the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock. The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well. Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls. Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease. Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health. Farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. One of the difficulties in vaccinating against FMD is the huge variation between and even within serotypes. There is no cross-protection between serotypes (meaning that a vaccine for one serotype won't protect against any others) and in addition, two strains within a given serotype may have nucleotide sequences that differ by as much as 30% for a given gene. This means that FMD vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved. Vaccination only provides temporary immunity that lasts from months to years. Therefore, rich countries maintain a policy of banning imports from all countries, not proven FMD-free by US or EU standards. This is a point of contention. Although this disease is not dangerous to humans and rarely fatal to otherwise healthy animals, it reduces milk and meat production. Outbreaks can be stopped quickly if farmers and transporters are forced to abide by existing rules. Therefore, (besides temporary discomfort to the animals), any outbreak in the rich world should not be much more as a localized, cyclical economic problem. For countries with free roaming wildlife it is nearly impossible to prove that they are entirely free of this disease. If they try they are forced to erect nationwide fences, which destroys wildlife migration. Because detecting and reporting of FMD have enormously improved and sped up, almost all poor countries could now safely create FMD-free export zones. But rich countries refuse to change the rules. In effect, many poor tropical countries have no chance to meet current rules, so they are still today banned from exporting meat, even if many of them are FMD-free. The result is that if drought hits, the poor try to cope by selling their few animals. This quickly saturates regional demand. The export ban then destroys the value of these animals, in effect destroying the most important coping mechanism of several hundreds of millions extremely poor households. The rules around meat exports have been changed many times, always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries, usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries. For that reason Kanya and many other countries find the rules very unjust. They are however discouraged to file a formal complaint with WTO by diplomats from rich countries. Citrus canker Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species that is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis. The infection causes lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, oranges, and grapefruit. While not harmful to humans, canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat but too unsightly to be sold. The disease, which is believed to have originated in South East Asia, is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area, making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease. Australia, Brazil and the United States are currently suffering from canker outbreaks. The disease can be detected in orchards and on fruit by the appearance of lesions. Early detection is critical in quarantine situations. Bacteria are tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with the bacterium. Simultaneously, other diagnostic tests (antibody detection, fatty-acid profiling, and genetic procedures using PCR) are conducted to identify the particular canker strain. Citrus canker outbreaks are prevented and managed in a number of ways. In countries that do not have canker, the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures. In countries with new outbreaks, eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful; such programs rely on the destruction of affected orchards. When eradication has been unsuccessful and the disease has become established, management options include replacing susceptible citrus cultivars with resistant cultivars, applying preventive sprays of copper-based bactericides, and destroying infected trees and all surrounding trees within an appropriate radius. The citrus industry is the largest fresh-fruit exporting industry in Australia. Australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker; all three were successfully eradicated. The disease was found twice during the 1900s in the Northern Territory and was eradicated each time. During the first outbreak in 1912, every citrus tree north of latitude 19¬∞ south was destroyed, taking 11 years to eradicate the disease.Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. Exotic plant pests - citrus canker In 2004, Asiatic citrus canker was detected in an orchard in Emerald, Queensland, and was thought to have occurred from the illegal import of infected citrus plants. The state and federal governments have ordered that all commercial orchards, all non- commercial citrus trees, and all native lime trees (C. glauca) in the vicinity of Emerald be destroyed rather than trying to isolate infected trees. =Food security= The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines food security as existing when \\"all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\\".FAO (2008) An introduction to the basic concepts of food security. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy. The four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability, economic and physical access, appropriate utilization, and stability of the prior three elements over time. Of the 6.7 billion people on the planet, about 2 billion are food insecure. As the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050, and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption, food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure. Climate change presents additional threats to food security, affecting crop yields, distribution of pests and diseases, weather patterns, and growing seasons around the world. Food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change. The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change listed high-priority policy actions to address food security, including integrating food security and sustainable agriculture into global and national policies, significantly raising the level of global investment in food systems, and developing specific programs and policies to support the most vulnerable populations (namely, those that are already subject to food insecurity). =Food sovereignty= 'Food sovereignty', a term coined by members of Via Campesina in 1996,\\"Global Small-Scale Farmers' Movement Developing New Trade Regimes\\", Food First News & Views, Volume 28, Number 97 Spring/Summer 2005, p.2. is about the right of peoples to define their own food systems. Advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce, distribute, and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies, rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system. This movement is advocated by a number of farmers, peasants, pastoralists, fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, women, rural youth, and environmental organizations.  Policy tools  An agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers and agribusinesses to manage the agricultural industry as one part of the various methods a government uses in a mixed economy. The conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product, size of the farm, nature of ownership, and country among other factors. Enriching peanut farmers for political purposes, keeping the price of a staple low to keep the poor from rebelling, stabilizing the production of a crop to avoid famine years, encouraging diversification and many other purposes have been suggested as the reason for specific subsidies. Price floors or price ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product. Price controls encourage more production by a price floor or less production by a price ceiling. A government can erect trade barriers to limit the number of goods imported (in the case of a Quota Share) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products. These barriers give preference to domestic producers.  Objectives of market intervention  = National security = Some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption. Significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war, blockade or embargo. Maintaining adequate domestic capability allows for food self-sufficiency that lessens the risk of supply shocks due to geopolitical events. Agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share. This may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid. Or it may be an ongoing subsidy designed to allow a product to compete with or undercut the foreign competition. This may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports. It also helps to form the nation's supply and demand market. = Environmental protection and land management = Farm or undeveloped land composes the majority of land in most countries. Policies may encourage some land uses rather than others in the interest of protecting the environment. For instance, subsidies may be given for particular farming methods, forestation, land clearance, or pollution abatement. = Rural poverty and poverty relief = Subsidising farming may encourage people to remain on the land and obtain some income. This might be relevant to a third world country with many peasant farmers, but it may also be a consideration to more developed countries such as Poland. It has a very high unemployment rate, much farmland and retains a large rural population growing food for their own use. Price controls may also be used to assist poor citizens. Many countries have used this method of welfare support as it delivers cheap food to the poorest in urban areas without the need to assess people to give them financial aid. This often goes at the cost of the rural poor, who then earn less from what is often their only realistic or potential source of income: agriculture. Because in almost all countries the rural poor are poorer than the urban poor, cheap food policies through price controls often increase overall poverty. The same often counts for poverty relief in the form of food aid, which (unless while during severe drought) drives small producers in poor countries out of production. It tends to benefit lower middle class groups (sub-urban and urban poor) at the expense of the poorest 20 percent, who as a result remain deprived of customers. = Organic farming assistance = Welfare economics theory holds that sometimes private activities can impose social costs upon others. Industrial agriculture is widely considered to impose social costs through pesticide pollution and nitrate pollution. Further, agriculture uses large amounts of water, a scarce resource. Some economists argue that taxes should be levied on agriculture, or that organic agriculture, which uses little pesticides and experiences relatively little nitrate runoff, should be encouraged with subsidies. In the United States, 65% of the approximately $16.5 billion in annual subsidies went to the top 10% of farmers in 2002 because subsidies are linked to certain commodities.The Heritage Foundation (2004) The Heritage Foundation On the other hand, organic farming received $5 million for help in certification and $15 million for research over a 5-year time period. = Fair trade = Some advocate Fair Trade rules to ensure that poor farmers in developing nations that produce crops primarily for export are not exploited or negatively impacted by trade policies, practices, tariffs, and agreements which benefit one competitor at the expense of another - which advocates consider a dangerous \\"race to the bottom\\" in agricultural labor and safety standards. Opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations (agribusiness) which are hardly deserving of sympathy, and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty. Fair trade steak? Much of what developing countries export to the rich world, also comes from industrial corporations. The reason for that is, that rich countries have put up elaborate quality demands, most of whom make no factual health contribution. Small farmers often in effect meet these demands, but are rarely able to prove that in western standards. Therefore, the biggest impediment to the growth of small farming and therefore of fare trade in sectors beyond coffee and bananas, is these quality demands from the rich world.  Arguments against market intervention  = Dumping of agricultural surpluses= In international trade parlance, when a company from country A sells a commodity below the cost of production into country B, this is called \\"dumping\\". A number of countries that are signatories to multilateral trade agreements have provisions that prohibit this practice. When rich countries subsidize domestic production, the excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid. This process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies. In developing nations where these effects are most severe, small farmers could no longer afford basic inputs and were forced to sell their land. \\"Consider a farmer in Ghana who used to be able to make a living growing rice. Several years ago, Ghana was able to feed and export their surplus. Now, it imports rice. From where? Developed countries. Why? Because it's cheaper. Even if it costs the rice producer in the developed world much more to produce the rice, he doesn't have to make a profit from his crop. The government pays him to grow it, so he can sell it more cheaply to Ghana than the farmer in Ghana can. And that farmer in Ghana? He can't feed his family anymore.\\" (Lyle Vanclief, former Canadian Minister of Agriculture [1997-2003]) According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat and rice are sold below the cost of production, or dumped. Dumping rates are approximately forty percent for wheat, between twenty-five and thirty percent for corn (maize), approximately thirty percent for soybeans, fifty-seven percent for cotton, and approximately twenty percent for rice. For example, wheat is sold for forty percent below cost. According to Oxfam, \\"If developed nations eliminated subsidy programs, the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 %, plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium. ... exporters can offer US surpluses for sale at prices around half the cost of production; destroying local agriculture and creating a captive market in the process.\\" Free trade advocates desire the elimination of all market distorting mechanisms (subsidies, tariffs, regulations) and argue that, as with free trade in all areas, this will result in aggregate benefit for all. This position is particularly popular in competitive agricultural exporting nations in both the developed and developing world, some of whom have banded together in the Cairns Group lobby. Canada's Department of Agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about $4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved. = Agricultural independence = Many developing countries do not grow enough food to feed their own populations. These nations must buy food from other countries. Lower prices and free food save the lives of millions of starving people, despite the drop in food sales of the local farmers. A developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food, with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help. New greenhouse methods, hydroponics, fertilizers, R/O water processors, hybrid crops, fast-growing hybrid trees for quick shade, interior temperature control, greenhouse or tent insulation, autonomous building gardens, sun lamps, mylar, fans, and other cheap tech can be used to grow crops on previously unarable land, such as rocky, mountainous, desert, and even Arctic lands. More food can be grown, reducing dependency on other countries for food. Replacement crops can also make nations agriculturally independent. Sugar, for example, comes from sugar cane imported from Polynesia. Instead of buying the sugar from Polynesia, a nation can make sugar from sugar beets, maple sap, or sweetener from stevia plant, keeping the profits circulating within the nation's economy. Paper and clothes can be made of hemp instead of trees and cotton. Tropical foods won't grow in many places in Europe, but they will grow in insulated greenhouses or tents in Europe. Soybean plant cellulose can replace plastic (made from oil). Ethanol from farm waste or hempseed oil can replace gasoline. Rainforest medicine plants grown locally can replace many imported medicines. Alternates of cash crops, like sugar and oil replacements, can reduce farmers' dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations. Market interventions may increase the cost to consumers for agricultural products, either via hidden wealth- transfers via the government, or increased prices at the consumer level, such as for sugar and peanuts in the US. This has led to market distortions, such as food processors using high fructose corn syrup as a replacement for sugar. High fructose corn syrup may be an unhealthy food additive, and, were sugar prices not inflated by government fiat, sugar might be preferred over high fructose corn syrup in the marketplace.  Developed world cases  = Overview: Europe and America = The farmer population is approximately five percent of the total population in the E.U. and 1.7% in the U.S. The total value of agricultural production in the E.U. amounted to 128 billion euros (1998). About forty-nine percent of this amount was accounted for by political measures: 37 billion euros due to direct payments and 43 billion euros from consumers due to the artificially high price. Eighty percent of European farmers receive a direct payment of 5,000 euros or less, while 2.2% receive a direct payment above 50,000 euros, totaling forty percent of all direct subsidies. The average U.S. farmer receives $16,000 in annual subsidies. Two- thirds of farmers receive no direct payments. Of those that do, the average amount amongst the lowest paid eighty percent was $7000 from 1995-2003. Subsidies are a mix of tax reductions, direct cash payments and below-market prices on water and other inputs. Some claim that these aggregate figures are misleading because large agribusinesses, rather than individual farmers, receive a significant share of total subsidy spending. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies, providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 contains direct and countercyclical payments designed to limit the effects of low prices and yields. In the EU, ‚Ç¨54 billion of subsidies are paid every year. An increasing share of the subsidies is being decoupled from production and lumped into the Single Farm Payment. While this has diminished the distortions created by the Common Agricultural Policy, many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods, such as biodiversity and clean water, is needed. The next major reform is expected for 2014 when a new long-term EU budget is coming into effect. = Environmental programs = The U.S. Conservation Reserve Program leases land from producers that take marginal land out of production and convert it back to a near-natural state by planting native grasses and other plants. The U.S. Environmental Quality Incentives Program subsidizes improvements which promote water conservation and other measures. This program is conducted under a bidding process using a formula where farmers request a certain percentage of cost share for improvement such as drip irrigation. Producers that offer the most environmental improvement based on a point system for the least cost are funded first. The process continues until that year's allocated funds are expended.Financial Assistance, NRCS  World Trade Organization actions  In April 2004 the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that 3 billion dollars in US cotton subsidies violate trade agreements and that almost 50% of EU sugar exports are illegal. In 1997-2003, US cotton exports were subsidized by an average of 48%.The WTO has extracted commitments from the Philippines government, making it lower import barriers to half their present levels over a span of six years, and allowing in drastically increased competition from the industrialised and heavily subsidised farming systems of North America and Europe. A recent Oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30% over the six years as cheap imports from the US drive down prices in the local markets. The report estimates that in the absence of trade restrictions, US subsidised maize could be marketed at less than half the price of maize grown on the Philippine island of Mindanao; and that the livelihoods of up to half a million Filipino maize farmers (out of the total 1.2 million) are under immediate threat.

Agrarian politics Agricultural economics ","title":"Agricultural policy"},{"id":"171867","text":"Heraclides Ponticus ( Herakleides; c. 390 BC ‚Äì c. 310 BC) was a Greek philosopher and astronomer who was born in Heraclea Pontica, now Karadeniz Ereƒüli, Turkey, and migrated to Athens. He is best remembered for proposing that the Earth rotates on its axis, from west to east, once every 24 hours. He is also hailed as the originator of the heliocentric theory, although this is doubted by some. Life Heraclides' father was Euthyphron, a wealthy nobleman who sent his son to study at the Platonic Academy in Athens under its founder Plato and under his successor Speusippus. According to the Suda, Plato, on his departure for Sicily in 361/360 BC, left the Academy in the charge of Heraclides. Heraclides was nearly elected successor to Speusippus as head of the academy in 339/338 BC, but narrowly lost to Xenocrates. Work Like the Pythagoreans Hicetas and Ecphantus, Heraclides proposed that the apparent daily motion of the stars was created by the rotation of the Earth on its axis once a day. This view contradicted the accepted Aristotelian model of the universe, which said that the Earth was fixed and that the stars and planets in their respective spheres might also be fixed. Simplicius says that Heraclides proposed that the irregular movements of the planets can be explained if the Earth moves while the Sun stays still. Although some historians have proposed that Heraclides taught that Venus and Mercury revolve around the Sun, a detailed investigation of the sources has shown that \\"nowhere in the ancient literature mentioning Heraclides of Pontus is there a clear reference for his support for any kind of heliocentrical planetary position\\". A punning on his name, dubbing him Heraclides \\"Pompicus,\\" suggests he may have been a rather vain and pompous man and the target of much ridicule. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, Heraclides forged plays under the name of Thespis, this time drawing from a different source, Dionysius the Deserter, composed plays and forged them under the name of Sophocles. Heraclides was deceived by this easily and cited from them as the words of Aeschylus and Sophocles. However, Heraclides seems to have been a versatile and prolific writer on philosophy, mathematics, music, grammar, physics, history and rhetoric, notwithstanding doubts about attribution of many of the works. It appears that he composed various works in dialogue form. Heraclides also seems to have had an interest in the occult. In particular he focused on explaining trances, visions and prophecies in terms of the retribution of the gods, and reincarnation. A quote of Heraclides, of particular significance to historians, is his statement that fourth century B.C. Rome was a Greek city. Heraclides Ponticus refers with much admiration that Pythagoras would remember having been Pirro and before Euphorbus and before some other mortal. Excerpt from a speech by the character ‚ÄòHeraclides‚Äô in Protrepticus (Hutchinson and Johnson, 2015) :\\"So nothing divine or happy belongs to humans apart from just that one thing worth taking seriously, as much insight and intelligence as is in us, for, of what‚Äôs ours, this alone seems to be immortal, and this alone divine. And by being able to share in such a capacity, our way of life, although by nature miserable and difficult, is yet so gracefully managed that, in comparison with the other animals, a human seems to be a god.\\" (p. 43) Notes References   Further reading * Diogenes La√´rtius trans.

Career Robinson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. In his teens he worked as a pianist in theaters to provide music for silent movies. With a right arm that was damaged by polio, he formed unusual techniques with his left hand. With his brother John, a drummer, he toured the southern United States in the early 1910s with an extended stay in New Orleans. He started publishing compositions in his teens; his early hits included \\"Sapho Rag\\" and \\"Eccentric\\". His compositions were published as piano rolls by Imperial, the United Music Company, and QRS. He signed a contract with QRS to record blues songs from 1918 to 1921. He worked as a manager for the publishing company owned by W.C. Handy. Robinson became a member of the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1919, replacing on piano Henry Ragas, who died on February 18, 1919, in the flu epidemic. Aside from the band, in the early to middle 1920s he played piano for vocalists such as Lizzie Miles and Lucille Hegamin. In the 1930s he became the head of NBC Radio's music department and was a major factor in reuniting the now scattered band. The reunion in 1936 yielded six RCA Victor recordings as \\"The Original Dixieland Five,\\" several network radio appearances (one with Benny Goodman), and an appearance in a \\"March of Time\\" movie short, with J.

He was well known for his writings on Ancient Greek philosophy, especially Pre-Socratic Philosophy, and most of all for his celebrated, multi-volume historical treatise The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development (1844‚Äì52).Die Philosophie der Griechen in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung Zeller was also a central figure in the revival of neo-Kantianism. Life Eduard Zeller was born at Kleinbottwar in W√ºrttemberg, the son of a government official. He was educated first at the Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren starting in 1831, and later at the University of T√ºbingen (the T√ºbinger Stift), then much under the influence of Hegel. He received his doctorate in 1836 with a thesis on Plato's Laws. In 1840 he was Privatdozent of theology at T√ºbingen, in 1847 professor of theology at Berne, and in 1849 professor of theology at Marburg, where he soon shifted to the philosophy faculty as the result of disputes with the Clerical party. He became professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1862, moved to Berlin in 1872, and retired around 1895. He remained best known for his The Philosophy of Greeks in their Historical Development (1844‚Äì52). He continued to expand and improve this work to reflect new research, and the last edition appeared in 1902. It was translated into most European languages and became the standard textbook on Greek philosophy. Zeller also published many works on theology and three volumes of philosophical essays. He was also one of the founders of the Theologische Jahrb√ºcher (Theological Yearbooks), a periodical which became well known as the exponent of the historical method of David Strauss and Christian Baur. He wrote much on the debate about whether theology was a kind of science (Wissenschaft). Like most of his contemporaries, including Friedrich Theodor Vischer, he began with Hegelianism, but subsequently developed a system of his own. He felt the necessity of going back to Kant and critically reconsidering the epistemological problems which, he believed, Kant had only partially resolved. Philosophical work Nonetheless, his accomplishments in the history of philosophy were far more influential than his contributions as an original thinker. Zeller's conception of the history of Greek thought was influenced by the dialectical philosophy of Hegel. Some critics maintain that Zeller was not alive enough to cultural context and to the idiosyncrasies of individual thinkers. Some hold that he laid too much stress upon Hegel's notion of \\"concept\\", and relied too much on the Hegelian antithesis of subject and object, though his history of Greek philosophy was nonetheless influential and highly regarded. He received the highest recognition, not only from philosophers and learned societies all over the world, but also from the German emperor and German people. In 1894 the Emperor Wilhelm II made him a \\"Wirklicher Geheimrat\\" with the title of \\"Excellenz,\\" and his bust, along with that of Helmholtz, was set up at the Brandenburg Gate near the statues erected to the Emperor and Empress Frederick. The Philosophie der Griechen has been translated into English by S. F. Alleyne (2 vols, 1881) in sections: S. F. Alleyne, History of Greek Philosophy to the time of Socrates (1881) Volume 1 and Volume 2; O. J. Reichel, Socrates and the Socratic Schools (1868; 2nd ed. 1877; 3rd ed. 1885); S. F. Alleyne and A.

Reichel, Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics (1870 and 1880); S. F. Alleyne, History of Eclecticism in Greek Philosophy (1883). Zeller was also, in his Philosophie der Griechen, one of the first to use the word 'Superhuman' (√ºbermensch), later central in Nietzsche and the propaganda of the Nazi Party, in adjectival form as a technical term in philosophy. He said \\"... thus the happiness in her can be designated superhuman (√ºbermenschliche) while in contrast the happiness flowing from ethical virtues is merely a characteristic human good.'\\"...so kann die Gl√ºckseligkeit, welche in ihr besteht, auch als eine √ºbermenschliche, die Gl√ºckseligkeit der ethischen Tugend dagegen als das eigenth√ºmlich menschliche Gut bezeichnet werden.\\"  Works  The Philosophie appeared in an abbreviated form as Grundriss der Geschichte der Griechischen Philosophie (1883; 5th ed. 1898); English transl. by Alleyne and Evelyn Abbott (1886), under the title, Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophy.

Listed as Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance (admin.ch ). A family farm is generally understood to be a farm owned and/or operated by a family; it is sometimes considered to be an estate passed down by inheritance. Family farm businesses can take many forms, from smallholding farms to larger farms operated under intensive farming practices. In some geographies, most farm families have structured their farm businesses as corporations, limited liability corporations, and trusts, for liability, tax, and business purposes. In the United States for example, a 2014 USDA report shows that family farms operate 90 percent of the nation‚Äôs farmland, and account for 85 percent of the country‚Äôs agricultural production value. The concept or definition does not easily translate across languages or cultures, as there are substantial differences in the agricultural traditions and histories between countries. Thus, in the United States, a family farm can be of any size, while in Brazil, the official definition of a family farm (agricultura familiar) is limited to small farms worked primarily by members of a single family.Farms are those that employ mostly family members, with a maximum of five additional temporary workers. Farms that would not be considered family farms would be those operated as collectives, non-family corporations, or in other institutionalised forms. At least 500 million of the world's [estimated] 570 million farms are managed by families, making family farms predominant in global agriculture.http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/260535/icode/Lowder, S.

Definitions referred to one or more of labor, management, size, provision of family livelihood, residence, family ties and generational aspects, community and social networks, subsistence orientation, patrimony, land ownership and family investment.Garner, E. and A. P. de la O Campos. 2014. Identifying the \\"family farm\\" ‚Äì An informal discussion of the concepts and definitions. ESA Working Paper 14-10. FAO, Rome. http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4306e.pdf The disparity of definitions reflects national and geographical differences in cultures, rural land tenure, and rural economies, as well as the different purposes for which definitions are coined. The 2012 United States Census of Agriculture defines a family farm as \\"any farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals related to the operator, including relatives who do not live in the operator‚Äôs household\\"; it defines a farm as \\"any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during a given year.\\"United States Department of Agriculture. 2015. 2012 Census of Agriculture. Farm typology. Vol. 2. Subject series. Part 10. AC-12-S-10. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines a \\"family farm\\" as one that relies primarily on family members for labour and management.http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/207544/icode In some usages, \\"family farm\\" implies that the farm remains within the ownership of a family over a number of generations.Bj√∏rhaug, H. and A. Blekesaune. 2008. Gender and work in Norwegian family farms. Sociologia ruralis 48: 152‚Äì65. Being special- purpose definitions, the definitions found in laws or regulations may differ substantially from commonly understood meanings of \\"family farm\\". For example, In the United States, under federal Farm Ownership loan regulations, the definition of a \\"family farm\\" does not specify the nature of farm ownership, and management of the farm is either by the borrower, or by members operating the farm when a loan is made to a corporation, co-operative or other entity. The complete definition can be found in the US Code of Federal Regulations 7 CFR 1943.4. History Dispersed settlement landscape in Carinthia. Mountain farms in South Tyrol. In the Roman Republic, latifundia, great landed estates, specialised in agriculture destined for export, producing grain, olive oil, or wine, corresponding largely to modern industrialized agriculture but depending on slave labour instead of mechanization, developed after the Second Punic War and increasingly replaced the former system of family-owned small or intermediate farms in the Roman Empire period. The basis of the latifundia in Spain and Sicily was the ager publicus that fell to the dispensation of the state through Rome's policy of war in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD. In the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the largely self-sufficient villa-system of the latifundia remained among the few political-cultural centres of a fragmented Europe. These latifundia had been of great importance economically, until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil, grain and garum disintegrated, but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted power: it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the European social feudal system, taking the form of Manorialism, the essential element of feudal society,\\"Feudal Society\\", in its modern sense was coined in Marc Bloch's 1939‚Äì40 books of the same name. Bloch (Feudal Society, tr. L.A. Masnyon, 1965, vol. II, p. 442) emphasised the distinction between economic manorialism which preceded feudalism and survived it, and political and social feudalism, or seigneurialism. and the organizing principle of rural economy in medieval Europe.Peter Sarris, \\"The Origins of the Manorial Economy: New Insights from Late Antiquity\\", The English Historical Review 119 (April 2004:279‚Äì311). Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. Manorialism died slowly and piecemeal, along with its most vivid feature in the landscape, the open field system. It outlasted serfdom as it outlasted feudalism: \\"primarily an economic organization, it could maintain a warrior, but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord. It could be self- sufficient, yield produce for the market, or it could yield a money rent.\\"Andrew Jones, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Critical Comment\\" The Journal of Economic History 32.4 (December 1972:938‚Äì944) p. 938; a comment on D. North and R. Thomas, \\"The rise and fall of the manorial system: a theoretical model\\", The Journal of Economic History 31 (December 1971:777‚Äì803). The last feudal dues in France were abolished at the French Revolution. In parts of eastern Germany, the Rittergut manors of Junkers remained until World War II.Hartwin Spenkuch, \\"Herrenhaus und Rittergut: Die Erste Kammer des Landtags und der preu√üische Adel von 1854 bis 1918 aus sozialgeschichtlicher Sicht\\" Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 25.3 (July ‚Äì September 1999):375‚Äì403). The common law of the leasehold estate relation evolved in medieval England. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order. Under the tenant system, a farm may be worked by the same family over many generations, but what is inherited is not the farm's estate itself but the lease on the estate. In much of Europe, serfdom was abolished only in the modern period, in Western Europe after the French Revolution, in Russia as late as in 1861. In contrast to the Roman system of latifundia and the derived system of manoralism, the Germanic peoples had a system based on heritable estates owned by individual families or clans. The Germanic term for \\"heritable estate, allodium\\" was *≈ç√æalan (Old English ƒì√æel), which incidentally was also used as a rune name; the gnomic verse on this term in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem reads: :[ƒí√∞el] by√æ oferleof √¶ghwylcum men, gif he mot √∞√¶r rihtes and gerysena on brucan on bolde bleadum oftast. :\\"[An estate] is very dear to every man, if he can enjoy there in his house whatever is right and proper in constant prosperity.\\" In the inheritance system known as Salic patrimony (also gavelkind in its exceptional survival in medieval Kent) refers to this clan-based possession of real estate property, particularly in Germanic context. Terra salica could not be sold or otherwise disposed; it was not alienable. Much of Germanic Europe has a history of overlap or conflict between the feudal system of manoralism, where the estate is owned by noblemen and leased to the tenants or worked by serfs, and the Germanic system of free farmers working landed estates heritable within their clan or family. Historical prevalence of the Germanic system of independent estates or H√∂fe resulted in dispersed settlement (Streusiedlung) structure, as opposed to the village-centered settlements of manoralism. Mention of \\"hofe\\" in Beowulf In German-speaking Europe, farming estates are known as Hof; this German word notably has the meaning of both \\"farming estate\\" and \\"royal court\\", in origin referring to the building or hall at the center of any independent estate. The recharacterized compound Bauernhof was formed in the early modern period to designate family farming estates, while Meierhof designated a manorial estate, and the unmarked term Hof was increasingly used for the royal or noble court.Johann Christoph Adelung, Grammatisch-kritisches W√∂rterbuch (1774). The estate as a whole is referred to by the collective Geh√∂ft (15th century); the corresponding Slavic concept being Khutor. H√∂feordnung is the German legal term for the inheritance laws regarding family farms, deriving from inheritance under medieval Saxon law. In England, the title of yeoman was applied to such land-owning commoners from the 15th century. In the early modern and modern period, the dissolution of manoralism went parallel to the development of intensive farming parallel to the Industrial Revolution. Mechanization enabled the cultivation of much larger areas than what was typical for the traditional estates aimed at subsistence farming, resulting in the emergence of a smaller number of large farms, with the displaced population partly contributing to the new class of industrial wage-labourers and partly emigrating to the New World or the Russian Empire (following the 1861 emancipation of the serfs). The family farms established in Imperial Russia were again collectivized under the Soviet Union, but the emigration of European farmers displaced by the Industrial Revolution contributed to the emergence of a system of family estates in the Americas (Homestead Act of 1862). Thomas Jefferson's argument that a large number of family estates are a factor in ensuring the stability of democracy was repeatedly used in support of subsidies.E. Wesley F. Peterson: A Billion Dollars a Day: The Economics and Politics of Agricultural Subsidies. Wiley- Blackwell, 2009, 127s. Developed world =Perceptions of the family farm= In developed countries the family farm is viewed sentimentally, as a lifestyle to be preserved for tradition's sake, or as a birthright. It is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy, most commonly in France, Japan, and the United States, where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable. In these countries, strange bedfellows can often be found arguing for similar measures despite otherwise vast differences in political ideology. For example, Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader, both candidates for the office of President of the United States, held rural rallies together and spoke for measures to preserve the so- called family farm. On other economic matters they were seen as generally opposed, but found common ground on this one. The social roles of family farms are much changed today. Until recently, staying in line with traditional and conservative sociology, the heads of the household were usually the oldest man followed closely by his oldest sons. The wife generally took care of the housework, child rearing, and financial matters pertaining to the farm. However, agricultural activities have taken on many forms and change over time. Agronomy, horticulture, aquaculture, silviculture, and apiculture, along with traditional plants and animals, all make up aspects of today's family farm. Farm wives often need to find work away from the farm to supplement farm income and children sometimes have no interest in farming as their chosen field of work. Bolder promoters argue that as agriculture has become more efficient with the application of modern management and new technologies in each generation, the idealized classic family farm is now simply obsolete, or more often, unable to compete without the economies of scale available to larger and more modern farms. Advocates argue that family farms in all nations need to be protected, as the basis of rural society and social stability. =Viability= According to the United States Department of Agriculture, ninety-eight percent of all farms in the U.S. are family farms. Two percent of farms are not family farms, and those two percent make up fourteen percent of total agricultural output in the United States, although half of them have total sales of less than $50,000 per year. Overall, ninety-one percent of farms in the United States are considered \\"small family farms\\" (with sales of less than $250,000 per year), and those farms produce twenty-seven percent of U.S. agricultural output.USDA's \\"U.S. Farms: Numbers, Size, and Ownership\\" Depending on the type and size of independently owned operation, some limiting factors are: * Economies of scale: Larger farms are able to bargain more competitively, purchase more competitively, profit from economic highs, and weather lows more readily through monetary inertia than smaller farms. * Cost of inputs: fertilizer and other agrichemicals can fluctuate dramatically from season to season, partially based on oil prices, a range of 25% to 200% is common over a few year period. * oil prices: Directly (for farm machinery) and somewhat less directly (long distance transport; production cost of agrichemicals), the cost of oil significantly impacts the year-to-year viability of all mechanized conventional farms. * commodity futures: the predicted price of commodity crops, hogs, grain, etc., can determine ahead of a season what seems economically viable to grow. * technology user agreements: a less publicly known factor, patented GE seed that is widely used for many crops, like cotton and soy, comes with restrictions on use, which can even include who the crop can be sold to. * wholesale infrastructure: A farmer growing larger quantities of a crop than can be sold directly to consumers has to meet a range of criteria for sale into the wholesale market, which include harvest timing and graded quality, and may also include variety, therefore, the market channel really determines most aspects of the farm decisionmaking. * availability of financing: Larger farms today often rely on lines of credit, typically from banks, to purchase the agrichemicals, and other supplies needed for each growing year. These lines are heavily affected by almost all of the other constraining factors. * government economic intervention: In some countries, notably the US and EU, government subsidies to farmers, intended to mitigate the impact on domestic farmers of economic and political activities in other areas of the economy, can be a significant source of farm income. Bailouts, when crises such as drought or the \\"mad cow disease\\" problems hit agricultural sectors, are also relied on. To some large degree, this situation is a result of the large-scale global markets farms have no alternative but to participate in. * government and industry regulation: A wide range of quotas, marketing boards and legislation governing agriculture impose complicated limits, and often require significant resources to navigate. For example, on the small farming end, in many jurisdictions, there are severe limits or prohibitions on the sale of livestock, dairy and eggs. These have arisen from pressures from all sides: food safety, environmental, industry marketing. * real estate prices: The growth of urban centers around the world, and the resulting urban sprawl have caused the price of centrally located farmland to skyrocket, while reducing the local infrastructure necessary to support farming, putting effectively intense pressure on many farmers to sell out. Over the 20th century, the people of developed nations have collectively taken most of the steps down the path to this situation. Individual farmers opted for successive waves of new technology, happily \\"trading in their horses for a tractor\\", increasing their debt and their production capacity. This in turn required larger, more distant markets, and heavier and more complex financing. The public willingly purchased increasingly commoditized, processed, shipped and relatively inexpensive food. The availability of an increasingly diverse supply of fresh, uncured, unpreserved produce and meat in all seasons of the year (oranges in January, freshly killed steers in July, fresh pork rather than salted, smoked, or potassium-impregnated ham) opened an entirely new cuisine and an unprecedented healthy diet to millions of consumers who had never enjoyed such produce before. These abilities also brought to market an unprecedented variety of processed foods, such as corn syrup and bleached flour. For the family farm this new technology and increasingly complex marketing strategy has presented new and unprecedented challenges, and not all family farmers have been able to effectively cope with the changing market conditions. Intensive wheat farming in western North Dakota.according to uploader: a 2007 photograph of a \\"family-owned wheat planting rig\\" (Case STX Steiger tractor with Case IH seed drill combination). =Local food and the organic movement= In the last few decades there has been a resurgence of interest in organic and free range foods. A percentage of consumers have begun to question the viability of industrial agriculture practices and have turned to organic groceries that sell products produced on family farms including not only meat and produce but also such things as wheat germ breads and natural lye soaps (as opposed to bleached white breads and petroleum based detergent bars). Others buy these products direct from family farms. The \\"new family farm\\" provides an alternative market in some localities with an array of traditionally and naturally produced products. Such \\"organic\\" and \\"free-range\\" farming is attainable where a significant number of affluent urban and suburban consumers willingly pay a premium for the ideals of \\"locally produced produce\\" and \\"humane treatment of animals\\". Sometimes, these farms are hobby or part-time ventures, or supported by wealth from other sources. Viable farms on a scale sufficient to support modern families at an income level commensurate with urban and suburban upper-middle-class families are often large scale operations, both in area and capital requirements. These farms, family owned and operated in a technologically and economically conventional manner, produce crops and animal products oriented to national and international markets, rather than to local markets. In assessing this complex economic situation, it is important to consider all sources of income available to these farms; for instance, the millions of dollars in farm subsidies which the United States government offers each year. As fuel prices rise, foods shipped to national and international markets are already rising in price. =United States= In 2012, the United States had 2,039,093 family farms (as defined by USDA), accounting for 97 percent of all farms and 89 percent of census farm area in the United States.United States Department of Agriculture. 2014. 2012 Census of agriculture. United States summary and state data. Volume 1. Geographic area series. Part 51 AC-12-A-51. In 1988 Mark Friedberger warned, \\"The farm family is a unique institution, perhaps the last remnant, in an increasingly complex world, of a simpler social order in which economic and domestic activities were inextricably bound together. In the past few years, however, American agriculture has suffered huge losses, and family farmers have seen their way of life threatened by economic forces beyond their control.\\" See Mark Friedberger, Farm Families and Change in 20th-Century America However by 1981 Ingolf Vogeler argued it was too late--the American family farm had been replaced by large agribusiness corporations pretending to be family operated. Ingolf Vogeler, The myth of the family farm: Agribusiness dominance of US agriculture (1981) excerpt. A USDA survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of US farm production and 85 percent of US gross farm income. Mid-size and larger family farms account for 60 percent of US farm production and dominate US production of cotton, cash grain and hogs. Small family farms account for 26 percent of US farm production overall, and higher percentages of production of poultry, beef cattle, some other livestock and hay.Hoppe, R.A. 2014. Structure and finances of U.S. farms: family farm report, 2014 edition. United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service EIB-132. Several kinds of US family farms are recognized in USDA farm typology: Small family farms are defined as those with annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) of less than $350,000; in 2011, these accounted for 90 percent of all US farms. Because low net farm incomes tend to predominate on such farms, most farm families on small family farms are extremely dependent on off-farm income. Small family farms in which the principal operator was mostly employed off-farm accounted for 42 percent of all farms and 15 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $788. Retirement family farms were small farms accounting for 16 percent of all farms and 7 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income was $5,002. The other small family farm categories are those in which farming occupies at least 50 percent of the principal operator‚Äôs working time. These are: Low-sales small family farms (with GCFI less than $150,000); 26 percent of all US farms, 18 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $3,579. Moderate-sales small family farms (with GCFI of $150,000 to $349,999); 5.44 percent of all US farms, 13 percent of total US farm area, median net farm income $67,986. Mid-size family farms (GCFI of $350,000 to $999,999); 6 percent of all US farms, 22 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $154,538. Large family farms (GCFI $1,000,000 to $4,999,999); 2 percent of all US farms, 14 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $476,234. Very large family farms (GCFI over $5,000,000); <1 percent of all US farms, 2 percent of total US farm area; median net farm income $1,910,454.Hoppe, R.A. 2014. Structure and finances of U.S. farms: family farm report, 2014 edition. United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service EIB-132. Family farms include not only sole proprietorships and family partnerships, but also family corporations. Family-owned corporations account for 5 percent of all farms and 89 percent of corporate farms in the United States. About 98 percent of US family corporations owning farms are small, with no more than 10 shareholders; average net farm income of family corporate farms was $189,400 in 2012. (In contrast, 90 percent of US non-family corporations owning farms are small, having no more than 10 shareholders; average net cash farm income for US non-family corporate farms was $270,670 in 2012.) =Canada= In Canada, the number of \\"family farms\\" cannot be inferred closely, because of the nature of census data, which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships. In 2011, of Canada‚Äôs 205,730 farms, 55 percent were sole proprietorships, 25 percent were partnerships, 17 percent were family corporations, 2 percent were non-family corporations and <1 percent were other categories.Statistics Canada. 2011 Census of Agriculture. Because some but not all partnerships involve family members, these data suggest that family farms account for between about 73 and 97 percent of Canadian farms. The family farm percentage is likely to be near the high end of this range, for two reasons. The partners in a [Canadian] farm partnership are typically spouses, often forming the farm partnership for tax reasons.Family farm partnerships. http://www.mnp.ca/en/media- centre/library/2010/10/1/family-farm-partnerships Also, as in the US, family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring. Conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation may also be influenced by legal and financial, e.g. tax, considerations. The Canadian Encyclopedia estimates that more than 90 percent of Canadian farms are family operations.Canadian Encyclopedia. Farm law. http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/farm-law/ In 2006, of Canadian farms with more than one million dollars in annual gross farm receipts, about 63 percent were family corporations and 13 percent were non- family corporations.Statistics Canada.

Permanent farming estates were established during colonialism, in the 19th to 20th century.

International Year of Family Farming  Logo of International Year of Family Farming 2014 At the 66th session of the United Nations General Assembly, 2014 was formally declared to be the \\"International Year of Family Farming\\" (IYFF). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was invited to facilitate its implementation, in collaboration with Governments, International Development Agencies, farmers' organizations and other relevant organizations of the United Nations system as well as relevant non- governmental organizations. The goal of the 2014 IYFF is to reposition family farming at the centre of agricultural, environmental and social policies in the national agendas by identifying gaps and opportunities to promote a shift towards a more equal and balanced development. The 2014 IYFF will promote broad discussion and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by smallholders and help identify efficient ways to support family farmers.

There is a wide variety of native trees, adapted to all the various micro-climates in New Zealand. The native bush (forest) ranges from the subtropical kauri forests of the northern North Island, temperate rainforests of the West Coast, the alpine forests of the Southern Alps and Fiordland to the coastal forests of the Abel Tasman National Park and the Catlins. In the early period of British colonisation, many New Zealand trees were known by names derived from the names of unrelated European trees, but more recently the trend has been to adopt the native MƒÅori language names into English.

the genus Agathis, found north of 38¬∞S in the northern districts of New Zealand's North Island. Overview It is the largest (by volume) but not tallest species of tree in New Zealand, standing up to 50 m tall in the emergent layer above the forest's main canopy. The tree has smooth bark and small narrow leaves. Other common names to distinguish A. australis from other members of the genus are southern kauri and New Zealand kauri. Kauri forests are among the most ancient in the world. The antecedents of the kauri appeared during the Jurassic period (between 190 and 135 million years ago). Although the kauri is among the most ancient trees in the world, it has developed a unique niche in the forest. With its novel soil interaction and regeneration pattern it can compete with the more recently evolved and faster growing angiosperms. Because it is such a conspicuous species, forest containing kauri is generally known as kauri forest, although kauri need not be the most abundant tree. In the warmer northern climate, kauri forests have a higher species richness than those found further south. Kauri even act as a foundation species that modify the soil under their canopy to create unique plant communities. Description Foliage on a young tree. The foliage of older trees is usually unreachable. The young plant grows straight upwards and has the form of a narrow cone with branches going out along the length of the trunk. However, as it gains in height, the lowest branches are shed, preventing vines from climbing. By maturity, the top branches form an imposing crown that stands out over all other native trees, dominating the forest canopy. The flaking bark of the kauri tree defends it from parasitic plants, and accumulates around the base of the trunk. On large trees it may pile up to a height of 2 m or more.Reed, p.60 The kauri has a habit of forming small clumps or patches scattered through mixed forests.Reed, p.74 Kauri leaves are 3 to 7 cm long and 1 cm broad, tough and leathery in texture, with no midrib; they are arranged in opposite pairs or whorls of three on the stem. The seed cones are globose, 5 to 7 cm diameter, and mature 18 to 20 months after pollination; the seed cones disintegrate at maturity to release winged seeds, which are then dispersed by the wind. A single tree produces both male and female seed cones. Fertilisation of the seeds occurs by pollination, which may be driven by the same or another tree's pollen. =Size= Agathis australis can attain heights of 40 to 50 metres and trunk diameters big enough to rival Californian sequoias at over 5 metres. The largest kauri trees did not attain as much height or girth at ground level but contain more timber in their cylindrical trunks than comparable Sequoias with their tapering stems. The largest recorded specimen was known as The Great Ghost and grew in the mountains at the head of the Tararu Creek, which drains into the Hauraki Gulf just north of the mouth of the Waihou River (Thames). Thames Historian Alastair Isdale says the tree was 8.54 metres in diameter, and 26.83 metres in girth. It was consumed by fire c.1890. A kauri tree at Mill Creek, Mercury Bay, known as Father of the Forests was measured in the early 1840s as 22 metres in circumference and 24 metres to the first branches. It was recorded as being killed by lightning in that period.Reed, p.89-92 Another huge tree, Kairaru, had a girth of 20.1 metres and a columnar trunk free of branches for 30.5 metres as measured by a Crown Lands ranger, Henry Wilson, in 1860. It was on a spur of Mt Tutamoe about 30 km south of Waipoua Forest near Kaihau. It was destroyed in the 1880s or 1890s when a series of huge fires swept the area.These and other giant trees, along with their demise through the second half of the 19th century, are recorded in Huchins, D. E. (1919), New Zealand Forestry, published by the New Zealand Forest Service and available online through Google Books. Other trees far larger than living kauri have been noted in other areas. Rumors of stumps up to 6 metres are sometimes suggested in areas such as the Billygoat Track above the Kauaeranga Valley near Thames. However, there is no good evidence for these (e.g., a documented measurement or a photograph with a person for scale). Given that over 90 per cent of the area of kauri forest standing before 1000AD was destroyed by about 1900, it is not surprising that recent records are of smaller, but still very large trees. Two large kauri fell during tropical storms in the 1970s. One of these was Toronui, in Waipoua Forest. Its diameter was larger than that of Tane Mahuta and its clean bole larger than that of Te Matua Ngahere, and by forestry measurements was the largest standing. Another tree, Kopi, in Omahuta Forest near the standing Hokianga kauri, was the third largest with a height of 56.39 metres (185') and a diameter of 4.19 metres (13.75'). It fell in 1973. Like many ancient kauri both trees were partly hollow. Growth rate and age In general over the lifetime of the tree the growth rate tends to increase, reach a maximum, then decline.Reed p.62 A 1987 study measured mean annual diameter increments ranging from 1.5 to 4.6 mm per year with an overall average of 2.3 mm per year. This is equivalent to 8.7 annual rings per centimetre of core, said to be half the commonly quoted figure for growth rate. The same study found only a weak relationship between age and diameter. The growth of kauri in planted and second-growth natural forests has been reviewed and compared during the development of growth and yield models for the species. Kauri in planted forests were found to have up to 12 times the volume productivity than those in natural stands at the same age. Individuals in the same 10 cm diameter class may vary in age by 300 years, and the largest individual on any particular site is often not the oldest.Reed p.61-63 Trees can normally live longer than 600 years. Many individuals probably exceed 1000 years, but there is no conclusive evidence that trees can exceed 2000 years in age. By combining tree ring samples from living kauri, wooden buildings, and preserved swamp wood, a dendrochronology has been created which reaches back 4,500 years, the longest tree ring record of past climate change in the southern hemisphere. Root structure and soil interaction One of the defining aspects of the kauri tree's unique ecological niche is its relationship with the soil below. Much like podocarps, it feeds in the organic litter near the surface of the soil through fine root hairs. This layer of the soil is composed of organic matter derived from falling leaves and branches as well as dead trees, and is constantly undergoing decomposition. On the other hand, broadleaf trees such as mƒÅhoe derive a good fraction of their nutrition in the deeper mineral layer of the soil. Although its feeding root system is very shallow, it also has several downwardly directed peg roots which anchor it firmly in the soil. Such a solid foundation is necessary to prevent a tree the size of a kauri from blowing over in storms and cyclones. The litter left by kauri is much more acidic than most trees, and as it decays similarly acidic compounds are liberated. In a process known as leaching, these acidic molecules pass through the soil layers with the help of rainfall, and release other nutrients trapped in clay such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This leaves these important nutrients unavailable to other trees, as they are washed down into deeper layers. This process is known as podsolization, and changes the soil colour to a dull grey. For a single tree, this leaves an area of leached soil beneath known as a cup podsol. This leaching process is important for kauri's survival as it competes with other species for space. Leaf litter and other decaying parts of a kauri decompose much more slowly than those of most other species. Besides its acidity, the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols, most notably tannins, that are harmful to microorganisms. This results in a large buildup of litter around the base of a mature tree in which its own roots feed. As with most perennials, these feeding roots also house a symbiotic fungi known as mycorrhiza which increase the plant's efficiency in taking up nutrients. In this mutualistic relationship, the fungus derives its own nutrition from the roots. In its interactions with the soil, kauri is thus able to starve its competitors of much needed nutrients and compete with much younger lineages. Distribution =Local spatial distribution= A kauri at Waipoua Forest In terms of local topography, kauri is far from randomly dispersed. As mentioned above, kauri relies on depriving its competitors of nutrition in order to survive. However, one important consideration not discussed thus far is the slope of the land. Water on hills flows downward by the action of gravity, taking with it the nutrients in the soil. This results in a gradient from nutrient poor soil at the top of slopes to nutrient rich soils below. As nutrients leached are replaced by aqueous nitrates and phosphates from above, the kauri tree is less able to inhibit the growth of strong competitors such as angiosperms. In contrast, the leaching process is only enhanced on higher elevation. In Waipoua Forest this is reflected in higher abundances of kauri on ridge crests, and greater concentrations of its main competitors, such as taraire are found at low elevations. This pattern is known as niche partitioning, and allows more than one species to occupy the same area. Those species which live alongside kauri include tawari, a montane broadleaf tree which is normally found in higher altitudes, where nutrient cycling is naturally slow. =Changes over recent geological time= Kauri is found growing in its natural ecosystem north of 38¬∞S latitude. Its southern limit stretches from the Kawhia Harbour in the west to the eastern Kaimai Range. However, its distribution has changed greatly over geological time because of climate change. This is shown in the recent Holocene epoch by its migration southwards after the peak of the last ice age. During this time when frozen ice sheets covered much of the world's continents, kauri was able to survive only in isolated pockets, its main refuge being in the very far north. Radiocarbon dating is one technique used by scientists to uncover the history of the tree's distribution, with stump kauri from peat swamps used for measurement. The coldest period in recent times occurred about 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, when time kauri was apparently confined north of Kaitaia, near the northernmost point of the North Island, North Cape. Kauri requires a mean temperature of 17 ¬∞C or more for most of the year. The tree's retreat can be used as a proxy for temperature changes during this period. It remains unclear whether kauri recolonised the North Island from a single refuge in the far north or from scattered pockets of isolated stands that managed to survive despite climatic conditions. It spread south through WhangƒÅrei, past Dargaville and as far south as Waikato, attaining its peak distribution during the years 3000 BP to 2000 BP. There is some suggestion it has receded somewhat since then, which may indicate temperatures have declined slightly. During the peak of its movement southwards, it was traveling as fast as 200 metres per year. Its southward spread seems relatively rapid for a tree that can take a millennium to reach complete maturity. This can be explained by its life history pattern. Kauri relies on wind for pollination and seed dispersal, while many other natives have their seeds carried large distances by frugivores (animals which eat fruit) such as the kerer≈´ (native pigeon). However, kauri trees can produce seeds while relatively young, taking only 50 years or so before giving rise to their own offspring. This trait makes them somewhat like a pioneer species, despite the fact that their long lifespan is characteristic of K-selected species. In good conditions, where access to water and sunlight are above average, diameters in excess of 15 centimetres and seed production can occur inside 15 years. Regeneration and life history Female cone of Agathis australis, Auckland, New Zealand Just as the niche of kauri is differentiated through its interactions with the soil, it also has a separate regeneration 'strategy' compared to its broadleaf neighbours. The relationship is very similar to the podocarp-broadleaf forests further south; kauri is much more light demanding and requires larger gaps to regenerate, whereas broadleaf trees such as puriri and kohekohe show far more shade tolerance. These species can regenerate in areas where lower levels of light reach ground level, for example from a single branch falling off. Kauri trees must therefore remain alive long enough for a large disturbance to occur, allowing them sufficient light to regenerate. In areas where large amounts of forest are destroyed, such as by logging, kauri seedlings are able to regenerate much more easily due not only to increased sunlight, but their stronger resistance to wind and frosts. Kauri occupy the emergent layer of the forest, where they are exposed to the effects of the weather; however, the smaller trees that dominate the main canopy are sheltered both by the emergent trees above and by each other. Left in open areas without protection they are far less capable of regenerating. When there is a disturbance severe enough to favour its regeneration, kauri trees regenerate en masse, producing a generation of trees of similar age after each disturbance. The distribution of kauri allows researchers to deduce when and where disturbances have occurred, and how large they may have been; the presence of abundant kauri may indicate that an area is prone to disturbance. Kauri seedlings still occur in areas with low light, of course, but mortality rates for such seedlings are much higher, and those that survive self-thinning and grow to sapling stage tend to be found in higher light environments. During periods with less disturbance kauri tends to lose ground to broadleaf competitors which can better tolerate shaded environments. In the complete absence of disturbance, kauri tends to become rare as it is excluded by its competitors. Kauri biomass tends to decrease during such times, as more biomass becomes concentrated in angiosperm species like towai. Kauri trees also tend to become more randomly distributed in age, with each tree dying at a different point in time, and regeneration gaps becoming rare and sporadic. Over thousands of years these varying regeneration strategies produce a tug of war effect where kauri retreats uphill during periods of calm, then takes over lower areas briefly during mass disturbances. Although such trends cannot be observed in a human lifetime, research into current patterns of distribution, behavior of species in experimental conditions, and study of pollen sediments (see palynology) have helped shed light on the life history of kauri. Kauri seeds may generally be taken from mature cones in late March. Each scale on a cone contains a single winged seed approximately 5 mm by 8 mm and attached to a thin wing perhaps half as large again. The cone is fully open and dispersed within only two to three days of starting. The tree has been shown to develop root grafts through which it shares water and nutrients with neighbours of the same species. Ethnobotany =Deforestation= The Siamese Kauri grows on the Coromandel Peninsula Heavy logging, which began around 1820 and continued for a century, has considerably decreased the number of kauri trees.King p.125 It has been estimated that before 1840, the kauri forests of northern New Zealand occupied at least 12,000 square kilometres. The British Royal Navy sent four vessels, HMS Coromandel (1821), HMS Dromedery (1821), (1840), and HMS Tortoise (1841) to gather kauri-wood spars. By 1900, less than 10 per cent of the original kauri survived. By the 1950s this area had decreased to about 1,400 square kilometres in 47 forests depleted of their best kauri. It is estimated that today, there is 4 per cent of uncut forest left in small pockets. Estimates are that around half of the timber was accidentally or deliberately burnt. More than half of the remainder had been exported to Australia, Britain, and other countries, while the balance was used locally to build houses and ships. Much of the timber was sold for a return sufficient only to cover wages and expenses. From 1871 to 1895 the receipts indicate a rate of about 8 shillings (around NZ$20 in 2003) per 100 superficial feet (34 shillings/m3).Reed p.74-75 The Government continued to sell large areas of kauri forests to sawmillers who, under no restrictions, took the most effective and economical steps to secure the timber, resulting in much waste and destruction. At a sale in 1908 more than 5,000 standing kauri trees, totalling about 20,000,000 superficial feet (47,000 m3), were sold for less than ¬£2 per tree (¬£2 in 1908 equates to around NZ$100 in 2003).Reed p.267 It is said that in 1890 the royalty on standing timber fell in some cases to as low as twopence (NZ$0.45 in 2003) per 100 superficial feet (8 pence/m3), though the expense of cutting and removing it to the mills was typically great due to the difficult terrain where they were located.Reed p.79 Probably the most controversial kauri logging decision in the last century was that of the National Government to initiate clear fell logging of the Warawara state forest (North of the Hokianga) in the late 1960s. This created a national outcry as this forest contains the second largest volume of kauri after the Waipoua forest and was until that time, essentially unlogged (Adams, 1980). The plan also involved considerable cost, requiring a long road to be driven up a steep high plateau into the heart of the protected area. Because the stands of kauri were dense, the ecological destruction in the affected plateau area (approximately a fifth of the forest by area, and a quarter by volume of timber) was essentially complete (as of the early 1990s most of the affected area contained a thick covering of native grasses with little or no kauri regeneration). Logging was stopped in fulfillment of an election pledge by the Labour Government of 1972. When the National Party was reelected in 1975, the ban on kauri logging in the Warawara remained in place, but was soon replaced by policies encouraging the logging of giant totara and other podocarps in the central North Island. The outcry over the Warawara was an important stepping stone towards the legal protection of the small percentage of remaining virgin kauri-podocarp forest in New Zealand's Government-owned forests. =Uses= Kauri gum at the Kauri Museum, Northland, New Zealand Although today its use is far more restricted, in the past the size and strength of kauri timber made it a popular wood for construction and ship building, particularly for masts of sailing ships because of its parallel grain and the absence of branches for much of its height. Kauri crown and stump wood was much appreciated for its beauty, and was sought after for ornamental wood panelling as well as high-end furniture. Although not as highly prized, the light colour of kauri trunk wood made it also well-suited for more utilitarian furniture construction, as well as for use in the fabrication of cisterns, barrels, bridges construction material, fences, moulds for metal forges, large rollers for the textile industry, railway sleepers and braces for mines and tunnels. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Kauri gum (semi-fossilised kauri resin) was a valuable commodity, particularly for varnish, spurring the development of a gum-digger industry. Today, the kauri is being considered as a long-term carbon sink. This is because estimates of the total carbon content in living above ground biomass and dead biomass of mature kauri forest are the second highest of any forest type recorded anywhere in the world. The estimated total carbon capture is up to nearly 1000 tones per hectare. In this capacity they are bettered only by mature Eucalyptus regnans forest, and are far higher than any tropical or boreal forest type yet recorded. It is also conjectured that the process of carbon capture does not reach equilibrium, which along with no need of direct maintenance, makes kauri forests a potentially attractive alternative to short rotation Pinus radiata forests, for example. Timber ;Technical specifications * Moisture content of dried wood: 12 per cent * Density of wood: 560 kg/m3 * Tensile strength: 88 MPa * Modulus of elasticity: 9.1 GPa * After felled kauri wood dries to a 12 per cent moisture content, the tangential contraction is 4.1 per cent and the radial contraction is 2.3 per cent. Kauri is considered a first rate timber. The whiter sapwood is generally slightly lighter in weight. Kauri is not highly resistant to rot and when used in boatbuilding must be protected from the elements with paint, varnish or epoxy to avoid rot. Its popularity with boatbuilders is due to its very long clear lengths, relative light weight and beautiful appearance when oiled or varnished. The timber has a beautiful sheen. It planes and saws very well. It holds screws and nails very well. It darkens with age to a richer golden brown colour. It does not easily crack or split or warp. Very little New Zealand kauri is now sold, and the most commonly available kauri in New Zealand is Fiji kauri, which is very similar in appearance but lighter in weight. Swamp kauri Prehistoric kauri forests have been preserved in waterlogged soils as swamp kauri.Adams p.114 A considerable number of kauri have been found buried in salt marshes, resulting from ancient natural changes such as volcanic eruptions, sea-level changes and floods. Such trees have been radiocarbon dated to 50,000 years ago or older. The bark and the seed cones of the trees often survive together with the trunk, although when excavated and exposed to the air, these parts undergo rapid deterioration. The quality of the disinterred wood varies. Some is in good shape, comparable to that of newly felled kauri, although often lighter in colour. The colour can be improved by the use of natural wood stains to heighten the details of the grain. After a drying process, such ancient kauri can be used for furniture, but not for construction. =Conservation= TƒÅne Mahuta ('Lord of the Forest') The small remaining pockets of kauri forest in New Zealand have survived in areas that were not subjected to burning by MƒÅori and were too inaccessible for European loggers. The largest area of mature kauri forest is Waipoua Forest in Northland. Mature and regenerating kauri can also be found in other National and Regional Parks such as Puketi and Omahuta Forests in Northland, the WaitƒÅkere Ranges near Auckland, and Coromandel Forest Park on the Coromandel Peninsula. The importance of Waipoua Forest in relation to the kauri was that it remained the only kauri forest retaining its former virgin condition, and that it was extensive enough to give reasonable promise of permanent survival. On 2 July 1952 an area of over 80 km2 of Waipoua was proclaimed a forest sanctuary after a petition to the Government.Reed p.268-269 The zoologist William Roy McGregor was one of the driving forces in this movement, writing an 80-page illustrated pamphlet on the subject, which proved an effective manifesto for conservation. Along with the Warawara to the North, Waipoua Forest contains three quarters of New Zealand's remaining kauri. Kauri Grove on the Coromandel Peninsula is another area with a remaining cluster of kauri, and includes the Siamese Kauri, two trees with a conjoined lower trunk. In 1921 a philanthropic Cornishman named James Trounson sold to the Government for ¬£40,000, a large area adjacent to a few acres of Crown land and said to contain at least 4,000 kauri trees. From time to time Trounson gifted additional land, until what is known as Trounson Park comprised a total of 4 km2. The most famous specimens are TƒÅne Mahuta and Te Matua Ngahere in Waipoua Forest. These two trees have become tourist attractions because of their size and accessibility. Tane Mahuta, named after the MƒÅori forest god, is the biggest existing kauri with a girth of 13.77 metres (45.2 feet), a trunk height of 17.68 metres (58.0 feet), a total height of 51.2 metres (168 feet) and a total volume including the crown of 516.7 cubic metres (18,247 cubic feet). Te Matua Ngahere, which means 'Father of the Forest', is smaller but stouter than Tane Mahuta, with a girth (circumference) of 16.41 m (53.8 ft). Important note: all the measurements above were taken in 1971.New Zealand Forest Service, Forest Research Institute, Mensuration Report No. 16 1971 (unpublished). Kauri is common as a specimen tree in parks and gardens throughout New Zealand, prized for the distinctive look of young trees, its low maintenance once established (although seedlings are frost tender). Kauri dieback A woman washes her shoes to reduce the spread of kauri dieback disease in Waipoua Forest Kauri dieback was observed in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1950s, again on Great Barrier Island in 1972 linked to a different pathogen, Phytophthora agathidicida and subsequently spread to kauri forest on the mainland. The disease, known as kauri dieback or kauri collar rot, is believed to be over 300 years old and causes yellowing leaves, thinning canopy, dead branches, lesions that bleed resin, and tree death.Gregory, Angela. \\"Waitakere kauri in danger\\". New Zealand Herald. July 12, 2008. Phytophthora agathidicida was identified as a new species in April 2008. Its closest known relative is Phytophthora katsurae.\\"Kauri dieback: What is Phytophthora taxon Agathis?\\". Auckland Council. 29 September 2008.\\"Kauri dieback: how you can help \\". Auckland Council. The pathogen is believed to be spread on people's shoes or by mammals, particularly feral pigs.Borley, Craig. \\"Groups join forces to fight kauri-killer fungus\\". New Zealand Herald. October 18, 2008. A collaborative response team has been formed to work on the disease. The team includes MAF Biosecurity, the Conservation Department, Auckland and Northland regional councils, Waikato Regional Council, and Bay of Plenty Regional Council. The team is charged with assessing the risk, determining methods and their feasibility to limit the spread, collecting more information (e.g. how widespread), and ensuring a coordinated response. The Department of Conservation has issued guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease, including keeping to defined tracks, cleaning footwear before and after entering kauri forest areas, and staying away from kauri roots.Information on kauri dieback See also * Gum-digger * Forestry in New Zealand * Kauri Museum * List of superlative trees * Northland temperate kauri forest References Bibliography  External links * Agathis australis description The Gymnosperm Database * Agathis australis collection at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa * Kauri forest in Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand * Kauri at the New Zealand Department of Conservation * Keep Kauri Standing - Kauri dieback information * Kauri Gum entry from the 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand * Masters thesis on growth and yield of NZ kauri australis Trees of New Zealand Conservation dependent plants ","title":"Agathis australis"},{"id":"171900","title":"Metrosideros excelsa"},{"id":"171902","text":"K≈çwhai flowers K≈çwhai ( or ) are small woody legume trees within the genus Sophora that are native to New Zealand. There are eight species, with Sophora microphylla and S. tetraptera being the most recognised as large trees. Their natural habitat is beside streams and on the edges of forest, in lowland or mountain open areas. K≈çwhai trees grow throughout the country and are a common feature in New Zealand gardens. Outside of New Zealand, k≈çwhai tend to be restricted to mild temperate maritime climates. The blooms of the k≈çwhai are widely regarded as being New Zealand's national flower,\\"Kowhai\\" in New Zealand A to Z. although they have no official status as such.\\"Nationhood and identity\\", in Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand. The word k≈çwhai is also used in the MƒÅori language for the colour yellow, because of the colour of the flowers. The spelling kowhai (without a macron) is common in New Zealand English. Species K≈çwhai tree in full bloom, before foliage has emerged The eight species of k≈çwhai are: * Sophora chathamica, coastal k≈çwhai * Sophora fulvida, Waitakere k≈çwhai * Sophora godleyi, Godley's k≈çwhai * Sophora longicarinata, limestone k≈çwhai * Sophora microphylla, small-leaved k≈çwhai * Sophora molloyi, Cook Strait k≈çwhai * Sophora prostrata, prostrate k≈çwhai * Sophora tetraptera, large-leaved k≈çwhaiThe Current Taxonomy of New Zealand Legumes Description and ecology Sophora tetraptera foliage Sophora tetraptera flowers, foliage and seed pods Most species of k≈çwhai grow to around 8 m high and have fairly smooth bark with small leaves. S. microphylla has smaller leaves (0.5‚Äì0.7 cm long by 0.3‚Äì0.4 cm wide) and flowers (2.5‚Äì3.5 cm long) than S. tetraptera, which has leaves of 1‚Äì2 cm long and flowers that are 3‚Äì5 cm long. The very distinctive seed pods that appear after flowering are almost segmented, and each contains six or more smooth, hard seeds. Most species have yellow seeds, but Sophora prostrata has black ones. The seeds of Sophora microphylla can be very numerous and the presence of many hundreds of these distinctively yellow seeds on the ground quickly identifies the presence of a nearby k≈çwhai tree. Many species of k≈çwhai are semi-deciduous and lose most of their leaves immediately after flowering in October or November, but quickly produce new leaves. Flowering of k≈çwhai is staggered from July through to November, meaning each tree will get attention from birds such as tui, wood pigeon and bellbird. Tui are very attracted to k≈çwhai and will fly long distances to get a sip of its nectar. The wood of k≈çwhai is dense and strong and has been used in the past for tools and machinery. Sophora is one of the four genera of native legumes in New Zealand; the other three are Carmichaelia, Clianthus, and Montigena. Cultivation K≈çwhai can be grown from seed or tip cuttings in spring and autumn. The dark or bright yellow seeds germinate best after chitting and being soaked in water for several hours. They can also benefit from a several minute submersion in boiling water to soften the hard shell and then being kept in the same water, taken off boil, for several hours to soak up the water. Raising Native Plants From Seed Young k≈çwhai are quite frost tender, so cuttings or seedlings should be planted in their second year when they are 30 cm or higher. If grown from seed, k≈çwhai can take many years to flower, the number of years varies depending on the species. S. prostrata, sometimes called \\"little baby\\", is used as a bonsai tree. It grows up to two metres high, has zigzagging stems, and sparse smallish leaves. Dangers All parts of the k≈çwhai, but particularly the seeds, are poisonous to humans. However, there do not appear to have been any confirmed cases in humans of severe poisoning following ingestion of k≈çwhai in New Zealand. Traditional MƒÅori use Traditionally the MƒÅori used the flexible branches as a construction material in their houses and to snare birds. The k≈çwhai flowers were a source of yellow dye. Also, when the k≈çwhai flowers bloom, in late winter and early spring, it is time to plant kumara (sweet potato). MƒÅori also used the k≈çwhai tree as medicine. The bark was heated in a calabash with hot stones, and made into a poultice to treat wounds or rubbed on a sore back or made into an infusion to treat bruising or muscular pains. If someone was bitten by a seal, an infusion (wai k≈çwhai) was prepared from k≈çwhai and applied to the wounds and the patient was said to recover within days.

It is based on earlier blues idioms, such as Delta blues, but performed in an urban style.  History  Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African Americans from the southern U.S. to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Big Bill Broonzy and Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, escaping the more harsh southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, \\"Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it.\\" Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago blues singer and guitarist Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, \\"You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can't keep talking about mules, workin' on the levee.\\"William H. Frey, \\"The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965‚Äì2000\\", The Brookings Institution, May 2004, pp. 1‚Äì3, accessed 19 March 2008. Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesmen who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s. The development of blues, up to Chicago blues, is arguably as follows: Country blues, to city blues, to urban blues. Chicago blues is based on the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier, both heavily amplified and often to the point of distortion, and a rhythm section of drums and bass (double bass at first, and later electric bass guitar) with piano depending on the song or performer. Urban blues started in Chicago and St. Louis, as music created by part-time musicians playing as street musicians, at rent parties, and other events in the black community. For example, bottleneck guitarist Kokomo Arnold was a steelworker and had a moonshine business that was far more profitable than his music. Maxwell Street blues performers and onlookers circa 1950 An early incubator for Chicago blues was the open-air market on Maxwell Street, one of the largest open-air markets in the nation. Residents of the black community would frequent it to buy and sell just about anything. It was a natural location for blues musicians to perform, earn tips, and jam with other musicians. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and eventually make their way to blues clubs. The first blues clubs in Chicago were mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the South Side, with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the West Side. New trends in technology, chaotic streets and bars adding drums to an electric mix, gave birth to a new club culture. One of the most famous was Ruby Lee Gatewood's Tavern, known by patrons as \\"The Gates\\". During the 1930s virtually every big-name artist played there. What drove the blues to international influence was the promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records. Through such record companies Chicago blues became a commercial enterprise. The new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, young British musicians were highly influenced by Chicago blues resulting in the British blues movement. According to Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Chicago blues saw its best documentation during the 1970s thanks in part to Alligator Records and its owner Bruce Iglauer, described by Robert Christgau as a \\"folkie Leonard Chess. Influence of Chicago blues Chicago blues was one of the most significant influences on early rock music. Chuck Berry originally signed with Chess Records‚Äîone of the most significant Chicago blues record labels. Berry met and was influenced by Muddy Waters in Chicago and Waters suggested he audition for Chess. Willie Dixon and other blues musicians played on some of Berry's early records. In the UK in the early 1960s, beat groups, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals (dubbed the British invasion in the US), were heavily influenced by Chicago blues artists.Inaba, Mitsutoshi.

At the same time, American artists, such as the Paul Butterfield Blues Band (who included two members of Howlin' Wolf's band), John P. Hammond, and Charlie Musselwhite performed in the style of Chicago blues. Later, Cream, Rory Gallagher, and the Allman Brothers Band also pursued their own interpretations of Chicago blues songs and helped popularize blues rock.

In addition to the original Memory Stick, this family includes the Memory Stick PRO, a revision that allows greater maximum storage capacity and faster file transfer speeds; Memory Stick Duo, a small-form- factor version of the Memory Stick (including the PRO Duo); the even smaller Memory Stick Micro (M2), and the Memory Stick PRO-HG, a high speed variant of the PRO to be used in high-definition video and still cameras. As a proprietary format, Sony exclusively used Memory Stick on its products in the 2000s such as Cyber-shot digital cameras, Handycam digital camcorders, WEGA and Bravia TV sets, VAIO PCs, early Walkman digital audio players, and the PlayStation Portable handheld game console, with the format being licensed to a few other companies early in its lifetime. With increasing popularity of SD card, in 2010 Sony started to support the SD card format, which was seen as a Sony loss in the memory-card format war. Despite this, Sony continued to support Memory Stick on certain devices.  History  The original Memory Stick, which was launched in October 1998, was available in capacities up to 128 MB.In this article the unit symbol 'MB' is used to mean 1000^2 bytes (1 megabyte) In October 1999, Sony licensed the technology to Fujitsu, Aiwa, Sanyo, Sharp, Pioneer and Kenwood, in a bid to avoid a repetition of the Betamax failure. Other companies were also licensees to the format. Some early examples of Memory Stick usage by third-party companies include Sharp's MP3 players, Alpine's in-dash players, and Epson's printers.http://www.simmtester.com/page/news/showpubnews.asp?num=64 Initially the format had a lukewarm reception, but it soon increased in popularity, especially after the licensing deal. In spring 2001, Memory Stick attained 25% market share (against CompactFlash's 40% and SmartMedia's 32%), up from 7% a year earlier. By May 2001, total shipment of Memory Stick units surpassed 10 million. However the SD card, jointly developed by Toshiba, Panasonic and SanDisk, became widely popular among companies and soon became the most popular flash format by November 2003 it held 42% market share in the United States, ahead of CompactFlash's 26% and Memory Stick with 16%. Eventually Sony itself became the only company to support the format. Sony was often criticized for the Memory Stick, as they were deemed to be expensive compared to other formats.https://www.economist.com/node/3738979 , it appeared that Sony had begun to combine support for SD/SDHC and Memory Stick formats in their products. All digital cameras and camcorders announced by Sony at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show could use SD and SDHC cards as well as Memory Sticks. Furthermore, Sony is releasing its own line of SD cards. Many claim this development as the end of the format war between Memory Stick and SD card. However, Sony did not abandon the format at this time, and has indicated it will continue development of the format for the foreseeable future. A prime example is the development of WiFi transfers through a special Memory Stick PRO-Duo which is still in development as of 2011. Sony's first significant migration away from Memory Stick did not come until 2019, when it introduced the Œ±7R IV full-frame mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera without Memory Stick support, opting instead for dual SDXC slots. Memory Stick cards were almost entirely produced by Sony itself. SanDisk and Lexar were among the few third-party Memory Stick producers.  Applications  Typically, Memory Sticks are used as storage media for a portable device, in a form that can easily be removed for access by a personal computer. For example, Sony digital compact cameras use Memory Stick for storing image files. With a Memory Stick- capable memory card reader a user can copy the pictures taken with the Sony digital camera to a computer. Sony typically included Memory Stick reader hardware in its first-party consumer electronics, such as digital cameras, digital music players, PDAs, cellular phones, the VAIO line of laptop computers, TV sets under the WEGA and Bravia names, and Sony's handheld gaming device, the PlayStation Portable. A special Memory Stick can be inserted in the hindquarters of Sony's AIBO robot pet, to enable the use of Aiboware‚Äîsoftware intended for use on AIBOs. The Sticks include a copy protection mechanism used by the robot, allowing users to write programs. These are referred to as programmable or programming. Only 8 MB and 16 MB versions are available.  Formats and form factors  Memory Sticks include a wide range of actual formats, including three different form factors. = Memory Stick = The original Memory Stick Sony Memory Stick with MagicGate The original Memory Stick is approximately the size and thickness of a stick of chewing gum. It was available in capacities from 4 MB to 128 MB (1 MB = one million bytes). It was available both with and without MagicGate support. The MagicGate-capable memory sticks were white-colored, while the standard version was purple. The original Memory Stick is no longer manufactured. = Memory Stick Select = Lexar 256 MB Memory Stick Select with memory switch In response to the storage limitations of the original Memory Stick, Sony introduced the Memory Stick Select at CES 2003 on January 9. The Memory Stick Select contained two separate 128 MB partitions which the user could switch between using a physical switch on the card. This solution was fairly unpopular, but it did give users of older Memory Stick devices more capacity. Its physical size remained the same as the original Memory Stick. = Memory Stick PRO = The Memory Stick PRO, introduced on January 9, 2003 as a joint effort between Sony and SanDisk, would be the longer-lasting solution to the space problem. Most devices that use the original Memory Sticks support both the original and PRO sticks since both formats have identical form factors. Some readers that were not compatible could be upgraded to Memory Stick PRO support via a firmware update. Memory Stick PROs have a marginally higher transfer speed and a maximum theoretical capacity of 32 GBIn this article the unit symbol 'GB' is used to mean 1000^3 bytes (1 gigabyte), although it appears GB-sized capacities are only available in the PRO Duo form factor. High Speed Memory Stick PROs are available, and newer devices support this high-speed mode, allowing for faster file transfers. All Memory Stick PROs larger than 1 GB support this high-speed mode, and High Speed Memory Stick PROs are backwards-compatible with devices that don't support the high-speed mode. High-capacity Memory Sticks such as the 4 GB versions are expensive compared to other types of flash memory such as SD cards and CompactFlash. , 512 MB Memory Stick PRO can be bought. = Memory Stick Duo = The Memory Stick Duo was developed in response to Sony's need for a smaller flash memory card for pocket-sized digital cameras, cell phones and the PlayStation Portable. It is slightly smaller than the competing Secure Digital (SD) format and roughly two thirds the length of the standard Memory Stick form factor, but costs more. Memory Stick Duos are available with the same features as the larger standard Memory Stick, available with and without high speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support. The Memory Stick PRO Duo has replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to its 128 MB size limitation, but has kept the same form factor as the Duo. Memory Stick Duo Adaptor and Memory Stick PRO Duo A simple adapter allows Memory Stick Duo to be used in devices designed to accept the original Memory Stick form factor. = Memory Stick PRO Duo = A Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo (2 GB) The Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSPD) quickly replaced the Memory Stick Duo due to the Duo's size limitation of 128 MB and slow transfer speed. Memory Stick PRO Duos are available in all the same variants as the larger Memory Stick PRO, with and without High Speed mode, and with and without MagicGate support. Sony has released different versions of Memory Stick PRO Duo. A Memory Stick PRO Duo with MagicGate was released as a 512 MB stick. Additionally, a 16 GB version on March 2008 and another a 32 GB version on August 21, 2009. In 2009, Sony and SanDisk also announced the joint development of an expanded Memory Stick PRO format tentatively named \\"Memory Stick PRO Format for Extended High Capacity\\". Sony has since finalized the format and released its specification under the new name, Memory Stick XC (see below). = Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo = PRO-HG Duo (8 GB) On December 11, 2006, Sony, together with SanDisk, announced the Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo. While only serial and 4-bit parallel interfaces are supported in the Memory Stick PRO format, an 8-bit parallel interface was added to the Memory Stick PRO-HG format. Also, the maximum interface clock frequency was increased from 40 MHz to 60 MHz. With these enhancements, a theoretical transfer rate of 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s) is achieved, which is three times faster than the Memory Stick PRO format. = Memory Stick Micro (M2) = Memory Stick Micro In a joint venture with SanDisk, Sony released a new Memory Stick format on February 6, 2006. The Memory Stick Micro (M2) measures 15 √ó 12.5 √ó 1.2 mm (roughly one-quarter the size of the Duo) with 64 MB, 128 MB, 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, and 16 GB capacities available. The format has a theoretical limit of 32 GB and maximum transfer speed of 160 Mbit/s. However, as with the PRO Duo format, it has been expanded through the XC series as Memory Stick XC Micro and Memory Stick XC-HG Micro, both with the theoretical maximum capacity of 2 TB.In this article the unit symbol 'TB' is used to mean 1000^4 bytes (1 terabyte) The M2 comes with an adapter, much like the Duo Sticks, to ensure physical compatibility with Memory Stick PRO devices. However, not all devices with a PRO slot are compatible with the M2/Adapter combination, as the firmware of older devices don't support the higher capacity of some M2 cards. One example is certain Sony CLI√â PDAs which don't support cards larger than 2 GB. Sony announced on June 1, 2009, that M2 support in Sony Ericsson phones would be dropped in favor of microSD. The Sony DSC-RX0 Mark II made a revived usage of M2 slots. = Memory Stick XC = On January 7, 2009, SanDisk and Sony announced the Memory Stick XC format (tentatively named \\"Memory Stick Format Series for Extended High Capacity\\" at the time). The Memory Stick XC has a maximum theoretical 2 TB capacity, 64 times larger than that of the Memory Stick PRO Duo which is limited to 32 GB. XC series has the same form factors as PRO series, and supports MagicGate content protection technology as well as Access Control function as PRO series does. In line with the rest of the industry, the XC series uses the newer exFAT file system due to size and formatting limitations of FAT/FAT16/FAT32 filesystems used in the PRO series. A maximum transfer speed of 480 Mbit/s (60 Mbyte/s) is achieved through 8-bit parallel data transfer. = Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo HX = Sony announced the release of the Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo HX on May 17, 2011, which was considered the fastest card ever made by the manufacturer. It measures 20 √ó 31 √ó 1.6 mm, with 8 GB, 16 GB, or 32 GB versions available. Also, the format offers a maximum transfer speed of 50 MB/s.http://presscentre.sony.co.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID;=6713  Mark 2 certification  As of early 2008, Mark 2-certified versions of the Memory Stick PRO Duo became available. The Mark 2 designation indicates the Memory Stick is suitable for use with AVCHD recording products or other faster Memory Stick enabled devices by providing appropriate minimum write performance.

Proposed by , it seeks to relate Galois groups in algebraic number theory to automorphic forms and representation theory of algebraic groups over local fields and adeles. Widely seen as the single biggest project in modern mathematical research, the Langlands program has been described by Edward Frenkel as ‚Äúa kind of grand unified theory of mathematics.‚Äù Background In a very broad context, the program built on existing ideas: the philosophy of cusp forms formulated a few years earlier by Harish-Chandra and , the work and approach of Harish-Chandra on semisimple Lie groups, and in technical terms the trace formula of Selberg and others. What initially was very new in Langlands' work, besides technical depth, was the proposed direct connection to number theory, together with the rich organisational structure hypothesised (so-called functoriality). For example, in the work of Harish-Chandra one finds the principle that what can be done for one semisimple (or reductive) Lie group, should be done for all. Therefore, once the role of some low-dimensional Lie groups such as GL(2) in the theory of modular forms had been recognised, and with hindsight GL(1) in class field theory, the way was open at least to speculation about GL(n) for general n > 2. The cusp form idea came out of the cusps on modular curves but also had a meaning visible in spectral theory as \\"discrete spectrum\\", contrasted with the \\"continuous spectrum\\" from Eisenstein series. It becomes much more technical for bigger Lie groups, because the parabolic subgroups are more numerous. In all these approaches there was no shortage of technical methods, often inductive in nature and based on Levi decompositions amongst other matters, but the field was and is very demanding. And on the side of modular forms, there were examples such as Hilbert modular forms, Siegel modular forms, and theta-series.  Objects There are a number of related Langlands conjectures. There are many different groups over many different fields for which they can be stated, and for each field there are several different versions of the conjectures. Some versions of the Langlands conjectures are vague, or depend on objects such as the Langlands groups, whose existence is unproven, or on the L-group that has several inequivalent definitions. Moreover, the Langlands conjectures have evolved since Langlands first stated them in 1967. There are different types of objects for which the Langlands conjectures can be stated: *Representations of reductive groups over local fields (with different subcases corresponding to archimedean local fields, p-adic local fields, and completions of function fields) *Automorphic forms on reductive groups over global fields (with subcases corresponding to number fields or function fields). *Finite fields. Langlands did not originally consider this case, but his conjectures have analogues for it. *More general fields, such as function fields over the complex numbers. Conjectures There are several different ways of stating the Langlands conjectures, which are closely related but not obviously equivalent. =Reciprocity= The starting point of the program may be seen as Emil Artin's reciprocity law, which generalizes quadratic reciprocity. The Artin reciprocity law applies to a Galois extension of an algebraic number field whose Galois group is abelian; it assigns L-functions to the one-dimensional representations of this Galois group, and states that these L-functions are identical to certain Dirichlet L-series or more general series (that is, certain analogues of the Riemann zeta function) constructed from Hecke characters. The precise correspondence between these different kinds of L-functions constitutes Artin's reciprocity law. For non-abelian Galois groups and higher-dimensional representations of them, one can still define L-functions in a natural way: Artin L-functions. The insight of Langlands was to find the proper generalization of Dirichlet L-functions, which would allow the formulation of Artin's statement in this more general setting. Hecke had earlier related Dirichlet L-functions with automorphic forms (holomorphic functions on the upper half plane of C that satisfy certain functional equations). Langlands then generalized these to automorphic cuspidal representations, which are certain infinite dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear group GL(n) over the adele ring of Q. (This ring simultaneously keeps track of all the completions of Q, see p-adic numbers.) Langlands attached automorphic L-functions to these automorphic representations, and conjectured that every Artin L-function arising from a finite-dimensional representation of the Galois group of a number field is equal to one arising from an automorphic cuspidal representation. This is known as his \\"reciprocity conjecture\\". Roughly speaking, the reciprocity conjecture gives a correspondence between automorphic representations of a reductive group and homomorphisms from a Langlands group to an L-group. There are numerous variations of this, in part because the definitions of Langlands group and L-group are not fixed. Over local fields this is expected to give a parameterization of L-packets of admissible irreducible representations of a reductive group over the local field. For example, over the real numbers, this correspondence is the Langlands classification of representations of real reductive groups. Over global fields, it should give a parameterization of automorphic forms. =Functoriality= The functoriality conjecture states that a suitable homomorphism of L-groups is expected to give a correspondence between automorphic forms (in the global case) or representations (in the local case). Roughly speaking, the Langlands reciprocity conjecture is the special case of the functoriality conjecture when one of the reductive groups is trivial. Generalized functoriality Langlands generalized the idea of functoriality: instead of using the general linear group GL(n), other connected reductive groups can be used. Furthermore, given such a group G, Langlands constructs the Langlands dual group LG, and then, for every automorphic cuspidal representation of G and every finite-dimensional representation of LG, he defines an L-function. One of his conjectures states that these L-functions satisfy a certain functional equation generalizing those of other known L-functions. He then goes on to formulate a very general \\"Functoriality Principle\\". Given two reductive groups and a (well behaved) morphism between their corresponding L-groups, this conjecture relates their automorphic representations in a way that is compatible with their L-functions. This functoriality conjecture implies all the other conjectures presented so far. It is of the nature of an induced representation construction‚Äîwhat in the more traditional theory of automorphic forms had been called a 'lifting', known in special cases, and so is covariant (whereas a restricted representation is contravariant). Attempts to specify a direct construction have only produced some conditional results. All these conjectures can be formulated for more general fields in place of Q: algebraic number fields (the original and most important case), local fields, and function fields (finite extensions of Fp(t) where p is a prime and Fp(t) is the field of rational functions over the finite field with p elements). =Geometric conjectures= The so-called geometric Langlands program, suggested by G√©rard Laumon following ideas of Vladimir Drinfeld, arises from a geometric reformulation of the usual Langlands program that attempts to relate more than just irreducible representations. In simple cases, it relates -adic representations of the √©tale fundamental group of an algebraic curve to objects of the derived category of -adic sheaves on the moduli stack of vector bundles over the curve. Current status The Langlands conjectures for GL(1, K) follow from (and are essentially equivalent to) class field theory. Langlands proved the Langlands conjectures for groups over the archimedean local fields R and C by giving the Langlands classification of their irreducible representations. Lusztig's classification of the irreducible representations of groups of Lie type over finite fields can be considered an analogue of the Langlands conjectures for finite fields. Andrew Wiles' proof of modularity of semistable elliptic curves over rationals can be viewed as an instance of the Langlands reciprocity conjecture, since the main idea is to relate the Galois representations arising from elliptic curves to modular forms. Although Wiles' results have been substantially generalized, in many different directions, the full Langlands conjecture for GL(2, Q) remains unproved. In 1998, Laurent Lafforgue proved Lafforgue's theorem verifying the Langlands conjectures for the general linear group GL(n, K) for function fields K. This work continued earlier investigations by Drinfeld, who proved the case GL(2, K) in the 1980s. In 2012, Vincent Lafforgue established the global Langlands correspondence (the direction from automorphic forms to Galois representations) for connected reductive groups over global function fields.http://www.icm2018.org/portal/program-at-a-glance.html, V.

It is typically a shrub growing to tall, but can grow into a moderately sized tree, up to or so in height. It is evergreen, with dense branching and small leaves long and broad, with a short spine tip. The flowers are white, occasionally pink, (rarely up to ) in diameter, with five petals. The wood is tough and hard. This species is often confused with the related species kƒÅnuka (Kunzea ericoides) ‚Äì the easiest way to tell the difference between the two species in the field is to feel their foliage ‚Äì mƒÅnuka leaves are prickly, while kƒÅnuka leaves are soft.J. Dawson, R. Lucas, Nature guide to the New Zealand forest. Godwit, 2000 Alternatively, the seed capsules of mƒÅnuka are large ( in diameter) and often remain on the plant year round, whereas the seed capsules of kƒÅnuka are much smaller ( in diameter) and are not present for much of the year. The Latin specific epithet scoparium means \\"like broom\\", referring to Northern Hemisphere genera such as Genista and Cytisus which it superficially resembles, but to which it is only distantly related. History and habitat Evidence suggests that L. scoparium originated in New Zealand before the onset of the Miocene aridity, and moved as a result of long-distance dispersal events from New Zealand to eastern Australia sometime during the last 20 million years. Cyclones and other wind activity are most likely responsible for transporting seeds long distances. Supporters of this claim cite evidence that the genus Leptospermum arose under conditions where frequent forest fires were common (i.e. in Australia, and not temperate New Zealand), because they possess fire-adaptive traits like serotiny and storage lignotubers. It has been postulated that on arrival in New Zealand, L. scoparium became established in limited edaphically suitable areas until the arrival of the Polynesian people, whose fire and forest- clearing brought about the low-nutrient-status soils for which it was preadapted in its homeland. It is now more common in New Zealand than it is in Australia. It is found throughout New Zealand, but is particularly common on the drier east coasts of the North and South Islands, and in Australia in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales.  Ecology  = Pests and diseases = The adult mƒÅnuka beetle (Pyronota festiva) and its larvae feed on L. scoparium in New Zealand. = Pollinators = Various pollinators are known to visit L. scoparium, some examples include Melangyna novaezelandiae, Hylaeus, and Honeybees. = Continued evolution = Leptospermum scoparium is in the process of evolutionary differentiation as a result of its isolation from fellow members of the Leptospermum genus. New studies demonstrate a loss of lignotubers among populations of Leptospermum scoparium located in relatively fire-free zones of New Zealand's South Island, while Australian and Tasmanian populations retain their lignotubers along with stronger manifestations of serotiny. Australian populations of Leptospermum scoparium are shown to be chemically distinct from their New Zealand counterparts, with significantly higher levels of cinteole and monoterpines. Chemotypical variations also exist between different populations within New Zealand, leading some to suggest that L. scoparium be divided into three subspecies: those with high pinenes, high triketones, and high sesquiterpenes. Recently, however, new research suggests that plant-to-plant variation far outstrips the variation seen between geographically isolated manuka sites, at least with regard to nectar chemistry. Names Tea tree, ' and ' are common names for this species. \\"Jelly bush\\" is also used in Australia to describe similar honey from Leptospermum polygalifolium. Tea tree arose because Captain Cook used the leaves to make a 'tea' drink.J. T. Salmon, The Native Trees of New Zealand, Reed, 1973. MƒÅnuka is a MƒÅori word from New Zealand. Cultivation Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *(Nanum Group) 'Kiwi' *'Nichollsii Nanum' *'Red Damask' *'Silver Sheen' Many more cultivars are available in New Zealand but often the plant performs better in cultivation overseas. This is because in its homeland it is subject to attack by scale insects that secrete a honeydew on which grows a sooty mould that eventually debilitates the plant. Because of this, attempts have been made, with limited commercial success, to cross the showy New Zealand cultivars with mould-resistant Australian Leptospermum species. Uses MƒÅnuka (Leptospermum scoparium) essential oil in a clear glass vial The wood was often used for tool handles. MƒÅnuka sawdust imparts a delicious flavour when used for smoking meats and fish. It is cultivated in New Zealand for mƒÅnuka honey, produced when honeybees gather the nectar from its flowers, and for the pharmaceutical industry. It is also used for carving. An essential oil, for which many medicinal claims are made, is produced by steam distillation of its leaves. Manuka, as it is called by most New Zealanders, was used in pre-European times by Maori, and still is. A decoction of the leaves was drunk for urinary complaints and as a febrifuge (an agent for reducing fever). The steam from leaves boiled in water was inhaled for head colds. A decoction was prepared from the leaves and bark and the warm liquid was rubbed on stiff muscles and aching joints. The emollient white gum, called pai Manuka, was given to nursing babies and also used to treat scalds and burns. Chewing the bark is said to have a relaxing effect and it enhances sleep.http://www.manukaoil.com/manuka_oil_uses.htm Parakeets and parasites Kakariki parakeets (Cyanoramphus) use the leaves and bark of mƒÅnuka and kƒÅnuka to rid themselves of parasites. Apart from ingesting the material, they also chew it, mix it with preen gland oil and apply it to their feathers.T. Greene, Antiparasitic behaviour in New Zealand parakeets (Cyanoramphus species).

It originated in the Mississippi Delta, and is regarded as a regional variant of country blues. Guitar and harmonica are its dominant instruments; slide guitar is a hallmark of the style. Vocal styles in Delta blues range from introspective and soulful to passionate and fiery. Origin Although Delta blues certainly existed in some form or another at the turn of the 20th century, it was first recorded in the late 1920s, when record companies realized the potential African-American market for \\"race records\\". The major labels produced the earliest recordings, consisting mostly of one person singing and playing an instrument. Live performances, however, more commonly involved a group of musicians. Current belief is that Freddie Spruell is the first Delta blues artist to have been recorded; his \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" was recorded in Chicago in June 1926. Record company talent scouts made some of the early recordings on field trips to the South, and some performers were invited to travel to northern cities to record. According to Dixon and Godrich (1981), Tommy Johnson and Ishmon Bracey were recorded by Victor on that company's second field trip to Memphis, in 1928. Robert Wilkins was first recorded by Victor in Memphis in 1928, and Big Joe Williams and Garfield Akers by Brunswick/Vocalion, also in Memphis, in 1929. Son House first recorded in Grafton, Wisconsin, in 1930 for Paramount Records. Charley Patton also recorded for Paramount in Grafton, in June 1929 and May 1930. He also traveled to New York City for recording sessions in January and February 1934. Robert Johnson recorded his only sessions, for ARC, in San Antonio in 1936 and Dallas in 1937. Many other artists were recorded during this period. Subsequently, the early Delta blues (as well as other genres) were extensively recorded by John Lomax and his son Alan Lomax, who crisscrossed the southern U.S. recording music played and sung by ordinary people, helping establish the canon of genres we know today as American folk music. Their recordings, numbering in the thousands, now reside in the Smithsonian Institution. According to Dixon and Godrich (1981) and Leadbitter and Slaven (1968), Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress researchers did not record any Delta bluesmen or women prior to 1941, when he recorded Son House and Willie Brown near Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, and Muddy Waters at Stovall, Mississippi. However, this claim has been disputed, as John and Alan Lomax had recorded Bukka White in 1939, Lead Belly in 1933 and most likely others. Female performers In big-city blues, women singers such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith dominated the recordings of the 1920s. However, women rarely recorded Delta blues and other rural or folk-style blues. In Delta blues female performers often had some romantic connection to more notable male performers: Geeshie Wiley was reportedly linked with Papa Charlie McCoy, whose brother Kansas Joe McCoy was married to Memphis Minnie, and the seminal Charlie Patton sometimes played and recorded with his wife, Bertha Lee. It was not until late in the 1960s that women began to be heard in recorded performances at the level they had previously enjoyed. It was then that Janis Joplin arrived as the first female performer to achieve both accolades from her peers as a blues performer and crossover commercial success, reaching diverse audiences with a powerful and emotive vocal delivery. Other women influenced by Delta blues, who learned from some of the most notable of the original artists still living, include Bonnie Raitt, Rory Block, and Susan Tedeschi. Influence Many Delta blues artists, such as Big Joe Williams, moved to Detroit and Chicago, creating a pop-influenced city blues style. This was displaced by the new Chicago blues sound in the early 1950s, pioneered by Delta bluesmen Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter, harking back to a Delta-influenced sound, but with amplified instruments. Delta blues was also an inspiration for the creation of British skiffle music, from which eventually came the British invasion bands, while simultaneously influencing British blues, which led to the birth of early hard rock and heavy metal.

It occurred in the same area in the Ionian Sea as the Battle of Actium, 31 BC. It was one of the three largest sea battles that took place in the sixteenth century Mediterranean, along with the Battle of Djerba and the Battle of Lepanto. Background A satellite view of Lefkada and the Gulf of Arta. Preveza is located at the entrance of the Gulf. In 1537, commanding a large Ottoman fleet, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured a number of Aegean and Ionian islands belonging to the Republic of Venice, namely Syros, Aegina, Ios, Paros, Tinos, Karpathos, Kasos, and Naxos, thus annexing the Duchy of Naxos to the Ottoman Empire. He then unsuccessfully besieged the Venetian stronghold of Corfu and ravaged the Spanish-held Calabrian coast in southern Italy.Roger Crowley, Empires of the Sea, faber and faber 2008 pp.67-69 In the face of this threat, Pope Paul III succeeded in February 1538 in assembling a ‚Äô‚ÄôHoly League‚Äô‚Äô, comprising the Papacy, Spain, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Venice, and the Knights of Malta, to confront Barbarossa. Forces Barbarossa's fleet that summer numbered 122 galleys and galliots. That of the Holy League comprised 300 galleys and galleons (55 Venetian galleys, 61 Genoese/Papal, 10 sent by the Knights Hospitaller, and 50 by the Spanish). Andrea Doria, the Genoese admiral in the service of Emperor Charles V was in overall command. Deployment Deployment of the opposing fleets The Holy League assembled its fleet near the island of Corfu. The Papal fleet under Admiral Marco Grimani (Patriarch of Aquileia) and the Venetian fleet under Vincenzo Capello arrived first. Andrea Doria joined them with the Spanish-Genoese fleet on 22 September 1538. Prior to Doria's arrival, Grimani attempted to land troops near the Fortress of Preveza, but he retreated to Corfu after suffering a number of casualties in the ensuing encounter with Ottoman forces. Barbarossa was still at the island of Kos in the Aegean Sea at that time, but he soon arrived at Preveza with the rest of the Ottoman fleet, after capturing the island of Kefalonia on the way. Sinan Reis, one of his lieutenants, suggested landing troops at Actium on the Gulf of Arta near Preveza, an idea that Barbarossa initially opposed, but which later proved to be important in securing the Ottoman victory. With the Turks holding the fortress at Actium, they could support Barbarossa's fleet with artillery fire from there, while Doria had to keep his ships away from the coast. A Christian landing to take Actium probably would have been needed to ensure success, but Doria was fearful of a defeat on land after the initial sortie by Grimani had been repelled. Two more attempts by the Holy League to land their forces, this time near the fortress of Preveza at the opposite shore facing Actium, were repulsed by the forces of Murat Reis on 25 and 26 September. As Doria's ships kept their distance from the coast, much concerned about adverse winds driving them onto a hostile shore, Barbarossa had the advantageous interior position. During the night of 27‚Äì28 September, Doria therefore sailed 30 miles south and, when the wind died down, anchored at Sessola near the island of Lefkada. During the night, he and his commanders decided that their best option was to stage an attack towards Lepanto and force Barbarossa to fight. The battle At dawn, however, Doria was surprised to see that the Turks were coming towards his ships. Barbarossa had taken his fleet out of the anchorage and headed south as well. Turgut Reis was in the van with six large fustas, and the left wing closely hugged the shore. Not expecting such a daring offensive from the numerically inferior Ottoman fleet, it took Doria three hours to give the order to weigh anchor and ready for battle‚Äîpressed by Grimani and Capello. The two fleets finally engaged on 28 September 1538 in the Gulf of Arta, near Preveza. The lack of wind was not in Doria's favor. The huge Venetian flagship Galeone di Venezia with her massive guns was becalmed four miles from land and ten miles from Sessola. While the Christian ships struggled to come to her assistance, she was soon surrounded by enemy galleys and engaged in a furious battle that lasted hours and did much damage to the Ottoman galleys. When the wind rose, the Christian fleet finally approached the action, although Doria first executed a number of maneuvres designed to draw the Turks out to sea. Ferrante Gonzaga, the Viceroy of Sicily, was at the left wing of the combined fleet, while the Maltese Knights were at the right wing. Doria placed four of his fastest galleys under the command of his nephew Giovanni Andrea Doria who was positioned in the center front, between Gonzaga and the Maltese Knights. Doria's galleys formed a long line behind them, in front of the Papal and Venetian galleys of Grimani and Capello. In the rear were the Venetian galleons under the command of Alessandro Condalmiero (Bondumier) and the Spanish-Portuguese-Genoese galleons under the command of Francesco Doria, together with the barques and support ships. The Ottoman fleet had a Y shaped configuration: Barbarossa, together with his son Hasan Reis (later Hasan Pasha), Sinan Reis, Cafer Reis, and ≈ûaban Reis, was at the center; Seydi Ali Reis commanded the left wing; Salih Reis commanded the right wing; while Turgut Reis, accompanied by Murat Reis, G√ºzelce Mehmet Reis, and Sadƒ±k Reis, commanded the rear wing. The Turks swiftly engaged the Venetian, Papal, and Maltese ships, but Doria hesitated to bring his center into action against Barbarossa, which led to much tactical maneuvering but little fighting. Barbarossa wanted to take advantage of the lack of wind which immobilized the Christian barques that accounted for most of the numerical difference between the two sides. These barques fell as easy prey to the Turks who boarded them from their relatively more mobile galleys and galliots. Doria's efforts to trap the Ottoman ships between the cannon fire of his barques and galleys failed. At the end of the day, the Turks sunk,destroyed or captured 128 ships and had taken about 3,000 prisoners. The Turks did not lose any ships but suffered 400 dead and 800 wounded. A number of Ottoman ships had been seriously damaged, however, by the cannon fire of the massive Galeone di Venezia, the Venetian flagship under the command of Alessandro Condalmiero. The next morning, with favorable wind, and unwilling to risk the Spanish- Genoese ships, Doria set sail and left the battlefield for Corfu, deaf to the pleas of the Venetian, Papal, and Maltese commanders to continue the fight. Aftermath It is widely speculated that Doria's prevarication and lack of zeal were due to his unwillingness to risk his own ships (he personally owned a substantial number of the \\"Spanish-Genoese\\" fleet) and his long-standing enmity towards Venice, his home city's fierce rival and the primary target of Ottoman aggression at that time.Roger Crowley, Empires of the Sea, faber and faber 2008 p.71 In 1539 Barbarossa returned and captured almost all the remaining Christian outposts in the Ionian and Aegean Seas. A peace treaty was signed between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in October 1540, under which the Turks took control of the Venetian possessions in the Morea and in Dalmatia and of the formerly Venetian islands in the Aegean, Ionian, and eastern Adriatic Seas. Venice also had to pay a war indemnification of 300,000 ducats of gold to the Ottoman Empire. With the victory at Preveza and the subsequent victory in the Battle of Djerba in 1560, the Ottomans succeeded in repulsing the efforts of Venice and Spain, the two principal rival powers in the Mediterranean, to stop their drive for controlling the sea. The Ottoman supremacy in large-scale fleet battles in the Mediterranean Sea remained unchallenged until the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Nicol√≤ Zen the younger wrote his History of the War between Venice and the Turks which primarily consisted of an invective against those who had called for the war against the Ottomans in which they had behaved so ingloriously. The text was not published but a manuscript of it was circulated in his household and survived and is now held by the Biblioteca Marciana.

It grows throughout the North Island and northeastern South Island in lowland, montane and lower subalpine forest at elevations of up to 600 m. T≈çtara is commonly found in lowland areas where the soil is fertile and well drained. Description The t≈çtara is a medium to large tree which grows slowly to around 20 to 25 m, exceptionally to 35 m; it is noted for its longevity and the great girth of its trunk. The bark peels off in papery flakes, with a purplish to golden brown hue. The sharp, dull green needle-like leaves are stiff and leathery, 2 cm long. This plant produces highly modified cones with 2 to 4 fused, fleshy berry-like juicy scales, bright red when mature. The cone contains one or two rounded seeds at the apex of the scales. Largest known living t≈çtara, the Pouakani Tree The largest known living t≈çtara, the Pouakani Tree, near Pureora in the central North Island is over 35 meters tall and nearly 4 meters in trunk diameter at breast height. Bushmen discovered it in 1950. Other large trees are known in this area, while Whirinaki forest, to the east, but also on deep recent volcanic soils, has groves of very tall t≈çtara (over 40m in height). T≈çtara is often found regenerating on farmland as it is not eaten by livestock.  Varieties  There are two varieties of t≈çtara: * Podocarpus totara var. totara * Podocarpus totara var. waihoensis Related trees In a classic example of Antarctic flora species-pair the t≈çtara is very closely related to Podocarpus nubigenus from South America, to the extent that if planted together, they are very difficult to distinguish. The best distinction is the grey-green tone of the leaves, compared to the slightly brighter green of P. nubigenus. Cultivation Trunk of a t≈çtara tree (Podocarpus totara) in Prouse Bush, Levin, New Zealand T≈çtara grows easily from fresh seed and cuttings. It has been planted in the United Kingdom as far north as Inverewe, Scotland. Several cultivars for garden use have been introduced. These include 'Albany Gold' and 'Aurea', both have which have yellow gold foliage that darkens in winter; 'Pendula', which has a weeping growth habit that is especially pronounced in young plants; 'Silver Falls', also pendulous but with cream-edged foliage; and 'Matapouri Blue', which has a conical form and glaucous foliage. Human use The wood is hard, straight- grained and very resistant to rot, especially its heartwood. Due to its durability, t≈çtara wood was often used for fence posts, floor pilings and railway sleepers. It is also prized for its carving properties, and was the primary wood used in MƒÅori carving. It was the primary wood used to make waka in traditional Maori boat building due to its relatively light weight (about 25% lighter than kauri), long straight lengths and natural oils in the wood which help prevent rotting. T≈çtara could be drilled with chert points to make holes near the edges of the timber without splitting. In larger t≈çtara waka, three or more sections were laced together with flax rope. A t≈çtara waka took at least a year to make using stone adzes. Bark from t≈çtara is used to cover and protect traditional p≈çhƒÅ bags.

Smolin's 2006 book The Trouble with Physics criticized string theory as a viable scientific theory. He has made contributions to quantum gravity theory, in particular the approach known as loop quantum gravity. He advocates that the two primary approaches to quantum gravity, loop quantum gravity and string theory, can be reconciled as different aspects of the same underlying theory. His research interests also include cosmology, elementary particle theory, the foundations of quantum mechanics, and theoretical biology.Smolin's faculty page , Perimeter Institute. Early life Smolin was born in New York City. His brother, David M. Smolin, became a professor in the Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, Alabama. Education and career Smolin dropped out of Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was educated at Hampshire College. He received his Ph.D in theoretical physics from Harvard University in 1979. He held postdoctoral research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara and the University of Chicago, before becoming a faculty member at Yale, Syracuse and Pennsylvania State Universities. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1995 and a visiting professor at Imperial College London (1999-2001) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the Perimeter Institute in 2001. Theories and work =Loop quantum gravity= Smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity (LQG) in collaborative work with Ted Jacobson, Carlo Rovelli, Louis Crane, Abhay Ashtekar and others. LQG is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge field theories, which allows the use of techniques from particle physics, particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops. With Rovelli he discovered the discreteness of areas and volumes and found their natural expression in terms of a discrete description of quantum geometry in terms of spin networks. In recent years he has focused on connecting LQG to phenomenology by developing implications for experimental tests of spacetime symmetries as well as investigating ways elementary particles and their interactions could emerge from spacetime geometry. =Background independent approaches to string theory= Between 1999 and 2002, Smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models. =Experimental tests of quantum gravity= Smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the effects of quantum gravity can be experimentally probed by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena. These include very high energy cosmic rays and photons and neutrinos from gamma ray bursts. Among Smolin's contributions are the coinvention of doubly special relativity (with Jo√£o Magueijo, independently of work by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia) and of relative locality (with Amelino-Camelia, Laurent Freidel and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman). =Foundations of quantum mechanics= Smolin has worked since the early 1980s on a series of proposals for hidden variables theories, which would be non- local deterministic theories which would give a precise description of individual quantum phenomena. In recent years, he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time, called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence. =Cosmological natural selection = Smolin's hypothesis of cosmological natural selection, also called the fecund universes theory, suggests that a process analogous to biological natural selection applies at the grandest of scales. Smolin published the idea in 1992 and summarized it in a book aimed at a lay audience called The Life of the Cosmos. Black holes have a role in natural selection. In fecund theory a collapsing black hole causes the emergence of a new universe on the \\"other side\\", whose fundamental constant parameters (masses of elementary particles, Planck constant, elementary charge, and so forth) may differ slightly from those of the universe where the black hole collapsed. Each universe thus gives rise to as many new universes as it has black holes. The theory contains the evolutionary ideas of \\"reproduction\\" and \\"mutation\\" of universes, and so is formally analogous to models of population biology. When Smolin published the theory in 1992, he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun. Later this figure was raised to two solar masses following more precise modeling of neutron star interiors by nuclear astrophysicists. Smolin also predicted that inflation, if true, must only be in its simplest form, governed by a single field and parameter. Both predictions have held up, and they demonstrate Smolin's main thesis: that the theory of cosmological natural selection is Popper falsifiable. =Contributions to the philosophy of physics= Smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational, or Leibnizian, view of space and time. Since 2006, he has collaborated with the Brazilian philosopher and Harvard Law School professor Roberto Mangabeira Unger on the issues of the reality of time and the evolution of laws; in 2014 they published a book, its two parts being written separately.Smolin L., and Roberto Mangabeira Unger R., (2014), The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, A book length exposition of Smolin's philosophical views appeared in April 2013. Time Reborn argues that physical science has made time unreal while, as Smolin insists, it is the most fundamental feature of reality: \\"Space may be an illusion, but time must be real\\" (p. 179). An adequate description according to him would give a Leibnizian universe: indiscernibles would not be admitted and every difference should correspond to some other difference, as the principle of sufficient reason would have it. A few months later a more concise text was made available in a paper with the title Temporal Naturalism. Smolin L., arXiv:1310.8539 The Trouble with Physics Smolin's 2006 book The Trouble with Physics explored the role of controversy and disagreement in the progress of science. It argued that science progresses fastest if the scientific community encourages the widest possible disagreement among trained and accredited professionals prior to the formation of consensus brought about by experimental confirmation of predictions of falsifiable theories. He proposed that this meant the fostering of diverse competing research programs, and that premature formation of paradigms not forced by experimental facts can slow the progress of science. As a case study, The Trouble with Physics focused on the issue of the falsifiability of string theory due to the proposals that the anthropic principle be used to explain the properties of our universe in the context of the string landscape. The book was criticized by the physicists Joseph PolchinskiJoseph Polchinski (2007) \\"All Strung Out?\\" a review of The Trouble with Physics and Not Even Wrong, American Scientist 95(1):1. and other string theorists. In his earlier book Three Roads to Quantum Gravity (2002), Smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives. In that book, he also favored the holographic principle. The Trouble with Physics, on the other hand, was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics, which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches. Smolin suggests that string theory suffers from serious deficiencies and has an unhealthy near-monopoly in the particle theory community. He called for a diversity of approaches to quantum gravity, and argued that more attention should be paid to loop quantum gravity, an approach Smolin has devised. Finally, The Trouble with Physics is also broadly concerned with the role of controversy and the value of diverse approaches in the ethics and process of science. In the same year that The Trouble with Physics was published, Peter Woit published a book for nonspecialists whose conclusion was similar to Smolin's, namely that string theory was a fundamentally flawed research program. Views Smolin's view on the nature of time: > More and more, I have the feeling that quantum theory and general relativity > are both deeply wrong about the nature of time. It is not enough to combine > them. There is a deeper problem, perhaps going back to the beginning of > physics.Smolin, Lee. The Trouble With Physics, Houghton Mifflin Co, New > York, 2006. (p. 256) Smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a \\"final theory\\": > I am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory. I believe this > because I have never encountered an interpretation of the present > formulation of quantum mechanics that makes sense to me. I have studied most > of them in depth and thought hard about them, and in the end I still can't > make real sense of quantum theory as it stands.Smolin's response to the > question \\"What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it?\\" > \\"World Question Center 2005: Lee Smolin\\" Edge In a 2009 article, Smolin has articulated the following philosophical views (the sentences in italics are quotations): *There is only one universe. There are no others, nor is there anything isomorphic to it. Smolin denies the existence of a \\"timeless\\" multiverse. Neither other universes nor copies of our universe‚Äîwithin or outside‚Äîexist. No copies can exist within the universe, because no subsystem can model precisely the larger system it is a part of. No copies can exist outside the universe, because the universe is by definition all there is. This principle also rules out the notion of a mathematical object isomorphic in every respect to the history of the entire universe, a notion more metaphysical than scientific. *All that is real is real in a moment, which is a succession of moments. Anything that is true is true of the present moment. Not only is time real, but everything that is real is situated in time. Nothing exists timelessly. *Everything that is real in a moment is a process of change leading to the next or future moments. Anything that is true is then a feature of a process in this process causing or implying future moments. This principle incorporates the notion that time is an aspect of causal relations. A reason for asserting it, is that anything that existed for just one moment, without causing or implying some aspect of the world at a future moment, would be gone in the next moment. Things that persist must be thought of as processes leading to newly changed processes. An atom at one moment is a process leading to a different or a changed atom at the next moment. *Mathematics is derived from experience as a generalization of observed regularities, when time and particularity are removed. Under this heading, Smolin distances himself from mathematical platonism, and gives his reaction to Eugene Wigner's \\"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\\". Smolin views rejecting the idea of a creator as essential to cosmology on similar grounds to his objections against the multiverse. He does not definitively exclude or reject religion or mysticism but rather believes that science should only deal with that of which is observable. He also opposes the anthropic principle, which he claims \\"cannot help us to do science.\\"Scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle, July 2004 He also advocates \\"principles for an open future\\" which he claims underlie the work of both healthy scientific communities and democratic societies: \\"(1) When rational argument from public evidence suffices to decide a question, it must be considered to be so decided. (2) When rational argument from public evidence does not suffice to decide a question, the community must encourage a diverse range of viewpoints and hypotheses consistent with a good- faith attempt to develop convincing public evidence.\\" (Time Reborn p 265.)

He is a major figure in English-language haiku, known for his wry, poignant observations. Life In 1947, Swede arrived with his mother and stepfather from post-WW II Europe to live with his maternal grandparents on a fruit farm in Oyama, British Columbia and, when his stepfather died in 1950, Swede moved with his mother to Vancouver where he finished junior high and high school., Swede, G. Tracks in the Sand: Why Do We Write? pp. 56-61 Then he studied at the University of British Columbia, where he graduated with a B.A. in Psychology in 1964. After that, he worked briefly as a psychologist at B.C. Penitentiary in New Westminster. In 1965, he got an M.A. at Dalhousie University. From 1966 to 1967, Swede was a psychology instructor at Vancouver City College, after which he worked as a school psychologist at the Scarborough Board of Education in Toronto until 1968. He resumed his academic career at Ryerson University, where he stayed as member of the psychology department from 1968 to 2006 (as chair from 1998 to 2003). From 1970 to 1975 he served as Director for Developmental Psychology at Ryerson Open College, a virtual university which broadcast lectures by radio (on CJRT-FM) and TV (CBC and CTV) from 1970 to 1975; and from 1993 to 2000 he was engaged in Ryerson University Now (RUN), an initiative to get bright but disadvantaged students interested in going to university. This was achieved by enrolling Vaughan Road Academy studentsGood News At Vaughan Road Academy in a university level introductory psychology course that Swede taught.

Initially a clone of the System V.4 variant of the Bourne shell, it replaced the original Bourne shell in the BSD versions of Unix released in the early 1990s. History ash was first released via a posting to the Usenet news group, approved and moderated by Rich Salz on 30 May 1989. It was described as \\"a reimplementation of the System V shell [with] most features of that shell, plus some additions\\". Fast, small, and virtually compatible with the POSIX standard's specification of the Unix shell, ash did not provide line editing or command history mechanisms, because Almquist felt that such functionality should be moved into the terminal driver. However, current variants support it. The following is extracted from the ash package information from Slackware v14: Myriad forks have been produced from the original ash release. These derivatives of ash are installed as the default shell (\`/bin/sh\`) on FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, MINIX, and in some Linux distributions. MINIX 3.2 used the original ash version, whose test feature differed from POSIX. That version of the shell was replaced in MINIX 3.3. Android used ash until Android 4.0, at which point it switched to mksh. dash  In 1997 Herbert Xu ported \`ash\` from NetBSD to Debian Linux. In September 2002, with release 0.4.1, this port was renamed to \`dash\` (Debian Almquist shell). Xu's main priorities are POSIX conformance and slim implementation. Like its predecessor, dash implements support for neither Internationalization and localization nor multi-byte character encoding (both required in POSIX). Line editing and history support based on GNU Readline is optional (). = Adoption in Debian and Ubuntu = Because of its slimness, Ubuntu decided to adopt the dash as the default \`/bin/sh\` in 2006. The reason for using dash is faster shell script execution, especially during startup of the operating system, compared to previous versions of Debian and Ubuntu that used bash for this purpose, although bash is still the default login shell for interactive use. Dash became the default \`/bin/sh\` in Ubuntu starting with the 6.10 release in October 2006. Dash replaced ash and became the default \`/bin/sh\` in Debian 6 (Squeeze). A result of the shift is that many shell scripts were found making use of bash-specific functionalities (\\"bashisms\\") without properly declaring it in the shebang line. The problem was first spotted in Ubuntu and the Ubuntu maintainers decided to make all the scripts comply with the POSIX standard. The changes were later upstreamed to Debian, which soon adopted dash as its default too. As a result, all scripts in Debian and Ubuntu are guaranteed to be POSIX- compilant, save for the extensions merged into for convenience (, , ).

It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \\"classic\\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll.The American Heritage¬Æ Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ¬©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. The term \\"rockabilly\\" itself is a portmanteau of \\"rock\\" (from \\"rock 'n' roll\\") and \\"hillbilly\\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \\"hillbilly music\\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie-woogie, jump blues, and electric blues. Defining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, vocal twangs, and common use of the tape echo; but progressive addition of different instruments and vocal harmonies led to its \\"dilution\\". Initially popularized by artists such as Wanda Jackson, Billy Adams, Johnny Cash, Bill Haley, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Bob Luman, Eddie Cochran, and Jerry Lee Lewis, the rockabilly style waned in the late 1950s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a revival. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within musical subcultures. Rockabilly has left a legacy, spawning a variety of sub-styles and influencing other genres such as punk rock. Origins There was a close relationship between blues and country music from the very earliest country recordings in the 1920s. The first nationwide country hit was \\"Wreck of the Old 97\\", backed with \\"Lonesome Road Blues\\", which also became quite popular. Jimmie Rodgers, the \\"first true country star\\", was known as the \\"Blue Yodeler\\", and most of his songs used blues-based chord progressions, although with very different instrumentation and sound from the recordings of his black contemporaries like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Bessie Smith.Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music by Greil Marcus 1982 E.P. Dutton p.291 During the 1930s and 1940s, two new sounds emerged. Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys were the leading proponents of Western Swing, which combined country singing and steel guitar with big band jazz influences and horn sections; Wills's music found massive popularity. Recordings of Wills's from the mid 1940s to the early 1950s include \\"two beat jazz\\" rhythms, \\"jazz choruses\\", and guitar work that preceded early rockabilly recordings.San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. Page 289. Wills is quoted as saying \\"Rock and Roll? Why, man, that's the same kind of music we've been playin' since 1928!... But it's just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time. It's the same, whether you just follow a drum beat like in Africa or surround it with a lot of instruments. The rhythm's what's important.\\"San Antonio Rose: The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. Page 269. After blues artists like Meade Lux Lewis and Pete Johnson launched a nationwide boogie craze starting in 1938, country artists like Moon Mullican, the Delmore Brothers, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Speedy West, Jimmy Bryant, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose began recording what was known as \\"Hillbilly Boogie\\", which consisted of \\"hillbilly\\" vocals and instrumentation with a boogie bass line.Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock & Roll by Nick Tosches 1996 Da Capo Press The Maddox Brothers and Rose were at \\"the leading edge of rockabilly with the slapped bass that Fred Maddox had developed\\". Maddox said, \\"You've got to have somethin' they can tap their foot, or dance to, or to make 'em feel it.\\" After World War II the band shifted into higher gear leaning more toward a whimsical honky-tonk feel, with a heavy, manic bottom end - the slap bass of Fred Maddox. \\"They played hillbilly music but it sounded real hot. They played real loud for that time, too ...\\"Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. University of California Press. 1999. Pages 170, 171. . The Maddoxes were also known for their lively \\"antics and stuff\\". \\"We always put on a show ... I mean it just wasn't us up there pickin' and singing. There was something going on all the time.\\"Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. University of California Press. 1999. Page 170. . \\"... the demonstrative Maddoxes, helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively Maddoxes.\\"Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. University of California Press. 1999. Page 132. . Others believe that they were not only at the leading edge, but were one of the first Rockabilly groups, if not the first. Along with country, swing and boogie influences, jump blues artists such as Wynonie Harris and Roy Brown, and electric blues acts such as Howlin' Wolf, Junior Parker, and Arthur Crudup, influenced the development of rockabilly.Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music, page 912 The Memphis blues musician Junior Parker and his electric blues band, Little Junior's Blue Flames, featuring Pat Hare on the guitar, were a major influence on the rockabilly style, particularly with their songs \\"Love My Baby\\" and \\"Mystery Train\\" in 1953. Zeb Turner's February 1953 recording of \\"Jersey Rock\\" with its mix of musical styles, lyrics about music and dancing, and guitar solo, is another example of the mixing of musical genres in the first half of the 1950s. Bill Monroe is known as the Father of Bluegrass, a specific style of country music. Many of his songs were in blues form, while others took the form of folk ballads, parlor songs, or waltzes. Bluegrass was a staple of country music in the early 1950s and is often mentioned as an influence in the development of rockabilly.Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound by Robert Cantwell 1992 Da Capo Press The Honky Tonk sound, which \\"tended to focus on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity\\", also included songs of energetic, uptempo Hillbilly Boogie. Some of the better known musicians who recorded and performed these songs are: the Delmore Brothers, the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Merle Travis, Hank Williams, Hank Snow, and Tennessee Ernie Ford.\\"The Roots of Rock 'n' Roll 1946‚Äì1954\\" 2004 Universal Music Enterprises Curtis Gordon's 1953 \\"Rompin' and Stompin'\\", an uptempo hillbilly-boogie included the lyrics, \\"Way down south where I was born / They rocked all night 'til early morn' / They start rockin' / They start rockin' an rollin'.\\" =Tennessee= Carl Perkins Sharecroppers' sons Carl Perkins and his brothers Jay Perkins and Clayton Perkins, along with drummer W. S. Holland, had been playing their music roughly ninety miles from Memphis. The Perkins Brothers Band, featuring both Carl and Jay on lead vocals, quickly established themselves as the hottest band on the cutthroat, \\"get-hot-or-go-home\\" Jackson, Tennessee honky tonk circuit. Most of the requests for songs were for hillbilly songs that were delivered as jived up versions‚Äîclassic Hank Williams standards infused with a faster rhythm.The Rockabilly Legends: They Called It Rockabilly Long Before they Called It Rock and Roll by Jerry Naylor and Steve Halliday It was here that Carl started composing his first songs with an eye toward the future. Watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction, working out a more rhythmically driving style of music that was neither country nor blues, but had elements of both, Perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition, which would then be finally put to paper. Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that this strange new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. That would change in 1955 after recording the song \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" (recorded 19 December 1955) on Sam Phillips' Memphis-based Sun Records. Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard. =Memphis= In the early 1950s there was heavy competition among Memphis area bands playing an audience-savvy mix of covers, original songs, and hillbilly flavored blues. One source mentions both local disc jockey Dewey Phillips and Sam Phillips as being influential. Scotty Moore remembers that, \\"You could play ... As long as you could play, say, the top eight or ten songs from country, pop, R&B.; They didn't care what instruments you had, as long as people could dance.\\"The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. Pages 8, 9. The Saturday Night Jamboree The Saturday Night Jamboree was a local stage show held every Saturday night at the Goodwyn Institute Auditorium in downtown Memphis, Tennessee in 1953‚Äì54. But of more historical significance were the then-unknown artists who came to perform at the Jamboree. They include: Elvis Presley, Johnny and Dorsey Burnette, Eddie Bond, Charlie Feathers, Jim Cannon, Reggie Young, Barbara Pittman, the Lazenby Twins, Bud Deckleman, Harmonica Frank Floyd, Marcus Van Story, Lloyd Arnold, and more. The shows were sometimes broadcast on KWEM Radio Station in West Memphis, Arkansas by Joe Manuel, who fronted the Jamboree and was a KWEM personality. Every Saturday night in 1953, the dressing rooms backstage were a gathering place where musicians would come together and experiment with new sounds‚Äîmixing fast country, gospel, blues and boogie woogie. Guys were bringing in new \\"licks\\" that they had developed and were teaching them to other musicians and were learning new \\"licks\\" from yet other musicians backstage. Soon these new sounds began to make their way out onto the stage of the Jamboree where they found a very receptive audience. The Burnettes and Burlison Younger musicians around Memphis were beginning to play a mix of musical styles. Paul Burlison, for one, was playing in nondescript hillbilly bands in the very early 1950s. One of these early groups secured a fifteen-minute show on radio station KWEM in West Memphis, Arkansas. The time slot was adjacent to Howlin' Wolf's and the music quickly became a curious blend of blues, country and what would become known as rockabilly music. In 1951 and 1952 the Burnettes (Johnny and Dorsey) and Burlison played around Memphis and established a reputation for wild music. According to Burlison, \\"... when we started playing in 1951, we played an uptempo-style country beat with gospel, blues, and a little swing mixed in.\\"Billboard Apr 3, 1999. \\"Modern Rockabilly Reaches Back Decades for Its Roots\\". Page 89. They played with Doc McQueen's swing band at the Hideaway Club but hated the type of music played by \\"chart musicians.\\" Soon they broke away and began playing their energetic brand of rockabilly to small, but appreciative, local audiences. They wrote \\"Rock Billy Boogie,\\" named after Johnny's new baby boy Rocky Burnette and Dorsey's new son Billy, who were both born in 1953, while working at the Hideaway. Unfortunately for the Burnettes and Burlison, they did not record the song until 1957. The trio released \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" in 1956, listed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top 500 rock songs of all time, having been covered by the Yardbirds, Aerosmith, and many others. Many consider this 1956 recording to be the first intentional use of a distortion guitar on a rock song, which was played by lead guitarist Paul Burlison. Many rockabilly guitarists and historians now accept that on many of the classic recordings Johnny Burnette did in Nashville for Decca it was the legendary \\"A Team\\" of Grady Martin on guitar, Bob Moore on bass and Buddy Harmann on drums backing Johnny and Dorsey on vocals (the author of this comment has had discussions with Bob Moore where he confirms this). In all likelihood both Paul Burlison and Grady Martin played on some of the Nashville recordings, with who played what lost in the mists of time. The recordings done in the Pythian Temple in New York are undoubtedly all the work of Paul Burlison. The use of distortion on a rock'n'roll record was more accurately \\"Rocket 88\\" by Jackie Brenston and the Delta Cats. The legend of how the sound came about says that guitarist Willy Kizart's amplifier was damaged on Highway 61 when the band was driving from Mississippi to Memphis, Tennessee. An attempt was made to hold the cone in place by stuffing the amplifier with wadded newspapers, which unintentionally created a distorted sound; Phillips liked the sound and used it. Robert Palmer has written that the amplifier \\"had fallen from the top of the car\\", and attributes this information to Sam Phillips. However, in a recorded interview at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, Washington, Ike Turner stated that the amplifier was in the trunk of the car and that rain may have caused the damage; he is certain that it did not fall from the roof of the car. Elvis Presley Elvis Presley in a promotion shot for Jailhouse Rock in 1957 Presley's first recording, a blues song titled \\"That's All Right Mama\\", was previously recorded in 1946 by Arthur Crudup. In this recording Presley married \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" genres to an extent that it was denied airplay on (white) country radio stations and (black) R&B; stations, dismissed for being defined as both \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" music. Record Producer Sam Phillips was told by country deejays that Presley's \\"That's Alright Mama\\" was \\"black music\\" and lamented they would be \\"run out of town\\" for playing it. Similarly, R&B; deejays categorized it as a (white) country song. When the song was finally played by one rogue deejay, Dewey Phillips, Presley's recording created so much excitement it was described as having waged war on segregated radio stations. \\"The Sun recordings were the first salvos in an undeclared war on segregated radio stations nationwide.\\" All of Presley's early records combined a blues song on one side and a country song on the other, but both sung in the same vein. Presley's unique musical style rocketed him into the spotlight, and drew masses of followers: \\"But it's Presley's singing, halfway between a country western and a R&B; rock 'n' roll style that has sent teenagers into a trance. Whether you like it or not, there will always be an Elvis Presley.\\"Helen McNamara, June 9, 1956, Issue Saturday Night Magazine Presley's first, historical recordings took place at Sun Records, a small independent label run by Sam Phillips in Memphis, Tennessee. The historical significance of these first Presley recordings and their impact on future musical artists is well exemplified by the actions of legendary musical artist Bob Dylan, who is said to have gone to Sun Records and kissed the \\"x\\" where Elvis had stood to record his first recordings. Further stated by Dylan: \\"I thank God for Elvis Presley\\". For several years, Phillips had been recording and releasing performances by blues and country musicians in the area. He also ran a service allowing anyone to come in off the street and for $3.98 (plus tax) record himself on a two-song vanity record. One young man who came to record himself as a surprise for his mother, he claimed, was Elvis Presley.Newsweek August 18, 1997 \\"Good Rockin' page 54 According to Phillips, \\"Ninety-five percent of the people I had been working with were black, most of them of course no name people. Elvis fit right in. He was born and raised in poverty. He was around people that had very little in the way of worldly goods.\\"Elvis Presley Classic Albums DVD Eagle Eye Media EE19007 NTSC Presley made enough of an impression that Phillips deputized guitarist Scotty Moore, who then enlisted bassist Bill Black, both from the Starlight Wranglers, a local western swing band, to work with the green young Elvis.Newsweek August 18, 1997 \\"Good Rockin' page 55 The trio rehearsed dozens of songs, from traditional country, to \\"Harbor Lights\\", a hit for crooner Bing Crosby to gospel. During a break on July 5, 1954, Elvis \\"jumped up ... and started frailin' guitar and singin' \\"That's All Right, Mama\\" (a 1946 blues song by Arthur \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup). Scotty and Bill began playing along. Excited, Phillips told them to \\"back up and start from the beginning.\\" Two or three takes later, Phillips had a satisfactory recording, and released \\"That's All Right\\", on July 19, 1954, along with an \\"Elvis Presley Scotty and Bill\\" version of Bill Monroe's waltz, Blue Moon of Kentucky, a country standard. Presley's Sun recordings feature his vocals and rhythm guitar, Bill Black's percussive slapped bass, and Scotty Moore on an amplified guitar. Slap bass had been a staple of both Western Swing and Hillbilly Boogie since the 1940s. Commenting on his own guitar playing, Scotty Moore said, \\"All I can tell you is I just stole from every guitar player I heard over the years. Put it in my data bank. An' when I played that's just what come out.\\"Elvis Presley Classic Albums DVD by Eagle Eye Media EE19007 NTSC Peter Guralnick Scotty Moore described their first session, resulting in the recording of \\"That's Alright Mama\\": > We were taking a break and, all of sudden, Elvis started singing this song, > jumping around and acting the fool. Then Bill Black picked up his bass and > began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them.

Elvis sang the way Bill Black played bass.\\"Blue Moon Boys. page 17. Some have claimed that the sound of \\"That's Alright\\" was not entirely new, \\"It wasn't that they said 'I never heard anything like it before.' It wasn't as if this started a revolution, it galvanized a revolution. Not because Elvis had expressed something new, but he expressed something they had all been trying to express.\\" Sam Phillips indicated that for him it was a new sound, saying \\"It just broke me up\\". And many echo the sentiment that it was a sound like no other they had heard: \\"When I first heard Elvis singing 'That's Alright Mama'. The time just stood still. It knocked my socks off.\\" --Ramon Maupin. Nobody was sure what to call Presley's music, so Elvis was described as \\"The Hillbilly Cat\\" and \\"King of Western Bop.\\" Over the next year, Elvis would record four more singles for Sun. Rockabilly recorded by artists prior to Presley can be described as being in the long-standing country style of Rockabilly. Presley's recordings are described by some as quintessential rockabilly for their true union of country and R&B;, which can be described as the true realization of the Rockabilly genre. In addition to the fusion of distinct genres, Presley's recordings contain some traditional as well as new traits: \\"nervously up tempo\\" (as Peter Guralnick describes it), with slap bass, fancy guitar picking, much echo, shouts of encouragement, and vocals full of histrionics such as hiccups, stutters, and swoops from falsetto to bass and back again.Miller, Jim (editor). The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll (1976). New York: Rolling Stone Press/Random House. . (\\"Rockabilly,\\" chapter written by Guralnick, Peter. pp. 64‚Äì67)Sun Records: An Oral History by John Floyd 1998 Avon Books p. 29 By end of 1954 Elvis asked D.J. Fontana, who was the underutilized drummer for the Louisiana Hayride, \\"Would you go with us if we got any more dates?\\" Presley was now using drums,Newsweek August 18, 1997 \\"Good Rockin' page 57 as did many other rockabilly performers; drums were then uncommon in country music. In the 1956 sessions shortly after Presley's move from Sun Records to RCA, Presley was backed by a band that included Moore, Black, Fontana, and pianist Floyd Cramer. In 1956 Elvis also acquired vocal backup via the Jordanaires. =North of the Mason-Dixon Line= Bill Haley Bill Haley and His Comets during a TV appearance. In 1951 a western swing bandleader named Bill Haley recorded a version of \\"Rocket 88\\" with his group, the Saddlemen. It is considered one of the earliest recognized rockabilly recordings. Haley and his bandmates crafted a rockabilly sound during this period as the Saddlemen.Sh-Boom!: The Explosion of Rock 'n' Roll (1953‚Äì1968). Clay Cole, David Hinckley. (Bill Haley & the Saddlemen) at the Twin Bar in Gloucester, New Jersey. page 58. It was followed by versions of \\"Rock the Joint\\" in 1952, and original works such as \\"Real Rock Drive\\" and \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\", the latter of which reached number 12 on the American Billboard chart in 1953.Often excluded from lists of rockabilly groups, Comets guitarist Franny Beecher said, \\"They wanted to play a more basic style than I was used to, more country really, they called it rockabilly.\\" in Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. page 60. On April 12, 1954, Haley with his band (now known as Bill Haley and His Comets) recorded \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" for Decca Records of New York City. When first released in May 1954, \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" made the charts for one week at number 23, and sold 75,000 copies. A year later it was featured in the film Blackboard Jungle, and soon afterwards it was topping charts all over the world and opening up a new genre of entertainment. \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" hit No. 1, held that position for eight weeks, and was the number two song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 1955. The recording was, until the late 1990s, recognized by Guinness World Records as having the highest sales claim for a pop vinyl recording, with an \\"unaudited\\" claim of 25 million copies sold. Rock 'n' roll, an expansive term coined a couple years earlier by DJ Alan Freed, had now been to the pop mountaintop, a position it would never quite relinquish. Bill Flagg Maine native and Connecticut resident Bill Flagg began using the term rockabilly for his combination of rock 'n' roll and hillbilly music as early as 1953 He cut several songs for Tetra Records in 1956 and 1957. \\"Go Cat Go\\" went into the National Billboard charts in 1956, and his \\"Guitar Rock\\" is cited as classic rockabilly. Janis Martin on The Old Dominion Barn Dance Show In 1953 at the age of 13 Janis Martin was developing her own proto- rockabilly style on WRVA's Old Dominion Barn Dance, which broadcast out of Richmond, VA. Although Martin performed mostly country songs for the show, she also did songs by Rhythm and blues singers Ruth Brown and LaVern Baker, as well as a few Dinah Washington songs. \\"The audience didn't know what to make of it. They didn't hardly allow electric instruments, and I was doing some songs by black artists‚Äîstuff like Ruth Brown's \\"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean.\\" =Cash, Perkins and Presley= In 1954, both Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins auditioned for Sam Phillips. Cash hoped to record gospel music, but Phillips immediately nixed that idea. Cash did not return until 1955. In October 1954 Carl Perkins and \\"The Perkins Brothers Band\\" showed up at the Sun Studios. Phillips recorded Perkins's original song Movie Magg, which was released early March 1955 on Phillips's Flip label, which was all country. Presley's second and third records were not as successful as the first.Elvis Presley Classic Albums DVD by Eagle Eye Media EE19007 NTSC Ernst Jorgenen Historian and RCA producer The fourth release in May 1955 Baby, Let's Play House peaked at number five on the national Billboard Country Chart. The Sun label correctly lists \\"Gunter\\" (Arthur) as the songwriter, a song which he recorded in 1954. In 1951 Eddy Arnold recorded a song titled \\"I Want to Play House with You\\" by Cy Coben that sounds nothing like the Arthur Gunter song recorded by Presley. Cash returned to Sun in 1955 with his song Hey, Porter, and his group the Tennessee Three, who became the Tennessee Two before the session was over. This song and another Cash original, Cry! Cry! Cry! were released in July. Cry! Cry! Cry! managed to crack Billboard's Top 20, peaking at No. 14. In August Sun released Elvis's versions of \\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\\" and \\"Mystery Train\\". \\"Forgot ...\\", written by Sun country artists Stan Kesler and Charlie Feathers, spent a total of 39 weeks on the Billboard Country Chart, with five of those weeks at the number one spot. \\"Mystery Train\\", with writing credits for both Herman Little Junior Parker and Sam Phillips, peaked at number 11. Through most of 1955, Cash, Perkins, Presley, and other Louisiana Hayride performers toured through Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi. Sun released two more Perkins songs in October: \\"Gone, Gone, Gone\\" and \\"Let the Jukebox Keep on Playing\\". Scotty Moore commented on the different roles of Elvis and Perkins, \\"Carl was a nice- looking big hunk, like out in the cornfield type. Elvis was more like an Adonis. But as a rockabilly, Carl was the king of that.\\"The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 88. 1955 was also the year in which Chuck Berry's hillbilly-influenced Maybellene reached high in the charts as a crossover hit, and Bill Haley and His Comets' Rock Around the Clock was not only number one for eight weeks, but was the number two record for the year. Rock 'n' Roll in general, and rockabilly in particular, was at critical mass and the next year, Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel and Don't Be Cruel would top the Billboard Charts as well. =Rockabilly goes national: 1956= In January 1956 three new classic songs by Cash, Perkins, and Presley were released: \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" by Cash, and \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" by Perkins, both on Sun; and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" by Presley on RCA. Other rockabilly tunes released this month included \\"See You Later, Alligator\\" by Roy Hall and \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\" by the Commodores (no relation to the '70s Motown group). Perkins's \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" sold 20,000 records a day at one point, and it was the first million-selling country song to cross over to both rhythm and blues and pop charts. On February 11, Presley appeared on the Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show for the third time, singing \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" He performed \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" two more times on national television, and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" three times throughout 1956. Both songs topped the Billboard charts. Perkins first performed \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" on television March 17 on Ozark Jubilee, a weekly ABC-TV program. From 1955 to 1960, the live national radio and TV show from Springfield, Missouri featured Brenda Lee and Wanda Jackson and guests included Gene Vincent and other rockabilly artists. Sun and RCA weren't the only record companies releasing rockabilly music. In March Columbia released \\"Honky Tonk Man\\" by Johnny Horton, King put out \\"Seven Nights to Rock\\" by Moon Mullican, Mercury issued \\"Rockin' Daddy\\" by Eddie Bond, and Starday released Bill Mack's \\"Fat Woman\\". Carl Perkins, meanwhile, was involved in a major automobile accident on his way to appear on national television. Two young men from Texas made their record debuts in April 1956: Buddy Holly on the Decca label, and, as a member of the Teen Kings, Roy Orbison with \\"Ooby Dooby\\" on the New Mexico/Texas based Je-wel label. Holly's big hits would not be released until 1957. Janis Martin was all of fifteen years old when RCA issued a record with \\"Will You, Willyum\\" and the Martin composed \\"Drugstore Rock 'n' Roll\\", which sold over 750,000 copies. King records issued a new disk by forty-seven-year-old Moon Mullican: \\"Seven Nights to Rock\\" and \\"Rock 'N' Roll Mr. Bullfrog\\". Twenty more sides were issued by various labels including 4 Star, Blue Hen, Dot, Cold Bond, Mercury, Reject, Republic, Rodeo, and Starday. In April and May 1956, The Rock and Roll Trio played on Ted Mack's TV talent show in New York City. They won all three times and guaranteed them a finalist position in the September supershow. Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps' recording of \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" was released on June 2, 1956, backed by \\"Woman Love.\\" Within twenty-one days it sold over two hundred thousand records, stayed at the top of national pop and country charts for twenty weeks, and sold more than a million copies.The Rockabilly Legends; They Called It Rockabilly Long Before they Called It Rock and Roll by Jerry Naylor and Steve Halliday page 220 These same musicians would have two more releases in 1956, followed by another in January 1957. \\"Queen of Rockabilly\\" Wanda Jackson's first record came out in July, \\"I Gotta Know\\" on the Capitol label; followed by \\"Hot Dog That Made Him Mad\\" in November. Capitol would release nine more records by Jackson, some with songs she had written herself, before the 1950s were over. The first record by Jerry Lee Lewis came out on December 22, 1956 and featured the song \\"Crazy Arms\\" (which had been a #1 hit for Ray Price some twenty weeks earlier in the year) along with \\"End of the Road\\". Lewis would have big hits in 1957 with his version of \\"Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On\\", issued in May, and \\"Great Balls Of Fire\\" on Sun. =Additional performers and information= There were thousands of musicians who recorded songs in the rockabilly style. An online database lists 262 musicians with names beginning with \\"A\\". And many record companies released rockabilly records. Some enjoyed major chart success and were important influences on future rock musicians. Sun also hosted performers, such as Billy Lee Riley, Sonny Burgess, Charlie Feathers, and Warren Smith. There were also several female performers like Wanda Jackson who recorded rockabilly music long after the other ladies, Janis Martin, the female Elvis Jo Ann Campbell, and Alis Lesley, who also sang in the rockabilly style. Mel Kimbrough -\\"Slim\\", recorded \\"I Get Lonesome Too\\" and \\"Ha Ha, Hey Hey\\" for Glenn Records along with \\"Love in West Virginia\\" and \\"Country Rock Sound\\" for Checkmate a division of Caprice Records. Gene Summers, a Dallas native and Rockabilly Hall of Fame inductee, released his classic Jan/Jane 45s in 1958‚Äì59. He continued to record rockabilly music well into 1964 with the release of \\"Alabama Shake\\". In 2005, Summers's most popular recording, School of Rock 'n Roll, was selected by Bob Solly and Record Collector Magazine as one of the \\"100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Records\\".Solly, Bob. (2005). 100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Records. Diamond Publishing Company LTD, UK. -02. UPC 9-771746805006. Tommy Sleepy LaBeef (LaBeff) recorded rockabilly tunes on a number of labels from 1957 through 1963. Rockabilly pioneers the Maddox Brothers and Rose, both as a group, and with Rose as a solo act, added onto their two decades of performing by making records that were even more rocking. However, none of these artists had any major hits and their influence would not be felt until decades later.Morrison, Craig. Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and its Makers. (1996). Illinois. University of Illinois Press. In the summer of 1958 Eddie Cochran had a chart-topping hit with \\"Summertime Blues\\". Cochran's brief career included only a few more hits, such as \\"Sitting in the Balcony\\" released in early 1957, \\"C'mon Everybody\\" released in October 1958, and \\"Somethin' Else\\" released in July 1959. Then in April 1960, while touring with Gene Vincent in the UK, their taxi crashed into a concrete lamp post, killing Eddie at the young age of 21. The grim coincidence in this all was that his posthumous UK number-one hit was called \\"Three Steps to Heaven\\". Rockabilly music enjoyed great popularity in the United States during 1956 and 1957, but radio play declined after 1960. Factors contributing to this decline are usually cited as the 1959 death of Buddy Holly in an airplane crash (along with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper), the induction of Elvis Presley into the army in 1958, and a general change in American musical tastes. The style remained popular longer in England, where it attracted a fanatical following right up through the mid-1960s. Rockabilly music cultivated an attitude that assured its enduring appeal to teenagers. This was a combination of rebellion, sexuality, and freedom‚Äîa sneering expression of disdain for the workaday world of parents and authority figures. It was the first rock ‚Äòn' roll style to be performed primarily by white musicians, thus setting off a cultural revolution that is still reverberating today.Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock ‚Äòn' Roll Music by Greil Marcus 1982 E.P. Dutton pp. 154‚Äì156, 169 \\"Rockabilly\\" deviance from social norms, however, was more symbolic than real; and eventual public professions of faith by aging rockabillies were not uncommon.Don't Get Above Your Raisin, p. 79, Bill C. Malone, 2002, University of Illinois Press, Use of the term \\"rockabilly\\" In an interview that can be viewed at the Experience Music Project, Barbara Pittman states that, \\"It was so new and it was so easy. It was a three chord change. Rockabilly was actually an insult to the southern rockers at that time. Over the years it has picked up a little dignity. It was their way of calling us 'hillbillies'.\\" One of the first written uses of the term rockabilly was in a June 23, 1956, Billboard review of Ruckus Tyler's \\"Rock Town Rock\\". Three weeks earlier, rockabilly was used in a press release describing Gene Vincent's \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\".Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers. Craig Morrison. 1996. University of Illinois Press. page 3. The first record to contain the word rockabilly in a song title was issued in November 1956 \\"Rock a Billy Gal\\"; although, Johnny and Dorsey Burnette recorded \\"Rock Billy Boogie\\" for the Coral label on July 4, 1956. The song had been written and performed much earlier, and refer to the birth of Johnny's son Rocky and Dorsey's son Billy, who were born around the same time in 1953, and were firstborns for each of the brothers. The song was part of their repertoire in 1956 when they were living in New York City and performing with Gene Vincent. It's easy to understand how the New York audience might have thought the Burnettes were singing \\"Rockabilly Boogie,\\" but they never would, because the term hillbilly was derogatory and would never have been used by the artists themselves. Rocky Burnette, who later would become a rockabilly artist himself, has stated on his website that the term rockabilly derives from that song. It's also interesting that this song has been covered by hundreds of artists in the years since, and it is always called \\"Rockabilly Boogie\\". The lyrics of rockabilly boogie would suggest that it has nothing to do with the birth of their sons. One verse goeshttps://genius.com/Johnny- burnette-rock-billy-boogie-lyrics: Well, there's little ol' Suzie, turnin' seventeen Well, everybody knows her as a rockabilly queen And there's Ol' Slim, as quiet as a mouse He grabs Ol' Suzie, they'll tear up the house Recording techniques Slapback, slapback echo, flutter echo, tape delay echo, echo, and reverb are some of the terms used to describe one particular aspect of rockabilly recordings. The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records such as \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" (April 12, 1954, released May 15) by Bill Haley & His Comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca's studio in New York, located in a former ballroom called The Pythian Temple. It was a big, barn-like building with great echo. This same facility would also be used to record other rockabilly musicians such as Buddy Holly and The Rock and Roll Trio. In Memphis Sam Phillips used various techniques to create similar acoustics at his Memphis Recording Services Studio. The shape of the ceiling, corrugated tiles, and the setup of the studio were augmented by \\"slap-back\\" tape echo which involved feeding the original signal from one tape machine through a second machine. The echo effect had been used, less subtly, on Wilf Carter Victor records of the 1930s, and in Eddy Arnold's 1945 \\"Cattle Call\\".Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock 'n' Roll. Nick Tosches. 1977. 1985. DeCapo Press. Page 58. According to Cowboy Jack Clement, who took over production duties from Sam Phillips, \\"There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, it goes to the playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything.\\"The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. Page 39. In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.Rock & Roll: An Unruly History (1995) Robert Palmer page 202 When Elvis Presley left Phillips' Sun Records and recorded \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" for RCA, the RCA producers placed microphones at the end of a hallway to achieve a similar effect. A comparison of rockabilly versions of country songs shows that while form, lyrics, chord progressions and arrangements are simplified and with sparser instrumentation, a fuller sound was achieved by more percussive playing‚Äîi.e., subdivisions of the beat receive more emphasis. Tempos were increased, texts are altered with deletions, additions, more intense, flamboyant loose singing, along with variation in melody from verse to verse.Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers. Craig Morrison. 1952. University of Illinois Press. page 30. Influence on the Beatles and the British Invasion The first wave of rockabilly fans in the United Kingdom were called Teddy Boys because they wore long, Edwardian-style frock coats, along with tight black drainpipe trousers and brothel creeper shoes. Another group in the 1950s that were followers of rockabilly were the Ton-Up boys, who rode British motorcycles and would later be known as rockers in the early 1960s. The rockers had adopted the classic greaser look of T-shirts, jeans, and leather jackets to go with their heavily slicked pompadour haircuts. The rockers loved 1950s rock and roll artists such as Gene Vincent, and some British rockabilly fans formed bands and played their own version of the music. The most notable of these bands was The Beatles. When John Lennon first met Paul McCartney, he was impressed that McCartney knew all the chords and the words to Eddie Cochran's \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\". As the band became more professional and began playing in Hamburg, they took on the \\"Beatle\\" name (inspired by Buddy Holly's Crickets Miles, Barry, Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now, Henry Holt and Company, New York, 1997 p. 52) and they adopted the black leather look of Gene Vincent. Musically, they combined Holly's melodic songwriting sensibility with the rough rock and roll sound of Vincent and Carl Perkins. When The Beatles became worldwide stars, they released versions of three different Carl Perkins songs, more than any other songwriter outside the band, except Larry Williams, who also added three songs to their discography. (Curiously, none of these three were sung by the Beatles' regular lead vocalists‚Äî\\"Honey Don't\\" (sung by Ringo) and \\"Everybody's Trying to be my Baby\\" (sung by George) from Beatles for Sale (1964) and \\"Matchbox\\" (sung by Ringo) on the Long Tall Sally EP (1964)). Long after the band broke up, the members continued to show their interest in rockabilly. In 1975, Lennon recorded an album called Rock 'n' Roll, featuring versions of rockabilly hits and a cover photo showing him in full Gene Vincent leather. About the same time, Ringo Starr had a hit with a version of Johnny Burnette's \\"You're Sixteen\\". In the 1980s, McCartney recorded a duet with Carl Perkins, and George Harrison collaborated with Roy Orbison in the Traveling Wilburys. In 1999, McCartney released Run Devil Run, his own record of rockabilly covers.Shout!: The Beatles in Their Generation by Phillip Norman 1981 MJF Books The Beatles were not the only British Invasion artists influenced by rockabilly. The Rolling Stones recorded Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\" on an early single and later a rockabilly-style song, \\"Rip This Joint\\", on Exile on Main St. The Who, despite being mod favourites, covered Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\" and Johnny Kidd and The Pirates' Shakin' All Over on their Live at Leeds album. Even heavy guitar heroes such as Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page were influenced by rockabilly musicians. Beck recorded his own tribute album to Gene Vincent's guitarist Cliff Gallup‚ÄîCrazy Legs‚Äîand Page's band, Led Zeppelin, offered to work as Elvis Presley's backing band in the 1970s. However, Presley never took them up on that offer.Elvis: The Illustrated Record by Roy Carr and Mick Farren 1982 Harmony Books p. 160 Years later, Led Zeppelin's Page and Robert Plant recorded a tribute to the music of the 1950s called The Honeydrippers: Volume One. Rockabilly revival: 1970‚Äì90 Gazzguzzlers use the classic instruments associated with rockabilly: a hollow-body guitar, and upright bass, and a pared-down drum kit. The 1968 Elvis \\"comeback\\" and acts such as Sha Na Na, Creedence Clearwater Revival, John Roman Jackson, Don McLean, Linda Ronstadt and the Everly Brothers, the film American Graffiti, the television show Happy Days and the Teddy Boy revival created curiosity about the real music of the 1950s, particularly in England, where a rockabilly revival scene began to develop from the 1970s in record collecting and clubs.Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock ‚Äòn' Roll Music by Greil Marcus 1982 E.P. Dutton pp. 147‚Äì150Rockabilly: A Forty Year Journey by Billy Poore 1998 Hal Leonard Publishing pp. 157‚Äì79. The most successful early product of the scene was Dave Edmunds, who joined up with songwriter Nick Lowe to form a band called Rockpile in 1975. They had a string of minor rockabilly-style hits like \\"I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock 'n' Roll)\\". The group became a popular touring act in the UK and the US, leading to respectable album sales. Edmunds also nurtured and produced many younger artists who shared his love of rockabilly, most notably the Stray Cats.Miller, Jim (editor). The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll. (1976). New York: Rolling Stone Press/Random House. . pp. 437‚Äì8. Robert Gordon emerged from late 1970s CBGB punk act Tuff Darts to reinvent himself as a rockabilly revival solo artist. He recorded first with 1950s guitar legend Link Wray and later with UK studio guitar veteran Chris Spedding and found borderline mainstream success. Also festering at CBGB's punk environs were The Cramps, who combined primitive and wild rockabilly sounds with lyrics inspired by old drive-in horror movies in songs like \\"Human Fly\\" and \\"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\\". Lead singer Lux Interior's energetic and unpredictable live shows attracted a fervent cult audience. Their \\"psychobilly\\" music influenced The Meteors and Reverend Horton Heat. In the early '80s, the Latin genre was born in Colombia by Marco T (Marco Tulio Sanchez), with The Gatos Monta√±eros.The Rolling Stone Review 1985 Edited by Ira Robbins 1985 Rolling Stone Press/Charles Scribner's Sons New York p. 89. The Polecats, from North London, were originally called The Cult Heroes; they couldn't get any gigs at rockabilly clubs with a name that sounded \\"punk\\", so the original drummer Chris Hawkes came up with the name \\"Polecats\\". Tim Polecat and Boz Boorer started playing together in 1976, then hooked up with Phil Bloomberg and Chris Hawkes at the end of 1977. The Polecats played rockabilly with a punk sense of anarchy and helped revive the genre for a new generation in the early 1980s. In 1980, Queen scored a number- one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with the rockabilly-inspired single \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\".Lights! Action! Sound! It's That Crazy Little Thing Called Queen Circus Magazine. Retrieved 29 June 2011 The Stray Cats were the most commercially successful of the new rockabilly artists. The band formed on Long Island in 1979 when Brian Setzer teamed up with two school chums calling themselves Lee Rocker and Slim Jim Phantom. Attracting little attention in New York, they flew to London in 1980, where they had heard that there was an active rockabilly scene. Early shows were attended by the Rolling Stones and Dave Edmunds, who quickly ushered the boys into a recording studio. The Stray Cats had three UK Top Ten singles to their credit and two best-selling albums. They returned to the US, performing on the TV show Fridays with a message flashing across the screen that they had no record deal in the States. Soon EMI picked them up, their first videos appeared on MTV, and they stormed up the charts stateside. Their third LP, Rant 'N' Rave with the Stray Cats, topped charts across the US and Europe as they sold-out shows everywhere during 1983. However, personal conflicts led the band to break up at the height of their popularity. Brian Setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles, while Rocker and Phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly. The group has reconvened several times to make new records or tours and continue to attract large audiences live, although record sales have never again approached their early '80s success.Rockabilly: A Forty Year Journey by Billy Poore 1998 Hal Leonard Publishing pp. 223‚Äì6. The Jime entered the rockabilly scene in 1983, when Vince Gordon formed his band. The Jime was a Danish Band. The Jime was the band of Vince Gordon, rockabilly guitarist. Not only was he the nerve of the band. Vince Gordon was the band. He composed nearly all its songs and hits. Vince Gordon also left his mark on the rockabilly scene in many ways. Expert Fred Sokolow talks about the Vince Gordon style in Rockabilly due to his composing. Vince Gordon had many different musicians in his band. The lifetime of the Jime ended with the dead of Vince Gordon in 2016. Shakin' Stevens was a Welsh singer who gained fame in the UK portraying Elvis in a stage play. In 1980, he took a cover of The Blasters' \\"Marie Marie\\" into the UK Top 20. His hopped-up versions of songs like \\"This Ole House\\" and \\"Green Door\\" were giant sellers across Europe. Shakin' Stevens was the biggest selling singles artist of the 1980s in the UK and number two across Europe, outstripping Michael Jackson, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen. Despite his popularity in Europe, he never became popular in the US. In 2005, his greatest hits album topped the charts in England.Rockabilly: A Forty Year Journey by Billy Poore 1998 Hal Leonard Publishing pp. 176‚Äì8. Other notable British rockabilly bands of the 1980s included The Jets, Crazy Cavan, Matchbox, and the Rockats. Jason & the Scorchers combined heavy metal, Chuck Berry and Hank Williams to create a punk-influenced style of rockabilly, often labelled as alt-country or cowpunk. They achieved critical acclaim and a following in America but never managed a major hit.I. Robbins, The Rolling Stone Review 1985 (Rolling Stone Press/Charles Scribner's Sons New York, 1985), pp. 193‚Äì4. The revival was related to the \\"roots rock\\" movement, which continued through the 1980s, led by artists like James Intveld, who later toured as lead guitar for The Blasters, High Noon, the Beat Farmers, The Paladins, Forbidden Pigs, Del- Lords, Long Ryders, The Last Wild Sons, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Los Lobos, The Fleshtones, Del Fuegos, Reverend Horton Heat and Barrence Whitfield and the Savages. These bands, like the Blasters, were inspired by a full range of historic American styles: blues, country, rockabilly, R&B; and New Orleans jazz. They held a strong appeal for listeners who were tired of the commercially oriented MTV-style synthpop and glam metal bands that dominated radio play during this time period, but none of these musicians became major stars.I. Robbins, The Rolling Stone Review 1985 (Rolling Stone Press/Charles Scribner's Sons New York, 1985) pp. 172‚Äì5. In 1983, Neil Young recorded a rockabilly album titled Everybody's Rockin'. The album was not a commercial success and Young was involved in a widely publicized legal fight with Geffen Records who sued him for making a record that didn't sound \\"like a Neil Young record\\". Young made no further albums in the rockabilly style.Neil Young - MSN Encarta During the 1980s, a number of country music stars scored hits recording in a rockabilly style. Marty Stuart's \\"Hillbilly Rock\\" and Hank Williams, Jr.'s \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\\" were the most noteworthy examples of this trend, but they and other artists like Steve Earle and the Kentucky Headhunters charted many records with this approach.W. Poore, Rockabilly: A Forty Year Journey (Hal Leonard Publishing, 1998), pp. 267‚Äì70. Rockabilly dancers in Japan, 2016 Neo-rockabilly (1990‚Äìpresent) While not true rockabilly, many contemporary indie pop, blues rock, and country rock groups from the US, like Kings of Leon, Black Keys, Blackfoot, and the White Stripes, were heavily influenced by rockabilly. Morrissey adopted a rockabilly style during the early 1990s, being largely influenced by his guitarists Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte and working with former Fairground Attraction bass- guitarist and songwriter Mark E. Nevin. His rockabilly style was emphasised in the singles \\"Pregnant for the Last Time\\" and \\"Sing Your Life\\", as well as his second solo album and tour Kill Uncle. Irish rockabilly artist Imelda May has been partly responsible for a resurgence of European interest in the genre, scoring three successive number one albums in Ireland, with two of those also reaching the top ten in the UK charts. Drake Bell, a pop rock singer- songwriter and actor, revived rockabilly with his 2014 album, Ready Steady Go!, which was produced by Brian Setzer, frontman of the rockabilly revival band, The Stray Cats. The album peaked at #182 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 2,000 copies in its first week of release. The album received positive reviews from critics. Neo-rockabilly UK band Restless, played neo-rockabilly from the early 80s. The style was to mix any popular music to a rockabilly set up, drums, slap bass and guitar. This was followed by many other artists at the time in London. Today, bands like Lower The Tone are more aligned to neo- rockabilly that suits popular music venues instead of the dedicated rockabilly clubs that expect only original rockabilly. Rockabilly Hall of Fame The original Rockabilly Hall of Fame was established by Bob Timmers on March 21, 1997, to present early rock and roll history and information relative to the original artists and personalities involved in this pioneering American music genre. It is headquartered in Nashville. In 2000, an International Rock-A- Billy Hall of Fame Museum was established in Jackson, Tennessee.

He is widely considered one of the greatest pianists of the twentieth century. Life Arrau was born in Chill√°n, Chile, the son of Carlos Arrau, an ophthalmologist who died when Claudio was only a year old, and Lucrecia Le√≥n Bravo de Villalba, a piano teacher. He belonged to an old, prominent family of Southern Chile. His ancestor Lorenzo de Arrau, a Spanish engineer, was sent to Chile by King Carlos III of Spain. Through his great-grandmother, Mar√≠a del Carmen Daroch del Solar, Arrau was a descendant of the Campbells of Glenorchy, a Scottish noble family.Claudio Arrau (Piano) full ancestry to Campbells as well as Hapsburgs given here. Accessed via Internet November 22, 2016 Arrau was raised as a Catholic, but gave it up in his late teens.Joseph Horowitz, Arrau on Music and Performance Page 182 \\"Arrau was raised as a Catholic, but gave it up around the age of fifteen. 'I confessed only once, and thought it was absolutely ridiculous...(I) am not religious in any confessional sense. I think I have some mystical sensations. But I have no image of God as a person.'\\" Claudio Arrau, November 1929 Arrau was a child prodigy and he could read music before he could read words, but unlike many virtuosos, there had never been a professional musician in his family. His mother was an amateur pianist and introduced him to the instrument. At the age of 4 he was reading Beethoven sonatas, and he gave his first concert a year later. When Arrau was 6 he auditioned in front of several congressmen and President Pedro Montt, who was so impressed that he began arrangements for Arrau's future education. At age 8, Arrau was sent on a ten-year-long grant from the Chilean government to study in Germany, travelling with his mother and sister Lucrecia. He was admitted to the Stern Conservatory of Berlin where he eventually became a pupil of Martin Krause, who had studied under Franz Liszt. At the age of 11 Arrau could play Liszt's Transcendental Etudes, one of the most difficult works for piano, as well as Brahms's Paganini Variations. Arrau's first recordings were made on Aeolian Duo-Art player piano music rolls. Krause died in his fifth year of teaching Arrau, leaving the 15-year-old student devastated by the loss of his mentor; Arrau did not continue formal study after that point. In 1935, Arrau gave a celebrated rendition of the entire keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach over 12 recitals. In 1936, Arrau gave a complete Mozart keyboard works over 5 recitals, and followed with the complete Schubert and Weber cycles. In 1938, for the first time, Arrau gave the complete Beethoven piano sonatas and concertos in Mexico City. Arrau repeated this several times in his lifetime, including in New York and London. He became one of the leading authorities on Beethoven in the 20th century. In 1937, Arrau married mezzo-soprano Ruth Schneider (1908‚Äì1989), a German national. They had three children: Carmen (1938‚Äì2006), Mario (1940‚Äì1988) and Christopher (1959). In 1941 the Arrau family emigrated from Germany to the United States, eventually settling in Douglaston, Queens, New York, where Arrau spent his remaining years. He became a dual U.S.-Chilean citizen in 1979.\\"Douglas Manor:Notable residents ‚Äì Claudio Arrau, Pianist\\" , The Douglaston and Little Neck Historical Society, 2016, accessed June 5, 2017 Arrau died on June 9, 1991, at the age of 88, in M√ºrzzuschlag, Austria, from complications of emergency surgery performed on June 8 to correct an intestinal blockage.Joseph Horowitz, \\"Afterword\\" His remains were interred in his native city of Chill√°n, Chile. Tone and approach to music Daniel Barenboim said that Claudio Arrau had a particular sound with two aspects: first a thickness, full-bodied and orchestral, and second an utterly disembodied timbre, quite spellbinding. Sir Colin Davis said: \\"His sound is amazing, and it is entirely his own... no one else has it exactly that way. His devotion to Liszt is extraordinary. He ennobles that music in a way no one else in the world can.\\" According to American critic Harold C. Schonberg, Arrau always put \\"a decidedly romantic piano tone in his interpretations\\".Harold C. Schonberg, The Great Pianists from Mozart to the Present, Simon & Schuster, Second Edition (1987) Arrau was an intellectual and a deeply reflective interpreter. He read widely while travelling, and he learned English, Italian, German, and French in addition to his native Spanish. He became familiar with Jung's psychology in his twenties.Horowitz, J. (1999), Arrau on music and performance. Courier Dover Publications. Arrau's attitude toward music was very serious. He preached fidelity to the score, but also the use of imagination. Although he often played with slower and more deliberate tempi from his middle age onward, he had a reputation as a fabulous virtuoso earlier in his career, a reputation supported by recordings he made at this time, such as Balakirev's Islamey and Liszt's Paganini √©tudes. However, even late in his career, he often tended to play with less restraint in live concerts than in studio recordings. Arrau was a man of remarkable fortitude; even towards the end of his life he invariably programmed very large, demanding concerts, including works such as Beethoven's Emperor Concerto and Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1. Contributions Numerous pianists studied with Arrau, including Karlrobert Kreiten, Garrick Ohlsson, Roberto Szidon, Stephen Drury and Roberto Eyzaguirre among others. He was a frequent recital performer: from age 40 to 60 he averaged 120 concerts a season, with a very large repertoire. At one time or another, he performed the complete keyboard works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin; but also programmed such off-the-beaten-path composers as Alkan and Busoni and illuminated obscure corners of the Liszt repertoire. It has been estimated that Arrau's total repertoire would carry him through 76 recital evenings, not counting the 60-odd works with orchestra which he also knew. Arrau recorded a considerable part of the piano music of Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. He edited the complete Beethoven piano sonatas for the Peters Urtext edition and recorded all of them on the Philips label in 1962‚Äì1966. He recorded almost all of them once again in 1984-1990 along with Mozart's complete piano sonatas. He is also famous for his recordings of Schubert, Brahms and Debussy. Notable recordings: * Bach: Goldberg Variations (recorded in 1942), partitas 1,2,3 and 5 (recorded in 1991) * Beethoven: complete piano concertos (he recorded them three times) and piano sonatas * Brahms: complete piano concertos, piano sonatas 2 and 3 * Chopin: complete √âtudes, nocturnes, preludes and piano concertos * Debussy: complete preludes & images, Suite Bergamasque * Liszt: piano sonata in B minor, complete Transcendental √âtudes * Mozart: complete piano sonatas * Schoenberg: piano pieces, Op. 11 * Schubert: late piano sonatas, Impromptus, Klavierst√ºcke, D. 946 * Schumann: piano sonata in #F minor, Carnaval, Fantasia in C major, piano concerto in A minor (he recorded it four times) * Weber: piano sonata in C major, Konzertst√ºck, Op. 79 At the time of his death at age 88 in the midst of a European concert tour, Arrau was working on a recording of the complete works of Bach for keyboard, and was also preparing some pieces of Haydn, Mendelssohn, Reger and Busoni, and Boulez's third piano sonata. The Robert Schumann Society established the Arrau Medal in 1991. It has been awarded to Andr√°s Schiff, Martha Argerich and Murray Perahia. Critics *Olin Downes, reviewing a recital of Mozart, Schumann, Ravel and Debussy works in The New York Times, described Claudio Arrau as \\"a pianist of most exceptional equipment, imagination and unfailing taste.\\" *In 1963, according to various critics, he was a man with \\"no equal at the present time in point of technical stature and depth of musical imagination,\\" \\"the No. 1 pianist of our time,\\" a \\"pianistic titan,\\" a \\"lion of the piano,\\" or, if you like, a \\"neo-Liszt from the Tropic of Capricorn\\". *\\"Is it not Claudio Arrau who is the most musical and deeply serious piano phenomenon of our time?\\" ‚Äì Karl Schumann, Germany's leading music critic, in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung on June 2, 1986. *According to Joseph Horowitz: \\"His earliest recordings, extending into the forties, are his most mercurial, and are buffed with the glistening tonal refinements mentioned in his early New York reviews. His recorded performances of the following decade or so are more majestically placed; given room to maneuver, he is more likely to linger than to bolt. (...) Then, sometimes around 1960, the recordings document a different change. An emerging undercurrent of raw feeling note only dictates yet slower tempos and grander rubatos, but adds to the dignified architecture of Arrau's sound a steady projection of human frailty. (...) How did this change come about? (...) At the risk of resorting to cut-rate psychology, I am tempted to cite, as well, the event Arrau recalls as 'the greatest shock in my life\\": his mother's death in 1959. Perhaps mourning openend new emotional pathways. Perhaps the disappearance of a pervasive authority figure freed or emboldened him to make a more vulnerable statement in his art.\\" *John von Rhein wrote in 1991 in the Chicago Tribune: \\"He was among the least flamboyant of pianists, avoiding virtuosic display as rigorously as some pianists seek it out; yet there was never any doubt of his virtuoso technique. He commanded a rich sonority, each chord superbly weighted, the fingerwork a model of finely chiseled clarity, the shape of each phrase deeply considered. Sometimes Mr. Arrau's penchant for slow tempos and emphasis on inner detail could seem fussy, depriving his performances of spontaneity and momentum. At his considerable best, however, he was among the most deeply satisfying interpreters of Mozart, Brahms, Schumann, Liszt, Chopin and particularly Beethoven, whose works held a position in his repertoire comparable to that of his great colleague, pianist Rudolf Serkin. Quotes *\\"All I wanted was music,\\" Mr. Arrau once said of his early years. \\"I was even fed at the piano. Otherwise, it seems, I wouldn't eat. I used to play with my mouth open, and my mother put food in it.\\" *Describing his work in a 1975 interview, Mr. Arrau said: \\"I try to play the way a cat jumps. It must be completely natural. I have promised myself that whenever I feel a kind of routine creeping into my playing, I will stop. Now when I play I am almost in ecstasy, a creative ecstasy, which I wouldn't miss for anything. This is what I live for.\\" Awards and recognitions *2012: Voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame * 1990: Gold Medal of The Royal Philharmonic Society * 1988: La Medalla Teresa Carre√±o of Venezuela; Honorary Member of The Royal Philharmonic Society * 1984: The Highest Distinction Award from the Inter-American Music Council and the Organization of American States; Doctor Honoris Causa of Universidad de Concepci√≥n; Professor Honoris Causa of Universidad de B√≠o-B√≠o * 1983: The International UNESCO Music Prize; National de la L√©gion d'honneur of France; National Prize of Art of Chile; First Honorary Member of The Robert Schumann Society; Doctor Honoris Causa of University of Oxford; Commandatore da Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia; Knighthood from the Order of Malta; Beethoven Medal of New York; Philadelphia Bowl of Philadelphia * 1982: La Orden del √Åguila Azteca of Mexico * 1980: Hans von B√ºlow Medal of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra * 1970: Gro√ües Bundesverdienstkreuz of the Federal Republic of Germany * 1965: Chevalier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France; Presented with 'The Mask of Chopin' & Chopin's manuscripts * 1959: Santiago's Honorary Citizen; Concepci√≥n's Honorary Citizen and City Gold Medal; Hijo Benem√©rito de Chill√°n; Chill√°n's hitherto Lumaco Street was named after Claudio Arrau * 1958: The Medal of The Royal Philharmonic Society * 1949: Hijo Predilecto de M√©xico; Doctor Honoris Causa of University of Chile * 1941: Hijo Ilustre de Chill√°n * 1927: Winner of the Grand Prix of the Concours International des Pianistes Geneva.

The bands that followed relied more on metal than funk, though they retained the wild bass lines.\\"Funk Metal. Retrieved February 1, 2012. In spite of the genre's name, the website categorises it as a style of alternative rock rather than heavy metal music. In his book Know Your Enemey: The Story of Rage Against the Machine, Joel Mclver wrote that funk metal is \\"a slightly clumsy term applied in the late eighties to any rock band whose bass player used a slapping style.\\" He goes on to write \\"The best known funk- metallers were the Red Hot Chili Peppers (who later achieved global success with a more pop-oriented approach) and Living Colour (an impossibly talented group of players who were just too far ahead of their time to keep it together for long).

Entertainment Weekly noted in a May 1991 article that \\"Despite the rise of black rockers like Living Colour, the American funk-metal scene is predominantly white.\\" Many reviewers often cited Living Colour as having been a band that were directly inspired by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The vocalist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis, played down similarities between the two bands. He stated at the time, \\"Living Colour to me sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. But I have to deal with [this] on a daily basis: 'Wow, Living Colour's really biting your style. Y'ever see the guy on stage? He moves just like you.'\\" The funk metal sound was most prevalent in the West Coast of the United States, particularly in the state of California, although it managed to gain some international recognition through foreign acts such as British group Scat Opera and Super Junky Monkey, an all-female funk metal/avant-garde band from Japan. =Popularity and decline= The success of Faith No More's 1989 song \\"Epic\\" helped heighten interest in the genre. Anthony Kiedis later claimed Faith No More's singer, Mike Patton, had stolen the funk metal aesthetic he pioneered in the 1980s, specifically in \\"Epic\\" and its popular music video. He said \\"I watched [their] 'Epic' video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror.\\" Since the Red Hot Chili Peppers had not yet broken outside of America, he believed European audiences would view him as being an imitator of Patton. The LA Weekly state: \\"Faith No More, then led by vocalist Chuck Mosley, before Patton joined the band, used to open for the similarly progressive Peppers just as the funk-metal scene was gaining momentum. By 1989, as both bands were getting exceedingly popular, they both landed European tours, with Faith No More‚Äôs scheduled to begin a few months before RHCP's. This wasn‚Äôt an issue, until Kiedis saw the video for FNM‚Äôs 'Epic'\\". Faith No More's keyboardist Roddy Bottum responded to Kiedis' allegations by saying, \\"To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities [...] I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started.\\"Kerrang magazine (August 1990) The feud continued in the late 90s and early 2000s with Patton's other funk metal band, Mr. Bungle, who were heavily inspired by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in their early days. The genre had reached a commercial peak by late 1991, with funk metal albums such as Blood Sugar Sex Magik (by Red Hot Chili Peppers), Sailing the Seas of Cheese (by Primus) and Mr. Bungle's self-titled debut attaining critical acclaim from the mainstream music press. Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post claimed in a 1991 article that \\"much of it sounds like art rock\\". AllMusic described the genre as a \\"brief but extremely media-hyped stylistic fad\\". According to Steev Esquivel of the band Skinlab, the prevalance of funk metal around this time hurt the popularity of thrash metal music in the San Francisco Bay Area. He said Primus and Faith No More \\"came in and shut down the metal scene single handedly\\", and that bands such as these attracted a large female demographic that had previously followed thrash metal.Steev Esquivel, 2019 By the latter part of the 90s, funk metal was represented by a smaller group of bands, including Incubus, Sugar Ray, Jimmie's Chicken Shack and 311. Bands from other genres such as nu metal (Korn, Primer 55, Bloodhound Gang) and punk (Snot, Zebrahead) also incorporated elements of funk metal into their sound during the late 90s and early 2000s. Korn, who are often credited with popularizing the nu metal genre on their 1994 debut, have mentioned Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their two earliest influences. Mega!! Kung Fu Radio, the 1997 major label debut of Powerman 5000, showcased an aggressive form of funk metal, which the band themselves branded as \\"action-rock\\". All subsequent releases from Powerman 5000 moved towards an industrial metal/industrial rock sound. AllMusic suggests the genre was \\"played-out by the end of the decade\\". Influential 80s and early 90s acts such as Faith No More, Mr. Bungle and Red Hot Chili Peppers had largely abandoned the sound in favor of other styles by this point. Faith No More's bassist Billy Gould claimed he was \\"sick\\" of the genre as early as 1992,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdPYQgukr8 although the band's 1992 album Angel Dust has been described as having some funk metal characteristics. In 1995, he said: \\"we were perceived as a gimmick: a mixture of metal and funk and we had this pretty-boy singer. We found it really repulsive. We started getting tapes from bands who were heavy metal funk bands and they were saying we were their main influence, it was horrible. Angel Dust was a way for us to stretch our arms out and hold on to our identity, [Mike] Patton cut his hair and changed how he looked.\\" Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1995 album One Hot Minute was still considered to have elements of their original funk metal/punk-funk sound,http://archives.nd.edu/observer/v49/2015-11-18_v49_056.pdf however, beginning with 1999's Californication, they began heading towards a more mainstream funk-influenced pop direction. According to The Washington Post in 1999, acts such as Korn and Limp Bizkit built on the \\"funk/metal/rap hybrid\\" of Red Hot Chili Peppers during the four year interval between One Hot Minute and Californication. However, Anthony Kiedis has stated, \\"I don't think any of those conservative, ultra-aggro, rap metal bands had the funk influence or punk-rock energy that we had.\\" During 2001, Alien Ant Farm released a hugely successful funk metal cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal\\", an electro funk song. Bands from the 2000s and 2010s described as funk metal include Psychostick, Twelve Foot Ninja and Prophets of Rage (a supergroup featuring members of Cypress Hill, Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine). In 2016, Vice Magazine referred to funk metal as \\"a mostly-forgotten and occasionally- maligned genre\\". Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance mentioned his fondness for the genre in a 2007 interview. When asked if he thought it would make a comeback, he stated \\"Fuckin' revisionists probably won't think its cool enough... they'll go straight for the flannels and heroin.\\" Citations =Bibliography= * Heavy metal genres Alternative metal genres Funk genres Fusion music genres 20th-century music genres 1980s in music 1990s in music ","title":"Funk metal"},{"id":"171939","text":"Small Soldiers is a 1998 American science fiction film directed by Joe Dante from a screenplay by Ted Elliott. It stars Kirsten Dunst and Gregory Smith, along with the voices of Frank Langella and Tommy Lee Jones. The film depicts two conflicting factions of action figures who turn sentient after being programmed with a military microprocessor, putting lives in danger when one faction turns violent in their efforts to eliminate their enemy toys and anyone assisting them. Released on July 10, 1998, in the United States, the film received mixed reviews, but grossed $87.5 million on a $40 million budget. Small Soldiers marks the last on-screen film role of Phil Hartman, who died two months before the film's American premiere, and is dedicated in his memory. Additionally, it marked the final film appearance of Clint Walker before his retirement and later death in May 2018.  Plot  Top defense contractor GloboTech Industries acquires the Heartland Toy Company and as part of the move, Globotech CEO Gil Mars tells Heartland toy designers Larry Benson and Irwin Wayfair to develop actual live action toys capable of \\"playing back\\". Mars selects Larry's soldiers, the Commando Elite for the project and Irwin's creatures, the Gorgonites for their enemies, with the toy line expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Larry forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's X1000 microprocessor to activate the toys. Adolescent Alan Abernathy signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders, Archer and Chip Hazard. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple, buys Chip Hazard as a birthday present for her brother, Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite apparently attack the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the artificial intelligence circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with electromagnetic pulse shielding. The Commando Elite pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer in the kitchen. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro, whom he mortally wounds. His parents, Stuart and Irene, arrive at the kitchen, having been alerted by the sounds of the scuffle there. Alan attempts to explain what is going on, but with Archer not supporting his explanation, neither of his parents believe him. The next day, Alan and Archer find the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the store. At home, Alan learns the goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their home Gorgon, which they mistakenly believe to be in Yosemite National Park. Through tapping the Abernathys' phone line, the Commando Elite learn of Alan's interest in Christy, immobilize the Fimples' household and take Christy hostage to force Alan into surrendering the Gorgonites. Alan and Archer sneak into the Fimples' house to save Christy, but run into her Gwendy dolls, whom the Commando Elite engineered into auxiliary troops. The Gwendys quickly subdue Alan. Archer cuts Christy loose from her bonds, and together they save Alan and destroy the Gwendys before escaping. The Commando Elite pursue them in kit-bashed vehicles, but all except Chip Hazard are destroyed in a crash. The two adolescents and Archer return to Alan's house, only to find both their families waiting for them, believing that Alan kidnapped Christy and immobilized the Fimples. This time, Stuart and Irene believe Alan and Christy's account of the Gorgonites and the Commando Elite, but Phil and Marion, Christy's parents, remain skeptical. Irwin and Larry arrive and talk to Alan about his voicemail. At that moment, Chip Hazard attacks the house with a new force of Commando Elite from a hijacked recall shipment by Joe and with more improvised vehicles and weapons. The Commando Elite attack the Gorgonites and the humans, resulting in the house's electricity supply being cut off. Inspired by Irwin's advice to create an EMP blast, Alan heads out to force an overload of the power lines. Christy, Irwin, and Larry head to the Fimples' house to turn on all electronic items inside and wedge the circuit breakers open for a larger surge. The Gorgonites emerge and fight back against the Commando Elite. Chip Hazard flies to the top of the power line pole to stop Alan, where he battles and defeats Archer, but finds himself thrust by Alan into the power transformers, triggering the EMP blast, which destroys Chip Hazard along with the remaining Commando Elite. Mars arrives in his helicopter during the police and fire department cleanup the next day. He pays Joe, the Fimples, and the Abernathys for damages, as well as buying their silence from the media, and orders Larry and Irwin to repurpose the Commando Elite for military use. Among the craziness of the aftermath, Alan and Christy part on highly amicable terms, having agreed to start a relationship with each other. Alan later discovers the Gorgonites have screened themselves from the EMP blast by hiding underneath the Fimples' large satellite dish. The Abernathys bring the Gorgonites to Yosemite National Park, where Alan sends them out in a large toy boat from his father's store to find their home of Gorgon.

Cummings was uncredited for the role. * Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christina Ricci as the Gwendy dolls: dolls owned by Christy who are engineered to assist the Commando Elite Excluding Jones and Dern, the Commando Elite are voiced by cast members from the 1967 film The Dirty Dozen. Dern replaced The Dirty Dozen actor Richard Jaeckel, who died before shooting began.Joe Dante Excluding Langella and Cummings, the Gorgonites are voiced by cast members from the 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap. Miller and Balaski previously appeared in Joe Dante's films Piranha and The Howling, while the character of fellow The Howling cast member Picardo, Ralph Quist, shares a surname with Eddie Quist, his character in that film. Small Soldiers was Hartman's last on-screen role before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory.  Production  On making the film, director Joe Dante recalled, \\"Originally I was told to make an edgy picture for teenagers, but when the sponsor tie-ins came in the new mandate was to soften it up as a kiddie movie. Too late, as it turned out, and there are elements of both approaches in there. Just before release it was purged of a lot of action and explosions.\\" On the film's special effects, Dante stated, \\"We were planning to use a lot of Stan Winston's puppets‚Äîhe had made some very elaborate puppets that could do a lot of things. But in practice, we found it was much simpler and cheaper to let the CGI people do the work after we'd shot the scenes. So, I would say, it's one-third puppetry and the rest CGI in Small Soldiers, even though the original idea was to do mostly puppetry.\\"  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 48% of 44 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average score is of 6.2/10. The critical consensus states, \\"Small Soldiers has plenty of visual razzle-dazzle, but the rote story proves disappointingly deficient in director Joe Dante's trademark anarchic spirit.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B+ on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying: \\"The toys are presented as individuals who can think for themselves, and there are believable heroes and villains among them. For smaller children, this could be a terrifying experience.\\" Caroline Westbrook of Empire Magazine gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and said: \\"It's Gremlins with toy soldiers, except not quite as dark or funny.\\" The film grossed $55.2 million in the United States and Canada and $87.5 million worldwide.  In other media  A soundtrack containing classic rock blended with hip hop was released on July 7, 1998 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at 103 on the Billboard 200. The film score was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. In addition, a video game based on the film was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and released by Electronic Arts on September 30, 1998. Kenner Products (a subsidiary of Hasbro) produced a line of toys, which featured the Gorgonites and the Commando Elite. Burger King teamed up with the film to promote their new product, the Rodeo Burger. They created a line of kids' meal toys tied to the film. They were met with some controversy after the film received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Burger King executives claimed this caught the company by surprise and they were led to believe the film would receive no higher than a PG rating. While the pamphlet accompanying the toys included the disclaimer \\"While toys are suitable for children of all ages, the movie Small Soldiers may contain material that is inappropriate for younger children,\\" some restaurants accepted an exchange for Mr. Potato Head toys.https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/582385-small-soldiers-squad-commander  Cancelled remake  A remake of Small Soldiers was in development by 20th Century Fox called Toymageddon. The script was purchased in January 2014, and director Justin Lin was set to produce the film. The story was described to be set in a \\"toy factory that begins to run amok.\\" At that time it was not explicitly stated to be a remake of Small Soldiers. Due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney on March 20, 2019, Disney later in August cancelled the film along with over 200 other projects, which revealed the film was intended as a remake of Small Soldiers.

Early glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s, as visual elements taken from acts such as T. Rex, the New York Dolls, and David Bowie (and to a lesser extent, the punk and new wave movements taking place concurrently in New York City) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as Alice Cooper and Kiss. The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It achieved huge commercial success from approximately 1981 to 1991, bringing to prominence bands such as Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella and Warrant. From a strictly visual perspective, glam metal is defined by flashy and tight-fitting clothing, makeup, and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional \\"denim & leather\\" aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by spandex, lace, and heavy use of the color pink. Glam metal suffered a decline in popularity in the early-mid 1990s, as the grunge and alternative phenomena revolutionized hard rock, and fans' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a rejection of the glam metal visual style. During this period, many of the most successful acts of the genre's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction. Glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the late 1990s, with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, as well as the emergence of new, predominantly European bands, including the Darkness, Crazy Lixx, Santa Cruz, Reckless Love, The Struts, and American band Steel Panther. Characteristics, fashion, and terminology Musically, glam metal combines a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs.C. Smith, 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , pp. 160‚Äì2. Like other heavy metal songs of the 1980s (most notably thrash metal songs), they often feature shred guitar solos.D. Bukszpan, The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal (London: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2003), , p. 63. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale.G. T. Pillsbury, Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity (New York, NY: CRC Press, 2006), , p. 45. These were among the most commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience that would not have been attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman. Aesthetically glam metal draws heavily on the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s,P. Auslander, Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), , p. 232. often with very long backcombed hair, use of hair spray, use of make-up, gaudy clothing and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands).D. Bukszpan, The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal (London: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2003), , p. 60. The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided with the rise of the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in the tabloid press.R. Batchelor and S. Stoddart, The 1980s (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007), , p. 121. Sociologist Deena Weinstein points to the large number of terms used to describe more commercial forms of heavy metal, which she groups together as lite metal. These include, beside glam metal: melodic metal, false metal, poodle bands, nerf metal, pop metal or metal pop, the last of which was coined by critic Philip Bashe in 1983 to describe bands such as Van Halen and Def Leppard.D. Weinstein, Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2000), , pp. 45‚Äì47. AllMusic distinguishes pop metal, which refers to the whole pop-tinted hard rock and heavy metal scene of the 1980s (including Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Europe), from hair metal, the characteristics of which are flashy clothing and heavy makeup (as embodied by Poison, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe).\\"Hair metal\\", AllMusic. Retrieved November 2014. Use of the derogatory term hair metal started in the early 1990s, as grunge gained popularity at the expense of 1980s metal. In the \\"definitive metal family tree\\" of his documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, anthropologist Sam Dunn differentiates pop metal, which includes bands like Def Leppard, Europe, and Whitesnake, from glam metal bands that include M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Poison.Metal ‚Äì A Headbanger's Journey, DVD, ASIN B000FS9OZY (2005). History =Predecessors= The New York Dolls in 1973. Their visual style influenced the look of many 1980s-era glam metal groups. Music journalist Stephen Davis claims the influences of the style can be traced back to acts like Kiss, Boston, Cheap Trick, and the New York Dolls.S. Davis, Watch You Bleed: The Saga of Guns N' Roses (New York, NY: Gotham Books, 2008), , p. 30. Kiss and to a lesser extent Alice Cooper, were major influences on the genre.I. Ellis, Soft Skull Press, (Soft Skull Press, 2008), Finnish band Hanoi Rocks, heavily influenced themselves by the New York Dolls, have been credited with setting a blueprint for the look of hair metal.B. Macdonald, J. Harrington and R. Dimery, Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (London: Quintet, 2006), , p. 508. Van Halen has been seen as highly influential on the movement, emerging in 1978 from the Los Angeles music scene on Sunset Strip, with a sound based around the lead guitar skills of Eddie Van Halen. He popularized a playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song \\"Eruption\\" from the album Van Halen. This sound, and lead singer David Lee Roth's stage antics, would be highly influential on glam metal, although Van Halen would never fully adopt a glam aesthetic. Def Leppard, often categorized with the New Wave of British heavy metal, released their second album High 'n' Dry in 1981, mixing glam rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 293‚Äì94. =Mainstream success (1981‚Äì1991)= First wave (1981‚Äì1986) In the early 1980s, bands from across the United States began to move towards what would become the glam metal sound. In 1981, M√∂tley Cr√ºe (from Los Angeles) released their first album Too Fast for Love, Dokken (also from Los Angeles) released their first album, Breaking the Chains, and Kix (from western Maryland) released their first album, Kix. In 1982, Night Ranger (from San Francisco) released their initial album Dawn Patrol which reached the top 40 in the United States. Quiet Riot was one of the first glam metal bands to achieve mainstream success. 1983 was the breakout year for heavy metal: Quiet Riot's Metal Health was the first heavy metal album to reach number one in the Billboard charts. Quiet Riot success paved the way for many heavy metal acts, glam and otherwise, as the decade progressed.E. Rivadavia, [ \\"Quiet Riot\\"], AllMusic. Retrieved 7 July 2010. That same year saw a larger wave of heavy metal albums achieve previously unheard of commercial success, with M√∂tley Cr√ºe releasing its second album Shout at the Devil, Def Leppard releasing its third album Pyromania, and Kiss releasing Lick It Up. Though glam metal had not yet truly emerged as a commercially viable heavy metal subgenre, these bands opened the doors. Def Leppard's Pyromania, later certified 10x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), reached number two on the Billboard 200. The singles \\"Foolin'\\", \\"Photograph\\", and \\"Rock of Ages\\", helped by the emergence of MTV, reached the Top 40. \\"American album certifications ‚Äì Def Leppard ‚Äì Pyromania\\". RIAA.

We were in fuckin' Holland making Hysteria. While they were out banging chicks or whatever, we were looking at windmills and playing pool on a table without any pockets. We were as far away from LA as any band could be.\\" The most active glam metal scene was starting to appear in clubs on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, including The Trip, the Whisky a Go Go, and the Starwood. These clubs began to avoid booking punk rock bands because of fears of violence and began booking many area metal bands, usually on a \\"pay to play\\" basis, thus creating a vibrant scene for hard rock music.A. Chapman and L. Silber, Rock to Riches: Build Your Business the Rock & Roll Way (Capital Books, 2008), , p. 151. An increasing numbers of metal bands were able to produce debut albums in 1984, including Ratt (from Los Angeles) with its breakthrough album Out of the Cellar, Bon Jovi (from New Jersey) with its debut Bon Jovi, Great White with Great White, Black 'n Blue (from Portland, Oregon) with Black 'n Blue, Autograph with its first album Sign In Please, and W.A.S.P. with its self-titled debut album. Also in 1984, Lita Ford put out her second album called Dancin' on the Edge, Quiet Riot released its follow-up to Metal Health called Condition Critical, Dokken released its second album called Tooth and Nail, and Kiss released the glam-sounding Animalize. All these bands played a part in developing the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s.R. Moore, Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2009), , pp. 105‚Äì6. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear. M√∂tley Cr√ºe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800¬∞ Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their d√©but album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.D.

Second wave (1986‚Äì1991) By the mid-late 1980s, glam metal had begun to become a major mainstream success in America with many of these band's music videos appearing on heavy rotation on MTV often at the top of MTV's daily dial countdown, and some of the bands appeared on the channel's shows such as Headbanger's Ball, which became one of the most popular programs with over 1.3 million views a week.R.

Three other Bon Jovi songs also went to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the 1980s. 1986 was a significant year for glam metal music as one of the most commercially significant releases of the era was put out by Bon Jovi with Slippery When Wet which mixed hard rock with a pop sensibility, and spent a total of eight weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 12 million copies in the United States.

Four Def Leppard songs were on the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. Glam metal bands continued their run of commercial success in 1987 with M√∂tley Cr√ºe releasing Girls, Girls, Girls, White Lion releasing Pride, and Def Leppard releasing Hysteria producing a hard rock record of seven hit singles.

It also highlighted the excesses of glam metal, particularly the scene in which W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes was interviewed while drinking vodka on a floating chair in a swimming pool as his mother watched. As a result, it has been seen as helping to create a backlash against the genre.E. Danville and C. Mott, The Official Heavy Metal Book of Lists (Fayetteville, AR: University of Arkansas Press, 2009), , p. 16.M. G. Hurd, Women Directors and their Films (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007), , p. 79. In the early 1990s glam metal's popularity rapidly declined after nearly a decade of success. Successful bands lost members that were key to their songwriting and/or live performances, such as M√∂tley Crue's frontman Vince Neil, Poison guitarist C.C. DeVille, Def Leppard guitarist Steve Clark and Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Several music writers and musicians began to deride glam metal acts as \\"hair farmers,\\" hinting at the soon-to-be- popularized term \\"hair metal\\". Another reason for the decline in popularity of the style may have been the declining popularity of the power ballad. While its use, especially after a hard-rocking anthem, was initially a successful formula, in the early 1990s audiences lost interest in this approach.C. Aaron, \\"Don't fight the power\\", Spin, vol. 17, No. 11, Nov 2001, ISSN 0886-3032, p. 90. Nirvana performing at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards One significant factor in the decline was the rise of grunge music from Seattle, with bands including Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. This was particularly obvious after the success of Nirvana's Nevermind (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a dirty sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes, a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style and performance.[ \\"Grunge\\"], AllMusic. Retrieved 18 June 2010. Many major labels felt they had been caught off-guard by the surprise success of grunge and began turning over their personnel in favor of younger staffers more versed in the new scene. As MTV shifted its attention to the new style, glam metal bands found themselves relegated increasingly to late night airplay, and Headbanger's Ball was cancelled at the end of 1994, while KNAC went over to Spanish programming. Given glam metal's lack of a major format presence on radio, bands were left without a clear way to reach their audience. Other (earlier Hollywood) alternative rock bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction also helped supplant the popularity of the genre.R. Moore, Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2009), , p. 117. Some artists tried to alter their sound, while others struggled on with their original format. In 1995, Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller that would be the band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, left the band soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III. Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album with more of an alternative/grunge approach, which had little commercial success. Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers' 1992 debut album Generation Terrorists featured a glam metal sound. The album reached No. 1 in the UK Rock Chart, but failed to chart in the United States. Meanwhile, Guns N' Roses' classic-lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 punk rock covers album \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\". Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1998. Axl Rose, the only remaining member from the classic lineup at that point, worked with several lineups of the band to record Chinese Democracy ‚Äì an album that would take over ten years to complete and see the band incorporate electronic rock, industrial rock and nu metal styles. =Revivals and nostalgia festivals (1997‚Äìpresent)= The Darkness performing in Sydney, Australia in 2004 During the late 1990s and 2000s, glam metal began to have a revival. Some established acts who had managed to weather the storm enjoyed renewed popularity, others reformed and new bands emerged to emulate the glam metal style. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with \\"It's My Life\\" (2000). They branched into country music with a version of their 2005 song \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\", which reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006 and the rock/country album Lost Highway which reached No. 1 in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound and reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. M√∂tley Cr√ºe reunited with Vince Neil to record the 1997 album Generation Swine and Poison reunited with guitarist C.C. DeVille in 1999, producing the mostly live Power to the People (2000); both bands began to tour extensively.

In 1945 she became the first Latin American author to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature, \\"for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin American world\\". Some central themes in her poems are nature, betrayal, love, a mother's love, sorrow and recovery, travel, and Latin American identity as formed from a mixture of Native American and European influences. Her portrait also appears on the 5,000 Chilean peso bank note. Early life Mistral was born in Vicu√±a, Chile, but was raised in the small Andean village of Montegrande, where she attended a primary school taught by her older sister, Emelina Molina. She respected her sister greatly, despite the many financial problems that Emelina brought her in later years. Her father, Juan Ger√≥nimo Godoy Villanueva, was also a schoolteacher. He abandoned the family before she was three years old, and died, long since estranged from the family, in 1911. Throughout her early years she was never far from poverty. By age fifteen, she was supporting herself and her mother, Petronila Alcayaga, a seamstress, by working as a teacher's aide in the seaside town of Compa√±ia Baja, near La Serena, Chile. In 1904 Mistral published some early poems, such as Enso√±aciones (\\"Dreams\\"), Carta √çntima (\\"Intimate Letter\\") and Junto al Mar (\\"By the Sea\\"), in the local newspaper El Coquimbo: Diario Radical, and La Voz de Elqui using a range of pseudonyms and variations on her civil name. In 1906, Mistral met Romelio Ureta, her first love, who killed himself in 1909. Shortly after, her second love married someone else. This heartbreak was reflected in her early poetry and earned Mistral her first recognized literary work in 1914 with Sonnets on Death (Sonnets de la muerte). Mistral was awarded first prize in a national literary contest Juegos Florales in the Chilean capital, Santiago. Writing about his suicide led the poet to consider death and life more broadly than previous generations of Latin American poets. While Mistral had passionate friendships with various men and women, and these impacted her writings, she was secretive about her emotional life. She had been using the pen name Gabriela Mistral since June 1908 for much of her writing. After winning the Juegos Florales she infrequently used her given name of Lucila Godoy for her publications. She formed her pseudonym from the names of two of her favorite poets, Gabriele D'Annunzio and Fr√©d√©ric Mistral or, as another story has it, from a composite of the Archangel Gabriel and the mistral wind of Provence. In 1922, Mistral released her first book, Desolation (Desolacion), with the help of the Director of Hispanic Institute of New York, Federico de Onis. It was a collection of poems that encompassed motherhood, religion, nature, morality and love of children. Her personal sorrow was present in the poems and her International reputation was established. Her work was a turn from modernism in Latin America and was marked by critics as direct, yet simplistic. In 1924, she released her second book, Tenderness (Ternura). Career as an educator Gabriela Mistral during her youth Mistral's meteoric rise in Chile's national school system plays out against the complex politics of Chile in the first two decades of the 20th century. In her adolescence, the need for teachers was so great, and the number of trained teachers was so small, especially in the rural areas, that anyone who was willing could find work as a teacher. Access to good schools was difficult, however, and the young woman lacked the political and social connections necessary to attend the Normal School: She was turned down, without explanation, in 1907. She later identified the obstacle to her entry as the school's chaplain, Father Ignacio Munizaga, who was aware of her publications in the local newspapers, her advocacy of liberalizing education and giving greater access to the schools to all social classes. Although her formal education had ended by 1900, she was able to get work as a teacher thanks to her older sister, Emelina, who had likewise begun as a teacher's aide and was responsible for much of the poet's early education. The poet was able to rise from one post to another because of her publications in local and national newspapers and magazines. Her willingness to move was also a factor. Between the years 1906 and 1912 she had taught, successively, in three schools near La Serena, then in Barrancas, then Traigu√©n in 1910, and in Antofagasta in the desert north, in 1911. By 1912 she had moved to work in a liceo, or high school, in Los Andes, where she stayed for six years and often visited Santiago. In 1918 Pedro Aguirre Cerda, then Minister of Education and a future president of Chile, promoted her appointment to direct a liceo in Punta Arenas. She moved on to Temuco in 1920, then to Santiago, where in 1921, she defeated a candidate connected with the Radical Party, Josefina Dey del Castillo, to be named director of Santiago's Liceo #6, the country's newest and most prestigious girls' school. Controversies over the nomination of Gabriela Mistral to the highly coveted post in Santiago were among the factors that made her decide to accept an invitation to work in Mexico in 1922, with that country's Minister of Education, Jos√© Vasconcelos. He had her join in the nation's plan to reform libraries and schools, to start a national education system. That year she published Desolaci√≥n in New York, which further promoted the international acclaim she had already been receiving thanks to her journalism and public speaking. A year later she published Lecturas para Mujeres (Readings for Women), a text in prose and verse that celebrates Latin America from the broad, Americanist perspective developed in the wake of the Mexican Revolution. Following almost two years in Mexico she traveled from Laredo, Texas, to Washington D.C., where she addressed the Pan American Union, went on to New York, then toured Europe: In Madrid she published Ternura (Tenderness), a collection of lullabies and rondas written for an audience of children, parents, and other poets. In early 1925 she returned to Chile, where she formally retired from the nation's education system, and received a pension. It wasn't a moment too soon: The legislature had just agreed to the demands of the teachers union, headed by Mistral's lifelong rival, Amanda Labarca Hubertson, that only university-trained teachers should be given posts in the schools. The University of Chile had granted her the academic title of Spanish Professor in 1923, although her formal education ended before she was 12 years old. Her autodidacticism was remarkable, a testimony to the flourishing culture of newspapers, magazines, and books in provincial Chile, as well as to her personal determination and verbal genius. The poet Pablo Neruda, Chile's second Nobel Prize recipient, met Mistral when she moved to his hometown of Temuco. She read his poems and recommended reading for him. They became lifelong friends. International work and recognition Gabriela during the 1950s. Mistral's international stature made it highly unlikely that she would remain in Chile. In mid-1925 she was invited to represent Latin America in the newly formed Institute for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. With her relocation to France in early 1926 she was effectively an exile for the rest of her life. She made a living, at first, from journalism and then giving lectures in the United States and in Latin America, including Puerto Rico. She variously toured the Caribbean, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, among other places. Mistral lived primarily in France and Italy between 1926 and 1932. During these years she worked for the League for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, attending conferences of women and educators throughout Europe and occasionally in the Americas. She held a visiting professorship at Barnard College of Columbia University in 1930‚Äì1931, worked briefly at Middlebury College and Vassar College in 1931, and was warmly received at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, where she variously gave conferences or wrote, in 1931, 1932, and 1933. Like many Latin American artists and intellectuals, Mistral served as a consul from 1932 until her death, working in Naples, Madrid, Lisbon, Nice, Petr√≥polis, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Veracruz, Rapallo, and New York City. As consul in Madrid, she had occasional professional interactions with another Chilean consul and Nobel Prize recipient, Pablo Neruda, and she was among the earlier writers to recognize the importance and originality of his work, which she had known while he was a teenager and she was school director in his hometown of Temuco. She published hundreds of articles in magazines and newspapers throughout the Spanish-speaking world. Among her confidants were Eduardo Santos, President of Colombia, all of the elected Presidents of Chile from 1922 to her death in 1957, Eduardo Frei Montalva, who would be elected president in 1964, and Eleanor Roosevelt. The poet's second major volume of poetry, Tala, appeared in 1938, published in Buenos Aires with the help of longtime friend and correspondent Victoria Ocampo. The proceeds for the sale were devoted to children orphaned by the Spanish Civil War. This volume includes many poems celebrating the customs and folklore of Latin America as well as Mediterranean Europe. Mistral uniquely fuses these locales and concerns, a reflection of her identification as \\"una mestiza de vasco,\\" her European Basque-Indigenous Amerindian background. On 14 August 1943, Mistral's 17-year-old nephew, Juan Miguel Godoy, killed himself. Mistral considered Juan Miguel as a son and she called him Yin Yin. The grief of this death, as well as her responses to tensions of World War II and then the Cold War in Europe and the Americas, are all reflected in the last volume of poetry published in her lifetime, Lagar, which appeared in a truncated form in 1954. A final volume of poetry, Poema de Chile, was edited posthumously by her partner Doris Dana and published in 1967. Poema de Chile describes the poet's return to Chile after death, in the company of an Indian boy from the Atacama desert and an Andean deer, the huemul. This collection of poetry anticipates the interests in objective description and re-vision of the epic tradition just then becoming evident among poets of the Americas, all of whom Mistral read carefully. Gabriela Mistral Early Childhood Center in Houston\\"School Histories: the Stories Behind the Names .\\" Houston Independent School District. Retrieved on 24 September 2008. On 15 November 1945, Mistral became the first Latin American, and fifth woman, to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. She received the award in person from King Gustav of Sweden on 10 December 1945. In 1947 she received a doctor honoris causa from Mills College, Oakland, California. In 1951 she was awarded the National Literature Prize in Chile. Poor health somewhat slowed Mistral's traveling. During the last years of her life she made her home in the town of Roslyn, New York; in early January 1957 she transferred to Hempstead, New York, where she died from pancreatic cancer on 10 January 1957, aged 67. Her remains were returned to Chile nine days later. The Chilean government declared three days of national mourning, and hundreds of thousands of mourners came to pay her their respects. Some of Mistral's best known poems include Piececitos de Ni√±o, Balada, Todas √çbamos a ser Reinas, La Oraci√≥n de la Maestra, El √Ångel Guardi√°n, Dec√°logo del Artista and La Flor del Aire. She wrote and published some 800 essays in magazines and newspapers; she was also a well-known correspondent and highly regarded orator both in person and over the radio. Mistral may be most widely quoted in English for Su Nombre es Hoy (His Name is Today): :‚ÄúWe are guilty of many errors and many faults, but our worst crime is abandoning the children, neglecting the fountain of life. Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot. Right now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood is being made, and his senses are being developed. To him we cannot answer ‚ÄòTomorrow,‚Äô his name is today.‚Äù Characteristics of her work Mistral's work is characterized by including gray tones in her literature; sadness and bitterness are recurrent feelings on it. These are evoked in her writings as the reflection of a hard childhood, plagued by deprivation coupled with a lack of affection in her home. However, since her youth as a teacher in a rural school, Gabriela Mistral had a great affection for children that shows throughout her writing. Religion was also reflected in her literature as Catholicism had great influence in her life. Nevertheless, she always reflected a more neutral stance regarding the concept of religion. Thus we can find the religious combined with feelings of love and piety, making her into one of the worthiest representatives of Latin American literature of twentieth century.Dario, R., & Mistral, G.

Death, posthumous tributes and legacy  During the 1970s and 1980s, the image of Gabriela Mistral was appropriated by the military dictatorship of Pinochet presenting her as a symbol of \\"submission to the authority\\" and \\"social order\\". Views of her as a saint-like celibate and suffering heterosexual woman were first challenged by author Licia Fiol-Matta who contends that she was rather a lesbian. The suspects about her eventual lesbianism were reaffirmed with the discovery of her archive in 2007, after the death of her claimed last romantic partner, Doris Dana, in 2006. Dana had kept thousands of documents, including letters between Mistral and her various eventual female lovers. The publication of the letters she wrote to Dana herself in the volume Ni√±a errante (2007), edited by Pedro Pablo Zegers, reaffirmed the idea that the two had a long-lasting romantic relationship that supported Mistral in her latest years. The letters were translated to English by Velma Garc√≠a and published by University of New Mexico Press in 2018. Regardless of these hypothesis about the claimed romance between them, Doris Dana, who was 31 years younger than Mistral, denied explicitly in her last interview that her relationship with Mistral was romantic or erotic, and described it as the relationship between a stepmother and her stepdaughter. Dana refused being lesbian and in her opinion is unlikely that Gabriela Mistral was lesbian. Mistral had diabetes and heart problems. Eventually she died of pancreatic cancer in Hempstead Hospital in New York City on 10 January 1957, being 67 years of age, with Doris Dana by her side.  Themes  Gabriela Mistral has been an influential part for Latin American Poetry. A powerful speech given by a member of the Swedish Academy, a Swedish writer Hjalmar Gullberg set the stage to understand the perspective and the emotions of who is Gabriela Mistral. Discussing how the first foreign verses of French poet Fr√©d√©ric Mistral were not able to be understood by his own mother, Gulberg explained how the old language of troubadours became the language of poetry. Ten years later with the birth of Gabriela Mistral, the language of the poets will continue to thrive and be heard for many years to come. The voice emitted from the mouth of Gabriela Mistral was able to shake the world and create a dent to society that opened the eyes and cleared the ears of those who are willing to hear her voice. Gullberg states, ‚Äúshe lifted her cry to the Heaven[1]‚Ä¶‚Äù, after experiencing the loss of her first love through suicide the young poet became Gabriela Mistral and her poetic words would begin to spread over all South America and other parts of the world. Since very little is known of her first love, we do know that his betrayal helped to create Mistral's poems filled with themes of death and despair, perhaps hatred toward God. In memory of her first love and later after the loss of a nephew who she loved like a son her collection of poems titled Desolaci√≥n, would begin to impact many others. The fifteenth poem found in Desolaci√≥n, shed tears for the loss of a child that will never be born to that of a dead man. These tears are commonly shed from the eyes of parents who love their children but suffer having them be taken away so soon, theme of loss for those who are loved. Themes of death, desolation and loss do not entirely fill the pages of Gabriela Mistral's books. Other themes such as love and motherhood, not just the love for her beloved railroad employee and nephew (son), were transferred to the very children she taught. It comes to no surprise that the name of her collection of songs and rounds is titled Ternura, to express her feelings of love she has for the children of her school. Printed in Madrid in 1924, her next collection of love filled words was felt and well received by four thousand Mexican children who would honor her by singing her very own collection of heart-felt words. Thanks to the hard work and profound dedication to her children she became known as the poet of motherhood. Having lived through two world wars and many other violent wars, paved the path for a third large collection, Tala (a title that was said to mean ‚Äúravage‚Äù by Gullberg). The poems in Tala contains a mixture of sacred hymn na√Øve song for children, poems that talk about water, corn, salt and wine. Gullberg continues to pay homage to Gabriela Mistral, who he says has become the great singer of sorrow and motherhood for Latin America. Gabriela Mistral's wonderful collections of poems and songs have created an atmosphere that expresses her care for children and all her sorrows that she has had to endure throughout her years as a teacher and a poet for Latin America. Themes of sorrow and motherhood that can be felt with every word that is expressed in her work.

In: Kirchhoff, Thomas (ed.): Online Encyclopedia Philosophy of Nature / Online Lexikon Naturphilosophie, doi: https://doi.org/10.11588/oepn.2020.0.71420; https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/oepn/article/view/71420. The main competing paradigms are anthropocentrism, physiocentrism (called ecocentrism as well), and theocentrism. Environmmental ethics exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheology, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography. There are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. For example: *Should humans continue to clear cut forests for the sake of human consumption? *Why should humans continue to propagate its species, and life itself? *Should humans continue to make gasoline-powered vehicles? *What environmental obligations do humans need to keep for future generations? *Is it right for humans to knowingly cause the extinction of a species for the convenience of humanity? *How should humans best use and conserve the space environment to secure and expand life? *What role can Planetary Boundaries play in reshaping the human-earth relationship? The academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the works of Rachel Carson and Murray Bookchin and events such as the first Earth Day in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in Science had a crucial impact: Lynn White's \\"The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis\\" (March 1967) and Garrett Hardin's \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\" (December 1968). Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called \\"Exploring New Ethics for Survival\\", as well as an essay by Aldo Leopold in his A Sand County Almanac, called \\"The Land Ethic,\\" in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949). The first international academic journals in this field emerged from North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s ‚Äì the US-based journal Environmental Ethics in 1979 and the Canadian-based journal The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy in 1983. The first British based journal of this kind, Environmental Values, was launched in 1992.  Marshall's categories  Some scholars have tried to categorise the various ways the natural environment is valued. Alan Marshall and Michael Smith are two examples of this, as cited by Peter Vardy in \\"The Puzzle of Ethics.\\"Peter Vardy, Paul Grosch: The Puzzle of Ethics. New York: Harper Collins 1999. According to Marshall, three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years: Libertarian Extension, the Ecologic Extension and Conservation Ethics. = Libertarian extension = Marshall‚Äôs libertarian extension echoes a civil liberty approach (i.e. a commitment to extend equal rights to all members of a community). In environmentalism, the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans. Andrew Brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism (eco-humanism), the argument that all ontological entities, animate and in-animate, can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist. The work of Arne N√¶ss and his collaborator Sessions also falls under the libertarian extension, although they preferred the term \\"deep ecology\\". Deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment ‚Äì the view that it is valuable in itself. Their argument falls under both the libertarian extension and the ecologic extension. Peter Singer's work can be categorized under Marshall's 'libertarian extension'. He reasoned that the \\"expanding circle of moral worth\\" should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals, and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism. Singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or \\"non-sentient\\" (non- conscious) entities, and concluded in his first edition of \\"Practical Ethics\\" that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth.Peter Singer: Practical Ethics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2011. This approach is essentially then, bio-centric. However, in a later edition of \\"Practical Ethics\\" after the work of N√¶ss and Sessions, Singer admits that, although unconvinced by deep ecology, the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible, but at best problematic. Singer advocated a humanist ethics. = Ecologic extension = Alan Marshall's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of all biological (and some abiological) entities and their essential diversity. Whereas Libertarian Extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world, ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world. Ecological Extension is roughly the same classification of Smith's eco-holism, and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity. Holmes Rolston, among others, has taken this approach. This category might include James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis; the theory that the planet earth alters its geo-physiological structure over time in order to ensure the continuation of an equilibrium of evolving organic and inorganic matter. The planet is characterized as a unified, holistic entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run. = Conservation ethics = Marshall's category of 'conservation ethics' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world. It focuses only on the worth of the environment in terms of its utility or usefulness to humans. It contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology,' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology,' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value ‚Äì instrumental to the welfare of human beings. Conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations. It could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by Governments at the Kyoto summit in 1997 and three agreements reached in the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.  Humanist theories  Peter Singer advocated the preservation of \\"world heritage sites,\\" unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a \\"scarcity value\\" as they diminish over time. Their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape. A good example of a world heritage site would be the tropical rainforest, a very specialist ecosystem that has taken centuries to evolve. Clearing the rainforest for farmland often fails due to soil conditions, and once disturbed, can take thousands of years to regenerate.  Applied theology  Laudato si' has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action The Christian world view sees the universe as created by God, and humankind accountable to God for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind. Ultimate values are seen in the light of being valuable to God. This applies both in breadth of scope - caring for people (Matthew 25) and environmental issues, e.g. environmental health (Deuteronomy 22.8; 23.12-14) - and dynamic motivation, the love of Christ controlling (2 Corinthians 5.14f) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin, which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness. In many countries this relationship of accountability is symbolised at harvest thanksgiving. (B.T. Adeney : Global Ethics in New Dictionary of Christian Ethics and Pastoral Theology 1995 Leicester) Abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public. John L. O'Sullivan, who coined the term Manifest destiny, and other influential people like him used Abrahamic ideologies to encourage action. These religious scholars, columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young America around the time of the Industrial Revolution. In order to solidify the understanding that God had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources, environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature, on a higher order.Scott, Peter. Ecology: Religious or Secular? Heythrop Journal. Jan 1997, Vol. 38 Issue 1. Those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that John Muir asks ironically in a section of his novel A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf, why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants, animals and natural disasters, The answer is that those creatures are a result of Adam and Eve's sins in the garden of Eden.Muir, John. From A Thousand-mile Walk to the Gulf. American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau. Ed. Bill McKibben. N.p.: The Library of America, 2008. 85-89. Since the turn of the 20th century, the application of theology in environmentalism diverged into two schools of thought. The first system of understanding holds religion as the basis of environmental stewardship. The second sees the use of theology as a means to rationalize the unmanaged consumptions of natural resources. Lynn White and Calvin DeWitt represent each side of this dichotomy. John Muir personified nature as an inviting place away from the loudness of urban centers. \\"For Muir and the growing number of Americans who shared his views, Satan's home had become God's Own Temple.\\"William Cronon, ed., Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature, New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1995, 69-90; The use of Abrahamic religious allusions assisted Muir and the Sierra Club to create support for some of the first public nature preserves. Authors like Terry Tempest Williams as well as John Muir build on the idea that \\"...God can be found wherever you are, especially outside. Family worship was not just relegated to Sunday in a chapel.\\"Williams, Terry T. Refuge : an unnatural history of family and place. New York: Vintage Books, 1992. Print. References like these assist the general public to make a connection between paintings done at the Hudson River School, Ansel Adams' photographs, along with other types of media, and their religion or spirituality. Placing intrinsic value upon nature through theology is a fundamental idea of Deep ecology.  Anthropocentrism  Anthropocentrism is the position that humans are the most important or critical element in any given situation; that the human race must always be its own primary concern. Detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the Western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them (see speciesism). Many argue that all environmental studies should include an assessment of the intrinsic value of non-human beings.Singer, Peter. \\"Environmental Values. The Oxford Book of Travel Stories. Ed. Ian Marsh. Melbourne, Australia: Longman Cheshire, 1991. 12-16. In fact, based on this very assumption, a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings.Tarik Kochi & Noam Ordan, \\"An Argument for the Global Suicide of Humanity\\". Borderlands, 2008, Vol. 3, 1-21. The authors refer to the idea as a thought experiment that should not be understood as a call for action. Baruch Spinoza reasoned that if humans were to look at things objectively, they would discover that everything in the universe has a unique value. Likewise, it is possible that a human-centred or anthropocentric/androcentric ethic is not an accurate depiction of reality, and there is a bigger picture that humans may or may not be able to understand from a human perspective. Peter Vardy distinguished between two types of anthropocentrism.Peter Vardy and Paul Grosch (1999), ..The Puzzle of Ethics.., p. 231. A strong anthropocentric ethic argues that humans are at the center of reality and it is right for them to be so. Weak anthropocentrism, however, argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view, thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it. Another point of view has been developed by Bryan Norton, who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism, now one of its leading trends. Environmental pragmatism refuses to take a stance in disputes between defenders of anthropocentrist and non-anthropocentrist ethics. Instead, Norton distinguishes between strong anthropocentrism and weak-or-extended- anthropocentrism and argues that the former must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world.Afeissa, H. S. (2008). \\"The Transformative value of Ecological Pragmatism. An Introduction to the Work of Bryan G. Norton\\". S.A.P.I.EN.S. 1 (1). A recent view relates anthropocentrism to the future of life. Biotic ethics are based on the human identity as part of gene/protein organic life whose effective purpose is self- propagation. This implies a human purpose to secure and propagate life. Humans are central because only they can secure life beyond the duration of the Sun, possibly for trillions of eons. Biotic ethics values life itself, as embodied in biological structures and processes. Humans are special because they can secure the future of life on cosmological scales. In particular, humans can continue sentient life that enjoys its existence, adding further motivation to propagate life. Humans can secure the future of life, and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose.  Status of the field  Only after 1990 did the field gain institutional recognition at programs such as Colorado State University, the University of Montana, Bowling Green State University, and the University of North Texas. In 1991, Schumacher College of Dartington, England, was founded and now provides an MSc in Holistic Science. These programs began to offer a master's degree with a specialty in environmental ethics/philosophy. Beginning in 2005 the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the University of North Texas offered a PhD program with a concentration in environmental ethics/philosophy. In Germany, the University of Greifswald has recently established an international program in Landscape Ecology & Nature Conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics. In 2009, the University of Munich and Deutsches Museum founded the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities.  Relationship with animal ethics  Differing conceptions of the treatment of and obligations towards animals, particularly those living in the wild, within animal ethics and environmental ethics has been a source of controversy between the two ethical positions; some ethicists have asserted that the two positions are incompatible, while others have argued that these disagreements can be overcome.

The population of Napier is about About south of Napier is the inland city of Hastings. These two neighbouring cities are often called \\"The Bay Cities\\" or \\"The Twin Cities\\" of New Zealand. The total population of the Napier-Hastings Urban Area is people, which makes it the sixth-largest urban area in New Zealand, closely followed by Dunedin (), and trailing Tauranga (). Napier is about northeast of the capital city of Wellington. Napier () has a slightly larger population than its neighbouring city of Hastings () and is seen as the main centre due to it being closer in distance to both the seaport and the main airport that service Hawke's Bay, and Hastings' population figure includes people living in Havelock North, which is often considered a town in its own right. The City of Napier has a land area of and a population density of 540.0 per square kilometre. Napier is the nexus of the largest wool centre in the Southern Hemisphere, and it has the primary export seaport for northeastern New Zealand ‚Äì which is the largest producer of apples, pears, and stone fruit in New Zealand. The Hawke's Bay wine region is now the second largest in New Zealand after Marlborough, and grapes grown around Hastings and Napier are sent through the Port of Napier for export. Large amounts of sheep's wool, frozen meat, wood pulp, and timber also pass through Napier annually for export. Smaller amounts of these materials are shipped via road and railway to the large metropolitan areas of New Zealand itself, such as Auckland, Wellington and Hamilton. Napier is a popular tourist city, with a unique concentration of 1930s Art Deco architecture, built after much of the city was razed in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. It also has one of the most photographed tourist attractions in the country, a statue on Marine Parade called Pania of the Reef. Thousands of people flock to Napier every February for the Tremains Art Deco Weekend event, a celebration of its Art Deco heritage and history. Other notable tourist events attracting many outsiders to the region annually include F.A.W.C! Food and Wine Classic events, and the Mission Estate Concert at Mission Estate Winery in the suburb of Taradale. History =MƒÅori history= Napier has well-documented MƒÅori history. When the NgƒÅti Kahungunu party of Taraia reached the district many centuries ago, the Whatumamoa, Rangitane and the NgƒÅti Awa and elements of the NgƒÅti Tara iwi existed in the nearby areas of Petane, Te Whanganui-a-Orotu and Waiohiki. Later, the NgƒÅti Kahungunu became the dominant force from Poverty Bay to Wellington. They were one of the first MƒÅori tribes to come in contact with European settlers. Napier's Tom Parker Fountain at dusk Chief Te Ahuriri cut a channel into the lagoon space at Ahuriri because the Westshore entrance had become blocked, threatening cultivations surrounding the lagoon and the fishing villages on the islands in the lagoon. The rivers were continually feeding freshwater into the area. Hastings Street, Napier, 1862 =European settlers' history= Napier Barracks c1864 Captain James Cook was one of the first Europeans to see the future site of Napier when he sailed down the east coast in October 1769. He commented: \\"On each side of this bluff head is a low, narrow sand or stone beach, between these beaches and the mainland is a pretty large lake of salt water I suppose.\\" He said the harbour entrance was at the Westshore end of the shingle beach. The site was subsequently visited and later settled by European traders, whalers and missionaries. By the 1850s, farmers and hotel-keepers arrived. Sound Shell (1931) in Napier at night. The Crown purchased the Ahuriri block (including the site of Napier) in 1851. In 1854 Alfred Domett, a future Prime Minister of New Zealand, was appointed as the Commissioner of Crown Lands and the resident magistrate at the village of Ahuriri. It was decided to place a planned town here, its streets and avenues were laid out, and the new town named for Sir Charles Napier, a military leader during the \\"Battle of Meeanee\\" fought in the province of Sindh, India. Domett named many streets in Napier to commemorate the colonial era of the British Indian Empire. Napier was designated as a borough in 1874, but the development of the surrounding marshlands and reclamation proceeded slowly. Between 1858 and 1876 Napier was the administrative centre for the Hawke's Bay Province, but in 1876 the \\"Abolition of Provinces Act\\", an act of the New Zealand Parliament, dissolved all provincial governments in New Zealand. T & G Dome at dusk Halsbury Chambers (architect Louis Hay, 1932), Napier Development was generally confined to the hill and to the port area of Ahuriri. In the early years, Napier covered almost exclusively an oblong group of hills (the Scinde Island) which was nearly entirely surrounded by the ocean, but from which ran out two single spits, one to the north and one to the south. There was a swamp between the now Hastings Street and Wellesley Road and the sea extended to \\"Clive Square\\". =1931 earthquake= On 3 February 1931, most of Napier and nearby Hastings was levelled by an earthquake. The collapses of buildings and the ensuing fires killed 256 people. The centre of the town was destroyed by the earthquake, and later rebuilt in the Art Deco style popular at that time. Some 4000 hectares of today's Napier were undersea before the earthquake raised it above sea level. The earthquake uplifted an area of 1500 km2 with a maximum of 2.7 m of uplift. In Hastings about 1 m of ground subsidence occurred. Although a few Art Deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact for long enough to become recognised as architecturally important, and beginning in the 1990s it had been protected and restored. Napier and the area of South Beach, Miami, Florida, are considered to be the two best-preserved Art Deco towns (with the town of Miami Beach, Florida, being mostly decorated in the somewhat later Streamline Moderne style of Art Deco). Beginning in 2007, Napier was nominated as a World Heritage Site with UNESCO. This is the first cultural site in New Zealand to be so nominated.Napier Art Deco historic precinct. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved on 7 May 2012. It was denied World Heritage status in 2011 as it did not meet the appropriate criteria. Still, the report of the application acknowledged the Art Deco heritage as \\"first and foremost of outstanding value to all New Zealanders\\". =Modern history= In January 1945, the entered and departed from the port of Napier undetected. This event became the basis of a widely circulated postwar tall tale that the captain of this U-boat, Heinrich Timm, had led crewmen ashore near Napier to milk cows to supplement their meagre rations. Napier was the scene of an armed attack by cannabis dealer Jan Molenaar on three police officers searching his home in May 2009. He killed one officer, and wounded two others and a civilian. He continued to fire shots from his house, which police besieged until he committed suicide 40 hours later. Geography and climate NASA satellite photo of Napier and southern Hawke Bay The city is on Napier Hill and the surrounding Heretaunga Plains at the southeastern edge of Hawke Bay, a large semi-circular bay that dominates the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. The coastline of the city was substantially altered by a large earthquake in 1931. The topography puts Napier in danger from a tsunami, as the centre of the commercial city is near sea level ‚Äì should the sea ever crest Marine Parade the sea would run through to Ahuriri. Furthermore, by virtue of its pre 1931 existence, the bulk of Napier is susceptible to soil liquefaction, the risk classed as Very High for the main urban area excluding the hill. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Napier has an oceanic climate (Cfb). The climate is warm and relatively dry resulting from its location on the east coast of the North Island. Most of New Zealand's weather patterns cross the country from the west, and the city lies in the rain shadow of the North Island Volcanic Plateau and surrounding ranges such as the Kaweka Range. =Suburbs= Labelled map of the 19 Suburbs that make up Napier City, New Zealand. Suburbs of Napier include: * Ahuriri Ward: ** Ahuriri ** Bay View ** Napier Port ** Bluff Hill ** Hospital Hill ** Onekawa (north part) ** Pandora ** Westshore * Nelson Park Ward: ** Awatoto (north part) ** Maraenui ** Marewa (south part) ** Napier CBD ** Napier South ** Onekawa (south part) ** Pirimai (south part) * Onekawa-Tamatea Ward: ** Marewa (north part) ** Onekawa (rest) *** Onekawa Central *** Onekawa West ** Pirimai (north part) ** Tamatea *** Tamatea North *** Tamatea South * Taradale Ward: ** Awatoto (south part) ** Greenmeadows ** Jervoistown ** Lagoon Farm ** Meeanee ** Orutu Park ** Poraiti ** Taradale *** Taradale North *** Taradale South ** Te Awa Demographics Napier City had a population of 62,241 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 5,001 people (8.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 6,882 people (12.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 23,670 households. There were 29,766 males and 32,478 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female. Of the total population, 12,321 people (19.8%) were aged up to 15 years, 10,740 (17.3%) were 15 to 29, 26,712 (42.9%) were 30 to 64, and 12,465 (20.0%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 81.2% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 22.2% MƒÅori, 3.4% Pacific peoples, 5.0% Asian, and 1.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 16.3, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 52.3% had no religion, 34.3% were Christian, and 6.3% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 8,622 (17.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 10,116 (20.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $28,900. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 23,535 (47.1%) people were employed full-time, 7,422 (14.9%) were part-time, and 1,755 (3.5%) were unemployed. Tourism and architecture National Tobacco Company building (1933) Napier's major tourist attraction is its architecture, which draws Art Deco and architecture enthusiasts from around the world. The rebuilding period after the 1931 earthquake coincided with the short-lived and rapidly changing Art Deco era and the Great Depression, when little \\"mainstreet\\" development was being undertaken elsewhere. As a result, Napier's architecture is strikingly different from any other city; the other notable Art Deco city, Miami Beach, has Streamline Moderne Art Deco. The whole centre of Napier was rebuilt simultaneously. The T & G Building (Atkin & Mitchell, Wellington, 1936) Pania of the Reef Other tourist attractions in Napier include MTG Hawke's Bay (the museum, art gallery and theatre) which features information on both the 1931 earthquake and Napier's redesign as an Art Deco city, the National Aquarium, the Napier Prison, the Soundshell and the Pania of the Reef statue. The Pania statue on Marine Parade is regarded in Napier in much the same way that the Little Mermaid statue is regarded in Copenhagen. In October 2005 the statue was stolen, but it was recovered a week later, largely unharmed. Marineland was a tourist attraction from 1965 until it closed in 2009. The National Aquarium is one of the foremost aquariums in New Zealand. The historic Napier Prison is the oldest prison in New Zealand and visitors can learn about the history of prisons as well as witness the path of the 1931 earthquake. It is the only place in Napier where some of the earthquake damage has been left in place. Tourists flock to Napier in February for Art Deco weekend. In 2018, the festival celebrated its 30th year, attracting an estimated 45,000 people. The Mission Estate Winery Concert in the Napier suburb of Greenmeadows which has featured Chris De Burgh, Olivia Newton-John, Eric Clapton, Kenny Rogers, Ray Charles, Rod Stewart, Sting performing with the NZ Symphony Orchestra, Shirley Bassey, Beach Boys, Doobie Brothers, Tom Jones, and in 2013 Barry Gibb with Carol King. Attractions nearby include the Cape Kidnappers Gannet Colony and many vineyards bordering Taradale, Hastings City, and north of Napier around Bay View and the Esk Valley. Many people use Napier as a gateway to Hawke's Bay, flying in to Hawke's Bay Airport at Westshore from Wellington City, Auckland and Christchurch. Tourists also enter Napier by State Highway 2 along the coast and State Highway 5 from Taupo. The rail line in and out of Hawke's Bay has not had a passenger service since 2001. Culture and entertainment Veronica Sunbay overlooking the sea on Marine Parade Port of Napier at night Spirit of Napier, or Gilray Fountain, along Marine Parade Cargo ship at the port of Napier, 1973 Entrance to the Napier prison Napier markets itself as the Art Deco Capital. The Hawke's Bay wine region is important to Napier's economy, with over 70 wineries located in the area. The region featured in Wine Enthusiast Magazine as one of the 10 Best Wine Travel Destinations in 2015. The region is New Zealand's largest apple, pear and stone fruit producer. The Port of Napier and rail network provides quick export of these goods. A large attraction is the Art Deco building designs. Marine Parade is one of Napier's most famous highlights ‚Äì a tree-lined ocean boulevard with fountains, gardens, mini golf, statues and spas. The National Aquarium of New Zealand is located on the south end of Marine Parade. The historic Napier Prison is located off the northern end of Marine Parade. Recent redevelopments of Marine Parade have seen the addition of shaded picnic areas and playgrounds. Napier's theatre scene includes productions put on by the Napier Operatic Society, based at the Tabard Theatre and putting on musicals at the Napier Municipal Theatre, another notable example of Art Deco architecture. There are high street and boutique stores as well as antique shops, art galleries, and studios of potters, wood turners and craftsman. The marina and waterfront in Ahuriri, Napier, is a sea-tourism attraction. Swimming and family activities are popular in Pandora Pond ‚Äì a salt water inlet by the inner harbour in Ahuriri ‚Äì or on the beaches and playgrounds of Marine Parade, Westshore and Ahuriri. The many rivers that flow through the region are used for water activities, such as jet boating, jet skiing, rowing, kayaking, fishing, whitebaiting and swimming. Development of the region's cycleways and walkways have included dedicated cycle lanes being established on urban streets in the Napier-Hastings urban areas, as well as a large variety of off- road pathways, which are often used as mixed use pathways for cyclists and pedestrians, such as the paths that stretch from Bay View to Clifton. The Hawke's Bay Trails contain nearly 200 km of cycleways that meander through and around the cities, and link the Napier-Hastings urban areas with surrounding suburbs and the local district. McLean Park is the main sporting venue in Hawke's Bay. The main sports played at the venue are cricket and rugby union. It was used to host matches during the 1987 Rugby World Cup, the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The annual model aircraft show 'Warbirds over Awatoto' takes place on the outskirts of Napier. The 2013 gathering attracted 48 pilots and 120 planes.

Napier suffered a double blow from service amalgamation towards the end of the century. The local newspaper, the (Napier) Daily Telegraph, was combined with the (Hastings) Herald-Tribune to form a new regional newspaper Hawke's Bay Today. The Napier offices were closed down in favour of locating the offices in Hastings. The next rationalisation saw the closure of Napier Hospital, with services being amalgamated with Hastings Hospital, creating Hawke's Bay Hospital at the Hastings site. Napier was selected as the site for the Hawkes Bay regional Council ahead of Hastings. View of Napier and Taradale from Sugar Loaf (behind Mission Winery) Government =Local= Napier has been governed by Napier City Council since 1950. Local government reform was mooted in the late 1990s and a referendum was held in 1999 proposing an amalgamation of the Hastings District Council with the Napier City Council. Although supported by approximately two-thirds of Hastings voters, Napier voters rejected the proposal by a similar number and the proposal was defeated. The National Government amended the Local Government Act in 2012 to determine a reorganisation proposal by a majority vote over the entire proposed area, rather than a majority over each existing area as was previously the case. Yet another change was to allow private submissions to the commission to trigger the process, whereas previously only local councils themselves could request a change in structure or boundary. The legislative restrictions on councils using public funds to support or challenge a final proposal did not apply to private lobby groups or individuals however. After a lengthy and divisive regional campaign to restructure local government in Hawke's Bay, in 2015 the Local Government Commission put forward a final reorganisation proposal to amalgamate Napier City Council with Wairoa District Council, Hastings District Council and Central Hawke's Bay District Council to form a proposed 'Hawke's Bay Council'. A postal ballot was established to maximise voter returns, and the vote closed on 15 September 2015. An interim count was available later that day, that saw the proposal defeated across the region by about 66%. In Napier the proposal was rejected by 84% of voters. =National= The city is covered by the general electorate and the MƒÅori electorate. After the 2017 general election, Napier is held by Stuart Nash while Ikaroa-RƒÅwhiti is held by Meka Whaitiri, both of the governing Labour Party. Sport McLean Park The city is home to the professional basketball team Hawke's Bay Hawks, which plays in the National Basketball League. It plays its home games in the Pettigrew Green Arena. Transportation =Air= Hawke's Bay Airport is the main airport in the Hawke's Bay region and has domestic flight services. It is jointly owned by the government, Napier City Council, and Hastings District Council, and is operated by Hawke's Bay Airport Ltd. The airport is located in the Napier suburb of Westshore. Air New Zealand provides frequent direct flights to and from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Jetstar, a Qantas subsidiary, used to serve Auckland, from 2015 to 2019. Sounds Air operates direct flights to Blenheim up to daily and smaller charter companies also operate including Air Napier. The airport was historically referred to as Napier Airport and its IATA code reflects that: NPE. It is situated on land that was formerly the Ahuriri Lagoon, an area that was raised above sea level by the massive 1931 Napier earthquake. The airport is located approximately 22 km north of Hastings Aerodrome, a smaller airport located close to Hastings that caters mainly for flight training and general aviation. =Pathways= The Hawke's Bay region has extensive cycleways and footpaths that originally began as the 'Rotary Pathways' between Napier and Hastings, and is now known as the 'Hawke's Bay Trails'. The network of pathways link the urban areas of Napier and Hastings, as well as many of the other outlying suburbs of the two cities. Some of the cycleways include dedicated cycling lanes on roads within the city, as well as separate dedicated pathways on roadsides and through parks and other areas, many of which are mixed use pathways for cyclists and pedestrians, such as the paths that stretch from Bay View to Clifton. The Hawke's Bay Trails contain over 200 km of cycleways that meander through and around the Napier-Hastings twin cities. The Napier Rotary Pathway creates a loop that encompasses the city from Esk River, to Westshore, Napier Central, Awatoto, Taradale, Poraiti, and looping back to the Esk Valley. This rotary also has several links to the Hastings Rotary Pathway. =Roads= State Highway 2 is the principal state highway serving Napier, connecting it to Wairoa and Gisborne to the north, and, via Dannevirke, to Wellington, Masterton and Palmerston North to the south. Between Napier and Hastings, SH 2 follows the Hawke's Bay Expressway, also known as the Napier-Hastings Expressway, which provides a direct and efficient link between the two cities. Although the Hawke's Bay Expressway bypasses Napier itself, it has connections to many of Napier's arterial roads that lead to the city centre and the Port (such as the junctions at Kennedy Road, Taradale Road, Prebensen Drive and Meeanee Quay) and also intersects with the access road to Hawke's Bay Airport. State Highway 5, known as the Napier-Taupo Road, begins at a junction on SH 2 just north of the Napier suburb of Bay View, and connects Napier and the Hawke's Bay region to Taupo and the central North Island. It is also the main route used for traffic travelling from Napier-Hastings to Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua and Tauranga, as it is quicker than the route through Gisborne taken by SH 2. State Highway 50 connects Napier to the southwestern Hawke's Bay, going through many small settlements. It also connects Napier to many of Hawke's Bay's wineries, of which the region is well known for. It makes up part of the Hawke's Bay Wine Trail. State Highway 51 is an alternative connection between Napier and Hastings, and largely follows the original route of SH 2 between the two cities prior to the completion of the Hawke's Bay Expressway, and SH 2 being shifted to run along it. While the original route followed Meeanee Quay through the suburbs of Westshore and Ahuriri before bridging across the Pandora Pond area of the Napier Inner Harbour marina, the SH 51 route follows Taradale Road instead, meeting up with the original SH 2 route at the southern base of Napier Hill at Hyderabad Road. The route then moves onto Georges Drive, where it borders the southern and western edges of the Napier city centre. It meets up with Marine Parade south of the CBD, and then follows the coast south from Napier through Clive to Hastings. Buses Go Bus operates 9 Go Bay routes in Napier, with funding from Regional Council. Bee Cards are to replace goBay cards on 24 August 2020. =Rail= The Palmerston North‚ÄìGisborne Line runs through Napier. The southern portion of the line between Napier and Palmerston North was built between 1872 and 1891, and the northern portion between Napier and Gisborne from 1912 to 1942. The line from Gisborne enters Napier via the coast, making its way through the city, before eventually turning inland towards Hastings, and onwards to Woodville (where the Wairarapa Line branches off) and Palmerston North. The Napier Port Branch, formerly known as the Ahuriri Branch, is a 2 km railway branch line off the Palmerston North-Gisborne Line that serves the Port of Napier. Napier Railway Station was the main railway station in Napier and an intermediate stop on the Palmerston North-Gisborne Line. It opened on 12 October 1874, when the station and the first section of the line between Napier and Hastings was opened. The line through the Manawatu Gorge to Palmerston North and hence to Wellington was opened on 9 March 1891. The line north of Napier to Gisborne was opened on 3 August 1942, with passenger services from 7 September. Napier was the terminus for both Gisborne and Wellington goods trains, though some passenger trains ran straight through. The original Napier station building was on the corner of Station Street and Millar Street, close to the centre of Napier. The facilities on the site increased to include the passenger station plus a goods yard, locomotive depot, workshop and a way and works branch. The line was on a curve and difficult to work, and the site was limited by level crossings at each end and with no room for expansion. Hence in a two-year programme to 1991 most functions followed the Way and Works to Pandora Point, at the start of the Ahuriri Branch, leaving only a new InterCity coach and train terminal on the city site, fronting Munroe Street. The old station was closed on 6 October 1990, and was replaced by a new station on 9 June 1991.Names & Opening & Closing Dates of Railway Stations in New Zealand by Juliet Scoble (2012) The existing station and three-story administrative block built in the late 1950s and early 1960s were demolished and some three hectares of land was available for retail development. A marshalling yard, freight terminal, locomotive depot and other facilities were established at Pandora Point, with a triangle provided to turn trains and giving direct access north and south from the port branch. The Ahuriri yard was closed. The old main line north to Gisborne was realigned to the east to allow a new link road to the Tamatea area of Napier, and railways land was redeveloped as an industrial subdivision. On 7 October 2001 the Bay Express from Wellington to Napier was cancelled and passenger services on the line ceased. Schools and higher education Napier has five state secondary schools: Napier Boys' High School, Napier Girls' High School, William Colenso College, Tamatea High School and Taradale High School. Other secondary schools include Sacred Heart College and St Joseph's MƒÅori Girls' College, both state integrated Catholic girls' schools, and Te Kura Kaupapa MƒÅori o Te Ara Hou, a MƒÅori language immersion school. The Eastern Institute of Technology in Taradale is the main tertiary education provider for Napier and the Hawke's Bay. Infrastructure and services =Utilities= The Napier Municipal Electricity Department (MED) established the city's first public supply in September 1913, using gas and later diesel engines for generation. Originally the city used a 230/460-volt three-wire DC system, later converting to the now-standard 230/400 volts three-phase AC. The city was connected to Mangahao in 1927 and to Waikaremoana in 1929. Taradale and rural areas around the city were supplied by the Hawke's Bay Electric Power Board, formed in 1924. In 1991, the MED merged with the Electric Power Board, later renamed Hawke's Bay Power. The 1998 electricity sector reforms saw the retail base sold to Contact Energy, with the remaining lines business renamed Hawke's Bay Networks and later Unison Networks. Today, Unison owns and operates the electricity distribution network servicing the city, with electricity fed from the Transpower substations at Redclyffe and, to a lesser extent, Whakatu. There is now a competitive electricity retail market, with Contact Energy and Genesis Energy being the dominant retailers in the city. Natural gas arrived in Napier and Hastings in 1983, with the completion of the high-pressure pipeline from Palmerston North to Hastings. The high pressure transmission pipelines supplying the city are now owned and operated by First Gas, with Powerco owning and operating the local natural gas distribution network. In February 2004, the city and wider Hawke's Bay region lost natural gas supply for six days after a flood washed away a bridge near Ashhurst supporting the high-pressure pipeline to the region.

The fourteener is located in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness, southwest by south (bearing 209¬∞) of the Town of Estes Park, Colorado, United States. Longs Peak is the northernmost fourteener in the Rocky Mountains and the highest point in Boulder County and Rocky Mountain National Park. The mountain was named in honor of explorer Stephen Harriman Long and is featured on the Colorado state quarter.The elevation of Longs Peak includes an adjustment of +1.652 m (+5.42 ft) from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88. Description Longs Peak (left of center), Pagoda Peak (center, in sun), Chief's Head (right of center, in shadow), and Mount Terra Tomah (at far right edge, in shadow), from above sea level in Rocky Mountain National Park Longs Peak can be prominently seen from Longmont, Colorado, as well as from most of the northern Front Range Urban Corridor. It is one of the most prominent mountains in Colorado, rising above the western edge of the Great Plains. The peak is named for Major Stephen Harriman Long, who is said to have been the first to spot the Front Range on June 30, 1820, during an expedition on behalf of the U.S. government. Together with nearby Mount Meeker, with an elevation of 13,911 feet, the two mountains are sometimes referred to as the Twin Peaks (not to be confused with a nearby lower mountain called Twin Sisters). History of ascents As the only fourteener in Rocky Mountain National Park, the peak has long been of interest to climbers. The easiest route is not \\"technical\\" during the summer season. It was probably first used by pre-Columbian indigenous people collecting eagle feathers. The first recorded ascent was in August 23, 1868 by the surveying party of John Wesley Powell via the south side. Addie Alexander was the first woman to summit Longs Peak in 1871. The East Face of the mountain is 1,675 feet steep and is surmounted by a 1,000 feet steep sheer cliff known as \\"The Diamond\\" (so-named because of its shape, approximately that of a cut diamond seen from the side and inverted). Another famous profile belongs to Longs Peak: to the southeast of the summit is a series of rises which, when viewed from the northeast, resembles a beaver. In 1954 the first proposal made to the National Park Service to climb The Diamond was met with an official closure, a stance not changed until 1960. The Diamond was first ascended by Dave Rearick and Bob Kamps that year, by a route that would come to be known simply as D1. This route would later be listed in Allen Steck and Steve Roper's influential book Fifty Classic Climbs of North America. The easiest route on the face is the Casual Route (5.10a), first climbed in 1977. It has since become the most popular route up the wall. The oldest person to summit Longs Peak was Rev. William \\"Col. Billy\\" Butler, who climbed it on September 2, 1926, his 85th birthday. In 1932, Clerin \\"Zumie\\" Zumwalt summited Longs Peak 53 times. The record number of ascents to the summit of Longs Peak is 428, by Jim Detterline. Jim was a rescue Ranger in Rocky Mountain National Park. On October 23, 2016, he died in an accident while solo climbing. Jim rescued over 1,000 people in the mountains of Rocky Mountain National Park and he received the U.S. Interior Department's Valor Award. He also, earned the title,\\"Mr. Longs Peak\\". http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web16f/newswire-detterline-obit On June 6, 2016, a group of US Special Forces were rescued after members of the team suffered from altitude sickness.NBC News  Mills Glacier  Longs Peak has one remaining glacier named Mills Glacier. The glacier is located around 12,800 feet (3,900 m)TopoQuest - Mills Glacier, USGS Longs Peak (CO) Topo Map at the base of the Eastern Face, just above Chasm Lake. A permanent snowfield, called The Dove, is located north of Longs Peak. Longs Peak is one of fewer than 50 mountains in Colorado that have a glacier. Climbing Longs Peak The Keyhole as seen from the Boulder Field. A small stone shelter (Agnes Vaille Memorial) approximately 10 feet (3 m) high that sits on the left side of the Keyhole gives a sense of scale. Trails that ascend Longs Peak include the East Longs Peak Trail, the Longs Peak Trail, the Keyhole Route, Clark's Arrow and the Shelf Trail. Only some technical climbing is required to reach the summit of Longs Peak during the summer season, which typically runs from mid July through early September. Outside of this window the popular \\"Keyhole\\" route is still open; however, its rating is upgraded to all \\"technical\\" as treacherous ice formation and snow fall necessitates the use of specialized climbing equipment including, at a minimum, crampons and an ice axe. It is one of the most difficult Class 3 fourteener scrambles in Colorado. The hike from the trailhead to the summit is 8.4 miles (13.5 km) each way, with a total elevation gain of 4,875 feet. Most hikers begin before dawn in order to reach the summit and return below the tree line before frequent afternoon thunderstorms bring a risk of lightning strikes. The most difficult portion of the hike begins at the Boulder Field, 6.4 miles (10 km) into the hike. After scrambling over the boulders, hikers reach the Keyhole at 6.7 miles (10.5 km). The following quarter of a mile involves a scramble along narrow ledges, many of which may have nearly sheer cliffs of 1,000 feet (305 m) or more just off the edge. The next portion of the hike includes climbing over 600 vertical feet (183 m) up the Trough before reaching the most exposed section of the hike, the Narrows. Just beyond the Narrows, the Notch signifies the beginning of the Homestretch, a steep climb to the football field-sized, flat summit. It is possible to camp out overnight in the Boulder Field (permit required) which makes for a less arduous two-day hike, although this is fairly exposed to the elements. Fifty-eight people have died climbing or hiking Longs Peak. According to the National Park Service, two people, on average, die every year attempting to climb the mountain. Less experienced mountaineers are encouraged to use a guide for this summit to mitigate risk and increase the probability of a summit. For hikers who do not wish to climb to the summit, there are less-involved hikes on the peak as well. Peacock Pool and Chasm Lake are popular hiking destinations and follow well-maintained trails. It is also rewarding to hike just to the Boulder Field, the Keyhole, or the seldom- visited Chasm View‚Äîthe ridge between Mount Lady Washington and the east face of Longs Peak. Camping is available at the Boulder Field and also on the lower portions of the mountain, such as Goblin's Forest next to the stream at the bottom. Technical climbers, with the correct permit, are allowed to use sites at the base of the East Face and at Chasm View. It is also possible to camp to the south of the mountain at Sand Beach Lake. Snowpack accumulation on Longs Peak In addition to the standard \\"Keyhole\\" route, there are more serious and more technical climbs on Longs Peak. Climbers should seek qualified instruction; deaths on Longs Peak are an annual occurrence. Some of the more common routes are, in approximate order of popularity, * North Face Cables route: This follows the Keyhole route to the Boulder Field, then ascends the North Face of the peak. It requires one or two pitches of low-5th class climbing, and is often downclimbed or rappelled by technical climbers since it is one of the fastest ways to ascend or descend the peak. In the early 20th century, enterprising guides installed a series of large steel eye bolts along this route, connecting them with a steel cable similar to systems in the Alps. The cables were removed in 1973 due to concerns about their appropriateness, but several of the bolts remain and are used as rappel anchors. * Kieners Route: A traditional mountaineering climb that involves a climb of Lambs Slide (named after Reverend Elkanah Lamb who unintentionally slid down much of the route in 1871), which is icy later in the season, then an exposed traverse of the Broadway ledge, and then low-5th class climbing. * via the Loft: The Loft is the semipermanent snowfield between Longs Peak and its southeastern neighbor Mt. Meeker. The saddle provides access to either peak. One such traverse route is Gorrell's Traverse.A Climber's Guide to the Rocky Mountain National Park Area, Walt Fricke, 1971 It is also possible to ascend to the saddle via Lambs Slide. * via the East Face: The East Face is the steep, 1,000 + foot (305 + m) wall that includes the Diamond and the Lower East Face. All climbs here are technical, from 5.10 to 5.13. It is also possible to ascend to the (climber's) left of the Diamond face proper. The routes on the right side of the Diamond are often aid climbed, and may require spending the night on the wall; the rock here can be very wet. Routes on the left side of the Diamond are usually free climbed. Only qualified climbers should attempt climbs on this face, and they should take into consideration the effects of altitude and alpine conditions in addition to the difficulty rating. * via the Notch Couloir: This is a technical climb involving rock climbing and, at some times of year, ice climbing. The Notch Couloir is to the (climber's) left of the Diamond face.

It can be difficult to make a software program portable: the C compiler differs from system to system; certain library functions are missing on some systems; header files may have different names. One way to handle this is to write conditional code, with code blocks selected by means of preprocessor directives (\`#ifdef\`); but because of the wide variety of build environments this approach quickly becomes unmanageable. Autotools is designed to address this problem more manageably. Autotools is part of the GNU toolchain and is widely used in many free software and open source packages. Its component tools are free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License with special license exceptions permitting its use with proprietary software. The GNU Build System makes it possible to build many programs using a two-step process: configure followed by make.  Components  Flow diagram of autoconf and automake Autotools consists of the GNU utility programs Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool. Other related tools frequently used alongside it include GNU's make program, GNU gettext, pkg-config, and the GNU Compiler Collection, also called GCC. = GNU Autoconf = Autoconf generates a \`configure\` script based on the contents of a \`configure.ac\` file which characterizes a particular body of source code. The \`configure\` script, when run, scans the build environment and generates a subordinate \`config.status\` script which, in turn, converts other input files and most commonly \`Makefile.in\` into output files (\`Makefile\`) which are appropriate for that build environment. Finally the \`make\` program uses \`Makefile\` to generate executable programs from source code. The complexity of Autotools reflects the variety of circumstances under which a body of source code may be built. * If a source code file is changed then it suffices to re-run \`make\` which only re- compiles that part of the body of the source code affected by the change. * If a \`.in\` file has changed then it suffices to re-run \`config.status\` and \`make\`. * If the body of source code is copied to another computer then it is sufficient to re-run \`configure\` (which runs \`config.status\`) and \`make\`. (For this reason source code using Autotools is normally distributed without the files that \`configure\` generates.) * If the body of source code is changed more fundamentally, then \`configure.ac\` and the \`.in\` files need to be changed and all subsequent steps also followed. To process files, autoconf uses the GNU implementation of the m4 macro system. Autoconf comes with several auxiliary programs such as Autoheader, which is used to help manage C header files; Autoscan, which can create an initial input file for Autoconf; and \`ifnames\`, which can list C pre-processor identifiers used in the program. = GNU Automake = Automake helps to create portable \`Makefile\`s, which are in turn processed with the make utility. It takes its input as \`Makefile.am\`, and turns it into \`Makefile.in\`, which is used by the configure script to generate the file \`Makefile\` output. It also performs automatic dependency tracking; every time a source file is compiled, the list of dependencies (e.g., C header files) is recorded. Later, any time make is run and a dependency appears to have changed, the dependent files will be rebuilt. = GNU Libtool = Libtool helps manage the creation of static and dynamic libraries on various Unix-like operating systems. Libtool accomplishes this by abstracting the library- creation process, hiding differences between various systems (e.g. GNU/Linux systems vs. Solaris). = Gnulib = Gnulib simplifies the process of making software that uses Autoconf and Automake portable to a wide range of systems.  Usage  Autotools assists software developers to write cross-platform software and make it available to a much wider user community, including in its source code form to those users who wish to build the software themselves. In most cases users simply run the supplied \`configure\` script (which has no dependencies other than the presence of a Bourne-compatible shell), and then a \`make\` program. They do not need to have the Autotools themselves installed on the computer. It can be used both for building native programs on the build machine and also for cross-compiling to other architectures. Cross-compiling software to run on a Windows host from a GNU/Linux or other Unix-like build system is also possible, using MinGW, however native compilation is often desirable on operating systems (such as the Microsoft Windows family of systems) that cannot run Bourne shell scripts on their own. This makes building such software on the Windows operating system a bit harder than on a Unix-like system which provides the Bourne shell as a standard component. One can install the Cygwin or MSYS system on top of Windows to provide a Unix-like compatibility layer, though, allowing configure scripts to run. Cygwin also provides the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU make, and other software that provides a nearly complete Unix-like system within Windows; MSYS also provides GNU make and other tools designed to work with the MinGW version of GCC. Although the developer is expected to provide a configure script for the end- user, occasionally the user may wish to re-generate the configure script itself. Such working might be necessary if the user wishes to amend the source code itself. Such users would need to have Autotools installed, and to use components such as its autoreconf. The autoconf-generated \`configure\` can be slow because it executes programs such as a C compiler many times in order to test whether various libraries, header files, and language features are present. This particularly affects Cygwin, which, due to its lack of a native fork system call, may execute configure scripts considerably slower than Linux. Criticism In his column for ACM Queue, FreeBSD developer Poul- Henning Kamp criticized the GNU Build System: Kamp sketches the history of the build system in the portability problems inherent in the multitude of 1980s Unix variants, and bemoans the need for such build systems to exist:  See also  * *Build automation *CMake *Gnits Standards *GNU Coding Standards *Waf *SCons *Meson build system *Qmake References External links *The GNU configure and build system *The pkg-config package *GNU automake documentation *GNU autoconf documentation *Combined manual for Automake and Autoconf *Autotools Tutorial *GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool *Autotools: a practitioner's guide to Autoconf, Automake and Libtool *A Guide to Integrating CUDA with Autotools *Autotools Mythbuster *Introduction to the Autotools Build automation Compiling tools Build system Software using the GPL license Unix programming tools ","title":"GNU Autotools"},{"id":"171985","text":"Louise Dresser (born Louise Josephine Kerlin;The Green Book Magazine Volume 9, page 523, c.1913 Retrieved September 7, 2016 October 5, 1878 - April 24, 1965) was an American actress. She is perhaps best known for her roles in the many films in which she played the wife of Will Rogers, including State Fair and David Harum. Early life Louise Josephine Kerlin was born on October 5, 1878 in Evansville, Indiana to Ida and William S. Kerlin (1849‚Äì1893),https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/27J5-4DC a railroad engineer who died when she was 15 years old. Career Dresser took her professional last name from Paul Dresser, who was a friend of her father. Upon finding out Louise was William Kerlin's daughter, he launched her as his younger sister, and she took on his last name. Many people believed the two were related, and when Paul died, Louise was mentioned in his obituary as a surviving relative. Dresser worked as a burlesque dancer and a singer at the Boston dime museum and then made her vaudeville debut in 1900. She formed a team named \\"Louise Dresser and Her Picks\\", a singing act that was backed by a chorus of African- American children. In 1906, she began to play New York vaudeville stages, and that year, she was in the musical About Town with Lew Fields, which was a hit. The following year, she was in the hit show Girl Behind the Counter, which ran for 260 performances. After vaudeville, Dresser's success continued on Broadway, where she starred with De Wolf Hopper in Matinee Idol (1910-1912), and appeared in Broadway to Paris (1912), Potash and Perlmutter (1913), and Hello Broadway! (1914). Her final Broadway show was Have a Heart (1917), which received good reviews. Dresser made her film debut in The Glory of Clementina (1922), and her first starring role was in The City That Never Sleeps (1924). In 1925, she starred in The Eagle, opposite Rudolph Valentino and Vilma B√°nky as Catherine the Great, and played the title role in The Goose Woman, alongside Jack Pickford. During the first presentations of the Academy Awards in 1929, Dresser was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for A Ship Comes In. In 1930, she acted as Al Jolson's mother in Mammy, and she portrayed Empress Elizabeth in The Scarlet Empress (1934). Her last film was Maid of Salem (1937). On television, she appeared in an episode spotlighting Buster Keaton on Ralph Edwards's program This Is Your Life. She had known Keaton since he was a small boy with his parents in vaudeville. Later years After retiring in 1937, Dresser worked as a volunteer at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. In 1950, Dresser attempted to make a comeback, but she was unable to get any screen roles, which she blamed on rumors of her being deaf. Personal life Dresser was married twice. Her first marriage was to singer/songwriter Jack Norworth, whom she married in 1898. The couple performed together in vaudeville, where Dresser earned a reported $1,750 per week. They divorced in 1908. She then wed Jack Gardner in 1910, and they remained together until his death in 1950. Neither union produced any children. Dresser died in Woodland Hills, California after surgery for an intestinal ailment. She had lost much of her fortune trying to establish a racing stable. Her gravesite is at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California.

Upon a jury finding him guilty, Peter finally breaks down in tears, but is soon back to his normal optimistic self in prison. His fortune improves when the real bomber, having suffered a guilty conscience, confesses to the police. His patriotism praised, Peter is released, gets his job back (with back pay), and returns to see his family. After a warm welcome, Peter is disheartened to learn that Eric has been killed in action. But his and Mrs. Pleznik's grief turns to pride when they remember Eric was just as loyal to his new country as they were; the film ends with Peter saluting his son's portrait on the wall.

It is named after the English city of Plymouth, Devon from where the first English settlers to New Zealand migrated. The New Plymouth District, which includes New Plymouth City and several smaller towns, is the 10th largest district (out of 67) in New Zealand, and has a population of ‚Äì about two-thirds of the total population of the Taranaki Region and % of New Zealand's population. This includes New Plymouth City (), Waitara (), Inglewood (), ≈åakura (), ≈åkato (561) and Urenui (429). The city itself is a service centre for the region's principal economic activities including intensive pastoral activities (mainly dairy farming) as well as oil, natural gas and petrochemical exploration and production. It is also the region's financial centre as the home of the TSB Bank (formerly the Taranaki Savings Bank), the largest of the remaining non-government New Zealand-owned banks. Notable features are the botanic gardens (i.e. Pukekura Park), the critically acclaimed Len Lye Centre and Art Gallery, the Coastal Walkway alongside the Tasman Sea, the Len Lye-designed artwork known as the Wind Wand, Paritutu Rock, and views of Mount Taranaki/Egmont. As described under awards, New Plymouth won multiple awards in 2008. The city was in 2010 chosen as one of two walking & cycling \\"Model Communities\\" by the government. Based on New Plymouth's already positive attitude towards cyclists and pedestrians, the city received $3.71m to invest into infrastructure and community programs to boost walking and cycling. It is also noted for being a coastal city with a mountain within 30 minutes drive, where residents and visitors to New Plymouth can snowboard, ski, water ski and surf all in the same day. History The area where New Plymouth was founded had for centuries been the home for several MƒÅori iwi (tribes). From about 1823 the Maori began having contact with European whalers as well as traders who arrived by schooner to buy flax. In 1828 Richard \\"Dicky\\" Barrett (1807‚Äì47) set up a trading post at Ngamotu after arriving on the trading vessel Adventure. Barrett traded with the local MƒÅori and helped negotiate the purchase of land from them on behalf of the New Zealand Company. Settlers were selected by the Plymouth Company, which was set up to attract emigrants from the West Country of England, and which took over land initially purchased by the New Zealand Company. The first of the town's settlers arrived on the William Bryan, which anchored off the coast on 31 March 1841. A series of disputes over ownership and settlement of land developed between MƒÅori and settlers soon after and New Plymouth became a fortified garrison town in 1860‚Äì1861 as more than 3500 Imperial soldiers, as well as local volunteers and militia, fought MƒÅori in the First Taranaki War.

The average annual rainfall is . On 15 August 2011 it snowed in New Plymouth, a rare event which has been described as a once in a generation occurrence. Governance =New Plymouth Province= The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 created the New Plymouth Province, with a Provincial Council given jurisdiction over an area of 400,000ha. Five years later the name of the province changed to Taranaki Province. The province was abolished in 1876. =Borough/City of New Plymouth= New Plymouth City Council Coat-of-Arms as used from 1949 A Town Board was formed in 1863 and in August 1876 the town was constituted as a borough. Its new status did little to overcome some outside perceptions, however. In 1876 author E. W. Payton wrote that \\"all the great bustling 'cities' of the colony had a patronising way of trying to snub New Plymouth, referring to it in such derogatory terms as the dullest hole in the colony ... nothing whatever to do there... I find a great liking for this 'slow, old hole' ... it is a quiet, unassuming place and has not done so much to attract immigrants and settlers by exaggerating reports, as some districts have done.\\"As quoted by J.S. Tullett, who cites \\"Early Days, Taranaki\\" by F. B. Butler (1942). The Fitzroy Town District was merged with New Plymouth borough in August 1911; Vogeltown, Frankleigh Park and Westown were added a year later, followed by St Aubyn-Moturoa. By 1913 the town had a population of 7538. Seafront land was added in 1931 and 1941; land acquired on Omata Rd was added in 1955 and in 1960 large areas including land to the south of Paritutu, as well as Hurdon, Ferndale and Huatoki were included, as well as land straddling Mangorei Rd between the Henui Stream and Waiwakaiho River. New Plymouth was declared a city in 1949. =New Plymouth District Council= In 1989, as a part of New Zealand-wide reorganisation of local government, New Plymouth City Council was merged with Taranaki District Council (Taranaki County Council and Waitara Borough merged in 1986), Inglewood District Council (Inglewood Borough and County merged in 1986), and Clifton County Council to form New Plymouth District Council. Every three years the Mayor, 14 councillors and 16 community board members are elected by the New Plymouth District's enrolled voters. The full council, sub-committees and standing committees meet on a six-weekly cycle. The Policy and Monitoring standing committees have delegated authority from the council to make final decisions on certain matters, and they make recommendations to the council on all others. The four community boards‚ÄìClifton, Waitara, Inglewood and Kaitake‚Äìas well as the subcommittees and working parties can make recommendations to the standing committees for them to consider. The third standing committee, the Hearings Commission, is a quasi-judicial body that meets whenever a formal hearing is required‚Äìfor instance, to hear submissions on a publicly notified resource consent application. The Chief Executive (currently Craig Stevenson) and approximately 460 full-time equivalent staff provide advice and information to the elected members and the public, implement council decisions and manage the district's day-to-day operations. This includes everything from maintaining more than 280 parks and reserves, waste water management and issuing consents and permits, through to providing libraries and other recreational services and ensuring the district's eateries meet health standards. New Plymouth District Council's annual operating revenue for 2008/2009 is more than $188 million. The current Mayor of New Plymouth is Neil Holdom. Industry and utilities Electric power was first provided in January 1906 from the Mangorei power station alongside the Waiwhakaiho River near Burgess Park. In the 1960s, the New Plymouth Power Station was initially designed to run on coal but constructed to be fuelled by natural gas or fuel oil. This is a thermal power station with a steam turbine, commenced operation in 1974 with units progressively decommissioned from 2000 with one left operating in 2008. Companies began searching for oil on the New Plymouth coast in 1865 after small deposits of thick oil were found on the shoreline. The first commercial quantities of oil were obtained in January 1866. Exploration continued sporadically and a refinery opened in 1913. Production ceased about 1972. The city was one of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the Kapuni gas field in South Taranaki entered production in 1970. The offshore Maui A well began production of natural gas in the late 1970s, sparking a flourishing energy and petrochemical industry. As Maui A's resources decline, new sites in Taranaki are being developed in an effort to find more commercial petrochemical reserves. Powerco operates the local electricity and natural gas distribution networks in the city. Electricity is supplied from Transpower's national grid at two substations: Carrington Street (Brooklands) and Huirangi. Natural gas is supplied from First Gas's transmission system at a gate station in Bell Block. Among the city's major industrial companies was Ivon Watkins- Dow, an agricultural chemicals company founded in 1944 by brothers Ivon, Harry and Dan Watkins and joined as a partner 20 years later by Dow Chemicals of Michigan. The company ran a factory at Paritutu making the herbicide 2,4,5-T. A 2005 study found that people who lived close to the Ivon Watkins-Dow plant between 1962 and 1987 were likely to have dioxin levels on average four times higher than the general public. In some groups the level was as much as seven times as high. A Public Health Medicine senior adviser has claimed that based on international findings, the residents' exposure to dioxin may cause increased rates of disease, in particular cancer. In March 2007 the Ministry of Health announced it would offer a major health support programme to anyone affected. In April 2008 the Ministry clarified that the programme's main feature would be a free annual medical check up for those who had lived, worked or studied close to the factory. Features and attractions Te Rewa Rewa Bridge which immediately became a symbol of the extensive cycling opportunities that have been created in and around New Plymouth. Coastal Walkway in New PlymouthThe Taranaki Salute to the Anzacs - statue in New Plymouth New Plymouth District has a reputation as an events centre, with major festivals (the annual TSB Bank Festival of Lights, Taranaki Powerco Garden Spectacular, WOMAD and the biennial Taranaki Arts Festival), sports fixtures (including international rugby, surfing, cricket and tennis matches, and the annual ITU World Cup Triathlon) and concerts (from Sir Elton John, Jack Johnson, REM, John Farnham and Fleetwood Mac). With its rich volcanic soil, the city is well known for its gardens. Chief among them are the 52 ha Pukekura Park in the centre of the city (named a Garden of National Significance), and Pukeiti, a rhododendron garden of international significance high on the Pouakai Range. Pukekura Park is also the home of the TSB Bank Festival of Lights, which runs for free every year from mid-December to early February. It has daytime and night time programmes of events for people of all ages, and the festival itself transforms the park into an illuminated wonderland every evening. Next to the foreshore in the central city is Puke Ariki ‚Äì the world's first purpose-built, fully integrated museum, library and information centre. Nearby is the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, a contemporary art museum. It includes the Len Lye Centre, a purpose-built extension to the museum that houses the collection of film maker and kinetic artist Len Lye, which opened in 2015. Retrieved 31 July 2019 The Coastal Walkway is a 13 km path that forms an expansive sea-edge promenade stretching almost the entire length of the city, from the Bell Block mouth in the east to Port Taranaki in the west. The pathway includes the iconic Te Rewa Rewa Bridge and is ideal for walking, running, cycling or skating, or simply enjoying the view of the dramatic west coast. It has won numerous awards, including the Cycle Friendly Award in 2008 for the best New Zealand cycle facility. Centre City Shopping Centre is the only shopping mall in New Plymouth. It contains over 65 shops and services. Awards New Plymouth won the Top Town award from North and South Magazine in 2008 (judged \\"the best place in New Zealand to live, love, work and raise a family\\"). The city also won three awards at the 11th International Awards for Liveable Communities held in Dongguan, China, 6‚Äì10 November 2008: * Whole City Gold award (population category 20,000 ‚Äì 75,000) * Criteria award for Community Sustainability * Gold award for community project (natural) ‚Äì the Coastal Walkway.  Transport  An railway link between New Plymouth and Waitara was completed in 1875; this later became the Waitara Branch. The next year, work began on a line south to Stratford, which was reached in 1879, followed by HƒÅwera in 1881. This line, known as the Marton - New Plymouth Line, was completed on 23 March 1885, and when the Wellington - Manawatu Line of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company was opened on 3 November 1886, a direct railway link was established to Wellington.New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 9‚Äì11, 15. The original routing through the centre of the town was replaced in 1907 by an alignment along the foreshore, which remains today. The New Plymouth Express passenger train began operating on this route in December 1886. In 1926, it was augmented by the Taranaki Flyer for the run between New Plymouth and Wanganui, A direct railway route to Auckland was not established until 1932, when the Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura Line was completed; the next year, when the line was handed over from the Public Works Department to the New Zealand Railways Department, the New Plymouth Night Express began operating to Auckland.J. D. Mahoney, Kings of the Iron Road: Steam Passenger Trains of New Zealand (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1982), 67, 71. All carriage trains were replaced by RM class Standard and 88 seater railcars by 1956. The Wanganui service ceased in 1959; the Auckland service was truncated to terminate in Taumarunui from 1971; and the Wellington service was cancelled on 30 July 1977. On 11 February 1978, the Taumarunui railcar was replaced by a passenger train, but it was ultimately cancelled on 21 January 1983. Since this date, the only passenger trains to operate to New Plymouth have been infrequent excursions operated by railway preservation societies. The breakwater at Ngamotu was completed in 1883, providing safe berthage for vessels, and the Moturoa wharf was completed in 1888. Port Taranaki is a critical transport link for the region and the only deep water port on the west coast of New Zealand. In 1916 the city's electric tramway system began and petrol-powered buses began running four years later. The tramway system was closed in 1954. It was replaced by trolley buses which operated until 1967. The first aircraft landed at the racecourse in 1920 and commercial flights began using the airport at Bell Block in June 1937. During World War II this grass airfield became RNZAF Bell Block; and was replaced in 1966 by the current tarmac airport, NE of the old airport site.  Emergency services  New Plymouth has two fire stations in the city with the central station a block away from the CBD. The station houses four fire appliances, including an aerial appliance, along with three specialist vehicles. New Plymouth Central Fire Station is manned by two crews (8 firefighters) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and responds, not only to the city, but to surrounding areas if needed. New Plymouth West Volunteer Fire Brigade is based west of the city in the suburb of Spotswood. The volunteer station houses a single appliance but is close to Port Taranaki and LPG/Gas tanks. The brigade supports New Plymouth and surrounding satellite towns. Police stations are scattered throughout the city with the main base at a modern police station on Powderham Street. Other suburban stations are located in Fitzroy, Westown and Bell Block. St John Ambulance supplies all ambulance services to Taranaki with their main station based at Taranaki Base Hospital. The Taranaki Rescue Helicopter Trust provides search, rescue and patient transfer missions when required. The AgustaWestland AW109 is based at its hangar at Taranaki Base Hospital. Port Taranaki is the home port for HMNZS Endeavour, although the ship is based at the Devonport Naval Base on Auckland's North Shore. Education There are three schools within the central city, and suburban schools in Fitzroy, Frankleigh Park, Lynmouth, Mangorei, Marfell, Merrilands, Moturoa, Spotswood, Vogeltown, Welbourn, Westown and Brooklands . The Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki has its main campus in central New Plymouth. In the inner city, New Plymouth Boys' High School and New Plymouth Girls' High School are single-sex secondary (years 9‚Äì13) schools with rolls of 1219 and 1218 respectively. New Plymouth Boys' High School was founded in 1882. The decile ratings of the two schools are 8 and 7, respectively. Central School is a coeducational contributing primary (years 1‚Äì6) schools with a roll of 212 and a decile rating of 8. Central School opened in 1884 and is one of the oldest schools in the region. In the suburbs are Francis Douglas Memorial College and Sacred Heart Girls' College, state-integrated catholic boys and girls schools (Years 7‚Äì13) respectively, while Spotswood College in the western suburbs is the only co-educational secondary school in the city. The largest primary school in the city is Central school with other primary schools scattered across the city. The only catholic schools in the city are St Josephs Primary, St John Bosco School and St Pius X School.

It lies beneath the eastern slopes of Mount Taranaki/Egmont, approximately halfway between New Plymouth and HƒÅwera, near the geographic centre of the Taranaki Region. The town has a population of , making it the 62nd largest urban area in New Zealand (using the Statistical Standard for Geographic Areas 2018 (SSGA18)), and the fourth largest in Taranaki (behind New Plymouth, HƒÅwera and Waitara). The Stratford District has a population of , and a land area of 2,163.35 km¬≤, which is divided between the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region (including the settlements of Whangam≈çmona, Marco and Tahora, 31.87% of its land area) and the Taranaki region (68.13% of its land area). Geography Location of the Stratford District = Road and rail = Stratford is at the junction of State Highway 3 and State Highway 43. On State Highway 3 New Plymouth is 39 km north, Inglewood 21 km north, Eltham 11 km south and HƒÅwera 30 km south. On State Highway 43 Taumarunui is 146 km to the east. This road is known as \\"The Forgotten World Highway\\", due to the scarcity of settlement along the road in contrast to its earlier history. A sign reads \\"No Petrol for 150 km\\". Stratford railway station is the junction of the Marton‚ÄìNew Plymouth and Stratford‚ÄìOkahukura lines. =Physical geography= Stratford's view of Mount Taranaki (facing west), with Fanthams Peak to the left of the main peak. Stratford is a service town for the many dairy farms of Taranaki. The Stratford District takes in about one quarter of the Taranaki Region, and includes four major geological features: the Taranaki volcanic cone, its associated ring plain, the Patea River catchment, and the eastern hill country. Taranaki Volcanic Cone The south-eastern face of Mount Taranaki is in the Stratford district, the north-westernmost point of the district being the 2518 m high peak. From the peak the boundaries run almost due east and due south. Pembroke Road winds up the mountain slope from Stratford to a carpark and lookout at \\"The Plateau\\", at 1172 m. Manganui skifield is a short hike from the carpark, across the Manganui Gorge. On the south-eastern face of the mountain, Manaia Road gives access to Dawson Falls and the Konini Lodge, at 890 m altitude. The natural Wilkies Pools are a short hike above the lodge. Taranaki Volcanic Ring Plain The Taranaki volcanic ring plain provides a steady contour with a subtle gradient, upon which Stratford and its environs have been settled. The easy gradient and rich volcanic soils and the high level of rainfall provide high quality pasture and agricultural land. Within this area the ring plain is drained by three river catchments: the Manganui River catchment to the north, the Waingongoro River catchment to the south, and the dominant Patea River catchment. Patea River The headwaters of the Patea River are on the eastern face of Mount Taranaki, above Stratford. From there the river flows eastwards, its upper catchment taking in a narrow area of land between the Manganui River catchment to the north and the Waingongoro River catchment to the south. Stratford is on the banks of the Patea River, at the junction of the Patea River and Paetahi Stream, approximately 15 km east of the headwaters. Due to the narrow width of the catchment, the southern boundary of the town is on the Patea/Waingongoro divide, while 4 km to the north Midhirst is on the Patea/Manganui divide. Beyond Stratford the catchment widens significantly to include a number of ancient swamps, including Ngaere and Toko, and also the Kahouri and Piakau ring plain streams. The river then takes in the expansive eastern hill country catchments of the Toko, Makuri, Mangaehu, Mangaotuku, Puniwhakau and Makahu Streams, before winding its way southwards through the hills of the South Taranaki district, to its mouth at Patea. Eastern hill country Beyond Stratford the district extends approximately 45 km to the east, between the Waitara River to the north and the MatemateƒÅonga Range to the south, with the Whanganui River and Heao Stream constituting much of the district's eastern boundary. This area is dominated by steep sandstone, greywacke and mudstone hills and winding valleys. Much of the steep and isolated hill country is in native or exotic forestry. The remainder of the district is in sheep and/or beef pastoral farming. Much of the eastern hill country falls within the catchment of the Patea River and its tributaries. However, to the north the district takes in Waitara River and its tributaries, including the Makara, Makino, Matau, Mangapapa and Mangaowata catchments. At its northernmost point the district also includes the Mt Damper Stream and its associated swamp and falls, which feed into the Tongaporutu River. In the east the district takes in the Whangam≈çmona River catchment, and also most of the Tangarakau River catchment, both of which feed into the Whanganui River. This area is separated from the west by the densely forested Whangam≈çmona Saddle, making it an isolated and distinctive part of the district, and the area once had its own county council. To the south-east the district also takes in the upper reaches of the Waitotara River catchment, within the MatemateƒÅonga Range and the Waitotara Conservation Area. =Surrounding settlements= Stratford is surrounded by a number of small villages and settlements. To the north on State Highway 3 are Midhirst and beyond that Waipuku, and to the south is the locality of Ngaere. Cardiff, Mahoe, Rowan and Pembroke are beneath the mountain to the west, and Wharehuia, Tuna, Te Popo and Kupe are to the north- east. To the east, along State Highway 43 and the Stratford-Okahukura railway, lie settlements that in their heyday were bustling villages. Toko and the renowned Whangam≈çmona have retained their character as villages, while the settlements of Douglas, Strathmore, Huiakama, Te Wera, Pohokura, Marco, Kohuratahi and Tahora now consist of no more than a few houses. Along roads off State Highway 3 are a number of other settlements, some of which were also once bustling villages. Huiroa, Kiore, Matau and Mt. Damper are to the north and west of the highway, and Huinga, Tututawa, Puniwhakau, Makahu, Aotuhia and Tangarakau are to the south and east. =National parks= Stratford is the gateway to two National Parks - Egmont National Park to the west, and Whanganui National Park to the east (via Kohi Saddle, Aotuhia). Population Stratford is a rural service centre, serving the agricultural economy of its wider hinterland. The population of the district peaked in 1961 at 11,300, and until the end of the century the town fluctuated between 5229 (2001) and 5664 (1996). The 21st century has seen significant economic growth and some associated population growth in the town. Stratford District had a population of 9,474 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 486 people (5.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 585 people (6.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,687 households. There were 4,722 males and 4,752 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. Of the total population, 2,043 people (21.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 1,635 (17.3%) were 15 to 29, 4,152 (43.8%) were 30 to 64, and 1,644 (17.4%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 91.4% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 14.2% MƒÅori, 1.4% Pacific peoples, 2.5% Asian, and 1.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 9.3, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 50.2% had no religion, 37.7% were Christian, and 2.5% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 669 (9.0%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 2,142 (28.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $28,700. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,672 (49.4%) people were employed full-time, 1,080 (14.5%) were part-time, and 270 (3.6%) were unemployed. Economy Stratford Farmers Butter Factory The Egmont Ring Plain provides steady contours and fertile volcanic soils which, together with the high level of rainfall, make for some of the best dairy country in New Zealand. The district is predominantly dairying (57,300 dairy cattle), while the rolling to steep eastern hill country supports dry stock farming and forestry (42,000 beef cattle; 281,300 sheep). The energy and tourism industries are both of growing significance to the Stratford District. The Stratford Power Station is located 3 km east of the town. History and culture =Whakaahurangi= The MƒÅori name for Stratford is Whakaahurangi, meaning to look to the sky. The name is taken from a story of the Ngati Ruanui chieftainess/Puhi Ariki named Ruapu- tahanga who, fled her husband Whatihua from Waikato, she travelled the track known as Te ara tapu o Ruaputahanga which stretches from Urenui down through Tariki, and ends near Patea). Here she stopped at the side of the Kahouri river near a fresh water spring. It is said she sat distraught and cried into the spring, naming it Te Puna Roimata o Ruaputahanga The spring of Ruaputahangas tears hear camped overnight 3 km east of the current town. Being a clear night, Ruaputahanga lay contemplating the stars when slumber overtook her. Withdrawing in respect, her followers observed that their chieftainess slept \\"with her face to the sky\\". The site continued to be used as a camping place for MƒÅori, the track she followed linking the south Taranaki tribes to those in north Taranaki, and further north to Kawhia. Each traveling party would recollect the story of Ruapu-tahanga sleeping with her face to the sky.Gordon, W.F., Battersby, J.H., Richards, J.B., Kennedy, W.L., and Kelly, C.S.. Carved from the Bush: Stratford 1878-1928. 1928. The name is fitting, given the exposure of the area to a broad horizon on the face of the mountain‚Äôs ring plain. =Surveying= There is no record of MƒÅori settlement in the vicinity of Stratford. Before British settlement the area was covered in dense forest and swamp. The Vogel schemes of the 1870s provided the necessary impetus to lead to the construction of a railway line south of New Plymouth, and the creation of road access at the same time, to open up access to the rich soils under the mountain. In 1876, Taranaki Waste Lands Board assistant surveyor Edwin Stanley Brookes, Jnr. cut a meridian line from Waitara to the site of Stratford, and oversaw the subdivision of a block between the Manganui River and the Patea River. The surveying of a new site for a town on the banks of the Patea River was authorised on 11 June 1877, and the northern half of the town (above the Patea River) was laid out by William Skinner in July. More lots were laid out by Peter Cheal in 1879, and in 1880 Skinner was directed to survey the southern half of the town. =Naming= Stratford clock tower \\"glockenspiel\\" On 3 December 1877, the name Stratford- upon-Patea was adopted, on the motion of William Crompton of the Taranaki Waste Lands Board. The supposed similarity of the Patea River to the River Avon in England led to the adoption of this name, and Crompton was known to have a literary turn of mind. There was a trend at the time to name towns after the birthplace of prominent British men. The William Shakespeare 'connection' led to the naming of 67 streets after Shakespearian characters from 27 of his plays. Today New Zealand's only glockenspiel clock tower plays the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet three times a day. The spoken words are provided via external loudspeakers - there is no carillon (multiple bells) as would be more typical for glockenspiels in towers. =Settlement and growth= Stratford was formally classified as a town in June 1878, and on 31 August 1878 an auction of 455 sections saw the first sections sold. By 1881 the population was 97, comprising 56 males and 41 females, with 22 houses. By 1891 this had grown to a population of 342 and by 1896 1,256. This growth continued steadily until the mid-late 20th century, and has since fluctuated between 5229 (2001) and 5664 (1996), numbering 5,337 at the last census. =Marae= Whakaahurangi Marae, a marae (meeting ground) of the NgƒÅti Ruanui tribe and its Ahitahi sub-tribe, is located in Stratford. It includes a wharenui (meeting house), known as Te Whet≈´ o Marama. Local government =Stratford District Council= Stratford District Council is one of 74 territorial local authorities in New Zealand. It is one of three territorial authorities in the Taranaki region, alongside New Plymouth District Council and South Taranaki District Council. The council is led by Mayor Neil Volzke. =History= The first Stratford Town Board was formed in 1882. The Stratford County Council was formed in 1890, and the Stratford Borough Council was formed on 22 July 1898. In the same year, Stratford became the third town in New Zealand to have electric street lighting, on the initiative of inventor and entrepreneur Alexander Walker Reid. The county and borough councils amalgamated on 1 April 1989 to form the Stratford District Council, which was reconstituted on 1 November 1989 as part of the nationwide restructure in local government. =Past mayors, chairmen, clerks and CEOs= Stratford Town Chairmen * George Newsham Curtis (1882‚Äì1885) * Charles Stuart Curtis (1885‚Äì1890) * Ebenezer Burgess (1890‚Äì1892, 1896‚Äì1898) * William Loftus Tocker (1892‚Äì1894) * J B Patton (1894‚Äì1896) Stratford Borough mayors * Harry Norman Liardet (1898‚Äì1899, 1902‚Äì1903) * Frederick James Steuart (1900‚Äì1901) * Reginald Brooking Tatton (1901‚Äì1902) * Nathaniel John King (1903‚Äì1907) * Pilcher Frederick Ralfe (1907‚Äì1908) * George A Sangster (1908‚Äì1910) * Jonas Masters (1910‚Äì1912) * William Patrick Kirkwood (1912‚Äì1915) * Josephiah Wedgwood Boon (1915‚Äì1917) * James Watson McMillan (1917‚Äì1929, 1933‚Äì1938) * Percy Thomson (1929‚Äì1933, 1938‚Äì1947) * Norman Harold Moss (1947‚Äì1957) * George John Wedgwood Boon (1957‚Äì1971) * Leo George Wellington Carrington (1971‚Äì1986) * Lachlan Grant Bond (1986‚Äì1989) Stratford County chairmen * George Albert Marchant (1890‚Äì1892, 1905‚Äì1912) * William Monkhouse (1892‚Äì1896) * Joseph Mackay (1896‚Äì1899, 1900‚Äì1905) * Richard Dingle (1900) * William Hathaway (1912‚Äì1917) * Edward Walter (1917‚Äì1925) * Thomas Rheese Anderson (1925‚Äì1938) * Joe C Best (1928‚Äì1946) * Bruce Hutchen (1946‚Äì1970) * Len C Harrison (1970‚Äì1977) * HH Paul Cook (1977‚Äì1983) * David Walter (1983‚Äì1989) Stratford District Council mayors * David Walter (1989‚Äì1998) * Brian Robert Jeffares (1998‚Äì2007) * John Edwards (2007‚Äì2009) (Died while in office) * Neil Volzke (2009-) Stratford Town Clerks * Thomas Harry Penn (1898‚Äì1902) * Ernest F Hemingway (1902‚Äì1911) * Phillip Skogland (1911‚Äì1936) * Gerald C Grace (1936‚Äì1975) * P A Tourell (1975‚Äì1985) * F W Bullen (1985‚Äì1989) Stratford County Clerks * William George Malone (1891‚Äì1900) * Charles Penn (1900‚Äì1931) * C L J Campbell (1931‚Äì1945) * T A Jones (1945‚Äì1968) * Ken J Little (1968‚Äì1975) * MD Bell (1975‚Äì1977) * Ross D Smith (1977‚Äì1989) Stratford District Chief Executives * Poiha Kemp Broughton (1989‚Äì2001) * Wayne Allan Kimber (2001‚Äì2004) * Michael Roy Freeman (2004‚Äì2011) * Sue Davidson (2011-2014) * Matt O'Mara (2015-2017) * Sven Hanne (2017-) Schools There are two secondary schools in Stratford: *Stratford High School is a coeducational secondary (years 9-13) school with a decile rating of 4 and a roll of 516.

Caldwell (titles), Katherine Hilliker (titles), Philip Klein, Marion Orth and Henry Roberts Symonds from the play Lady Cristilinda by Monckton Hoffe. As one of the early, transitional sound film releases, it did not include recorded dialogue, but used intertitles along with recorded sound effects and musical selections. Street Angel was one of three movies for which Janet Gaynor received the first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929; the others were F. W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans and Borzage's 7th Heaven. Street Angel was also nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. The acting award was given in 1929 and the other two in 1930, which accords the movie the distinction of being one of only two films to ever receive an Oscar nomination in two different years that was not a foreign language film. The other was The Quiet One nominated in 1949 for Documentary Feature and 1950 for Story and Screenplay. Plot A spirited young woman (Gaynor) tries to prostitute herself and, failing in that, to steal money, to pay for her seriously ill mother's medicine. She is caught in the act and convicted but escapes from her guards, only to find her mother dead. Fleeing the pursuing police, she joins a traveling carnival, where she meets a vagabond painter (Farrell). Though they fall in love, her past will not leave her alone.

For his scientific works he is regarded as the \\"father of transplantation\\". He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Famous zoologists such as Richard Dawkins referred to him as \\"the wittiest of all scientific writers\\", and Stephen Jay Gould as \\"the cleverest man I have ever known\\". Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction, he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\\".  Early life and education  Medawar was born in Petr√≥polis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon and British mother Edith Muriel (n√©e Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father's profession as selling \\"false teeth in South America\\".) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, \\"My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'.\\" Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \\"towards the end of the war\\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and had to renounce the citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He hated the college because \\"they were critical and querulous at the same time, wondering what kind of person a Lebanese was‚Äîsomething foreign you can be sure\\". And also because of its preference on sports, in which he was weak. An experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life \\"resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [Marlborough's] essentially tribal institution,\\" and likened it to the training schools for the Nazi SS as all \\"founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism.\\" His proudest moments at the college were with his teacher Ashley Gordon Lowndes, to whom he credited the beginning of his career in biology. He recognised Lowndes as barely literate but \\"a very, very good biology teacher\\". Lowndes had taught eminent biologists including John Z. Young and Richard Julius Pumphrey. Yet Medawar was inherently weak in dissection and was constantly irked by their dictum: \\"Bloody foolish is the boy whose drawing of his dissection differs in any way whatsoever from the diagram in the textbook.\\" In 1932, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in 1935. Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. He also worked at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology supervised by Howard Florey (later Nobel laureate, and who inspired him to take up immunology) and completed his doctoral thesis in 1941. In 1938, he became Fellow of Magdalene through an examination. It was there that he started working with J. Z. Young on the regeneration of nerves. His invention of a nerve glue proved useful in surgical operations of severed nerves during the World War II. Career and research Following his PhD, he was appointed a Rolleston Prizeman in 1942, senior research fellow of St John's College, Oxford in 1944, and a university demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy, also in 1944. He was elected Fellow of Magdalen by special election during 1938 to 1944 and 1946 to 1947. His Doctor of Philosophy thesis was approved, but the prohibitive cost of supplication meant he spent the money on his urgent appendectomy instead. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947. Medawar was Mason professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham between 1947 and 1951. He became Jodrell professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University College London in 1951. In 1962, he was appointed director of the National Institute for Medical Research. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, \\"[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce\\". He was head of the transplantation section of the Medical Research Council's clinical research centre at Harrow from 1971 to 1986. He became professor of experimental medicine at the Royal Institution (1977‚Äì1983), and president of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (1981‚Äì1987). = Early research = Medawar's first scientific research was on the effect of malt on the development of connective tissue cells (mesenchyme) in chicken. Reading the draft of the manuscript, Howard Florey commented it as more philosophical than scientific. It was published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology in 1937. Medawar's involvement with what became transplant research began during World War II, when he investigated possible improvements in skin grafts. His first publication on the subject was \\"Sheets of Pure Epidermal Epithelium from Human Skin\\", which was published in Nature in 1941. His studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war. In 1947, he moved to the University of Birmingham, taking along with him his PhD student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert Billingham. His research became more focused in 1949, when Australian biologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, advanced the hypothesis that during embryonic life and immediately after birth, cells gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own tissue substances on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other. With Billingham, he published a seminal paper in 1951 on grafting technique. Santa J. Ono, the American immunologist, has described the enduring impact of this paper to modern science. Based on this technique of grafting, Medawar's team devised a method to test Burnet's hypothesis. They extracted cells from young mouse embryos and injected them into another mouse of different strains. When the mouse developed into adult and skin grafting from that of the original strain was performed, there was no tissue rejection. Meaning that the mouse had tolerated the foreign tissue, which would normally be rejected. Their experimental proof of Burnet's hypothesis was first published in a brief article in Nature in 1953, followed by a series of papers, and a comprehensive description in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B in 1956, giving the name \\"actively acquired tolerance\\". = Research outcomes = Medawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 with Burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. This work was used in dealing with skin grafts required after burns. Medawar's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself, as in the attempt to suppress the body's rejection of organ transplants. It directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans, specifically kidney transplantation, carried out by an American physician Joseph Murray, who eventually received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. = Theory of senescence = Medawar's 1951 lecture An unsolved problem of biology (published 1952Medawar, P. B. (1952). 'An unsolved problem of biology' HK Lewis and Co.) addressed ageing and senescence, and he begins by defining both terms as follows: He then tackles the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms \\"reproductive value.\\" He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection weakens progressively with age late in life (because the fecundity of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by life tables, was an indirect measure of fitness, that is, the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes. Life tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence. = Theory on endocrine evolution = Medawar presented a talk on viviparity in animals (the phenomenon by which some animals give live birth) at a meeting on evolution at Oxford in July 1952. Later published in 1953, he introduced an aphorism: > Endocrine evolution is not an evolution of hormones but an evolution of the > uses to which they are put; an evolution not, to put it crudely, of chemical > formulae but of reactivities, reaction patterns and tissue competences. The notion that evolution and diversity of endocrine function in animals are due to different uses of each hormone rather than different hormones themselves became an established fact. The paper is also regarded as a pioneer in the field of reproductive immunology. = Personal life = Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Magdalen. Taylor approached him for the meaning of \\"heuristic\\", which she had to ask twice, and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy. They had two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise. He never knew the exact meaning of his surname, an Arabic word, he was told, for \\"to make round\\"; but which a friend explained to him as \\"little round fat man\\". Medawar was a scientist of great inventiveness who was interested in many other subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. He was renowned for wit and humour, which he claimed he inherited from his \\"raucous\\" mother. As he completed his PhD research in 1941, he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite ¬£25, to which he commented: > I'm an impostor. I am a doctor, but not a PhD... Morally I'm a PhD, in the > sense I could have had one if I'd been able to afford it. Anyway it was > unfashionable in my day. John Young [probably referring to John Zachary > Young] was not a PhD either. A PhD was regarded then as a newfangled German > importation, as bizarre and undesirable as having German bands playing on > streetcomers.\\" He was regarded as the philosopher Karl Popper's best-known disciple in science. Medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director Alex Garland. = Views on religion = Medawar declared: Although he normally sympathised with Christianity especially on moral teachings, he found the Biblical stories unethical and was \\"shocked by the way in which [Biblical] characters deceived and defrauded each other.\\" He even asked his wife \\"to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.\\" Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:  Later life and death  In 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual Reith Lectures‚Äîfollowing in the footsteps of his colleague, J. Z. Young, who was Reith Lecturer in 1950. For his own series of six radio broadcasts, titled The Future of Man, Medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve. While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. It was, as he said, \\"monstrous bad luck because Jim Whyte Black had not yet devised beta-blockers, which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career\\".Medawar P. B. 1986. Memoirs of a thinking radish: an autobiography. Oxford. p. 153 Medawar's failing health may have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government. Before the stroke, Medawar was one of Britain's most influential scientists, especially in the biomedical field. After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the Royal Free Hospital, London. He is buried‚Äîas is his wife Jean (1913‚Äì2005)‚Äîat Alfriston in East Sussex.Leslie Baruch Brent. \\"Jean Medawar's obituary\\" Independent, The (London). 12 May 2005. Awards and honours Blue plaque erected on 14 July 2014 by English Heritage at 25 Downshire Hill, Hampstead Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1949. With Frank Macfarlane Burnet he shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\\". The British government conferred him a CBE in 1958, knighted him in 1965, and appointed him to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1972, and Order of Merit in 1981. He was elected an EMBO Member in 1964 and received the Royal Medal in 1959, and the Copley Medal in 1969 both from the Royal Society. He was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science during 1968‚Äì1969. He was awarded the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1985. He was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1961 by the University of Birmingham. He was elected a member of the American Society of Immunologists in 1971, and elected foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959, the American Philosophical Society in 1961, and the US National Academy of Sciences in 1965. Medawar was elected President of the Royal Society for the term 1970‚Äì1975, but a severe stroke in 1969 prohibited him from taking up the office. Medawar was awarded the 1987 Michael Faraday Prize \\"for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture\\". Medawar has three awards named after him: #Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Medal, awarded by the Royal Society for excellence in a subject relating to the history of science, philosophy of science or the social function of science, in memory of John Wilkins, John Desmond Bernal and Peter Medawar. The winner delivers the Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Lecture. #Medawar Medal, awarded by the British Transplant Society in recognition of significant research in organ transplantation. #Peter Brian Medawar Medal, awarded by the State Medical Academy of Rio de Janeiro. The University of Oxford has established a research consortium named the Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research.  Books by Medawar  Medawar was recognised as a brilliant author. Richard Dawkins called him \\"the wittiest of all scientific writers\\", and New Scientist magazine's obituary called him \\"perhaps the best science writer of his generation\\". One of his best-known essays is his 1961 criticism of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's The Phenomenon of Man, of which he said: \\"Its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself\\".

The film stars Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore, and Raoul Walsh, and is one of Swanson's most successful films. Due to the subject matter, the making of the film was extremely controversial. However, it was a financial and critical success for Swanson. The film was based on the 1921 short story \\"Rain\\" by W. Somerset Maugham and the 1922 play that was based on the book by John Colton and Clemence Randolph, starring Jeanne Eagels. Plot A smoking, drinking, jazz listening, young prostitute named Sadie Thompson (Gloria Swanson) arrives at Pago Pago (American Samoa), on her way to a job with a shipping line on another island. At the same time, 'moralists' arrive, including Mr. and Mrs. Davidson (Lionel Barrymore and Blanche Friderici). They all end up staying in the same hotel, where the Davidsons plot to teach the natives about sin and Sadie entertains a bunch of Marines. Sadie begins to fall in love with Sergeant Timothy O'Hara (Raoul Walsh), who is not fazed by her past. He tells her that he has a best friend who married a former prostitute, and the couple now lives happily in Australia. Davidson sets about trying to redeem Sadie, much to her disgust. He tricks her into telling him about her past in San Francisco and, once she refuses to repent, he declares that he will go to the Governor and have her deported. Sadie is terrified of the threat, but O'Hara assures her that it will not happen. He tells her he wishes she would go to Australia and wait for his term of service to finish, after which they can get married. She agrees. Davidson gets his way, however, and Sadie is livid. She and O'Hara go to the Governor, begging him to let her go to Australia instead of back to San Francisco. Davidson has also managed to get O'Hara punished for being immoral, but Sadie will be able to go to Australia instead if Davidson approves. Sadie pleads with him, but to no avail. She eventually confesses that, if she goes back to San Francisco, there is \\"a man there who won't let her go straight\\", which is what she wants to do. Davidson figures out this mean that there is a warrant for her arrest back in San Francisco. Sadie claims that she was framed and is innocent, but will go to prison if she is sent back. Davidson still refuses, saying she must atone for her past. Sadie pleads and pleads and eventually offers to repent. Davidson, however, says that the only way to fully repent is for her to go to prison. Sadie runs to her room, crying out for Davidson. Davidson returns and Sadie confesses she is afraid. Davidson then tells her that, if she repents, there will be nothing to fear and he begins to pray with her. Sadie converts to Christianity. Sadie prays for three whole days. She has put away her old things and has become a modest woman. O'Hara returns and finds Davidson is gone, apparently \\"trying to stop the locals from dancing on the beach\\". O'Hara tells Sadie that he has a fishing boat waiting to take her and her things to a ship that will then take her to Australia, where they can marry and be free. Sadie is extremely afraid and refuses to go, saying that the \\"old Sadie is dead\\" and she must go to San Francisco and prison, to repent. O'Hara does everything he can, including forcibly taking her from the room, but Davidson is waiting outside. O'Hara tries to attack him, but Sadie asks him not to. O'Hara, extremely upset, leaves and Sadie pleads with Davidson not to get him in trouble, for \\"it was all her fault\\". Later that night, Sadie is asleep and everyone else is heading to bed. Davidson can not sleep and goes out for a walk in the rain. (It has rained almost continuously.) His wife says he cannot sleep for \\"the unpleasant dreams he's been having about Miss Thompson\\". A fellow boarder suspects they are not \\"all that unpleasant\\". Outside, Davidson struggles with himself and realizes that he is sexually attracted to Sadie and unable to handle it. He looks into her window and eventually returns to his room. Sadie, frightened because she heard noises, is waiting in Davidson's room. Davidson is shocked and sends her back to her room. The last reel is missing, but fishermen find Davidson's body. He has committed suicide. Sadie and O'Hara reconcile and head for Australia.

The production had been a disaster and Swanson felt it would receive a mediocre reception at best. On the advice of Joseph Schenck she relented and returned to Hollywood to prepare for a new picture.Swanson 1981 p.294 Feeling she would never have as much artistic freedom and independence as she had at that moment, Swanson decided she, \\"Wanted to make my Gold Rush,\\" referring to a recent film by Charlie Chaplin, which became perhaps his most celebrated work. Schenck pleaded with her to do a commercially successful film like The Last of Mrs. Cheyney. Swanson felt it too formulaic and decided to call upon director Raoul Walsh, who was signed with Fox Film Corporation at the time. Walsh had been known for bringing controversial material to film. At their first meeting, Swanson suggested a film based on the John Colton and Clemence Randolph play Rain (1923), which in turn was based on the story by W. Somerset Maugham titled \\"Miss Thompson\\" (1921). Swanson had seen Jeanne Eagels perform the role on stage twice and enjoyed it.Swanson 1981 p. 297 However, because of its content, the play was on the 'unofficial blacklist' and had quietly been banned from being made into a film a year earlier.Swanson 1981 p. 305 To try to avoid issues with the code, Swanson and Walsh decided to leave out profanity, rename 'Reverend Davidson' to 'Mr. Davidson', and claim it was for the sake of morality to produce the picture, as Irving Thalberg had produced The Scarlet Letter (1926) at MGM.Swanson 1981 pp. 297‚Äì302 Swanson invited Will Hays for lunch and summarized the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise that he would have no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus they were able to get the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000.Swanson 1981 pp. 302‚Äì304 When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made. Swanson and Walsh set about writing the script,Swanson 1981 p. 304 and discreetly placed an ad announcing the film, thinking no one noticed, as Charles Lindbergh had just made his historic flight. However, the press picked up on it and sensationalized the story. United Artists received a threatening two-page telegram from the MPAA, signed by all its members including Fox (Walsh's studio) and Hays himself. In addition, the rest of the signers owned several thousand movies houses and if they refused to screen the film, it could be a financial disaster.Swanson 1981 pp. 305‚Äì306 This was the first time Swanson had heard the name of Joseph P. Kennedy, with whom she would later have an affair and who would finance her next few pictures, including Queen Kelly (1929).Swanson 1981 pp. 308‚Äì309 Swanson was angered by the response, as she felt those very studios had produced \\"questionable\\" films themselves and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain.Swanson 1981 p.307 After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to MPAA and then the newspapers.Swanson 1981 p.309 She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he had a chain of theatres, this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson, which already had a quarter of a million dollars invested in it.Swanson 1981 pp.311-312 Before casting began, 17-year-old Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition for the role of Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson, but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he did eventually win the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash; which he did indeed do.Swanson 1981 pp.320-321 Despite this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not acted in front of a camera in eight years and feared he would not be able to both direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears were quelled.Swanson 1981 pp.317-318 Filming took place on Santa Catalina Island, near Long Beach, California. Swanson took ill shortly after and met a doctor who started her lifelong love of macrobiotic diets.Swanson 1981 pp. 313‚Äì317 A week into shooting, Sam Goldwyn called cameraman George Barnes away. Swanson was furious, but the loan contract allowed Goldwyn to call him away as he pleased. Not wanting to let a hundred extras sit around for days, Swanson and Walsh tried to hire two other cameramen, but both were unsatisfactory. Mary Pickford offered the services of her favorite cameraman, Charles Rosher, who was called in, but despite doing a decent job, could not match Barnes' work.Swanson 1981 pp. 319‚Äì320 Through Loew, MGM loaned Oliver Marsh, who completed the picture.Swanson 1981 p. 321 The entire cameraman problem was extremely costly to the production, yet the picture went on. With the picture half-finished, it was already way over budget and Schenck was wary, as Swanson's first picture had also been over budget and underperformed. Swanson talked with her advisers and sold her farm at Croton-on-Hudson, and offered to sell her New York penthouse as well. Despite reports that dirty words can be read on the characters' lips, Swanson claims the censors went over everything with a fine-tooth comb.Swanson 1981 p.322 However, Swanson admitted one line while she was shouting at Davidson went, \\"You'd rip the wings off of a butterfly, you son of a bitch!\\", when recounting a conversation with Walsh later in life.Swanson 1981 p. 499 If the word \\"rain\\" was used in a title card, the censors asked that it be removed. They also wanted to change Davidson's name to something else, but Swanson and Walsh refused. It was the first time Raoul Walsh had acted in 15 years, and it was his last appearance before the camera: He directed and was to star in his next project, In Old Arizona, While on location for that film a jackrabbit jumped through the windshield of his car and he lost his right eye in the resulting crash. He gave up acting and went on to an illustrious career behind the camera. Release and reception Sadie Thompson Lobby Card 1928 Upon its release, Sadie Thompson was praised by critics as was Swanson's performance.Welsch 2013 p.213 Contemporary film critics have cited Swanson's performance as one of her best. The film was a financial and critical success and was the only silent, independent film of Swanson's to do well at the box office. In fact, it was one of her last financially successful films, along with the sound films The Trespasser and Sunset Blvd.Swanson 1981 p.407 It made $1 million in the United States and $7 million internationally. However, at Kennedy's advice, Swanson had sold her distribution rights for the film to Schenck because Kennedy felt it would be a commercial failure. He also did not care for the image Swanson portrayed in the film. By this point, Queen Kelly had been a disaster and Swanson regretted it.Swanson 1981 p.374 The film made the top 10 best pictures of the year list as well. Awards and honors Swanson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and George Barnes for Best Cinematography at the 1st Academy Awards for this film, The Devil Dancer and The Magic Flame. Swanson did not attend the ceremony, and always felt it was like \\"comparing apples to oranges.\\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated Restoration and home media release The film was thought to have been lost for years. After Swanson's death in 1983, the sole known surviving print of the film was discovered by her estate; it had originally been stored in Mary Pickford's personal archive. By that time, the final reel had become damaged. The film was bought by Kino International, which hired Dennis Doros to reconstruct the final reel. Doros used the original title sequences, still photos and footage from the 1932 adaptation (which cinematographer Oliver T. Marsh also shot) to substitute for the lost footage. A new score by Joseph Turrin was also composed for the film.Moss 2011 p.451 Kino's version has been issued on DVD and online via Netflix, as well as shown on Turner Classic Movies.

Early life  Riwha was a subtribal leader (having succeeded his father \\"Tƒ´tokowaru\\") of the NgƒÅti Ruanui iwi in South Taranaki. A lot of what was accomplished by his father had been wrongly attributed to the son; being events of intertribal warring during his time of preadolescence. There is some mystery about his early life, but he is known to have become a Methodist in 1842 having been baptised and given the name of Hohepa Otene (named after the missionary). He joined the \\"King Movement\\" and fought in the First Taranaki War in 1860 and 1861. In 1865 and 1866, British troops conducted a punitive campaign throughout Taranaki, destroying numerous villages. Despite this, 1867 was declared by Tƒ´tokowaru to be a year of peace, \\"the year of the daughters...the year of the lamb\\", and he led over 100 of his followers on a peace march during the winter of 1867 from Waihi, near Hawera, down to Patea and Whanganui and ending at Pipiriki on the upper Whanganui River.\\"The year of the lamb\\" However, continuing disputes with settlers proved intolerable and in 1868 Tƒ´tokowaru went to war.  Tƒ´tokowaru's War (1868-69)  In June 1868 Tƒ´tokowaru's forces destroyed a colonist blockhouse at Turuturumokai, inland of Hawera. The colonial response was to send a large contingent to destroy Tƒ´tokowaru's stronghold. On 7 September 1868 the colonial forces were defeated with heavy casualties. The stronghold was then abandoned. Amongst the dead was the famous Prussian adventurer Gustavus von Tempsky. Turuturumokai was, previous to becoming a PƒÅkehƒÅ garrison, a small MƒÅori encampment, which had been found to be abandoned. Later after careful surveying, it was also discovered that, contrary to appearances, Turuturumokai was not as inconquerable as thought by British troops. The MƒÅori decision to leave Turuturumokai was a strategic move. Tƒ´tokowaru then advanced southward and defeated a second colonial force at Moturoa. He then stopped at Tauranga Ika and proceeded to build another fortress pa. This diamond-shaped fortress is considered the strongest ever constructed in New Zealand according to James Belich. It had numerous underground bunkers and tunnels, which could withstand heavy bombardment. There were three types of firing positions: trenches, loopholed palisades and European-style bastions from which fire could be directed along the frontages of the diamond. On the north-west corner was a tall lookout tower. At 5 am, on 2 February 1869, the advance party moved to within a few hundred meters of the stronghold and artillery opened fire. Maori returned rifle fire from within. Under cover of darkness, the colonial force closed the fort to within shouting distance. Both sides shouted and sang to encourage themselves until at 3 am the fighting reached a peak, gradually dying away until daybreak. At dawn, the army noticed the pa had gone very quiet. Three men approached the pa with great caution and found it deserted.  Later life  His later understanding of the needed union of two peoples (MƒÅori and settler) was incomparable. He advocated peace and diplomacy between the British and MƒÅoridom. He practised his own message, demonstrating great tolerance that was noted by many settlers and authority figures of his time. In 1886, he was part of a peaceful occupation of land near Manaia. Tƒ´tokowaru and nine others were taken to Wellington and, after being held in jail for two and a half months, were tried and sentenced to jail. He died shortly afterwards. Hailed as a war leader, prophet and peacemaker, Tƒ´tokowaru's story lapsed into obscurity before being popularised by New Zealand historian James Belich in his works on the New Zealand Wars. He is also the subject of a Maurice Shadbolt novel Monday's Warriors. The character, Te Kaipo, in the 2005 film River Queen, played by Temuera Morrison, is closely based on Tƒ´tokowaru.

The film was a box office success. For her performance, Pickford won the second Academy Award for Best Actress. Plot Norma Besant, daughter of a Southern doctor, is an incorrigible flirt and has many suitors. Her father Dr. Besant (John St. Polis) favors Stanley (Matt Moore), who is taken with Norma. However Norma has met a simple man named Michael Jeffrey (Johnny Mack Brown) who she has fallen madly in love with. Dr. Besant disapproves of Michael and orders Norma to never see him again. Norma gives him their word, then promptly plans to marry Michael in 6 months, when he's made 'good in the hills' so he can buy her a home in the valley. A few months pass and Michael sneaks down from the hills to see Norma at a Country Club dance. Wanting more time alone they sneak off to Michael's mother's cabin. According to Norma they made coffee and talked all night about the future. She returns home the next day at 4am. However someone has spotted the couple and begun to spread rumors around town destroying Norma's reputation. Michael is furious and vows he will ask her father for her hand in marriage immediately. Dr. Besant is furious and a heated verbal exchange takes place with Michael leaving, vowing to run away with Norma as soon as possible. Dr. Besant orders Norma to her room and leaves, pistol in hand.

The film was adapted for the screen by John Grey, Allen McNeil, and Sam Taylor from the play by George Abbott and Ann Preston Bridgers, and was directed by Sam Taylor. The play was based on real events in South Carolina and some dialog was used verbatim from court testimony. The play originally opened in New York City on November 8, 1927 with Helen Hayes in the title role. Though a product of pre-Code Hollywood, the film was severely censored during scripting. In the play, the leading lady is pregnant and the story hinges on the fact that she carries the child of the man killed by her father. Her father murdered the man because he asked to marry the girl. But to save her father from disgrace when her pregnancy becomes apparent, she preemptively kills herself. Wrote Ernst and Lorentz, \\"the censor conscious producer would not allow the movie to show the girl enceinte, thus destroying the whole plot.\\" William Cameron Menzies provided set decoration, or production design, with the film crediting him for \\"settings\\". Cinematography was by Karl Struss. The song \\"Coquette\\", written by Johnny Green and Carmen Lombardo, has since become a jazz standard. Place in Pickford's career Pickford had been one of the most popular stars in silent film. Her popularity had been steady since her debut in 1909. In 1916, she founded her own production company, taking control of every detail of her films. In 1919 along with Charlie Chaplin, her husband Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith she founded United Artists, giving her complete control over her films. Known for little-girl type roles such as Pollyanna (one of her highest- grossing films ever) Pickford had been trying to escape typecasting since 1923 with roles such as Rosita. However these films did not do as well as her child roles (though they were still successful at the box office), and Pickford had reverted to making films like Little Annie Rooney in 1925 and Sparrows in 1926. She tried an older role with her final silent film, My Best Girl in 1927 and, following the death of her mother in 1928, cut off her world-famous curls. With the arrival of talkies Pickford immediately took to the new medium, being one of the first major stars to do so. At her Pickfair Studios she installed a sound stage in 1928, and began preparing for her first talkie. She bought the rights to Coquette, a play that Helen Hayes had made popular on the stage. Coquette is the story of a flirtatious southern girl who chooses to stand behind her father after he kills the man that she loves. Much like My Best Girl the role was adult, with Pickford portraying a flapper type for the first time. Sound technology was extremely touchy at the time, with footsteps or rattling jewelry ruining takes. Cameras could barely move, and were hidden behind glass so as to not interfere with the sound recording. Pickford employed the best technology possible, resulting in a film that had more natural movement and acting than other early talkies. Despite Pickford's embrace of the new medium it seems she was as concerned as everyone else about how her voice would record, despite the fact she had a stage career before entering film. After reviewing her first sound test she reportedly remarked, \\"Why that sounds like a little pipsqueak voice!\\" She immediately began intensive vocal lessons, hoping to accomplish a realistic Southern accent for the role. Pickford became nervous during preparation, firing her sound man when a take wasn't ready for her review on time. On set during an emotional scene, she notoriously fired her longtime cameraman and friend, Charles Rosher, when he yelled \\"Cut!\\" in the middle of one of her lines. She didn't know at the time that a shadow had fallen across her face, as she was simply annoyed at being interrupted. Slightly embarrassed by her behavior and realizing she had been wrong, she wrote him a letter saying, \\"Tragedy is an ugly mask.

It was rewound and shown again, this time with intermittent, bad sound. Finally technicians were able to fix the problem and the film began again for a third time. Contemporary reviews were polite and warm. It was a box office success grossing $1.4 million. Coquette launched Pickford as a competent talkie star. Complete prints of the film still exist. In the 1990s it was restored by the Library of Congress and The Mary Pickford Institute. Pickford's estate no longer owns the rights as MGM (ironically parent company of UA) bought the film for a never-made remake. Coquette was released on home video by MGM/UA Home Video in the 1990s. At the time, it was owned by Turner Entertainment as part of MGM's pre-1986 library. Today it remains owned by Turner (under current parent company Warner Bros.), and has now been released on DVD via Warner Archive Collection.  Academy Awards  Pickford was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, of which her husband would be the first president. She was one of only three female founding members. The first Academy Awards were held in 1929, without any nominations for Pickford. She was nominated for Best Actress in 1930 for the 2nd Academy Awards. Many have accused Pickford of unfairly winning, using her clout and standing in the industry for an award of which she was unworthy. Pickford did lobby hard for the Oscar, inviting the judges over for tea at her home Pickfair. However her performance was critically and publicly acclaimed. Pickford would win another Oscar in 1976, an honorary lifetime achievement award. In 2008, a legal battle ensued between The Academy and Buddy Rogers's heirs over the sale of the Coquette Oscar. The heirs were trying to sell the award for charity, as stipulated in Rogers's second wife's will. The Academy insisted that the Award must be offered back to them for $1, to comply with a rule made long after Pickford won her Oscar. They claimed that when she won her honorary Oscar in the 1970s she signed a contract covering the Coquette statuette as well. The heirs argued that it might not have even been her signature, as Pickford was frail at the end of her life. The Academy won the legal battle, but announced they were willing to pursue a private agreement with the heirs. The outcome of this agreement is unknown.

Monona Terrace (view from Lake Monona) Monona Terrace (officially the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center) is a convention center on the shores of Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin. Controversy Originally designed by Wisconsin native Frank Lloyd Wright, it was first proposed by Wright in 1938. The county board rejected the plan by a single vote. Wright would continue to seek support for the plan (and alter its design) until his death in 1959. For the next four decades, various proposals for a convention center on the Monona Terrace land would be considered and rejected. Several times, it appeared that supporters of the project would be able to secure the public financing to complete the project, but various forces (such as the start of World War II) inevitably sidelined the plan. In 1990, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin resurrected Wright's proposal. Among the arguments against its construction, opponents argued that it was not a genuine Wright building, that the costs were too steep for the tax payers to bear and that the construction would adversely affect the environment, specifically destroying the view of Lake Monona from street level on the south side of the Capitol Square.Milwaukee Sentinel, Madison struggles with Wright choice for Center 1992-08-12. Retrieved 2011-04-21.Milwaukee Sentinel, Madison Votes Lean Toward Approval 1992-11-04. Retrieved 2011-04-21. Additionally, the site of the land stands on historic Ho-Chunk Nation burial mounds. The proposed construction was put to a public referendum in 1992 and it passed. Construction began two years later. In 1997, nearly sixty years after Wright's original conception, Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center opened its doors. Location Wisconsin State Capitol building overlooking Monona Terrace and the water fountain Monona Terrace is located two blocks from the Wisconsin State Capitol building in downtown Madison. From the roof of Monona Terrace, one can see views of downtown Madison, including the Capitol and a panoramic view of Lake Monona. Design Wright made several alterations to the design of Monona Terrace during his lifetime. Although the exterior design is Wright's, the interior as executed was designed by former Wright apprentice Anthony Puttnam of Taliesin Associated Architects. Construction The building was constructed by J.H. Findorff and Son Inc., a southern Wisconsin contractor . Facilities The facility hosts over 600 conventions, meetings and weddings each year that result in an average of $52 million in economic activity for the region. Monona Terrace also runs free community programs that serve approximately 56,000 people each year. Monona Terrace also offers guided tours, a gift shop, a rooftop cafe (warm weather months only), and serves as the home for some of the community's events including the national radio variety show Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?, Dane Dances, Ironman Wisconsin, and U.S. Bank Eve.

Set in mid-nineteenth-century New Zealand, it is a semi-fictionalized account of the story of the MƒÅori leader Te Kooti, told from the perspective of one of his pursuers, an officer in the colonial army. Explanation of the title The brief preface quotes Shakespeare's Shylock: ‚ÄúIf a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his suffrance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute; and it shall go hard, but I will better the instruction.‚Äù This lays the moral ground for the resistance of the band of New Zealand natives under their leader Te Kooti, who synthesized a new religion from Christian and MƒÅori traditions combined with his study of the Old Testament. His unique contribution was to declare his followers the latter-day embodiment of the Israelites escaping from Egypt. In the novel the rebels are often simply referred to as ‚Äúthe Jews.‚Äù The religion Te Kooti created, the Ringatu Church, still claims around 15,000 adherents in New Zealand today. Plot summary In this story of New Zealand and Te Kooti's War during the year beginning November 10, 1868, the narrative coalesces around the development of its protagonist, George Fairweather, who in Shadbolt's historical epilogue is described as ‚ÄúA composite character ... yet still far from fictional.‚Äù Fairweather is a competent but cynical former British officer in his early forties, who leaves the service under a cloud, turns landscape painter and cultivates an air of worldly detachment. Yet he finds himself drawn by love and humanity back into the world of colonial New Zealand and the maelstrom of the New Zealand Wars, not altogether disagreeable, as he finds to his surprise. Pursuing Te Kooti as an officer and commander in the colonial militia, while perfecting his ability to destroy Te Kooti's rebellious ‚ÄúJews‚Äù Fairweather paradoxically finds his feelings of humanity expanding to include Englishmen, colonials and MƒÅoris, coupled with a growing resentment of racism and injustice. In the end, he almost throws his future away by struggling to save a MƒÅori boy, Hamiora, who, like Melville's Billy Budd, was unjustly charged with treason. With the hanging of Hamiora, November 10, 1869, and the conclusion of Fairweather's desperate attempts first to prevent and then to mitigate it, the book ends. The problem of Te Kooti is not resolved, except in the brief epilogue, further revealing the depths of Fairweather's (and Shadbolt's) ambivalence about the historical figure of Te Kooti, Fairweather's hated and admired nemesis and one-time friend. Awards and nominations In 1987, the book received the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Award, a now-defunct national New Zealand book award, and forerunner of the current Montana New Zealand Book Awards. 1987 novels 20th-century New Zealand novels Novels set in New Zealand Ringat≈´ Hodder & Stoughton books W.

Along with Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco, he was one of the most famous of the \\"Mexican muralists\\". He was a member of the Mexican Communist Party, and a Stalinist and supporter of the Soviet Union who led an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940. By accordance with Spanish naming customs, his surname would normally have been Alfaro; however, like Picasso (Pablo Ruiz y Picasso) and Lorca (Federico Garc√≠a Lorca), Siqueiros used his mother's surname. It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state, but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua, but grew up in Irapuato, Guanajuato, at least from the age of six. The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol, who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros. Siqueiros changed his given name to \\"David\\" after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo's David. Early life Many details of Siqueiros's childhood, including birth date, birthplace, first name, and where he grew up, were misstated during his life and long after his death, in some cases by himself. Often he is reported to have been born and raised in 1898 in a town in the state of Chihuahua, and his personal names are reported to be \\"Jos√© David\\". Siqueiros was born in Chihuahua in 1896, the second of three children. He was baptized Jos√© de Jes√∫s Alfaro Siqueiros. His father, Cipriano Alfaro, originally from Irapuato, was well-off. His mother was Teresa Siqueiros. Siqueiros had two siblings: a sister, Luz, three years elder, and a brother \\"Chucho\\" (Jes√∫s), a year younger. David's mother died when he was four; their father sent the children to live with their paternal grandparents. David's grandfather, nicknamed \\"Siete Filos\\" ('seven knife-edges'), had an especially strong role in his upbringing. In 1902 Siqueiros started school in Irapuato, Guanajuato. He credits his first rebellious influence to his sister, who had resisted their father's religious orthodoxy. Around this time, Siqueiros was also exposed to new political ideas, mainly along the lines of anarcho-syndicalism. One such political theorist was Dr. Atl, who published a manifesto in 1906 calling for Mexican artists to develop a national art and look to ancient indigenous cultures for inspiration. In 1911, at the age of fifteen, Siqueiros was involved in a student strike at the Academy of San Carlos of the National Academy of Fine Arts that protested the school's teaching methodology and urged the impeachment of the school's director. Their protests eventually led to the establishment of an \\"open-air academy\\" in . At the age of eighteen, Siqueiros and several of his colleagues from the School of Fine Arts joined Venustiano Carranza's Constitutional Army fighting the government of President Victoriano Huerta. When Huerta fell in 1914, Siqueiros became enmeshed in the \\"post-revolutionary\\" infighting, as the Constitutional Army battled the diverse political factions of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata for control. His military travels around the country exposed him to Mexican culture and the raw everyday struggles of the working and rural poor classes. After Carranza's forces had gained control, Siqueiros briefly returned to Mexico City to paint before traveling to Europe in 1919. First in Paris, he absorbed the influence of cubism, intrigued particularly with Paul C√©zanne and the use of large blocks of intense color. While there, he also met Diego Rivera, another Mexican painter of \\"the big three\\" just on the brink of a legendary career in muralism, and traveled with him throughout Italy to study the great fresco painters of the Renaissance. Early art and politics Although many have said that Siqueiros' artistic ventures were frequently \\"interrupted\\" by his political ones, Siqueiros himself believed the two were intricately intertwined. By 1921, when he wrote his manifesto in Vida Americana, Siqueiros had already been exposed to Marxism and saw the life of the working and rural poor while traveling with the Constitutional Army. In \\"A New Direction for the New Generation of American Painters and Sculptors\\", he called for a \\"spiritual renewal\\" to simultaneously bring back the virtues of classical painting while infusing this style with \\"new values\\" that acknowledge the \\"modern machine\\" and the \\"contemporary aspects of daily life\\". The manifesto also claimed that a \\"constructive spirit\\" is essential to meaningful art, which rises above mere decoration or false, fantastical themes. Through this style, Siqueiros hoped to create a style that would bridge national and universal art. In his work as well as his writing, Siqueiros sought a social realism that at once hailed the proletariat peoples of Mexico and the world while avoiding the clich√©s of trendy \\"Primitivism\\" and \\"Indianism\\". Mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros in Tecpan, c. 1944 In 1922, Siqueiros returned to Mexico City to work as a muralist for √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n's revolutionary government. The then Secretary of Public Education Jos√© Vasconcelos made a mission of educating the masses through public art, and hired scores of artists and writers to build a modern Mexican culture. Siqueiros, Rivera and Jos√© Orozco worked together under Vasconcelos, who supported the muralist movement by commissioning murals for prominent buildings in Mexico City. Still, the artists working at the Preparatoria realized that many of their early works lacked the \\"public\\" nature envisioned in their ideology. In 1923 Siqueiros helped found the Syndicate of Revolutionary Mexican Painters, Sculptors and Engravers, which addressed the problem of widespread public access through its union paper, El Machete. That year the paper published ‚Äì \\"for the proletariat of the world\\" ‚Äì a manifesto, which Siqueiros helped author, on the necessity of a \\"collective\\" art, which would serve as \\"ideological propaganda\\" to educate the masses and overcome bourgeois, individualist art. Soon after, Siqueiros painted his famous mural Burial of a Worker (1923) in the stairwell of the Colegio Chico. The fresco features a group of pre-Conquest style workers in a funeral procession who are carrying a giant coffin, decorated with a hammer and sickle.Laurance P. Hurlburt, The Mexican Muralists in the United States (Albuquerque, N.M.: University of New Mexico Press, 1989), 203. The mural was never finished and was vandalized by students at the school who did not agree with the overtly political subject matter in the painting. Eventually, the entire painting was whitewashed by the new Minister of Education who succeeded Vasconcelos. But as the union became ever more critical of the revolutionary government, which had not instituted the promised reforms, its members faced new threats to cut funding for their art and the paper. A feud within the union over whether to cease publishing El Machete or lose financial support for the mural projects left Siqueiros at the forefront, as Rivera left in protest of the decision to uphold politics over artistic opportunity. Despite being let go from his post under the Department of Education in 1925, Siqueiros remained deeply entrenched in labor activities, in the union as well as the Mexican Communist Party, until he was jailed and eventually exiled in the early 1930s. Tropical America After spending many years in Mexico and heavily involved in radical political activities, Siqueiros went to Los Angeles in 1932 to continue his career as a muralist. Working in a collective unit that experimented with new painting techniques using modern devices such as airbrushes, sprayguns and projectors, Siqueiros and his team of collaborators painted two major murals. The first, Street Meeting, was commissioned for the Chouinard School of Art. It depicts a group of workers of mixed ethnicities listening to an angry labor agitator's speech during a break in the workday. The mural was washed over within a year of its unveiling‚Äîdue both to weather-related technical issues, and perhaps, to the pro-Communist content of the work. Siqueiros' other significant public Los Angeles mural, Tropical America (full name: Am√©rica Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos, or Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism),Del Barco, Mandalit. Revolutionary Mural To Return To L.A. After 80 Years. npr. October 26, 2010. Retrieved June 18, 2015. was commissioned shortly after the unveiling of Street Meeting, and was to be painted on the exterior wall of the Plaza Art Center that faced the busy Olvera Street. Tropical America depicts the United States' imperialism in Latin America, a much more radical theme than was intended for the work. Although it received generally favorable criticism, some viewed it as \\"Communist propaganda\\", which led to a partial covering in 1934 and a total whitewash in 1938. Eighty years later, the Getty Conservation Institute performed restoration work on the mural.\\"Conservation of Am√©rica Tropical\\" The Getty Conservation Institute website Accessed 14 November 2014 As no color photographs of Tropical America are known to exist, conservators used scientific analysis and best practices to get at the artist's vision of his piece. It became accessible to the public on its 80th anniversary, October 9, 2012.Whalen, Timothy P. (October 9, 2012) \\"Am√©rica Tropical Is Reborn on 80th Birthday\\" The Getty Iris The J. Paul Getty Trust The Am√©rica Tropical Interpretive Center that opened nearby is dedicated to the life and legacy of David Alfaro Siqueiros.Am√©rica Tropical Interpretive Center Official website Artistic career La Marcha de la Humanidad In the early 1930s, including his time spent in Lecumberri Prison, Siqueiros produced a series of politically themed lithographs, many of which were exhibited in the United States. His lithograph Head was shown at the 1930 exhibition \\"Mexican Artists and Artists of the Mexican School\\" at The Delphic Studios in New York City.Ruth Green Harris, \\"Art That Is Now Being Shown In the Galleries,\\" The New York Times, December 7, 1930. In 1932, he led an exhibition and conference entitled \\"Rectifications on Mexican Muralism\\" at the gallery of the Spanish Casino in Taxco, Guerrero. Shortly after, he traveled to New York, where he participated in the Weyhe Gallery's \\"Mexican Graphic Art\\" exhibition. Also in 1932, Nelbert Chouinard invited Siqueiros to Los Angeles to conduct mural workshops. It was at this time that, with a team of students, he also completed Tropical America in 1932, at the Italian Hall at Olvera Street in Los Angeles. Painting fresco on an outside wall ‚Äì visible to passersby as well as intentional viewers ‚Äì forced Siqueiros to reconsider his methodology as a muralist. He wanted the image ‚Äì an Indian peon being crucified by American oppression ‚Äì to be accessible from multiple angles. Instead of just constructing \\"an enlarged easel painting\\", he realized that the mural \\"must conform to the normal transit of a spectator.\\" Eventually, Siqueiros would develop a mural technique that involved tracing figures onto a wall with an electric projector, photographing early wall sketches to improve perspective, and new paints, spray guns, and other tools to accommodate the surface of modern buildings and the outdoor conditions. He was unceremoniously deported from the United States for political activity the same year.Langa, Helena. Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 2004. , . P. 234. La nueva democracia (\\"The New Democracy\\"), 1945, Siqueiros Back in New York in 1936, he was the guest of honor at the \\"Contemporary Arts\\" exhibition at the St. Regis gallery. There he also ran a political art workshop in preparation for the 1936 General Strike for Peace and May Day parade. The young Jackson Pollock attended the workshop and helped build floats for the parade. In fact, Siquieros has been credited with teaching drip and pour techniques to Pollock that later resulted in his all-over paintings, made from 1947 to 1950, and which constitute Pollock's greatest achievement. In addition to floats, the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop produced a variety of posters and other ephemeral works for the CPUSA and other anti-fascist organizations in New York. These ephemeral works possessed the ability to reach the masses in a way different from mural painting because they were accessible to a wide audience outside of an institution or gallery. The Siqueiros Experimental Workshop only lasted for a little over a year until Siqueiros went to fight in the Spanish Civil War in April 1937, but their floats were featured in both the 1936 and 1937 May Day Parades in Manhattan's garment district. Continuing to produce several works throughout the late 1930s - such as Echo of a Scream (1937) and The Sob (1939), both now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York ‚Äì Siqueiros also led a number of experimental art workshops for American students. He spent the better part of 1938 with the Spanish Republican Army fighting Francisco Franco's fascist coup before returning to Mexico City. After his return, in a stairwell of the Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas, Siqueiros collaborated with Spanish refugee Josep Renau and the International Team of Plastic Artists to develop one of his most famous works, Portrait of the Bourgeoisie, warning against the dual foes of capitalism and fascism. The original mural shows a giant generator using the opposition of fascist and capitalist democracies to generate imperialism and war. An armed, brave-faced revolutionary, of unnamable class or ethnicity, confronts the machine, and a blue sky on the ceiling flanked by electrical towers displays hope for the proletariat in technological and industrial advances. Attempted assassination of Leon Trotsky Manuel Su√°rez y Su√°rez and Siqueiros Before the mural's completion in 1940, however, Siqueiros was forced into hiding and later exiled for his direct involvement in an attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky, then in exile in Mexico City from the Soviet Union: Trotsky's 13-year-old grandson was shot, yet survived. Following the attack, police found a shallow grave on the road to the Desierto de los Leones with the body of New York Communist Robert Sheldon Harte, executed by one shot to the head. He had been one of Trotsky's bodyguards. The theory that Sheldon was a Soviet agent who had infiltrated Trotsky's entourage, aiding in Siqueiros' attack by allowing the hit squad to enter Trotsky's compound, was discounted by Trotsky and later historians.Robert Service. Trotsky: A Biography. Belknap Press. 2009. p. 485-488 Siqueiros's colleague Josep Renau completed the SME mural, transforming the generator into a machine that converts the blood of workers into coins.

Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1995. p. 85 Later life and works Unfinished 1940s mural painted by David Alfaro Siqueiros, in Escuela de Bellas Artes, a cultural center in San Miguel de Allende, Gto. Siqueiros participated in the first ever Mexican contingent at the XXV Venice Biennale exhibition with Orozco, Rivera and Tamayo in 1950, and he received the second prize for all exhibitors, which recognized the international status of Mexican art.Siqueiros, Biography of a Revolutionary Artist, (Book Surge, 2009)Leonard Folgarait, So Far From Heaven: David Alfaro Siqueiros' The March of Humanity and Mexican Revolutionary Politics (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 36. Yet by the 1950s, Siqueiros returned to accepting commissions from what he considered a \\"progressive\\" Mexican state, rather than painting for galleries or private patrons. He painted an outdoor mural entitled The People to the University, the University to the People at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City in 1952. In 1957 he began work on government commission for Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City; Del porfirismo a la Revoluci√≥n was his biggest mural yet. (The painting is known in English as From the Dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz to the Revolution or The Revolution Against the Porfirian Dictatorship.) In the lobby of the Hospital de la Raza in Mexico City, he created a revolutionary multi-angular mural using new materials and techniques, For the Social Welfare of all Mexicans. After painting Man the Master and Not the Slave of Technology on a concave aluminum panel in the lobby of the Polytechnic Institute, he painted The Apology for the Future Victory of Science over Cancer on panels that wrap around the lobby of the cancer center. Yet near the end of the decade, his outspoken communist views alienated him from the government. Under pressure from the government, the National Actors' Association, which had commissioned a mural on the theater in Mexico suspended his work on The History of Theater in Mexico at the Jorge Negrete Theater and sued him for breach of contract in 1958.Bruce Campbell, Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis (Tucson, Ariz.: The University of Arizona Press, 2003), 54. David Siqueiros mural: El pueblo a la universidad, la universidad al pueblo, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 1952‚Äì1956 Siqueiros was eventually arrested in 1960 for openly criticizing the President of Mexico, Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, and leading protests against the arrests of striking workers and teachers, though the charges were commonly known to be false. Numerous protests ensued, even including an appeal advertisement by well-known artists and writers in The New York Times in 1961.\\"Siqueiros\\" (advertisement), The New York Times, August 9, 1961. Unjustly imprisoned, Siqueiros continued to paint, and his works continued to sell. During that stay, he would make numerous sketches for the project of decorating the Hotel Casino de la Selva, owned by Manuel Suarez y Suarez. After international pressure was put on the Mexican authorities, Siqueiros was finally pardoned and released in the spring of 1964. He immediately resumed working on his suspended murals in the Actors' Union and Chapultepec Castle. When the mural planned for the Hotel de la Selva in Cuernavaca was moved to Mexico City and expanded, he assembled a team of national and international artists to work on the panels in his workshop in Cuernavaca. This project, his last major mural, is the largest mural ever painted, an integrated structure combining architecture, in which the building was designed as a mural, with mural painting and polychromed sculpture. Known as the Polyforum Siqueiros, the exterior consists of 12 panels of sculpture and painting while the walls and ceiling of the interior are covered with The March of Humanity on Earth and Toward the Cosmos. Completed in 1971 after years of extension and delay, the mural broke from some previous stylistic mandates, if only by its complex message. Known for making art that was easily read by the public, especially the lower classes, Siqueiros' message in The March is more difficult to decipher, though it seems to fuse two visions of human progress, one international and one based in Mexican heritage. The mural's placement at a ritzy hotel and commission by its millionaire owner also seems to challenge Siqueiros' anti-capitalist ideology. Style View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City As a muralist and an artist, Siqueiros believed art should be public, educational, and ideological. He painted mostly murals and other portraits of the revolution ‚Äì its goals, its past, and the current oppression of the working classes. Because he was painting a story of human struggle to overcome authoritarian, capitalist rule, he painted the everyday people ideally involved in this struggle. Though his pieces sometimes include landscapes or figures of Mexican history and mythology, these elements often appear as mere accessories to the story of a revolutionary hero or heroes (several works depict the revolutionary \\"masses\\", such as the mural at Chapultepec).Carolyn Hill, ed., Mexican Masters: Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros (Oklahoma City: Oklahoma City Museum of Art, 2005), 80. His interest in the human form developed at the Academy in Mexico City. His accentuation of the angles of the body, its muscles and joints, can be seen throughout his career in his portrayal of the strong revolutionary body. In addition, many works, especially in the 1930s, prominently feature hands, which could be interpreted as another heroic symbol of proletarian strength through work: his self- portrait in prison (El Coronelazo, 1945, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City), Our Present Image (1947, Museum of Modern Art, Mexico), New Democracy (1944, Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico City), and even his series on working class women, such as The Sob.

She is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York. She is tenth in the line of succession to the British throne, after her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. Early life Princess Eugenie was born at Portland Hospital in the West End of London on 23 March 1990 at 7:58 in the evening, the second child of the Duke and Duchess of York, and sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. On 30 March, the seventh day after her birth, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of York had named her Eugenie Victoria Helena. Buckingham Palace announcement, 30 March 1990 She was baptised at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, by the Bishop of Norwich on 23 December 1990. She was the first royal baby to have a public christening and the only one of the Queen's grandchildren not to be baptised in the Lily Font. Her godparents were James Ogilvy (her father's second cousin), Captain Alastair Ross (who was unable to attend), Susan Ferguson (her maternal grandfather's second wife), Julia Dodd-Noble, and Louise Blacker. Eugenie's parents divorced when she was six years old. When she was not at school, she spent her time with her family as the divorce had been amicable. The Duke and Duchess of York had agreed to joint custody of the girls. Eugenie and her sister frequently travel abroad with one or both of their parents. In the April 2008 issue of Tatler, Eugenie described her grandmother as \\"one of the most amazing women ever\\" and her parents as \\"the best divorced couple\\" she knew. In October 2002, the 12-year-old Eugenie underwent back surgery at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London to correct scoliosis; two 12-inch titanium rods were put in her back. She made a full recovery and was not expected to undergo any further surgery. Education and career Eugenie began her schooling at Winkfield Montessori from 1992 to 1993. From there she joined her sister at Upton House School in Windsor until 1995. She attended Coworth Park School from 1995 to 2001, and then St George's School, near Windsor Castle until 2003. For the next five years, Eugenie boarded at Marlborough College in Wiltshire. She undertook a gap year before continuing her education in 2009. Eugenie began studying at Newcastle University in September 2009, combining Art History, English Literature and Politics. She completed her studies in 2012, earning a 2:1 in English literature and history of art. In 2013, she moved to New York City for one year to work for the online auction firm Paddle8 as a benefit auctions manager. In July 2015, she moved back to London to work for the Hauser & Wirth art gallery as an associate director and was promoted to be a director in 2017. Activities Eugenie at her first engagement, opening Teenage Cancer Trust's unit in Leeds, October 2008 Princess Eugenie receives no allowance from the Privy Purse. She does, however, undertake occasional public engagements, which are usually connected with the charities she supports, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Children in Crisis. In 2018, Children in Crisis merged with Street Child, a children's charity active in multiple countries, with Eugenie still serving as an ambassador. Eugenie and her sister represented their father at a service of thanksgiving for her aunt, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 2007. In 2008, she performed her first solo public engagement, opening a Teenage Cancer Trust's unit for young cancer patients in Leeds. On 2 June 2011, Eugenie visited the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) with her father as one of her first official engagements. In April 2012 she agreed to be patron for the Hospital's Redevelopment Appeal, which was her first patronage. In 2014, Eugenie re-opened the children's unit at the RNOH. In 2014, she partnered with Daisy London Jewellery to create a limited edition charity bracelet to benefit the RNOH's Appeal. In January 2013, Eugenie and her sister, Princess Beatrice, visited Berlin and Hanover in Germany for a series of engagements. These included representing the Queen at the reopening of the former Hanoverian royal palace, the Schloss Herrenhausen, which was bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. In 2016, Princess Eugenie, along with her mother and sister, collaborated with British contemporary artist Teddy M to create the first ever Royal graffiti. The painting on canvas, titled Royal Love, was painted at Royal Lodge and exhibited in London prior to being sold for a five-figure sum. Proceeds from the sale of the painting were donated to the charity Children in Crisis. Princess Eugenie and her sister became Patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust in June 2016. She is also Patron of the Coronet Theatre, the European School of Osteopathy, the Tate Young Patrons and, alongside her mother, the Elephant Family, of which her uncle and aunt, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, are joint presidents. In 2016, Eugenie visited a safe house run by The Salvation Army and met with victims of sexual abuse and modern slavery. In October 2016, rumours of a rift between Prince Andrew and Prince Charles over the future roles of Eugenie and Beatrice were widely reported in the media. The Duke of York subsequently issued a statement describing the story as \\"complete fabrication\\". In 2017, Eugenie became the ambassador for the Artemis Council of the New Museum, a by-invitation membership initiative focused solely on supporting female artists. Eugenie also became an ambassador of Project 0 in 2018, a charity which in partnership with Sky Ocean Rescue, focuses on protecting the ocean from plastic pollution. In July 2018, in her capacity as director of the Anti-Slavery Collective, Eugenie spoke at the NEXUS Global Summit at the UN headquarters in New York to discuss ending modern slavery. In September 2018, she travelled to Serbia to visit ASTRA and ATINA, two grantees of the UN Trust Fund which fight against the issues of human trafficking and violence against women. In August 2019, it was announced that she would launch a podcast, the first member of the royal family to do so. Together with Julia de Boinville, co-founder of the Anti-Slavery Collective, they will highlight and discuss issues related to modern slavery. In October 2019, Eugenie became the patron of Anti-Slavery International. In May 2020, it was revealed that Eugenie and her husband were helping The Salvation Army with packing foods amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, Eugene became the patron of the Scoliosis Association UK. Marriage The Duke of York's Office at Buckingham Palace announced the engagement of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank on 22 January 2018. The couple had been dating for seven years, and were first introduced by friends in a ski break in Verbier, Switzerland, where Brooksbank was working. They were engaged on vacation in Nicaragua. In April 2018, the couple moved from St James's Palace and took up residence in Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace. The wedding took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 12 October 2018. The wedding dress was designed by the British fashion designers Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos of British-based label Peter Pilotto, and was designed to display her surgical scar. On 25 September 2020, Buckingham Palace announced that the couple are expecting their first child, due in early 2021.

Scullin led Labor to government at the 1929 election. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 transpired just two days after his swearing in, which would herald the beginning of the Great Depression in Australia. Scullin's administration would soon be overwhelmed by the economic crisis, with interpersonal and policy disagreements causing a three-way split of his party that would bring down the government in late 1931. Despite his chaotic term of office, Scullin remained a leading figure in the Labor movement throughout his lifetime, and served as an √©minence grise in various capacities for the party until his retirement in 1949. The son of working-class Irish-immigrants, Scullin spent much of his early life as a laborer and grocer in Ballarat. An autodidact and passionate debater, Scullin would join the Australian Labor Party in 1903, beginning a career spanning five decades. He was a political organizer and newspaper editor for the party, and was elected to the House of Representatives first in 1910 and then again in 1922 until 1949. Scullin quickly established himself as a leading voice in parliament, rapidly rising to become deputy leader of the party in 1927 and then Leader of the Opposition in 1928. After Scullin had won a landslide election in 1929, events took a dramatic change with the crisis on Wall Street and the rapid onset of the Great Depression around the world, which hit heavily indebted Australia hard. Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore responded by developing several plans during 1930 and 1931 to repay foreign debt, provide relief to farmers and create economic stimulus to curb unemployment based on deficit spending and expansionary monetary policy. Although the Keynesian Revolution would see these ideas adopted by most Western nations by the end of the decade, in 1931 such ideas were considered radical and the plans were bitterly opposed by many who feared hyperinflation and economic ruin. The still opposition-dominated Senate, and the conservative-dominated boards of the Commonwealth Bank and Loan Council, repeatedly blocked the plans. With the prospect of bankruptcy facing the government, Scullin backed down and instead advanced the Premiers' Plan, a far more conservative measure that met the crisis with severe cutbacks in government spending. Pensioners and other core Labor constituencies were severely affected by the cuts, leading to a widespread revolt and multiple defections in parliament. After several months of infighting the government collapsed, and was resoundingly defeated by the newly formed United Australia Party at the subsequent 1931 election. Scullin would remain party leader for four more years but the party split would not be healed until after Scullin's return to the backbenches in 1935. Scullin became a respected elder voice within the party and leading authority on taxation and government finance, and would eventually play a significant role in reforming both when Labor returned to government in 1941. Although disappointed with his own term of office, he nonetheless lived long enough to see many of his government's ideas implemented by subsequent governments before his death in 1953. Early life Scullin in the 1900s James Henry Scullin was born in Trawalla, Victoria on 18 September 1876. His parents, John and Ann (n√©e Logan) Scullin, were both Irish Catholics from County Londonderry. His father was a railway labourer, who emigrated to Australia in his 20s. His mother joined her husband in Australia later. James was the fourth of eight children, and grew up in a tight-knit and devoutly Catholic home. James attended the Trawalla State School from 1881 to 1887 and earned an early reputation as an active and quick-witted boy, though never physically robust. These characteristics would remain with him for life. The family moved to Mount Rowan, Ballarat in 1887, and the young James attended school at Mount Rowan State School until 12. Thereafter he held various manual odd-jobs in the Ballarat district until about 1900, and for ten years from 1900 he ran a grocer's shop in Ballarat. In his mid-20s he attended night school, was a voracious reader and became somewhat of an autodidact. He joined a number of societies and was active in the Australian Natives' Association and the Catholic Young Men's Society, eventually becoming president of the latter. He was also a skilled debater, participating in local competitions and having an association with the Ballarat South Street debating society for nearly 30 years, which would prove formative to his interest and talent in politics. Scullin was a devout Roman Catholic, a non-drinker and a non-smoker all his life. Scullin became active in politics during his years in Ballarat, being influenced by the ideas of Tom Mann and the growing labour movement in Victoria, as were many of his later ministerial colleagues such as Frank Anstey, John Curtin and Frank Brennan. He became a foundation member of his local Political Labor Council in 1903 and was active in local politics thereafter. He was a campaigner and political organizer for the Australian Workers' Union, the union movement with which he would remain most closely associated throughout his career. He spoke often around Ballarat on political issues and helped with Labor campaigns at state and federal level. At the 1906 federal election he was selected as the Labor candidate for the seat of Ballarat against then Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. Although a race in which Labor had virtually no chance of winning, Scullin ran a spirited campaign and impressed those within the movement for his efforts. On 11 November 1907 he married Sarah Maria McNamara, a dressmaker from Ballarat. The marriage was childless. Due to Scullin's frequent and often serious bouts of illness over his long career, Sarah served the role as her husband's protector and was a crucial source of support and care for her husband, particularly in his final years. She was frequently called to assist or stand in for her husband at social occasions when her husband's illness prevented him from attending personally. She was an active member of the Labor Party herself, and would remain well-informed on politics. Very unusually among Australian political spouses (and even more so during the period of her husband's career), Sarah would often attend parliamentary sessions, and would even be present during the debate and vote that brought her husband's government down. Political career Scullin following his election as MP in 1910. In 1910 Scullin won his first election as the Labor candidate in Corangamite, in a year when Labor's Andrew Fisher surged in the polls and formed Australia's first majority government. Scullin had done much to personally build the grass-roots organisation of the Labor movement in this seat in the years prior to the election, although its rural character meant it was not considered a seat naturally sympathetic to Labor. His campaign focused on increasing the powers of the Federal parliament and issues such as defending a white Australia, higher import duties and the introduction of a land tax. In federal parliament, Scullin quickly earned a reputation as an impressive and formidable parliamentary debater. He spoke on a wide range of issues over the three years of his term, but concentrated especially on matters relating to taxation and the powers of the Commonwealth, both of which would become signature issues for Scullin throughout his career. By the end of his first year in parliament he had a reputation as \\"one of the most ardent land-taxers in the Labor party\\" and had spoken frequently on breaking up \\"the land monopoly which has for so many years retarded the growth of this young country.\\" Scullin enthusiastically supported Fisher's referendum questions in expand Commonwealth power over in 1911 and again in 1913, though in both cases all amendment proposals were rejected by comfortable majorities. Although he was well regarded in his district and hard-working and ardent, it was not enough to shield him from Joseph Cook's resurgent and now united conservative forces in the election of 1913, and Scullin suffered the fate of many Labor members in rural districts at that year's election. He tried and failed to reacquire the seat at the 1918 Corangamite by-election. After defeat Scullin was appointed as editor of the Evening Echo, a daily newspaper owned by the Australian Workers Union in Ballarat. He would hold this position for the next nine years, which solidified his position within the Victorian Labor movement and made him an influential voice within its ranks, being elected president of the Victorian state branch of Labor in 1918. He and his paper became leading voices against conscription in Victoria during World War I, and a forceful intellectual contributor to the party during the Billy Hughes years. At the special Labor conference on conscription in 1916, Scullin moved for the expulsion of the conscriptionists, including Prime Minister Hughes and former prime minister Chris Watson. During these years Scullin earned a reputation as a socialist on the left-wing of the party and had radicalised in some of his opinions, particularly his sentiments against imperial domination from London. Scullin was fiercely patriotic and critical of the war, particularly Britain's leadership of the dominions within it. In the early 1920s Scullin was prominent in the push for the party to adopt economic socialisation policies as part of its platform. Scullin during the 1920s. Scullin with his future deputy Frank Forde. The death of federal Labor leader Frank Tudor left a vacancy in the very safe urban seat of Yarra in Melbourne. Scullin handily won Labor preselection over several other candidates, and in February 1922 he took the seat at the ensuing by-election with more than three-quarters of the vote. With his win, he and his family to relocated to Richmond, away from his long- time home of Ballarat, and to an electorate completely different in character to his earlier seat of Corangamite. However his new proximity to the Federal parliament (still located in Melbourne) and representation of a safe seat afforded many more political opportunities and freedoms, and soon Scullin was a prominent figure on the Labor campaign trail and appearing at events around the country. In these years Scullin's renown increased considerably within the party and the nation at large. He became one of the leading lights of the parliamentary opposition, and was quickly elevated to the party executive in February 1923. During his years as an opposition backbencher, Scullin spoke frequently and passionately. He was an able debater and parliamentary performer, but also carved out a niche as a leading voice on several issues, particularly taxation and economic policy. Some of Scullin's charges on land- tax avoidance by wealthy pastoralists were so damning that the Bruce government called a Royal Commission specifically to investigate his claims. Scullin's competence on financial matters proved useful to the government as well, and several of his suggestions from the opposition bench made their way into government legislation. In March 1927 Scullin became the parliamentary ALP's deputy leader. Leader of the Opposition Scullin as Opposition leader in October 1928. As Deputy Leader, Scullin excelled in taking the case to the government. Throughout 1927 Scullin earned particular acclaim in keeping the ageing Bruce government to account on economic and financial matters. A series of speeches by Scullin that year on the Government's mishandling of the economy, and the generally dangerous trajectory of Commonwealth financial policy, predicted catastrophe. He accused the government of spending too much, borrowing too much from overseas sources, and not rectifying a worrying excess of imports over exports: a three-part recipe for disaster. This alarming analysis of the Australian economy would prove to be correct within three years, however relatively few paid attention to Scullin's warning at the time, nor the prescient 1927 volume The Boom of 1890 ‚Äì And Now by E.O.G. Shann, on which Scullin based many of his arguments. In March 1928, Matthew Charlton resigned as federal Labor leader and was replaced by Scullin in a unanimous motion, although some had their eye on newcomer Ted Theodore as a more promising replacement. The ensuing contest over the position of Deputy Leader saw Theodore denied once again in a close vote, foreshadowing some of the future controversy he would stir up within the party under Scullin. Scullin led Labor at the 1928 election. He visited widely around the country, and made especial focus on Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland ‚Äì states where the Labor party's fortunes had greatly declined in previous years. Scullin was well received and made ground in these areas, as well as in rural districts to counteract the increasingly urban nature of Labor. Labor managed to take eight seats, significantly reducing the Coalition's previously large majority. This was due to a swing against the government rather than a swing towards Labor, but was still enough to put Labor within striking distance of winning the next election. Although Labor came up well short of forming government, the campaign was viewed as a success and Scullin's reputation remained intact as leader. 1929 was dogged by industrial disputes, the worst of which occurred within the waterfront, timber and coalmining sectors. The Bruce government struggled to manage these episodes ‚Äì its proposal by referendum for greater Commonwealth industrial powers had been rejected in 1926. After months of deadlock and protests over decisions of the Federal Arbitration Court, Bruce reversed course entirely by proposing that the Commonwealth dismantle federal arbitration and hand industrial matters back entirely to the states. The proposal was a radical departure from one of the pillars of the so-called \\"Australian settlement\\", and several MPs, led by former PM Billy Hughes, ultimately voted against the government and forced Bruce to seek an additional mandate from the people, at the 1929 election. Crucially, it would be a House- only election as the 1925 Senate term had not expired. Just 9 months after the previous campaign, Australia was in campaign mode once more. Amidst a background of industrial strife and heavy handed government proposals to deal with it, Scullin, who preached conciliation and negotiation between the parties, seemed the moderate choice, despite the more radical stances otherwise held by Labor. Fighting on their home territory and in favour of what was a still popular status-quo in industrial relations law, Scullin and Labor romped home in the polls, winning 46 seats in the 75 seat chamber, the most they had ever won at the time. Labor even managed to oust Bruce in his own seat. The party was jubilant and Scullin enthusiastically accepted commission to become Prime Minister. He was to be Australia's first Catholic prime minister. Prime Minister New Prime Minister James Scullin and former Prime Minister Stanley Bruce hold a private meeting after Scullin's swearing- in as Prime Minister, 1929 The Scullin Government sworn in, October 1929 Scullin came to Canberra amidst rapturous applause from his supporters and the largest majority that Labor had ever won at the time. However, the party had many diverse interests and factions within it, ranging from metropolitan socialist radicals to rural professional politicians. The Scullin administration immediately rolled back several of the Bruce government's measures deemed to be anti-labor ‚Äì including changes made to industrial arbitration and competition, and the immediate abolition of compulsory military training. Scullin also chose not to take residence in The Lodge, which had only been completed two years prior, citing its unnecessary extravagance and cost to the taxpayer. In 1929, the Scullin Government established the Canberra University College.The Whitlam Government 1972‚Äì1975 by Gough Whitlam But the government's attention would soon shift to the economy. On the very day Scullin arrived in Canberra after the 1929 election, The Sydney Morning Herald announced large losses on Wall Street. On 24 October, two days after Scullin's cabinet was sworn in, news of Black Thursday reached Australia and the government. The effect these developments would have on the Australian economy were not yet known, as economic conditions were already agreed to be poor, but the portents of future disaster were there. Three of the last four Commonwealth budgets had been in substantial arrears funded by overseas borrowing, and the value of Australian debt had been steadily declining in foreign markets. Sluggish years for the agricultural and manufacturing sectors were compounding the problem, but the most worrying statistic was unemployment, which was just over 13% at the end of 1929. A further problem was the decline in Australian trade. Price for wool and wheat ‚Äì Australia's two principal exports ‚Äì had fallen by almost a third during 1929. With debts rising and the ability to repay diminishing, Australia was faced with a seriously troubled financial outlook when Scullin took office. Scullin's government faced significant limitations on its power to implement its response to the economic crisis. There had been no half-Senate election in 1929, meaning that the Nationalist majority elected at the 1928 election was still in place. The conservative Senate proved hostile to much of Labor's economic program. Scullin also had to contend with a financial establishment in Australia (most notably Commonwealth Bank Board chairman Sir Robert Gibson) and in the United Kingdom (such as Bank of England representative Sir Otto Niemeyer) that was firmly opposed to any deviation from orthodox economics in responding to the Great Depression. On the contrary, there was much disagreement with Scullin's parliamentary party as to how to respond to the crisis, and a great many were sympathetic to the then radical ideas of inflationary finance and other proto-Keynesian approaches. Furthermore, Scullin and his Treasurer Ted Theodore were vehemently opposed to suggestions from the Opposition and Commonwealth Bank to reduce the deficit by cutting Federal welfare emoluments. Thus began two-years of clashes between the government and its opponents, which would prove to be some of the most turbulent in Australian political history. =Crisis and deadlock= Prime Minister Scullin in 1930 Scullin with Treasurer Ted Theodore in December 1929 Ongoing industrial disputes on the coalfields of the Hunter Valley and Newcastle dragged on throughout Scullin's government, the Commonwealth lacking the power to coerce a solution and numerous negotiations between owners and workers collapsed. As a Labor Prime Minister, expectations ran high that Scullin would force the mine owners to submit to worker demands. Scullin was sympathetic, but refused to go beyond negotiations and inducements to end the disputes. Many within the New South Wales Labor branch were infuriated and felt they had been betrayed, catalysing a beginning of a separation between the state branch (led by fiery demagogue Jack Lang) and the federal party led by Scullin. Heavily indebted and with conditions worsening, Scullin and Theodore took many novel steps in an attempt to turn the economy around. Appeals were made, both to the Australian public and on overseas markets, to bolster confidence and boost government bond subscriptions. A \\"Grow More Wheat\\" campaign was launched in 1930 to encourage farmers to plant a record crop and attempt to improve Australia's serious trade deficit, although ultimately Scullin was unsuccessful in convincing the Senate or the Commonwealth Bank to support this program through price guarantees. At the same time unemployment had hit a record high of 14.6% in the March quarter of 1930. Scullin's election promise of unemployment insurance was discussed in this period, but with dire predictions for government finance the promise was continually stalled. Scullin made major proposals to change the constitutional amendment process; expand Commonwealth powers over commerce, trade and industry; and to break apart the Commonwealth Bank to separate out its reserve bank and trading bank functions. The Senate blocked them all, or made amendments which rendered them unrecognisable. A double dissolution was threatened, though for various reasons both practical and political, Scullin never took this step. In June 1930 the government suffered a heavy loss when Theodore was forced to resign after he was criticised by a Royal Commission enquiring into a scandal known as the Mungana affair, claims of corrupt deals dating back to Theodore's time as Premier of Queensland. Scullin took over the Treasury portfolio in the interim while Theodore went to Queensland to face charges, and was compelled to bring down the 1930 budget personally. Sarah in about 1930 Tarred with the political scandal, the budget, which raised taxes, cut spending and still did not deliver a surplus, was very unpopular with all sections of the community. What is more, the budget proved overly optimistic as Australian revenues continued to plunge and the deficit rose. By August 1930, crisis meetings were held in which Sir Robert Gibson and Sir Otto Niemeyer were demanding further economies in Commonwealth spending. Niemeyer, a representative of the Bank of England, had arrived in Australia to inspect financial conditions on behalf of creditors and had a grim report ‚Äì that \\"Australian credit is at a low ebb...lower than that of any of the other dominions\\" and that without drastic steps default and financial collapse was assured. Gibson agreed, and as Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board had the power to deny the Australian government loans to finance the budget unless more cuts were made by both the national and state governments. After meeting with Scullin and state premiers, the 'Melbourne Agreement' was reluctantly struck in which further major spending cuts were agreed to, although opposed by a significant minority of Scullin's party. In the heat of this crisis, matters were made worse still by Scullin's decision to travel to London to seek an emergency loan and to attend the Imperial Conference. While in London, Scullin succeeded in gaining loans for Australia at reduced interest. He also succeeded in having King George V appoint Sir Isaac Isaacs as the first Australian-born Governor-General, despite the King's personal opposition and the strong objections of both the British establishment and the conservative opposition in Australia, who attacked the appointment as tantamount to republicanism. However a leadership vacuum was left behind, with Scullin out of the country for the whole second half of 1930, James Fenton (as acting Prime Minister) and Joseph Lyons (as acting Treasurer) were left in charge. They insisted on pursuing deflationary policies and orthodox solutions to degrading Commonwealth budgetary position, arousing great opposition in the Labor caucus. In regular contact with Fenton and Lyons in London through the awkward means of cables, Scullin felt he had no choice but to agree to the recommendations of economic advisers, supported by Lyons and Fenton, that government spending be heavily cut, despite the suffering this caused and the disillusionment of the Labor party's base, whom were most affected by these cuts. Party unity began to crumble, and the gulf between the moderate and radical wings of the party began to grow. =Internal divisions and the Theodore Plan= Scullin in 1931. Returning to Australia in 1931, Scullin was faced with a party now deeply divided over how to respond to the Depression. Jack Lang had won election as Premier of New South Wales and had become a leading alternative voice within Labor, advocating radical measures including repudiation of interest on debts to Britain and printing money to pay for public works programs to relieve unemployment and inflate the currency. The NSW contingent in Federal parliament was sympathetic to Lang's views and had become disillusioned with Scullin's leadership and his compromises with conservative interests. At the first meeting of cabinet upon his return, Scullin made things worse by reappointing Theodore as treasurer, despite his name not having been yet cleared over the Mungana Affair. Although arguably Theodore was the most competent man available to implement Scullin's economic program, Lyons and Fenton (as well as several others) were strongly opposed and resigned from the cabinet in protest. Making matters worse, Theodore had become a fierce personal rival of Lang within the New South Wales branch, and his return as treasurer further isolated radical elements of the party. At the same time, the economy had continued to decline and unemployment had soared, with most of the government measures designed to combat the crisis still in limbo due to opposition either from the Senate or refusal of funding by the Commonwealth Bank. In February Scullin and Theodore presented a comprehensive plan at a conference of the state premiers that attempted to straddle both orthodox and radical approaches. While maintaining heavy budgetary cuts, it also planned to provide economic stimulus to help the unemployed and farmers, as well as repaying short-term debts and overdrafts held by British banks. This would require substantial further funds to be advanced by the Commonwealth Bank, however Gibson soon made it clear he would not do so unless significant cuts to social spending (particularly pensions) was also implemented. Scullin refused, instead planning to pay for the plan through the expanding the note issue. This 'Theodore Plan' was approved by narrow majorities of the state premiers and then the parliamentary party. However, Jack Lang rejected the plan, stating instead that Australia should default on its British debts until more equitable repayment terms were agreed to. Lyons and the conservatives within the party were horrified, as were the Opposition, seeing note issue as a sure path to hyperinflation and complete economic ruin. A cartoon criticising Scullin and Theodore's inflationary financing plans In March matters came to a head. The East Sydney by-election saw Eddie Ward elected on a specifically pro-Lang platform, and the bitter campaign within the seat saw federal Labor and NSW Labor mutually expel each other from the party. Scullin and the Federal party refused to admit Ward to the caucus, and subsequently Jack Beasley led five others out of the party room to sit on the cross-benches as \\"Lang Labor\\". With chaos in Labor ranks and parliament facing a highly controversial plan for economic rehabilitation, the Opposition presented a motion of no confidence. Lyons, Fenton and four others on the conservative wing resigned from Labor and crossed over to the opposition benches. Scullin was reduced to a minority government of just 35 members, depending on the Lang faction to stay in power. Having built a large and popular following among the public, Lyons and his ex-Labor followers joined the Nationalists and the followers of the erstwhile Hughes in United Australia Party, with Lyons becoming the new Leader of the Opposition. With a possible default by the Commonwealth looming in June, Scullin's minority government attempted to push through the Theodore Plan. Although under pressure given the prospect of bankruptcy, the Senate and Gibson did not relent, and nearly all the bills needed to implement the Theodore Plan were rejected. Nationwide opinion was divided on the government plan, however many were extremely concerned about the prospect of excessive inflation should the government start printing money to pay its bills. =Premiers' Plan and downfall= Parliament House portrait of Scullin by William Beckwith McInnes, 1938 Now May, with unemployment at 27.6% widespread suffering across much of the population, Scullin called another conference of the state premiers to try and forge a new deal, now resigned to the fact that compromise with the Opposition was inevitable if any plan could be implemented. A new orthodox plan calling for 20% reductions in spending across the board for all governments was struck, and such cuts to also apply to social welfare spending. Combined with a mass loan conversion that would reduce the interest rates paid on government bonds by 22.5%, Australia now had a consensus as to how to reduce the annual deficit from some ¬£41.08m to ¬£14.65m. Although he had finally secured parliamentary and state approval for a plan, Scullin now faced a revolt from his own party. Cuts to pensions and the poor were particular hard of Scullin, and many core Labor supporters felt deeply betrayed by this compromise of society's most vulnerable groups. Scullin ardently defend the program, but Lang's influence as an alternative opinion leader of Labor was growing, now with state branches in Victoria and South Australia rebelling against the Premiers' Plan. Scullin on the day he handed the reins of power to Joseph Lyons, January 1932. Traumatic as it was, the government finally now was implementing an economic plan, and things began to improve. Domestic confidence, and confidence in the British loan market, began to recover and default was averted. Voluntary acceptance of lower bond rates on government debt had been extremely successful in a patriotic campaign, wool and wheat prices finally began to rise, and government finances at both Commonwealth and state level were largely under control by October. But with unemployment still rising (it would not peak until 1932), Scullin still faced disillusionment from many within his party, and further gains in ground by Lang. Lang felt threatened by the apparent success of the Premier's Plan though, and renewed talks of unity between the factions had appeared with the improvement of economic conditions. Lang Labor subsequently forced a showdown with the Scullin government in November. With allegations arising that Theodore had abused his position as treasurer to buy support in New South Wales away from the Lang faction, Beasley and his followers called for a royal commission into the charges. Scullin refused. To the surprise of many observers, the Beasley group crossed the floor to join the Opposition, thereby defeating the government. A snap poll, the 1931 election, was called. Scullin for the first time in Australian politics made heavy use of the radio to reach voters.Nick Richardson, \\"The 1931 Australian Federal Election‚ÄîRadio Makes History.\\" Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television (2010) 30#3 pp: 377‚Äì389. DOI:10.1080/01439685.2010.505037 The campaign was one of the shortest in history, but with open warfare between pro-Lang and pro-Scullin forces in Victoria and New South Wales, and much of the country still facing hardship and grievances against the government, a Labor defeat was virtually assured. Labor was defeated in a massive landslide. The official Labor Party was reduced to a mere 14 seats (Lang Labor won another 4), and Lyons became Prime Minister. However, Scullin was not held responsible for the debacle and stayed on as Labor leader. To date, it is the last time that a sitting Australian government has been defeated after a single term. Later career Scullin as Opposition leader in 1932. The heavy task of leading the country through the brunt of the depression, beset as he was by many enemies and few friends, left deep marks on Scullin's character. As one Country Party parliamentarian observed, \\"the great burden that was imposed upon him then almost killed him\\". Scullin won much praise for his performance as Opposition Leader, as he had before coming Prime Minister. His grasp of economic and trade matters was still formidable, and on several matters he succeeded in forcing changes to government policy or banding with the Country Party to force amendments to government legislation. However failure to reunite the party and dislodge Lang as the alternative voice of the party failed in the lead-up to the 1934 election left the party at a distinct disadvantage. Ultimately, Scullin and his Commonwealth supporters' implementation of the Premiers' Plan was too much of a betrayal for many to accept, and opposing Lang and Scullin Labor factions continued to plague NSW and Victorian state politics for years. The election proved to be a dispiriting defeat for Scullin. Despite an admirable and vigorous term as opposition leader, Scullin's Labor gained just four seats and actually suffered a small swing against it, with Labor and the UAP losing ground to Lang Labor, which gained 5 seats on a swing of almost 4%. Scullin markedly declined in vigor for his role as Opposition Leader after he was reconfirmed in it after the 1934 election. Tired of the infighting, he took little part in the renewed conciliation talks between the opposition party wings, which in the event failed to resolve the now entrenched divide between Lang and anti-Lang forces. Scullin at many points had stated his resolve to remain leader until such time that he could be sure he would not be succeeded by Lang forces at the federal level, but fate intervened and Scullin's health, always middling, declined significantly in 1935. Bedridden several times, Scullin tendered his resignation on 23 September 1935, citing a physical inability to continue as leader. By the time of Scullin's resignation Australia's economy had recovered significantly and business confidence had returned to a large extent. The belligerent actions of Japan in China, and then Germany in Europe, began to overtake the economy as the predominant concern of Australian politics. Scullin was succeeded by John Curtin, who proved a necessary salve to Labor wounds. Under Curtin's leadership, most of the Lang Labor faction returned to the mainline Labor fold, though Lang and some supporters remained obdurate. During these years Scullin was far quieter in the backbenches, only occasionally taking an active role in parliament, though still an active local member in his seat of Yarra. He was a passionate advocate for Australian arts, and with the Fellowship of Australian Writers, was responsible for a dramatic boost to the Commonwealth Literary Fund's budget in 1939.**Wilde, William H.; Hooton, Joy; and Andrews, Barry The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature Oxford University Press, Melbourne 2nd ed. Scullin during the 1940s Curtin became Prime Minister in 1941 after two independents joined Labor in voting down the government's budget. Curtin came to rely on Scullin greatly for his counsel. Scullin took no portfolio nor played any part in military strategy or much of the overall war effort, except where finance was concerned. However, he was given the office between Curtin and Treasurer Ben Chifley's, and his advice would have significant bearing upon the policy and political tactics of the Curtin government. Scullin was a leading voice in caucus in support of the new PM, urging it to give Curtin the powers to run his own government without the caucus interference Scullin himself had so frequently fallen afoul of a decade earlier. To Scullin's delight, rafts of social and economic policies, so long out of reach for Labor governments, finally became law during the wartime government. Scullin continued to be a leading voice in the movement in favour of further social welfare plans and was influential within the party in the nature and direction these took. Another of Scullin's long held ambitions ‚Äì eradication of the Federal structure in favour of a unified state ‚Äì was advanced when he was appointed as one of three on a committee to recommend means of implementing uniform taxation. That committee soon proposed eliminating state governments' ability to levy income tax, a proposal which Curtin accepted and greatly weakened the Federal system by making states fiscally dependent on the Commonwealth. Scullin's committee work shone out again in 1944, where he led the charge to change the tax code to operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, which was accepted and implemented by the Curtin Government. Ill-health continued to return in bouts, but Scullin remained active if subdued in parliament after Curtin's death and Chifley's succession in 1945. He continued to be influential in fiscal and taxation matters, and the impact of his experience was still occasionally felt in Chifley-era legislation. However his health declined significantly in 1947, and he did not appear in parliament again after June of that year, announcing he would retire at the 1949 election. =Death and funeral= Grave of James and Sarah Scullin at Melbourne General Cemetery. Scullin was frequently bedridden in these last 18 months, and unable to attend many gatherings. His condition deteriorated further after retirement, suffering cardio-renal failure in 1951 and becoming almost permanently bedridden and under the care of his wife. Scullin died in his sleep on 28 January 1953 in Hawthorn, Melbourne from complications arising from pulmonary edema. He was accorded a state funeral in St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne with a Requiem Mass presided over by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. He was buried in the Catholic section of Melbourne General Cemetery. Over his grave the federal Labor executive and the ACTU erected a monument on behalf of the Labor movement of Australia. The inscription reads: \\"Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong.\\" Scullin's wife, Sarah, was interred with him in 1962. Labor stalwats Arthur Calwell, Esmond Kiernan, Herbert Cremean and Edward Grayndler are all buried adjactent to the Scullin plot. Legacy Bust of James Scullin located in the Ballarat Botanical Gardens Scullin had defended his record in government throughout his later career, and took pride in having been Prime Minister in times which might have broken a lesser figure. However he lived long enough to see many of his economic ideas vindicated by history, particularly inflationary financing, which was quite radical by the standards of his times but an accepted pillar of Keynesian economics adopted by Australia and most other Western governments in the late 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, John Maynard Keynes himself would state of Scullin's Premier's Plan which caused him so much woe and electoral unpopularity that it \\"saved the economic structure of Australia\\". The Economist admitted after the 1931 election that Scullin \\"had already done much to place Australia on the high road to recovery\\". Several measures which had been proposed and defeated by the UAP opposition (particularly on gold shipments for loan repayments) were subsequently reintroduced and passed by the UAP once in government, giving Scullin some satisfaction. Furthermore, Scullin consoled himself with the fact that the Depression destroyed most of the political careers of those who occupied government through it ‚Äì only one Australian premier won re-election from 1927 to 1935, and Scullin's foreign contemporaries Herbert Hoover (in the United States of America), Ramsay MacDonald (United Kingdom), Richard Bennett (Canada) and George Forbes (New Zealand) all suffered similarly devastating elections in the wake of the depression. In 1951, 114 manufacturers in Melbourne donated to a fund for Scullin's retirement. Having not forgotten his advocacy of tariffs during their height of unpopularity in the depression, several companies went as far to state that Scullin's efforts had \\"commenced a new era in the secondary industry field in Australia\\" and that the success of Australia's wartime industry was due to Scullin's protection of industry during its most vulnerable period a decade earlier. Scullin's years following his term of government also proved fruitful ‚Äì he exerted a surprising amount of influence over government policy as Opposition Leader. Scullin was for decades the foremost expert in the Australian parliament on taxation and a variety of other fiscal matters, a fact which rendered his advice very influential within the Curtin government and many of his ideas, having been denied during his own term of government, would eventually be enshrined in the wave of sweeping reforms made by the Curtin/Chifley governments. Scullin was a well-respected figure in politics. Although the target of much bile and disagreement over his policies, he was personally extremely well regarded and had a reputation as a fearless and stoic leader of great personal integrity and fortitude. His resignation as leader in 1935 caused even longtime critic Jack Beasley to admit that Scullin was \\"a fearless fighter in the exposition of what he believes to be the right course\\". Scullin, Australian Capital Territory, a suburb of Canberra, is named after him, as is the Division of Scullin, a House of Representatives electorate. The Scullin monolith in Antarctica was also named in his honour. See also * Scullin Ministry References Bibliography Books  Byrne, Liam.

While fighting alongside government forces against the Hauhau in 1865, he was accused of spying. Exiled to the Chatham Islands without trial along with captured Hauhau, he experienced visions and became a religious leader. In 1868 he led the escape of 168 prisoners, seizing the schooner Rifleman and sailing back to the North Island where he began a series of raids. A resultant military reprisal campaign became known as Te Kooti's War. He was pardoned in 1883 but continued to be active in spreading the Ringat≈´ message of peace and reclaiming land from Pakeha. Early life Te Kooti's early years are obscure. He was born at Te Pa-o-Kahu in the Gisborne region as a son of Hone Rangipatahi (father) and Hine Turakau (mother), of the Rongowhakaata subtribe (iwi). Their hap≈´ was Ngati Maru, whose villages were situated near the Awapuni lagoon, where the Waipaoa River runs into the ocean.Binney, Redemption Songs, p 16; Beaufoy, 2006, p 9 Arikirangi is thought to be the original name of Te Kooti. His birth date is thought to be approximately 1832.Binney, Redemption Songs, p 16 A matakite (visionary) of Nukutaurua on Mahia Peninsula, named Toiroa Ikariki (Ikarihi), prophesied the birth of Te Kooti (as well as the coming of the white men, the PƒÅkehƒÅ): The song is dated 1766. The PakerewhƒÅ were strangers with red or white skin and Arikirangi was a grandchild of Toiroa, still to be born.Binney, Redemption Songs, p 11 Te Kooti is understood to be his Christian baptismal name. Te Kooti was apparently a very troublesome boy to his father, who tried to kill him. In 1852 he became notorious as one of a group of young Maori causing trouble in the Gisborne district. He took on the role of a \\"social bandit\\", breaking into settlers' homes and stealing goods as part of a plunder party.Binney, Redemption Songs, p 21 He was sent to the Mission School at Whakato, near Manutuke. In 1846‚Äì1847 he was taught by Samuel Williams. Samuel and his uncle, William Williams \\"helped the boy to find a new world in the Bible\\".Mitcalfe, 1963, p 46 But his reputation was still suffering, also after contacts with the Reverend Thomas Samuel Grace, who was to replace William Williams for a few years (1850‚Äì1853). Local chiefs were asked by settlers to work with the local runanga (Maori council) to solve problems with Te Kooti but Te Kooti's men persisted in taking pigs, horses, cattle and alcohol, angering the runanga run by senior chiefs. As a result, Te Kooti's Pa was attacked by Te Aitanga-a-Matiaki. Many prisoners were taken but Te Kooti escaped.Binney, Redemption Songs, p 22 He had to leave home and went to sea on different ships that traded along the coasts of the North Island. Exile In 1865 while fighting with government forces to suppress the Pai Marire (or Hauhau cult), he was arrested as a spy while trying to contact his brother who was fighting with the Hauhau, and exiled to the Chatham Islands, together with the rebels he had been fighting against. He was never tried and took every opportunity to demand a trial. Some say he got his name from this, \\"Kooti\\" pronounced \\"Courty\\", others that it was a MƒÅori version of the last name \\"Coates\\". If he did supply the Pai Marire with guns as is alleged, he also took part in a battle against them. There are allegations he fired blanks on this occasion. While on the Chatham Islands Te Kooti experienced visions and became a religious leader. Te Kooti was referred to by other prisoners as Tawhaki, the twice born, after his unexpected survival from tuberculosis.Binney, Stories Without End, p 188 He also performed some sleight of hand, such as using matchheads to set his hand on fire above the altar during a church service. These tricks swayed the MƒÅori prisoners on Chatham Islands, and when some of the chiefs present on the island were sent back to the mainland, Te Kooti took advantage of the situation to become the local leader. Only Te Kooti's uncle was not impressed by these tricks, which he saw right through. Nevertheless, Te Kooti established a faith named Ringat≈´ (\\"upraised hand\\") which gained many followers, and is still present in New Zealand society today. During this time on the Chatham Islands, Te Kooti (or Te Koti as he signed in the documents) was married in a civil marriage to Maata Te Owai on 27 July 1867. The marriage documents reveal that he was born in 1832.King, Being Pakeha Now, p 202 Escape In 1868, expecting a resupply boat, Te Kooti prophesied that two boats would soon arrive to take them off the island. Normally the prisoners worked on a farm but using the excuse of rain a number of convicts were able to enter the redoubt. There were actually only 6 guards on the whole Island as the majority had been removed in April to Hokitika where a Fenian uprising was feared. On 4 July 1868, Te Kooti led an escape, and with 168 other prisoners seized the schooner Rifleman, with supplies and rifles, scuttled another vessel the Florence so that the alarm could not be raised and set off back to the North Island. One Chatham Island sergeant was killed because of a personal grievance.King, Moriori The PƒÅkehƒÅ sailors were allowed to live and set sail for the coast of New Zealand with help from the MƒÅori hijackers. The sailors attempted to sail towards Wellington, but with Te Kooti's expertise at sailing were caught and told they would be thrown overboard if they did not keep a course for the East Coast. On the fourth day at sea, the ship was becalmed and Te Kooti declared that a sacrifice was needed. Te Kooti had his uncle,Te Warihi Otini,Binney, Redemption Songs, p 20 thrown overboard and soon afterwards the ship made headway again. Upon their arrival at Whareongaonga in Poverty Bay, Te Kooti asked the MƒÅori King Movement and the Tuhoe tribes for refuge but was rejected. He also sought dialogue with the colonial government but was rebuffed. He sent a statement to the effect that if the government wanted a war, he would give it to them in November. At war On 10 November 1868, Te Kooti and his followers attacked the township of Matawhero on the outskirts of Gisborne. Some 54 people were slaughtered, including women and children. The dead included 22 local MƒÅori as well as European settlers. This was probably a revenge attack, motivated by Te Kooti's imprisonment as a spy. Te Kooti was then pursued by colonial and sympathetic MƒÅori forces. His community was surrounded at Ngatapa, but Te Kooti and his warriors managed to escape. From there, Te Kooti was chased to Te Porere. There, he set up a pa and withstood an attack from the British forces, including some opposing Maori troops, under Major Kepa. After much fighting, the British broke through into the pa and Te Kooti had to abandon it, leaving many dead and wounded. Te Kooti himself was shot in the finger on his escape. From there, Te Kooti escaped into the Urewera and made an alliance with the Tuhoe leadership. From 1869 to 1872, Te Kooti and his followers raided throughout the central North Island while being pursued by their colonial and MƒÅori enemies. His power was only broken once his Tuhoe allies were systematically conquered by his enemies. But once again Te Kooti managed to escape, this time to the King Country where he spent the next decade under the protection of the MƒÅori King. Te Kooti used this time to develop his religion. Pardon and later life In 1878 Te Kooti was thrown out of a hui at Hikurangi, which had been called by the government, because he had broken the ban on alcohol that was enforced by King TƒÅwhiao. Te Kooti stormed out of the meeting and went into a wild rage. In the morning he returned covered in albatross feathers, shuffling and bent over, having taken on the persona of a shuffling old man. Te Kooti is portrayed in this narrative as Tawhaki, the twice born. He threw off his disguise and lightning flashed from his arm pits. The feathers were to show divinely inspired peace, according to the story.Binney, Stories Without End, p 189 In 1883, Te Kooti was pardoned by the government and began to travel New Zealand. His followers grew and he decided to return to his old home. However, his past violence had not been forgotten and the local magistrate arrested him and imprisoned him, citing an anticipatory breach of the peace. Te Kooti was released on the condition that he never again try to return to his old home. Te Kooti appealed this decision, and was initially successful, but in 1890 the Court of Appeal ruled that the terror and alarm that Te Kooti's reappearance would have entailed justified the magistrate's decision.

She is best known for her performances in The Docks of New York and The Barker, the latter of which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Early life Compson was born on March 19, 1897, the daughter of Virgil Compson and Mary Rauscher, in Beaver, Utah, at a mining camp. Her father was a mining engineer, a gold prospector, and a grocery store proprietor, and her mother was a maid in homes and in a hotel. Compson graduated from Salt Lake High School. Her father died when she was young, and she obtained employment as a violinist at 16 at a theater in Salt Lake City. Career Playing in vaudeville sketches with touring circuits, Compson got noticed by Hollywood producers. While touring, she was discovered by comedic producer Al Christie and signed a contract with him. Her first silent film, Wanted, a Leading Lady, was in November 1915. She made 25 films in 1916 alone, although all of them were shorts for Christie with the exception of one feature, Almost a Widow.Muller, Eddie. 2012. San Francisco Silent Film Festival: The Docks of New York Retrieved 28 April 2018. http://www.silentfilm.org/archive/the-docks-of-new-york She continued this pace of making numerous short films well into the middle of 1918, when after a long apprenticeship with Christie she started making features exclusively. Compson's star began to rise with the release of the 1919 feature The Miracle Man (1919) for George Loane Tucker. Paramount signed Compson to a five-year contract with the help of Tucker. Compson in Photoplay (July 1920) Her popularity allowed her to establish her own production company that providing her creative control over screenplays and financing. Her first movie as producer was Prisoners of Love (1921). She played the role of Blanche Davis, a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected Art Rosson to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by actress and writer Catherine Henry. After completing The Woman With Four Faces (1923), Paramount refused to offer her a raise (her salary was $2,500 per week) and she refused to sign without one. Instead, she signed with a motion picture company in London. There she starred in a series of four films directed by Graham Cutts, a well-known English filmmaker. The first of these was a movie version of an English play called Woman to Woman (1923), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock. Part of The White Shadow (in which she played a dual role), another Cutts/Hitchcock collaboration. Woman to Woman proved to be popular enough for Jesse Lasky to offer top dollar to return to Paramount. Back in Hollywood, she starred in The Enemy Sex, directed by James Cruze. The two were married in 1925; they divorced in 1929. Her contract with Paramount was not renewed, and she decided to freelance, working with lower-budget studios such as Columbia in The Belle of Broadway and Chadwick in The Ladybird. During this time, she was suggested as a replacement for difficult Greta Garbo in the MGM feature Flesh and the Devil opposite John Gilbert. She eventually worked for the studio with former The Miracle Man co-star Lon Chaney in The Big City In 1928, she appeared in a First National Pictures part-talkie, The Barker. Her performance as manipulative carnival girl Carrie garnered her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, although she lost to Mary Pickford in Coquette. In Court-Martial, a 1928 silent film that apparently has not survived, she became the first actress to portray Old West outlaw Belle Starr on film. In the same year, she appeared in the acclaimed Josef von Sternberg film The Docks of New York in a sympathetic portrayal of a suicidal prostitute. These films caused Compson's popularity to re-emerge, and she became a busy actress in the new talking cinema. In fact, Chaney offered her the female lead in his first talkie The Unholy Three, but she was too busy and instead suggested friend Lila Lee. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice recorded exceptionally well. Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals, in which her singing voice was dubbed. =Later career= Betty Compson on the cover of the 1922 March Motion Picture Classic magazine. Cover artist, Benjamin Eggleston (1867-1937). Now divorced from Cruze, Compson's career continued to flourish, starring in nine films in 1930 alone. However, her last hit proved to be in The Spoilers, alongside Gary Cooper. She was unable to score a success and only secured roles in \\"poverty row\\" studios. One major film in which she did not appear was Gone with the Wind; although she shot a Technicolor screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role. In 1941, Compson appeared in a small role in an Alfred Hitchcock film. Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Most of her later films were low-budget efforts. Compson's last film was 1948's Here Comes Trouble; after retiring from the screen, she began a cosmetic line and helped her husband run a business called Ashtrays Unlimited. Personal life After her marriage with Cruze ended, Compson married two more times. Her marriage to agent/producer Irving Weinberg ended in divorce, and her marriage to Silvius Gall ended with Gall's death in 1962. She had no children. Death Compson died April 18, 1974, of a heart attack at her home in Glendale, California, aged 77. She was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in San Fernando, California.

The screenplay by Howard E. Koch is based on the 1927 play of the same name by W. Somerset Maugham derived from his own short story. The play was first filmed in 1929, by director Jean de Limur. The story was inspired by a real-life scandal involving the wife of the headmaster of a school in Kuala Lumpur who was convicted in a murder trial after shooting dead a male friend in April 1911. She was eventually pardoned. Plot On a moonlit, tropical night, the native workers are asleep in their outdoor barracks. A shot is heard; the door of a house opens and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; the man whom she shot is recognized by her manservant as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \\"tried to make love to me\\" and that she killed him to save her honor. Bette Davis as Leslie Crosbie Leslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically. Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening, and pleading with him to come‚Äîimplicitly threatening him if he did not come. Ong Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town. The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price. Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defence. Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so he will risk his own freedom and career. Because the couple's bank account is in Robert's name, Howard obtains Robert's consent to buy the letter, but he does so deceitfully, lying about and trivializing its content, leaving out the true circumstances, and giving the man no idea that the price is equivalent to almost all the money he has in the bank. Robert, depicted as a decent man thoroughly in love with Leslie and somewhat gullible, is readily persuaded. Hammond's widow demands that Leslie come personally to hand over the $10,000 for the letter (she has been released into her attorney's custody) and requires Leslie to abase herself by picking up the letter at the widow's feet. With the letter suppressed, Leslie is easily acquitted. During a celebration after the trial Robert announces that he plans to draw his savings out of his account in order to buy a rubber plantation in Sumatra. Howard and Leslie are forced to tell him that his savings are gone, that the impact of the letter would have hanged Leslie and its price was accordingly high. After demanding to see the letter, Robert is devastated to learn from Leslie that Hammond was her lover for years and that she killed him out of jealousy. At a party celebrating Leslie's acquittal, Robert tells friends of his plans to buy the plantation. Leslie, overhearing him, leaves the party, and Robert breaks down. Leslie goes to her room, tries to take up her lacemaking but cannot. She sobs. Stepping onto the balcony, she sees a knife laid on the matting. She withdraws, shocked. Robert comes into the room and offers to forgive her if she can swear that she loves him. Leslie at first agrees and tells him she loves him, and that she will do all in her power to make him happy. When he kisses her, she cries \\"No!\\" and then breaks down and confesses, \\"With all my heart, I still love the man I killed!\\" Robert rushes from the room. Leslie looks out at the patio mat, and the knife is gone. She knows that Hammond's widow had planted it there, and then has taken it away. She knows the woman waits for her‚Äîto kill her, and she realizes this is her fate. She walks out through the gardens and, finally, encounters the woman who glares at her fiercely. The man who accompanies her grabs Leslie and stuffs a cloth in her mouth to silence her, and then the woman pulls the knife from her garments and stabs Leslie, who falls to the ground. As the two murderers attempt to slip away silently, they are confronted by a policeman. The clouds blot out the moonlight and darken the area where Leslie was killed; then the clouds open and the moon's rays shine where her body lies, but no one is there to see it.

The character of Mrs. Hammond was changed from Hammond's Chinese mistress to his Eurasian wife to placate the Hays Office.Notes section in The Letter at Turner Classic Movies. Director William Wyler and star Bette Davis, who had previously worked together on Jezebel, disagreed about the climactic scene in which Leslie admits to her husband she still loves the man she murdered. Davis felt no woman could look at her husband when she admits such a thing. Wyler disagreed, and Davis walked off the set. She later returned and did it Wyler's way, but ever after, Davis insisted her approach would have been better.The Letter at Turner Classic Movies. Wyler also argued with Warner Bros. head Jack L. Warner over the casting of British actor James Stephenson as attorney Howard Joyce. Warner originally had suggested Stephenson for the role, but after Wyler cast him, the studio head had second thoughts and thought the role was too important to cast an unknown in it. Wyler stood firm, and Stephenson's performance earned him an Oscar nomination. Herbert Marshall also appeared in the 1929 version, in which he played the lover who was killed by Leslie. Reception =Critical response= In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther observed, \\"The ultimate credit for as taut and insinuating a melodrama as has come along this year ‚Äî a film which extenuates tension like a grim inquisitor's rack‚Äîmust be given to Mr. Wyler. His hand is patent throughout . . . Miss Davis is a strangely cool and calculating killer who conducts herself with reserve and yet implies a deep confusion of emotions . . . Only the end of The Letter is weak ‚Äî and that is because of the postscript which the Hays Office has compelled\\".The New York Times, film review. November 23, 1940. Accessed: July 13, 2013. Variety magazine wrote, \\"Never has [the W. Somerset Maugham play] been done with greater production values, a better all-around cast or finer direction. Its defect is its grimness. Director William Wyler, however, sets himself a tempo which is in rhythm with the Malay locale . . . Davis' frigidity at times seems to go even beyond the characterization. On the other hand, Marshall never falters. Virtually stealing these honors in the pic, however, is Stephenson as the attorney, while Sondergaard is the perfect mask-like threat\\".Variety film review, 1940. Accessed: July 14, 2013. Time Out London says, \\"A superbly crafted melodrama, even if it never manages to top the moody montage with which it opens - moon scudding [sic] behind clouds, rubber dripping from a tree, coolies dozing in the compound, a startled cockatoo - as a shot rings out, a man staggers out onto the verandah, and Davis follows to empty her gun grimly into his body . . . [The] camerawork, almost worthy of Sternberg in its evocation of sultry Singapore nights and cool gin slings, is not matched by natural sounds (on the soundtrack Max Steiner's score does a lot of busy underlining).\\"Time Out London film review, Time Out Film Guide 2009, 2008, Time Out Group/Random House, p606.

Carr is generally regarded as one of the greatest writers of so-called \\"Golden Age\\" mysteries; complex, plot- driven stories in which the puzzle is paramount. He was influenced in this regard by the works of Gaston Leroux and by the Father Brown stories of G. K. Chesterton. He was a master of the so-called locked room mystery, in which a detective solves apparently impossible crimes. The Dr. Fell mystery The Hollow Man (1935), usually considered Carr's masterpiece, was selected in 1981 as the best locked-room mystery of all time by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers. He also wrote a number of historical mysteries. A resident of England for a number of years, Carr is often grouped among \\"British-style\\" mystery writers. Most (though not all) of his novels had English settings, especially country villages and estates, and English characters. His two best- known fictional detective characters (Dr. Gideon Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale) were both English. The son of Wooda Nicholas Carr, a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania, Carr graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown in 1925 and Haverford College in 1929. During the early 1930s, he relocated to England, where he married Clarice Cleaves, an Englishwoman. He began his mystery- writing career there, returning to the United States as an internationally known author during 1948. In 1950, his biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle earned Carr the first of his two Special Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America; the second was awarded in 1970, in recognition of his 40-year career as a mystery writer. He was also presented the MWA's Grand Master award in 1963. Carr was one of only two Americans ever admitted to the British Detection Club. In early spring 1963, while living in Mamaroneck, New York, Carr suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side. He continued to write using one hand, and for several years contributed a regular column of mystery and detective book reviews, \\"The Jury Box\\", to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Carr eventually relocated to Greenville, South Carolina, and died there of lung cancer on February 28, 1977. Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale Carr's two major detective characters, Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, are superficially quite similar. Both are large, upper-class, eccentric Englishmen somewhere between middle-aged and elderly. Dr. Fell, who is fat and walks only with the aid of two canes, was clearly modeled on the British writer G. K. Chesterton and is at all times civil and genial. He has a great mass of untidy hair that is often covered by a \\"shovel hat\\" and he generally wears a cape. He lives in a modest cottage and does not have any official association with public authorities. Henry Merrivale or \\"H.M.\\", on the other hand, although stout and with a majestic \\"corporation\\", is active physically and is feared for his ill-temper and noisy rages. In a 1949 novel, A Graveyard To Let, for example, he demonstrates an unexpected talent for hitting baseballs improbable distances. A wealthy descendant of the \\"oldest baronetcy\\" in England, he is part of the Establishment (even though he frequently rails against it) and in the earlier novels is the director of the British Secret Service. In The Plague Court Murders he is said to be qualified as both a barrister and a medical doctor. Even in the earliest books the bald, bespectacled, and scowling H.M. is clearly a Churchillian figure and in the later novels this similarity is somewhat more consciously evoked. Many of the Merrivale novels, written using the Carter Dickson byline, rank with Carr's best work, including the much-praised The Judas Window (1938). Many of the Fell novels feature two or more different impossible crimes, including He Who Whispers (1946) and The Case of the Constant Suicides (1941). The novel The Crooked Hinge (1938) combines a seemingly impossible throat-slashing, witchcraft, a survivor of the ship Titanic, an eerie automaton modeled on Wolfgang von Kempelen's chess player, and a case similar to that of the Tichborne Claimant into what is often cited as one of the greatest classics of detective fiction. But even Carr's biographer, Douglas G. Greene, notes that the explanation, like many of Carr's in other books, seriously stretches plausibility and the reader's credulity. Dr. Fell's own discourse on locked room mysteries in chapter 17 of The Hollow Man is acclaimed critically and is sometimes printed as a stand-alone essay in its own right. Other works Besides Dr. Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale, Carr mysteries feature two other series detectives: Henri Bencolin and Colonel March. A few of his novels do not feature a series detective. The most famous of these, The Burning Court (1937), involves witchcraft, poisoning, and a body that disappears from a sealed crypt in suburban Philadelphia; it was the basis for the French movie La chambre ardente (1962). Carr wrote in the short story format as well. Julian Symons, in Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History (1972), said: \\"Most of Carr's stories are compressed versions of his locked-room novels, and at times they benefit from the compression. Probably the best of them are in the Carter Dickson book, The Department of Queer Complaints (1940), although this does not include the brilliantly clever H.M. story The House in Goblin Wood or a successful pastiche which introduces Edgar Allan Poe as a detective.\\"Julian Symons, Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History, first published Faber and Faber 1972, with revisions Penguin 1974, During 1950, Carr wrote the novel, The Bride of Newgate, set during 1815 at the close of the Napoleonic Wars, \\"one of the earliest historical mystery novels.\\" The Devil in Velvet and Fire, Burn! are the two historical novels (involving also Time travel) with which he said he himself was most pleased. With Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Arthur Conan Doyle, Carr wrote Sherlock Holmes stories that were published in the 1954 collection The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes. He was also honored by the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle by being asked to write the biography for the legendary author. The book, The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was published during 1949 and received generally favorable reviews for its vigor and entertaining style. Critical appraisal Dr. Fell has generally been considered to be Carr's major creation. The British novelist Kingsley Amis, for instance, writes in his essay, \\"My Favorite Sleuths\\", that Dr. Fell is one of the three great successors to Sherlock Holmes (the other two are Father Brown and Nero Wolfe) and that H.M., \\"according to me is an old bore.\\" This may be in part because in the Merrivale novels written after World War II, H.M. frequently became a comic caricature of himself, especially in the physical misadventures in which he found himself at least once in every novel. Humorous as these episodes were intended to be, they also tended to have the effect of decreasing the mystique of the character. Earlier, however, H.M. had been regarded more favorably by a number of critics. Howard Haycraft, author of the seminal Murder for Pleasure: The Life and Times of the Detective Story, wrote during 1941 that H.M. or \\"The Old Man\\" was \\"the present writer's admitted favorite among contemporary fictional sleuths\\". During 1938 the British mystery writer R. Philmore wrote in an article called \\"Inquest on Detective Stories\\" that Sir Henry was \\"the most amusing of detectives\\". And further: \\"Of course, H.M. is so much the best detective that, once having invented him, his creator could get away with any plot.\\" There is a book- length critical study by S. T. Joshi, John Dickson Carr: A Critical Study (1990) () and a chapter on Carr in Joshi's book Varieties of Crime Fiction (2019) . The definitive biography of Carr is by Douglas G. Greene, John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles (1995) (). From an obituary published in Greenville, South Carolina, Carr allegedly also published using the name of Fenton Carter, but no works by anyone of this name have yet been identified. Radio plays Carr also wrote many radio scripts, particularly for the Suspense radio anthology series in America and for its UK equivalent Appointment With Fear introduced by Valentine Dyall, as well as many other dramas for the BBC, and some screenplays. His 1943 half-hour radio play Cabin B-13 was expanded into a series on CBS during 1948-49 for which Carr wrote all 25 scripts, basing some on earlier works or re-presenting devices that Chesterton had used. The 1943 play Cabin B-13 was also expanded into the script for the 1953 movie Dangerous Crossing, directed by Joseph M. Newman and featuring Michael Rennie and Jeanne Crain. Carr worked extensively for BBC Radio during World War II, writing both mystery stories and propaganda scripts. During the late 1940s he hosted Murder by Experts transmitted by Mutual radio. He introduced works by other mystery writers who were the week's guest writers. The show originated from Mutual's main station WOR in New York City. Many of these shows are available for free listening or downloading at the Internet Archive. Film and television Carr's works were the basis for several movies, including The Man With a Cloak (1951) and Dangerous Crossing (1953). The Emperor's Snuffbox was filmed as That Woman Opposite (1957), and La chambre ardente (1962) was a loose adaptation of The Burning Court. Various Carr stories formed the basis for episodes of television series, particularly those without recurring characters such as General Motors Presents. During 1956, the television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard, featuring Boris Karloff as Colonel March, was based on Carr's character and his stories and was broadcast for 26 episodes.

Fifth edition, 1930-1980. Edited by John Jones and Sally Viney (1983), p. 294.) is an English author of (primarily) Victorian-era historical, crime and detective fiction, as well as books on factual crime and criminals, in particular several academic books on the history of crime in London. He has written a number of biographies, two volumes of poetry, and has also edited volumes of poetry by John Dryden and the Pre-Raphaelites. Biography Donald Thomas was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset on 18 July 1934. He was educated at Queen's College, Taunton, before completing his National Service in the Royal Air Force (1953-1955) and then going up to Balliol College, Oxford (1955-1958).The Balliol College Register. Fifth edition, 1930-1980. Edited by John Jones and Sally Viney (1983), p. 294. He currently holds a personal chair as Professor Emeritus of English Literature at Cardiff University.Donald Thomas at A.M. Heath . Accessed 9 February 2008Academic Staff, Cardiff School of English, Communication, and Philosophy. Accessed 9 February 2008 =Early works= Thomas's earliest works seem to have been in the area of legal and historical fact, notably revised texts of Thomas Bayly Howell's collection of state trials, originally collected at the behest of William Cobbett and published between 1809 and 1826.WorldCat on State Trials. Accessed 10 February 2008 Among his earliest forays into the world of fiction was Sergeant Verity and the Cracksman, 1974, published under the pseudonym Francis Selwyn. By the early 1980s, however, he had largely shed the Selwyn pseudonym (returning to it briefly in the late 1980s for some non-fiction works, and once in 2000, for another \\"Verity\\" novel), and began writing under his own name, Donald (S.) Thomas, switching from academic study and biography to Sherlockiana and crime fiction, all underpinned with his deep knowledge of the times and cultures of which he writes. =Biographies & fact= He has written a number of books, mostly novels, on a variety of subjects predominantly set in Victorian England. He has also written a small number of non-fiction works dealing with similar subjects/settings, among them a study of the Victorian underworld, and biographies of Robert Browning, the Marquis de Sade, Henry Fielding, and Lewis Carroll. His 1978 (rev. ed. 2001) biography of Admiral Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald highlights the characteristics of that individual which served in large part as inspiration both for C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower, and for Patrick O'Brian's Jack Aubrey. In 1994, his Hanged in Error? provided an overview/investigation as to the likely guilt of seven individuals all hanged in the UK before its abolition as a means of capital punishment in 1965. The book dealt with the cases of Timothy Evans, John Williams (alias George MacKay, hanged in 1913 for the fatal shooting of Inspector Arthur Walls in Eastbourne during a burglary attempt), Edith Thompson, Robert Hoolhouse, Neville Heath, Charles Jenkins (hanged in 1947 together with Christopher Geraghty for fatally shooting Alec de Antiquis following a botched London jewel robbery), and James Hanratty. (N.B. This is not the same as the similarly titled 1961 book Hanged in Error by Leslie Hale, which contains a different set of case histories.) In academic circles, he is especially well known for his studies of the criminal underworld of London from Victorian times, through World War II to the Kray twins. He has written seven biographies and a handful of other biographical studies, as well as fictionalised biographies of individuals such as Bonnie Prince Charlie. His biography of Lewis Carroll is recommended by Representative Poetry Online, and his other biographical works can be found on many academic reading lists.Lewis Carroll at Representative Poetry Online . Accessed 9 February 2008 He has edited volumes of Everyman's Library on poets ranging from John Dryden to the Post-Romantics, and also offered a translation of Michel Millot and Jean L'Ange's bawdy 17th century novel L'√âcole des filles, which is described as \\"both an uninhibited manual of sexual technique and an erotic masterpiece of the first order\\" on its back cover. =Fiction= In fiction terms, he is perhaps best known for his more recent works, in particular a series of Sherlock Holmes pastiches, beginning with 1997's The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes. He has also written a number of other titles, and three series featuring the main characters of: :Alfred Swain, an inspector of Scotland Yard. :Sonny Tarrant, a \\"gangland capo\\",Donald Thomas Bibliography.

He has also written a series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries set in the United States and Minnesota in the 1890s. The books feature the character Shadwell Rafferty, who assists Holmes in his American investigations. Education Millett attended St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1969. He went on to Chicago, Illinois, where he obtained an English Masters degree in 1970 from the University of Chicago. Career Millett worked at the Pioneer Press from 1972 until 1984 when he had an opportunity to study architecture at the University of Michigan. When he returned to St. Paul in 1985, he became the newspaper's first architecture critic. He has written articles for several historical and architectural magazines in the Midwest, mostly focusing on works by Prairie School architects such as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Millett's Lost Twin Cities is probably the best known of his works in the Minneapolis- St. Paul region largely because KTCA, a local public television station, created a video documentary by the same name which covered a few of the buildings in the book.

It was the first full-sound feature shot at Astoria Studios, Queens, New York City.The Letter at silentera.com A silent version of the film also was released.Advertisement, Photoplay, March 1929, p.4 It stars the noted stage actress Jeanne Eagels and O.P. Heggie, and it was directed by Jean de Limur. The film was adapted by Garrett Fort from the 1927 play The Letter by W. Somerset Maugham. It tells the story of a married woman who kills her lover out of jealousy and is brought to trial. Plot Bored and lonely living on her husband's rubber plantation, Leslie Crosbie takes a lover, Geoffrey Hammond, but he eventually tires of her and takes a Chinese mistress, Li-Ti. When Leslie finds out, she insists on seeing him while her husband is away and tries to rekindle his love. However, Geoffrey isn't moved and tells her that he prefers Li-Ti. Leslie becomes enraged and shoots him repeatedly. At the murder trial, Leslie perjures herself on the stand, claiming she had little to do with Hammond and that she shot him when he tried to rape her. Meanwhile, Li-Ti's emissary provides Joyce, Leslie's attorney, with a copy of the letter in which Leslie begged Hammond to come see her. Li-Ti is ready to sell it for $10,000, provided Leslie herself makes the exchange. On Joyce's advice, Leslie agrees. Li-Ti humiliates her, but eventually accepts the money. Leslie is found not guilty. Joyce presents his bill to Leslie's husband, Robert. Robert demands an explanation as to why the expenses total $10,000. Joyce relates the story of Li-Ti's blackmail and gives Robert the damning letter. Robert confronts Leslie and forces her to admit everything. Leslie proclaims that she still loves the man she killed. As punishment, Robert decides to keep her on the plantation, even though he no longer has any money. Cast *Jeanne Eagels as Leslie Crosbie *Reginald Owen as Robert Crosbie *Herbert Marshall as Geoffrey Hammond *Irene Browne as Mrs. Joyce *O.P. Heggie as Mr. Joyce *Lady Tsen Mei as Li-Ti *Tamaki Yoshiwara as Ong Chi Seng Preservation status The Letter was long out of circulation. In June 2011, a restored edition of the film was released on home video by Warner Bros. (via Turner Entertainment) as part of its Warner Archive Collection as a made-on-demand DVD. Awards and nominations Eagels, who died just months after the film was completed, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the married woman. She was the first performer to be so recognized by the Academy after her death, though hers was not an official nomination. Eagels was among several actresses \\"under consideration\\" by a board of judges. The Letter was cited as one of the Top Ten Films of 1929 by the National Board of Review. Remake Herbert Marshall, who plays Leslie's lover in the film also appears as her husband in William Wyler's 1940 Warner Bros. remake. Bette Davis received an Oscar nomination for the role of Leslie Crosbie in the remake, just as Jeanne Eagels had done in 1929.

Biography Bent was born in Eastport, Maine USA. He ran away to sea at 17 and spent three years travelling the Atlantic seaboard as a sailor/ gunner in the US Navy. He returned to Eastport but was restless and sailed to Liverpool, England. Penniless and seeking adventure on 18 October 1859 he enlisted in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot in the British Army. He served in India and his unit was posted to New Zealand in 1861. His record was dubious, and he was repeatedly disciplined for various military infractions including disobedience and drunkenness. This discipline included a prison sentence in Wellington, and receiving lashes in front of his company. Bent accordingly decided to desert in June 1865 while serving in Taranaki. Bent was found by a local MƒÅori chief of the NgƒÅti Ruanui iwi in South Taranaki and eventually became accepted as a part of the local tribe. He fell in with Titokowaru's followers in 1867 and fought with them against the colonists in what has become known as Titokowaru's War until their eventual defeat in 1869. Bent then went into hiding first in the backblocks of Taranaki and later in Wairau, Blenheim. He spent his remaining years working in several trades including as a builder, fisherman, horticulturist, tattooist, traditional healer using Maori medicine and even a confectioner. He remained a wanted deserter with a reward on his head for many years, but eventually the authorities stopped looking for him. In 1903 he was rediscovered, and a book was written about his life by James Cowan. Entitled The adventures of Kimble Bent: a story of wild life in the New Zealand bush, it was something of sensation at the time. He died in Wairau Hospital on 22 May 1916. and was buried in an unmarked grave in the Omaka Cemetery Number One Lawn. The location of his grave in this cemetery is only known to descendants of the family whom he lived with in his final years.https://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/7730247/Resting-spot-to- remain-a-secret More recently, his tale has been fictionalised by New Zealand author Maurice Shadbolt in his 1990 historical novel Monday's Warriors and in the 2011 graphic novel, Kimble Bent Malcontent: The Wild Adventures of a Runaway Soldier in Old-Time New Zealand by Chris Grosz.

An element x of G is called positive element if 0 ‚â§ x. The set of elements 0 ‚â§ x is often denoted with G+, and it is called the positive cone of G. So we have if and only if By the definition, we can reduce the partial order to a monadic property: a ‚â§ b if and only if 0 ‚â§ -a + b. For the general group G, the existence of a positive cone specifies an order on G. A group G is a partially ordered group if and only if there exists a subset H (which is G+) of G such that: * 0 ‚àà H * if a ‚àà H and b ‚àà H then a + b ‚àà H * if a ‚àà H then -x + a + x ‚àà H for each x of G * if a ‚àà H and -a ‚àà H then a = 0 A partially ordered group G with positive cone G+ is said to be unperforated if n ¬∑ g ‚àà G+ for some positive integer n implies g ‚àà G+. Being unperforated means there is no \\"gap\\" in the positive cone G+. If the order on the group is a linear order, then it is said to be a linearly ordered group. If the order on the group is a lattice order, i.e. any two elements have a least upper bound, then it is a lattice-ordered group (shortly l-group, though usually typeset with a script l: ‚Ñì-group). A Riesz group is an unperforated partially ordered group with a property slightly weaker than being a lattice ordered group. Namely, a Riesz group satisfies the Riesz interpolation property: if x1, x2, y1, y2 are elements of G and xi ‚â§ yj, then there exists z ‚àà G such that xi ‚â§ z ‚â§ yj. If G and H are two partially ordered groups, a map from G to H is a morphism of partially ordered groups if it is both a group homomorphism and a monotonic function. The partially ordered groups, together with this notion of morphism, form a category. Partially ordered groups are used in the definition of valuations of fields.  Examples  * The integers * An ordered vector space is a partially ordered group * A Riesz space is a lattice-ordered group * A typical example of a partially ordered group is Zn, where the group operation is componentwise addition, and we write (a1,...,an) ‚â§ (b1,...,bn) if and only if ai ‚â§ bi (in the usual order of integers) for all i = 1,..., n. * More generally, if G is a partially ordered group and X is some set, then the set of all functions from X to G is again a partially ordered group: all operations are performed componentwise. Furthermore, every subgroup of G is a partially ordered group: it inherits the order from G. * If A is an approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra, or more generally, if A is a stably finite unital C*-algebra, then K0(A) is a partially ordered abelian group.

He had two siblings, sister Jean Conan Doyle and brother Denis, as well as two half-siblings, sister Mary and brother Kingsley. Adrian has been depicted as a race-car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer. Biographer Andrew Lycett calls him a \\"spendthrift playboy\\" who (with his brother Denis) \\"used the Conan Doyle estate as a milch-cow\\".Lycett, p. 464. He married Danish-born Anna Andersen, and was his father's literary executor after his mother died in 1940. He founded the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Foundation in Switzerland in 1965. On his death, Jean took over as their father's literary executor. Additional Sherlock Holmes stories Adrian Doyle produced additional Sherlock Holmes stories, some with the assistance of John Dickson Carr. The basis of his production was to complete those tales referenced in his father's stories, which his father had never written. (Carr had published an \\"authorized\\" biography of Sir Arthur in 1949.) These additional Sherlock Holmes tales were written in 1952 and 1953, and a hardcover collection of the stories was published as The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes in 1954. They have been reissued subsequently, while other authors have also written Sherlock Holmes stories based on the same references within the original tales. Discovery of unpublished Holmes story On 12 September 1942, the Associated Press announced that an authentic, unpublished Sherlock Holmes story had been found by Adrian Conan Doyle. Supposedly written in his father's uniquely neat handwriting, the story was buried in a chest that contained family documents. (Actually, Jon Lellenberg reported in 1990, the manuscript was not in Sir Arthur's handwriting but typewritten.) Sir Arthur's daughter Jean said she knew the manuscript was not written by her father. Adrian Conan Doyle refused to publish it. A month later, The Baker Street Irregulars wrote a letter to the Saturday Review of Literature, insisting that the story be published. In the United States, Cosmopolitan magazine obtained it and published it in their August 1948 issue under the uncharacteristic title \\"The Case of the Man who was Wanted\\". It was also published in London's Sunday Dispatch magazine the following January. Sherlock Holmes expert Vincent Starrett doubted that the story was written by the elder Doyle and suggested that Adrian was the author. In September 1945, a letter was received by Hesketh Pearson, a biographer of Sir Arthur. The letter stated, \\"My pride is not unduly hurt by your remark that 'The Man who was Wanted' is certainly not up to scratch for the sting is much mitigated by your going on to remark that it carries the authentic trade-mark! This, I feel, is a great compliment to my one and only effort at plagiarism.\\" The letter was written by an architect named Arthur Whitaker who had sent the story to Arthur Conan Doyle in 1911 with a suggestion that they publish it as a joint collaboration. Doyle refused, but sent Whitaker a \\"cheque for ten guineas\\" in payment for the story.The amount of the payment is quoted in the introduction to The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. After seeing it attributed to Sir Arthur in the Sunday Dispatch, Whitaker wrote a letter to Denis Conan Doyle explaining the true authorship. Denis forwarded the letter to his brother Adrian, who became angry, demanded proof, and threatened legal action. Whitaker had retained a carbon copy and the Doyles admitted in 1949, after seeing the carbon copy and listening to people who had read it in 1911, that Whitaker was the author. The story that many people had accepted as the work of Sir Arthur has since been published as \\"The Adventure of the Sheffield Banker\\" in the collection The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Works about his father Sir Arthur's widow Jean chose a spiritualist, the Rev. John Lamond, to write an authorised life of him, Arthur Conan Doyle: A Memoir (John Murray, 1931). The memoir emphasised his paranormal interests but was not what readers wanted, so after their mother's death Adrian and Denis grudgingly allowed Hesketh Pearson to write Conan Doyle: His Life and Art (Methuen, 1943). But Pearson's book offended Adrian and Denis by saying that the secret of their father's success was that he was the \\"common man\\". Adrian threatened criminal proceedings against Pearson's \\"fakeography\\", and wrote an article in protest, and later, a book: The True Conan Doyle (John Murray, 1945). According to Lycett, \\"When the BBC commissioned an anniversary talk from Hesketh Pearson, Adrian announced that if it went ahead it would never broadcast another Sherlock Holmes story. The Corporation caved in.\\"Lycett, pp. 464‚Äì66.

They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, but they are not nearly as sharp as sewing needles. Their purpose is two- fold. The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously. The size of a needle is described first by its diameter and secondly by its length. The size of the new stitch is determined in large part by the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn- loop drawn through the previous stitch. Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. Various sizing systems for needles are in common use. Types Knitting needles in a variety of sizes and materials. Different materials have varying amounts of friction, and are suitable for different yarn types. =Single-pointed needles= The most widely recognized form of needle is the single-pointed needle. It is a slender, straight stick tapered to a point at one end, with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are always used in pairs and are usually 10-16 inches (25.4‚Äì40.6 cm) long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. Fictional depictions of knitting in movies, television programs, animation, and comic strips almost always show knitting done on straight needles. Both Wallace and Gromit and Monty Python, for example, show this type of knitting. =Double-pointed needles= Double- pointed knitting needles in various materials and sizes. They come in sets of four, five or six. The oldest type of needle is the straight double-pointed needle. Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end. They are typically used (and sold) in sets of four and five, and are commonly used for circular knitting. Since the invention of the circular needle, they have been most commonly used to knit smaller tube- shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks. Usually two needles are active while the others hold the remaining stitches. Double-pointed needles are somewhat shorter than single-pointed or circular needles, and are usually used in the 13‚Äì20 cm length range, although they are also made longer. Double- pointed needles are depicted in a number of 14th-century oil paintings, typically called Knitting Madonnas, depicting Mary knitting with double- pointed needles (Rutt, 2003). A cable needle is sometimes used. A cable needle is a special type of double-pointed needle that is typically very short and used to hold a very small number of stitches temporarily while the knitter is forming a cable pattern. They are often U-shaped, or have a U-shaped bend, to keep the held stitches from falling off while the primary needle is being used. =Circular needles= Circular knitting needles in different lengths, materials and sizes, including plastic, aluminum, steel and nickel-plated brass. The first US patent for a circular needle was issued in 1918, although in Europe they may have been used a little earlier. Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both knitting flat or knitting in the round. The two tapered ends, typically 4‚Äì5 inches (10.5‚Äì13 cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or coated wire). The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from to or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting. In using circulars to knit flat pieces of fabric the two ends are used just as two separate needles would be. The knitter holds one tip in each hand and knits straight across the width of the fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls back the other way. Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms. The lack of a purl row in stockinette stitch, since in the round (commonly referred to as ITR) knitting is all done using the knit stitch, is often perceived to be one of the greatest benefits of ITR. Knitting ITR with circulars is done in a spiral, the same way as using double-pointed needles (usually called DPNs). Additionally, circulars eliminate the need to continually switch from one needle to the next, and there is no possibility of stitches falling off the back end of the needles, as may happen when using DPNs. Much larger tubes may be knit ITR, too, helping items to be completed more quickly. Construction of garments such as sweaters may be greatly simplified when knitting ITR, since the finishing steps of sewing a back, two fronts, and two sleeves of a sweater together may be almost entirely eliminated in neck down ITR knitting. Knitting educator and authority Elizabeth Zimmermann helped popularize knitting ITR specifically with circular needles. The Magic Loop method may be used to produce narrow tubular items such as socks. Numerous techniques have been devised for the production of narrow tubular knitting on circular needles. One common method is to use two needles in place of the four or five double-pointed needles traditionally used, while a newer technique is to use one circular needle that is significantly longer than the circumference of the item being knitted. This technique is known as Magic Loop and has recently become a popular method of producing tubular knitting, as only one needle is required.Morgan-Oakes, Melissa. Toe-Up 2-at-a-Time Socks. Storey Publishing LLC, 2010. . The Guinness World Record for knitting with the largest knitting needles Julia Hopson and her world record needles The current holder of this title is Julia Hopson of Penzance in Cornwall. Julia knitted a tension square of ten stitches and ten rows in stocking stitch using knitting needles that were 6.5 cm in diameter and 3.5 metres long. Needle materials In addition to common wood and metal needles, antique knitting needles were sometimes made from tortoiseshell, ivory and walrus tusks; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species, and needles made from them are virtually impossible to find. There are, however, a now vintage style of needle which appears to be tortoiseshell, but is actually made from a celluloid, sometimes known as shellonite. These needles were made in Australia, but are no longer manufactured. Modern knitting needles are made of bamboo, aluminium, steel, wood, plastic, glass, casein and carbon fibers. Needle storage Container for needles A tall, cylindrical container with padding on the bottom to keep the points sharp can store straight needles neatly. Fabric or plastic cases similar to cosmetic bags or a chef's knife bag allow straight needles to be stored together yet separated by size, then rolled to maximize space. Circular needles may be stored with the cables coiled in cases made specifically for this purpose or hung dangling from a hanger device with cables straight. If older circulars with the nylon or plastic cables are coiled for storage it may be necessary to soak them in hot water for a few minutes to get them to uncoil and relax for ease of use. Most recently manufactured cables eliminate this problem and may be stored coiled without any difficulty. Care must be taken not to kink the metal cables of older circulars, as these kinks will not come out and may damage or snag yarn as it is knit.Knitting needles with yarn Needle gauge A needle gauge makes it possible to determine the size of a knitting needle. Some may also be used to gauge the size of crochet hooks. Most needles come with the size written on them, but with use and time, the label often wears off, and many needles (like double-pointed needles) tend not to be labelled. Needle gauges can be made of any material, but are often made of metal and plastic. They tend to be about 3 by 5 inches. There are holes of various sizes through which the needles are passed to determine which hole they fit best, and often a ruler along the edge for determining the tension (also called gauge) of a sample. Needle sizes and conversions knitting in the round\\". Needles with their size in mm In the UK, the metric system is used. Previously, needles 'numbers' were the Standard Wire Gauge designation of the wire from which metal needles were made. The origin of the numbering system is uncertain but it is thought that needle numbers were based on the number of increasingly fine dies that the wire had to be drawn through. This meant thinner needles had a larger number. In the current US system, things are opposite, that is, smaller numbers indicate smaller needles. There is an \\"old US system\\" that is divided into standard and steel needles, the latter being fine lace needles. Occasionally, older lace patterns will refer to these smaller needles in the old measurement system. Finally, there was a system used in continental Europe that predated the metric system. It is largely obsolete, but some older or reprinted patterns call for pins in these sizes. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Metric size (mm) !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  US size !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Old UK size !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Japanese size !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Old US Standard !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Old US Steel !- style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Old Continental - align=\\"center\\" 0.5  8/0  24     8/0 - align=\\"center\\" 0.7  6/0  22     6/0 - align=\\"center\\" 1  5/0  19    18 5/0 - align=\\"center\\" 1.1       4/0 - align=\\"center\\" 1.25  4/0  18    16  000 - align=\\"center\\" 1.5  000  17    15 00 - align=\\"center\\" 1.75  00  15    14  0 - align=\\"center\\" 2.0  0  14   0  13  1 - align=\\"center\\" 2.1    0    - align=\\"center\\" 2.25  1  13    12  - align=\\"center\\" 2.4    1    - align=\\"center\\" 2.5  1 ¬Ω    1   2 - align=\\"center\\" 2.7    2    - align=\\"center\\" 2.75  2  12   2  11  - align=\\"center\\" 3.0  2 ¬Ω  11  3  3  10  2 ¬Ω - align=\\"center\\" 3.25  3  10     - align=\\"center\\" 3.3    4    - align=\\"center\\" 3.5  4    4  9  3 - align=\\"center\\" 3.6    5    - align=\\"center\\" 3.75  5  9   5  8  - align=\\"center\\" 3.9    6    - align=\\"center\\" 4.0  6  8     4 - align=\\"center\\" 4.25    7  6   - align=\\"center\\" 4.5  7  7  8    5 - align=\\"center\\" 4.75    9  7   6 - align=\\"center\\" 5.0  8  6   8   7 - align=\\"center\\" 5.1    10    - align=\\"center\\" 5.25     9   - align=\\"center\\" 5.4    11    - align=\\"center\\" 5.5  9  5     8 - align=\\"center\\" 5.75    12 10   - align=\\"center\\" 6.0  10  4  13    9 - align=\\"center\\" 6.3    14    - align=\\"center\\" 6.5  10 ¬Ω  3   10 ¬Ω   10 - align=\\"center\\" 6.6    15    - align=\\"center\\" 7.0   2  7 mm    11 - align=\\"center\\" 7.5   1     12 - align=\\"center\\" 8.0  11  0  8 mm    13 - align=\\"center\\" 9.0  13  00  9 mm    14 - align=\\"center\\" 10.0  15  000  10 mm    15 - align=\\"center\\" 11.0       17 - align=\\"center\\" 12.5  17      - align=\\"center\\" 13.0       19 - align=\\"center\\" 14.0  18      - align=\\"center\\" 16.0  19   16 mm    - align=\\"center\\" 19.0  35      - align=\\"center\\" 25.0  50   25 mm    } See also * Crochet hook * Knitting needle cap * Needle card References Further reading *Thomas, Mary.

It stars Corinne Griffith and tells the story of the love affair between Horatio Nelson and Emma Hamilton. It featured the theme song \\"Lady Divine\\", with lyrics by Richard Kountz and music by Nathaniel Shilkret, which became a popular hit in 1929 and was recorded by numerous artists, such as Shilkret, Frank Munn, Ben Selvin (as the Cavaliers), Smith Ballew, Adrian Schubert, Sam Lanin, and Bob Haring. The film was adapted by Harry Carr, Forrest Halsey, Agnes Christine Johnston, and Edwin Justus Mayer from the novel The Divine Lady: A Romance of Nelson and Emma Hamilton by E. Barrington. It was directed by Frank Lloyd. The film won the Academy Award for Best Director and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Corinne Griffith) and Best Cinematography.The Divine Lady at silentera.com database; accessed October 25, 2015. It is the only film to be awarded Best Director without a Best Picture nomination (one year earlier, Two Arabian Knights was awarded for Best Director of a Comedy Picture without being nominated for Best Picture). Plot In the late eighteenth century, Lady Hamilton has had a somewhat turbulent relationship with the British people, especially the aristocracy. Born Emma Hart from a very humble background (she being the daughter of a cook), she was seen as being vulgar by the rich, but equally captivating for her beauty. In a move to protect his inheritance, Honorable Charles Greville, Emma's then lover and her mother's employer, sent Emma to Naples under false pretenses to live with his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, where she would study to become a lady. Surprisingly to Greville whose deception Emma would eventually discover, Emma ended up becoming Hamilton's wife in a marriage of convenience. But it is Emma's eventual relationship with Horatio Nelson of the British navy that would cause the largest issue. A move by Lady Hamilton helped Nelson's armada defeat Napoleon's fleet in naval battles, which Nelson would have ultimately lost without Lady Hamilton's help. Beyond the dangers of war, Lady Hamilton and Nelson's relationship is ultimately threatened by the court of public opinion as both are married to other people.

It was produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) until 2013, when the brand was sold to Suntory. The brand originally had a strong reputation as a healthy product for children, stemming from its distribution to children as a vitamin C supplement during World War II by the British government. Beecham, a company that has been part of GSK since 2000, bought the brand in 1955 and developed many soft drink versions. A series of scandals in the 2000s, concerning vitamin C levels, sugar levels, and the amounts of actual fruit in some of the brands, damaged its reputation as a healthy product. By 2013, the brand was widely regarded as a soft drink. In 2013, annual worldwide sales were around ¬£500 million. That year, GSK sold Ribena and another consumer line, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for ¬£1.35 billion. In April 2018, in the United Kingdom, Ribena's longstanding recipe was changed by the addition of artificial sweeteners in response to the introduction of a sugary drinks tax by the UK government.  History  Ribena was originally manufactured by the Bristol-based food and drink company HW Carter as a blackcurrant squash.. Development research into pure fruit syrups for the manufacture of milkshakes had been done at the Long Ashton Agriculture and Horticulture Research Station in North Somerset using a pectinase enzyme process; Ribena was essentially invented there by Vernon Charley, a scientist at the University of Bristol in 1933. The blackcurrant variety was found to contain high levels of vitamin C. The drink was launched in 1938 under the name Ribena (from the botanical name for the blackcurrant, Ribes nigrum). =Second World War= During the Second World War, other fruits rich in vitamin C, like oranges, became almost impossible to obtain in the United Kingdom, due to German submarine attacks on cargo ships. Blackcurrant cultivation was encouraged by the government, and the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942, almost the entire British blackcurrant crop was made into blackcurrant syrup (or cordial), almost all of it manufactured by Carters, and it was bought by the government and distributed to the nation's children for free, without the Ribena brand name, giving rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant flavourings in Britain. =Post-war= Production moved to the new Royal Forest Factory at Coleford in the Forest of Dean in late 1947, where production takes place today. Carters was bought out by the Beecham Group in 1955.. In 1989, Beecham and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham, and in 2000, SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Through the years GSK and its predecessors developed many soft drink versions of Ribena but it retained an image as a \\"healthy food\\" in the UK and other Commonwealth countries.. In 2001, a formulation of the diluted Ribena cordial, sold as Ribena Toothkind (and endorsed by the British Dental Association as being less damaging to teeth than other soft drinks), was judged by the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority to have been advertised in a misleading manner, and claims that the drink did not encourage tooth decay should be removed from the packaging. The opinion was upheld by a hearing in the High Court. In 2003, the Food Commission in the United Kingdom criticised the sugar levels in regular Ribena as contributing to childhood obesity. In 2004, two high school students in New Zealand conducted a science experiment to determine the vitamin C levels of their favourite fruit drinks. They discovered that the \\"Ready to Drink Ribena\\" product they tested had undetectable levels of vitamin C, counter to the brand's reputation and advertisements which said that \\"the blackcurrants in Ribena contain four times the vitamin C of oranges\\". They contacted GSK, which did not respond to them, and their story was picked up by the television consumer affairs show Fair Go, which broadcast the story nationwide in October 2004. Following further testing, in March 2007, the New Zealand Commerce Commission brought 15 charges in the Auckland District Court against GlaxoSmithKline under the Fair Trading Act. In March 2007, GSK pleaded guilty and was fined NZ$217,500 by Auckland District Court for misleading consumers, and were ordered to run a series of corrective advertisements and place a statement on its website. GSK maintained the issue only affects Australia and New Zealand, and Ribena products sold in other markets, such as the United Kingdom, contain the levels of vitamin C stated on the product label. Carton design introduced in January 2007 In 2007, a study conducted by the Australian Consumers' Association for Choice magazine in January 2007 reported that blackcurrant juice (from concentrate) only constituted 5% of the Ribena fruit drink product. By 2013, the brand had annual worldwide sales of about ¬£500 million. In April 2013, GSK put Ribena, along with Lucozade, up for sale to focus on its pharmaceutical business.. The eventual sale to Japanese company Suntory for ¬£1.35 billion was announced in September 2013..  See also  * Tango ‚Äì similarly bought by Beecham in the 1950s but sold in 1986.

He has published numerous works of fiction, some of which were adapted as feature films. He was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel The Mosquito Coast, which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He is the father of British authors and documentary filmmakers Marcel and Louis Theroux, the brother of authors Alexander Theroux and Peter Theroux, and uncle of the American actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux. Early life Theroux was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the third of seven children, and son of Catholic parents; his mother, Anne (n√©e Dittami), was Italian American, and his father, Albert Eugene Theroux, was of French-Canadian descent. His mother was a former grammar school teacher and painter, and his father was a shoe factory leather salesman for the American Leather Oak company,Current Biography Yearbook, H. W. Wilson Co., 1979, page 415 residing at 11 Belle Avenue in Medford, Massachusetts. Theroux was a Boy Scout and ultimately achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. His brothers are Eugene, Alexander, Joseph and Peter. His sisters are Ann Marie and Mary. Theroux was educated at Medford High School, followed by the University of Maine, in Orono, (1959‚Äì60) and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he obtained a B.A. in English in 1963. Career After he finished his university education, Theroux joined the Peace Corps in 1963 as a teacher in Malawi. A new program, the Peace Corps had sent its first volunteers overseas in 1961. Theroux helped a political opponent of Prime Minister Hastings Banda escape to Uganda. For this, Theroux was expelled from Malawi and thrown out of the Peace Corps. He was declared persona non grata by Banda in Malawi for sympathizing with Yatuta Chisiza.Living on the Edge: Paul Theroux, Peace Corps Writers As a consequence, his later novel Jungle Lovers, which concerns an attempted coup in the country, was banned in Malawi for many years. He moved to Uganda in 1965 to teach English at Makerere University, where he also wrote for the magazine Transition. While at Makerere, Theroux began his friendship with Rajat Neogy, founder of Transition Magazine, and novelist V.S. Naipaul, then a visiting scholar at the university.Patrick French's biography of VS Naipaul: Naipaul's friendship with Paul Theroux, Daily Telegraph, 23 Mar 2008 During his time in Uganda, an angry mob at a demonstration threatened to overturn the car in which his pregnant wife was riding.Dave McKean, Barron Storey, Marshall Arisman, Bill Sienkiewicz, Paul Theroux. Edge. Vanguard Productions (NJ), 2003, page 60 This incident may have contributed to their decision to leave Africa. The couple moved with their son Marcel to Singapore, where a second son, Louis, was born. After two years of teaching at the National University of Singapore, Theroux and his family settled in the United Kingdom in November 1971. They lived first in Dorset, and then in south London. When his marriage ended, early in 1990, Theroux returned to the United States, where he has since settled. Literary work Theroux published his first novel, Waldo (1967), during his time in Uganda; it was moderately successful. He published several more novels over the next few years, including Fong and the Indians, Jungle Lovers, and The Mosquito Coast. On his return to Malawi many years later, he found that Jungle Lovers, which was set in that country, was still banned. He recounted that in his book Dark Star Safari (2002).Dark Star Safari by Paul Theroux, page 329, Penguin edition publ. 2002, After moving to London in 1972, Theroux set off on an epic journey by train from Great Britain to Japan and back. His account of this journey was published as The Great Railway Bazaar, his first major success as a travel writer and now a classic in the genre.Travelliterature.org He has since written a number of travel books, including traveling by train from Boston to Argentina (The Old Patagonian Express), walking around the United Kingdom (The Kingdom by the Sea), kayaking in the South Pacific (The Happy Isles of Oceania), visiting China (Riding the Iron Rooster), and traveling from Cairo to Cape Town across Africa (Dark Star Safari). In 2015, he published \\"Deep South\\" detailing 4 road trips through the southern states of the United States. He is noted for his rich descriptions of people and places, laced with a heavy streak of irony, or even misanthropy. Nonfiction by Theroux includes Sir Vidia's Shadow, an account of his personal and professional friendship with Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, which ended abruptly after 30 years. Personal life His 2017 semi-autobiographical novel Mother Land (and an earlier related short story published in The New Yorker magazine and set in Puerto Rico) refer to an older son born from a college relationship; he and his unmarried partner are said to have given the boy up for adoption. When Theroux was in Uganda, his friends found him a teaching position at Makerere University in Kampala. There he met Anne Castle, a British graduate student teaching at an upcountry girls' secondary school in Kenya, via Voluntary Service Overseas. They married in 1967. After leaving Asia and Dorset, they moved to South London, England in 1971, because it was cheaper than the United States. They had two sons: Marcel and Louis, both of whom are writers and documentarians. Theroux and Castle divorced in 1993. Theroux married a second time to Sheila Donnelly, on November 18, 1995. His wife runs a luxury travel/hotel PR agency. They reside in Hawaii and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\\"Famous Author Summers in Sandwich\\", Cape Cod Today, 3 September 2008 Controversy By including versions of himself, his family and acquaintances in some of his fiction, Theroux has occasionally disconcerted his readers. \\"A. Burgess, Slightly Foxed: Fact and Fiction\\", a story published in 1995 in The New Yorker,The New Yorker, August 7, 1995. describes a dinner at the narrator's home with author Anthony Burgess and a book-hoarding lawyer, who nags the narrator for an introduction to the great writer. Burgess arrives drunk and mocks the lawyer, who introduces himself as a fan. The narrator's wife is named Anne, and she refuses to help with the dinner. The magazine later published a letter from Anne Theroux denying that Burgess was ever a guest in their home and expressing admiration for him, having once interviewed the real Burgess for the BBC: \\"I was dismayed to read in your August 7th edition a story ‚Ä¶ by Paul Theroux, in which a very unpleasant character with my name said and did things that I have never said or done.\\"The New Yorker, September 18, 1995, p.14. When the story was incorporated into Theroux's novel, My Other Life (1996), the wife was renamed \\"Alison\\", and reference to her work at the BBC was excluded. Theroux's sometimes caustic portrait of Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul in his memoir Sir Vidia's Shadow (1998) contrasts sharply with his earlier, admiring portrait of the same author in V. S. Naipaul: An Introduction to his Work (1972). They had a long friendship, but Theroux said that events during the 26 years between the two books colored his perspective in the later book. The two authors attempted a reconciliation in 2011. His novel Jungle Lovers (1971) was banned by the government in Malawi for many years, as he had been expelled from the country for getting political involved. His novel Saint Jack (1973) was banned by the government of Singapore for 30 years.Paul Theroux, Ghost Train to the Eastern Star, p. 320. Both were banned because they were considered too critical of the government's leader(s), or cast the country in an unfavorable light. Theroux has criticized entertainer Bono, and actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as \\"mythomaniacs, people who wish to convince the world of their worth.\\" He has said that \\"the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help‚Äînot to mention celebrities and charity concerts‚Äîis a destructive and misleading conceit\\". A review of Dark Star Safari (2003) in Foreign Affairs Nov/Dec 2003, described Theroux's portrait of Africahttps://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2003-11-01/dark- star-safari-overland-cairo-cape-town: > Before Theroux became a popular author of novels and travelogues, he was a > Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi and an instructor at Makerere University in > Uganda.

Theroux has said that when he was in his early 20s, and joined the Peace Corps and went to Africa, he was an \\"angry and agitated young man\\". He felt he had to escape the confines of Massachusetts and a hostile U.S. foreign policy. He says he now has \\"the disposition of a hobbit,\\" and remains optimistic about most of his subject matter. \\"I need happiness in order to write well...being depressed merely produces depressing literature in my case,\\" he explains.Interview with Eleanor Wachtel, CBC Radio, 30th International Festival of Authors, Toronto, October 25, 2009. In an op-ed in The New York Times on October 22, 2016, Theroux recommended that President Obama pardon John Walker Lindh. In the article, he compared his own Peace Corps volunteer outing in Malawi to the convicted American citizen who fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Some states have awarded long-term contracts to (usually 10 to 15 years), in others, DB Regio's operations are decreasing, in North Rhine-Westphalia, their market share is expected to be lower than 50%. rail services are divided into several regional companies: * for Schleswig- Holstein, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Bremen * for Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern * for North Rhine-Westphalia * for Saxony, Saxony- Anhalt, Thuringia * for Hesse * for Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, parts of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Hesse * for the rest of Baden-W√ºrttemberg * for Bavaria  (small, independent networks, like Erzgebirgsbahn, G√§ubodenbahn, Kurhessenbahn, Oberwei√übacher Bergbahn, S√ºdostbayernbahn, Westfrankenbahn for easier organisation) The bus services consist of 25 bus companies, which have subsidiary companies themselves. = Infrastructure =  DB Netze  The infrastructure division is divided into the DB Netz (rail infrastructure), DB Station&Service; (stations and services) and DB Energie (Energy) business units.  DB Engineering&Consulting;  DB Engineering & Consulting, which is responsible for construction supervision, construction planning and maintenance, is also assigned to this department without being part of a business area. Via its subsidiary DB Engineering&Consulting;, DB signed a memorandum of understanding with Iranian rail operator Bonyad Eastern Railways (BonRail) in May 2017 and shortly after a consulting contract with Islamic Republic of Iran Railways; both projects were abandoned after the United States imposed new sanctions against Iran and said firms doing business with Iran would be barred from doing business with the United States.Gernot Heller and Douglas Busvine (August 16, 2018), German rail operator, Deutsche Telekom end Iran projects Reuters.

On January 1, 1994, and were merged to form one company, and so, they became . At the same time, adopted its current logo and DB abbreviation. modernised the logo and typographer designed a new corporate font known as DB Type. When Deutsche Bahn was formed in January 1994, it became a joint stock-company, and were designed to operate the railways of both the former East and West Germany after unification in October 1990 as a single, uniform, and private company.\\"The foundation of Deutsche Bahn AG\\" company website There are three main periods of development in this unified German railway: its formation, its early years (1994‚Äì1999), and the period from 1999 to the present. Originally, DBAG had its headquarters in but moved to in central Berlin in 1996, where it occupies a 26-storey office tower designed by at the eastern end of the Sony Center and named . As the lease was to expire in 2010, DB had announced plans to relocate to , and in 2007 a proposal for a new headquarters by 3XN Architects won an architectural competition which also included Foster + Partners, and . However, these plans were put on hold due to the financial crisis of 2008, and the lease was extended.http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/:Deutsche%20Bahn%20Pl%E4ne%20Umzug/346601.html Construction of the new headquarters building was started in 2017 under the title \\"Cube Berlin\\" according to the designs by 3XN. Finished in February 2020, the Cube will house the legal offices of Deutsche Bahn, but not become the main headquarters. = 1999 to present = The second step of the (railway reform) was carried out in 1999. All rolling stock, track, personnel, and real assets were divided between the subsidiaries of DBAG: (long-distance passenger service, later renamed (operating the stations). This new organisational scheme was introduced not least to implement European Community directive 91/440/EEC that demands access to railway systems free of discrimination. In December 2007, DB reorganised again, bringing all passenger services into its arm, logistics under and infrastructure and operations under . The DB is owned by the Federal Republic. By the Constitution, the Federal Republic is required to retain (directly or indirectly) a majority of the infrastructure (the present ) stocks. In 2008, it was agreed to \\"float\\" a portion of the business, meaning an end to the 100% share the German Federal Republic had in it, with a plan that 25% of the overall share would be sold to the private sector.\\"Partial sale of DB agreed\\" Railway Gazette International May 2008 page 289 However the onset of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 saw this cancelled.\\"DB flotation on hold\\" Railway Gazette International November 2008 page 843 In 2014, the Jewish community of Thessaloniki demanded that the , which is the successor of the , should reimburse the heirs of Greek Holocaust victims of Thessaloniki for train fares that they were forced to pay for their deportation from Thessaloniki to and Treblinka between March and August 1943.One way tickets Thessaloniki ‚Äì Auschwitz , June 2015Zug der Erinnerung/Thessaloniki Zug der Erinnerung (non-government organisation ‚ÄúTrain of Commemoration‚Äù). In June 2018 controversy grew in the United Kingdom over widespread cancellations of railway services and numerous delayed services operated by Deutsche Bahn in Britain, under its Northern brand. This resulted in Britain's Minister of Transport, Chris Grayling, setting up an enquiry into whether the Deutsche Bahn subsidiary had breached its contractual agreement to provide railway services in the north of England. He warned that if the company was found to be in breach of its contractual agreements it could be banned from running railway services in the United Kingdom.Gwyn Topham, Helen Pidd and Pippa Crerar, 'Northern and GTR could be barred from rail franchises' in The Guardian (UK newspaper), 4 June 2018  Logo history  File:Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft logo.svgDeutsche Bahn's second and former logo as Deutsche Reichsbahn used from April 1, 1920 to April 26, 1945.

Structure and subsidiaries DB Cargo  Train categories  Trains in Germany are classified by their stopping pattern:\\"Produkt√ºbersicht\\" on DB AG website * (long-distance trains), also Fernzug ** ECE (EuroCity Express) for international high-speed rail services. Currently only one route from Frankfurt to Milan while other international high-speed services are called ICE International ** ICE (Intercity-Express) for high-speed long-distance train services between major cities and regions. Does also cross European borders. **EC (EuroCity) for IC trains that cross borders, and connects Germany with other countries. Can also be operated by foreign State Railways. Can have carriages from various European countries. ** IC (InterCity) for long-distance semi-high-speed services, that connects regions and cities. Serves as a \\"mini ICE\\" with trains reaching high speed (average around 160 ‚Äì 220 km/h) , but stops more frequently, and in smaller cities than ICE services. On some IC lines the trains go on older railways instead of the high speed lines the ICE takes. International IC services are usually operated As Euro-City. * (local trains) ** IRE () longer distance RE trains, that connects regions and cities. Serves as slower IC trains. IRE trains only exist in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and on the Hamburg‚ÄìBerlin route ** RE () serves regions and connects cities, and does not stop at every Station on the route. ** RB () stops at all stations on the route (except where S-Bahn is available) and is the most basic train service ** S () is rapid transit and most services stop at all stations. operate high-frequency services and are comparable with, for example, the London Overground Train categories no longer used include: * MET (Metropolitan) was a luxury train service between Hamburg and Cologne. The two special MET train sets are now used for IC and ICE services, and does still have a comfort level above the regular IC and ICE coaches * IR (), set between RE and IC was meant to connect cities and regions at a lower price, but also be used for local traffic. Replaced partly by IC, RE and IRE * SE () operated as a mixture of RE and RB: trains skipped many stations in urban areas but made all stops in the countryside. Rebranded as RE and RB. In some regions, such as Rhine-Main (Frankfurt, ), the local transit authority advertised trains as SE. Internally, DB classified them as either RE or RB, but even DB trains display \\"SE\\" on their destination boards. This ceased in December 2016. In the early days of DBAG, the most basic train categories, which were in use since the early days of rail travel in Germany, were also used: * D ( or , abbreviated from ) was the express train category and used to be the highest train category. It was replaced by IC and the even faster ICE. The trains of the car shuttle service connecting the island of Sylt with the mainland are still officially referred to as D trains * E () was the semi-fast service offering faster journeys than normal passenger trains but not at such long distances and speed as D trains, though there were some quite long running E trains. No direct successor, would be located between RE and IC * N (), the most basic form of train service stopping at all stations. When all local train services were , i.e. operating at a fixed interval (mostly one train per hour), they were rebranded as RB There are several other operators in Germany which sometimes offer other categories, also, a local transport authority or tariff associations might brand the trains in a different way than DB does. For example, in the Nuremberg region, RE and RB trains are not differentiated, but called R instead. In some regions, such as , private operators do use the RE and RB labels, in others, such as Saxony, they do not. In online and print information systems of DB, private trains officially labelled RB and RE by their operators, might get a different label, for example \\"ABR\\" for trains operated by Abellio, though on platforms, trains and maps or timetables issued by the local transport authority overseeing regional train services, these abbreviations usually do not appear.  Codeshare agreements  In conjunction with Emirates, China Airlines, TAM Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and , operates the AIRail Service between Frankfurt Airport and K√∂ln Hauptbahnhof/Bonn Hauptbahnhof, , , Hamburg, Hanover, , Munich, Nuremberg, and . has the IATA designator 2A.  Tickets  DB offers two different pricing models: * The Flexpreis (originally Normalpreis): gives full flexibility, i.e., all trains on the given date can be used on the chosen route * The Sparpreis or Super- Sparpreis is the cheaper, advanced fare. Prices for long-distance journeys start as low as ‚Ç¨19.90, but Sparpreis tickets are only valid on ICE, IC or EC trains noted on the ticket. Local trains (S, RB, RE, IRE) also accept tickets issued by local transport associations, which can also be used on buses, trams, and U-Bahn trains. DB offers concessionary fares with the BahnCard, which is available as BahnCard 25 (25% discount on Flexpreis and Sparpreis), BahnCard 50 (50% discount on Flexpreis and 25% discount on Sparpreis), and BahnCard 100 (unlimited travel on all Deutsche Bahn trains, a few private train companies and also in many local transport associations). Other special tickets, such as Interrail or the L√§nder-Tickets, give unlimited journeys on local trains and in many transport associations within a state, are also available. These L√§nder-Tickets offer group tickets, where up to five people can travel on a single ticket.

The base of the logarithm function used is of little importance in the present article, as long as it is greater than 1, but the natural logarithm with base is the one most often used. The choice of base corresponds to the choice of logarithmic unit for the value: base 2 corresponds to a shannon, base to a ‚Äúnat‚Äù, and base 10 to a hartley; these units are particularly used in information- theoretic interpretations. For each choice of base, the logit function takes values between negative and positive infinity.

History There have been several efforts to adapt linear regression methods to a domain where the output is a probability value, (0, 1), instead of any real number (-\\\\infty, +\\\\infty). In many cases, such efforts have focused on modeling this problem by mapping the range (0, 1) to (-\\\\infty, +\\\\infty) and then running the linear regression on these transformed values. In 1934 Chester Ittner Bliss used the cumulative normal distribution function to perform this mapping and called his model probit an abbreviation for \\"probability unit\\";. However, this is computationally more expensive. In 1944, Joseph Berkson used log of odds and called this function logit, abbreviation for \\"logistic unit\\" following the analogy for probit. Log odds was used extensively by Charles Sanders Peirce (late 19th century).. G. A. Barnard in 1949 coined the commonly used term log-odds;. the log-odds of an event is the logit of the probability of the event.. Uses and properties * The logit in logistic regression is a special case of a link function in a generalized linear model: it is the canonical link function for the Bernoulli distribution. * The logit function is the negative of the derivative of the binary entropy function. * The logit is also central to the probabilistic Rasch model for measurement, which has applications in psychological and educational assessment, among other areas. * The inverse-logit function (i.e., the logistic function) is also sometimes referred to as the expit function. * In plant disease epidemiology the logit is used to fit the data to a logistic model. With the Gompertz and Monomolecular models all three are known as Richards family models. * The log-odds function of probabilities is often used in state estimation algorithms because of its numerical advantages in the case of small probabilities. Instead of multiplying very small floating point numbers, log-odds probabilities can just be summed up to calculate the (log- odds) joint probability.  Comparison with probit  Comparison of the logit function with a scaled probit (i.e. the inverse CDF of the normal distribution), comparing \\\\operatorname{logit}(x) vs. \\\\tfrac{\\\\Phi^{-1}(x)}{\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi/8\\\\,}\\\\,}, which makes the slopes the same at the -origin. Closely related to the function (and logit model) are the probit function and probit model.

Because of the complexity of the optimization algorithms, almost all adaptive filters are digital filters. Adaptive filters are required for some applications because some parameters of the desired processing operation (for instance, the locations of reflective surfaces in a reverberant space) are not known in advance or are changing. The closed loop adaptive filter uses feedback in the form of an error signal to refine its transfer function. Generally speaking, the closed loop adaptive process involves the use of a cost function, which is a criterion for optimum performance of the filter, to feed an algorithm, which determines how to modify filter transfer function to minimize the cost on the next iteration. The most common cost function is the mean square of the error signal. As the power of digital signal processors has increased, adaptive filters have become much more common and are now routinely used in devices such as mobile phones and other communication devices, camcorders and digital cameras, and medical monitoring equipment. Example application The recording of a heart beat (an ECG), may be corrupted by noise from the AC mains. The exact frequency of the power and its harmonics may vary from moment to moment. One way to remove the noise is to filter the signal with a notch filter at the mains frequency and its vicinity, but this could excessively degrade the quality of the ECG since the heart beat would also likely have frequency components in the rejected range. To circumvent this potential loss of information, an adaptive filter could be used. The adaptive filter would take input both from the patient and from the mains and would thus be able to track the actual frequency of the noise as it fluctuates and subtract the noise from the recording. Such an adaptive technique generally allows for a filter with a smaller rejection range, which means, in this case, that the quality of the output signal is more accurate for medical purposes. Block diagram The idea behind a closed loop adaptive filter is that a variable filter is adjusted until the error (the difference between the filter output and the desired signal) is minimized. The Least Mean Squares (LMS) filter and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) filter are types of adaptive filter. :Adaptive Filter. k = sample number, x = reference input, X = set of recent values of x, d = desired input, W = set of filter coefficients, Œµ = error output, f = filter impulse response, * = convolution, Œ£ = summation, upper box=linear filter, lower box=adaption algorithm Adaptive Filter, compact representation. k = sample number, x = reference input, d = desired input, Œµ = error output, f = filter impulse response, Œ£ = summation, box=linear filter and adaption algorithm. There are two input signals to the adaptive filter: d_k and x_k which are sometimes called the primary input and the reference input respectively.Widrow p 304 The adaption algorithm attempts to filter the reference input into a replica of the desired input by minimizing the residual signal, \\\\epsilon_k . When the adaption is successful, the output of the filter y_k is effectively an estimate of the desired signal. : d_k which includes the desired signal plus undesired interference and : x_k which includes the signals that are correlated to some of the undesired interference in d_k . :k represents the discrete sample number. The filter is controlled by a set of L+1 coefficients or weights. :\\\\mathbf{W}_{k}=\\\\left[w_{0k},\\\\,w_{1k},\\\\, ...,\\\\,w_{Lk} \\\\right]^{T} represents the set or vector of weights, which control the filter at sample time k. ::where w_{lk} refers to the l'th weight at k'th time. :\\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta W}_{k} represents the change in the weights that occurs as a result of adjustments computed at sample time k. ::These changes will be applied after sample time k and before they are used at sample time k+1. The output is usually \\\\epsilon_k but it could be y_k or it could even be the filter coefficients.Widrow p 212(Widrow) The input signals are defined as follows: : d_k = g_k + u_k + v_k : x_k = g_{k}^' + u_{k}^' + v_{k}^' :where: ::g = the desired signal, ::g = a signal that is correlated with the desired signal g , ::u = an undesired signal that is added to g , but not correlated with g or g ::u = a signal that is correlated with the undesired signal u, but not correlated with g or g, ::v = an undesired signal (typically random noise) not correlated with g, g, u, u or v, ::v = an undesired signal (typically random noise) not correlated with g, g, u, u or v. The output signals are defined as follows: : y_k= \\\\hat{g}_k + \\\\hat{u}_k + \\\\hat{v}_k : \\\\epsilon_k = d_k-y_k . :where: :: \\\\hat{g} = the output of the filter if the input was only g, :: \\\\hat{u} = the output of the filter if the input was only u, :: \\\\hat{v} = the output of the filter if the input was only v. =Tapped delay line FIR filter= If the variable filter has a tapped delay line Finite Impulse Response (FIR) structure, then the impulse response is equal to the filter coefficients. The output of the filter is given by : y_k= \\\\sum_{l=0}^L w_{lk} \\\\ x_{(k-l)} = \\\\hat{g}_k + \\\\hat{u}_k + \\\\hat{v}_k ::where w_{lk} refers to the l'th weight at k'th time. =Ideal case= In the ideal case v \\\\equiv 0, v' \\\\equiv 0, g' \\\\equiv 0 . All the undesired signals in d_k are represented by u_k . \\\\ x_k consists entirely of a signal correlated with the undesired signal in u_k . The output of the variable filter in the ideal case is : y_k = \\\\hat{u}_k . The error signal or cost function is the difference between d_k and y_k : \\\\epsilon_k = d_k-y_k = g_k+ u_k - \\\\hat{u}_k . The desired signal gk passes through without being changed. The error signal \\\\epsilon_k is minimized in the mean square sense when [u_k - \\\\hat{u}_k] is minimized. In other words, \\\\hat{u}_k is the best mean square estimate of u_k . In the ideal case, u_k = \\\\hat{u}_k and \\\\epsilon_k = g_k , and all that is left after the subtraction is g which is the unchanged desired signal with all undesired signals removed. =Signal components in the reference input= In some situations, the reference input x_k includes components of the desired signal. This means g' ‚â† 0. Perfect cancelation of the undesired interference is not possible in the case, but improvement of the signal to interference ratio is possible. The output will be : \\\\epsilon_k = d_k-y_k = g_k - \\\\hat{g}_k+ u_k - \\\\hat{u}_k . The desired signal will be modified (usually decreased). The output signal to interference ratio has a simple formula referred to as power inversion. : \\\\rho_{\\\\mathsf{out}}(z) = \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\rho_{\\\\mathsf{ref}}(z)} . ::where ::: \\\\rho_{\\\\mathsf{out}}(z) \\\\ = output signal to interference ratio. ::: \\\\rho_{\\\\mathsf{ref}}(z) \\\\ = reference signal to interference ratio. ::: z \\\\ = frequency in the z-domain. This formula means that the output signal to interference ratio at a particular frequency is the reciprocal of the reference signal to interference ratio.Widrow p 313 Example: A fast food restaurant has a drive-up window. Before getting to the window, customers place their order by speaking into a microphone. The microphone also picks up noise from the engine and the environment. This microphone provides the primary signal. The signal power from the customer's voice and the noise power from the engine are equal. It is difficult for the employees in the restaurant to understand the customer. To reduce the amount of interference in the primary microphone, a second microphone is located where it is intended to pick up sounds from the engine. It also picks up the customer's voice. This microphone is the source of the reference signal. In this case, the engine noise is 50 times more powerful than the customer's voice. Once the canceler has converged, the primary signal to interference ratio will be improved from 1:1 to 50:1. =Adaptive Linear Combiner= :Adaptive linear combiner showing the combiner and the adaption process. k = sample number, n=input variable index, x = reference inputs, d = desired input, W = set of filter coefficients, Œµ = error output, Œ£ = summation, upper box=linear combiner, lower box=adaption algorithm. Adaptive linear combiner, compact representation. k = sample number, n=input variable index, x = reference inputs, d = desired input, Œµ = error output, Œ£ = summation. The adaptive linear combiner (ALC) resembles the adaptive tapped delay line FIR filter except that there is no assumed relationship between the X values. If the X values were from the outputs of a tapped delay line, then the combination of tapped delay line and ALC would comprise an adaptive filter. However, the X values could be the values of an array of pixels. Or they could be the outputs of multiple tapped delay lines. The ALC finds use as an adaptive beam former for arrays of hydrophones or antennas. : y_k= \\\\sum_{l=0}^L w_{lk} \\\\ x_{lk} = \\\\mathbf{W}_k^T \\\\mathbf{x}_k ::where w_{lk} refers to the l'th weight at k'th time. =LMS algorithm= If the variable filter has a tapped delay line FIR structure, then the LMS update algorithm is especially simple. Typically, after each sample, the coefficients of the FIR filter are adjusted as follows:Widrow p 100(Widrow) : for l = 0 \\\\dots L : w_{l,k+1} = w_{lk} + 2 \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\epsilon_k \\\\ x_{k-l} :::Œº is called the convergence factor. The LMS algorithm does not require that the X values have any particular relationship; therefore it can be used to adapt a linear combiner as well as an FIR filter. In this case the update formula is written as: : w_{l,k+1} = w_{lk} + 2 \\\\mu \\\\ \\\\epsilon_k \\\\ x_{lk} The effect of the LMS algorithm is at each time, k, to make a small change in each weight. The direction of the change is such that it would decrease the error if it had been applied at time k. The magnitude of the change in each weight depends on Œº, the associated X value and the error at time k. The weights making the largest contribution to the output, y_k , are changed the most. If the error is zero, then there should be no change in the weights. If the associated value of X is zero, then changing the weight makes no difference, so it is not changed. Convergence Œº controls how fast and how well the algorithm converges to the optimum filter coefficients. If Œº is too large, the algorithm will not converge. If Œº is too small the algorithm converges slowly and may not be able to track changing conditions. If Œº is large but not too large to prevent convergence, the algorithm reaches steady state rapidly but continuously overshoots the optimum weight vector. Sometimes, Œº is made large at first for rapid convergence and then decreased to minimize overshoot. Widrow and Stearns state in 1985 that they have no knowledge of a proof that the LMS algorithm will converge in all cases.Widrow p 103 However under certain assumptions about stationarity and independence it can be shown that the algorithm will converge if : 0 < \\\\mu < \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sigma^2} ::where :::\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\sum_{l=0}^L \\\\sigma_l^2 = sum of all input power :::\\\\sigma_l is the RMS value of the l 'th input In the case of the tapped delay line filter, each input has the same RMS value because they are simply the same values delayed. In this case the total power is : \\\\sigma^2 = (L+1) \\\\sigma_0^2 ::where :::\\\\sigma_0 is the RMS value of x_k, the input stream. This leads to a normalized LMS algorithm: : w_{l,k+1} = w_{lk} + \\\\left ( \\\\frac { 2 \\\\mu_{\\\\sigma} } {\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right ) \\\\epsilon_k \\\\ x_{k-l} in which case the convergence criteria becomes: 0 < \\\\mu_{\\\\sigma} < 1 . =Nonlinear Adaptive Filters= The goal of nonlinear filters is to overcome limitation of linear models. There are some commonly used approaches: Volterra LMS, Kernel adaptive filter, Spline Adaptive Filter and Urysohn Adaptive Filter.M.Poluektov and A.Polar. Urysohn Adaptive Filter. 2019.

The brewery is owned by the Japanese-controlled holding company Lion. The brewery is best known for its Gold Medal Ale, one of the best-selling beers in New Zealand. The brewery also gave rise to a chain of Speight's Ale House pubs across New Zealand.  History  The brewery was established in Dunedin in 1876 by James Speight, Charles Greenslade and William Dawson. In 1880, Speight's won a gold medal at the Melbourne International Exhibition, giving rise to the Speight's Gold Medal Ale brand. By 1887 it has become the largest brewery in New Zealand, and had expanded to a sufficient size that it exported beer to Australia the Pacific Islands. In 1923, Speight's merged with nine other brewies to form New Zealand Breweries. In 2001, production expanded to the Lion brewery in Newmarket, Auckland. \\"Brand History,\\" speights.co.nz, 2017. Retrieved 16 June 2020.  Brands  Sign at the Speight's Brewery in Dunedin Speight's Gold Medal Ale is the brewery's best known beer. Though marketed as an ale, as it was in the past, it is actually a New Zealand Draught-style lager, brewed using lager yeast and lagering techniques. In addition to its main Gold Medal Ale brand, Speight's also makes beers under the Speights Summit and the Speight's Craft ranges of beer, the latter including the Speight's Old Dark, Speight's Distinction Ale, and Speight's Triple Hop Pilsner, all of which are lagers of varying colour. Speight's also produces a cider. The Speight's Building The Speight's brewery building is a prominent landmark in central Dunedin, located just to the west of The Exchange at the corner of Rattray and Maclaggan Streets and extending up the hill into City Rise. The earliest parts of the building date back to 1876, with several major extensions and renovations in the years since, most notably extensions in 1938 designed by Harry Mandeno. The most recent renovation was to provide earthquake strengthening in 2012‚Äì14.Houlahan, Mike \\"Historic brewery gets upgrade,\\" stuff.co.nz, 17 August 2012. Retrieved 31 May 2020. Regular guided tours of the building are run by the brewery for members of the public.  Marketing  Speight's label features three eight-pointed stars. These stars come from both the original provincial arms of Otago, and the fact that Speight's was awarded gold medals at brewery awards in three different countries in 1877. The Speight's brand was removed by New Zealand Breweries in August 1960 and replaced with the Lucky brand. However, the public response was less than favourable, so the Speight's brand was brought back into production in October of that year. More recently, Speight's Southern man advertising campaign has been popular and long running. Speight's main marketing slogan, \\"Pride of the South\\", has been used in association with these advertisements for a number of years. One popular advertisement featured the Cardrona Hotel pub. Speight's later built a loose replica of this building in Mt Eden, Auckland, as part of its national marketing scheme. At the site of their Dunedin plant the company has installed a tap that pumps water up from a spring deep below the brewery, thus providing fresh, pure water free of charge. This tap was at the centre of an April Fool's joke in 1998 when the Otago Daily Times reported that, just for that day, Speight's beer would flow, free of charge, from that tap.  Sponsorship  Speight's has a long-standing relationship with rugby union in the Otago and Southland regions. In 1977, the brewery began sponsoring the Dunedin club championship. The brewery currently has sponsorship arrangements with the Otago Highlanders, Otago Rugby Football Union, and Southland Rugby Football Union.

It was the main local political machine of the Democratic Party, and played a major role in controlling New York City and New York State politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. It typically controlled Democratic Party nominations and political patronage in Manhattan after the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854, and used its patronage resources to build a loyal, well-rewarded core of district and precinct leaders; after 1850 the great majority were Irish Catholics. The Tammany Society emerged as the center for Democratic-Republican Party politics in the city in the early 19th century. After 1854, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's rapidly expanding immigrant community, which functioned as its base of political capital. The business community appreciated its readiness, at moderate cost, to cut through regulatory and legislative mazes to facilitate rapid economic growth. The Tammany Hall ward boss or ward heeler ‚Äì wards were the city's smallest political units from 1786 to 1938 ‚Äì served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage. By 1872 Tammany had an Irish Catholic \\"boss\\", and in 1928 a Tammany hero, New York Governor Al Smith, won the Democratic presidential nomination. However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for graft and political corruption, perhaps most infamously under William M. \\"Boss\\" Tweed in the mid-19th century. By the 1880s, Tammany was building local clubs that appealed to social activists from the ethnic middle class.Peel, Roy V. The Political Clubs of New York City (1935)Shefter, Martin. \\"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884‚Äì1897\\" in Joel Silbey et al. eds., The history of American electoral behavior (1978) pp: 263‚Äì98, esp pp 294‚Äì95. In quiet times the machine had the advantage of a core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of politics and policymaking in Manhattan; it also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Charles Murphy was the quiet but highly effective boss of Tammany from 1902 to 1924.Huthmacher (1965) \\"Big Tim\\" Sullivan was the Tammany leader in the Bowery, and machine's spokesman in the state legislature. In the early twentieth century Murphy and Sullivan promoted Tammany as a reformed agency dedicated to the interests of the working class. The new image deflected attacks and built up a following among the emerging ethnic middle class. In the process Robert F. Wagner became a powerful United States Senator, and Al Smith served four terms as governor and was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1928.Slayton, Robert A. Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith (2001). ch 6‚Äì15.Huthmacher, J. Joseph. Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism (1968) ch 1‚Äì4 Tammany Hall's influence waned from 1930 to 1945 when it engaged in a losing battle with Franklin D. Roosevelt, the state's governor (1928‚Äì1933) and later U.S. President (1933‚Äì1945). In 1932, Mayor Jimmy Walker was forced from office when his bribery was exposed. Roosevelt stripped Tammany of federal patronage. Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor on a Fusion ticket and became the first anti-Tammany mayor to be re-elected. A brief resurgence in Tammany power in the 1950s under the leadership of Carmine DeSapio was met with Democratic Party opposition led by Eleanor Roosevelt, Herbert Lehman, and the New York Committee for Democratic Voters. By the mid-1960s Tammany Hall ceased to exist. History Thomas Nast denounces Tammany as a ferocious tiger killing democracy. The image of a tiger was often used to represent the Tammany Hall political movement. =1789‚Äì1840= The Tammany Society, also known as the Society of St. Tammany, the Sons of St. Tammany, or the Columbian Order, was founded in New York on May 12, 1789, originally as a branch of a wider network of Tammany Societies, the first having been formed in Philadelphia in 1772.Hodge, Frederick Webb (ed.) Handbook of Indians North of Mexico (Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 30. GPO 1911), 2:683‚Äì684 The society was originally developed as a club for \\"pure Americans\\". The name \\"Tammany\\" comes from Tamanend, a Native American leader of the Lenape. The society adopted many Native American words and also their customs, going so far as to call their meeting hall a wigwam. The first Grand Sachem, as the leader was titled, was William Mooney, an upholsterer of Nassau Street.The History of New York State Although Mooney claimed the top role in the early organization, it was a wealthy merchant and philanthropist named John Pintard who created the society's constitution and declared its mission as \\"[a] political institution founded on a strong republican basis whose democratic principles will serve in some measure to correct the aristocracy of our city.\\" Pintard also established the various Native American titles of the society.Allen pp. 5-6 The Society had the political backing of the Clinton family in this era, whereas the Schuyler family backed the Hamiltonian Federalists, and the Livingstons eventually sided with the anti-federalists and the Society.Allen p.7, 10 The Society assisted the federal government in procuring a peace treaty with the Creek Indians of Georgia and Florida at the request of George Washington in 1790 and also hosted Edmond-Charles Gen√™t in 1793, representative of the New French Republic after the French Revolution toppled the old regime.Allen pp.7-10 By 1798, the society's activities had grown increasingly political. High-ranking Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr saw Tammany Hall as an opportunity to counter Alexander Hamilton's Society of the Cincinnati.\\"Sachems & Sinners: An Informal History of Tammany Hall\\" Time (August 22, 1955) Eventually Tammany emerged as the center of Democratic-Republican Party politics in the city. Burr used Tammany Hall as a campaign asset during the election of 1800, in which he acted as Democratic-Republican campaign manager. Some historians believe that without Tammany, President John Adams might have won New York State's electoral votes and won reelection.Parmet and Hecht, pp. 149‚Äì150 Early cases of political corruption involving Tammany Hall came to light during the group's feud with local politician Dewitt Clinton. The feud began in 1802 after Clinton accused Aaron Burr of being a traitor to the Democratic- Republican Party.Myers, p. 17 Clinton's uncle, George Clinton, was jealous of Burr's achievements and positions. However, George was too old to compete with young Aaron Burr, and so he left it to his nephew to topple Burr. One of Burr's political cohorts and the author of Burr's biography was a businessman, a newspaper editor, and a sachem of the Society named Matthew L. Davis. Other Burr operatives included William P. Van Ness and John Swartwout, the latter of whom dueled with De Witt Clinton in 1802 in New Jersey.Allen pp. 13,14,18 In 1803, Clinton left the United States Senate and became Mayor of New York City.Myers, p. 21 As mayor, Clinton enforced a spoils system and appointed his family and partisans to positions in the city's local government. Tammany Hall soon realized its influence over the local political scene was no match for that of Clinton, in part because Burr's support among New York City's residents greatly faded after he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel.Myers, p. 28 Tammany continued to support him for a time, but eventually pressure from the public persuaded the organization to no longer affiliate themselves with Burr. Matthew Davis would go on to refine the Society as a political machine, beginning in 1805. The Society, with Davis's guidance, received a state charter as a charitable organization, organized the General Committee of Tammany Hall, and used the General Committee to decide leadership within the Democratic-Republican party in New York City from that point forward. In December 1805, Dewitt Clinton reached out to supporters of Burr in order to gain enough support to resist the influence of the powerful Livingston family. The Livingstons, led by former New York City mayor Edward Livingston, backed New York Governor Morgan Lewis, who presented a significant challenge to Clinton.Myers, p. 23 The Tammany Hall sachems agreed to meet with Clinton in secret, on February 20, 1806, and agreed to back him, on the condition that the Clintons would once again acknowledge Aaron Burr as a Democratic-Republican and stop using \\"Burrism\\" as a reason to object to their ideas. The Clintons readily agreed to conditions, but did not intend to honor the conditions. When the Sachems caught wind of this, the feud between Tammany Hall and Clinton continued. Tammany Hall became a locally organized machine dedicated to stopping Clinton and Federalists from rising to power in New York.Myers, p. 24 However, local Democratic-Republicans began to turn against Tammany Hall.Myers, p. 26 From 1806 to 1809 public opinion forced the local Common Council to crack down on Tammany Hall. The resulting investigations found that a number of Tammany officials were guilty of embezzlement and illegal activity.Myers, pp. 27‚Äì30 For example, one official, Benjamin Romaine was found guilty of using his power to acquire land without payment and was ultimately removed from his office as City Comptroller despite the Council being controlled by Democrat-Republicans. Following the disclosures, the Federalists won control of the state legislature and the Democratic-Republican Party maintained a slim majority of the local government in New York City.Myers, p. 30 Matthew Davis convinced other sachems to join him in a public relations stunt that provided income for the Society. The shallow graves of some Revolutionary War soldiers who died in British prison ships were located in Wallabout Bay (near the Brooklyn Navy Yard). Davis announced that the Society was going to provide proper burials for these soldiers with a monument dedicated to their memory on nearby land owned by a fellow sachem. The remains were reburied. The Society led a flotilla, on April 13, 1808, in thirteen boats, to Brooklyn, with each boat carrying a symbolic coffin. A dedication ceremony was held at Wallabout Bay and the state voted to provide the Society $1,000 to build a monument. The Society pocketed the money and the monument was never built.Allen p.21 However, Tammany Hall did not learn their lesson, and instead of fixing the problem of corruption, Wortman, one of the chief powers at the time, created a committee, consisting of one member from each ward, that would investigate and report in general meetings who were friends or enemies. During 1809‚Äì1810, the feud between Tammany Hall and the Clintonites intensified, as each party continued attacking each other. One of the Clintonites, James Cheetham, wrote extensively about Tammany and its corrupt activities, using his position as State Printer and publishing his work in the American Citizen newspaper.Myers, p. 27 Tammany Hall did not take lightly to these activities and managed to remove Cheetham from his position as State Printer. At the same time, Clinton attempted to cooperate with Tammany Hall in order to create a state dominated by Democratic-Republicans. In an attempt to persuade Tammany sachems, he pulled his support for Cheetham, who was his prot√©g√© at the time. Cheetham's loss of Clinton's support angered him, and he responded by releasing details of Tammany and Clinton's attempts at cooperating to control the state. On September 18, 1810, James Cheetham died after an attack that was possibly Tammany-related. Between the years 1809 and 1815, Tammany Hall slowly revived itself by accepting immigrants and by secretly building a new wigwam to hold meetings whenever new Sachems were named.Myers, pp. 36‚Äì38 The Democratic-Republican Committee, a new committee which consisted of the most influential local Democratic Republicans, would now name the new Sachems as well.Myers, p. 38 When Dewitt Clinton decided to run for president in 1811, Tammany Hall immediately accused Clinton of treason to his party, as well as attempting to create a family aristocracy. Even though New York State voted for Clinton the following year, republicans could not help but see Clinton's actions as being exactly what Tammany had accused them of. With this, most republicans in New York City turned away from Clinton. When Tammany Hall positioned itself to support the War of 1812 and to support the Embargo Act, many others who supported the war joined Tammany Hall.Myers, p. 39 In fact, during this time, because of its success in establishing political opinion, Tammany Hall was able to grow stronger and even gained support from Federalists members who supported the war.Myers, p. 36 The Native American titles of the Society were disused during and after the War of 1812 in response to attacks from Native Americans on White Americans.Allen p. 24 During this time we see Tammany Hall's earliest application of its most notable technique- turning support away from opposing parties, and rewarding newly joined members. This was the case for Federalists who joined Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall managed to gain power, as well as reduce Clinton and his followers to just a small fraction.Myers, p. 35 In 1815, Tammany Hall grand sachem John Ferguson defeated Dewitt Clinton and was elected mayor. However, in 1817 Clinton, with his success on the Erie Canal project, gained so much popularity that despite his weak position after the War, and Tammany's immense efforts, he once again became Governor of New York and Tammany Hall, again, fell.Myers, p. 46 Another factor leading to Clinton's popularity was his patronage of immigrants. The origins of Tammany Hall were based on representing \\"pure\\" or \\"native\\" Americans. This mean that the Hall dismissed immigrants such as the Irish and Germans, although the Germans were more politically averse. In 1817, April 24, discontent for this treatment led to a huge riot during a Tammany general committee session. Martin Van Buren and his Albany Regency soon began controlling the policy of Tammany Hall. This included pushing for the state referendum that eventually granted the right to vote in New York State to all free white men in 1821. After voting rights were expanded, Tammany Hall could further increase its political power.Allen pp.27-50 Tammany Hall soon began to accept Irish immigrants as members and eventually became dependent on them to maintain viability as a political force. Until his death in 1828, Clinton would remain Governor of New York, with the exception of the two-year period of 1823‚Äì1824, and Tammany Hall's influence waned. During the 1828 U.S. presidential election, Tammany Hall leaders met with Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson and agreed to endorse him after he promised to give them control over the allocation of some federal jobs. After he was elected president, Jackson fulfilled his promise. After 1829, Tammany Hall became the city affiliate of the Democratic Party, controlling most of the New York City elections afterwards. In the 1830s the Loco-Focos, an anti-monopoly and pro-labor faction of the Democratic Party, became Tammany's main rival for votes by appealing to workingmen, however, their political opponent remained the Whigs. During the 1834 New York City mayoral governor election, the first city election whereby the mayor was elected by the popular vote, both Tammany Hall and the Whig party, from their headquarters at the Masonic Hall, battled in the streets for votes and protected polling locations in their respective regions from known opposition voters.Allen pp. 42-43 During the 1838 state election for governor, the rival Whig party imported voters from Philadelphia, paying $22 a head for votes in addition to paying for votes at their polling places. Tammany Hall operatives continued their practice of paying prisoners of the alms houses for votes and also paying for votes at their polling places.Allen pp. 36,48 Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, the Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city's ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital. The Tammany Hall \\"ward boss\\" served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage. New York City used the designation \\"ward\\" for its smallest political units from 1686‚Äì1938. The 1686 Dongan Charter divided the city into six wards and created a Common Council which consisted of an alderman and an assistant alderman elected from each ward. In 1821, the Common Council's authority was expanded so it would also elect the city's mayor, which had previously been appointed by the state government. In 1834, the state constitution was amended and required the city's mayor to be elected by direct popular vote. In 1834, Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence, a pro-Tammany Democrat, would become the first mayor ever elected by popular vote in the city's history.See \\"A Brief History of Election Law in New York\\" on the Gotham Gazette website During the 1840s, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants arrived in New York City to escape the Great Famine and Tammany saw its power grow greatly.\\"Tammany Hall: Boss Tweed & Thomas Nast\\" Racontours Tammany Ring by Thomas Nast; \\"Who stole the people's money?\\" / \\"'Twas him.\\" =Immigrant support= Tammany Hall's electoral base lay predominantly with New York's burgeoning immigrant constituency, which often exchanged political support for Tammany Hall's patronage. In pre-New Deal America, the extralegal services that Tammany and other urban political machines provided often served as a rudimentary public welfare system. At first, in the latter 1810s, immigrants were not allowed membership in Tammany Hall. However, after protests by Irish militants in 1817, and the invasion of several of their offices, Tammany Hall realized the potential influence Irish immigrants would have in the city. By the 1820s, Tammany Hall was accepting Irish immigrants as members of the group. German immigrants were also present in large numbers in the city at this time, but did not actively seek to participate in city politics.Allen However, Irish immigrants became even more influential during the mid 1840s to early 1850s. With the Potato Famine in Ireland, by 1850, more than 130,000 immigrants from Ireland lived in New York City. Since the newly arrived immigrants were in deep poverty, Tammany Hall provided them with employment, shelter, and even citizenship sometimes. For example, the group gave referrals to men looking for work, and legal aid to those who needed it. Tammany Hall would also provide food and financial aid to families with sick or injured breadwinners. In an example of their involvement in the lives of citizens, in the course of one day, Tammany figure George Washington Plunkitt assisted the victims of a house fire; secured the release of six drunks by speaking on their behalf to a judge; paid the rent of a poor family to prevent their eviction and gave them money for food; secured employment for four individuals; attended the funerals of two of his constituents (one Italian, the other Jewish); attended a Bar Mitzvah; and attended the wedding of a Jewish couple from his ward. Tammany Hall took full advantage of the surplus in Irish immigrants to create a healthy relationship to gather more votes. With this, Tammany Hall became an influential political organization in the area. Tammany Hall also served as a social integrator for immigrants by familiarizing them with American society and its political institutions and by helping them become naturalized citizens. One example was the naturalization process organized by William M. Tweed. Under Tweed's regime, \\"naturalization committees\\" were established. These committees were made up primarily of Tammany politicians and employees, and their duties consisted of filling out paperwork, providing witnesses, and lending immigrants money for the fees required to become citizens. Judges and other city officials were bribed and otherwise compelled to go along with the workings of these committees.Connable and Silberfarb, p.154 In exchange for all these benefits, immigrants assured Tammany Hall they would vote for their candidates. By 1854, the support which Tammany Hall received from immigrants would firmly establish the organization as the leader of New York City's political scene. With the election of Fernando Wood, the first person to be supported by the Tammany Hall machine, as mayor in 1854, Tammany Hall would proceed to dominate the New York City political arena until Fiorello La Guardia's mayoralty after the election of 1934. =Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves= After Fernando Wood's losing reelection run for U.S. Congress in 1842, he left politics for a while to work on his shipping business. A power vacuum of sorts existed through the 1840s for Tammany Hall, which became dominated with fights between political and basically street gangs fighting over turf. These gangs included the Dead Rabbits, the Bowery Boys, Mike Walsh's Spartan Association, the Roach Guards, the Plug Uglies, the Wide- Awakes, and Captain Isaiah Rynders' Empire Club. Rynders was the leader of Tammany's Sixth Ward and a member of the General Committee who was also said to have been responsible for coordinating all political-related gang activity. Many of these leaders coordinated their activities from saloons, which became a target of prohibitionists and reformers.Allen pp. 54-62 At the start of the 1850s, the city economy began to pick up and Tammany members would profit. The City Council of New York during these years would be known as the most corrupt up to this time. The new City Council of 1852 swept in Tammany politicians to replace the outgoing Whig ones, who did little with their power. The new council was made up of two sets of 20 members, a twenty-member Board of Aldermen and a twenty-member Board of Assistant Aldermen. This new council would be known as the Forty Thieves. Each Alderman had the power to appoint police (including precinct officers) and license saloons within his district. Together, the Aldermen possessed the power to grant franchises for streetcar lines and ferries. Each Alderman also sat as judge in criminal courts. determining who sat for juries and choosing which cases came to trial. On paper, these aldermen received no pay. A number of real estate deals followed with suspicious transaction amounts, including a purchase of a pauper's burial ground on Ward's Island and the sale of city property occupying Gansevoort Market near the western end of 14th Street to Reuben Lovejoy, an associate of James B. Taylor, a friend of many of the Aldermen. Other deals included expensive fireworks displays and bribes for ferry and railroad operations (Jacob Sharp for the Wall Street Ferry and various applicants for the Third Avenue railroad). Aldermen would also resort to creating strike legislation to obtain quick cash: A disingenuous bill would be introduced that would obviously financially harm someone, who would then complain to legislators. These legislators would then kill the bill in committee for a fee. As the press became aware of the Forty Thieves tactics, a reform movement instigated for a change in the city charter in June 1853 so that city work and supply contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder, franchises were awarded to the highest bidder, and bribery was punished harshly. =Fernando Wood era= Fernando Wood attempted several small businesses in the city during the 1830s while simultaneously increasing his involvement with Tammany Hall. These early business attempts failed, but by 1836, at the age of 24, he became a member of the Society and became known for resolving the dispute between the Loco-Focos and the conservatives of the Hall. At the age of 28, in 1840, Wood was put up by Tammany Hall for a seat to U.S. Congress, which he won. After Wood's run in Congress, he became a successful businessman in real estate dealings and was elected mayor of New York City in 1854. William Tweed said of Wood, \\"I never yet went to get a corner lot that I didn't find Wood had got in ahead of me.\\" In his first term as mayor, Wood ensured the police force was responsive to his needs and convinced commissioners to allow him to fire officers not performing their duties. He was then accused of only hiring Democrats to replace those fired officers. Wood defied tradition and ran for a second term as mayor in 1856, which irked some of his Tammany associates. During the campaign, his police force acted as his henchman and Wood took a portion of their salary for his war chest ($15 to $25 for captains and a lesser amount for patrolman). On election day, he gave his policemen some time off to vote, during which time his affiliated Dead Rabbits gang protected polling places. Wood won his second term. The Republicans, who made gains upstate, in response to this concentration of power in one man, created a new state charter for New York City which included more elected (instead of appointed) city department heads and officers. The Republicans also consolidated a separate police force, the Metropolitan Police, among the police forces of Kings, Richmond, and Westchester Counties. The Republicans in the state legislature also moved the city mayoral elections to odd years, making the next election for mayor in December 1857. A power struggle followed between Wood's Municipal Police and the Metropolitan Police, as well as between the Dead Rabbits and the nativist Bowery Boys. Tammany Hall did not put Wood up for reelection in December 1857 in light of the Panic of 1857 and a scandal involving him and his brother. Wood formed a third party, the Mozart Hall Democracy, or Mozart Hall, in response.Allen pp.52-53,63,67-76 =Tweed regime= William M. Tweed, known as \\"Boss\\" Tweed, ran an efficient and corrupt political machine based on patronage and graft. Tammany's control over the politics of New York City tightened considerably under Tweed. In 1858, Tweed utilized the efforts of Republican reformers to rein in the Democratic city government to obtain a position on the County Board of Supervisors (which he then used as a springboard to other appointments) and to have his friends placed in various offices. From this position of strength, he was elected \\"Grand Sachem\\" of Tammany, which he then used to take functional control of the city government. With his proteges elected governor of the state and mayor of the city, Tweed was able to expand the corruption and kickbacks of his \\"Ring\\" into practically every aspect of city and state governance. Although Tweed was elected to the State Senate, his true sources of power were his appointed positions to various branches of the city government. These positions gave him access to city funds and contractors, thereby controlling public works programs. This benefitted his pocketbook and those of his friends, but also provided jobs for the immigrants, especially Irish laborers, who were the electoral base of Tammany's power.Burrows & Wallace, p.837 and passim According to Tweed biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman: > It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring > at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically > deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the > treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an > elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and > organization.Ackerman, Kenneth D. Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the > Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York New York: Carroll & > Graf, 2005; quoted in Hammill, Pete, \\"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the > Ring\\" New York Times (March 27, 2005) Under \\"Boss\\" Tweed's dominance, the city expanded into the Upper East and Upper West Sides of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge was begun, land was set aside for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, orphanages and almshouses were constructed, and social services ‚Äì both directly provided by the state and indirectly funded by state appropriations to private charities ‚Äì expanded to unprecedented levels. All of this activity, of course, also brought great wealth to Tweed and his friends. It also brought them into contact and alliance with the rich elite of the city, who either fell in with the graft and corruption, or else tolerated it because of Tammany's ability to control the immigrant population, of whom the \\"uppertens\\" of the city were wary. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller Dick Connolly's office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff James O'Brien provided city accounts to O'Brien.Allen, pp. 118-125 Further, Tammany demonstrated inability to control Irish laborers in the Orange riot of 1871 that also began Tweed's downfall. Campaigns to topple Tweed by The New York Times and Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly began to gain traction in the aftermath of the riot, and disgruntled insiders began to leak the details of the extent and scope of the Tweed Ring's avarice to the newspapers. Specifically, O'Brien forwarded the city's financial accounts to The New York Times. The New York Times, at that time the only Republican associated paper in the city, was then able to reinforce stories they had previously published against the ring. The Committee of Seventy was formed in September 1871 by prominent reformers to examine the misdeeds of the Tweed ring. Tweed was arrested and tried in 1872. He died in Ludlow Street Jail, and political reformers took over the city and state governments. Following Tweed's arrest, Tammany survived but was no longer controlled just by Protestants and was now dependent on leadership from bosses of Irish descent. Puck cartoon by Frederick Burr Opper: \\"Lots of hunters after a very sick tiger\\" (1893) =1870‚Äì1900 = Tammany did not take long to rebound from Tweed's fall. Reforms demanded a general housecleaning, and former county sheriff \\"Honest John\\" Kelly was selected as the new leader. Kelly was not implicated in the Tweed scandals, and was a religious Catholic related by marriage to Archbishop John McCloskey. He cleared Tammany of Tweed's people, and tightened the Grand Sachem's control over the hierarchy. His success at revitalizing the machine was such that in the election of 1874, the Tammany candidate, William H. Wickham, unseated the unpopular reformist incumbent, William F. Havemeyer, and Democrats generally won their races, delivering control of the city back to Tammany Hall.Burrows & Wallace, p.1027 1886 mayoral election The mayoral election of 1886 was a seminal one for the organization. Union activists had founded the United Labor Party (ULP), which nominated political economist Henry George, the author of Progress and Poverty, as its standard- bearer. George was initially hesitant about running for office, but was convinced to do so after Tammany secretly offered him a seat in Congress if he would stay out of the mayoral race. Tammany had no expectation of George being elected, but knew that his candidacy and the new party were a direct threat to their own status as the putative champions of the working man.Burrows & Wallace, p.1099 Having inadvertently provoked George into running, Tammany now needed to field a strong candidate against him, which required the cooperation of the Catholic Church in New York, which was the key to getting the support of middle-class Irish-American voters. Richard Croker, Kelly's right-hand man, had succeeded Kelly as Grand Sachem of Tammany, and he understood that he would also need to make peace with the non-Tammany \\"Swallowtail\\" faction of the Democratic Party to avoid the threat that George and the ULP posed, which was the potential re-structuring of the city's politics along class lines and away from the ethnic-based politics which had been Tammany's underpinning all along. To bring together these disparate groups, Croker nominated Abram Hewitt as the Democratic candidate for mayor. Not only was Hewitt the leader of the Swallowtails, but he was noted philanthropist Peter Cooper's son-in-law, and had an impeccable reputation. To counter both George and Hewitt, the Republicans put up Theodore Roosevelt, the former state assemblyman.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1103‚Äì1106 Tammany Hall decorated for the 1868 Democratic National Convention In the end, Hewitt won the election, with George out-polling Roosevelt, whose total was some 2,000 votes less than the Republicans had normally received. Despite their second-place finish, things seemed bright for the future of the labor political movement, but the ULP was not to last, and was never able to bring about a new paradigm in the city's politics. Tammany had once again succeeded and survived. More than that, Croker realized that he could utilize the techniques of the well-organized election campaign that ULP had run. Because Tammany's ward-heelers controlled the saloons, the new party had used \\"neighborhood meetings, streetcorner rallies, campaign clubs, Assembly District organizations, and trade legions ‚Äì an entire political counterculture\\"Burrows & Wallace, p.1100 to run their campaign. Croker now took these innovations for Tammany's use, creating political clubhouses to take the place of the saloons and involving women and children by sponsoring family excursions and picnics. The New Tammany appeared to be more respectable, and less obviously connected to saloon-keepers and gang leaders, and the clubhouses, one in every Assembly District, were also a more efficient way of providing patronage work to those who came looking for it; one simply had to join the club, and volunteer to put in the hours needed to support it.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1106‚Äì1108 Hewitt turned out to be a terrible mayor for Croker, due to his personality defects and his nativist views, and in 1888 Tammany ran Croker's hand-picked choice, Hugh J. Grant, who became the first New York-born Irish-American mayor. Although Hewitt ran an efficient government, Croker viewed Hewitt as being too self-righteous and did not grant Croker the patronage jobs he was expecting from a mayor. Hewitt had also offended Irish voters by deciding not to review a St. Patrick's Day parade they requested of him.Allen p.175 Grant allowed Croker free run of the city's contracts and offices, creating a vast patronage machine beyond anything Tweed had ever dreamed of, a status which continued under Grant's successor, Thomas Francis Gilroy. With such resources of money and manpower ‚Äì the entire city workforce of 1,200 was essentially available to him when needed ‚Äì Croker was able to neutralize the Swallowtails permanently. He also developed a new stream of income from the business community, which was provided with \\"one stop shopping\\": instead of bribing individual office-holders, businesses, especially the utilities, could go directly to Tammany to make their payments, which were then directed downward as necessary; such was the control Tammany had come to have over the governmental apparatus of the city.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1108‚Äì1109 Croker mended fences with labor as well, pushing through legislation which addressed some of the inequities which had fueled the labor political movement, making Tammany once again appear to be the \\"Friend of the Working Man\\" ‚Äì although he was careful always to maintain a pro-business climate of laissez-faire and low taxes. Tammany's influence was also extended once again to the state legislature, where a similar patronage system to the city's was established after Tammany took control in 1892. With the Republican boss, Thomas Platt, adopting the same methods, the two men between them essentially controlled the state.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1109‚Äì1110 Fassett Committee The 1890s began with a series of what would be three political investigations into Tammany Operations, reminiscent of the early 1870s. Platt was the key organizer of most of these committees, the first of which was the Fassett Committee of 1890. This first committee featured testimony from Croker's brother-in-law, revealing gifts of cash surrounding his hotel business. The recorded testimonies resulted in no indictments and the Democrats would not suffer in the elections of 1890 or 1892. 1894 mayoral election and the Lexow Committee A bird's-eye-view map of New York and Brooklyn (1893), titled \\"A Cinch. Says Boss Croker to Boss McLaughlin: \\"Shake!\\" (The boss of Tammany Hall in New York, Richard Croker, and the boss of the Brooklyn political machine, Hugh McLaughlin, reach across the East River to shake hands in cooperation). In 1894, Tammany suffered a setback when, fueled by the public hearings on police corruption held by the Lexow Committee based on the evidence uncovered by the Rev. Charles Parkhurst when he explored the city's demi monde undercover, a Committee of Seventy was organized by Council of Good Government Clubs to break the stranglehold that Tammany had on the city. Full of some of the city's richest men ‚Äì J.P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Abram Hewitt and Elihu Root, among others ‚Äì the committee supported William L. Strong, a millionaire dry-goods merchant, for mayor, and forced Tammany's initial candidate, merchant Nathan Straus, co-owner of Macy's and Abraham & Straus, from the election by threatening to ostracize him from New York society. Tammany then put up Hugh Grant again, despite his being publicly dirtied by the police scandals. Backed by the committee's money, influence and their energetic campaign, and helped by Grant's apathy, Strong won the election handily, and spent the next three years running the city on the basis of \\"business principles\\", pledging an efficient government and the return of morality to city life. The election was a Republican sweep statewide: Levi Morton, a millionaire banker from Manhattan, won the governorship, and the party also ended up in control of the legislature.Burrows & Wallace, pp.1192‚Äì1194 Croker was absent from the city for three years starting at the onset of the Lexow Committee, residing in his homes in Europe. Still, Tammany could not be kept down for long, and in 1898 Croker, aided by the death of Henry George ‚Äì which took the wind out of the sails of the potential re-invigoration of the political labor movement ‚Äì and returned from his stay in Europe, shifted the Democratic Party enough to the left to pick up labor's support, and pulled back into the fold those elements outraged by the reformers' attempt to outlaw Sunday drinking and otherwise enforce their own authoritarian moral concepts on immigrant populations with different cultural outlooks. Tammany's candidate, Robert A. Van Wyck easily outpolled Seth Low, the reform candidate backed by the Citizens Union, and Tammany was back in control. Its supporters marched through the city's streets chanting, \\"Well, well, well, Reform has gone to Hell!\\"Burrows & Wallace, pp.1206‚Äì1208 All politics revolved around the Boss. 1899 cartoon from Puck. Mazet Investigation A final state investigation began in 1899 at the prompting of newly elected Theodore Roosevelt. This Mazet Investigation was chaired by Republican assemblyman Robert Mazet and led by chief counsel Frank Moss, who had also participated in the Lexow Committee. The investigation reveal further detail about Croker's corporate alliances and also yielded memorable quotes from police chief William Stephen Devery and Croker. This was also the committee that began probing Croker about his holdings in ice companies.Allen pp.197-200 Despite occasional defeats, Tammany was consistently able to survive and prosper. Under leaders such as Charles Francis Murphy and Timothy Sullivan, it maintained control of Democratic politics in the city and the state. =20th century=  Machine politics versus the reformers  The politics of the consolidated city from 1898 to 1945 revolved around conflicts between the political machines and the reformers. In quiet times the machines had the advantage of the core of solid supporters and usually exercised control of city and borough affairs; they also played a major role in the state legislature in Albany. Tammany for example from the 1880s onward built a strong network of local clubs that attracted ambitious middle-class ethnics.Martin Shefter, \\"The electoral foundations of the political machine: New York City, 1884‚Äì1897.\\" in Joel Silbey et al. eds., The history of American electoral behavior (1978) pp: 263‚Äì98, esp pp 294‚Äì95. In times of crisis however, especially in the severe depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s, the reformers took control of key offices, notably the mayor's office. The reformers were never unified; they operated through a complex network of independent civic reform groups, each focused its lobbying efforts on its own particular reform agenda. The membership included civic minded, well-educated middle-class men and women, usually with expert skills in a profession or business, who deeply distrusted the corruption of the machines.Richard Skolnik, \\"Civic Group Progressivism In New York City,\\" New York History (1970) 51#5 pp 411‚Äì439. Consolidation in 1898 multiplied the power of these reform groups, so long as they could agree on a common agenda, such as consolidation itself.David C. Hammack, Power and Society: Greater New York at the Turn of the Century (1982) pp 308‚Äì13 There was no citywide machine. Instead Democratic machines flourished in each of the boroughs, with Tammany Hall in Manhattan the most prominent. They typically had strong local organizations, known as \\"political clubs\\", as well as one prominent leader often called the \\"boss\\". Charles Murphy was the highly effective but quiet boss of Tammany Hall from 1902 to 1924. \\"Big Tim\\" Sullivan was the Tammany leader in the Bowery, and the machine's spokesman in the state legislature.Daniel Czitrom, \\"Underworlds and underdogs: Big Tim Sullivan and metropolitan politics in New York, 1889‚Äì1913,\\" Journal of American History (1991) 78#2 pp 536‚Äì558 in JSTOR Republican local organizations were much weaker, but they played key roles in forming reform coalitions. Most of the time they looked to Albany and Washington for their sphere of influence.Jackson, Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) pp 914, 999, 1149‚Äì51Marvin G. Weinbaum, \\"New York County Republican Politics, 1897‚Äì1922: The Quarter-Century After Municipal Consolidation.\\" New York Historical Society Quarterly (1966) 50#1 pp: 62‚Äì70. Seth Low, the president of Columbia University, was elected the reform mayor in 1901. He lacked the common touch, and lost much of his working class support when he listened to dry Protestants eager to crack down on the liquor business.\\"Seth Low,\\" in Jackson,Encyclopedia of New York City, (1996) p 695Steven C. Swett, \\"The Test of a Reformer: A Study of Seth Low, New York City Mayor, 1902‚Äì1903,\\" New-York Historical Society Quarterly (1960) 44#1 pp 5‚Äì41 From 1902 until his death in 1924, Charles Francis Murphy was Tammany's boss. Murphy wanted to clean up Tammany's image, and he sponsored progressive era reforms benefiting the working class through his two prot√©g√©s, Governor Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner. Ed Flynn, a prot√©g√© of Murphy who became the boss in the Bronx, said Murphy always advised that politicians should have nothing to do with gambling or prostitution, and should steer clear of involvement with the police department or the school system.Terry Golway, Machine Made: Tammany Hall and the Creation of Modern American Politics (2014) p 186 A new challenge to Tammany came from William Randolph Hearst, a powerful newspaper publisher who wanted to be president. Hearst was elected to Congress with Tammany support, was defeated for mayor after a bitter contest with Tammany, and won Tammany support for his unsuccessful quest for the governorship of New York. Hearst did manage to dominate Tammany mayor John F. Hylan (1917‚Äì25), but he lost control when Smith and Wagner denied Hylan renomination in 1925. Hearst then moved to California.Ben Proctor, William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863‚Äì1910 the parenthesis 1998) ch 11 Power vacuum and the Seabury Commission (1925‚Äì1932) After Charles Francis Murphy's death in 1924, Tammany's influence on Democratic politics began its wane. Murphy's successor as the Boss in 1924 was George W. Olvany, the first Tammany Hall Boss to have received a college education. When Tammany's Jimmy Walker became the city mayor over Hylan in 1925, the hall was poised for advantage. Olvany was not an overbearing Boss, and the familiar Tammany Hall schemes from a pre-Murphy era began. Police received protection money from shopkeepers, rackets surrounded the fish and poultry markets, as well as the docks, and licensing fees for various professions were increased with Tammany Hall middlemen reaping the benefits. This bright period of influence for Tammany Hall was short-lived. The population of Manhattan, Tammany's stronghold, no longer represented the population of the city as other boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx made gains. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as New York State Governor in 1928 further reduced Tammany Hall's power. Although Al Smith guided Roosevelt to the governorship, Roosevelt did not request Smith's advice once there and instead, appointed Bronx Boss Edward J. Flynn as New York's Secretary of State. The stock market crash of 1929 and the increasing press attention on organized crime during the Prohibition era also contributed to the hall's decline. Olvany resigned as the Boss in 1929, and John F. Curry was tapped to fill the role. Curry beat Eddy Ahearn for the role, Al Smith's choice and often considered to be an abler man. Although he looked the part, Curry was not considered smart enough to fill the role and proceeded to make a series of poor decisions on behalf of Tammany.Allen pp. 233-250 The organized crime robbery of a city judge and leader of the Tepecano Democratic Club, Albert H. Vitale, during a dinner party on December 7, 1929, and the subsequent recovering of the stolen goods from gangsters following a few calls from Magistrate Vitale, prompted the public to request a closer look at the ties of organized crime, law enforcement and the judicial system within the city. Vitale was accused of owing $19,600 to Arnold Rothstein, and was investigated by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for failing to explain how he accrued $165,000 over four years while receiving a total judicial salary of $48,000 during that same period. Vitale was removed from the bench. A further investigation by U.S. district attorney Charles H. Tuttle discovered that Brooklyn Judge Bernard Vause was paid $190,000 in return for obtaining pier leases for a shipping company, and that another city judge, George Ewald had paid Tammany Hall $10,000 for the replacement seat of Judge Vitale. FDR responded by launching three investigations between 1930 and 1932, headed by Samuel Seabury, called the Seabury Commission. Another Tammany Hall associate, state Supreme Court Justice Joseph Force Crater, disappeared in August 1930, after the start of the first investigation, in what would become an unsolved case. Crater was president of a Tammany Hall Club on the Upper West Side.Allen p.242 During questioning, Tammany associate and New York County Sheriff Thomas M. Farley denied that gambling took place in his political clubs and could not account for the frequent presence of associates of Arnold Rothstein. Other questioning focused on the combined police, court, and bail bonding scheme surrounding the improper arrest of prostitutes and innocent women. The outcome of these investigations included the dismissal of several corrupt judges, including the city's first female judge, Jean H. Norris, the resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker, the indictment of Deputy City Clerk James J. McCormick and the arrest of State Senator John A. Hastings. Sheriff Thomas M. Farley was removed from office by Governor Roosevelt. La Guardia in, Tammany out: 1933 to 1945 In 1932, the machine suffered a dual setback when mayor Jimmy Walker was forced from office by scandal and reform-minded Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president of the United States. Tammany Hall leader John F. Curry and Brooklyn political boss John H. McCooey had joined forces to support Al Smith's candidacy. Roosevelt and his lead campaign manager James Farley stripped Tammany of federal patronage, which had been expanded under the New Deal‚Äîand passed it instead to Ed Flynn, boss of the Bronx who had kept his district clean of corruption.\\"Edward Flynn (1891‚Äì1953)\\" George Washington University website Roosevelt helped Republican Fiorello La Guardia become mayor on a Fusion ticket, thus removing even more patronage from Tammany's control. La Guardia was elected in 1933. After becoming mayor, LaGuardia reorganized the city cabinet with non-partisan officials and sought to develop a clean and honest city government. Tammany alderman Alford J. Williams died in December 1933; when the Board of Aldermen reconvened in January 1934 it defied party leadership and elected an ally of La Guardia as his successor. The shock from this decision caused Tammany Bronx leader Augustus Pierce to collapse and die of a heart attack in the aldermanic chambers. As mayor, LaGuardia successfully led the effort to have a new city charter adopted which would mandate a proportional representation method of electing members of the City Council. The measure won on a referendum in 1936. After the new charter went into effect in 1938, the ward system which had allowed only a small number of people to serve on the City Council since 1686 ceased to exist, and the new 26-member New York City Council now had certain functions governed by the Board of Estimate.New York City Council website La Guardia's appointees filled the board of magistrates and virtually every other long-term appointive office, and the power of Tammany Hall had now been reduced to a shadow of what it once was. LaGuardia also greatly increased the number of city jobs awarded by the civil service system: about half of city positions required job seekers to take an exam in 1933, compared to about three-quarters in 1939.Allen p. 256 In 1937, LaGuardia became the first anti-Tammany \\"reform\\" Mayor to ever be re- elected in the city's history and was again re-elected in 1941 before retiring in 1945. His extended tenure weakened Tammany in a way that previous reform mayors had not. Tammany depended for its power on government contracts, jobs, patronage, corruption, and ultimately the ability of its leaders to control nominations to the Democratic ticket and swing the popular vote. The last element weakened after 1940 with the decline of relief programs like WPA and CCC that Tammany used to gain and hold supporters. Congressman Christopher \\"Christy\\" Sullivan was one of the last \\"bosses\\" of Tammany Hall before its collapse. Criminal issues Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey also got longtime Tammany Hall boss Jimmy Hines convicted of bribery in 1939 and sentenced to 4‚Äì8 years.Hines, James J. Newspaper Clippings from the Trials, 1938‚Äì1940: Finding Aid Harvard Law School Library website The loss of Hines would serve as a major blow to Tammany, as he had given the political machine strong ties to the city's powerful organized crime figures since the 1920s. A few years prior, Dewey also had powerful mobster and strong Tammany ally Lucky Luciano convicted of racketeering and sentenced to 30‚Äì50 years; however, Luciano was still able to maintain control of the powerful Luciano crime family from prison until his sentence was commuted to deportation to Italy in 1946. Several Tammany Hall officials affiliated with Hines and Luciano were also successfully prosecuted by Dewey. In 1943, district attorney Frank Hogan provided a transcript of a recorded phone message between Frank Costello and Judge Thomas A. Aurelio, a Tammany associate running for state Supreme Court on both Republican and Democrat tickets, wherein Aurelio pledged his loyalty to Costello.Allen p. 258 Indian Summer, 1950s Although the Kefauver hearings, an investigation into organized crime, did not directly impact Tammany, it did not help its image regarding its appeared connection to organized crime.Allen p. 271 Tammany never recovered from prosecutions of the 1940s, but it staged a small-scale comeback in the early 1950s under the leadership of Carmine DeSapio, who succeeded in engineering the elections of Robert F. Wagner, Jr., an outspoken liberal Democrat, as mayor in 1953 and W. Averell Harriman as state governor in 1954, while simultaneously blocking his enemies, especially Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. in the 1954 race for state Attorney General. Unlike previous Tammany bosses, however, DeSapio had promoted himself as a reformer and always made his decisions known to the public. The fact that DeSapio was of Italian descent also demonstrated that Tammany was no longer dominated by Irish-American politicians. Under DeSapio's leadership, the nationality of Tammany Hall's leaders diversified. However, DeSapio's close ties with the city's lead mobster Frank Costello, Luciano's self-appointed successor, helped establish him as a corrupt figure. During DeSapio's reign, Costello was the main person who influenced the decisions made by Tammany Hall officials. By 1956, however, Costello, who was convicted of tax evasion in 1954 and now controlled the Luciano family from prison, was engaged in a major power struggle with fellow associate Vito Genovese and his grip on power greatly weakened. In 1957, Costello was released from prison after winning an appeal but officially abandoned his role as head of the Luciano family following a failed assassination attempt. In 1958, DeSapio's \\"reform\\" image was severely damaged after he ran his own candidate for the Senate, Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan. New Yorkers now saw DeSapio as an old-time Tammany Hall boss, and Hogan would lose the Senate election to Republican Kenneth Keating; Republican Nelson Rockefeller would also be elected Governor the same year. Democrats who once praised De Sapio now excoriated him. In 1961, Wagner won re-election by running a reformist campaign that denounced his former patron, DeSapio, as an undemocratic practitioner of Tammany machine politics. After World War II, a group of young World War II veterans and other reform-minded Democrats began the Lexington Democratic Club in response to being denied access to Tammany Hall politics by the old guard.Allen p.275 Eleanor Roosevelt organized a counterattack with Herbert H. Lehman and Thomas K. Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to fighting Tammany. In 1961, the group helped remove DeSapio from power. The once mighty Tammany political machine, now deprived of its leadership, quickly faded from political importance, and by 1967 it ceased to exist; its demise as the controlling group of the New York Democratic Party was sealed when the Village Independent Democrats under Ed Koch wrested away control of the Manhattan party. Leaders There were two distinct entities: the Tammany Society, headed by a Grand Sachem elected annually on May 23; and the Tammany Hall political machine headed by a \\"boss\\". The following list names the political bosses, as far as could be ascertained.

Raymond Jones Headquarters 170 Nassau Street in 1893 East 14th Street between Third Avenue and Irving Place in Manhattan, New York City (1914). The building was demolished c.1927. 44 Union Square, the former Tammany Hall building at 17th Street and Park Avenue South, across from Union Square, housed a theatre and a film school until renovations commenced in 2016. =Early years= In its very early days, the Tammany Society met in the back rooms of various taverns, most often in Barden's Tavern on Broadway near Bowling Green.Allen, pp.7‚Äì8 These back rooms served as unofficial campaign headquarters on election days.Burrows & Wallace p.322 In 1791, the society opened a museum designed to collect artifacts relating to the events and history of the United States. Originally presented in an upper room of City Hall, it moved to the Merchant's Exchange when that proved to be too small. The museum was unsuccessful, and the Society severed its connections with it in 1795.Burrows & Wallace p.316 Then, in 1798, the Society moved to more permanent and spacious quarters, the \\"Long Room\\" of \\"Brom\\" Martling's Tavern, at Nassau Street and Spruce Street, near where City Hall is today. Tammany controlled the space, which it dubbed \\"The Wigwam\\", and let other responsible political organizations it approved of use the room for meetings. This space became commonly known as \\"Tammany Hall\\". Their new headquarters had limitations as well as advantages, and in 1812 Tammany moved again, this time to a new five-story $55,000 building it built at the corner of Nassau and Frankfort Streets, just a few blocks away. The new Tammany Hall had a large room that could accommodate up to 2,000 people for political and social events, and the rest of the building was run as a hotel. The Society was to remain there for 55 years.Allen, p.24 =14th Street headquarters= By the 1860s, Tammany under Tweed had much greater influence - and affluence, so new headquarters was deemed desirable. The cornerstone for the new Tammany headquarters was laid on July 14, 1867, at 141 East 14th Street between Third Avenue and Fourth Avenue (the building at Nassau and Frankfort was sold to Charles Dana and his friends, who bought a newspaper, The Sun, and moved it thereO'Brien, Frank Michael. The Story of the Sun: New York, 1833‚Äì1918 George H. Doran Co, 1916. p. 229). When the leaders of the Society found that they had not raised enough funds, and needed $25,000 more, a meeting was held at which $175,000 was immediately pledged.Allen, pp.99‚Äì100 The new Wigwam was completed in 1868. It was not just a political clubhouse: > Tammany Hall merged politics and entertainment, already stylistically > similar, in its new headquarters. ... The Tammany Society kept only one room > for itself, renting the rest to entertainment impresarios: Don Bryant's > Minstrels, a German theater company, classical concerts and opera. The > basement ‚Äì in the French mode ‚Äì offered the Caf√© Ausant, where one could see > tableaux vivant, gymnastic exhibitions, pantomimes, and Punch and Judy > shows. There was also a bar, a bazaar, a Ladies' Cafe, and an oyster saloon. > All this ‚Äì with the exception of Bryant's ‚Äì was open from seven till > midnight for a combination price of fifty cents.Burrows & Wallace p.995 The building had an auditorium big enough to hold public meetings, and a smaller one that became Tony Pastor's Music Hall, where vaudeville had its beginnings.Wurman, Richard Saul.

The structure was topped off by a large-than-life statue of Saint Tammany. =44 Union Square= In 1927 the building on 14th Street was sold, to make way for the new tower being added to the Consolidated Edison Building. The Society's new building at 44 Union Square, a few blocks north at the corner with East 17th Street, was finished and occupied by 1929. When Tammany started to lose its political influence, and its all-important access to graft, it could no longer afford to maintain the 17th Street building, and in 1943 it was bought by a local affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Tammany left, and its leaders moved to the National Democratic Club on Madison Avenue at East 37th Street, and the Society's collection of memorabilia went into a warehouse in the Bronx.Allen, p.259 The building at 44 Union Square housed the New York Film Academy and the Union Square Theatre, and retail stores at street level, until a complete renovation of the building began in January 2016. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated it in October 2013.Tammany Hall a Landmark New York Daily News Plans to add a glass dome to the building were nixed by the Landmarks Commission in 2014; however, the interior is still slated to be completely rebuilt, including demolishing the theater. In 2015, a scaled-back version of the glass dome was approved by the commission. In popular culture *The 1959 Broadway musical Fiorello! describes Fiorello H.

Whitewater is formed in a rapid, when a river's gradient changes enough to generate so much turbulence that air is trapped within the water. This forms an unstable current that froths, making the water appear opaque and white. The term \\"whitewater\\" also has a broader meaning, applying to any river or creek that has a significant number of rapids. The term is also used as an adjective describing boating on such rivers, such as whitewater canoeing or whitewater kayaking. Fast rivers Four factors, separately or in combination, can create rapids: gradient, constriction, obstruction, and flow rate. Gradient, constriction, and obstruction are streambed topography factors and are relatively consistent. Flow rate is dependent upon both seasonal variation in precipitation and snowmelt and upon release rates of upstream dams. =Streambed topography= Streambed topography is the primary factor in creating rapids, and is generally consistent over time. Increased flow, as during a flood or high-rainfall season, can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders, by deposition of alluvium, or by creating new channels for flowing water. Gradient The gradient of a river is the rate at which it changes elevation along its course. This loss determines the river's slope, and to a large extent its rate of flow (velocity). Shallow gradients produce gentle, slow rivers, while steep gradients are associated with raging torrents. Constriction Constrictions can form a rapid when a river's flow is forced into a narrower channel. This pressure causes the water to flow more rapidly and to react to riverbed events (rocks, drops, etc.). Obstruction A boulder or ledge in the middle of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river, and can also create a \\"pillow\\"; when water flows backwards upstream of the obstruction, or a \\"pour over\\" (over the boulder); and \\"hydraulics\\" or \\"holes\\" where the river flows back on itself‚Äîperhaps back under the drop‚Äîoften with fearful results for those caught in its grasp. (Holes, or hydraulics, are so- called because their foamy, aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface.) If the flow passes next to the obstruction, an eddy may form behind the obstruction; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest, scout, or leave the main current, they may be swirling and whirlpool-like. As with hydraulics (which pull downward rather than to the side and are essentially eddies turned at a 90¬∞ angle), the power of eddies increases with the flow rate. In large rivers with high flow rates next to an obstruction, \\"eddy walls\\" can occur. An eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction. This can make it difficult for a boater, who has stopped in that particular eddy, to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow. =Stream flow rate= A marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid, \\"wash out\\" a rapid (decreasing the hazard), or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible. Flow rate is measured in volume per unit of time.  Classification  The most widely used grading system is the International Scale of River Difficulty, where whitewater (either an individual rapid, or the entire river) is classed in six categories from class I (the easiest and safest) to class VI (the most difficult and most dangerous). The grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid, with grade I referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards, and grade VI referring to the hardest rapids, which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers, and are rarely run. Grade-VI rapids are sometimes downgraded to grade-V or V+ if they have been run successfully. Harder rapids (for example a grade-V rapid on a mainly grade-III river) are often portaged, a French term for carrying. A portaged rapid is where the boater lands and carries the boat around the hazard. A rapid's grade is not fixed, since it may vary greatly depending on the water depth and speed of flow. Also, the level of development in rafting/kayaking technology plays a role. Rapids that would have meant almost certain death a hundred years ago may now be considered only a Class IV or V rapid, due to the development of certain safety features. Although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or \\"washed-out\\", high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous. At flood stage, even rapids that are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards (briefly adapted from the American version of the International Scale of River Difficulty). * Class 1: Very small rough areas, requires no maneuvering (skill level: none) * Class 2: Some rough water, maybe some rocks, small drops, might require maneuvering (skill level: basic paddling) * Class 3: Medium waves, maybe a 3‚Äì5 ft drop, but not much considerable danger, may require significant maneuvering (skill level: experienced paddling) * Class 4: Whitewater, large waves, long rapids, rocks, maybe a considerable drop, sharp maneuvers may be needed (skill level: advanced whitewater experience) * Class 5: Whitewater, large waves, continuous rapids, large rocks and hazards, maybe a large drop, precise maneuvering, often characterized by \\"must make\\" moves, i.e. failure to execute a specific maneuver at a specific point may result in serious injury or death, class 5 sometimes expanded to Class 5+ that describes the most extreme, runnable rapids (skill level: expert) * Class 6: While some debate exists over the term \\"class 6\\", in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury, near drowning, or death (e.g. Murchison Falls). If a rapid is run that was once thought to be impassible, it is typically reclassified as class 5.  Features found in whitewater  On any given rapid, a multitude of different features can arise from the interplay between the shape of the riverbed and the velocity of the water in the stream. = Strainers or sifts = Strainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects, but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander. These objects can be very dangerous, because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up, pushing it down under water. For a person caught in this position, getting to safety will be difficult or impossible, often leading to a fatal outcome. Strainers are formed by many natural or man-made objects, such as storm grates over tunnels, trees that have fallen into a river (\\"log jam\\"), bushes by the side of the river that are flooded during high water, wire fence, rebar from broken concrete structures in the water, or other debris. Strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore, exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers. In an emergency, climbing on top of a strainer may be better so as not to be pinned against the object under the water. In a river, swimming aggressively away from the strainer and into the main channel is recommended. If avoiding the strainer is not possible, one should swim hard towards it and try to get as much of one's body up and over it as possible. = Sweepers = Sweepers are trees fallen in or heavily leaning over the river, still rooted on the shore and not fully submerged. Their trunks and branches may form an obstruction in the river like strainers. Since it is an obstruction from above, it often does not contribute to whitewater features, but may create turbulence. In fast water, sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers. = Holes = Holes, or \\"hydraulics\\", (also known as \\"stoppers\\" or \\"souse-holes\\" (see also Pillows) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object, or underwater ledges, causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object. Holes can be particularly dangerous‚Äîa boater may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water‚Äîor entertaining play-spots, where paddlers use the holes' features to perform various playboating moves. In high- and low-volume water flows, holes can subtly aerate the water, enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole'. Some of the most dangerous types of holes are formed by low-head dams (weirs), and similar types of obstructions. In a low-head dam, the 'hole' has a very wide, uniform structure with no escape point, and the sides of the hydraulic (ends of the dam) are often blocked by a man-made wall, making paddling around, or slipping off, the side of the hydraulic, where the bypass water flow would become normal (laminar), difficult. By (upside-down) analogy, this would be much like a surfer slipping out the end of the pipeline, where the wave no longer breaks. Low-head dams are insidiously dangerous because their danger cannot be easily recognized by people who have not studied swift water. (Even 'experts' have died in them.) Floating debris (trees, kayaks, etc.) is often trapped in these retroflow 'grinders' for weeks at a time.NFPA-1006 Standard for Technical Rescuer = Waves = Waves are formed in a similar manner to hydraulics and are sometimes also considered hydraulics, as well. Waves are noted by the large, smooth face on the water rushing down. Sometimes, a particularly large wave also is followed by a \\"wave train\\", a long series of waves. These standing waves can be smooth, or particularly the larger ones, can be breaking waves (also called \\"whitecaps\\" or \\"haystacks\\"). Because of the rough and random pattern of a riverbed, waves are often not perpendicular to the river's current. This makes them challenging for boaters, since a strong sideways or diagonal (also called a \\"lateral\\") wave can throw the craft off if the craft hits sideways or at an angle. The safest move for a whitewater boater approaching a lateral is to \\"square up\\" or turn the boat such that it hits the wave along the boat's longest axis, reducing the chance of the boat flipping or capsizing. This is often counterintuitive because it requires turning the boat such that it is no longer parallel to the current. In fluid mechanics, waves are classified as laminar, but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence (\\"breaking waves\\") under the general heading of waves. = Pillows = Pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction, causing water to \\"pile up\\" or \\"boil\\" against the face of the obstruction. Pillows normally signal that a rock is not undercut. Pillows are also known as \\"pressure waves\\". = Eddies = Eddies are formed, like hydraulics, on the downstream face of an obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, eddies swirl on the horizontal surface of the water. Typically, they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested‚Äîa place to rest or to make one's way upstream. However, in very powerful water, eddies can have powerful, swirling currents that can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult. = Undercut rocks = Undercut rocks have been worn down underneath the surface by the river, or are loose boulders which cantilever out beyond their resting spots on the riverbed. They can be extremely dangerous features of a rapid because a person can get trapped underneath them under water. This is especially true of rocks that are undercut on the upstream side. Here, a boater may become pinned against the rock under water. Many whitewater deaths have occurred in this fashion. Undercuts sometimes have pillows, but other times the water just flows smoothly under them, which can indicate that the rock is undercut. Undercuts are most common in rivers where the riverbed cuts through sedimentary rocks such as limestone rather than igneous rock such as granite. In a steep canyon, the side walls of the canyon can also be undercut. A particularly notorious undercut rock is Dimple Rock, in Dimple Rapid on the Lower Youghiogheny River, a very popular rafting and kayaking river in Pennsylvania. Of about nine people who have died at or near Dimple Rock, including three in 2000, several of the deaths were the result of people becoming entrapped after they were swept under the rock. = Sieves = Another major whitewater feature is a sieve, which is a narrow, empty space through which water flows between two obstructions, usually rocks. Similar to strainers, water is forced through the sieve, resulting in higher velocity flow, which forces water up and creates turbulence.  Whitewater craft  A solo kayak paddler performs a 'high brace' in foamy water. One of the hazards of whitewater paddling is that highly aerated water decreases the effect of buoyancy. People use many types of whitewater craft to make their way down a rapid, preferably with finesse and control. Here is a short list of them: Whitewater kayaks differ from sea kayaks and recreational kayaks in that they are better specialized to deal with moving water. They are often shorter and more maneuverable than sea kayaks and are specially designed to deal with water flowing up onto their decks. Most whitewater kayaks are made of plastics now, although some paddlers (especially racers and \\"squirt boaters\\") use kayaks made of fiberglass composites. Whitewater kayaks are fairly stable in turbulent water, once the paddler is skillful with them; if flipped upside-down, the skilled paddler can easily roll them back upright. This essential skill of whitewater kayaking is called the \\"Eskimo roll\\", or simply \\"roll\\". Kayaks are paddled in a low sitting position (legs extended forward), with a two-bladed paddle. See Whitewater kayaking. Rafts are also often used as a whitewater craft; more stable than typical kayaks, they are less maneuverable. Rafts can carry large loads, so they are often used for expeditions. Typical whitewater rafts are inflatable craft, made from high-strength fabric coated with PVC, urethane, neoprene or Hypalon; see rafting. While most rafts are large multipassenger craft, the smallest rafts are single-person whitewater craft, see packraft. Rafts sometimes have inflatable floors, with holes around the edges, that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom (these are typically called \\"self-bailers\\" because the occupants do not have to \\"bail\\" water out with a bucket). Others have simple fabric floors, without anyway for water to escape, these are called \\"bucket boats\\", both for their tendency to hold water like a bucket, and because the only way to get water out of them is by bailing with a bucket. Catarafts are constructed from the same materials as rafts. They can either be paddled or rowed with oars. Typical catarafts are constructed from two inflatable pontoons on either side of the craft that are bridged by a frame. Oar-propelled catarafts have the occupants sitting on seats mounted on the frame. Virtually all oar-powered catarafts are operated by a boatsman with passengers having no direct responsibilities. Catarafts can be of all sizes; many are smaller and more maneuverable than a typical raft. Modern Whitewater Canoe Canoes are often made of fiberglass, kevlar, plastic, or a combination of the three for strength and durability. They may have a spraycover, resembling a kayak, or be \\"open\\", resembling the typical canoe. This type of canoe is usually referred to simply as an \\"open boat\\". Whitewater canoes are paddled in a low kneeling position, with a one-bladed paddle. Open whitewater canoes often have large airbags and in some cases foam, usually 2-lb density ethyl foam, firmly attached to the sides, to displace water in the boat when swamped by big waves and holes and to allow water to be spilled from the boat while still in the river by floating it up on its side using the foam and bags. Like kayaks, whitewater canoes can be righted after capsizing with an Eskimo roll, but this requires more skill in a canoe. C1s are similar in construction to whitewater kayaks, but they are paddled in a low, kneeling position. They employ the use of a one-blade paddle, usually a little shorter than used in a more traditional canoe. They have a spraycover, essentially the same type used in kayaking. Like kayaks, C1s can be righted after capsizing with an Eskimo roll. McKenzie River dory (or \\"drift boat\\" by some) is a more traditional \\"hard sided\\" boat. The design is characterized by a wide, flat bottom, flared sides, a narrow, flat bow, a pointed stern, and extreme rocker in the bow and stern to allow the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids. River bugs are small, single-person, inflatable craft where a person's feet stick out of one end. River bugging is done feet first with no paddle.  Safety  Running whitewater rivers is a popular recreational sport, but is not without danger. Fast-moving water always has the potential for injury or death by drowning or hitting objects. Fatalities do occur; some 50 people die in whitewater accidents in the United States each year. The dangers can be mitigated (but not eliminated) by training, experience, scouting, the use of safety equipment (such as personal flotation devices, helmets, throw ropes), and using other persons as \\"spotters\\". Scouting or examining the rapids before running them is crucial to familiarize oneself with the stream and anticipate the challenges. This is especially important during flood conditions when the highly increased flows have altered the normal conditions drastically.

Types The traditional Maltese balcony is a wooden closed balcony projecting from a wall. By contrast, a 'Juliet balcony' does not protrude out of the building. It is usually part of an upper floor, with a balustrade only at the front, like a small Loggia. Modern Juliet balconies often involve a metal barrier placed in front of a high window which can be opened. Juliet balconies are named after Shakespeare's Juliet, who, in traditional stagings of the play Romeo and Juliet, is courted by Romeo while she is on her balcony‚Äîthough the play itself, as written, makes no mention of a balcony, but only of a window at which Juliet appears. Various types of balcony have been used in depicting this famous scene; however the 'balcony of Juliet' at Villa Capuleti in Verona is not a 'Juliet balcony', as it does indeed protrude from the wall of the villa (see photograph below). The Julian Balcony is a slightly larger version of the well-known Juliet Balcony, protruding slightly from the wall, unlike the smaller Juliet balcony, and spanning at least two windows rather than one. Functions Sometimes balconies are adapted for ceremonial purposes, e.g. that of St. Peter's Basilica at Rome, when the newly elected pope gives his blessing urbi et orbi after the conclave. Inside churches, balconies are sometimes provided for the singers, and in banqueting halls and the like for the musicians. A unit with a regular balcony will have doors that open up onto a small patio with railings, a small Patio garden or Skyrise greenery. A French balcony is actually a false balcony, with doors that open to a railing with a view of the courtyard or the surrounding scenery below. In theatres, the balcony was formerly a stage-box, but the name is now usually confined to the part of the auditorium above the dress circle and below the gallery. Balconies are part of the sculptural shape of the building allowing for irregular facades without the cost of irregular internal structures. Notable balconies One of the most famous uses of a balcony is in traditional stagings of the scene that has come to be known as the \\"balcony scene\\" in William Shakespeare's tragedy, Romeo and Juliet (though the scene makes no mention of a balcony, only of a window at which Juliet appears).

The berries of those in the genus Ribes (sometimes placed in the genus Grossularia) are edible and may be green, red, purple, yellow, white, or black. Gooseberry species Species in the genus Ribes known as gooseberry include: Missouri gooseberry, Ribes missouriense Santa Cruz Island gooseberry, Ribes thacherianum Other plants known as gooseberry include: * Byrsonima lucida * Ceylon gooseberry, a species of Dovyalis native to Sri Lanka and southern India * Chinese gooseberry, or kiwifruit, the edible berry of a cultivar group of the woody vine Actinidia deliciosa and hybrids between this and other species in the genus Actinidia * Curio herreanus, a succulent plant in the aster family that superficially bears resemblance to gooseberry * Pereskia aculeata, Barbados gooseberry, an unusual cactus * Family Phyllanthaceae: *Phyllanthus emblica, Indian gooseberry, emblic ** Jamaican gooseberry tree, a herb-like plant of the family Phyllanthaceae ** Otaheite gooseberry, the only tree with edible fruit in the family Phyllanthaceae ** Star gooseberry **Phyllanthus acidus **Sauropus androgynus, a shrub grown in some tropical regions as a leaf vegetable * In the family Solanaceae: *Physalis angulata, also called balloon cherry, and cutleaf groundcherry *Physalis peruviana, Cape gooseberry, indigenous to South America and South Africa * Withania somnifera, Poison gooseberry Etymology The \\"goose\\" in \\"gooseberry\\" has usually been seen as a corruption of either the Dutch word kruisbes or the allied German Krausbeere, or of the earlier forms of the French groseille. Alternatively, the word has been connected to the Middle High German krus (curl, crisped), in Latin as grossularia. However, the Oxford English Dictionary takes the obvious derivation from goose and berry as probable because \\"the grounds on which plants and fruits have received names associating them with animals are so often inexplicable that the inappropriateness in the meaning does not necessarily give good grounds for believing that the word is an etymological corruption\\". The French for gooseberry is groseille √† maquereau, translated as \\"mackerel berries\\", due to their use in a sauce for mackerel in old French cuisine. In Britain, gooseberries may informally be called goosegogs. \\"Gooseberry bush\\" was 19th-century slang for pubic hair, and from this comes the saying that babies are \\"born under a gooseberry bush\\". In history Gooseberry growing was popular in the 19th century, as described in 1879: > The gooseberry is indigenous to many parts of Europe and western Asia, > growing naturally in alpine thickets and rocky woods in the lower country, > from France eastward, well into the Himalayas and peninsular India. In > Britain, it is often found in copses and hedgerows and about old ruins, but > the gooseberry has been cultivated for so long that it is difficult to > distinguish wild bushes from feral ones, or to determine where the > gooseberry fits into the native flora of the island.

Cultivation Sectioned gooseberries showing seeds A blossom of Ribes uva- crispa One method of propagating gooseberries of the genus Ribes is by cuttings rather than raising from seed; cuttings planted in the autumn will take root quickly and can begin to bear fruit within a few years. Those growing from seeds will rapidly produce healthy heavily yielding bushes. Pruning should be carried out to allow light in and give the new growth for next year's branches an opportunity to grow. Fruit is produced on lateral spurs and on the previous year's shoots. The main aim is to let the light in and a subsidiary purpose is to allow picking without excessive scratching from the spines. Heavy nitrogen composting must be avoided as too much nitrogen will produce extensive growth and weaken the bush. This will make the bush susceptible to mildew. The fruit should best be picked off when large to reach maximum sweetness. Supermarkets tend to have theirs picked early and before they are ripe and sweet to give a long shelf life. Heavily laden branches should be cut off complete with berries, this really benefits future crops as it lets the light reach the new growth. Thom√©, Otto Wilhelm (1885). Flora von Deutschland, √ñsterreich und der Schweiz. =Cultivars= Numerous cultivars have been developed for both commercial and domestic use. The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\\\\- *Ribes 'Careless' *Ribes 'Greenfinch' *Ribes 'Invicta' *Ribes 'Leveller' *Ribes 'Whinham's Industry' The cultivar 'Invicta' is a popular green gooseberry which has some mildew resistance. Insect habitat Gooseberry bushes (Ribes) are hosts to magpie moth (Abraxas grossulariata) caterpillars. Gooseberry plants are also a preferred host plant for comma butterfly (Polygonia c-album), whose larvae frequently feed upon the plant during the development stage, v-moth (Macaria wauaria), and gooseberry sawfly (Nematus ribesii). Nematus ribesii grubs will bury themselves in the ground to pupate; on hatching into adult form, they lay their eggs, which hatch into larvae on the underside of gooseberry leaves. Nutrition Raw gooseberries are 88% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein and 0.6% fat (table). In a 100-gram reference amount, gooseberries provide 44 calories and are a rich source of vitamin C (33% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table). Culinary uses Gooseberries are edible and can be eaten as-is, or used as an ingredient in desserts, such as pies, fools and crumbles. Early pickings are generally sour and more appropriate for culinary use. They are also used to flavour beverages such as sodas, flavoured waters, or milk, and can be made into fruit wines and teas. Gooseberries can be preserved in the form of jams, dried fruit, or as the primary or a secondary ingredient in pickling, or stored in sugar syrup.

Camera on tripod is pointing down at a light table to produce backlit image shown on screen, which is then subjected to blob extraction. Machine vision (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision refers to many technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of computer science. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance. The overall machine vision process includes planning the details of the requirements and project, and then creating a solution. During run-time, the process starts with imaging, followed by automated analysis of the image and extraction of the required information. Definition Definitions of the term \\"Machine vision\\" vary, but all include the technology and methods used to extract information from an image on an automated basis, as opposed to image processing, where the output is another image. The information extracted can be a simple good- part/bad-part signal, or more a complex set of data such as the identity, position and orientation of each object in an image. The information can be used for such applications as automatic inspection and robot and process guidance in industry, for security monitoring and vehicle guidance. This field encompasses a large number of technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision is practically the only term used for these functions in industrial automation applications; the term is less universal for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of basic computer science; machine vision attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems in a way that meets the requirements of industrial automation and similar application areas. The term is also used in a broader sense by trade shows and trade groups such as the Automated Imaging Association and the European Machine Vision Association. This broader definition also encompasses products and applications most often associated with image processing. The primary uses for machine vision are automatic inspection and industrial robot/process guidance. See glossary of machine vision. Imaging based automatic inspection and sorting The primary uses for machine vision are imaging-based automatic inspection and sorting and robot guidance.; in this section the former is abbreviated as \\"automatic inspection\\". The overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project, and then creating a solution. This section describes the technical process that occurs during the operation of the solution. =Methods and sequence of operation= The first step in the automatic inspection sequence of operation is acquisition of an image, typically using cameras, lenses, and lighting that has been designed to provide the differentiation required by subsequent processing. MV software packages and programs developed in them then employ various digital image processing techniques to extract the required information, and often make decisions (such as pass/fail) based on the extracted information. =Equipment= The components of an automatic inspection system usually include lighting, a camera or other imager, a processor, software, and output devices. =Imaging= The imaging device (e.g. camera) can either be separate from the main image processing unit or combined with it in which case the combination is generally called a smart camera or smart sensor. Inclusion of the full processing function into the same enclosure as the camera is often referred to as embedded processing.Critical Considerations for Embedded Vision Design by Dave Rice and Amber Thousand Photonics Spectra magazine published by Laurin Publishing Co. July 2019 issue Pages 60-64 When separated, the connection may be made to specialized intermediate hardware, a custom processing appliance, or a frame grabber within a computer using either an analog or standardized digital interface (Camera Link, CoaXPress). MV implementations also use digital cameras capable of direct connections (without a framegrabber) to a computer via FireWire, USB or Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. While conventional (2D visible light) imaging is most commonly used in MV, alternatives include multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging, imaging various infrared bands, line scan imaging, 3D imaging of surfaces and X-ray imaging. Key differentiations within MV 2D visible light imaging are monochromatic vs. color, frame rate, resolution, and whether or not the imaging process is simultaneous over the entire image, making it suitable for moving processes.West, Perry High Speed, Real-Time Machine Vision CyberOptics, pages 1-38 Though the vast majority of machine vision applications are solved using two-dimensional imaging, machine vision applications utilizing 3D imaging are a growing niche within the industry. The most commonly used method for 3D imaging is scanning based triangulation which utilizes motion of the product or image during the imaging process. A laser is projected onto the surfaces of an object. In machine vision this is accomplished with a scanning motion, either by moving the workpiece, or by moving the camera & laser imaging system. The line is viewed by a camera from a different angle; the deviation of the line represents shape variations. Lines from multiple scans are assembled into a depth map or point cloud. Stereoscopic vision is used in special cases involving unique features present in both views of a pair of cameras.3-D Imaging: A practical Overview for Machine Vision By Fred Turek & Kim Jackson Quality Magazine, March 2014 issue, Volume 53/Number 3 Pages 6-8 Other 3D methods used for machine vision are time of flight and grid based. One method is grid array based systems using pseudorandom structured light system as employed by the Microsoft Kinect system circa 2012.http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/fengwu/depth-icip-12.pdf HYBRID STRUCTURED LIGHT FOR SCALABLE DEPTH SENSING Yueyi Zhang, Zhiwei Xiong, Feng Wu University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, ChinaR.Morano, C.Ozturk, R.Conn, S.Dubin, S.Zietz, J.Nissano, \\"Structured light using pseudorandom codes\\", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 20 (3)(1998)322‚Äì327 =Image processing= After an image is acquired, it is processed.. Central processing functions are generally done by a CPU, a GPU, a FPGA or a combination of these. Deep learning training and inference impose higher processing performance requirements.Finding the optimal hardware for deep learining inference in machine vision by Mike Fussell Vision Systems Design magazine September 2019 issue pages 8-9 Multiple stages of processing are generally used in a sequence that ends up as a desired result. A typical sequence might start with tools such as filters which modify the image, followed by extraction of objects, then extraction (e.g. measurements, reading of codes) of data from those objects, followed by communicating that data, or comparing it against target values to create and communicate \\"pass/fail\\" results. Machine vision image processing methods include; * Stitching/Registration: Combining of adjacent 2D or 3D images. * Filtering (e.g. morphological filtering) * Thresholding: Thresholding starts with setting or determining a gray value that will be useful for the following steps. The value is then used to separate portions of the image, and sometimes to transform each portion of the image to simply black and white based on whether it is below or above that grayscale value. * Pixel counting: counts the number of light or dark pixels * Segmentation: Partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.Linda G. Shapiro and George C. Stockman (2001): ‚ÄúComputer Vision‚Äù, pp 279-325, New Jersey, Prentice-Hall, Lauren Barghout. Visual Taxometric approach Image Segmentation using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions. Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. CCIS Springer-Verlag. 2014 * Edge detection: finding object edges * Color Analysis: Identify parts, products and items using color, assess quality from color, and isolate features using color. * Blob detection and extraction: inspecting an image for discrete blobs of connected pixels (e.g. a black hole in a grey object) as image landmarks. * Neural net / deep learning / machine learning processing: weighted and self-training multi-variable decision making Circa 2019 there is a large expansion of this, using deep learning and machine learning to significantly expand machine vision capabilities. * Pattern recognition including template matching. Finding, matching, and/or counting specific patterns. This may include location of an object that may be rotated, partially hidden by another object, or varying in size. * Barcode, Data Matrix and \\"2D barcode\\" reading * Optical character recognition: automated reading of text such as serial numbers * Gauging/Metrology: measurement of object dimensions (e.g. in pixels, inches or millimeters) *Comparison against target values to determine a \\"pass or fail\\" or \\"go/no go\\" result. For example, with code or bar code verification, the read value is compared to the stored target value. For gauging, a measurement is compared against the proper value and tolerances. For verification of alpha-numberic codes, the OCR'd value is compared to the proper or target value. For inspection for blemishes, the measured size of the blemishes may be compared to the maximums allowed by quality standards. =Outputs= A common output from automatic inspection systems is pass/fail decisions. These decisions may in turn trigger mechanisms that reject failed items or sound an alarm. Other common outputs include object position and orientation information for robot guidance systems. Additionally, output types include numerical measurement data, data read from codes and characters, counts and classification of objects, displays of the process or results, stored images, alarms from automated space monitoring MV systems, and process control signals.West, Perry A Roadmap For Building A Machine Vision System Pages 1-35 This also includes user interfaces, interfaces for the integration of multi-component systems and automated data interchange. Imaging based robot guidance Machine vision commonly provides location and orientation information to a robot to allow the robot to properly grasp the product. This capability is also used to guide motion that is simpler than robots, such as a 1 or 2 axis motion controller. The overall process includes planning the details of the requirements and project, and then creating a solution. This section describes the technical process that occurs during the operation of the solution. Many of the process steps are the same as with automatic inspection except with a focus on providing position and orientation information as the end result. Market As recently as 2006, one industry consultant reported that MV represented a $1.5 billion market in North America. However, the editor-in-chief of an MV trade magazine asserted that \\"machine vision is not an industry per se\\" but rather \\"the integration of technologies and products that provide services or applications that benefit true industries such as automotive or consumer goods manufacturing, agriculture, and defense.\\"  See also  * Machine vision glossary * Feature detection (computer vision) * Foreground detection * Vision processing unit * Optical sorting  References  Applications of computer vision Computer vision ","title":"Machine vision"},{"id":"172098","text":"Cushions: often found in piles Cushion from Museum of Yugoslavia A cushion is a soft bag of some ornamental material, stuffed with wool, hair, feathers, polyester staple fiber, non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments. It may be used for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch. Decorative cushions often have a patterned cover material, and are used as decoration for furniture. A cushion is also referred to as a bolster, hassock, headrest and a sham. Cushions and rugs can be used temporarily outside to soften a hard ground. They can be placed on sunloungers and used to prevent annoyances from moist grass and biting insects. Some dialects of English use this word to refer to throw pillows as well. The cushion is a very ancient article of furniture; the inventories of the contents of palaces and great houses in the early Middle Ages constantly made mention of them. Cushions were then often of great size, covered with leather, and firm enough to serve as a seat, but the steady tendency of all furniture has been to grow smaller with time. Today, the cushion is considered an upholstery item. Etymology The word cushion comes from Middle English cushin, from Anglo-French cussin, quissin, from Vulgar Latin *coxinus, and from Latin coxa, hip. The first known use of the word cushion was in the 14th century.

His 2001 novel The Corrections, a sprawling, satirical family drama, drew widespread critical acclaim, earned Franzen a National Book Award, was a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction finalist, earned a James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award. His novel Freedom (2010) garnered similar praise and led to an appearance on the cover of Time magazine alongside the headline \\"Great American Novelist\\". Franzen has contributed to The New Yorker magazine since 1994. His 1996 Harper's essay \\"Perchance to Dream\\" bemoaned the state of contemporary literature. Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter (\\"What happens to the people who want to communicate in depth, individual to individual, in the quiet and permanence of the printed word?\\"; \\"the actual substance of our daily lives is total electronic distraction\\") to the impermanence of e-books (\\"All the real things, the authentic things, the honest things, are dying off.\\") and the self-destruction of America. Early life and education Franzen was born in Western Springs, Illinois, the son of Irene (n√©e Super) and Earl T. Franzen. His father, raised in Minnesota, was the son of an immigrant from Sweden; his mother's ancestry was Eastern European. Franzen grew up in an old neighborhood, on 83 Webster Woods Drive in Webster Groves, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri, and graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in German in 1981. As part of his undergraduate education, he studied abroad in Germany during the 1979‚Äì80 academic year with Wayne State University's Junior Year in Munich program. While there, he met Michael A. Martone, on whom he would later base the character Walter Berglund in Freedom.Ferguson, Mark. \\"75 Years of the Junior Year in Munich.\\" Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching of German 40.2 (Fall 2007): 124-132; p.132. He also studied on a Fulbright Scholarship at Freie Universit√§t Berlin in Berlin in 1981-82; he speaks fluent German. Franzen was married in 1982 and moved with his wife to Somerville, Massachusetts to pursue a career as a novelist. While writing his first novel, The Twenty-Seventh City, he worked as a research assistant at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, coauthoring several dozen papers. In September 1987, a month after he and his wife moved to New York City, Franzen sold The Twenty-Seventh City to Farrar Straus & Giroux. Early novels The Twenty-Seventh City, published in 1988, is set in Franzen's hometown, St. Louis, and deals with the city's fall from grace, St. Louis having been the \\"fourth city\\" in the 1870s. This sprawling novel was warmly received and established Franzen as an author to watch.Laura Shapiro, \\"Terra Not So Firma,\\" Newsweek, January 20, 1992. (Shapiro: \\"A huge and masterly drama of St. Louis under siege, gripping and surreal and overwhelmingly convincing.\\" Shapiro also noted The Twenty-Seventh City's \\"brilliance,\\" and the author's \\"prodigious gifts,\\" concluding, \\"The news that he is at work on a third [novel] is welcome indeed.\\"] In a conversation with novelist Donald Antrim for Bomb Magazine, Franzen described The Twenty-Seventh City as \\"a conversation with the literary figures of my parents' generation[,] the great sixties and seventies Postmoderns.\\",Antrim, Donald. \\"Jonathan Franzen\\". Bomb Magazine. Fall 2001. Retrieved 2011-07-27. adding in a later interview \\"I was a skinny, scared kid trying to write a big novel. The mask I donned was that of a rhetorically airtight, extremely smart, extremely knowledgeable middle-aged writer.\\" Strong Motion (1992) focuses mainly on a dysfunctional family, the Hollands, and uses seismic events on the American East Coast as a metaphor for the quakes that occur in family life (as Franzen put it, \\"I imagined static lives being disrupted from without‚Äîliterally shaken. I imagined violent scenes that would strip away the veneer and get people shouting angry moral truths at each other.\\"). A 'systems novel', the key 'systems' of Strong Motion according to Franzen are \\"... the systems of science and religion‚Äîtwo violently opposing systems of making sense in the world.\\" The novel was not a financial success at the time of its publication. Franzen subsequently defended the novel in his 2010 Paris Review interview, remarking \\"I think they [critics and readers] may be overlooking Strong Motion a little bit.\\" Franzen taught a fiction-writing seminar at Swarthmore in the spring of 1992 and 1994: For the 1992 class, Franzen invited David Foster Wallace to be a guest judge of the workshop pieces. The Corrections Franzen's The Corrections, a novel of social criticism, garnered considerable critical acclaim in the United States, winning both the 2001 National Book Award for Fiction \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 2001\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-27.(With acceptance speech by Franzen and essays by Mary Jo Bang, David Ulin, and Lee Taylor Gaffigan from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) and the 2002 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. The novel was also a finalist for the 2001 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, the 2002 PEN/Faulkner Award, and the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (won by Richard Russo for Empire Falls).\\"Fiction\\". Past winners & finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2012-03-27. In September 2001, The Corrections was selected for Oprah Winfrey's book club. Franzen initially participated in the selection, sitting down for a lengthy interview with Oprah and appearing in B-roll footage in his hometown of St. Louis (described in an essay in How To Be Alone titled \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\"). In October 2001, however, The Oregonian printed an article in which Franzen expressed unease with the selection. In an interview on National Public Radio's Fresh Air, he expressed his worry that the Oprah logo on the cover dissuaded men from reading the book: Soon afterward, Franzen's invitation to appear on Oprah's show was rescinded. Winfrey announced, \\"Jonathan Franzen will not be on the Oprah Winfrey show because he is seemingly uncomfortable and conflicted about being chosen as a book club selection. It is never my intention to make anyone uncomfortable or cause anyone conflict. We have decided to skip the dinner and we're moving on to the next book.\\" These events gained Franzen and his novel widespread media attention. The Corrections soon became one of the decade's best-selling works of literary fiction. At the National Book Award ceremony, Franzen said \\"I'd also like to thank Oprah Winfrey for her enthusiasm and advocacy on behalf of The Corrections.\\" Following the success of The Corrections and the publication of The Discomfort Zone and How to Be Alone, Franzen began work on his next novel. In the interim, he published two short stories in The New Yorker: \\"Breakup Stories\\", published November 8, 2004, concerned the disintegration of four relationships; and \\"Two's Company\\", published May 23, 2005, concerned a couple who write for TV, then split up. In 2011, it was announced that Franzen would write a multi-part television adaptation of The Corrections in collaboration with The Squid and the Whale director Noah Baumbach for HBO. HBO has since passed on Corrections, citing \\"difficulty\\" in \\"adapting the book's challenging narrative, which moves through time and cuts forwards and back\\": that would be \\"difficult to sustain in a series and challenging for viewers to follow, hampering the potential show's accessibility.\\" In September 2019, The Corrections was voted sixteenth in a list of the 100 best books of the twenty-first century so far by writers and critics of the Guardian newspaper. Freedom Franzen at the 2008 Brooklyn Book Festival On June 8, 2009, Franzen published an excerpt from Freedom, his novel in progress, in The New Yorker. The excerpt, titled \\"Good Neighbors\\", concerned the trials and tribulations of a couple in St. Paul, Minnesota. On May 31, 2010, a second excerpt ‚Äî titled \\"Agreeable\\" ‚Äî was published, also in The New Yorker. On October 16, 2009, Franzen made an appearance alongside David Bezmozgis at the New Yorker Festival at the Cedar Lake Theatre, reading a portion of his forthcoming novel. Sam Allard, writing for North By Northwestern about the event, said that the \\"...material from his new (reportedly massive) novel\\" was \\"as buoyant and compelling as ever\\" and \\"marked by his familiar undercurrent of tragedy\\". Franzen read \\"an extended clip from the second chapter.\\" On September 9, 2010, Franzen appeared on Fresh Air to discuss Freedom in the wake of its release. Franzen has drawn what he describes as a \\"feminist critique\\" for the attention that male authors receive over female authors‚Äîa critique he supports. Franzen also discussed his friendship with David Foster Wallace and the impact of Wallace's suicide on his writing process. Freedom was the subject of a highly unusual \\"recall\\" in the United Kingdom starting in early October 2010. An earlier draft of the manuscript, to which Franzen had made over 200 changes, had been published by mistake. The publisher, HarperCollins, initiated an exchange program, but thousands of books had been distributed by that time. While promoting the book, Franzen became the first American author to appear on the cover of Time magazine since Stephen King in 2000. Franzen appeared alongside the headline \\"Great American Novelist\\". He discussed the implications of the Time coverage, and the reasoning behind the title of Freedom in an interview in Manchester, England, in October 2010. On September 17, 2010, Oprah Winfrey announced that Jonathan Franzen's Freedom would be an Oprah book club selection, the first of the last season of The Oprah Winfrey Show. On December 6, 2010, he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to promote Freedom where they discussed that book and the controversy over his reservations about her picking The Corrections and what that would entail. Franzen has stated the writing of Freedom was influenced by the death of his close friend and fellow novelist David Foster Wallace.Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Franzen: 'Modern life has become extremely distracting', The Guardian, 2 October 2015. Purity In an interview with Portland Monthly on December 18, 2012, Franzen revealed that he currently had \\"a four-page, single-spaced proposal\\" for a fifth novel he was currently working on, although he went on to suggest that while he had a proposal there was no guarantee that what was proposed would make the final cut, saying of similar proposals for previous novels, \\"I look at the old proposals now, and I see the one part of them that actually got made into a book, and I think, 'How come I couldn't see that? What is all this other stuff?'\\". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding \\"I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me.\\" In October 2014, during a discussion at Colgate University, Franzen read a \\"self-contained first-person narrative\\" that is part of a novel that he hoped will be out in the summer of 2015. On November 17, 2014, The New York Times Artsbeat Blog reported that the novel, titled Purity, would be out in September. Jonathan Galassi, president and publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, described Purity as a multigenerational American epic that spans decades and continents. The story centers on a young woman named Purity Tyler, or Pip, who doesn't know who her father is and sets out to uncover his identity. The narrative stretches from contemporary America to South America to East Germany before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and hinges on the mystery of Pip's family history and her relationship with a charismatic hacker and whistleblower. In 2016, Daily Variety reported that the novel was in the process of being adapted into a 20-hour limited series for Showtime by Todd Field who would share writing duties with Franzen and the playwright Sir David Hare. It would star Daniel Craig as Andreas Wolf and be executive produced by Field, Franzen, Craig, Hare & Scott Rudin. However, in a February 2018 interview with The Times London, Hare said that, given the budget for Field's adaptation (170 million), he doubted it would ever be made, but added \\"It was one of the richest and most interesting six weeks of my life, sitting in a room with Todd Field, Jonathan Franzen and Daniel Craig bashing out the story. They're extremely interesting people.\\" Purity was a relative commercial disappointment compared to Franzen's two previous novels, selling only 255,476 copies, compared to 1.15 million copies of Freedom and 1.6 million copies of The Corrections.Brodesser-Akner, Taffy (June 26, 2018). \\"Jonathan Franzen Is Fine With All of It.\\" The New York Times Magazine. Retrieved June 22, 2020. Other works Jonathan Franzen, 2010 In 1996, while still working on The Corrections, Franzen published a literary manifesto in Harper's Magazine entitled Perchance to Dream. Referencing manifestos written by Philip Roth and Tom Wolfe, among others, Franzen grappled with the novelist's role in an advanced media culture which seemed to no longer need the novel. In the end, Franzen rejects the goal of writing a great social novel about issues and ideas, in favor of focusing on the internal lives of characters and their emotions. Given the huge success of The Corrections, this essay offers a prescient look into Franzen's goals as both a literary and commercially minded author. In 2002, Franzen published a critique of the novels of William Gaddis, entitled \\"Mr. Difficult\\", in The New Yorker. He begins by recounting how some readers felt The Corrections was spoiled by being too high-brow in parts, and summarizes his own views of reading difficult fiction. He proposes a \\"Status model\\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Art, and also a \\"Contract model\\", whereby the point of fiction is to be Entertainment, and finds that he subscribes to both models. He praises The Recognitions, admits that he only got halfway through J R, and explains why he does not like the rest of Gaddis's novels. In 2004 Franzen published \\"The Discomfort Zone\\", a personal essay about his childhood and family life in Missouri and his love of Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts, in The New Yorker. Susan Orlean selected it for the subsequent volume of The Best American Essays. Since The Corrections Franzen has published How to Be Alone (2002), a collection of essays including \\"Perchance To Dream\\", and The Discomfort Zone (2006), a memoir. How To Be Alone is essentially an apologia for reading, articulating Franzen's uncomfortable relationship with the place of fiction in contemporary society. It also probes the influence of his childhood and adolescence on his creative life, which is then further explored in The Discomfort Zone. In September 2007, Franzen's translation of Frank Wedekind's play Spring Awakening () was published. In his introduction, Franzen describes the Broadway musical version as \\"insipid\\" and \\"overpraised.\\" In an interview with New York magazine, Franzen stated that he had in fact made the translation for Swarthmore College's theater department for $50 in 1986 and that it had sat in a drawer for 20 years since. After the Broadway show stirred up so much interest, Franzen said he was inspired to publish it because \\"I knew it was a good translation, better than anything else out there.\\" Franzen published a social commentary on cell phones, sentimentality, and the decline of public space, \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" (2008), in the September/October 2008 issue of MIT Technology Review. In 2012 he published Farther Away, a collection of essays dealing with such topics as his love of birds, his friendship with David Foster Wallace, and his thoughts on technology. In 2013, Franzen published The Kraus Project. It consists of three major essays by the \\"Perennially ... impossible to translate\\" Austrian \\"playwright, poet, social commentator and satirical genius\\" Karl Kraus ‚Äì \\"\\"Heine and the Consequences\\" a takedown of the beloved German poet, \\"Nestroy and Posterity\\" which established that playwright's reputation in Austria to this day, and \\"Afterword to Heine and the Consequences\\"\\". The essays are accompanied by \\"Franzen's [own] plentiful, trenchant yet off-beat annotations\\" taking on \\"... Kraus' mantle- commenting on what Kraus would say (and what Franzen's opinion is) about Macs and PCs; decrying Twitter's claim of credit for the Arab Spring; and unfurling how media conglomerates influence politics in their quest for profits.\\" Franzen published his third essay collection, The End of the End of the Earth: Essays, in November 2018.https://us.macmillan.com/theendoftheendoftheearth/jonathanfranzen/9780374147938/ According to advance press for the book, the collection \\"gathers essays and speeches written mostly in the past five years, [and] Jonathan Franzen returns with renewed vigor to the themes‚Äîboth human and literary‚Äîthat have long preoccupied him. Whether exploring his complex relationship with his uncle, recounting his young adulthood in New York, or offering an illuminating look at the global seabird crisis, these pieces contain all the wit and disabused realism that we've come to expect from Franzen. Taken together, these essays trace the progress of a unique and mature mind wrestling with itself, with literature, and with some of the most important issues of our day, made more pressing by the current political milieu. The End of the End of the Earth is remarkable, provocative, and necessary.\\" In September 2019, Franzen published an essay on climate change in The New Yorker entitled \\"What If We Stopped Pretending\\", which generated controversy among scientists and online pundits because of its alleged pessimism. The piece also garnered praise and support from multiple outlets, and was named by The New Yorker as one of its top five most read articles of 2019. A Sierra Club interview with Franzen, from January 2019, further explores Franzen's feelings about climate change and action. In an interview with Transatlantica conducted in March 2018, Franzen mentioned that he had just started work on a new novel, having recently sold it to publishers on the basis of a three-page proposal.Potier, J√©r√©my (November 29, 2018). \\"An Interview with Jonathan Franzen.\\" Transatlantica 12017. Retrieved July 15, 2020. Later that year in a profile piece for The New York Times Magazine in June 2018, Franzen confirmed that he was currently at work on the early stages of his sixth novel, which he speculated could be his last. \\"So, I may be wrong ... But somehow this new one really does feel like my last.\\". Subsequently, in an interview reproduced on The Millions website in April 2020, Franzen mentioned that he was \\"almost done\\" with writing this sixth novel, although further indications of the title, plot, and likely publication date were not forthcoming.Qian, Jianan (April 23, 2020). \\"Giving Voice to Shame and Fear: The Millions Interviews Jonathan Franzen.\\" The Millions. Retrieved October 4, 2020. Philosophy of writing Franzen at the 2010 National Book Critics Circle awards During a lecture on autobiography and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked of him by audiences, all of which annoy or bother him in some way. They are: * Who are your influences? * What time of day do you work, and what do you write on? * I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters \\"take over\\" and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? * Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular \\"This one always raises my blood pressure\\" and quoted Nabokov in response. In February 2010, Franzen (along with writers such as Richard Ford, Margaret Atwood, and Anne Enright) was asked by The Guardian to contribute what he believed were ten serious rules to abide by for aspiring writers. Personal life In his early 20s, Franzen was married to fellow writer Valerie Cornell. They lived in New York City and were married for fourteen years. His marriage and divorce are mentioned in some of his essays in the collection Farther Away. Franzen lives in Santa Cruz, California with his \\"spouse-equivalent\\", writer Kathy Chetkovich. As first reported in his essay \\"My Bird Problem,\\" Franzen is well known as a serious birdwatcher. He appeared on CBS Sunday Morning in March 2018 to discuss his love of birds and birdwatching. Franzen served for nine years on the board of the American Bird Conservancy. A feature-length documentary based on Franzen's reported essay \\"Emptying the Skies\\" was released in 2013. Franzen is a longtime fan of the punk-rock collective The Mekons; he appeared in the 2014 documentary Revenge of the Mekons to discuss the group's importance to him. In 2010, at an event at the Serpentine Pavilion in London celebrating the launch of Freedom, Franzen's glasses were stolen from his face by a gate-crasher, who jokingly attempted to ransom them for $100,000 before being apprehended by police elsewhere in Hyde Park.

The crime in question typically involves a crime scene with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, for example: a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax. To investigators of the crime, the prima facie impression almost invariably is that the perpetrator has vanished into thin air. The need for a rational explanation for the crime is what drives the protagonist to look beyond these appearances and solve the puzzle. History of the genre The earliest fully-fledged example of this type of story is generally held to be Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1841). Robert Adey credits Sheridan Le Fanu for A Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess which was published three years before Poe's ‚ÄúRue Morgue‚Äù. Other early locked- room mysteries include Israel Zangwill's The Big Bow Mystery (1892), Le Myst√®re de la Chambre Jaune (The Mystery of the Yellow Room) written in 1907 by French journalist and author Gaston Leroux and \\"The Problem of Cell 13\\" by Jacques Futrelle and featuring \\"The Thinking Machine\\" Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen. G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown stories often featured locked-room mysteries and other mystery authors dabbled in the genre such as S. S. Van Dine in The Canary Murder Case, Ellery Queen in The Chinese Orange Mystery and Freeman Wills Crofts in such novels as Sudden Death and The End of Andrew Harrison. John Dickson Carr, who also wrote as Carter Dickson, was known as \\"master of the locked-room mystery\\". His 1935 novel The Hollow Man (US title: The Three Coffins) was in 1981 voted the best locked-room mystery novel of all time by 17 authors and reviewers, although Carr himself names Gaston Leroux's The Mystery of the Yellow Room (1907-1908) as his favorite. (Leroux's novel was named third in that same poll; Hake Talbot's Rim of the Pit (1944) was named second.) Three other Carr/Dickson novels were in the top ten of the 1981 list: The Crooked Hinge (1938), The Judas Window (1938), and The Peacock Feather Murders (1937). In French, Pierre Boileau, Thomas Narcejac, Gaston Boca, Marcel Lanteaume, Pierre Very, Noel Vindry and the Belgian Stanislas- Andre Steeman were other important impossible crime writers, Vindry being the most prolific with 16 novels. Edgar Faure, later to become Prime Minister of France, was a not particularly successful contemporary. During the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, English-speaking writers dominated the genre, but after the 1940s there was a general waning of English-language output. French authors continued writing into the 1950s and early 1960s, notably Martin Meroy and Boileau-Narcejac, who joined forces to write several locked-room novels. They also co-authored the psychological thrillers which brought them international fame, two of which were adapted for the screen as Vertigo (1954 novel; 1958 film) and Diabolique (1955 film). The most prolific writer during the period immediately following the Golden Age was Japanese: Akimitsu Takagi wrote almost 30 locked-room mysteries, starting in 1949 and continuing to his death in 1995. A number have been translated into English. The genre continued into the 1970s and beyond. Bill Pronzini's Nameless Detective novels feature locked-room puzzles. The most prolific creator of impossible crimes is Edward D. Hoch, whose short stories feature a detective, Dr. Sam Hawthorne, whose main role is as a country physician. The majority of Hoch stories feature impossible crimes; one appeared in EQMM every month from May 1973 through January 2008. Hoch's protagonist is a gifted amateur detective who uses pure brainpower to solve his cases. The French writer Paul Halter, whose output of over 30 novels is almost exclusively of the locked-room genre, has been described as the natural successor to John Dickson Carr. Although strongly influenced by Carr and Agatha Christie, he has a unique writing style featuring original plots and puzzles. A collection of ten of his short stories, entitled The Night of the Wolf, has been translated into English. The Japanese writer Soji Shimada has been writing impossible crime stories since 1981 and has created 13 to date. The first, The Tokyo Zodiac Murders (1981) and the second, Murder in the Crooked House (1982) are the only ones to have been translated into English. The themes of the Japanese novels are far more grisly and violent than those of the more genteel Anglo-Saxons. Dismemberment is a preferred murder method. Despite the gore, the norms of the classic detective fiction novel are strictly followed. Umberto Eco, in the 2000 novel Baudolino, takes the locked-room theme into medieval times. The book's plot suggests that Emperor Frederick I had not drowned in a river, as history records, but died mysteriously at night while a guest at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. The book features various suspects, each of whom had a clever means of killing the Emperor without entering the room where he slept ‚Äì all these means having been available in medieval times. The locked-room genre also appears in children's detective fiction, although the crime committed is usually less severe than murder. One notable example is Enid Blyton, who wrote several juvenile detective series, often featuring seemingly impossible crimes that her young amateur detectives set out to solve. The Hardy Boys novel While the Clock Ticked was (originally) about a locked and isolated room where a man seeks privacy, but receives mysterious threatening messages there. The messages are delivered by a mechanical device lowered into the room through a chimney. King Ottokar's Sceptre (1938-1939) is the only Tintin adventure that is a locked-room mystery. No homicide is involved. The crime is the disappearance of the royal sceptre that is bound to have disastrous consequences for the king. The TV series Jonathan Creek has a particular 'speciality' for locked-room-murder style mysteries; Creek designs magic tricks for stage magicians, and is often called on to solve cases where the mystery is clearly how the crime was committed as the most important element, such as a man who allegedly shot himself in a sealed bunker when he had crippling arthritis in his hands, how a woman was shot in a sealed room with no gun and without the window being opened or broken, how a dead body could have vanished from a locked room when the only door was in full view of someone else, etc. Pulp magazines in the 1930s often contained impossible crime tales, dubbed weird menace, in which a series of supernatural or science-fiction type events is eventually explained rationally. Notable practitioners of the period were Fredric Brown, Paul Chadwick and, to a certain extent, Cornell Woolrich, although these writers tended to rarely use the Private Eye protagonists that many associate with pulp fiction. Quite a few comic book impossible crimes seem to draw on the \\"weird menace\\" tradition of the pulps. However, celebrated writers such as G. K. Chesterton, Arthur Conan Doyle, Clayton Rawson, and Sax Rohmer have had their works adapted to comic book form. In 1934, Dashiell Hammett created the comic strip Secret Agent X9, illustrated by Alex Raymond, which contained a locked-room episode. One American comic book series that made good use of locked-room mysteries is Mike W. Barr's Maze Agency. In the 21st century, examples of popular detective series novels that include locked-room type puzzles are The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2005) by Stieg Larssen, Bloodhounds (2004) by Peter Lovesey and In the Morning I'll Be Gone (2014) by Adrian McKinty. The popular video game Daganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (2010) has a chapter featuring a locked room mystery. So does one of its sequels, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony (2017). Real-life examples * According to a report in The New York Times, March 10 and 11, 1929, Isidore Fink, of 4 East 132nd Street, New York City, was in his Fifth Avenue laundry on the night of March 9, 1929, with the windows closed and door of the room bolted. A neighbor heard screams and the sound of blows (but no shots), and called the police, who were unable to get in. A young boy was lifted through the transom and was able to unbolt the door. On the floor lay Fink with two bullet wounds in his chest and one in his left wrist. He was dead. There was money in his pockets, and the cash register had not been touched. No weapon was found. There was a theory that the murderer had crawled through the transom, but to do so they would have to have been no bigger than a small child and would have had to leave the same way, as the door was bolted. Another theory had the murderer firing through the transom, but Fink's wrist was powder-burned, indicating that he had not been fired at from a distance. More than two years later, Police Commissioner Mulrooney, in a radio talk, called this murder in a closed room an \\"insoluble mystery\\". * On May 16, 1937, Laetitia Toureaux was found stabbed to death in an otherwise empty first-class compartment of the Paris M√©tro. The subway train had left the terminus, Porte de Charenton, at 6:27 p.m. and had arrived at the next station, Porte Dor√©e, at 6:28 p.m. Witnesses did not see anyone else enter or leave the compartment where Mlle. Toureaux's body was found. The murderer had one minute and twenty seconds at their disposal. Neither the murderer nor the method of their escape was ever discovered. * In 2010, the body of Gareth Williams, a MI6 employee, was found in a bag that was zipped up and padlocked from the outside, with a key inside. There was no forensic evidence of anyone else's involvement. Despite suggestions that he may somehow have locked himself inside the bag, two escapologists failed to replicate the feat despite 400 attempts, though one would not rule it out.

The palace based Minoan civilization was the first civilization in Europe. After the Minoan civilization was devastated by the Thera eruption, Crete developed an Ancient Greece-influenced organization of city states, then successively became part of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, autonomous state, and the modern state of Greece.Chris Moorey, A History of Crete (Haus, 2019).

This was a sensational discovery, as the previously accepted earliest sea crossing in the Mediterranean was thought to occur around 12,000 BC. The stone tools found in the Plakias region of Crete include hand axes of the Acheulean type made of quartz. It is believed that pre-Homo sapiens hominids from Africa crossed to Crete on rafts.Wilford, J.N., On Crete, New Evidence of Very Ancient Mariners The New York Times, 15 Feb 2010.Bruce Bower, Hominids Went Out of Africa on Rafts Wired Science, January 8, 2010. In the neolithic period, some of the early influences on the development of Cretan culture arise from the Cyclades and from Egypt; cultural records are written in the undeciphered script known as \\"Linear A\\". The archaeological record of Crete includes superb palaces, houses, roads, paintings and sculptures. Early Neolithic settlements in Crete include Knossos and Trapeza. Because of a lack of written records, estimates of Cretan chronology are based on well- established Aegean and Ancient Near Eastern pottery styles, so that Cretan timelines have been made by seeking Cretan artifacts traded with other civilizations (such as the Egyptians) ‚Äì a well established occurrence. For the earlier times, radiocarbon dating of organic remains and charcoal offers independent dates. Based on this, it is thought that Crete was inhabited from the 7th millennium BC onwards. The native fauna of Crete included pygmy hippo, pygmy elephant Paleoloxodon chaniensis, dwarf deer Praemegaceros cretensis, giant rodents and insectivores as well as badger, beech marten and Lutrogale cretensis, a kind of terrestrial otter. Large mammalian carnivores were lacking; in their stead, the flightless Cretan owl was the apex predator. Most of these animals died out at the end of the last ice-age. Humans played a part in this extinction, which occurred on other medium to large Mediterranean islands as well;, for example, on Cyprus, Sicily and Majorca. Remains of a settlement found under the Bronze Age palace at Knossos date to the 7th millennium BC. The first settlers introduced cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs, as well as domesticated cereals and legumes. Up to now, Knossos remains the only aceramic site. The settlement covered approximately 350,000 square metres. The sparse animal bones contain the above-mentioned domestic species as well as deer, badger, marten and mouse: the extinction of the local megafauna had not left much game behind. Neolithic pottery is known from Knossos, Lera Cave and Gerani Cave. The Late Neolithic sees a proliferation of sites, pointing to a population increase. In the late Neolithic, the donkey and the rabbit were introduced to the island; deer and agrimi were hunted. The Kri-kri, a feral goat, preserves traits of the early domesticates. Horse, fallow deer and hedgehog are only attested from Minoan times onwards. Minoan civilization and Mycenaean Period Crete was the centre of Europe's most ancient civilization, the Minoans. Tablets inscribed in Linear A have been found in numerous sites in Crete, and a few in the Aegean islands. The Minoans established themselves in many islands besides Ancient Crete: secure identifications of Minoan off-island sites include Kea, Kythera, Milos, Rhodes, and above all, Thera (Santorini). Archaeologists ever since Sir Arthur Evans have identified and uncovered the palace-complex at Knossos, the most famous Minoan site. Other palace sites in Crete such as Phaistos have uncovered magnificent stone-built, multi-story palaces containing drainage systems,C.Michael Hogan, Phaistos Fieldnotes, The Modern Antiquarian (2007) and the queen had a bath and a flushing toilet. The expertise displayed in the hydraulic engineering was of a very high level. There were no defensive walls to the complexes. By the 16th century BC pottery and other remains on the Greek mainland show that the Minoans had far-reaching contacts on the mainland. In the 16th century a major earthquake caused destruction on Crete and on Thera that was swiftly repaired. By about the 15th century BC a massive volcanic explosion known as the Minoan eruption blew the island of Thera apart, casting more than four times the amount of ejecta as the explosion of Krakatoa and generating a tsunami in the enclosed Aegean that threw pumice up to 250 meters above sea level onto the slopes of Anaphi, 27 km to the east. Any fleet along the north shore of Crete was destroyed and John Chadwick suggests that the majority of Cretan fleets had kept the island secure from the Greek-speaking mainlanders. The sites, save Knossos, were destroyed by fires. Mycenaeans from the mainland took over Knossos, rebuilding some parts to suit them. They were in turn subsumed by a subsequent Dorian migration. Iron Age and Archaic Crete The collapse of the Mycenaean civilization was followed by the appearance of the first Greek city-states in the 9th century BC and the epics of Homer in the 8th century BC. Some of the Dorian cities that prospered on Crete during those times are Kydonia, Lato, Dreros, Gortyn and Eleutherna. Classical and Hellenistic Crete In the Classical and Hellenistic period Crete fell into a pattern of combative city-states, harboring pirates. In the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, Gortyn, Kydonia (Chania), Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos. While the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two coalitions of cities. As a result, the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War (205‚Äì200 BC), when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs. In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (Ierapetra) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.  Roman, Byzantine and Arab Crete  In 88 BC Mithridates VI of Pontus on the Black Sea, went to war to halt the advance of Roman hegemony in the Aegean. On the pretext that Knossos was backing Mithradates, Marcus Antonius Creticus attacked Crete in 71 BC and was repelled. Rome sent Quintus Caecilius Metellus with three legions to the island. After a ferocious three-year campaign Crete was conquered for Rome in 69 BC, earning this Metellus the agnomen \\"Creticus.\\" At the archaeological sites, there seems to be little evidence of widespread damage associated with the transfer to Roman power: a single palatial house complex seems to have been razed. Gortyn seems to have been pro-Roman and was rewarded by being made the capital of the joint province of Crete and Cyrenaica. Gortyn was the site of the largest Christian basilica on Crete, the Basilica of Saint Titus, dedicated to the first Christian bishop in Crete, to whom Paul addressed one of his epistles. The church was begun in the 1st century. As revealed in the Epistle to Titus in the New Testament and confirmed by Cretan poet Epimenides, the people of Crete were considered to be always liars, evil beasts and gluttons. (Note: Epimenides was a poet in the 6th century BC. Paul cited him in Titus 1:12.) Crete continued to be part of the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire, a quiet cultural backwater, until it fell into the hands of Iberian Muslims under Abu Hafs in the 820s, who established a piratical emirate on the island. The archbishop Cyril of Gortyn was killed and the city so thoroughly devastated it was never reoccupied. Candia (Chandax, modern Heraklion), a city built by the Iberian Muslims, was made capital of the island instead. The Emirate of Crete became a center of Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, and a thorn in Byzantium's side. Successive campaigns to recover the island failed until 961, when Nikephoros Phokas reconquered Crete for the Byzantine Empire and made it into a theme.Panagiotakis, Introduction, p. XVI. The Byzantines held the island until the Fourth Crusade (1204). In its aftermath, possession of the island was disputed between the Genoese and the Venetians, with the latter eventually solidifying their control by 1212. Despite frequent revolts by the native population, the Venetians retained the island until 1669, when the Ottoman Empire took possession of it. (The standard survey for this period is I.F. Sanders, An archaeological survey and Gazetteer of Late Hellenistic, Roman and Early Byzantine Crete, 1982) *Annette Bingham, \\"Crete's Roman past: excavations yield antiquities from the Roman period,\\" History Today, November 1995 Venetian Crete (1205‚Äì1669) Venetian propaganda during the Siege: Il regno tutto di Candia, Marco Boschini, 1651 In the partition of the Byzantine empire after the capture of Constantinople by the armies of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Crete was eventually acquired by Venice, which held it for more than four centuries (the \\"Kingdom of Candia\\"). The most important of the many rebellions that broke out during that period was the one known as the revolt of St. Titus. It occurred in 1363, when indigenous Cretans and Venetian settlers exasperated by the hard tax policy exercised by Venice, overthrew official Venetian authorities and declared an independent Cretan Republic. The revolt took Venice five years to quell. During Venetian rule, the Greek population of Crete was exposed to Renaissance culture. A thriving literature in the Cretan dialect of Greek developed on the island. The best-known work from this period is the poem Erotokritos by Vitsentzos Kornaros (ŒíŒπœÑœÉŒ≠ŒΩŒ∂ŒøœÇ ŒöŒøœÅŒΩŒ¨œÅŒøœÇ). Another major Cretan literary figures were Marcus Musurus (1470‚Äì1517), Nicholas Kalliakis (1645‚Äì1707), Andreas Musalus (1665‚Äì1721), and other Greek scholars and philosophers who flourished in Italy in the 15‚Äì17th centuries. Georgios Hortatzis was author of the dramatic work Erophile. The painter Domenicos Theotocopoulos, better known as El Greco, was born in Crete in this period and was trained in Byzantine iconography before moving to Italy and later, Spain. Ottoman Crete (1669‚Äì1898) Ottoman siege of Candia Crete or Candia in 1861 During the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669), Venice was pushed out of Crete by the Ottoman Empire, with most of the island lost after the siege of Candia (1648‚Äì1669), possibly the longest siege in history. The last Venetian outpost on the island, Spinalonga, fell in 1718, and Crete was a part of the Ottoman Empire for the next two centuries. There were significant rebellions against Ottoman rule, particularly in Sfakia. Daskalogiannis was a famous rebel leader. One result of the Ottoman conquest was that a sizeable proportion of the population gradually converted to Islam, with its tax and other civic advantages in the Ottoman system. Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.Excerpts from William Yale, The Near East: A modern history by (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958) Some Muslim converts were crypto-Christians, who converted back to Christianity; others fled Crete because of the unrest. By the last Ottoman census in 1881, Christians were 76% of the population, and Muslims (usually called \\"Turks\\" regardless of language, culture, and ancestry) only 24%. Christians were over 90% of the population in 19 out of 23 of the districts of Crete, but Muslims were over 60% in the three large towns on the north coast, and in Monofatsi.A. Lily Macrakis, Cretan Rebel: Eleftherios Venizelos in Ottoman Crete, Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard University, 1983. = Greek War of Independence (1821) = The Greek War of Independence began in 1821, with extensive Cretan participation. An uprising by Christians met with a fierce response from the Ottoman authorities and the execution of several bishops, regarded as ringleaders. Between 1821 and 1828, the island was the scene of repeated hostilities. The Muslims were driven into the large fortified towns on the north coast and it would appear that as many as 60% of them died from plague or famine while there. The Cretan Christians also suffered severely, losing around 21% of their population in the 1830s. After Greece achieved its independence, Crete became an object of contention as the Christian part of its population revolted several times against Ottoman rule. Revolts in 1841 and 1858 secured some privileges, such as the right to bear arms, equality of Christian and Muslim worship, and the establishment of Christian councils of elders with jurisdiction over education and customary law. Despite these concessions, the Christian Cretans maintained their ultimate aim of union with Greece, and tensions between the Christian and Muslim communities ran high. Thus, in 1866 the great Cretan Revolt began. The uprising, which lasted for three years, involved volunteers from Greece and other European countries, where it was viewed with considerable sympathy. Despite early successes of the rebels, who quickly confined the Ottomans to the northern towns, the uprising failed. The Ottoman Grand Vizier A'ali Pasha personally assumed control of the Ottoman forces and launched a methodical campaign to retake the rural districts, which was combined with promises of political concessions, notably by the introduction of an Organic Law, which gave the Cretan Christians equal (in practice, because of their superior numbers, majority) control of local administration. His approach bore fruits, as the rebel leaders gradually submitted. By early 1869, the island was again under Ottoman control. During the Congress of Berlin in the summer of 1878, there was a further rebellion, which was halted quickly by the intervention of the British and the adaptation of the 1867-8 Organic Law into a constitutional settlement known as the Pact of Halepa. Crete became a semi-independent parliamentary state within the Ottoman Empire under an Ottoman Governor who had to be a Christian. A number of the senior \\"Christian Pashas\\" including Photiades Pasha and Kostis Adosidis Pasha ruled the island in the 1880s, presiding over a parliament in which liberals and conservatives contended for power. Disputes between the two powers led to a further insurgency in 1889 and the collapse of the Pact of Halepa arrangements. The international powers, disgusted at what seemed to be factional politics, allowed the Ottoman authorities to send troops to the island and restore order but did not anticipate that Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II would use this as a pretext to end the Halepa Pact Constitution and instead rule the island by martial law. This action led to international sympathy for the Cretan Christians and to a loss of any remaining acquiescence among them to continued Ottoman rule. When a small insurgency began in September 1895, it spread quickly, and by the summer of 1896 the Ottoman forces had lost military control of most of the island. A new Cretan insurrection in 1897 led to the Ottoman Empire declaring war on Greece. However, the Great Powers (Austria-Hungary, France, the German Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom) decided that the Ottoman Empire could no longer maintain control and intervened, dispatching a multinational naval force, the International Squadron, to Cretan waters in February 1897. The squadron's senior admirals formed an \\"Admirals Council\\" which temporarily governed the island. The International Squadron bombarded Cretan insurgents, placed sailors and marines ashore, and instituted a blockade of Crete and key ports in Greece, bringing organized combat on the island to an end by late March 1897. Soldiers from the armies of five of the powers (Germany refused to participate) then occupied key cities in Crete during late March and April 1897.McTiernan, pp. 13‚Äì23. Eventually, the Admirals Council decided to establish an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire on Crete.McTiernan, p. 28. After a violent riot by Cretan Turks on 6 September 1898 (25 August according to the Julian calendar then in use on Crete, which was 12 days behind the modern Gregorian calendar during the 19th century), the admirals also decided to expel all Ottoman troops from Crete, which was accomplished on 6 November 1898. When Prince George of Greece arrived in Crete on 21 December 1898 (9 December according to the Julian calendar) as the first High Commissioner of the autonomous Cretan State, Crete effectively was detached from the Ottoman Empire, although it remained under the Sultan's suzerainty.McTiernan, pp. 35‚Äì39. Modern Crete =Cretan State= Flag of the Cretan State (1898‚Äì1908) After the expulsion of Ottoman forces in November 1898, and the autonomous Cretan State (Official Greek name: ŒöœÅŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµŒØŒ±), headed by Prince George of Greece and Denmark, was founded under Ottoman suzerainty in December 1898. Prince George was replaced by Alexandros Zaimis in 1906, and in 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies declared union with Greece.Ion, Theodore P., \\"The Cretan Question,\\" The American Journal of International Law, April, 1910, pp. 276‚Äì284 But this act was not recognized internationally until 1913 after the Balkan Wars when, by the Treaty of London, Sultan Mehmed V relinquished his formal rights to the island. In December, the Greek flag was raised at the Firkas fortress in Chania, with Eleftherios Venizelos and King Constantine in attendance, and Crete was unified with mainland Greece. The Muslim (Turkish?) minority of Crete initially remained on the island but was later relocated to Turkey under the general population exchange agreed in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne between Turkey and Greece. One of the most important figures to emerge from the end of Ottoman Crete was the liberal politician Eleftherios Venizelos, probably the most important statesman of modern Greece. Venizelos was an Athens-trained lawyer who was active in liberal circles in Chania, then the Cretan capital. After autonomy, he was first a minister in the government of Prince George and then his most formidable opponent. In 1910 Venizelos transferred his career to Athens, quickly became the dominant figure on the political scene and in 1912, after careful preparations for a military alliance against the Ottoman Empire with Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria, allowed Cretan deputies to take their place in the Greek Parliament. This was treated as grounds for war by Ottoman Empire but the Balkan allies won a series of sweeping victories in the hostilities that followed (see Balkan Wars). Ottoman Empire was effectively defeated in the ensuing war and were forced out of the Balkans and Thrace by the Alliance, except for the borders which Turkey continues to hold to this day. =World War II= Battle of Greece In 1939, the United Kingdom guaranteed military aid to Greece if its territorial integrity was threatened.Jo√´lle Dal√®gre, op. cit., p.20 The priority of the United Kingdom was to prevent Crete from falling into enemy hands, because the island could be used to defend Egypt, (the Suez Canal and the route to India).Van Creveld, op. cit., p. 67. British troops landed on Crete with the consent of the Greek Government from 3 November 1940, in order to make the 5th Greek Division of Crete available for the Albanian front. The invasion of mainland Greece by the Axis powers began on 6 April 1941 and was complete within a few weeks despite the intervention of the armies of the Commonwealth along with Greece. King George II and the Government of Emmanouil Tsouderos were forced to flee Athens and took refuge in Crete on April 23. Crete was also the refuge of Commonwealth troops that fled from the beaches of Attica and the Peloponnese to Crete to organize a new front of resistance. Battle of Crete After the conquest of mainland Greece, Germany turned to Crete and the last stage of the Balkans campaign. After a fierce and bloody conflict between Nazi Germany and the Allies (United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Greece) that lasted ten days (between the 20 and 31 May 1941), the island fell to the Germans. On the morning of 20 May 1941, Crete was the theater of the first major airborne assault in history. The Third Reich launched an airborne invasion of Crete under the code name of \\"Operation Mercury\\". 17,000 paratroopers under the command of General Kurt Student were dropped at three strategic locations with airfields: Maleme, Heraklion, and Rethymnon. Their goal was the capture and control of the three airfields to allow the arrival of reinforcements airlifted by the Luftwaffe from mainland Greece to bypass the Royal Navy and the Hellenic Navy who still controlled the seas. On 1 June 1941 the Allies completely evacuated the island of Crete. Despite the victory of the German invaders, the elite German paratroopers suffered such heavy losses, from the resistance of the Allied troops and civilians, that Adolf Hitler forbade further airborne operations of such large scale for the rest of the war.Beevor, op. cit., p. 231 The Cretan Resistance Murder of Greek civilians in Kondomari by German paratroopers in 1941 From the first days of the invasion, the local population organized a resistance movement, participating widely in guerrilla groups and intelligence networks. The first resistance groups formed in the Cretan mountains as early as June 1941. In September 1943, a memorable battle between the troops of occupation resistance fighters led by \\"Kapetan\\" Bandouvas in the region of Syme resulted in the deaths of eighty-three German soldiers and another thirteen were taken as prisoners. There were reprisals for resistance, German officers routinely used firing squads against Cretan civilians and razed villages to the ground. Standing out amongst the atrocities, are the holocausts of Viannos and Kedros in Amari, the destruction of Anogeia and Kandanos and the massacre of Kondomari.Beevor, Antony. Crete: The Battle and the Resistance, John Murray Ltd, 1991. Penguin Books, 1992. .  Liberation  By late 1944 German forces were withdrawing from Greece to avoid being cut off by the advancing Russian army moving west across Europe. By the end of September, German and Italian troops began withdrawing from Crete, and on October 13 both Rethymon and Heraklion were liberated as the occupying forces were withdrawn to the Chania area. On May 9, 1945 the German Commander signed an unconditional surrender at the Villa Ariadne at Knossos, effective ‚Äú10 o'clock Greenwich Mean Time on the tenth day of May 1945‚Äù Other notable historical events =Cretan School of Art= An important school of icon painting, under the umbrella of post-Byzantine art with Latin influences, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. =Cretan literature= The Cretan literature due to the economic and intellectual growth observed in Crete during the Venetian era, it was rich in quantity and quality and important for the subsequent course of Modern Greek literature. The peaceful living and contact with a developed intellectual and cultural people were the factors that contributed to the cultivation of education and literature and the emergence of remarkable literary production. =The Black Death= As a result of plagues of the Black Death, many Cretans migrated overseas during difficult periods on the island, some acquiring great fortune abroad, such as Constantine Corniaktos (c. 1517‚Äì1603) who became one of the richest people in Eastern Europe.

Early life and family Juan O'Gorman was born on 6 July 1905 in Coyoac√°n, then a village to the south of Mexico City and now a borough of the Federal District, to an Irish immigrant father, Cecil and Encarnaci√≥n O'Gorman (n√©e O'Gorman). His parents were distant cousins. He had three younger siblings, Edmundo, Margarita and Tom√°s. In the 1920s he studied architecture at the Academy of San Carlos, the Art and Architecture school at the National Autonomous University. His first marriage was to Nina Wright, Russian-American architect. He later married Helen Fowler, an American artist with whom he had an adopted daughter.  Career  = San √Ångel houses = In 1929, O'Gorman purchased a plot containing two tennis courts in Mexico City's San √Ångel colonia. On the plot, O'Gorman constructed a small house and studio intended for use by his father, now known as the Cecil O'Gorman House. The building's forms were strongly influenced by the work of Le Corbusier, whose theories of architecture O'Gorman studied. O'Gorman dubbed the house the first functionalist structure in Latin America. Diego Rivera, a contemporary of O'Gorman, impressed with the design of the Cecil O'Gorman House, commissioned the architect to design a home for him and Frida Kahlo on an adjacent plot. The house was built in a similar functionalist style from 1931 to 1932. The Rivera-Kahlo house was two houses connected by a bridge. Both houses were purchased to be restored and opened to the public with the Rivera-Kahlo house operating as a museum.

The schools were built with the philosophy of \\"eliminating all architectural style and executing constructions technically.\\" After 6 years of functionalist projects, O'Gorman turned away from strict functionalism later in life and worked to develop an organic architecture, combining the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright with traditional Mexican constructions. = Later work = O'Gorman built and designed his own house in the suburb of Pedregal, which was part built structure part natural cave, which is known as \\"The Cave House\\" from 1953 to 1956. It was decorated with mosaics throughout. It was demolished in 1969. His paintings often treated Mexican history, landscape, and legends. A mural commission in P√°tzcuaro, Michoacan resulted in the huge \\"La historia de Michoac√°n\\" in the Biblioteca P√∫blica Gertrudis Bocanegra in a former church.Jolly, Jennifer, Creating P√°tzcuaro, Creating Mexico: Art, Tourism, and Nation Building Under L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Austin: University of Texas Press 2018. He painted the murals in the Independence Room in Mexico City's Chapultepec Castle, and the huge murals of his own 1952 Central Library of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, designed with Gustavo Saavedra and Juan Mart√≠nez de Velasco. In 1959, together with fellow artists, Ra√∫l Anguiano, Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n, and Carlos Orozco Romero, O'Gorman founded the militant Uni√≥n de Pintores y Grabadores de M√©xico (Mexican Painters and Engravers Union). He died on 17 January 1982, as a result of suicide. Authorities believe the artist grew despondent after being diagnosed with a heart ailment which curtailed his work. O'Gorman was found dead at his home. Central Library at Ciudad Universitaria (UNAM) Central Library at UNAM Juan O'Gorman's most celebrated work due to its creativity, construction technique, and dimensions, are the four thousand square meters murals covering the four faces of the building of the Central Library at Ciudad Universitaria at UNAM. These murals are mosaics made from millions of colored stones that he gathered all around Mexico in order to be able to obtain the different colors he needed. The north side pictures Mexico's pre-Hispanic past and the south facade its colonial one, while the east wall depicts the contemporary world, and the west shows the university and contemporary Mexico. \\"From the beginning, I had the idea of making mosaics of colored stones in the walls of the collections, with a technique in which I was already well experienced.

Pierre Celis revived the Belgian style witbeer in 1965 in Hoegaarden then moved to Austin in 1991 to start the Celis Brewery where the iconic witbier was being brewed amongst all his other beers like Grand cru Tripel, Pale Bock and raspberry.  History  In 1966, Pierre Celis in Hoegaarden revived witbier, a regional beer style that had become extinct almost a decade earlier when the town's last brewery closed. Celis's first brewery was in his father's stable. In 1972, he relocated to an abandoned soft drink factory, and by 1985, he was brewing 300,000 barrels a year. His Hoegaarden Brewery burned to the ground that year, and Celis, who was under- insured, wound up selling his Hoegaarden brand to Belgian giant Interbrew. That company, now known as Anheuser-Busch InBev, continues to make Hoegaarden to this day. Celis White Celis, at the age of 67, founded a microbrewery in Austin in 1992. At a Brickskeller tasting, Celis, who spoke English haltingly, remarked that he chose Texas because its inhabitants speak with a slow drawl, making them easier to understand. Celis White received a perfect four-star rating from the British beer writer Michael Jackson in his Pocket Guide to Beer. . Celis Brewery made several other varieties of beer in addition to the celebrated White, including Dubbel, Grand Cru, Pale Bock, Pale Rider and Raspberry. at Wayback machine These types have been carried on by Michigan Brewing Company. Celis Brewery floundered after ownership was purchased by Miller Brewing Company, and the plant was shuttered on the final day of 2000. In 2002, Celis White and other brands were acquired by Michigan Brewing Company in Webberville, Michigan, which continued to produce until it closed in 2012. Pierre Celis died on April 9, 2011, at the age of 86. The Michigan Brewing Company was foreclosed upon and its assets sold at auction. Among the assets was the Celis name, which had been acquired by Bobby Mason for Michigan Brewing in 2002. Sushil Tyagi, of Craftbev International Inc. acquired the Celis brand. He said, \\"I have been building a brewery with the Celis family. We've already been building the distribution network. We're making all the plans for marketing and branding.

The modern dry cleaning process was developed and patented by Thomas L. Jennings. Dry cleaning still involves liquid but is so named because the term 'wet' is specific to water; clothes are instead soaked in a water-free liquid solvent, tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), known in the industry as \\"perc\\", which is the most widely used solvent. Alternative solvents are 1-bromopropane and petroleum spirits.David C. Tirsell \\"Dry Cleaning\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. Most natural fibers can be washed in water but some synthetics (e.g. viscose, lyocell, modal, and cupro) react poorly with water and must be dry-cleaned. History Thomas L. Jennings is the inventor and first to patent the commercial dry cleaning process known as \\"dry scouring\\", on March 3, 1821 (Patent Number: US 3,306X). He was the first African-American to be granted a patent of any kind, although there were attempts to prevent him; opponents claimed that the nature of the process was dangerous. An early adopter of commercial \\"dry laundry\\" using turpentine was Jolly Belin in Paris in 1825. Modern dry cleaning's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855. The potential for petroleum-based solvents was recognized by French dye-works operator Jean Baptiste Jolly, who offered a new service that became known as nettoyage √† sec‚Äîi.e., dry cleaning. Flammability concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop Stoddard solvent (white spirit) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions, resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners. After World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power. =Shift to tetrachloroethylene= By the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), or PCE for short, as the solvent. It has excellent cleaning power and is nonflammable and compatible with most garments. Because it is stable, tetrachloroethylene is readily recycled. =Infrastructure= Dry cleaning businesses, from the perspective of the customer, are either plants or drop shops. A plant does on-site cleaning. A drop shop receives garments from customers, sends them to a large plant, and then has the cleaned garment returned to the shop for collection by the customer. The turnaround time is longer for a drop shop than for a local plant. However, running a plant requires more work for the business owner. Since 2010, in some markets, web apps have been used to schedule low-cost home delivery for dry cleaning. This cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines‚Äîone for the cleaning process, and the second to remove the solvent from the garments. Machines of this era were described as vented; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere, the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts. This not only contributed to environmental contamination but also much potentially reusable PCE was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the Western world are now fully enclosed, and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled, so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically senses when all detectable traces of PCE have been removed. This system ensures that only small amounts of PCE fumes are released at the end of the cycle.  Mechanism  groups bind water, leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling, which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents. In terms of mechanism, dry cleaning selectively solubilizes stains on the article. The solvents are non-polar and tend to selectively extract compounds that cause stains. These stains would otherwise only dissolve in aqueous detergents mixtures at high temperatures, potentially damaging delicate fabrics. Non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics, especially natural fabrics, as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric. Water binds to these polar groups which results in the swelling and stretching of proteins within fibers during laundering. Also, the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber, resulting in the loss of the fiber's original shape. After the laundry cycle, water molecules will dry off. However, the original shape of the fibers has already been distorted and this commonly results in shrinkage. Non-polar solvents prevent this interaction, protecting more delicate fabrics. The usage of an effective solvent coupled with mechanical friction from tumbling effectively removes stains. Process 150x150px 189x189px A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer. Garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber (referred to as the 'basket' or 'drum'), which constitutes the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the garment load. The basket capacity is between about 10 and 40 kg (22 to 88 lb). During the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber (commonly known as the 'cage' or 'tackle box') is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage'. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit consisting of a boiler and condenser. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is roughly 8 liters of solvent per kilogram of garments per minute, depending on the size of the machine. Garments are also checked for foreign objects. Items such as plastic pens may dissolve in the solvent bath, damaging the textiles. Some textile dyes are \\"loose\\" and will shed dye during solvent immersion. Fragile items, such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings, may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag. The density of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm3 at room temperature (70% heavier than water), and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support. Not all stains can be removed by dry cleaning. Some need to be treated with spotting solvents ‚Äî sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain-remover liquids ‚Äî before garments are washed or dry cleaned. Also, garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture. A typical wash cycle lasts for 8‚Äì15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes 10‚Äì12 minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry cleaning surfactant \\"soap\\" may also be added. At the end of the wash cycle, the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank. This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty' working solvent. After the rinse cycle, the machine begins the extraction process, which recovers the solvent for reuse. Modern machines recover approximately 99.99% of the solvent employed. The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350‚Äì450 rpm, causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric. Until this time, the cleaning is done in normal temperature, as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process. When no more solvent can be spun out, the machine starts the drying cycle. During the drying cycle, the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air (60‚Äì63 ¬∞C/140‚Äì145 ¬∞F) that circulates through the basket, evaporating traces of solvent left after the spin cycle. The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments. The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank. Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated. This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution. In the early days of dry cleaning, large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless. Many dry cleaners place cleaned clothes inside thin clear plastic garment bags After the drying cycle is complete, a deodorizing (aeration) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent, by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins. After the aeration cycle, the garments are clean and ready for pressing and finishing. Solvent processing A Firbimatic Saver Series. This machine uses activated clay filtration instead of distillation. It uses much less energy than conventional methods. Working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a button trap, which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump. Over time, a thin layer of filter cake (called \\"muck\\") accumulates on the lint filter. The muck is removed regularly (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck. Many machines use \\"spin disk filters\\", which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent. After the lint filter, the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter. This filter, which contains activated clays and charcoal, removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues, along with dyes from the solvent. Finally, the solvent passes through a polishing filter, which removes any soil not previously removed. The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank. Cooked powder residue is the name for the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck. It will contain solvent, powdered filter material (diatomite), carbon, non-volatile residues, lint, dyes, grease, soils, and water. The waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent, water, soils, carbon, and other non- volatile residues. Used filters are another form of waste as is waste water. To enhance cleaning power, small amounts of detergent (0.5‚Äì1.5%) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality. These detergents emulsify hydrophobic soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments. Depending on the machine's design, either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used. Symbols The international GINETEX laundry symbol for dry cleaning is a circle. It may have the letter P inside it to indicate perchloroethylene solvent, or the letter F to indicate a flammable solvent (Feuergef√§hrliches Schwerbenzin). A bar underneath the circle indicates that only mild cleaning processes is recommended. A crossed-out empty circle indicates that dry cleaning is not permitted.

Solvents used =Perchloroethylene= Perchloroethylene (PCE, or tetrachloroethylene) has been in use since the 1930s. PCE is the most common solvent, the \\"standard\\" for cleaning performance. It is a highly effective cleaning solvent. It is thermally stable, recyclable, and has low toxicity. It can, however, cause color bleeding/loss, especially at higher temperatures. In some cases it may damage special trims, buttons, and beads on some garments. It is better for oil-based stains (which account for about 10% of stains) than more common water-soluble stains (coffee, wine, blood, etc.). The toxicity of tetrachloroethylene \\"is moderate to low\\" and \\"Reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing\\". = Hydrocarbons = Hydrocarbons are represented by products such as Exxon- Mobil's DF-2000 or Chevron Phillips' EcoSolv, and Pure Dry. These petroleum- based solvents are less aggressive but also less effective than PCE. Although combustible, risk of fire or explosion can be minimized when used properly. Hydrocarbons are however pollutants. Hydrocarbons retain about 10-12% of the market. A modern dry cleaning machine for use with various solvents = Trichloroethylene= Trichloroethylene is more aggressive than PCE but is very rarely used. With superior degreasing properties, it was often used for industrial workwear/overalls cleaning in the past. TCE is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.EPA Releases Final Health Assessment for TCE September 2011. Accessed 2011-09-28. =Supercritical CO2= Supercritical CO2 is an alternative to PCE; however, it is inferior in removing some forms of grime. Additive surfactants improve the efficacy of CO2. Carbon dioxide is almost entirely nontoxic. The greenhouse gas potential is also lower than that of many organic solvents. Consumer Reports rated supercritical CO2 superior to conventional methods, but the Drycleaning and Laundry Institute commented on its \\"fairly low cleaning ability\\" in a 2007 report.Drycleaning and Laundry Institute. \\"The DLI White Paper: Key Information on Industry Solvents.\\" The Western Cleaner & Launderer, August 2007. Supercritical CO2 is, overall, a mild solvent which lowers its ability to aggressively attack stains. One deficiency with supercritical CO2 is that its electrical conductivity is low. As mentioned in the Mechanisms section, dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains. When solvent interacts with the fabric's surface, the friction dislocates dirt. At the same time, the friction also builds up an electrical charge. Fabrics are very poor conductors and so usually, this build-up is discharged through the solvent. This discharge does not occur in liquid carbon dioxide and the build-up of an electrical charge on the surface of the fabric attracts the dirt back on to the surface, which diminishes its cleaning efficiency. To compensate for the poor solubility and conductivity of supercritical carbon dioxide, research has focused on additives. For increased solubility, 2-propanol has shown increased cleaning effects for liquid carbon dioxide as it increases the ability of the solvent to dissolve polar compounds. Machinery for use of supercritical CO2 is expensive‚Äîup to $90,000 more than a PCE machine, making affordability difficult for small businesses. Some cleaners with these machines keep traditional machines on-site for more heavily soiled textiles, but others find plant enzymes to be equally effective and more environmentally sustainable. =Other solvents: niche, emerging, etc.= For decades, efforts have been made to replace PCE. These alternatives have not proven economical thus far: * Stoddard solvent ‚Äì flammable and explosive, 100 ¬∞F/38 ¬∞C flash point * CFC-113 (Freon-113), a CFC. Now banned as ozone-unfriendly. *Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (\\"liquid silicone\\"), called D5 for short. It was popularized by GreenEarth Cleaning. It is more expensive than PCE. It degrades within days in the environment. *Dibutoxymethane (SolvonK4) is a bipolar solvent that removes water-based stains and oil-based stains. *Brominated solvents (n-propyl bromide, Fabrisolv, DrySolv) are solvents with higher KB-values than PCE. This allows faster cleaning, but can damage some synthetic beads and sequins if not used correctly. Healthwise, there are reported risks associated with nPB such as numbness of nerves.\\"HAZARD EVALUATION 1-Bromopropane\\" July 2003. Accessed 2014-Jan-22 The exposure to the solvents in a typical dry cleaner is considered far below the levels required to cause any risk. Environmentally, it is approved by the U.S. EPA. It is among the more expensive solvents, but it is faster cleaning, lower temperatures, and quick dry times.

Adderley is remembered for his 1966 soul jazz single \\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\\", written by Joe Zawinul and also a major crossover hit on the pop charts (it was covered by the Buckinghams). He worked with trumpeter Miles Davis, on his own 1958 Somethin' Else album, and on the seminal Davis records Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959). He was the elder brother of jazz trumpeter Nat Adderley, a longtime member of his band. Early life and career Originally from Tampa, Florida, Adderley moved to New York in 1955. His nickname derived from \\"cannibal\\", a title imposed on him by high school colleagues as a tribute to his voracious appetite. Cannonball moved to Tallahassee, when his parents obtained teaching positions at Florida A&M; University. Both Cannonball and brother Nat played with Ray Charles when Charles lived in Tallahassee during the early 1940s.Lydon, Michael, Ray Charles: Man and Music, Routledge (1996); updated edition, January 22, 2004, . Adderley moved to Broward County, Florida, in 1948 after finishing his music studies at Florida A&M; and became the band director at Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale, a position which he held until 1950. Cannonball left Southeast Florida and moved to New York City in 1955. One of his known addresses in New York was in the neighborhood of Corona, Queens.Berman, Eleanor. \\"The jazz of Queens encompasses music royalty\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 1, 2006. Accessed October 1, 2009. \\"When the trolley tour proceeds, Mr. Knight points out the nearby Dorie Miller Houses, a co-op apartment complex in Corona where Clark Terry and Cannonball and Nat Adderley lived and where saxophonist Jimmy Heath still resides.\\" He left Florida originally to seek graduate studies at New York conservatories, but one night in 1955 he brought his saxophone with him to the Caf√© Bohemia. Cannonball was asked to sit in with Oscar Pettiford in place of his band's regular saxophonist, who was late for the gig. The \\"buzz\\" on the New York jazz scene after Adderley's performance announced him as the heir to the mantle of Charlie Parker. Adderley formed his own group with his brother Nat after signing onto the Savoy jazz label in 1957. He was noticed by Miles Davis, and it was because of his blues-rooted alto saxophone that Davis asked him to play with his group. He joined the Davis band in October 1957, three months prior to the return of John Coltrane to the group. Some of Davis's finest trumpet work can be found on Adderley's solo album Somethin' Else (also featuring Art Blakey and Hank Jones), which was recorded shortly after the two giants met. Adderley then played on the seminal Davis records Milestones and Kind of Blue. This period also overlapped with pianist Bill Evans' time with the sextet, an association that led to recording Portrait of Cannonball and Know What I Mean?. His interest as an educator carried over to his recordings. In 1961, Cannonball narrated The Child's Introduction to Jazz, released on Riverside Records. In 1962, Cannonball married actress Olga James. Band leader The Cannonball Adderley Quintet featured Cannonball on alto sax and his brother Nat Adderley on cornet. Cannonball's first quintet was not very successful;Milkowski, Bill, \\"Junior Mance: Saved By A Cannonball\\", JazzTimes, January 16, 2012. however, after leaving Davis' group, he formed another group again with his brother. The new quintet, which later became the Cannonball Adderley Sextet, and Cannonball's other combos and groups, included such noted musicians as saxophonists Charles Lloyd and Yusef Lateef, pianists Bobby Timmons, Barry Harris, Victor Feldman, Joe Zawinul, Hal Galper, Michael Wolff, and George Duke, bassists Ray Brown, Sam Jones, Walter Booker, and Victor Gaskin, and drummers Louis Hayes and Roy McCurdy. Later life Nat and Cannonball Adderley in Amsterdam, 1961 By the end of the 1960s, Adderley's playing began to reflect the influence of electric jazz. In this period, he released albums such as Accent on Africa (1968) and The Price You Got to Pay to Be Free (1970). In that same year, his quintet appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival in California, and a brief scene of that performance was featured in the 1971 psychological thriller Play Misty for Me, starring Clint Eastwood. In 1975 he also appeared in an acting role alongside Jos√© Feliciano and David Carradine in the episode \\"Battle Hymn\\" in the third season of the TV series Kung Fu. Songs made famous by Adderley and his bands include \\"This Here\\" (written by Bobby Timmons), \\"The Jive Samba\\", \\"Work Song\\" (written by Nat Adderley), \\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\\" (written by Joe Zawinul) and \\"Walk Tall\\" (written by Zawinul, Marrow, and Rein). A cover version of Pops Staples' \\"Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?\\" also entered the charts. His instrumental \\"Sack o' Woe\\" was arranged by Herbie Mann on their debut album. In July, 1975 Adderley suffered a stroke from a cerebral hemorrhage and died four weeks later, on August 8, 1975, at St. Mary Mercy Medical Center in Gary, Indiana. He was 46 years old. He was survived by his wife Olga James Adderley, parents Julian C. and Jessie L. Adderley, and brother Nat Adderley. He was buried in the Southside Cemetery, Tallahassee. Legacy Later that year he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. Joe Zawinul's composition \\"Cannon Ball\\" on Weather Report's Black Market album is a tribute to his former leader. Pepper Adams and George Mraz dedicated the composition \\"Julian\\" on the 1975 Pepper Adams album of the same name days after Cannonball's death. Adderley was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity (Gamma Theta chapter, University of North Texas, '60, & Xi Omega chapter, Frostburg State University, '70) and Alpha Phi Alpha (Beta Nu chapter, Florida A&M; University).

Gloves usually have separate sheaths or openings for each finger and the thumb. If there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one small opening rather than individual openings for each finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than other styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact with each other; reduced surface area reduces heat loss. A hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by Velcro or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or glittens, a combination of \\"glove\\" and \\"mittens\\". Gloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, abrasion or chemicals, and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.James W.H. McCord and Sandra L. McCord, Criminal Law and Procedure for the paralegal: a systems approach, supra, p. 127. Fingerless gloves are useful where dexterity is required that gloves would restrict. Cigarette smokers and church organists often use fingerless gloves. Some gloves include a gauntlet that extends partway up the arm. Cycling gloves for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players often use fingerless gloves in circumstances where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand. Gloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or felted wool, leather, rubber, latex, neoprene, silk, and metal (as in mail). Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits such as the Apollo/Skylab A7L which went to the Moon. Spacesuit gloves combine toughness and environmental protection with a degree of sensitivity and flexibility. History Minoan youths boxing, Knossos fresco. One of the earliest documented uses of gloves. Gloves appear to be of great antiquity. According to some translations of Homer's The Odyssey, La√´rtes is described as wearing gloves while walking in his garden so as to avoid the brambles.\\"Gloves.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (Other translations, however, insist that Laertes pulled his long sleeves over his hands.) Herodotus, in The History of Herodotus (440 BC), tells how Leotychides was incriminated by a glove (gauntlet) full of silver that he received as a bribe. There are occasional references to the use of gloves among the Romans as well. Pliny the Younger (c. 100), his uncle's shorthand writer wore gloves in winter so as not to impede the elder Pliny's work. A gauntlet, which could be a glove made of leather or some kind of metal armour, was a strategic part of a soldier's defense throughout the Middle Ages, but the advent of firearms made hand-to- hand combat rare. As a result, the need for gauntlets disappeared. During the 13th century, gloves began to be worn by ladies as a fashion ornament. They were made of linen and silk, and sometimes reached to the elbow. Such worldly accoutrements were not for holy women, according to the early 13th century Ancrene Wisse, written for their guidance.J. R. R. Tolkien, ed. Ancrene Wisse, 8. The English Text of the Ancrene Riwle: Ancrene Wisse (Early English Text Society, CCXLIX) London 1962, noted by Diane Bornstein, The Lady in the Tower (Hamden, Connecticut) 1983:25 note 4. Sumptuary laws were promulgated to restrain this vanity: against samite gloves in Bologna, 1294, against perfumed gloves in Rome, 1560.Marjorie O'Rourke Boyle, \\"Coquette at the Cross? Magdalen in the Master of the Bartholomew Altar's Deposition at the Louvre\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, 59.4 (1996:573‚Äì577) assembles numerous historical references to gloves, with bibliography. A Paris corporation or guild of glovers (gantiers) existed from the thirteenth century. They made them in skin or in fur.√âtienne-Martin Saint-L√©on, Histoire des corporation de m√©tiers depuis leurs origines jusqu'√† leur suppression en 1791 (Paris) 1922, noted by Boyle 1996:174:10. By 1440, in England glovers had become members of the Dubbers or Bookbinders Guild until they formed their own guild during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Glovers' Company was incorporated in 1613. It was not until the 16th century that gloves reached their greatest elaboration; however, when Queen Elizabeth I set the fashion for wearing them richly embroidered and jewelled, and for putting them on and taking them off during audiences, to draw attention to her beautiful hands.Roy C. Strong, Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I (Oxford) 1963:18f. The 1592 \\"Ditchley\\" portrait of her features her holding leather gloves in her left hand. In Paris, the gantiers became gantiers parfumeurs, for the scented oils, musk, ambergris and civet, that perfumed leather gloves, but their trade, which was an introduction at the court of Catherine de Medici,Charles VIII of France received some gloves that were scented with powder of violet, but they were not of French making (Boyle 1996:174). was not specifically recognised until 1656, in a royal brevet. Makers of knitted gloves, which did not retain perfume and had less social cachet, were organised in a separate guild, of bonnetiersIn the earliest usage, bonnet was the woolen thread worked by hand with the needle or a spindle (Boyle 1996:174). who might knit silk as well as wool. Such workers were already organised in the fourteenth century. Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning.Boyle 1996:174 In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable. The craze for gloves called \\"limericks\\" took hold. This particular fad was the product of a manufacturer in Limerick, Ireland, who fashioned the gloves from the skin of unborn calves.Jenkins, Jessica Kerwin, The Encyclopedia of the Exquisite, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, p. 85 Embroidered and jeweled gloves formed part of the insignia of emperors and kings. Thus Matthew of Paris, in recording the burial of Henry II of England in 1189, mentions that he was buried in his coronation robes with a golden crown on his head and gloves on his hands. Gloves were found on the hands of King John when his tomb was opened in 1797 and on those of King Edward I when his tomb was opened in 1774. Pontifical gloves are liturgical ornaments used primarily by the pope, the cardinals, and bishops. They may be worn only at the celebration of mass. The liturgical use of gloves has not been traced beyond the beginning of the 10th century, and their introduction may have been due to a simple desire to keep the hands clean for the holy mysteries, but others suggest that they were adopted as part of the increasing pomp with which the Carolingian bishops were surrounding themselves. From the Frankish kingdom the custom spread to Rome, where liturgical gloves are first heard of in the earlier half of the 11th century. Portrait of Mme. Paulin wearing gloves, Pierre Auguste Renoir A glove commemorating the visit of General Lafayette to the United States in 1824. When short sleeves came into fashion in the 1700s, women began to wear long gloves, reaching halfway up the forearm. By the 1870s, buttoned kid, silk, or velvet gloves were worn with evening or dinner dress, and long suede gloves were worn during the day and when having tea. Mainly during the 19th century, the generic or trade name \\"Berlin gloves\\" was used for washable, thin white cotton gloves often worn by servants, such as butlers or waiters, and the less well-off in civilian life. The term was also used for white cotton gloves worn with the dress uniform by the American military in the First World War. In 1905, The Law Times made one of the first references to the use of gloves by criminals to hide fingerprints, stating: For the future... when the burglar goes a-burgling, a pair of gloves will form a necessary part of his outfit. Early Formula One race cars used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of driving gloves.Formula One retrieved on 02/01/2011 Disposable latex gloves were developed by the Australian company Ansell. Tommie Smith and John Carlos held up their leather glove-clad fists at the awards ceremony of the 1968 Summer Olympics. Their actions were intended to symbolize Black Power. They were banned from the Olympics for life as a result of the incident. Yet another of the more infamous episodes involving a leather glove came during the 1995 O.J. Simpson murder case in which Simpson demonstrated that the glove purportedly used in the alleged murder was too small to fit his hand.

Satin and stretch satin are popular and mass-produced. Some women wear gloves as part of \\"dressy\\" outfits, such as for church and weddings. Long white gloves are common accessories for teenage girls attending formal events such as prom, quincea√±era, cotillion, or formal ceremonies at church, such as confirmation. In Japan, white gloves are worn frequently. Work-oriented white gloves are worn for activities such as gardening and cleanup; \\"dress\\" white gloves are worn by professionals who want a clean public appearance, such as taxi drivers, police, politicians and elevator operators. However white gloves are not recommended for touching old books and similar antiquities.http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/collectioncare/publications/videos/whitegloves.pdfhttp://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/uspace/id/5214/filename/3997.pdf Fingerless gloves Leather fingerless gloves Fingerless gloves or \\"glovelettes\\" are garments worn on the hands which resemble regular gloves in most ways, except that the finger columns are half-length and opened, allowing the top-half of the wearer's fingers to be shown. Fingerless gloves are often padded in the palm area, to provide protection to the hand, and the exposed fingers do not interfere with sensation or gripping. In contrast to traditional full gloves, often worn for warmth, fingerless gloves will often have a ventilated back to allow the hands to cool; this is commonly seen in weightlifting gloves. Fingerless gloves are worn by motorcyclists to better grip the handlebars, as well as by skateboarders and rollerbladers, to protect the palms of the hands and add grip in the event of a fall. Some anglers, particularly fly fishermen, favour fingerless gloves to allow manipulation of line and tackle in cooler conditions. Fingerless gloves are common among marching band members, particularly those who play the clarinet or open-hole flute, due to the difficulty of covering small holes whilst wearing gloves. The lack of fabric on the fingertips allows for better use of touchscreens, as on smartphones and tablet computers. Professional MMA fighters are required to wear fingerless gloves in fights. Leather gloves Motorcyle riding gloves, gray deerskin, some points reinforced Lined black leather gloves with red leather fourchettes A leather glove is a fitted covering for the hand with a separate sheath for each finger and the thumb. This covering is composed of the tanned hide of an animal (with the hair removed), though in recent years it is more common for the leather to be synthetic. =Common uses= Leather gloves have been worn by people for thousands of years. The unique properties of leather allow for both a comfortable fit and useful grip for the wearer. The grain present on the leather and the pores present in the leather gives the gloves the unique ability to assist the wearer as they grip an object. As soft as a leather glove may be, its pores and grain provide a level of friction when \\"gripped\\" against an item or surface. A common use for leather gloves is sporting events. In baseball, a baseball glove is an oversized leather glove with a web used for fielding the ball. Leather gloves are also used in handball, cycling, and American football. Early Formula One racing drivers used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of driving gloves. Leather gloves provide protection from occupational hazards. For example, beekeepers use leather gloves to avoid being stung by bees. Construction workers might use leather gloves for added grip and for protecting their hands. Welders use gloves too for protection against electrical shocks, extreme heat, ultraviolet and infrared. Criminals have been known to wear leather gloves during the commission of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present on the surface of the leather. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Investigators are able to dust for the glove prints left behind from the leather the same way in which they dust for fingerprints. =Leather dress gloves= Main types of gloving leather Leather is a natural product with special characteristics that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it is a natural product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on certain parts of the palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists. Because the leather is natural as well as delicate, the wearer must take precaution as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running nose with a gloved hand. Leather dress gloves that are worn very tight and possess very short, elasticized wrists, are most often referred to as cop gloves or law enforcement gloves because of their prevalence as issued duty gloves for many law enforcement agencies. It is common attire in leather subculture and BDSM communities. * Lambskin is widely used for fashion gloves and it is casual and country gloves. It is the most used material for gloves made in Europe in the known as French style.. * Cowhide is often used for lower-priced gloves. This leather is generally considered too thick and bulky for the majority of glove styles, particularly finer dress gloves. It is, however, used for some casual styles of glove. * Deerskin has the benefit of great strength and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than \\"hairsheep\\". It is very hard-wearing and heavier in weight. * Goatskin is occasionally used for gloves. It is hard-wearing but coarser than other leathers and is normally used for cheaper gloves. * Hairsheep originates from sheep that grow hair, not wool. Hairsheep leather is finer and less bulky than other leathers. Its major benefits are softness of touch, suppleness, strength, and lasting comfort. It is very durable and is particularly suited for the manufacture of dress gloves. * Peccary is the world‚Äôs rarest and most luxurious gloving leather. Peccary leather is very soft, difficult to sew, and hard-wearing.Chambers, Helen G., and Verna Moulton. Clothing Selection: Fashions, Figures, Fabrics. Page 349. Literary Licensing, Whitefish, United States. 1961. , 9781258228170. * Sheepskin, also called shearling, is widely used for casual and country gloves. It is very warm in cold weather, and as a leather reversed, it has still attached wool on the inside. * Slink lamb is used only in the most expensive lambskin gloves. Some of the finest lambskin comes from New Zealand. =Leather glove linings= * Cashmere is warm, light in weight, and very comfortable to wear. Cashmere yarn comes from the hair of mountain goats, whose fleece allows them to survive the extreme weather conditions they are exposed to. * Silk is warm in winter and cool in summer and is used both in men's and women's gloves, but is more popular in women's. * Wool is well known for its natural warmth and comfort, as well as having a natural elasticity. * Other linings, which include wool mixtures and acrylics. Component parts The component parts that may be found in a leather dress glove are one pair of tranks, one pair of thumbs, four whole fourchettes, four half fourchettes, two gussets, and six quirks. Depending on the style of the glove there may also be roller pieces, straps, rollers, eyelets, studs, sockets and domes. Finally, linings will themselves consist of tranks, thumbs and fourchettes. Stitching The most popular types of leather glove sewing stitches used today are: * Hand stitched, which is most popular in men's gloves and some women's styles. Hand stitching is a very time-consuming and skilled process. * Inseam, which is mainly used on women's gloves, but occasionally on men's dress gloves. Some glove terms * Button length is the measurement in inches that is used to determine the length/measurement from the base of the glove thumb to the cuff of the glove. * Fourchettes are the inside panels on the fingers of some glove styles. * Perforations are small holes that are punched in the leather. They are often added for better ventilation, grip, or aesthetics and can be as fine as a pin hole. * Points are the three, or sometimes single, line of decorative stitching on the back of the glove. * Quirks are found on only the most expensive hand sewn gloves. They are small diamond shaped pieces of leather sewn at the base of the fingers, where they are attached to the hand of the glove to improve the fit. * A strap and roller is used to adjust the closeness of the fit around the wrist. * A Vent is the 'V' shaped cut out of the glove, sometimes at the back, but more often on the palm, to give the glove an easier fit around the wrist. =Driving gloves= Rick Mastracchio's damaged glove during STS-118 Driving gloves are designed for holding a steering wheel and transmitting the feeling of the road to the driver. They provide a good feel and protect the hands. They are designed to be worn tight and to not interfere with hand movements. The increased grip allows for more control and increased safety at speed.Knowledge Center Retrieved on 02/01/2011 True driver‚Äôs gloves offer tactile advantages to drivers frequently handling a car near the limits of adhesion. Made of soft leather, drivers gloves are unlined with external seams. Mittens Saami mittens Gloves which cover the entire hand but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Generally, mittens still separate the thumb from the other four fingers. They have different colours and designs. Mittens have a higher thermal efficiency than gloves as they have a smaller surface area exposed to the cold. The earliest mittens known to archeologists date to around 1000 A.D. in Latvia. Mittens continue to be part of Latvian national costume today. Wool biodegrades quickly, so it is likely that earlier mittens, possibly in other countries, may have existed but were not preserved. An exception is the specimen found during the excavations of the Early Medieval trading town of Dorestad in the Netherlands. In the harbour area a mitten of wool was discovered dating from the 8th or early 9th century.Brandenburgh, Chr., 'Textile production and trade in Dorestad', Willemsen, A. & Kik, H. (reds.), Dorestad in an international framework. New research on centres of trade and coinage in Carolingian times (Turnhout 2010), 83‚Äì88. Many people around the Arctic Circle have used mittens, including other Baltic peoples, Native Americans and Vikings. Mittens are a common sight on ski slopes, as they not only provide extra warmth but extra protection from injury. Idiot mittens are two mittens connected by a length of yarn, string or lace, threaded through the sleeves of a coat. This arrangement is typically provided for small children to prevent the mittens becoming discarded and lost; when removed, the mittens simply dangle from the string just beyond the cuff of the sleeve. Hybrid glove / mitten Gunner's Mittens ‚Äì In the 1930s, special fingerless mittens were introduced that have a flap located in the palm of the mitten so a hunter or soldier could have his finger free to fire his weapon. Originally developed for hunters in the frigid zones of the US and Canada, eventually most military organizations copied them. Scratch mitts do not separate the thumb, and are designed to prevent babieswho do not yet have fine motor controlfrom scratching their faces. Ergonomic design Safety standards Several European standards relate to gloves. These include: Antivibration protective gloves. * EN 388: Protective against mechanical risks (abrasion / cut / tear / puncture) * EN 374: Protective against chemical and microorganisms * EN 420: General requirements for gloves includes sizing and a number of health and safety aspects including latex protein and chromium levels. * EN 60903: Electric shock * EN 407: Heat resistance * EN 511: Cold resistance * EN 1149: Antistatic * EN 10819: Anti Vibration gloves (TRM ‚Äì Transmission Ratio Medium frequency range, TRH ‚Äì Transmission Ratio High frequency range) These exist to fulfill Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. PPE places gloves into three categories: * Minimal risk ‚Äì End user can easily identify risk. Risk is low. * Complex design ‚Äì Used in situations that can cause serious injury or death. * Intermediate ‚Äì Gloves that don't fit into minimal risk or complex design categories. Noted gloves Michael Jackson's glove Michael Jackson often wore a single jeweled glove on his right hand, which helped develop his signature look. It has been the object of several auctions. A dark leather glove became an important piece of evidence in the O. J. Simpson murder case. Simpson's defense counsel famously quipped \\"if it doesn't fit, you must acquit\\". The glove presented as evidence shrank from having been soaked in blood, according to some analysis.

Vigoreaux was considered a pioneer in the television business in Puerto Rico, and enjoyed success with several radio and television shows throughout his career. Vigoreaux was brutally murdered on January 17, 1983. His wife, Lydia Echevarr√≠a, was convicted in 1986 of planning the murder, along with hitmen Papo Newman and David L√≥pez-Watts. Early years Vigoreaux was born on April 12, 1928 in the Chupacallos ward of Ceiba, Puerto Rico. He was one of the eight children of Eulalia and Enrique Vigoreaux, a sugarcane worker at Fajardo Sugar Company. His father died when he was young, forcing Eulalia to take charge of the family. When Vigoreaux was 14 years old, they moved to San Juan, specifically R√≠o Piedras. Vigoreaux studied at the Vila Mayo High School. As a teenager, Vigoreaux found work in a radio station named WIAC (AM), which was managed by Tom√°s Mu√±iz (father of Tommy Mu√±iz). There, Vigoreaux worked on a show called Alma Estudiantil. With the beginning of World War II, most of the professional hosts were enlisted for war, which led to Vigoreaux having the opportunity to work at the station. During that period, Vigoreaux worked in various areas of entertainment and show business. He served as host, presenter, commentator, among other jobs. He also became the spokesperson for Sello Rojo rice in Puerto Rico, which he did for 30 years. First years in comedy Vigoreaux joined Ram√≥n Rivero \\"Diplo\\" and Jos√© Luis Torregrosa for the radio comedy El Tremendo Hotel. This radio slot enjoyed a large audience for years, and Vigoreaux continued to work as a comedian. Between 1954 and 1955, he joined fellow comedian Jos√© Miguel Agrelot in a theater show that took them to many Latin American communities in the United States. The theater show eventually led to a radio program named Torito and Company, after Torito, the character that Agrelot played. Vigoreaux himself played the character of Don Toribio. Arrival of television With the arrival of television to Puerto Rico in 1954, Vigoreaux began his transition hosting a show called El Show Libby's, sponsored by the company of its namesake. He then hosted the show El tren de la alegr√≠a. Vigoreaux later moved to WAPA-TV, motivated by the possibility of working with actor Mario Pab√≥n. They wrote the story for a soap opera, but the project fell through. However, Vigoreaux moved on when he and his second wife, Lydia Echevarria, began hosting the show named La Hora Cero. The show presented many local and international singers, including Celia Cruz, Jos√© Feliciano and Marco Antonio Mu√±iz. Success in television The Vigoreaux family became one of the most famous families in Puerto Rico. Some even referred to the Vigoreaux-Echevarria couple as the Lucy and Desi of Puerto Rico, in reference to the marriage of American comedians Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. In 1970, Vigoreaux developed a game show named Sube Nene, Sube. Hosted by Vigoreaux it became one of the most seen shows in Puerto Rican television history. Due to this success, WAPA-TV asked Vigoreaux to produce and host a few more game shows. Vigoreaux responded by creating Pa'rriba, Papi, Pa'rriba, which was a variation of Sube Nene, Sube, and Dale que Dale en Domingo. With the production and hosting of all those shows at the same time, the Vigoreaux family opened a studio, which they named Estudio CVC. They were also responsible for the transmission of the MDA television marathon in Puerto Rico. Brief change to Channel 11 and return to WAPA Vigoreaux later jumped to Channel 11, then named the Perez-Perry Network. He bought the Teatro Nuevo San Juan, from where he started transmitting his new show. But this show was not as successful, and soon Vigoreaux found himself off the air. In 1980, Vigoreaux went back to WAPA-TV and all his shows were rescheduled. He also became the show host of that station's lunch hour variety show, El Show Del Mediodia, and began playing the role of Pedro Navaja in a play La Verdadera Historia de Pedro Navaja. He would act in that play many times, as well as in a play named Angeles Caidos. In addition, he returned to the radio with a program named Buenos Dias, Puerto Rico, on radio station WBMJ-AM, Radio Rock, and worked, for a short period of time, as a television reporter for Noticentro 4. Murder and aftermath On the morning of January 18, 1983, Vigoreaux didn't show up to work at the radio station or at WAPA-TV, causing his co-workers to worry. When his Mercedes-Benz was found with a burned body inside, it was taken to the medical examiner's office, where it was confirmed it was Vigoreaux. His death launched a wave of rumors and speculations, and led to one of the biggest trials in Puerto Rico's history. His wife, Lydia Echevarr√≠a, was accused formally of his murder, along with Papo Newman and David L√≥pez-Watts. Allegedly, Echevarr√≠a had become jealous of a relationship Vigoreaux had started with actress Nydia Castillo, and had paid Newman and L√≥pez-Watts to either beat him or murder him. Vigoreaux's body was found gagged, stabbed, and burned inside the car's trunk. Echevarr√≠a has maintained her innocence, but she was convicted to a life sentence in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. Newman and L√≥pez-Watts received similar sentences. However, Echevarr√≠a and L√≥pez-Watts only served roughly 12 years in jail. Papo Newman received immunity from the Department of Justice of Puerto Rico to testify in court what happened the night of the murder. Newman did not serve time in prison as an agreement. In January 2000, Governor Pedro Rossell√≥ granted Echevarr√≠a a pardon, which was largely criticized by the people. At the time of his death, Vigoreaux was about to begin another game show, A Mill√≥n, which eventually became one of the most popular shows in Puerto Rican television history, under the hosting of Hector Marcano and produced by Vigoreaux's son, Luisito Vigoreaux. Personal life Vigoreaux was married twice. He married Rosaura Lorenzana, with whom he had three sons, Luisito, Jorge Enrique and Roberto Vigoreaux. Jorge died in 1962 of leukemia. Luisito has followed his father's footsteps as an actor, comedian, producer, and host. Roberto also worked as an actor, host, producer, and singer. He also served as a member of both the House and the Senate of Puerto Rico. In 1958, Vigoreaux met actress Lydia Echevarr√≠a, while still married to his first wife. After divorcing, they married on February 10, 1960. He and Echevarria had two daughters, Vanessa and Glendalys Vigoreaux. Glendalys committed suicide on July 15, 2008.

He was Seigneur of Sark from 1715 to 1720 when he sold the fief. He held (in absentia) the office of Bailiff of Jersey from 1715 to 1763. Origins He was the son and heir of George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (1667‚Äì1695), by his wife Lady Grace Granville (c. 1677‚Äì1744), suo jure 1st Countess Granville, 3rd daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628‚Äì1701) of Stowe House in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall. The progeny of this marriage, Barons Carteret, Earls Granville, and Marquesses of Bath (Thynne), were co-heirs to her childless nephew William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692‚Äì1711). The family of Carteret was settled in the Channel Islands, and was of Norman descent. Early life John Carteret was educated at Westminster School, and at Christ Church, Oxford. Jonathan Swift said that \\"with a singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more Greek, Latin and philosophy than properly became a person of his rank\\". Throughout his life Carteret not only showed a keen love of the classics, but a taste for and knowledge of modern languages and literature. He was almost the only English nobleman of his time who spoke German, which allowed him to talk with and gain the trust ofBrowning p.117 King George I, who spoke no English. Walter Harte, the author of the Life of Gustavus Adolphus, acknowledged the aid which Carteret had given him. On 17 October 1710 Carteret married Lady Frances Worsley at Longleat House. She was the granddaughter of the first Viscount Weymouth. One of their daughters, Georgiana Caroline Carteret Spencer, became the grandmother of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Upon reaching his majority of 21, Lord Carteret took his seat in the House of Lords on 25 May 1711. Although his family, on both sides, had been devoted to the Jacobite cause, Carteret was a steady adherent of the Hanoverian dynasty which supplanted them. He was a friend of the Whig leaders Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and supported the passing of the Septennial Act. Diplomat Carteret's interests were in foreign, not domestic, policy. His serious work in public life began with his appointment, early in 1719, as Ambassador to Sweden. During this and the following year he was employed in saving Sweden from the attacks of Peter the Great, and in arranging the pacification of the north. His efforts were finally successful. During this period of diplomatic work he acquired an exceptional knowledge of the affairs of Europe, and in particular of Germany, and displayed great tact and temper in dealing with the Swedish senate, with Queen Ulrica, with King Frederik IV of Denmark and King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia. But he was not qualified to hold his own in the intrigues of Court and Parliament in London. Appointed as Secretary of State for the Southern Department on his return home, he soon came into conflict with the intrigues of Townshend and Sir Robert Walpole. Rivalry with Walpole To Walpole, who looked upon every able colleague or subordinate as an enemy to be removed, Carteret was exceptionally odious. His capacity to speak German with the King would alone have made Sir Robert detest him. When, therefore, the violent agitation in Ireland against Wood's halfpence made it necessary to replace the Duke of Grafton as Lord Lieutenant, Carteret was sent to Dublin, where he landed on 23 October 1724 and remained until 1730. In the first months of his tenure of office he had to deal with the furious opposition to Wood's halfpence, and to counteract the effect of Swift's Drapier's Letters. Carteret had a strong personal liking for Swift, who was also a friend of his wife's family. It is highly doubtful whether Carteret could have reconciled his duty to the crown with his private friendships, if government had persisted in endeavouring to force the detested coinage on the Irish people. Wood's patent was however withdrawn, and Ireland settled down. Carteret was a profuse and popular Lord Lieutenant who pleased both the English interest and the native Irish. He was at all times addicted to lavish hospitality and, according to the testimony of contemporaries, was \\"too fond of burgundy\\".Rachel Wilson, ‚ÄòThe Vicereines of Ireland and the Transformation of the Dublin Court, c. 1703‚Äì1737‚Äô in The Court Historian, xix, no. 1 (2014). Americas Carteret had inherited a one-eighth share in the Province of Carolina through his great-grandfather Sir George Carteret. In 1727 and 1728 John learned that the owners of the remaining shares were planning to sell them back to the crown. Carteret declined to join them. In 1729 the others surrendered their claims, but in 1730 Carteret, in order to keep ownership of his stake, agreed to give up any participation in government. His share was later defined as a 60-mile wide strip of land in North Carolina adjoining the Virginia boundary, and became known as the Granville District. The lands of the Granville District remained a possession of the Carteret family until the death of Carteret's son Robert in 1776. Following the American War of Independence, Robert's heirs were compensated in part by the Crown for the loss of the lands. Queen Caroline When Carteret returned to London in 1730, Walpole was firmly in charge of the House of Commons and as the trusted Minister of King George II. Walpole also had the full confidence of Queen Caroline, whom he prejudiced against Carteret. Until the fall of Walpole in 1742, Carteret could take no share in public affairs except as a leader of opposition in the House of Lords. His brilliant parts were somewhat obscured by his rather erratic conduct, and a certain contempt, partly aristocratic and partly intellectual, for commonplace men and ways. He endeavoured to please Queen Caroline, who loved literature, and he has the credit of having paid the expenses of the first handsome edition of Don Quixote to please her. He also involved himself in the establishment of the Foundling Hospital, a charity championed by the Queen, for which he became a founding governor. But he reluctantly, and most unwisely, allowed himself to be entangled in the scandalous family quarrel between Frederick, Prince of Wales and his parents. Queen Caroline was provoked into classing Carteret and Bolingbroke as \\"the two most worthless men of parts in the country\\". Secretary of State Carteret took the popular side in the outcry against Walpole for not declaring war on Spain. When the War of the Austrian Succession approached, his sympathies were entirely with Maria Theresa of Austria, mainly on the ground that the fall of the house of Austria would dangerously increase the power of France, even if she gained no accession of territory. These views made him welcome to George II, who gladly accepted him as Secretary of State in 1742. In 1743 he accompanied the King to Germany, and was present at the Battle of Dettingen on 27 June 1743. He held the secretary- ship until November 1744. Carteret succeeded in promoting an agreement between Maria Theresa and Frederick II of Prussia. He understood the relations of the European states, and the interests of Great Britain among them. But the defects which had rendered him unable to baffle the intrigues of Walpole made him equally unable to contend with the Pelhams (Henry Pelham and his elder brother Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, successive Prime Ministers). His support of the King's policy was denounced as subservience to Hanover. Pitt called him \\"an execrable, a sole minister who had renounced the British nation\\". A few years later Pitt adopted an identical policy, and professed that whatever he knew he had learnt from Carteret. Earl Granville On 18 October 1744 Carteret became 2nd Earl Granville on the death of his mother. His first wife Lady Frances Worsley died on 20 June 1743 at Hanover, and in April 1744 he married Lady Sophia Fermor, a daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret, a fashionable beauty and \\"reigning toast\\" of London society, who was younger than his daughters. Granville's ostentatious performance of the part of lover was ridiculed by Horace Walpole as \\"The nuptials of our great Quixote and the fair Sophia\\" and \\"My lord stayed with her there till four in the morning. They are all fondnesswalk together, and stop every five steps to kiss.\\" The Countess Granville died on 7 October 1745, leaving one daughter Sophia Carteret, who married William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. Granville's second marriage may have done something to increase his reputation for eccentricity. In February 1746 he allowed himself to be entrapped by the intrigues of the Pelhams into accepting the secretaryship, but resigned within forty-eight hours. In June 1751 he became President of the Council, and was still liked and trusted by the King, but his share in government did not go beyond giving advice, and endeavouring to forward ministerial arrangements. In 1756 he was asked by Newcastle to become Prime Minister as the alternative to Pitt, but having perfectly understood why the offer was made, declined and supported Pitt. When in October 1761 Pitt, who had information of the signing of the \\"Family Compact\\" wished to declare war on Spain, and declared his intention to resign unless his advice was accepted, Granville replied that \\"the opinion of the majority (of the Cabinet) must decide\\". He spoke in complimentary terms of Pitt but resisted his claim to be considered as a \\"sole minister\\" or Prime Minister. Whether he used the words attributed to him in the Annual Register for 1761 is more than doubtful, but the minutes of Council show that they express his meaning. Marriages and progeny He married twice: *Firstly to Frances Worsley (died 1743), daughter of Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet, by whom he had at least 6 children; 2 sons and 4 daughters: **George Carteret, born 14 February 1716, baptised 11 March 1716 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster, eldest son who predeceased his father. **Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville (1721‚Äì1776), born 21 September 1721, baptised 17 October 1721 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster, eldest surviving son and heir. **Louisa Carteret (c. 1712‚Äì1736) who married Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth of Longleat in Wiltshire, and was the ancestress of the Marquesses of Bath (created 1789) and Barons Carteret (of the second creation 1784). **Grace Carteret (born 8 July 1713, baptised 22 July 1713 at St James, Westminster), who married Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart, and had issue. **Georgiana Caroline Carteret (born 12 March 1715, baptised 5 April 1715 at St Martin-in- the-Fields, Westminster; died 1780), who married firstly John Spencer MP, and was the mother of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer; she married secondly William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper **Frances Carteret (born 6 April 1718, baptised 1 May 1718 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster), who married (in 1748) John Hay, 4th Marquess of Tweeddale. *Secondly in 1744 he married Sophia Fermor (died 1745), daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret. She died the following year during the birth of their only daughter: **Sophia Carteret, who married William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, and had issue. Death and burial He remained in office as President of the Privy Council until his death on 2 January 1763. His last act was to listen while on his death bed to the reading of the preliminaries of the Treaty of Paris (1763) by the Under- Secretary to the Secretary of State, Robert Wood, author of an essay on The Original Genius and Writings of Homer, who would have postponed the business, but Granville said that it \\"could not prolong his life to neglect his duty\\", and quoted in ancient Greek the speech of Sarpedon from the Iliad xii. 322‚Äì328, repeating the last word ·º¥ŒøŒºŒµŒΩ (\\"iomen\\") (the first word of verse 328) meaning \\"let us go forward\\". Wood recalled the event as follows: > \\"However, in the course of that active period, the duties of my situation > engaged me in an occasional attendance upon a nobleman, who, while he > presided at his Majesty‚Äôs councils, reserved some moments for literary > amusement. His Lordship was very partial to this subject; and I seldom had > the honour of receiving his commands on business, that he did not lead the > conversation to Greece and Homer. Being directed to wait upon his Lordship, > a few days before he died, with the preliminary articles of the Treaty of > Paris, I found him so languid, that I proposed postponing my business for > another time: but he insisted that I should stay, saying, it could not > prolong his life, to neglect his duty; and repeating the following passage, > out of Sarpedon‚Äôs speech, he dwelled with particular emphasis on the third > line, which recalled to his mind the distinguishing part, he had taken in > public affairs. His Lordship repeated the last word several times with a > calm and determinate resignation: and after a serious pause of some minutes, > he desired to hear the Treaty read; to which he listened with great > attention: and recovered spirits enough to declare the approbation of a > dying Statesman (I use his own words) on the most glorious War, and most > honourable Peace, this nation ever saw.\\" He died in his house in Arlington Street, London, on 2 January 1763. His remains were interred at Westminster Abbey. Succession The title of Earl Granville descended to his son Robert, who died without issue in 1776, when the earldom of this creation became extinct.  Legacy  Two North Carolina counties were named for Lord Carteret, Carteret County (established 1722) and Granville County (1746). During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area which is now South Carolina used the names Carteret and Granville for a few of its counties. Namesake of Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia; Granville, Massachusetts; Granville Centre, Nova Scotia, and Granville Ferry. Translator George Sale dedicated his Alcoran of Mohammed to Granville. John Carteret is depicted in the 2011 film Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides by Anton Lesser.

Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes to the extent that the subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat, resulting in profuse coughing, nasal mucus discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.\\"CS, chemical compound\\". columbia.thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved on 23 September 2007. CS was developed and tested secretly at Porton Down in Wiltshire, UK, in the 1950s and 1960s. CS was used first on animals, then subsequently on British Army servicemen volunteers. CS has less effect on animals due to \\"under-developed tear-ducts and protection by fur\\".\\"Orthochlorobenzylidenemalononitrile ClC6H4CHCCN(CN)2 \\". Zarc International. Retrieved on 23 September 2007  Production  CS is synthesized by the reaction of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile via the Knoevenagel condensation: left ::ClC6H4CHO + H2C(CN)2 ‚Üí ClC6H4CHC(CN)2 \\\\+ H2O The reaction is catalysed with weak base like piperidine or pyridine. The production method has not changed since the substance was discovered by Corson and Stoughton. Other bases, solvent free methods and microwave promotion have been suggested to improve the production of the substance. The physiological properties had been discovered already by the chemists first synthesising the compound in 1928: \\"Physiological Properties. Certain of these dinitriles have the effect of sneeze and tear gases. They are harmless when wet but to handle the dry powder is disastrous.\\" = Use as an aerosol = As 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile is a solid at room temperature, not a gas, a variety of techniques have been used to make this solid usable as an aerosol: * Melted and sprayed in the molten form. * Dissolved in organic solvent. * CS2 dry powder (CS2 is a siliconized, micro-pulverized form of CS). * CS from thermal grenades by generation of hot gases. In the Waco Siege in the United States, CS was dissolved in the organic solvent dichloromethane (also known as methylene chloride). The solution was dispersed as an aerosol via explosive force and when the highly volatile dichloromethane evaporated, CS crystals precipitated and formed a fine dispersion in the air.  Effects  CS Gas used on 1 May 2013 in Istanbul Tear gas shells used in Istanbul in 2013 CS gas shells used in Taksim Gezi Park, Istanbul, May 2013 Many types of tear gas and other riot control agents have been produced with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are the most widely used and known, but around 15 different types of tear gas have been developed worldwide, e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets and the size of the CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.\\"Safer Restraint: A report of the conference held in April 2002 at Church House, Westminster.\\" Police Complaints Authority. Retrieved on 23 September 2007 The chemical reacts with moisture on the skin and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses, it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Most of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although respiratory and oral symptoms may persist for months. Excessive exposure can cause chemical burns resulting in permanent scarring.\\"CS spray man 'scarred for life'\\". BBC News. 2 February 2006. Retrieved on 23 September 2007 Clothing affected by CS gas will need to be washed several times. = Secondary effects = People or objects contaminated with CS gas can cause secondary exposure to others, including healthcare professionals and police. In addition, repeated exposure may cause sensitisation.  Toxicity  TRPA1 (Transient Receptor Potential-Ankyrin 1) ion channel expressed on nociceptors (especially trigeminal) has been implicated as the site of action for CS gas in rodent models. Although described as a non-lethal weapon for crowd control, studies have raised doubts about this classification. CS can cause severe pulmonary damage and can also significantly damage the heart and liver. On 28 September 2000, Prof. Dr. Uwe Heinrich released a study commissioned by John C. Danforth, of the United States Office of Special Counsel, to investigate the use of CS by the FBI at the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel compound. He said no human deaths had been reported, but concluded that the lethality of CS used would have been determined mainly by two factors: whether gas masks were used and whether the occupants were trapped in a room. He suggests that if no gas masks were used and the occupants were trapped, then, \\"there is a distinct possibility that this kind of CS exposure can significantly contribute to or even cause lethal effects\\". CS gas can have a clastogenic effect (abnormal chromosome change) on mammalian cells, but no studies have linked it to miscarriages or stillbirths. In Egypt, CS gas was reported to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests. The solvent in which CS is dissolved, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), is classified as harmful by inhalation; irritating to the eyes and respiratory system; and repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.  Use  RWG≈Å-3 Polish tear gas grenade launcher. CS was used during attempts to flush the Viet Cong from their tunnels in the Vietnam War. CS is used in spray form by many police forces as a temporary incapacitant and to subdue attackers, persons, or civil protestors. Officers who are trained in the use and application of CS spray are routinely exposed to it as part of their training. Blank pistol cartridges carrying CS in powder form have been released to the public. These, when fired at relatively close ranges, fully expose the target to the effects of CS, and are employed as a potent defensive weapon in regions where blank firing pistols are legally permitted for such use. Although predominantly used by police it has also been used in criminal attacks in various countries.Kelso, Paul. \\"CS gas attack by former pupil injures 68 children.\\" The Guardian. 1 October 1999.

The reasoning behind the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one combatant could easily trigger retaliation with much more toxic chemical weapons such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, North Korea and Somalia.Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. \\"States that nave neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention\\".

The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry concluded that Bahrain's police used a disproportionate amount of CS gas when dispersing protests, and that in some situations, police fired CS gas into private homes in an \\"unnecessary and indiscriminate\\" manner. In one particular incident witnessed by Commission investigators, police fired \\"at least four tear gas canisters (each containing six projectiles) ... from a short range into the kitchen and living room of a home.\\" According to opposition activists and families of the dead, ten individuals died as a result of CS gas between 25 March 2011 and 17 December 2011. One allegedly died from the impact of the CS gas canister, and the remainder are said to have died from the effects of inhaling the gas. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry received information that a further three deaths may have been attributable to the use of CS gas. Of these three, one allegedly died from the impact of the canister, and two from the effects of inhaling the gas. = Canada = The Canadian Forces exposes basic training candidates to CS gas as part of gas mask training and drills. This training continues in subsequent career stages. Many law enforcement agencies also use CS gas as a riot control device. Since 2008, the SPVM police force in Montreal has increased its use of CS Gas for crowd control, although Police policy is to only use it as a last resort. Several incidents where protesters have been seriously injured by having CS gas fired at them from point-blank range have raised concerns about the methodology and training of Officers in the Montreal Riot Squad, particularly in relation to \\"Use of Force\\". = Chile = Tear gas is routinely used in Chile by Carabineros, to disrupt civilian protests. During the 2019 uprising the use of expired gas has been reported, prompting Carabineros to say that \\"they are like yogurt expired 5 days ago, it doesn‚Äôt damage people\\". = Peru = Peru Police forces spray CS gas in riot control situations. = Cyprus = CS was first tested in the field by the British army in Cyprus in 1958.

The CS gas canisters and content used were purchased by the Hong Kong SAR Government from CHEMRING, a British weapons manufacturer. The crowd used umbrellas to fend off the gas, which was often ineffective. Apart from the HK police, CS gas spray is also used by Witness Protection and Firearms Section of Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong). From 12 June to 4 August 2019, police used 1000 tear gas canisters. Then, on the single day of 5 August, police fired more than 800 tear gas canisters in their operations throughout almost every district of the city. In one instance, a tear gas canister was deployed indoors, in Kwai Fong Station during a march, on 11 August 2019. The police initially denied the incident. In defense, protestors are seen picking up tear gas cans with thick gloves to throw them back or to extinguish them in sealed water containers. Up to 22 October 2019, over 5000 made-in-China tear gas canisters have been deployed by the Hong Kong Police Force. Canisters marked with dates overdue have been collected in many occasions. It is unpredictable for the potential hazards to the Hong Kong environment and living conditions. Recent massive deaths of fish around Hong Kong seas was also suspected to be one of the consequences. Many birds were found dead in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, after 12 November that the riot police fired over 2000 tear gases towards the campus. A Hong Kong journalist, Chan Yu-hong from the Stand News declared he was diagnosed with chloracne (by Traditional Chinese physician instead of physician) after exposure to made-in-China tear gas while covering the 2019 Hong Kong Protests. The overuse of tear gas has been one of the concerns in the anti-extradition bill protests. = Iraq = Iraq successfully developed CS during the 1970s and during the 1980s produced tons of the substance firstly at Salman Pak and later at al-Muthanna.\\"WMD Profiles: Chemical .\\" Iraq Watch.

The tear gas was fired in the building and all the people in the building including reporters were affected. = Romania = The Gendarmerie of Bucharest used large quantities of CS gas against civilians during the protests of 10 August 2018 in Bucharest. = Spain = Tear gas is not commonly used in Spain but it has been used some times to disrupt civilian protests by the Policia Nacional and Mossos d'Esquadra in Catalonia. = Sri Lanka = The LTTE, also known as Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, an insurgent group in Sri Lanka used CS gas against government forces in September 2008. Its use hindered the army's progress but ultimately proved ineffective in preventing the army from overrunning LTTE positions. This is one of the few cases of insurgents using CS gas. = Sudan = The Sudanese forces extensively used CS gas during the latest wave of demonstrations began in 2018. The use of the CS gas of gunshots type or hand grenade is not exclusive for police forces. It is widely used by non-trained militia to suppress protesters movement. CS gas shots is generally used as a shooting weapon aimed of the faces of protesters and cause serious injury and probably permanent eyes damage. Some cases were recorded of death of chocking on tear gas bombed in closed or semi-closed areas. = United Kingdom =  Northern Ireland  CS gas was used extensively in the Bogside area of Derry, Northern Ireland during the \\"Battle of the Bogside\\", a two-day riot in August 1969. A total of 1,091 canisters containing 12.5g of CS each, and 14 canisters containing 50 g of CS each, were released in the densely populated residential area. On 30 August the Himsworth Inquiry was set up to investigate the medical effects of its use in Derry. Its conclusions, viewed in the political context of the time, still pointed towards the necessity of further testing of CS gas before being used as a riot control agent. During the rioting in Belfast, the following year, known as the Falls Curfew, the Army fired up to 1,600 canisters into the densely populated Falls Road area. It was also used in Lenadoon on 9 July 1972 on the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire. Not long after, the British Army and RUC ceased using CS in Northern Ireland.  Great Britain  =CS gas= CS gas has not been routinely deployed on the British mainland. It has seen use in rare cases. The first use of CS gas on the UK mainland that was not part of military training was carried out in 1944 during a hostage siege at a north London address. Soldiers were asked to throw CS grenades through the skylight in hope of bringing the incident to a speedy conclusion, but the hostage-taker had brought his civilian-issue gas mask with him, negating the effect. The siege of Trough Gate 1973 in Oldham was the second non-military use of CS gas on the UK mainland. During a four-hour standoff, Frank Alan Stockton shot at police but was flushed from his home with CS gas and police dogs. During the 1980 assault on the Iranian Embassy, SAS soldiers used CS gas contained within stun grenades to incapacitate the militants who had kept the building under siege for six days. All but one of the remaining hostages were saved and all but one of the hostage-takers were killed, with the other being taken into custody. In 1981, CS gas was used to quell rioting in the Toxteth area of Liverpool.\\"On This Day: 20 May 1965: British police to be issued with tear gas.\\" BBC News. Retrieved on 23 September 2007 Following the 2011 England riots, there was consideration given to making CS gas, water cannon and other riot control measures available to police for use in the event of serious disorder. The British Armed Forces use CS gas annually to test their chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense (CBRN) equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by placing them in a small enclosed space known as a Confidence Test Facility (CTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators so that they are exposed to the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work. =CS spray= CS incapacitant spray has been used routinely by the British police since its introduction in 1996. It is issued as an item of equipment to police officers for protection and to assist in dealing with violent incidents. A six-month trial by sixteen police forces in England began on 1 March 1996. CS spray was used in the UK more than 10,000 times in the period between its introduction in 1996 and September 1998. Some forces have opted to replace CS spray with Captor or PAVA spray, with 60% of forces now estimated to be using PAVA. The CS spray used by police forces is in the form of a hand-held aerosol canister containing a 5% solution of CS dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone and propelled by pressurized nitrogen. The CS spray used by UK police is generally more concentrated than that used by American police forces (5% vs 1%). The liquid stream is directed where the user points the canister, being accurate up to 4 metres. Police are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained. Under UK firearm law, CS and other incapacitant sprays are classed as prohibited weapons, making it unlawful for a member of the public to possess them. On 16 March 1996, a Gambian asylum seeker, Ibrahima Sey, was taken to Ilford Police Station in east London. Whilst incapacitating Sey, who was suffering from excited delirium, police sprayed him with CS spray and held him on the ground for approximately 15 minutes, and he subsequently died.\\"Report on the death of Ibrahima Sey.\\" Inquest. 1997 In 1999, the mental health charity MIND called for a suspension of the use of CS spray on mentally ill people until it was proved to be safe.\\"Experts fear unknown CS spray risks.\\" BBC News. 24 September 1999.

In his honor, several thousand people peacefully assembled to listen to speakers remembering his life. National Guard troops surrounded Sproul Plaza, donned their gas masks, and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicopters dropped CS gas directly on the trapped crowd. No escape was possible, and the gas caused acute respiratory distress, disorientation, temporary blindness and vomiting. Many people, including children and the elderly, were injured during the ensuing panic. The gas was so intense that breezes carried it into Cowell Memorial Hospital, endangering patients, interrupting operations and incapacitating nurses.

Members of the United States armed forces are exposed to CS during initial training, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a military gas mask or protective mask, as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence in the ability of the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training.TRADOC Regulation 350-6 TRADOC 2007. Retrieved on 13 October 2008 CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the escape-and-evasion exercise (\\"Trail of Tears\\"), the last event before graduation from the course. Navy Corpsmen participating in Field Medic training in order to serve with the Marines must go through their second CS gas exercise before finally arriving at their unit. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed until the end of the exercise. This could last anywhere from 3‚Äì12 hours and would make running 25 km while wearing of gear virtually impossible. = Vietnam = It has been reported that thousands of tons of CS gas were used by the U.S. forces in Vietnam to bring Viet Cong into the open. It was also used by the North Vietnamese forces in some battles like Hue in 1968 or during the Easter Offensive in 1972. = Elsewhere = CS gas has been and is still routinely used by Greek riot police (MAT) in order to quell student and labour protests, as well as riots. CS was used to quell a protest in Lusaka, Zambia in July 1997 and the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle. Amnesty International reported that it had been manufactured by the UK company Pains-Wessex. Subsequently, Amnesty called for an export ban when the receiving regime is either not fully trained in the use of CS, or had shown usage \\"contrary to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions\\". In September 2000, the Guardian newspaper revealed how a UK company, HPP, used legal loopholes to export CS to a private security company in Rwanda, in breach of United Nations sanctions. The Guardian also reported that CS was used by the Hutu militia in Rwanda to flush Tutsis out of buildings before hacking them to death. CS has been used by the government in South Africa; by Israel against Palestinians and Israelis; by the South Korean government in Seoul, and during the Balkan conflicts by Serbia. In Malta it was used by police between 1981 and 1987 to the detriment of Nationalist Party Supporters. CS tear gas was used at the G8 protests in Genoa, Italy and Quebec City, Canada during the FTAA anti- globalization demonstrations during the Quebec City Summit of the Americas. The Malaysia Federal Reserve Unit has also been known to use CS tear gas against its citizens who rallied for clean and fair elections under what were called Bersih rallies in 2011 and 2012. The Canadian, Norwegian and Australian Defence Forces train their personnel with CS gas in a manner similar to that of the US, as it is a basic part of CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) training. Gas is released by burning tablets, usually in a building reserved for this purpose (a \\"gas hut\\"). In the training, the person enters the building unprotected, and must fit and clear the gas mask before leaving. Other drills such as drinking and under-mask decontamination are also practised. Some Norwegian units are exposed to CS gas while engaged in mental and physical activity such as addressing the officer in command by stating name, rank and troop before doing 30 push-ups. In Australia, prison officers used CS gas against five teenage boys in Darwin's Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre in August 2014.

They probably originated in the Kalmarsund Sandstone of Southern Sweden (Jaeger and Martinsson 1966), which was deposited in the Lower Cambrian (Upper Tommotian‚ÄìLower Atdabanian; Stages 2‚Üí3). The specimens are not especially well preserved. The older specimen is 10 cm or so in length with a narrow, weakly segmented body. A depression runs up the bottom on all but the rearmost segments. There is a slightly bulbous tail, and each segment beyond that seems to have a single pair of tapering annulated legs similar to the modern onychophore, but without claws. Nine segments are present. There is a spine on each body bump and faint transverse parallel striations on the annulations on the legs. The legs of what is possibly the foremost segments are either missing or not preserved. The head is believed to be missing or is poorly preserved. If Xenusion is an arthropod/onychophore, it is one of the oldest currently known fossils of a mobile, modern animal. It's been said to have a long narrow proboscis, but this is probably a preservational artefact.RAMSK√ñLD, L. and CHEN, J.-Y. 1998. Cambrian lobopodians: morphology and phylogeny. In EDGECOMBE, G. D.

It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia, where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically. It is winter hardy, but cold weather at flowering time during the spring reduces the size of the crop. Bunches of small, glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine. Breeding is common in Scotland, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and New Zealand to produce fruit with better eating qualities and bushes with greater hardiness and disease resistance. The raw fruit is particularly rich in vitamin C and polyphenols. Blackcurrants can be eaten raw, but are usually cooked in sweet or savoury dishes. They are used to make jams, preserves, and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market. The fruit is also used to make alcoholic beverages and dyes. Description Blackcurrant shrub Ribes nigrum, the blackcurrant, is a medium-sized shrub, growing to . The leaves are alternate, simple, broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin. All parts of the plant are strongly aromatic. The flowers are produced in racemes known as \\"strigs\\" up to long containing ten to twenty flowers, each about in diameter. Each flower has a hairy calyx with yellow glands, the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals. There are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels. The flowers open in succession from the base of the strig and are mostly insect pollinated, but some pollen is distributed by the wind. A pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule. In warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week, and by that time, the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive. If fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised, the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely. Frost can damage both unopened and open flowers when the temperature falls below . The flowers at the base of the strig are more protected by the foliage and are less likely to be damaged. In midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year. Plants from Northern Asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety, Ribes nigrum var. sibiricum, of which Ribes cyathiforme is considered a synonym. Cultivation =Site selection and planting= Blackcurrant in the mountains of Zakamensky district of Buryatia, Russia Blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, as long as their nutrient requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year. Two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used. Planting certified stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more. In the UK, young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base. =Manures and fertilizers= The blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs; phosphorus aids growth, the setting of fruit and crop yield; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds. An annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material. Spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils. The blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen, and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually. A balanced artificial fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant. Weed growth can be suppressed with an organic mulch such as sawdust, bark, mushroom compost or straw, heavy plastic topped with an organic mulch cover or landscape fabric. =Pruning= Blackcurrant flowers Fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned to remove old unproductive wood and to encourage new shoots. An established bush should not be allowed to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged. =Harvesting= On a garden scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling a row of bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market. =Diseases and pests= Blackcurrant Ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests. However, new varieties have been developed, or are being developed, to overcome some of these problems. Reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds (\\"big bud\\") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free. White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two alternate hosts to complete its life cycle. One host is plants in the genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust. As a result, the blackcurrant was banned in the United States as a disease vector for much of the 20th century, and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966, several U.S. states continued their own bans, some of which remain in force today. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease, some are native to North America, and others such as red currants and Ribes uva-crispa were never banned. American gooseberry mildew and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance. The blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs. =Research and breeding= There are many cultivars of blackcurrant. 'Baldwin' was the mainstay of the industry for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease- resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centered mainly in Scotland, Poland, and New Zealand. In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' was the first of the 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour. Varieties producing green fruit, less strongly-flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants, are cultivated in Finland, where they are called \\"greencurrants\\" (viherherukka). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (Ribes grossularia), the red currant (Ribes rubrum) and the flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to R. nigrum. Cultivars produced include 'Tisel' and 'Tiben' in 2000 and 'Ores', 'Ruben' and 'Tines' in 2005. Further cultivars 'Polares' and 'Tihope' are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit. In North America, there is a need for this fruit to have resistance to white pine blister rust. New cultivars such as 'Crusader', 'Coronet' and 'Consort' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile. Back- crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'Titania' that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting. Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia, Canada, 'Blackcomb' and 'Tahsis', were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance. History Willem Claesz. Heda: The Blackcurrant Pie (1641), Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg The blackcurrant is native to northern Europe and Asia. It was cultivated in Russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements. Cultivation in Europe is thought to have started around the last decades of the 17th century. Decoction of the leaves, bark or roots was also used as a traditional remedy. During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin, and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under the age of two. This may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market. As of 2017, major cultivation efforts to improve fruit characteristics occurred in Scotland, New Zealand, and Poland. Blackcurrants were once popular in the United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were considered a threat to the U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to the jurisdictions of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market. In Lithuanian cuisine, Juod≈≥j≈≥ serbent≈≥ pyragas, or blackcurrant pie, is a popular dessert. Uses =Culinary uses= The fruit of blackcurrants when eaten raw has a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a pur√©e, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The pur√©e can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets, and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of r√∏dgr√∏d, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines. Blackcurrants are also used in savoury cooking. Their astringency creates added flavour in sauces, meats and other dishes. Blackcurrants are included in some unusual combinations of foods. They can be added to tomato and mint to make a salad. Blackcurrants may accompany roast beef, grilled lamb, seafood and shellfish. They can provide a dipping sauce at barbecues. They can be blended with mayonnaise, and used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits. Blackcurrants can be combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas. Japan imports US$3.6 million of New Zealand blackcurrants for uses as dietary supplements, snacks, functional food products and as quick-frozen (IQF) produce for culinary production as jams, jellies or preserves. =Beverages= The juice forms the basis for various cordials, juice drinks, and smoothies. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the ap√©ritif, cr√®me de cassis, which in turn is added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royal. In the United Kingdom, a blackcurrant cordial may be mixed with cider (hard cider) to make a drink called \\"cider and black\\". If made with any common British lager beer, it is known as a \\"lager and black\\". The addition of blackcurrant to a mix of cider and lager results in \\"diesel\\" or \\"snakebite and black\\" available at pubs. A \\"black 'n' black\\" can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout. The head is purple if the shot of juice is placed in the glass first. Blackcurrant juice may be combined with whey in an energy drink. In Russia, blackcurrant leaves may be used for flavoring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavor and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices. Blackcurrant seed oil is an ingredient in cosmetics preparations, often in combination with vitamin E. The leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye, and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye resulting from its rich content of anthocyanins. Nutrients Raw blackcurrants are 82% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein and 0.4% fat (table). Per 100 g serving providing 63 kilocalories, the raw fruit has high vitamin C content (218% of the Daily Value, DV) and moderate levels of iron and manganese (12% DV each). Other nutrients are present in negligible amounts (less than 10% DV, table). Phytochemicals Polyphenol phytochemicals present in the fruit, seeds and leaves, are being investigated for their potential biological activities. Major anthocyanins in blackcurrant pomace are delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, which are retained in the juice concentrate among other yet unidentified polyphenols. Blackcurrant seed oil is rich in vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid and gamma- linolenic acid.

He is inspired by his predecessor, the Green Goblin, and utilizes similar equipment. The Hobgoblin was created by Roger Stern and John Romita Jr.Marvel Age #111, April 1992, Marvel Comics and the first use of the Hobgoblin identity by Roderick Kingsley happened in The Amazing Spider-Man #238 (March 1983) where only his secret hideout was revealed, and not his secret identity. The Hobgoblin mantle was then carried on exclusively by Jason Macendale during the late 1980s and most of the 1990s. Another character to assume the Hobgoblin alias was Phil Urich. The character has made been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including animated series and video games. Publication history The Amazing Spider- Man #238 (March 1983), the Hobgoblin's first appearance. Cover art by John Romita Sr. The Hobgoblin was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr. for The Amazing Spider-Man #238 (March 1983). Like other writers, Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the Green Goblin again, but did not wish to bring Norman Osborn or Bart Hamilton back from the dead, have Harry Osborn be the Green Goblin again, or create yet another Green Goblin. Stern instead created a new concept as heir to the Goblin legacy and developed the Hobgoblin. Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base the costume on the Green Goblin's but to make it \\"a little more medieval-looking\\", while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis. Both agree, however, that the costume was chiefly Romita's design. The Hobgoblin's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the Spider-Man comics. According to Stern, \\"I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita, Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin‚Äôs speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of [The] Spectacular [Spider-Man].\\" A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive explanation for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Kingsley in Amazing Spider-Man #249. Stern's original plan was to have the Hobgoblin's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in The Amazing Spider-Man #264. However, Stern left after The Amazing Spider-Man #251, and editor Tom DeFalco took his place. Wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to Stern's stories, DeFalco asked Stern who the Hobgoblin was, but objected when Stern said it was Kingsley. DeFalco argued that the \\"twin brother\\" scheme was cheating the readers since there had been no hint that Roderick even had a brother (aside from a single thought bubble), much less one who could serve as a body double. Stern disagreed but said that DeFalco should feel free to choose whoever DeFalco wanted for the Hobgoblin's secret identity, reasoning that \\"I knew that whomever Tom chose, he would make it work.\\" Upon reviewing the clues, DeFalco decided that the Hobgoblin was Richard Fisk. Moreover, he decided that the Hobgoblin's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible, since it was the chief element that made the Hobgoblin interesting. Through both Stern and DeFalco's runs, mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art, with the covers of Amazing Spider- Man #245, 251, and 276 all showing Spider-Man unmasking the Hobgoblin. Artist John Romita Jr. signing a copy of The Amazing Spider-Man #238, in which the Hobgoblin first appeared, at Midtown Comics in Manhattan The mystery was further complicated after James Owsley came on as editor of the Spider-Man titles. Owsley's relationship with DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz was strained from the beginning. When Owsley asked who the Hobgoblin was at a creators conference, DeFalco lied and said the man in question was Ned Leeds. Owsley then wrote the one-shot Spider-Man vs Wolverine in which Leeds is killed off (though the actual death is not shown), and instructed The Spectacular Spider- Man writer Peter David to reveal the Hobgoblin's identity as the Foreigner. David objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was Leeds; having been present at the Spider-Man creator's conference, David also thought that Leeds was who DeFalco intended it to be. Because Spider-Man vs. Wolverine had already been drawn, however, it was too late to undo Leeds's death. Thus, the Hobgoblin's identity was revealed posthumously in The Amazing Spider-Man #289 (a double-sized issue). With Spider-Man's archenemy now dead, a new storyline was created from Jason Macendale's hatred of the Hobgoblin. Though the Hobgoblin's posthumous unmasking as Leeds was unpopular with fans, David said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story, arguing that the Hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with Spider-Man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before, whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking. From 1987 to 1997, Macendale initially wielded only the Hobgoblin's weaponry but the 1988-1989 Inferno crossover writer Gerry Conway had Macendale imbued with demonic powers by N'astirh. In addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than that of the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigure Macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Several years later, Macendale succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and was later revamped again with cybernetic implants. Stern was unhappy with the Hobgoblin's civilian identity revelation was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives in 1997, with the retcon that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin while Leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy, Macendale is killed off, and Kingsley returned. According to Stern, initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two Hobgoblins, and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that Kingsley kill Macendale and return to operating as the Hobgoblin. Fictional character biography =Roderick Kingsley= Roderick Kingsley is an amoral billionaire fashion designer. He decided to create a name criminal for himself by altering Norman Osborn's Goblin formula and improve the Goblin costume/equipment in order to be the original Hobgoblin. Kingsley then frames Ned Leeds as a decoy for his crimes, and later murders his successor Jason Macendale.Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1 (January 1997) When his villainous identity is finally exposed by Spider-Man and Betty Brant, he flees to the Caribbean to hide from both the law and his enemies.Amazing Spider-Man #259-261 After his twin brotherAmazing Spider-Man #691 is murdered by Phil Urich,The Amazing Spider-Man #649 Roderick returns to New York and dons his old Hobgoblin costume.The Amazing Spider-Man #697 (November 2012) =Lefty Donovan= Arnold Samuel \\"Lefty\\" Donovan was a petty thug. Similar to Osborn, Donovan was a test subject mix the two vital chemicals that were mixed into the Goblin formula, disfiguring Donovan's face and granting superhuman abilities. Donovan is taken to a hospital. Brainwashed by Gerhard Winkler's device, Donovan eventually escapes the hospital and follows preprogrammed instructions to go to a hidden cache of Goblin weapons and dress up as the Hobgoblin. Donovan (impersonating the Hobgoblin) attacks New York City but Spider-Man eventually confronts and unmasks him. Spider-Man sees his (scarred) face and recognizes Lefty. As Donovan is able to shake off some of his programing and starts talking, his \\"boss\\" programmed the Goblin glider to crash into the side of a building, killing Lefty with the falling rubble. =Ned Leeds= Edward \\"Ned\\" Leeds was a reporter working for the Daily Bugle. He was brainwashed to act as a stand-in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that he was the Hobgoblin, and was later murdered by the Foreigner after the actual supervillain was decided that he was no longer needed.Spider-Man versus Wolverine (February 1987) =Jason Macendale= Jason Philip Macendale Jr. was a mercenary who had been trained by the CIA (and various para-military organizations). He first appeared as the supervillain Jack O'Lantern before eventually adopting the Hobgoblin identity.The Amazing Spider-Man #289 =Daniel Kingsley= Daniel Kingsley is Roderick Kingsley's twin brother. He would act as a body double until being exposed by Betty Brant while the true Hobgoblin gets unmasked by Spider-Man. Now in protective custody, Daniel was unknowingly used by Roderick to blackmail Norman Osborn, resulting in the Hobgoblin to swoop in to collect Daniel. Spider-Man defends Daniel but is drugged while Daniel passes out and both are taken to Osborn.Spectacular Spider-Man #260 (August 1998) As Kingsley and Osborn furiously fight each other, Daniel gets rescued by Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man #261 (September 1998) Kingsley later returned to New York, posing as his twin brother as the Hobgoblin. Kingsley investigated an old lair at OsCorp which had a flaming energy sword, but discovers Phil Urich trying to retrieve the same gear. Kingsley gets stunned by Urich's \\"Lunatic Laugh\\" long enough for Urich to kill him using his own sword, allowing his killer to claim the Hobgoblin mantle. =Phil Urich= Phillip Benjamin \\"Phil\\" Urich (who once used the Green Goblin identity to operate as a superhero) took on the Hobgoblin identity himself as a supervillain with some new gear (new body armor, a winged jetpack, and a flaming energy sword). =Norman Osborn= Norman Osborn briefly impersonated the original Hobgoblin.Superior Spider-Man #18 =Claude= Claude was Roderick's butler who was sent in place and to talk like his master to distract the Goblin Nation. He fought against the Goblin King and was killed in battle. The Goblin Knight discovered who the Hobgoblin that killed was and destroyed Claude's body to keep the Goblin King from finding out who was impersonating Hobgoblin.The Superior Spider-Man #26 Powers, abilities, and equipment As the Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley wears bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a Goblin glider, a one- man miniature turbo-fan-powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas- emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry. While brainwashed, Ned Leeds wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used the glider and equipment which included Jack O'Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength. As the Hobgoblin, Phil Urich wears an orange Hobgoblin costume with wings on the back that allow him to fly without the use of a Goblin Glider and he took Roderick Kingsley's mask as his own. He uses the traditional Pumpkin Bombs all Green Goblins and Hobgoblins before him have used, but he also has a new flaming sword. He still retains his \\"Lunatic Laugh\\" from when he was the Goblin and he also has superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, reflexes and senses, and enhanced intellect. For unknown reasons, he no longer needs his mask to activate this power. With the help of Reverbium, his \\"Lunatic Laugh\\" was able to cause a building to collapse.The Amazing Spider-Man #651 (January 2011). Marvel Comics. Reception In 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by IGN's as the 57th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. Other versions =Hobgoblin 2211= Hobgoblin 2211 first appears in Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man. While her costume sports the twentieth-century Green Goblins' green-and-purple color scheme, she boasted that she was the Hobgoblin of 2211. Her identity was not revealed to readers (or to the visiting Spider-Men of previous eras) at the time, but her later reappearance in Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (also written by David) revealed her true identity and origin. Hobgoblin 2211 is Robin \\"Hobby\\"/\\"Hob\\" Bourne, Spider-Man's daughter. Her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter. She wanted to save the universes from 'intersecting'; in other words, having other parallel universes merge with the existing one, causing it to override. She was later arrested by her father for something that she would have done in future: unauthorized time travel, chronal displacement, jumping the tracks to other realities. She was held in a virtual reality prison where she lives a benign and trouble-free existence in what appears to be Kansas. Her boyfriend attempts to free her by uploading a virus into the prison, but inadvertently causes her to be driven insane. She attacked her father with a 'retcon bomb' (a variation on the original Goblins' pumpkin bombs) but it hit her boyfriend instead, erasing (or 'retconning') him from existence. Now suited up as the Hobgoblin, Robin managed to time-travel to the current year, attacking the current Spider-Man in his reality and derailing an Uncle Ben from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox. Later, in a confrontation with her father, she threw a 'retcon bomb' at him. Spider-Man, believing it to be no more harmful than a regular pumpkin bomb, caught it with his web and threw it back to Robin, unwittingly erasing her from existence. =JLA/Avengers= In the last issue of JLA/Avengers, the Hobgoblin is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold, and is defeated by Hawkgirl.Avengers/JLA #4 (May 2004) =Marvel Adventures= In this continuity, Hobgoblin is an unidentified criminal who found a stash of Green Goblin's weaponry because he had forgotten to leave the entrance locked.

He tries to stop himself during a battle with Spider-Man but Shaw takes over and is wounded by S.H.I.E.L.D.,Ultimate Spider-Man #74 and later once again used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to attract his father but the two Osborns end up doing battle which leaves the younger Osborn dead.Ultimate Spider-Man #115-117 =Sword-and-sorcery= In the 2007 Spider-Man/Red Sonja mini-series, the Hobgoblin was one of several supervillains who was transformed into a sword-and-sorcery version of themselves due to the spell cast by Kulan Gath. It was never specified which Hobgoblin it was. =Spider-Verse= The Earth-21205 version of Hobgoblin is Peter Parker. Overwhelmed with rage over the death of Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man murdered the Green Goblin and later retired his Spider-Man identity. He soon after became the Hobgoblin and was later targeted by Verna of the Inheritors (alongside the Hounds Scorpion and Rhino) as a Spider-Totem. The Spider-Woman of Earth-65 attempted to recruit him into a growing army of Spiders to protect him from the Inheritors, but he initially turned the offer down. When Spider-Woman revealed herself to be an alternate version of Gwen, he sacrificed himself to save her as atonement for failing to do so in his own dimension.Spider-Verse Team-Up #2 The Earth-001 version of Hobgoblin appeared as a member of Verna's Hounds alongside the multiple Green Goblins.

Marvel Comics. =Newspaper strip= In \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" newspaper strip by Stan Lee and Larry Leiber, Harry Osborn as the Hobgoblin has repeatedly attacked Spider-Man, seeking vengeance for his father's death. After trying to kill both Spider-Man and Black Widow after, under hypnotic influence of psychiatrist \\"Dr. Stone\\" (actually spy-assassin Dimitri Gregorin who has killed friends of the Black Widow in the past), Harry, seeing Spider-Man's heroism, realizes that Spider-Man is a hero, his father was a murderer, and vows to never assume the Hobgoblin identity again. In other media =Television= * An amalgamated incarnation of Hobgoblin appeared in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, voiced by Mark Hamill. This depiction (under the alias of \\"Jason Philips\\") is a composite character of Roderick Kingsley's criminal ambitions and likeness, Jason Macendale's mercenary status, Lefty Donovan's criminal background as a former petty crook. Additionally, his identity and weapons were developed by Norman Osborn. In his two-part, self- titled episode, the Hobgoblin tries to kill the Kingpin. After the assassination is foiled by \\"both\\" Peter Parker and Spider-Man, the Hobgoblin demands Osborn pay for another chance, but the latter fires him. In response, the Hobgoblin seeks out a partnership with the Kingpin and kidnaps Harry Osborn. However, the Kingpin refuses to pay immediately, so the mercenary returns to Osborn. Receiving an improved glider and weapons, the Hobgoblin battles Spider-Man across New York before the web-slinger is forced to work with Osborn and the Kingpin to stop the mercenary from taking over Kingpin's criminal empire. In the end, Hobgoblin crashes into a nearby river while trying to kill the Osborns. In \\"The Mutant Agenda\\" and \\"Mutant's Revenge\\", the Hobgoblin resurfaced after learning Dr. Herbert Landon was planning to exterminate mutants and blackmailed the scientist. The mercenary comes into conflict with Spider-Man and the X-Men, but he escapes with discs outlining Landon's master plan and mutates the scientist into a monster to keep the heroes busy. In the episodes \\"Rocket Racer\\" and \\"The Spot\\", his identity is revealed to be Jason Philips, Felicia Hardy's fianc√©. In the episode \\"Goblin War\\", the Hobgoblin obtains the portal-creating Time Dilation Accelerator, confronting Spider-Man and clashing with the Green Goblin as well. Once his identity is revealed, he and Felicia were kidnapped by the Goblin who stole the machine and arranged for the engaged couple to be killed in an acid pool. While Spider-Man saves the Hobgoblin and Felicia, they ended their relationship and he was taken into custody afterward. In the series finale \\"Spider-Wars\\", an alternate-reality Hobgoblin was seen as an enemy of the Scarlet Spider. * The Hobgoblin was set to appear in The Spectacular Spider- Man animated series before the show was cancelled. * The Roderick Kingsley incarnation of Hobgoblin appears in Marvel Super Hero Adventures, voiced by Andrew Francis. * The Hobgoblin alias and equipment appear in the 2010s Spider-Man animated series.

Implied to be a hybrid clone of previous Goblin villains created by his time's Doctor Octopus, this version is a mercenary hired by Alchemax with hybrid nanofiber bio-organic circuitry wings bonded to his back and \\"psy-powers\\". After obtaining a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos, the Hobgoblin ambushes Spider-Man 2099 and has the web-slinger pursue him as he wreaks havoc. After Spider-Man corners him, he uses the fragment to increase his psy-powers and torment the web-slinger with a hellish hallucination of gargoyle-like monsters. Ultimately, Spider-Man defeats the Hobgoblin and retrieves his tablet fragment before examining his wings and deducing Alchemax's involvement. * The Roderick Kingsley incarnation of Hobgoblin appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. =Merchandise= * The Hobgoblin first received a toy in the Secret Wars toy line produced by Mattel. * The Hobgoblin was prominently featured in the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series toyline.

The RER combines the operations and roles of a local city-centre underground rail system and suburbs-to-city-centre commuter rail. Inside the city centre, the RER functions much like the M√©tro, although it is faster, as it has fewer stops. This has made it a model for proposals to improve transit within other cities. The network consists of five lines: A, B, C, D and E. The network has 257 stations and has several connections with the Paris M√©tro within the City of Paris. The lines are identified by letters to avoid confusion with the M√©tro lines, which are identified by numbers. The network is still expanding: RER E, which opened in 1999, is planned for westward extension toward La D√©fense and Mantes-la-Jolie in two phases by 2020‚Äì2022. Characteristics The RER contains 257 stations, 33 of which are within the city of Paris, and runs over of track, including underground. Each line passes through the city almost exclusively underground and on dedicated tracks. The RER is operated partly by RATP, the transport authority that operates most public transportation in Paris, and partly by SNCF, the national rail operator. In spite of this, the system uses a single fare structure and no transfer is needed between sections run by the two operators. Total traffic on the central sections of lines A and B, operated by RATP, was 452 million people in 2006; in the same year, total traffic on all lines operated by SNCF (both RER and Transilien trains) was 657 million.Les transports en commun, edition 2005-2006, Mairie de Paris. RATP manages 65 RER stations, including all stations on Line A east of Nanterre-Pr√©fecture and those on the branch to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It also operates stations on Line B south of Gare du Nord. Other stations on the two lines and those on lines C, D and E are operated by SNCF. Of the RER stations operated by RATP, 9 have interchanges with M√©tro lines, and 9 allow transfer to SNCF's Transilien service.Statistiques Annuelles 2006, D√©partiment Commercial Tarification, Vente R√©sultats LAC A73 54,quai de la Rap√©e-75599 Paris History =Origins= The origins of the RER can be traced back to the 1936 Ruhlmann- Langewin plan of the Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris (Metropolitan Railway Company of Paris) for a \\"m√©tropolitain express\\" (express metro). The company's post-war successor, RATP, revived the scheme in the 1950s, and in 1960 an interministerial committee decided to go ahead with the construction of an east-west line. Subsequently, the central part of the RER was completed between 1962 and 1977 in a large-scale civil engineering project whose chief supervisor was Siavash Teimouri. As its instigator, RATP was granted authority to run the new link. The embryonic (and as yet unnamed) RER was not properly conceived until the 1965 Sch√©ma directeur d'am√©nagement et d'urbanisme (roughly: \\"master plan for urban development\\"), which envisioned an H-shaped network with two north-south routes. Between 1969 and 1970 RATP purchased the Vincennes and Saint-Germain lines from SNCF, as the basis for the east-west link. Only a single north-south route crossing the Left Bank has so far come to fruition, although the M√©tro's line 13 has been extended to perform a similar function. =First phase= In the first phase of construction, the Vincennes and Saint-Germain lines became the ends of the east-west Line A, the central section of which was opened station by station between 1969 and 1977. On its completion, Line A was joined by the initial southern section of the north-south Line B. During this first phase, six new stations were built, three of which are entirely underground. Construction was inaugurated by Robert Buron, then Minister for Public Works, at the Pont de Neuilly on 6 July 1961, four years before the publication of the official network blueprint. The rapid expansion of the La D√©fense business district in the west made the western section of the first line a priority. Nation, the first new station, was opened on 12 December 1969 and temporarily became the new western terminus of the Vincennes line.Deep-Level Underground for Paris The Railway Magazine issue 826 February 1970 pages 80-83 The section from √âtoile (not yet renamed after Charles de Gaulle) to La D√©fense was opened a few weeks later. It was subsequently extended eastward to the newly built Auber station on 23 November 1971, and westward to Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 1 October 1972. The latter extension was achieved by a connection to the existing Saint-Germain-en-Laye line, the oldest railway line into Paris, at Nanterre. The RER network came into being on 9 December 1977 with the joining of the eastern Nation-Boissy segment and the western Auber-Saint-Germain-en- Laye segment at Ch√¢telet - Les Halles. The southern Ligne de Sceaux was simultaneously extended from Luxembourg to meet Line A at Ch√¢telet - Les Halles, becoming the new Line B. The system of line letters was introduced to the public on this occasion, though it had been used internally by RATP and SNCF for some time. =Completion= A second phase, from the end of the 1970s, was carried out more slowly. SNCF gained the authorisation to operate its own routes, which became lines C, D and E. Extensive sections of suburban tracks were added to the network, but only four new stations were built. In this time period, the network was completed in the following stages: * Line C (along the Left Bank of the Seine) was added in 1979, involving the construction of a link between Invalides and Mus√©e d'Orsay. * Line B was extended to Gare du Nord in 1981 with a new deep tunnel from Ch√¢telet - Les Halles. It was subsequently extended further northward. * Line D (north to south-east via Ch√¢telet - Les Halles) was completed in 1995 with the construction of a deep tunnel between Ch√¢telet - Les Halles and Gare de Lyon. No new building work was necessary at Ch√¢telet - Les Halles, as additional platforms for Line D had been built at the time of the station's construction 20 years earlier. * Line E was added in 1999, connecting the north-east with Gare Saint-Lazare by means of a new deep tunnel from Gare de l'Est. =Finance= The RER's first phase of construction during the 1960s and 1970s was marked by scale and expense. In 1973 alone, FRF 2 billion were committed to the project in the budget. This equates to roughly ‚Ç¨1.37 billion in 2005 terms, and closer to double that as a proportion of the region's (then much smaller) economic output. This and subsequent spending was partly sustained by the versement transport, a local tax levied on businesses. The tax was introduced in July 1971 and remains in effect. Maps Central network of the RER at a geographically accurate scale Vector map of the network showing the outline of √éle-de-France. Rolling stock The predominance of suburban SNCF track on the RER network explains why RER trains use overhead line power and run on the left, like SNCF trains (except in Alsace-Moselle), contrary to the M√©tro where trains use third rail power and run on the right. RER trains run by the two different operators share the same track infrastructure, a practice called interconnection. On the RER, interconnection required the development of specific trains (MI 79 series for Materiel d'Interconnexion 1979, and MI 2N series for Materiel d'Interconnexion √† 2 niveaux (double-deck interconnection stock)) capable of operating under both 1.5 kV direct current on the RATP network and 25 kV / 50 Hz alternating current on the SNCF network. The MS 61 series (Mat√©riel Suburbain 1961) can be used only on the 1.5 kV DC network. The RER's tunnels have unusually large cross-sections. This is due to a 1961 decision to build according to a standard set by the Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer, with space for overhead catenary power supply to trains. Single-track tunnels measure 6.30 m across and double-track tunnels up to 8.70 m, meaning a cross-sectional area of up to 50 square metres, larger than that of the stations on many comparable underground rail networks. The first RER rolling stock in fact predated the formation of the RER by 40 years, with the Z 23000 stock used on the ligne de Sceaux (which was subsequently integrated into RER B) from 1937 until 27 February 1987. In 1965 the Z 5300 train was introduced, followed by the MS 61 in 1967 (refurbished 1985-1987 and 2006-2009), MI 79 in 1980, MI 84 and Z 8800 in 1985, Z 20500 in 1998, MI 2N in 1996, Z 20900 in 2001 and MI 09 on 5 December 2011. Many services are performed by double-length, double-decker trains.

The six stations of Line A opened between 1969 and 1977 are: *Nation (1969): deep construction at the Place de la Nation. *Charles de Gaulle‚Äì√âtoile (1970): deep construction at the Arc de Triomphe. *La D√©fense (1970): near- surface construction beneath the site of the yet-to-be-built Grande Arche de la D√©fense, just outside the Paris city boundary. *Auber (1971): deep construction near Gare Saint-Lazare. *Ch√¢telet‚ÄìLes Halles (1977): near-surface construction on the site of the former marketplace, claimed in 2017 to be the largest underground station in Europe. *Gare de Lyon (1977): near-surface construction beneath and alongside the main-line SNCF station. Line B station at A√©roport Charles de Gaulle 2. Some controversy followed the construction of the Line A. Using the model of the existing M√©tro, and unlike any other underground network in the world, engineers elected to build the three new deep stations (√âtoile, Auber and Nation) as single monolithic halls with lateral platforms and no supporting pillars. A hybrid solution of adjacent halls was rejected on the grounds that it \\"completely sacrificed the architectural aspect\\" of the oeuvre. The scale in question was vast: the new stations cath√©drales were up to three times longer, wider and taller than M√©tro stations, and hence 20 or 30 times more voluminous. Most importantly, unlike the M√©tro they were to be constructed deep underground. The decision turned out to be expensive: around 8 billion francs for the three stations, equivalent to ‚Ç¨1.2 billion in 2005 terms, with the two-level Auber the costliest of the three. The comparison was obvious and unfavourable with London's Victoria line, a deep line of constructed during the same period using a two-tunnel approach at vastly lower cost. However, the three stations represent undeniable engineering feats and are noticeably less claustrophobic than traditional underground stations. Haussmann - Saint-Lazare on the RER E Only two stations were inaugurated to complete Lines B, C and D: *Gare du Nord (1982): near-surface construction on two levels. *St-Michel - Notre-Dame (1988): deep construction on an existing stretch of the Line B between Luxembourg and Ch√¢telet - Les Halles with two tunnels, common in other underground systems but unique in Paris. The station is situated on and built at the same time as the Luxembourg Ch√¢telet tunnel. Two stations were added to the network as part of Line E in the 1990s. They are notable for their lavishly spacious deep construction, a technique not used since Auber. Although similar to the three 1960s \\"cathedral stations\\" of Line A, their passenger traffic has so far proved vastly lower. *Magenta (1999): deep construction serving both Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est. *Haussmann - Saint- Lazare (1999): deep construction serving Gare Saint-Lazare and Auber. Usage Journey times, particularly on east-west and north-south routes, have been cut by the RER (and thanks to the cross-platform connection at Ch√¢telet - Les Halles, even certain \\"diagonal\\" trips have reduced journey times). Lines A and B reached saturation relatively quickly, exceeding by far all traffic expectations: up to 55,000 passengers per hour in each direction on Line A (1992), the highest such figure outside of East Asia. Despite a frequency of more than one train every two minutes, made possible by the installation of digital signalling in 1989, and the gradual introduction of double-decker trains from 1998 to 2017, the central stations of Line A are critically crowded at peak times. SACEM signalling on the French Wikipedia Used for leisure journeys, the RER has had a major social impact. By bringing far-flung suburbs within easy reach of central Paris, the network has aided the reintegration of the traditionally insular capital with its periphery. The evidence of this social impact can be seen at Ch√¢telet - Les Halles, whose neighbourhood and Forum des Halles leisure and shopping facilities are popular among banlieusards (suburbanites), in particular from eastern suburbs. Future developments Extensions to the RER focus on Line E, which ends at Haussmann - Saint-Lazare, serving only one side of Paris, unlike all other RER lines. Various Line E extensions have been proposed: * westward from Haussmann - St Lazare to Mantes-la-Jolie. Plans for this extension include an eight kilometer bored tunnel from the current western terminus at Haussmann - St Lazare, with new stations at Porte Maillot, La D√©fense, and Nanterre - La Folie, and a connection to the SNCF Normandy line in or near Nanterre, the transfer of the current Line A Poissy service to Line E, and its further extension down the Seine valley to Mantes. * eastward from Chelles-Gournay to Esbly and Meaux * eastward from Tournan to Coulommiers Until the western section is in service, neither of the eastern extensions can be put into service, as the Haussmann - St Lazare station is at maximum capacity because all trains are currently forced to turn around at this station. Once the western extension is in service, Haussmann - St Lazare will become a through station and the eastern extensions will be possible. One of the primary reasons for the completion of Line E through Paris is to relieve overcrowding on Line A, especially during peak commute periods. Plans for the westward extension are in an advanced stage and construction is to begin in 2013, with an inauguration of the new line in 2020. A new Line E station initially proposed at Rue de l'√âvangile (eventually officially called Rosa Parks) on the approach to Gare de l'Est, opened in December, 2015. Air quality The RER has received criticism for its high level of particle pollution during busy periods, essentially due to train braking. Pollution by PM10 particles regularly reaches 400 Œºg/m¬≥ at Auber, substantially more than at neighboring metro stations and eight times the EU Commission's daily average limitEU Directives 1999/30/EC, Annex III and 96/62/EC, the Air Quality Framework Directive of 50 Œºg/m¬≥.

The application layer abstraction is used in both of the standard models of computer networking: the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model. Although both models use the same term for their respective highest level layer, the detailed definitions and purposes are different. Internet protocol suite In the Internet protocol suite, the application layer contains the communications protocols and interface methods used in process-to-process communications across an Internet Protocol (IP) computer network. The application layer only standardizes communication and depends upon the underlying transport layer protocols to establish host-to- host data transfer channels and manage the data exchange in a client-server or peer-to-peer networking model. Though the TCP/IP application layer does not describe specific rules or data formats that applications must consider when communicating, the original specification (in ) does rely on and recommend the robustness principle for application design. OSI model In the OSI model, the definition of the application layer is narrower in scope. The OSI model defines the application layer as the user interface responsible for displaying received information to the user. In contrast, the Internet Protocol Suite does not concern itself with such detail. OSI also explicitly distinguishes additional functionality below the application layer, but above the transport layer at two additional levels: the session layer, and the presentation layer. OSI specifies a strict modular separation of functionality at these layers and provides protocol implementations for each layer.

The WEF hosts an annual meeting at the end of January in Davos, a mountain resort in Graub√ºnden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 business leaders, international political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists for up to five days to discuss global issues, across 500 public and private sessions. The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and India and holds two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates. Beside meetings, the organization provides a platform for leaders from all stakeholder groups from around the world ‚Äì business, government and civil society ‚Äì to collaborate on multiple projects and initiatives. It also produces a series of reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.Pigman. pp. 41‚Äì42. Due to its prominence as an international community of leaders from business, politics, arts and media, the World Economic Forum and particularly its annual meeting in Davos are among others criticised regarding the public cost of security, the formation of a wealthy global elite without attachment points to the broader societies, undemocratic decision processes, gender issues and a lack of financial transparency.

First named the European Management Forum, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts. In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from Western European firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the Davos Congress Centre under the patronage of the European Commission and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.Kellerman. p. 229. Events in 1973, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974. \\"Interview: Klaus Schwab\\" .Financial Times. 22 January 2008.

W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa.

An analysis by The Economist from 2014 found that the vast majority of participants are male and more than 50 years old. Business accounts for most of the participants' background (1,595 conference attendees) with the remaining seats shared between government (364), NGOs (246) and press (234). Academia, which had been the basis of the first annual conference in 1971, had been marginalised to the smallest participant group (183 attendees). Corporate participants Next to individual participants, the World Economic Forum maintains a dense network of corporate partners that can apply for different partnership ranks within the forum. For 2019, Bloomberg has identified a total of 436 listed corporates that participated in the Annual Meeting while measuring a stock underperformance by the Davos participants of c. -10% versus the S&P; 500 during the same year. Drivers are among others an overrepresentation of financial companies and an underrepresentation of fast- growing health care and information technology businesses at the conference.

With increasing limitations on world trade through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially-minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions in China and other large industrial nations.Shaping the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security The World Economic Forum Davos 2017. Retrieved 16 January 2017. Also in 2017, WEF launched the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) for the Earth Initiative, a collaboration among WEF, Stanford University and PwC, and funded through the Mava Foundation. In 2018, WEF announced that one project within this initiative was to be the Earth BioGenome Project, the aim of which is to sequence the genomes of every organism on Earth. The World Economic Forum is working to eliminate plastic pollution, stating that by the year 2050 it will consume 15% of the global carbon budget and will pass by its weight fishes in the world's oceans. One of the methods is to achieve circular economy. The theme of 2020 World Economic Forum annual meeting was \\"Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World\\". Climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion. Many argued that GDP is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsidies should be stopped. Many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed. Al Gore summarized the ideas in the conference as: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be naive, but I want to acknowledge that the center of the global economy is now saying things that many of us have dreamed they might for a long time,‚Äù \\"‚ÄúThe version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed,‚Äù. In this meeting the World Economic Forum: * Launched the Trillion Tree Campaign an initiative aiming to \\"grow, restore and conserve 1 trillion trees over the next 10 years around the world - in a bid to restore biodiversity and help fight climate change\\". Donald Trump joined the initiative. The forum stated that: \\"Nature- based solutions ‚Äì locking-up carbon in the world‚Äôs forests, grasslands and wetlands ‚Äì can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets,\\" adding that the rest should come from the heavy industry, finance and transportation sectors. One of the targets is to unify existing reforestation projects * Discussed the issue of climate change and called to expanding renewable energy, energy efficiency change the patterns of consumption and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The forum claimed that the climate crisis will become a climate apocalypse if the temperature will rise by 2 degree. The forum called to fulfill the commitments in Paris Agreement. Jennifer Morgan the executive director of Greenpeace said that as to the beginning of the forum, fossil fuels still get 3 times more money than climate solutions = Coronavirus and Green recovery = In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to Deforestation and Species loss. In the article, there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global GDP is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery. The forum proposed a plan for a Green recovery. The plan includes advancing Circular economy. Among the mentioned methods, there is Green building, Sustainable transport, Organic farming, Urban open space, Renewable energy and Electric vehicles . = Global Future Councils = The Network of Global Future Councils meets annually in the United Arab Emirates and virtually several times a year. The second WEF annual meeting was held in Dubai in November 2017, when there were 35 distinct councils focused on a specific issue, industry or technology. In 2017 members met with representatives and partners of WEF's new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ideas and proposals are taken forward for further discussion at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters in January. = Future of Work = In regards to the Future of Work, the 2020 WEF set the goal of providing better jobs, access to higher quality education and skills to 1 billion people by 2030. = The Great Reset = In May 2020, the WEF and the Prince of Wales's Sustainable Markets Initiative launched \\"The Great Reset\\" project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \\"The Great Reset\\" will be the theme of WEF's Annual Meeting in January 2021.'The Great Reset: A Unique Twin Summit to Begin 2021', website WEF, 3 June 2020. Criticism Protest march against the WEF in Basel, 2006. During the late 1990s the foundation, along with the G7, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and International Monetary Fund, came under heavy criticism by anti-globalization activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. Ten thousand demonstrators disrupted a regional meeting of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, obstructing the path of two hundred delegates to the meeting.Barret, Bernard (15 November 2000). \\"Beating Up ‚Äì A Report on Police Batons and the News Media at the World Economic Forum, Melbourne, September 2000\\" . [Australian Politics]. Retrieved 24 August 2011. Small demonstrations are held in Davos on most but not all years, organised by the local Green Party (see Anti-WEF protests in Switzerland, January 2003) to protest against what have been called the meetings of \\"fat cats in the snow\\", a tongue-in-cheek term used by rock singer Bono.Noon, Chris (21 January 2006). \\"Bono Teams Up With Amex, Gap For Product Red\\" .

Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of the anti-poverty confederation Oxfam International co- chaired the 2015 meeting, where she presented a critical report of global wealth distribution based on statistical research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute. In this study, the richest one percent of people in the world own forty-eight percent of the world's wealth.Vara, Vauhini (January 2015). Critics of Oxfam‚Äôs Poverty Statistics Are Missing the Point. The New Yorker. Retrieved 27 January 2019. At the 2019 meeting, she presented another report claiming that the gap between rich and poor has only increased. The report ‚ÄúPublic Good or Private Wealth‚Äù stated that 2,200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 percent while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 percent. Oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals.Taylor, Chloe (January 2019).

Retrieved 27 January 2019. =Public cost of security= In September 2018, the city of Davos approved by popular vote to increase the security budget for the yearly meeting to CHF 1.125 million. Later that month, the Swiss house of representatives (Nationalrat) also agreed to increase police and military expenditures to CHF 39 million while the Kanton of Graub√ºnden contributes CHF 2.25 million, the same amount the WEF is paying for security costs.Davos stimmt ab - Mehr Geld f√ºr das WEF(in German) SRF.ch. Retrieved 23 January 2019. The Aargauer Zeitung argued in January 2020 that the actual cost borne by the Kanton Graub√ºnden stand at CHF 9 million per year. =Private vs public meetings= Since the annual meeting in January 2003 in Davos, an Open Forum Davos, which was co-organized by the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches, is held concurrently with the Davos forum, opening up the debate about globalization to the general public. The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders. It is open to all members of the public free of charge.Pigman. p. 130. =\\"Davos Man\\"= \\"Davos Man\\" is a neologism referring to the global elite of wealthy (predominantly) men, whose members view themselves as completely \\"international\\". According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the phrase \\"Davos Man\\",Timothy Garton Ash. Davos man's death wish , The Guardian, 3 February 2005 they are people who \\"have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the √©lite's global operations\\". In his 2004 article \\"Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite\\", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.Samuel Huntington. \\"Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite\\" , The National Interest, Spring 2004 In 2019, the Manager Magazin journalist Henrik M√ºller argued that the \\"Davos Man\\" had already decayed into different groups and camps. He sees three central drivers for this development: * Ideologically: the liberal western model is no longer considered a universal role model that other countries strive for (with China's digital totalitarianism or the traditional absolutism in the Persian Gulf as counter-proposals, all of which are represented by government members in Davos). * Socially: societies increasingly disintegrate into different groups, each of which evokes its own identity (e.g. embodied through the Brexit vote or congressional blockades in the USA). * Economically: the measured economic reality largely contradicts the established ideas of how the economy should actually work (despite economic upswings, wages and prices e.g. barely rise). =Gender debate= Since 2011, the World Economic Forum has been addressing its very own gender quota, to introduce at least one woman for every five senior executives that attended. Female participation increased from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female; this number increased to 21% in 2017, and 24% in 2020, five years of growth.A.

The World Economic Forum has in this context filed legal complaints against at least three investigative articles by reporters Katie Gibbons and Billy Kenber that were published by the British newspaper The Times in March 2020. =Undemocratic decision making= According to the European Parliament's Think Tank, critics see the WEF as an instrument for political and business leaders to 'take decisions without having to account to their electorate or shareholders'. = Lack of financial transparency = In 2017, the former FAZ-Journalist J√ºrgen Dunsch criticized that financial reports of the WEF were not very transparent since neither income nor expenditures were broken down. In addition, he outlined that the foundation capital was not quantified while the apparently not insignificant profits would be reinvested. Recent annual reports published by the WEF include a more detailed breakdown of its financials and indicate revenues of SFr 349 million for the year 2019 with reserves of SFr 310 million and a foundation capital of SFr 34 million. There are no further details provided to what asset classes or individual names the WEF allocates its financial assets of SFr 261 million.http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Annual_Report_18-19.pdf = COVID-19 pandemic coverage = The WEF has a broad coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic by reflecting on scientific findings, government strategies as well as general pandemic and health advice. Some articles published by the WEF at an early stage of the pandemic were written in a very favorable tone regarding the Chinese management of the health crisis. In March 2020, the WEF issued a text highlighting that \\"China has done an incredible job at slowing the spread of the virus\\" and that the WEF's Director for China was \\"impressed to see the delicate balancing act the Chinese government is doing between getting the economy growing again and protecting public health.\\" This was in contrast with criticism elsewhere of the Chinese government's COVID-19 information policy and data accuracy, which had been publicly flagged by a number of Western officials in February. = Selective coverage of protests = Concerning societal bottom-up movements such as the George Floyd protests in the United States or the gilets jaunes movement that originated in France, the World Economic Forum ensures a detailed coverage of underlying protest drivers, views and statistics. This contrasts the representation of movements such as the democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have received comparably marginal attention and have mostly been reviewed in the context of economic risk assessments.

The SIS is used by 31 European countries to find information about individuals and entities for the purposes of national security, border control and law enforcement since 2001. A second technical version of this system, SIS II, went live on 9 April 2013.http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-309_en.pdf  Participating nations  Information in SIS is shared among the institutions of countries participating in the Schengen Agreement Application Convention (SAAC). The five original participating countries were France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Twenty-one additional countries have joined the system since its creation: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Liechtenstein. Among the current participants, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are not members of the European Union. Although Ireland and the United Kingdom have not signed the Schengen Agreement Application Convention, they take part in Schengen co-operation under the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which introduced the provisions of Schengen acquis into European Union law. Schengen acquis allows the United Kingdom and Ireland to take part in all or part of the Schengen convention arrangements. Ireland and the United Kingdom use the Schengen Information System for law enforcement purposes. Ireland and the United Kingdom do not have access to Article 26D (former 96) data because these countries do not intend to remove the border controls between themselves and the rest of Europe. European citizens still have the right of free movement to the UK and Ireland but must pass through a border control point, unlike the other Schengen signatory countries, among whom internal border controls have been largely abolished. Since 1 August 2018, Bulgaria and Romania have full access to SIS; before that they had access to SIS only for law enforcement purposes. Croatia has access to SIS for law enforcement purposes, while Cyprus does not have any access.

History  On 25 March 1957, the Treaty of Rome was completed. On 3 February 1958, the economic union of the Benelux countries was formed. Both agreements aimed to enable the free movement of people and goods across national borders. The Benelux countries, as a smaller group, were able to quickly implement the agreement. The European Communities' focus was on economic integration. It was not until the agreement of Saarbr√ºcken was completed on 13 July 1984, that border controls between France and Germany were eased. On 14 June 1985, France, Germany and three of the Benelux nations completed the Schengen Agreement. Border controls on people and goods between these nations were gradually relaxed. On 19 June 1990, the initial five nations were joined by Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria and five Nordic Passport Union countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. On 21 December 2007, the Schengen border-free zone was enlarged to include Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.  Legal aspects and technical characteristics  SIS was created to maintain European security after 25 March 2001 when border security between fifteen nations was relaxed. The SIS requires Schengen nations to respect the legal force of the information it contains. It also requires the nations to respect the privacy and personal freedom of the people whose data is held according to national data laws. SIS's information processing system must be permanently connected to member nations' databases and must be updated in real-time. These commitments are supplemented by consultation procedures between the member nations. Discussions may take place about issues such as confirmation of information, variation of actions directed by SIS, questions of residency, and international warrants for arrest. SIS is controlled by an authority composed of representatives of the member nations. Personal data protection is a key responsibility. At a technical level, the participating countries adopted a data-processing star architecture made up of a central site containing the reference database, known as C-SIS, for which the responsibility is entrusted to the French Republic by the CAAS, and a site by country, known as N-SIS, containing a copy of the database.  Data  The type of data about people kept in SIS includes: requests for extradition; undesirability of presence in particular territory; minor age; mental illnesses; missing person status; a need for protection; requests by a judicial authority; and suspected of crime. The SIS also keeps data referring to lost, stolen and misappropriated firearms, identity documents, motor vehicles and banknotes. France is responsible for management of SIS and uses an automated system of data updates which occur every five minutes. The SIS automatically directs data to queries arriving via large national databases. Each member nation has an office responsible for SIS communications. SIS also has a function called \\"Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry\\" (SIRENE). The SIRENE office records an \\"hit\\" on a SIS data record and forwards further information to assist investigations.  Police co-operation and legal mutual assistance  In addition to SIS and SIRENE, the Schengen convention ensured police co- operation and legal mutual assistance. Police of member nations can cooperate to prevent and identify crime (article 39); to continue surveillance across borders (article 40); to pursue across borders in certain circumstances (article 41); and to share information that is significant for the repression or the prevention of in flagrante delicto or threats to order and public safety (article 46). This allows execution of criminal judgements and extraditions where a national attempts to take refuge in another territory.  System evolution  In November 2011, SIS1 was renewed for a second time. The main reason for renewal was to connect more nations. In 2007, while developments were in progress, Portugal had offered the use of a version called \\"SISone4ALL\\" developed by SEF (Portugal's Border and Foreigners Service) and Critical Software.SISone4all Critical software.

Brexit With Brexit, the use of the Schengen Information System by the UK is under negotiation, while the EU expects the UK to comply with the EU law to use it. In June 2020, the Security and Intelligence subcommittee of the House of Lords, on hearing evidence by Home Office Minister James Brokenshire, expressed concerns that failure of the (post- Brexit) trade negotiation between the UK and the EU could lead to worrying delays in access to counter-terrorism intelligence.

They are a less lethal alternative to metal projectiles, but can still cause serious injuries such as blindness, permanent disability, and death. Like other similar projectiles made from plastic, wax, and wood, rubber bullets may be used for short range practice and animal control, but are most commonly associated with use in riot control and to disperse protests. Rubber bullets were invented by the British Ministry of Defence for use against rioters in Northern Ireland during The Troubles,New Scientist ‚Äì 3 February 1983. p.292 and were first used there in 1970.A Chronology of the Conflict - August 1970.

Often they were fired directly at people from close range, which resulted in three people being killed and many more being badly injured. Among these injuries, a notable victim was Emma Groves who was blinded in one incident. In 1975, they were replaced by plastic bullets. In Northern Ireland over 35 years (1970‚Äì2005), about 125,000 rubber and plastic bullets were fired‚Äîan average of ten per day‚Äîcausing 17 deaths. The baton round was made available to British police forces outside Northern Ireland from 2001. In 2013 however, Ministry of Defence papers declassified from 1977 revealed it was aware rubber bullets were more dangerous than was publicly disclosed. The documents contained legal advice for the MoD to seek a settlement over a child who had been blinded in 1972, rather than go to court which would expose problems with the bullets and make it harder to fight future related cases. The papers stated that further tests would reveal serious problems with the bullets, including that they were tested \\"in a shorter time than was ideal\\", that they \\"could be lethal\\" and that they \\"could and did cause serious injuries\\". Israeli rubber bullets are produced in two main types. The older type, the standard rubber bullet, is a steel sphere coated in a thin layer of rubber, weighing 14 grams, while the newly improved rubber bullet, introduced in 1989, is a rubber-coated metal cylinder 1.7 cm in diameter, weighing 15.4grams. Of the lethal injuries from this projectile, most are suffered to the head. Smaller rubber bullets are used in riot shotguns and are available in a variety of types. One company, for example, makes both rubber buckshot rounds, containing 15 8.3mm diameter rubber balls per cartridge, and rubber baton rounds, containing a single 4.75-gram projectile. = Self-defense = In some countries, less-lethal guns that fire rubber projectiles may be used by civilians for self-defense. * ‚Äì The civil population and private security guards are allowed to carry less-lethal gas pistols with the ability to fire rubber bullets. * ‚Äì Rubber bullet guns are one of the few firearms that can be owned in the country by private individuals. * ‚Äì Since 1999, the civil population, private security officers, and law control forces in Russia are permitted to use less-lethal weapons.\\"–ü–µ—Ä–µ—á–µ–Ω—å –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤... –°–µ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –≤ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–µ –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏—è... –æ–≥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –±–µ—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ –æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞\\" –ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –†–§ ‚Ññ 179 –æ—Ç 4 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 2005\\"3.1.3. –û–≥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –±–µ—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ –æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Å –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–∞–º–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–≤–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ, –≥–∞–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–æ–∑–≤—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è, —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º–∏ –Ω–æ—Ä–º–∞–º –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏\\" –ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ö –¥–µ–ª –†–§ ‚Ññ 611 –æ—Ç 4 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2006 –≥–æ–¥–∞ \\"–û–± —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—á–Ω–µ–π —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤, –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤, —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ –∏ –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–µ–π –æ–≥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏ –≥–∞–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏—è, –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –∏ –±–æ–µ–ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞—Å–æ–≤ –∫ –Ω–µ–º—É, –Ω–æ—Ä–º –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–º–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–µ–≤—ã—Ö –ø–æ–¥—Ä–∞–∑–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –§–ì–£–ü \\"–û—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∞\\" –ú–í–î –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏\\" A variety of handguns (OSA, \\"Makarych\\", HORHE, etc.) are carried with specially weakened construction and barrel with internal lugs, making use of full-power loads and/or firing hard projectiles impossible, while rubber bullets just compress when passing the lug and so may be fired.

In 1983 it was proved by , and is now known as Faltings's theorem. The conjecture was later generalized by replacing Q by any number field. Background Let C be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g over Q. Then the set of rational points on C may be determined as follows: * Case g = 0: no points or infinitely many; C is handled as a conic section. * Case g = 1: no points, or C is an elliptic curve and its rational points form a finitely generated abelian group (Mordell's Theorem, later generalized to the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem). Moreover, Mazur's torsion theorem restricts the structure of the torsion subgroup. * Case g > 1: according to the Mordell conjecture, now Faltings's theorem, C has only a finite number of rational points. Proofs posed a finiteness conjecture that asserted that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of abelian varieties of fixed dimension and fixed polarization degree over a fixed number field with good reduction outside a given finite set of places. showed that the Mordell conjecture would hold if the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture was true using Parshin's trick. proved the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture using a known reduction to a case of the Tate conjecture, and a number of tools from algebraic geometry, including the theory of N√©ron models. The main idea of Faltings' proof is the comparison of Faltings heights and naive heights via Siegel modular varieties.\\"Faltings relates the two notions of height by means of the Siegel moduli space.... It is the main idea of the proof.\\" =Later proofs= A proof based on diophantine approximation was given by . A more elementary variant of Vojta's proof was given by . Consequences Faltings's 1983 paper had as consequences a number of statements which had previously been conjectured: * The Mordell conjecture that a curve of genus greater than 1 over a number field has only finitely many rational points; * The Isogeny theorem that abelian varieties with isomorphic Tate modules (as Q‚Ñì-modules with Galois action) are isogenous. A sample application of Faltings's theorem is to a weak form of Fermat's Last Theorem: for any fixed n ‚â• 4 there are at most finitely many primitive integer solutions (pairwise coprime solutions) to an + bn = cn, since for such n the Fermat curve xn + yn = 1 has genus greater than 1. Generalizations Because of the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem, Faltings's theorem can be reformulated as a statement about the intersection of a curve C with a finitely generated subgroup Œì of an abelian variety A. Generalizing by replacing C by an arbitrary subvariety of A and Œì by an arbitrary finite-rank subgroup of A leads to the Mordell‚ÄìLang conjecture, which was proved by . Another higher-dimensional generalization of Faltings's theorem is the Bombieri‚ÄìLang conjecture that if X is a pseudo-canonical variety (i.e., a variety of general type) over a number field k, then X(k) is not Zariski dense in X. Even more general conjectures have been put forth by Paul Vojta. The Mordell conjecture for function fields was proved by and by . In 1990, found and fixed a gap in Manin's proof.

Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum unit interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, while the SERF (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.  History  Dr. Cohen's shielded room at MIT, in which first MEG was measured with a SQUID First MEG measured with SQUID, in Dr. Cohen's room at MIT MEG signals were first measured by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before the availability of the SQUID, using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a much better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured. At first, a single SQUID detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject's head. This was cumbersome, and, in the 1980s, MEG manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head. Present-day MEG arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors, covering most of the head. In this way, MEGs of a subject or patient can now be accumulated rapidly and efficiently. Recent developments attempt to increase portability of MEG scanners by using spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers. SERF magnetometers are relatively small, as they do not require bulky cooling systems to operate. At the same time, they feature sensitivity equivalent to that of SQUIDs. In 2012, it was demonstrated that MEG could work with a chip- scale atomic magnetometer (CSAM, type of SERF). More recently, in 2017, researchers built a working prototype that uses SERF magnetometers installed into portable individually 3D-printed helmets, which they noted in interviews could be replaced with something easier to use in future, such as a bike helmet.  The basis of the MEG signal  Synchronized neuronal currents induce weak magnetic fields. The brain's magnetic field, measuring at 10 femtotesla (fT) for cortical activity and 103 fT for the human alpha rhythm, is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment, which is on the order of 108 fT or 0.1 ŒºT. The essential problem of biomagnetism is, thus, the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors, and to the competing environmental noise. Origin of the brain's magnetic field. The electric current also produces the EEG signal.The MEG (and EEG) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synaptic transmission. In accordance with Maxwell's equations, any electrical current will produce a magnetic field, and it is this field that is measured. The net currents can be thought of as current dipoles, i.e. currents with a position, orientation, and magnitude, but no spatial extent. According to the right-hand rule, a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component. To generate a signal that is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci. Researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available. It is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.  Magnetic shielding  Since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas, shielding from external magnetic signals, including the Earth's magnetic field, is necessary. Appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise, respectively. Entrance to MSR, showing the separate shielding layers = Magnetically shielded room (MSR) = A magnetically shielded room (MSR) model consists of three nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1 mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1 Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers. = Active shielding system = Active systems are designed for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2‚Äì3 fT/Hz0.5 above 1 Hz.  Source localization  = The inverse problem = The challenge posed by MEG is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. Problems such as this, where model parameters (the location of the activity) have to be estimated from measured data (the SQUID signals) are referred to as inverse problems (in contrast to forward problems where the model parameters (e.g. source location) are known and the data (e.g. the field at a given distance) is to be estimated.) The primary difficulty is that the inverse problem does not have a unique solution (i.e., there are infinite possible \\"correct\\" answers), and the problem of defining the \\"best\\" solution is itself the subject of intensive research. Possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity. The source models can be either over-determined or under- determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources (\\"equivalent dipoles\\"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated (\\"distributed source solutions\\"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator. One type of localization algorithm for overdetermined models operates by expectation-maximization: the system is initialized with a first guess. A loop is started, in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess. The guess is adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated field and the measured field. This process is iterated until convergence. Another common technique is beamforming, wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior, along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix, to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array (the beamformer) via the Backus-Gilbert inverse. This is also known as a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. When the beamformer is applied to the data, it produces an estimate of the power in a \\"virtual channel\\" at the source location. The extent to which the constraint-free MEG inverse problem is ill-posed cannot be overemphasized. If one's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem. Furthermore, even when a unique inversion is possible in the presence of such constraints said inversion can be unstable. These conclusions are easily deduced from published works. = Magnetic source imaging = The source locations can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to create magnetic source images (MSI). The two sets of data are combined by measuring the location of a common set of fiducial points marked during MRI with lipid markers and marked during MEG with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields. The locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional MEG data onto the structural MRI data (\\"coregistration\\") is possible. A criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an MRI scan: the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty, because of the relatively low spatial resolution of MEG, but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes. However, when the magnetic source image corroborates other data, it can be of clinical utility. = Dipole model source localization = A widely accepted source-modeling technique for MEG involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal. This dipole fitting procedure is non-linear and over- determined, since the number of unknown dipole parameters is smaller than the number of MEG measurements. Automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and MSST (MultiStart Spatial and Temporal) modeling are applied to the analysis of MEG responses. The limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are (1) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ECDs, (2) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance, and (3) dependency on dipole location, especially depth in the brain. = Distributed source models = Unlike multiple-dipole modeling, distributed source models divide the source space into a grid containing a large number of dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for the grid nodes. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of MEG sensors, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined, so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution. The primary advantage of this approach is that no prior specification of the source model is necessary. However, the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret, because they only reflect a \\"blurred\\" (or even distorted) image of the true neuronal source distribution. The matter is complicated by the fact that spatial resolution depends strongly on several parameters such as brain area, depth, orientation, number of sensors etc. = Independent component analysis (ICA) = Independent component analysis (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, facial muscle artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals that may be contaminated with outside noise. However, ICA has poor resolution of highly correlated brain sources.  Use in the field  In research, MEG's primary use is the measurement of time courses of activity. MEG can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster, while functional MRI (fMRI), which depends on changes in blood flow, can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds. MEG also accurately pinpoints sources in primary auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas. For creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, MEG is most often combined with fMRI, as the methods complement each other. Neuronal (MEG) and hemodynamic (fMRI) data do not necessarily agree, in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials (LFP) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. MEG and BOLD signals may originate from the same source (though the BOLD signals are filtered through the hemodynamic response). MEG is also being used to better localize responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible as long as it does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG is also being used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension. Recent studies have reported successful classification of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, chronic alcoholism, facial pain and thalamocortical dysrhythmias. MEG can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects, suggesting a future role of MEG in diagnostics. = Focal epilepsy = The clinical uses of MEG are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on ECoG are considered the gold standard for localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive. Noninvasive MEG localizations of the central sulcus obtained from somatosensory evoked magnetic fields show strong agreement with these invasive recordings. MEG studies assist in clarification of the functional organization of primary somatosensory cortex and to delineate the spatial extent of hand somatosensory cortex by stimulation of the individual digits. This agreement between invasive localization of cortical tissue and MEG recordings shows the effectiveness of MEG analysis and indicates that MEG may substitute invasive procedures in the future. = Fetal = MEG has been used to study cognitive processes such as vision, audition, and language processing in fetuses and newborns. Comparison with related techniques MEG has been in development since the 1960s but has been greatly aided by recent advances in computing algorithms and hardware, and promises improved spatial resolution coupled with extremely high temporal resolution (better than 1 ms). Since the MEG signal is a direct measure of neuronal activity, its temporal resolution is comparable with that of intracranial electrodes. MEG complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and fMRI. Its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to EEG (unless ferromagnetic implants are present), non- invasiveness, use of no ionizing radiation, as opposed to PET and high temporal resolution as opposed to fMRI. = MEG in comparison to EEG = Although EEG and MEG signals originate from the same neurophysiological processes, there are important differences. Magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp, which results in a better spatial resolution of the MEG. Whereas scalp EEG is sensitive to both tangential and radial components of a current source in a spherical volume conductor, MEG detects only its tangential components. Scalp EEG can, therefore, detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri, whereas MEG is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci. EEG is, therefore, sensitive to activity in more brain areas, but activity that is visible in MEG can also be localized with more accuracy. Scalp EEG is sensitive to extracellular volume currents produced by postsynaptic potentials. MEG detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend to cancel out in a spherical volume conductor. The decay of magnetic fields as a function of distance is more pronounced than for electric fields. Therefore, MEG is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity, which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy.

Federal subjects Federal subjects of Russia prior to the addition of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol in 2014 Since 18 March 2014, the Russian Federation consisted of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation.Constitution, Article 65 However, two of these federal subjects‚Äîthe Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol‚Äîare internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation‚Äîtwo delegates each‚Äîin the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). They do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy. There are 6 types of federal subjects‚Äî22 republics, 9 krais, 46 oblasts, 3 federal cities, 1 autonomous oblast, and 4 autonomous okrugs. Autonomous okrugs are the only ones that have a peculiar status of being federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects (with Chukotka Autonomous Okrug being the only exception). =2014 Annexation of Crimea= On 18 March 2014, as a part of the annexation of Crimea and following the establishment of the Republic of Crimea (an independent entity recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol as the constituent members of the Russian Federation.Kremlin.ru. \\"–î–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –º–µ–∂–¥—É –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –∏ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –ö—Ä—ã–º –æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–∏–∏ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫—É—é –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—é –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º –∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å—É–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤\\" (\\"Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on Ascension to the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and on Establishment of New Subjects Within the Russian Federation\\") According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea is accepted as a federal subject with the status of a republic while the City of Sevastopol has received federal city status.

Administrative divisions Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, the administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 17 August 1982 \\"On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR\\".\\"–≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞\\". –°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—è \\"–ê–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ\\". –°–æ—Å—Ç. –ê. –ê. –ò–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤. ‚Äî –ú–Ω.: –ò–∑–¥. –í.–ú. –°—É—Ä–æ–≤, 2001. The 1993 Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the administrative- territorial divisions as the responsibility of the federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the subjects. This was interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of the federal subjects. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized: *administrative districts (raions) *cities/towns and urban-type settlements of federal subject significance *closed administrative-territorial formations Autonomous okrugs and okrugs are intermediary units of administrative divisions, which include some of the federal subject's districts and cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance. *Autonomous okrugs, while being under the jurisdiction of another federal subject, are still constitutionally recognized as federal subjects on their own right. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is an exception in that it is not administratively subordinated to any other federal subject of Russia. *Okrugs are usually former autonomous okrugs that lost their federal subject status due to a merger with another federal subject. Typical lower-level administrative divisions include: *selsoviets (rural councils) *towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance *city districts Municipal divisions In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004‚Äì2005, all federal subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified structure of the municipal government bodies by 1 January 2005, and a law enforcing the reform provisions went in effect on 1 January 2006. According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called \\"municipal formations\\") are as follows: *Municipal district, a group of urban and rural settlements, often along with the inter-settlement territories. In practice, municipal districts are usually formed within the boundaries of existing administrative districts (raions). **Urban settlement, a city/town or an urban-type settlement, possibly together with adjacent rural and/or urban localities **Rural settlement, one or several rural localities *Urban okrug, an urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal district. In practice, urban okrugs are usually formed within the boundaries of existing cities of federal subject significance. *Intra-urban territory (intra-urban municipal formation) of a federal city, a part of a federal city's territory. In Moscow, these are called municipal formations (which correspond to districts); in St. Petersburg‚Äîmunicipal okrugs, towns, and settlements. In Sevastopol (located on the Crimean Peninsula, which is a territory disputed between Russia and Ukraine), they are known as municipal okrugs and a town.Law #17-ZS Territories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as inter-settlement territories. The Federal Law was amended on 27 May 2014 to include new types of municipal divisions: *Urban okrug with intra-urban divisions, an urban okrug divided into intra-urban districts at the lower level of the municipal hierarchy **Intra-urban district, a municipal formation within an urban okrug with intra-urban divisions. This municipal formation type would typically be established within the borders of existing city districts (i.e., the administrative divisions in some of the cities of federal subject significance). In June 2014, Chelyabinsky Urban Okrug became the first urban okrug to implement intra-urban divisions. Federal legislation introduced on May 1, 2019, added an additional territorial unit: *Municipal okrug, a grouping of several settlements without municipal status. Municipal okrugs formally exercise local self-government either through direct means or through electoral and other institutions. Other types of subdivisions =Federal districts= Federal districts of Russia All of the federal subjects are grouped into eight federal districts, each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws. =Economic regions= Economic regions of Russia For economic and statistical purposes the federal subjects are grouped into twelve economic regions. (Russian Classification of Economic Regions (OK 024-95) of January 1, 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. Section II. Economic Regions) Economic regions and their parts sharing common economic trends are in turn grouped into economic zones and macrozones. =Military districts= Military districts of Russia In order for the Armed Forces to provide an efficient management of military units, their training, and other operational activities, the federal subjects are grouped into five military districts. Each military district operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival. Origins Louis Jordan in 1946 Jump blues evolved from the music of big bands such as those of Lionel Hampton and Lucky Millinder. These bands of the early 1940s produced musicians such as Louis Jordan, Jack McVea, Earl Bostic, and Arnett Cobb.Dietsche, pp. 9‚Äì10. Blues and jazz were part of the same musical world, with many accomplished musicians straddling both genres.Wald, p. 198. Jump bands such as the Tympany Five, which came into being at the same time as the boogie-woogie revival, achieved maximum effect with an eight-to-the-bar boogie-woogie style.Dietsche, p. 9. Lionel Hampton recorded the stomping big-band blues song \\"Flying Home\\" in 1942. Featuring a choked, screaming tenor sax performance by Illinois Jacquet, the song was a hit in the \\"race\\" category.Palmer, p. 134. When released, however, Billboard described the tune as \\"an unusually swingy side...with a bright bounce in the medium tempo and a steady drive maintained, it's a jumper that defies standing still\\". Billboard also noted that Benny Goodman had a hand in writing the tune \\"back in the old Goodman Sextet Days\\".Billboard, June 17, 1944, carried an ad (p. 18) listing Goodman as a co- writer. Billboard went on to state that \\"apart from the fact that it is Lionel Hampton's theme, \\"Flying Home\\" is a sure-fire to make the youngsters shed their nickels‚Äîand gladly.\\"Billboard. July 4, 1942. p. 74. Five years later Billboard noted the inclusion of \\"Flying Home\\" in a show that was \\"strictly for hepsters who go for swing and boogie, and beats in loud, hot unrelenting style a la Lionel Hampton....The Hampton band gave with everything, practically wearing itself out with such numbers as 'Hey Bop a Re Bop', 'Hamp Boogie' and 'Flying Home\\"Billboard. July 5, 1947. Both Hampton and Jordan combined the popular boogie-woogie rhythm, a grittier version of swing-era saxophone styles as exemplified by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, and playful, humorous lyrics or verbal asides laced with jive talk. As this urban, jazz-based music became more popular, musicians who wanted to \\"play for the people\\" began favoring a heavy, insistent beat. which appealed to black listeners who no longer wished to be identified with \\"life down home.\\"Palmer, p. 146. Jump groups, employed to play for jitterbugs at a much lower cost than big bands, became popular with agents and ballroom owners. The saxophonist Art Chaney said \\"[w]e were insulted when an audience wouldn't dance\\". Jump was especially popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s, through artists such as Louis Jordan, Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Charles Brown, Helen Humes, T-Bone Walker, Roy Milton, Billy Wright, Wynonie Harris, Louis Prima, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Revival Beginning in the 1980s, jump blues has seen a revival.

The mainly solo vocal with acoustic fingerstyle guitar accompaniment developed in the rural Southern United States in the early 1900s. Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson (Texas), Charley Patton (Mississippi), Blind Willie McTell (Georgia) were among the first to record blues songs in the 1920s. Country blues ran parallel to urban blues, which was popular in cities. Folklorist Alan Lomax was one of the first to use the term and applied it to a field recording he made of Muddy Waters at the Stovall Plantation, Mississippi, in 1941. In 1959, music historian Samuel Charters wrote The Country Blues, an influential scholarly work on the subject. He also produced an album, also titled The Country Blues, with early recordings by Jefferson, McTell, Sleepy John Estes, Bukka White, and Robert Johnson. Charters's works helped to introduce the then-nearly forgotten music to the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and 1960s. The acoustic roots-focused movement also gave rise to the terms \\"folk blues\\" and \\"acoustic blues\\", especially being applied to performances and recordings made around this period. \\"Country blues\\" has also been used to describe regional acoustic styles, such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, or the earliest Chicago, Texas, and Memphis blues.

Major artists in the New Orleans tradition include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim and for swamp blues Slim Harpo and Lightnin' Slim.

Game play  One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other. Which team begins play is determined by \\"flipping the disc\\", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play. That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. The thrower then throws the disc as hard as possible at someone on the opposing team. If the thrower misses the \\"scoring area\\" (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team. The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of \\"tips\\" or \\"bobbles\\", which are rebounds of the disc off receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team. Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points. History The first International Frisbee Tournament was held in Eagle Harbor, Michigan, in 1958. The sport grew from a pastime of the Healy family picnic and, in the 1960s, its national profile was increased by Jim Boggio Sr. As guts evolved during the 1960s, players started throwing faster and faster, until it wasn't unusual to see presumably unbreakable discs traveling at shatter on impact with an unlucky defender's hand. Catching a speeding disc directly was said to really \\"take guts\\", thus the name of the game. One tournament player even required fifteen stitches to close a gaping wound across the palm of his hand. By the early 1970s, the game had spread across the United States and to other countries, with coverage on radio, television, major newspapers, and magazines such as Time.* With over 60 teams at a tournament in the heyday of the game, matches became intensely competitive affairs, seeking the IFT's Julius T. Nachazel Trophy. With radical curving shots, deflected Frisbees bobbled frantically among teammates, and spectacular diving catches, guts had become an extreme sport demanding fast reflexes, physical endurance, and concentration. Since its rise in the 1970s, when even ABC‚Äôs Wide World of Sports was televising guts action, and numerous tournaments were springing up, from Toronto to Chicago and Los Angeles, the sport has gradually declined in popularity in America. Guts had been introduced in Asia by the toy company Wham-O in the 1970s, and by the 1990s it had become even more popular in Japan and Taiwan than in the US. Recent years, however, have seen pockets of strong new American players renewing competitive American interest in the game, also drawing some older players out of ‚Äúretirement‚Äù. Organization Team photo of the German Guts National Team at the 2016 World Championship 2016 London, England The sport's international governing body, as with other major flying disc games, is the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF). For North America, the more game-specific United States Guts Players Association (USGPA) officiates. The fiftieth annual International Frisbee Tournament (IFT), held in Hancock, Michigan, June 30 - July 1, 2007, was a large guts disc tournament, drawing players from all over the United States and Canada, and for the first time, two strong teams from Japan - including ‚ÄúKaton‚Äù, the WFDF World Champions. As of 2007, the USGPA plans to induct some of the most outstanding players into the Guts Hall of Fame, joining Fred Morrison (inventor of the original Pluto Platter flying disc), the Healy brothers (inventors of guts and founders of the IFT), and ‚ÄúSteady Ed‚Äù Headrick (IFT champion and inventor of the standard ‚Äúpole hole‚Äù basket used on modern disc golf courses). Variations =Dodge disc= Dodge disc (or dodge Frisbee). In this variant, scoring is achieved not by throwing into a scoring zone, but by hitting opponents, without their successfully catching the disc. Opponents are permitted to move. As in dodgeball, if a player is hit by a disc and fails to catch it, then the player is \\"out\\" and exits the field of play. If a player catches the thrown disc without its touching the ground, either before or after being hit by it, or before or after it hits another player, then the player who threw the disc is out instead. The game ends when there is only one player left. The game usually ends with a \\"shootout\\" between two players, each with several discs. The final players tend to execute several simultaneous \\"attacks\\" until one is hit without catching a disc thrown by the opponent. A variant of the game, Dodgebee, is a trademark of Hero Discs. The Dodgebee disc is very soft, and thus can be thrown very fast without injuring any of the players. =Flutterguts= Flutterguts is a noncompetitive variant of guts. The two teams face each other a few metres apart. The main rule change is that the disc must be thrown such that it does not rotate about its central axis (i.e. it can flip, but it cannot spin). This restriction makes fast throws impossible, but catching is still challenging.

Most popular from 1948 to 1955, it was a direct precursor to rock and roll and strongly influenced ska. Instrumentation typically includes drums, bass, piano, horns, electric guitar, and vocals. The style is characterized by syncopated \\"second line\\" rhythms, a strong backbeat, and soulful vocals. Artists such as Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, and Fats Domino are representative of the New Orleans R&B; sound.McKnight Mark, \\"Researching New Orleans Rhythm and Blues,\\" Black Music Research Journal 8/1 (1988), 115.  Characteristics  New Orleans rhythm and blues can be characterized by predominant piano, \\"singing\\" horns, and call- and-response elements.Jason Berry, Jonathon Foose, and Tad Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1986), 5. Clear influences of Kansas City Swing bands can be heard through the extensive use of trumpet and saxophone solos.G√©rard Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues, trans. Brigette Debord (Fayetville: University of Arkansas Press, 1997), 154. A \\"double\\" bass line, when the guitar and bass play in unison, was combined with a strong backbeat to make the music easy to dance to. It is also common to hear the influence of Caribbean rhythms such as the mambo, rhumba, and the calypso.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 20. In addition, the usage of blue notes is characteristic. Like most blues, New Orleans R&B; typically follows a standard three-stanza form that contains tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. Within these chords, the three \\"blue notes\\", also known as flatted notes, are the third, fifth, and seventh scale degrees. In New Orleans R&B;, the flatted third is particularly notable.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 70.  Early pioneers  New Orleans rhythm and blues was pioneered by local barrelhouse pianists Champion Jack Dupree, Archibald, and Professor Longhair. Professor Longhair, otherwise known as \\"Fess\\", was considerably influential in the development of the New Orleans R&B; sound. Allen Toussaint, an important figure in New Orleans R&B;, described him as \\"The Bach of Rock 'n' Roll\\".John Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans (Gretna: Pelican, 1974),4. He combined Caribbean and boogie-woogie rhythms to create his signature style. The result was a usage of polyrhythms that he often whistled while playing.McKnight, \\"Researching New Orleans Rhythm and Blues,\\" 115. Although he was admired by other New Orleans musicians, he did not gain national attention until the end of his career.McKnight, \\"Researching New Orleans Rhythm and Blues,\\" 117. During his early career, Longhair visited the Caldonia Inn to listen to Dave Bartholomew's band. When he sat in for Bartholomew's pianist, a large crowd suddenly flooded the venue. He then decided to start his own band called the Four Hairs combo. Soon after, the band recorded their first four tunes at the Hi-Hat club for the Star Talent Label. In 1950, Longhair worked briefly with Mercury Records and recorded \\"Baldheaded\\". The song reached No.5 on Billboard's R&B; chart. Due to financial complications, his work with Mercury was cut short. During the 1950s, he worked with Atlantic Records and recorded \\"Tipitina\\", which at the time was only a local hit, but today is recognized as a New Orleans R&B; classic.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 7. = Professors and barrelhouse pianists = There were two types of local pianists in New Orleans; \\"professor\\" pianists and \\"barrelhouse\\" pianists. Professors were often classically trained and understood music theory. They played in a variety of styles in the brothels of Storyville. Because they were more skilled, audiences expected them play any request that was thrown their way. Notable \\"professor\\" pianists include Buddy Christian, Clarence Williams, Alton Purnell, Spencer Williams, and Jelly Roll Morton. Barrelhouse pianists were often untrained with little to no background in music theory. They were mostly self-taught and played mostly in a blues style. Barrelhouse pianists were considered semi-professional and played for drinks, food, or tips.Jeff Hannusch, I Hear You Knocking' (Ville Platte: Swallow, 1987), 3.  Popular artists  Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, Paul Gayten, Smiley Lewis, Fats Domino, Annie Laurie, and Larry Darnell were the primary artists who achieved national fame.John Broven, \\"Appendix,\\" in Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans (Gretna: Pelican, 1974), pp. 228-237 = Roy Brown = Roy Brown is considered to be one of the pioneers of the New Orleans Urban Blues as one of the first singers to blend elements of gospel into the blues. His \\"crying\\" sound became his signature.Hannusch, I Hear You Knockin' , 71. In March 1947, Cecil Gant heard Brown sing \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" during a set break at a club called the Rainbow Room. Cecil enjoyed the song so much that he had Brown sing it over the phone for De Luxe Records.Hannusch, I Hear You Knockin' , 74. Brown signed a contract with DeLuxe, and recorded the song at J&M; Studio. \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" was an immediate success in New Orleans, and reached the national charts about one year later.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 21. It became his biggest hit, and was successful enough for Brown and his band \\"The Mighty Men\\" to tour across California and the southwestern United States.Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues, 27. \\"Good Rockin' Tonight,\\" made a reappearance in the charts in 1949 after DeLuxe was sold to King Records, who did their best to promote it, something that was not easy because at the time the word \\"rock\\" was a slang for \\"sex\\", which many people believed the song implied.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 23. In 1950, Brown climbed his way up the charts once again with his song \\"Hard Luck Blues\\". Other popular tunes by Roy Brown include \\"Boogie at Midnight\\", \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\", \\"Long About Sundown\\", \\"Cadillac Baby\\", \\"Party Doll\\", \\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\", and \\"Saturday Night\\".Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 24. = Dave Bartholomew = Dave Bartholomew was a bandleader and trumpet player. In the early stages of his career, between 1939 and 1942, he played on the S.S Capitol Riverboat with Fats Pichon. Toward the end of his residency, Pichon resigned to take a solo gig at the Old Absinthe House in New Orleans. Bartholomew took over the riverboat band until he was drafted in 1942. While serving in the army, he learned how to arrange music as a member of the 196th AGF band.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 19. Upon discovering his passion for arranging and band leading, he was eager to return to New Orleans and make a name for himself.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 18. In 1949, Bartholomew and his band recorded the hit song \\"Country Boy\\", while signed with DeLuxe. His true calling however, was to be involved with music production. He established himself as a band leader who arranged, produced, and scouted talent. During the 1950s, Bartholomew co-wrote most of the hits coming out of New Orleans.Herzhaft, Encyclopedia of the Blues, 154-155. = Paul Gayten = Paul Gayten moved with his trio to New Orleans in his early twenties and established a residency at the Club Robin Hood. In 1947, his band recorded the two R&B; hits \\"True (You Don't Love Me)\\" and \\"Since I Fell for You\\" with singer Annie Laurie for DeLuxe. When DeLuxe Records was bought out by King Records, the Braun brothers placed a new focus on Gayten's production skills. Soon after, he became the director for Chess Records.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 76. = Smiley Lewis = Overton Amos Lemons, also known as Smiley Lewis, was known for singing and playing guitar at nearly every venue in New Orleans early in his career. He had an extensive vocal range and a deep voice that could fill a room without any amplification. After the war, he formed a trio with Herman Seals and Tuts Washington. The two became very popular locally. While scouting for talent, the Braun brothers were impressed by Smiley and signed them to DeLuxe in 1947. Three years later, he signed to Imperial Records whom he worked with for ten years. He found moderate success with his songs \\"I Hear You Knockin'\\" and \\"The Bells Are Ringing\\".Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 34. Unfortunately he was overshadowed by Fats Domino who was also signed to Imperial and achieved national recognition for his cover of \\"I Hear You Knockin'\\". Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 72-74. Elvis Presley's hit \\"One Night (of Love)\\", was originally recorded by Lewis and was titled, \\"One Night (of Sin)\\". Similarly, Gale Storm's cover of \\"I Hear You Knockin'\\" made Billboard's Hot 100 Charts. = Fats Domino = In 1949, Dave Bartholomew and Lew Chudd visited the Hideaway Club to listen to Fats Domino sing. They were impressed with his version of \\"Junkers Blues\\" and immediately signed him to Imperial Records.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 34. That same year, Domino did his first recording session at the J&M; studio under the direction of Dave Bartholomew. Of the eight songs that were cut during the session, \\"The Fat Man\\" was chosen as Domino's first big hit. A distinguishing element of the R&B; hit was Domino's horn-like scat singing. Following the success of \\"The Fat Man\\", Domino toured with Jewel King and Dave Bartholomew's band. When his song \\"Goin' Home,\\" reached number one in the R&B; charts in 1952, his status as a star was confirmed.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 32. The biggest hit of his career however, was \\"Blueberry Hill\\". Between the years of 1950 and 1955, he continues to make the R&B; charts over a dozen times.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 36. In 1956, he was the first black artist to make an appearance on the Steve Allen Show. He would later make appearances on the Perry Como Show, The Big Beat, and Dick Clark's American Bandstand.Berry, Foose, and Jones, Up From the Cradle of Jazz, 35-36. Domino's voice was a unique blend of creole intonations, nasal scat singing, and a warm tone. He was known for using triplet piano figures in many of his songs. The \\"New Orleans\\" sound is heard in his cover of Smiley Lewis's \\"Blue Monday\\", with his combination of parade rhythms and barrelhouse blues.Rick Coleman, Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock 'n' Roll (Boston: Da Capo, 2006), 8. Fats Domino was described by Dave Bartholomew as the \\"cornerstone\\" of Rock 'n' Roll.Coleman, Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock 'n' Roll, XVI.  Notable record labels and producers  = Cosimo Matassa = Cosimo Matassa was the leading record producer in New Orleans between 1940 and 1960. He created the \\"cosimo sound\\" with guitar, baritone saxophone, and tenor saxophone doubling the bass line. He also owned J&M; Studio and Jazz City studio, where he recorded nearly all R&B; hits in New Orleans between 1940-1960.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 13. = DeLuxe Records = David and Julian Braun, also known as the Braun brothers, owned an independent record label called \\"DeLuxe\\" which was based in Linden, New Jersey. Seeing that New Orleans was overflowing with talent, they decided to visit the city in 1947 with hopes of singing some new artists.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 17. DeLuxe signed Dave Bartholomew, Paul Gayten, Smiley Lewis, Roy Brown, and Annie Laurie. In 1949 DeLuxe Records was bought out by Syd Nathan, owner of King Records. = Imperial Records = Lew Chudd founded Imperial Records in 1947. During its early years, the label centered around country music and west coast jump bands. Looking to expand his business, Chudd reached out to Dave Bartholomew. They decided that they would work together and explore the up- and-coming R&B; scene. They recorded their first R&B; studio session with Jewel King and Tommy Ridgley at J&M; studio.Broven, Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans, 25-27.

It was especially popular from 1962 to 1964 in two major forms. The first is instrumental surf, distinguished by reverb-heavy electric guitars played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, largely pioneered by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The second is vocal surf, which took elements of the original surf sound and added vocal harmonies, a movement led by the Beach Boys.P. Romanowski, The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Completely Revised and Updated (Simon & Schuster, New York, 2nd edn. rev., 1995), p. 973. Dick Dale developed the surf sound from instrumental rock, where he added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, a spring reverb, and rapid alternate picking characteristics. His regional hit \\"Let's Go Trippin', in 1961, launched the surf music craze, inspiring many others to take up the approach. The genre reached national exposure when it was represented by vocal groups such as the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Dale is quoted on such groups: \\"They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn't surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ... That was the difference ... the real surfing music is instrumental.\\" At the height of its popularity, surf music rivaled girl groups and Motown for the top American popular music trend. It is sometimes referred to interchangeably with the \\"California Sound\\". During the later stages of the surf music craze, many of its groups started to write songs about cars and girls; this was later known as \\"hot rod rock\\".. Instrumental surf =Form= 1963 performance flyer, promoting surf musicians Surf music emerged in the late 1950s as instrumental rock and roll music, almost always in straight 4/4 (common) time, with a medium to fast tempo. The sound was dominated by electric guitars which were particularly characterized by the extensive use of the \\"wet\\" spring reverb that was incorporated into Fender amplifiers from 1961, which was meant to emulate the sound of waves. The outboard separate Fender Reverb Unit that was developed by Fender in 1961 (as opposed to reverb that was incorporated as a built-in amp feature) was the actual first \\"wet\\" surf reverb tone. This unit is the reverb effect heard on Dick Dale records, and others such as \\"Pipeline\\" by the Chantays and \\"Point Panic\\" by the Surfaris. It has more of a wet \\"plucky\\" tone than the \\"built in\\" amp reverb, due to different circuitry. Guitarists also made use of the vibrato arm on their guitars to bend the pitch of notes downward, electronic tremolo effects and rapid (alternating) tremolo picking.A. J. Millard, The Electric Guitar (JHU Press, 2004), p. 129. Guitar models favored included those made by Fender (particularly the Jazzmaster, Jaguar and Stratocaster), Mosrite, Teisco, or Danelectro, usually with single coil pickups (which had high treble in contrast to double-coil humbucking pickups).T. Wheeler, The Stratocaster chronicles: Fender : celebrating 50 years of the Fender Strat (Hal Leonard, 2004), p. 117. Surf music was one of the first genres to universally adopt the electric bass, particularly the Fender Precision Bass. Classic surf drum kits tended to be Rogers, Ludwig, Gretsch or Slingerland. Some popular songs also incorporated a tenor or baritone saxophone, as on the Lively Ones' \\"Surf Rider\\" (1963) and the Revels' \\"Comanche\\" (1961).R. Unterberger, S. Hicks and J. Dempsey, Music USA: the rough guide (Rough Guides, 1999), p. 382. Often an electric organ or an electric piano featured as backing harmony. =History= By the early 1960s, instrumental rock and roll had been pioneered successfully by performers such as Link Wray, Nokie Edwards and the Ventures and Duane Eddy. This trend was developed by Dick Dale, who added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, the distinctive reverb (giving the guitar a \\"wet\\" sound),Ian S. Port, \\"The Birth of Loud: Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock 'n' Roll\\" (Simon and Schuster, 2019), , p. 164 and the rapid alternate picking characteristic of the genre (influenced by Arabic music, which Dale learnt from his Lebanese uncle). His performances at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa, California, during the summer of 1961, and his regional hit \\"Let's Go Trippin' later that year, launched the surf music craze, which he followed up with hits like \\"Misirlou\\" (1962). While Dick Dale was crafting his new sound in Orange County, the Bel-Airs were crafting their own in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County. The band was composed of five teen-aged boys. In 1959 they were still learning to play their instruments: Dick Dodd on drums, Chas Stuart on saxophone, Jim Roberts on piano, and Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson on guitars. Said Johnson of his relationship with Bertrand, \\"Learning the guitar became a duo experience versus a solo thing. We learned to play by playing together, one guy would play the chords, the other would play the lead. This sound would become the basis for the Bel-Airs.\\" They recorded their first single, \\"Mr. Moto\\", in June 1961 (with Richard Delvy on drums instead of Dodd) and the song received radio airplay that summer. Dale was older, played louder, commanded a larger audience, and usually gets credit for creating surf music, but the Bel-Airs lay claim to having the first surf music single. Dick Dale performing in 2005 Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, with Orange County in particular having a strong surf culture, and the Rendezvous Ballroom hosted many surf-styled acts. Groups such as the Bel-Airs (whose hit \\"Mr. Moto\\", influenced by Dale's earlier live performances, was released slightly before \\"Let's Go Trippin), the Challengers (with their album Surfbeat) and then Eddie & the Showmen followed Dale to regional success.J. Blair, The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961‚Äì1965 (Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), p. 2. The Chantays scored a top-ten national hit with \\"Pipeline\\", reaching number four in May 1963. Probably the single-most famous surf tune hit was \\"Wipe Out\\" by the Surfaris, with its intro of a wicked laugh; the Surfaris were also known for their cutting-edge lead guitar and drum solos, and \\"Wipe Out\\" reached number two on the Hot 100 in August 1963 and number 16 in October 1966. The group also had two other global hits, \\"Surfer Joe\\" and \\"Point Panic\\".J. Blair, The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961‚Äì1965 (Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), p. 75. The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand. These included the Astronauts, from Boulder, Colorado; the Trashmen, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, who reached number four with \\"Surfin' Bird\\" in 1964; and the Rivieras, from South Bend, Indiana, who reached number five in 1964 with \\"California Sun\\". the Atlantics, from Sydney, Australia, were not exclusively surf musicians, but made a significant contribution to the genre, the most famous example being their hit \\"Bombora\\", in 1963. Also from Sydney were the Denvermen, whose lyrical instrumental \\"Surfside\\" reached number one in the Australian charts.\\"The Denvermen, Sydney, 1961‚Äì65\\", MILESAGO: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964‚Äì1975, retrieved 18 May 2010. Another Australian surf band who were known outside their own country's surf scene were the Joy Boys, backing band for singer Col Joye; their hit \\"Murphy the Surfie\\" from 1963 was later covered by the Surfaris. European bands around this time generally focused more on the style played by British instrumental rock group the Shadows. A notable example of European surf instrumental is Spanish band Los Rel√°mpagos' rendition of \\"Misirlou\\". The Dakotas, who were the British backing band for Merseybeat singer Billy J. Kramer, gained some attention as surf musicians with \\"Cruel Sea\\", in 1963, which was later covered by the Ventures, and eventually other instrumental surf bands, including the Challengers and the Revelairs.J. Blair, The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961‚Äì1965 (Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), p. 126. Vocal surf =Distinctions= The Beach Boys performing \\"I Get Around\\" in 1964 In Matt Warshaw's The Encyclopedia of Surfing, he notes: \\"Surf music is divided into two categories: the pulsating, reverb-heavy, 'wet'- sounding instrumental form exemplified by guitarist Dick Dale, and the smooth-voiced, multitracked harmonized vocal style invented by the Beach Boys. Purists argue that surf music is by definition instrumental.\\" This second category of surf music was led by the Beach Boys, a group whose main distinction between previous surf musicians was that they projected a world view. In 1964, the group's leader and principal songwriter, Brian Wilson, explained: \\"It wasn't a conscious thing to build our music around surfing. We just want to be identified with the interests of young kids.\\" A year later, he would express: \\"I hate so-called \\"surfin music. It's a name that people slap on any sound from California. Our music is rightfully 'the Beach Boy sound'‚Äîif one has to label it.\\" Vocal surf can be interpreted as a regional variant of doo wop music, with tight harmonies on a song's chorus contrasted with scat singing. According to musicologist Timothy Cooley, \\"Like instrumental surf rock with its fondness for the twelve-bar blues form, the vocal version of Surf Music drew many key elements from African-American genres ... what made the Beach Boys unique was its ability to capture the nation's and indeed the world's imagination about the emerging New Surfing lifestyle now centered in Southern California, as well as the subtle songwriting style and production techniques that identify the Beach Boys' sound.\\" In 1963, Murry Wilson, Brian's father, who also acted as the Beach Boys' manager, offered his definition of surf music: \\"The basis of surfing music is a rock and roll bass beat figuration, coupled with raunch-type weird-sounding lead guitar, an electric guitar, plus wailing saxes. Surfing music has to sound untrained with a certain rough flavor in order to appeal to teenagers. ... when the music gets too good, and too polished, it isn't considered the real thing.\\" Hot rod rock The 1932 Ford that appeared on the cover to the Beach Boys' album, Little Deuce Coupe from 1963 \\"Hot rod music\\" or \\"hot rod rock\\" evolved from surf music. Dick Dale recalled how surf music was re-imagined as hot rod music by a record company-inspired move to capture a larger market. According to The Ultimate Hot Rod Dictionary, by Jeff Breitenstein: \\"While cars and, to a lesser degree, hot rods have been a relatively common and enduring theme in American popular music, the term hot rod music is most often associated with the unique 'California sound' music of the early to mid-1960s ... and was defined by its rich vocal harmonies, amplified (generally Fender brand) electric guitars, and youth-oriented lyrics (most often celebrating hot rods and, more broadly, surfing and 'girls').\\" Author David Ferrandino wrote that \\"the Beach Boys' musical treatments of both cars and surfboards are identical\\", whereas author Geoffrey Himes elaborated on \\"subtle\\" differences: \\"Translating the surf-music format into hot-rod tunes wasn't difficult... If surf music was a lot of Dick Dale and some Chuck Berry, hot-rod music was a little more Berry and a little less Dale ‚Äî i.e. less percussive staccato and more chiming riffs. Instead of slang about waxes and boards, you used slang about carburetors and pistons; instead of name-dropping the top surfing beaches, you cited the nicknames for the top drag-racing strips; instead of warning about the dangers of a 'wipe out', you warned of 'Dead Man's Curve'.\\" =Popularity= In late 1961 the Beach Boys had their first chart hit, \\"Surfin', which peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100, followed by \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" (1963) and \\"Surfer Girl\\" (1963) which reached the top 10. In mid-1962, the group released their major-label debut, \\"Surfin' Safari\\". The song hit number 14 and helped turn the surf rock craze into a national phenomenon. Breitenstein writes that hot rod rock gained national popularity beginning in 1962 with the Beach Boys' \\"409\\", which is often credited with initiating the hot rod music craze, which lasted until 1965. Several key figures led the hot rod movement beside Wilson, including songwriter-producer- musician Gary Usher and songwriter-disc jockey Roger Christian. Wilson then co-wrote \\"Surf City\\" in 1963 for Jan and Dean, and it spent two weeks at the top of the Billboard top 100 chart in July 1963. In the wake of the Beach Boys' success, many singles by new surfing and hot rod groups were produced by Los Angeles groups. Himes notes: \\"Most of these weren't real groups; they were just a singer or two backed by the same floating pool of session musicians: often including Glen Campbell, Hal Blaine and Bruce Johnston. If a single happened to click, a group would be hastily assembled and sent out on tour. It was an odd blend of amateurism and professionalism.\\" One-hit wonders included Bruce & Terry with \\"Summer Means Fun\\", the Rivieras with \\"California Sun\\", Ronny & the Daytonas with \\"G.T.O.\\", and the Rip Chords with \\"Hey Little Cobra\\". The latter two hits both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula was Jan & Dean. Hot rod group the Fantastic Baggys wrote many songs for Jan and Dean and also performed a few vocals for the duo. Decline Like all other rock subgenres of this period, the surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was effectively ended by the British Invasion beginning in early 1964. Hot rod music also ceased to be prominent that year. The emerging garage rock, folk rock, blues rock and later psychedelic rock genres also contributed to the decline of surf rock.J. Blair, The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961‚Äì1965 (Pierian Press, 1985), , p. 9. The Beach Boys survived the invasion by diversifying their approach to music. Brian explained to Teen Beat: \\"We needed to grow. Up to this point we had milked every idea dry ... We had done every possible angle about surfing and then we did the car routine. But we needed to grow artistically.\\" After the decline of surf music, the Beach Boys continued producing a string of hit singles and albums, including the sharply divergent Pet Sounds in 1966. Subsequently, they became the only American rock or pop group that could rival the Beatles. The band only sparingly returned to the hot rod and surfing-themed music, beginning with 1968's \\"Do It Again\\". Influence and revival Instrumental surf rock style guitar was used in the James Bond Theme of the first Bond film Dr. No in 1962, recorded by Vic Flick with the John Barry Seven. The theme became a signature for Bond films and influenced the music of spy films of the 1960s.K. Spencer, Film and television scores, 1950-1979: a critical survey by genre (McFarland, 2008), pp. 61-70. Surf music also influenced a number of later rock musicians, including Keith Moon of the Who, East Bay Ray of the Dead Kennedys, and Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago.M. Vorhees and J. Spelman, Lonely Planet Boston (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2007). pp. 6 and 34. During the mid-to late 1990s, surf rock experienced a revival with surf acts, including Dick Dale recording once more, partly due to the popularity of the movie Pulp Fiction in 1994, which used Dale's \\"Misirlou\\" and other surf rock songs in the soundtrack. =Surf punk= Surf punk is a revival of the original surfing sound. It was initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by groups such as Forgotten Rebels from Canada ‚Äì who released \\"Surfin' on Heroin\\" in 1981 ‚Äì and Agent Orange, from Orange County, who recorded punk cover versions of surf classics such as \\"Misirlou\\", \\"Mr. Moto\\", and \\"Pipeline\\" that same year, with AllMusic's Greg Prato calling the band \\"influential\\" and \\"a step ahead of the rest of the punk/hardcore pack\\". The genre is related to skate punk, which rose to prominence at the same time, in the Orange County beach towns that nurtured the first wave of surf musicians.

Loincloths are commonly used as an undergarment or swimsuit by wrestlers and by farmers in paddy fields in both Sri Lanka and India, where it is called in Sinhala and kaupinam or kov(m)anam or langot. The loincloth, or breechcloth, is a basic form of dress, often worn as the only garment. Men have worn a loincloth as a fundamental piece of clothing which covers their genitals, not the buttocks, in most societies which disapproved of genital nakedness throughout human history. The loincloth is in essence a piece of material, bark-bast, leather, or cloth, passed between the legs and covering the genitals. Despite its functional simplicity, the loincloth comes in many different forms. The Aztecs wore loincloths with or without other garments A breechcloth, or breechclout, consists of a strip of material (bark, cloth, leather) passed between the thighs and secured by a belt. A loincloth is a long piece of cloth, passed between the thighs and wound around the waist. The styles in which breechcloths and loincloths can be arranged are myriad. Both the Bornean sirat and the Indian dhoti have fabric pass between the legs to support a man's genitals. A similar style of loincloth was also characteristic of ancient Mesoamerica. The male inhabitants of the area of modern Mexico wore a wound loincloth of woven fabric. One end of the loincloth was held up, the remainder passed between the thighs, wound about the waist, and secured in back by tucking.Local names: Nahuatl , Mayan .

In many tribes, the flaps hung down in front and back; in others, the breechcloth looped outside the belt and was tucked into the inside, for a more fitted look. Sometimes, the breechcloth was much shorter and a decorated apron panel was attached in front and behind. A Native American woman or teenage girl might also wear a fitted breechcloth underneath her skirt, but not as outerwear. However, in many tribes young girls did wear breechcloths like the boys until they became old enough for skirts and dresses.

The use of breechcloths took on common use by the French canadiens civilians, Metis and Acadians and are mentioned as early as the 1650s. In the 1740s and 50s they were issued to the Canadien as part of their war uniform and in 1755 they even tried to issue them to soldiers from France.‚ÄúDuring their travels across Canada, the French [canadiens] dress as the Indians; they do not wear breeches.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Kalm 1749.‚ÄúThose who go to war receive a capot, two cotton shirts, one breechclout, one pair of leggings, on blanket,one pair of souliers de boeuf, a wood-handled knife, a worm and a musket when they do not bring any.

Its population of 1,481,019 inhabitants (2016) makes it the twelfth most populous city in the country and the centre of Brazil's fifth largest metropolitan area, with 4,405,760 inhabitants (2010). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state. Porto Alegre was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sep√∫lveda, who used the pseudonym Jos√© Marcelino de Figueiredo to hide his identity; but the official date is 1772 with the act signed by immigrants from the Azores, Portugal. The vast majority of the population is of European descent. The city lies on the eastern bank of the Gua√≠ba Lake (usually referred by the city population as Gua√≠ba River), where five rivers converge to form the Lagoa dos Patos (Lagoon of the Ducks), a giant freshwater lagoon navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port as well as a chief industrial and commercial center of Brazil. In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the World Social Forum, an initiative of several non-government organizations. The city became famous for being the first city that implemented participatory budgeting. The 9th Assembly of the World Council of Churches was held in Porto Alegre in 2006. Since 2000, Porto Alegre also hosts one of the world's largest free software events, called FISL. The city was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, having previously been a venue for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. In the middle of 2010s, Porto Alegre had a growing wave of violence, being ranked as 39th among the world's 50 most violent cities in 2017. Nevertheless, the number of violent crimes has been dropping steadily since 2018. History Porto Alegre in 1852 Ot√°vio Rocha Square in 1930 The official date of the foundation of the city of Porto Alegre is 26 March 1772 by Manuel Sep√∫lveda, when Freguesia de S√£o Francisco do Porto dos Casais was created and changed a year later to Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus de Porto Alegre. However, the village started in 1752, when 60 Azorean couples were brought over by the Treaty of Madrid in order to set up Missions at the Northeast Region of Rio Grande do Sul that was handed over to the Portuguese Crown in exchange for the Sacramento Colony located on the margin of the Plata River. Land demarcation took a long time and the Azoreans settled permanently at Porto de Viam√£o, which was the first name by which Porto Alegre went by. On 24 July 1773, Porto Alegre became the capital city of the province, when the administration of Manuel Sep√∫lveda, who used the fictitious name or pseudonym Jos√© Marcelino de Figueiredo, to hide their identity, officially started. In 1824, immigrants from all over the world started arriving, especially German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Jewish, and Lebanese. This mosaic of diversity in appearance, ethnic origin, religions and languages is what makes Porto Alegre, nowadays with nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, a cosmopolitan and multicultural city. The city is an example of diversity and plurality. The capital city of Rio Grande do Sul is also the capital city of the Pampas region, the name given to the region of fauna and flora typical of the vast plains that dominate the landscape of the South of Brazil, part of Argentina and Uruguay. This is where the Ga√∫cho comes from, the historical figure of a brave warrior that fought legendary battles and wars in the quest to conquer the borders of the Kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the 16th century. Porto Alegre in 1970. There were many wars, but it was the nineteenth century that marked its people, after they fought a long war for their independence from the Brazilian Empire. The Farrapos War started with the confrontation in Porto Alegre, near the Azenha bridge on 20 September 1835. Albeit terminated, this conflict etched in the pages of history the myth of the gaucho that is until our days praised in songs and celebrated in annual pageants and honored as names of streets and parks. When the Farrapos War ended, the city continued to develop and underwent strong urban restructuring during the last decades of the 18th century, driven by the accelerated growth of port-related activities and shipyards. Its development continued over time and the city kept abreast with cultural, political and social events that were taking place within Brazil. Porto Alegre is the birthplace of great writers, intellectuals, artists, politicians, and episodes that marked the history of Brazil. The city became known worldwide in 1963 through hosting the World University Games. In 1985, the people of Porto Alegre joined the movement for free elections and one of the largest demonstrations took place in the city. The city Downtown Porto Alegre The city is on a delta resulting from the junction of five rivers, officially called Gua√≠ba Lake (popularly mentioned as a river, too). Although its origins date from the mid-18th century, when immigrants from the Azores settled in the area, the city was officially established in 1742. Porto Alegre is one of the wealthiest cities in Latin America and one of the most diverse. It has welcomed immigrants from all over the world, the largest numbers coming from Portugal, Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. There are also significant Arab and Jewish contingents among its population. The Afro-Brazilian population of the state is concentrated in the city. Before this, Porto Alegre was the port of Viam√£o on the shore of Gua√≠ba Lake. Its previous name was Porto dos Casais (Port of the Couples), and it was initially settled by Azoreans. Many families of settlers came from the city of Rio Grande in the littoral Lagunar region, to the south, a military fortress at that time. Today Rio Grande is the most important port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The city is also known as \\"Porto do Sol\\" (Port of the Sun) and \\"Cidade Sorriso\\" (Smile City). More than 70 neighborhoods (see below) are part of the city and two-thirds of the population are concentrated in the Zona Norte (Northern Zone), where most of the economic activity, including the city center, takes place. Porto Alegre was the seat of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in southern Brazil, it is an important industrial center in the area. It is also a center for ga√∫cho (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its churrasco (barbecue) and chimarr√£o (a strong and hot tea prepared from erva mate). Important Brazilian universities, such as Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Universidade Federal de Ci√™ncias da Sa√∫de de Porto Alegre (UFCSPA) and Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) are there. In 2000, the literacy rate was 97%. The high quality of life is one of the city's main features. Geography Porto Alegre skyline during sunset The city of Porto Alegre is located at the northern end of the large coastal lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos in southeastern Brazil. The city lies on the east bank of the mouth of the Rio Guaiba, the estuary of which forms the enormous freshwater lagoon, Lagoa dos Patos. It additionally serves as the state capital of Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul. Porto Alegre has a long coastline on the Gua√≠ba Lake, and its topography is punctuated by 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, a maze of islands facing the city creates an archipelago where a unique ecosystem gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the native flora of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species. Among these, there are many trees which are vestiges of the Atlantic Forest. Fauna are also diversified, especially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and wooded streets. =Climate= According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, Porto Alegre has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) characterized by its high variability, but with well-defined seasons and evenly distributed rain throughout the year. The presence of Lake Gua√≠ba contributes to increase the humidity of the air.Penter, Camila et alii. \\"Invent√°rio R√°pido da Fauna de Mam√≠feros do Morro Santana, Porto Alegre, RS\\".

Unlike other large Brazilian cities much farther north, notably Bras√≠lia, S√£o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro who observe a pronounced summer maximum in precipitation amounts, the city of Porto Alegre experiences a prominent winter maximum in precipitation values and cloud cover, for the summer season is primarily hot and dry; though evidently high humidity levels often give a distinct mugginess to the air and negatively impacts air quality. Annually Porto Alegre receives an average-total precipitation amount of .

Porto Alegre lies in a transitional area between the subtropical forest and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established to protect native trees. Many of the city's avenues have been planted with different tree species. One striking example of this is Teres√≥polis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found locally. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: \\"Delta do Jacu√≠\\" (Jacu√≠ Delta) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve. The urban area has many parks and plazas, making Porto Alegre one of the greenest provincial capitals in Brazil. The first city squares date from the second half of the 18th century and were originally large public spaces used as food markets. The city has of green space, occupying 31 percent of the city's area. This is an average of 17.6 m2 per person. More than one million trees line the public streets and SMAM plants an average of 30,000 seedlings each year. The four main parks are: Parque Farroupilha, a park; Jardim Bot√¢nico (The Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre), with some 725 species of vegetation on about of land; and Parque Marinha do Brasil (The Brazilian Navy's Park), a vast park of more than which offers a wide variety of sports fields and tracks. The city's cycleway is called the Caminho dos Parques, which at over long links the Moinhos do Vento, Farroupilha and Gua√≠ba shore parks. The Lami Jos√© Lutzenberger Biological Reserve was established in 1975 in the Lami neighborhood of Porto Alegre, named after the local agronomist and environmentalist Jos√© Lutzenberger. It was the first municipal reserve in Brazil. The reserve covers . It reopened in April 2002 after being closed for more than ten years to allow its ecosystems to recover. The reserve conserves nature and supports research and environmental education. =Water= River and the city of Porto Alegre Sewer service is available to 87.7 percent of the city, and 100 percent of the population is serviced by treated water. While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower. Porto Alegre at night. In 2010, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a US$83.2 million to support the Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre. The program will be carried out by the Municipal Department of Management and Strategic Support and will focus on improving water quality in Gua√≠ba Lake and the Cavalhada River, developing urban infrastructure to reduce flood risk along the Cavalhada River, improving the environmental management in the Municipality of Porto Alegre, and promoting efficient municipal water, sanitation and storm drainage services. This program will improve the quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Gua√≠ba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement. The Jacu√≠ estuary contains the Jacu√≠ Delta State Park, which in turn contains the Banhados do Delta Biological Reserve, a fully protected area which covers the islands of P√≥lvora and Pombas. =Air quality= Motor vehicles are responsible for the main atmospheric pollutant emissions. The city has the second worst air quality in Brazil, after only S√£o Paulo. The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time. SMAM (the Municipal Council of the Environment) has encouraged the use of the cleanest fuels and has played a role in monitoring pollution levels. A partnership between SMAM, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, the State Environmental Protection Foundation (FEPAM) and Petrobr√°s has created a network of five air monitoring stations in Porto Alegre. By utilizing a Petrobr√°s product called city diesel, sulphur levels in the air have dropped from 1.2 percent in 1989 to 0.5 percent. Hybrid buses which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of natural gas, the city's taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline. Demographics People of Porto Alegre According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 1,365,039 people residing in the city of Porto Alegre. The census revealed the following numbers: 1,116,659 White people (79.2%), 143,890 Black people (10.2%), 141,411 Pardo (Multiracial) people (10%), 4,062 Asian people (0.3%), 3,308 Amerindian people (0.2%). In 2010, the city of Porto Alegre was the 10th most populous city in Brazil. In 2010, the city had 269,519 opposite-sex couples and 1,401 same-sex couples. The population of Porto Alegre was 53.6% female and 46.4% male. Porto Alegre is mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. Its colonization started in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. From 1748 to 1756, 2,300 Azoreans were sent to the region by the King of Portugal to protect Southern Brazil from neighboring invaders. These colonists, mostly composed of married couples, established the city of Porto dos Casais (literally translated \\"harbor of the couples\\"), nowadays Porto Alegre. In 1775, 55% of Rio Grande do Sul's population was of Azorean Portuguese origin. Porto Alegre was composed mainly of Azoreans and their African slaves until the first half of the 19th century. The first non-Portuguese people to settle Rio Grande do Sul were German immigrants. In 1824, the first immigrants from Germany arrived in Porto Alegre, but they were sent to what is now the city of S√£o Leopoldo ( away). From 1824 to 1914, 50,000 Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul. Most of these colonists had rural communities in the countryside of the State as their first destination. The large rural exodus in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many German-descendants to Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose a large percentage of the population. The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the Italians. They started immigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian Veneto region. As the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the Serra Ga√∫cha region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre. Minority communities of immigrants, such as Central Europeans from Poland and Eastern Europeans from Ukraine and Jews; Arabs from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria; Asians from Japan; as well as Spaniards arriving after the Civil War also made Porto Alegre their home. According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, the ancestral composition of the population of Porto Alegre is: 77.70% European, 12.70% African and 9.60% Native American. = Population growth = ;Changing demographics of the city of Porto Alegre Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.7) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8) ImageSize = width:500 height:230 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:1700000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:500000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:50000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:1800 text:1800 bar:1822 text:1822 bar:1872 text:1872 bar:1890 text:1890 bar:1900 text:1900 bar:1920 text:1920 bar:1940 text:1940 bar:1950 text:1950 bar:1960 text:1960 bar:1970 text:1970 bar:1980 text:1980 bar:1991 text:1991 bar:2000 text:2000 bar:2010 text:2010 bar:2016 text:2016(*) PlotData= color:barra width:20 align:left bar:1800 from:0 till: 6000 bar:1822 from:0 till: 12000 bar:1872 from:0 till: 43998 bar:1890 from:0 till: 52421 bar:1900 from:0 till: 73647 bar:1920 from:0 till: 179263 bar:1940 from:0 till: 272232 bar:1950 from:0 till: 394151 bar:1960 from:0 till: 635125 bar:1970 from:0 till: 885545 bar:1980 from:0 till: 1125477 bar:1991 from:0 till: 1263403 bar:2000 from:0 till: 1360590 bar:2010 from:0 till: 1409351 bar:2016 from:0 till: 1481019 PlotData= bar:1800 at: 6000 fontsize:S text: 6.000 shift:(-8,5) bar:1822 at: 12000 fontsize:S text: 12.000 shift:(-10,5) bar:1872 at: 43998 fontsize:S text: 43.998 shift:(-10,5) bar:1890 at: 52421 fontsize:S text: 52.421 shift:(-10,5) bar:1900 at: 73647 fontsize:S text: 73.647 shift:(-10,5) bar:1920 at: 179263 fontsize:S text: 179.263 shift:(-10,5) bar:1940 at: 272232 fontsize:S text: 272.232 shift:(-10,5) bar:1950 at: 394151 fontsize:S text: 394.151 shift:(-10,5) bar:1960 at: 635125 fontsize:S text: 635.125 shift:(-10,5) bar:1970 at: 885545 fontsize:S text: 885.545 shift:(-10,5) bar:1980 at: 1125477 fontsize:S text: 1.125.477 shift:(-10,5) bar:1991 at: 1263403 fontsize:S text: 1.263.403 shift:(-10,5) bar:2000 at: 1360590 fontsize:S text: 1.360.590 shift:(-10,5) bar:2010 at: 1409351 fontsize:S text: 1.409.351 shift:(-10,5) bar:2016 at: 1481019 fontsize:S text: 1.481.019 shift:(-10,5) TextData= fontsize:S pos:(20,20) text: Source: Planet Barsa Ltda.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a temple in Porto Alegre.Templo de Porto Alegre Brasil Politics, government and citizenship Porto Alegre City Hall The executive branch is represented is by the municipality, its departments and other public administration bodies directly and indirectly. The legislature is represented by the City Council. It hosted the first three editions of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The third edition attracted 20,763 delegates from 130 countries, with a total audience of 100,000 people from all parts of the world. =Participatory budgeting= Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul A feature of public administration in Porto Alegre is the adoption of a system of popular participation in the definition of public investment, called the Participatory Budget. The first full participatory budgeting process was developed in the city starting in 1989. Participatory budgeting in its most meaningful form took place in the city from 1991 to 2004.Baiocchi, Gianpaolo and Ernesto Ganuza. \\"Participatory budgeting as if emancipation mattered\\". In Politics and Society, Vol. 42, No 1, 2014. pp. 29-50 Participatory budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city's residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools). Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre has occurred annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement. Porto Alegre spent about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, This money is subject to participatory budgeting, unlike the annual spending on fixed expenses such as debt service and pensions, which is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre took part at the peak of the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants having grown year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds. Although participatory budgeting appears to continue in the city today, two prominent scholars on the process have stated that \\"after the defeat of the Workers' Party in late 2004, a politically conservative coalition maintained the surface features of PB while returning the actual functioning of the administration to more traditional modes of favor-trading and the favoring of local elites.\\" The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and runs throughout the year in many assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts, dealing with many areas of interest to urban life. The meetings elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend, in order to respond to citizens' concerns. In the following months, delegates meet to review technical project criteria and district needs. Administrative Center of Rio Grande do Sul City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget. The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require, changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened). A World Bank paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, sewer and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986. According to Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy for the establishment of an active citizenship in Brazil. The distribution of investment resources planning that follows a part of the statement of priorities for regional or thematic meetings, culminating with the approval of an investment plan that works and activities program broken down by investment sector, by region and around the city. Also according to Fedozzi, this favors:Fedozzi, Luciano. \\"Esfera p√∫blica e cidadania: a experi√™ncia do Or√ßamento Participativo de Porto Alegre\\". In: Ensaios FEE.

Vol. 3, n. 4 (n√∫mero especial), nov/2007. p. 78 The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999). Economy Convention hall of the Federation of Industries of Rio Grande do Sul (FIERGS) Ipiranga headquarters in Porto Alegre Located at the junction of five rivers, it has become an important alluvial port as well as one of the chief industrial and commercial centers in Brazil. Products of the rich agricultural and pastoral hinterland, such as soybeans, leather, canned beef, and rice, are exported from Porto Alegre to destinations as far away as Africa and Japan. According to SENAES (National Office of Solidarity Economy), it is considered a solidarity economy, the ensemble of economic activities with the following characteristics: cooperation, self-management, economic feasibility and solidarity. In 2005, the office identified 14,954 solidary enterprises in Brazil, among which 85 are located in Porto Alegre. Among the main businesses located in Porto Alegre are Gerdau, Petroleo Ipiranga, Zaffari and RBS. Since 2000, General Motors (GM) is operating in Gravata√≠, located in the Metropolitan Region. Also in this Region but in Triunfo, there is a Petrochemical Pool, and in Eldorado do Sul Dell Computers has established a plant. In the health sector, the three hospitals: Hospital Moinhos de Vento, which is a private, JCAH-accredited hospital, Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital and Clinicas Hospital, public, are considered among the best in Latin America. The latter are university-affiliated, referral hospitals for the South of Brazil. Commerce is a very important economic activity, with many malls (like Praia de Belas Shopping, Shopping Iguatemi and the smaller though posh Shopping Moinhos). The Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre, directed to the production of shoes (around Novo Hamburgo) and to petrochemical industries, as well as services. In the city is located the Electronics Technology Center (CEITEC), focused on the development and production of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), today announced the opening of Latin America's first IC design center. To create state-of-the-art semiconductor products for high-volume markets that will be consumed in Latin America as well as exported to global markets. CEITEC S.A will accelerate the growth of Latin America's electronics industry by leveraging Brazil's regional influence, leadership and economic strength. The company will add 60 engineers to its ranks who will design RFID, digital media and wireless communication chips for its fabrication facility now ramping up for production. The total investment by the Brazilian government is almost US$210 million. The company is implementing a fab-lite strategy with the ability to manufacture analog/digital chips at its facility in Porto Alegre. The in-house design center with more than 100 engineers. Its rural hinterland yields a variety of agricultural and pastoral products, including meat and hides, wool, rice, beans, cashews, avocados, wheat, grapes, and tobacco. From the forests comes lumber. The city's industries are chiefly concerned with processing these products and include meat-packing, lard refining, leather tanning, shipbuilding, and the manufacturing of textiles, metallurgic goods, electrical and communications equipment, plastics, pharmaceuticals, perfume, beer, and chemicals. There are also steel mills, an oil terminal, and a petrochemical complex. Power comes from coal mined at nearby S√£o Jer√¥nimo and from a hydroelectric plant at Salto. The city has many business and financial institutions and is also an educational centre. The GDP for the city was R$30,116,002,000 (2006). The per capita income for the city was R$20,900 (2006). Sustainability programs =Energy= Downtown Porto Alegre at night In Brazil, there are also a few coal-fired plants, fuel-oil fired plants and one nuclear facility. Increased utilization of natural gas and other sources is planned in order to reduce Brazil's overdependence on hydroelectric power. In 1999, a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia to Brazil was completed, with its terminus in Porto Alegre. Brazilian investment group Central Termoeletrica Sul (CTSul) has plans to invest US$698 million in a 650MW coal- fired power generation plant in Cachoeira do Sul, located in Rio Grande do Sul. The largest wind energy park in Brazil, which is being built east of Porto Alegre in Os√≥rio, will add 150 megawatts (MW) to the Brazilian energy matrix. The production represents 5 percent of the energy consumed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and would be sufficient to meet two-thirds of Porto Alegre's energy demands. The Farm opened in 2008 with 75 2MW turbines and has been approved for a 300MW expansion which would make it the largest wind farm in the region. The project is part of the Alternative Energy Sources Program (Proinfa) from state-owned Eletrobr√°s, which will purchase the energy produced for the next 20 years. =Recycling= Porto Alegre was one of the first cities in Brazil to develop a recycling program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the country. The city produces about 1,600 tonnes of household waste per day. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.

Education Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre Educational institutions in the area include Universidade Federal de Ci√™ncias da Sa√∫de de Porto Alegre (a.k.a. UFCSPA), Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (a.k.a. UFRGS), Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio Grande do Sul (a.k.a. PUC), Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (a.k.a. Unisinos) and Centro Universit√°rio Ritter dos Reis. =Educational system= There are three important universities in Porto Alegre: the Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) all of which ranked among the top universities in Brazil and Latin America. UFRGS is also one of the 3 main universities in the country for post-graduation work. The PUCRS technological park ‚Äì TECNOPUC ‚Äì is one of the largest scientific and technological parks in Latin America with interaction of graduate courses, research and innovation. PUCRS is also one of the best universities for air transport and pilot formation in the world. Other very important universities are ULBRA and UNISINOS, among other university centers. Culture =Museums= M√°rio Quintana Culture House Memorial of Rio Grande do Sul Rio Grande do Sul Museum of Art J√∫lio de Castilhos Museum Rio Grande do Sul Museum of Art ‚Äì MARGS With an eclectic style, the building was designed by German architect Theo Wiederspahn. Originally it was the headquarters of the Fiscal Surveillance Agency of the Federal Revenue Office. Nowadays, it hosts the largest public collection of art works in Rio Grande do Sul.Grecco, V., Gomes, P., Golin, C. & Marshall, F. (Orgs.) MARGS 50 Anos. Porto Alegre: MARGS, 2005 J√∫lio de Castilhos Museum Created in 1903, this is the oldest museum in the state. Its collection comprises thousands of pieces related to the local history, from Indian relics to objects and iconography about the Ragamuffin War and the Paraguayan War, including an important section showing fine sculptures from the Jesuitic Reductions. Joaquim Jos√© Felizardo Museum This is an important museum with a large collection of archaeological artifacts and fotographies of Porto Alegre's old times. Its historical building, dating from 1845 to 1855, is one of the few intact relics of colonial architecture inside the modern urban environment. Rio Grande do Sul Memorial This museum displays a huge collection of documents, maps, objects, prints and other items related to the state's history. Its building, designed by Theodor Wiederspahn, is one of the finest examples of eclectic architecture in the city. Iber√™ Camargo Foundation An iconic landmark in the southern part of Porto Alegre, the Iber√™ Camargo Foundation houses the permanent installation of gaucho artist Iber√™ Camargo. It also hosts traveling exhibitions which change several times a year. The building, designed by Portuguese architect √Ålvaro Siza was opened in 2008 and offers views of the Guaiba river as well as downtown Porto Alegre. Luiz Carlos Prestes' Memorial Projected by Oscar Niemeyer, the Luiz Carlos Prestes' Memorial is a recent addition to the city' cultural landscape. Besides the wall presentation of Prestes' life, a hall for cultural, social and political events is placed to the citizens of Porto Alegre. =Carnival/Carnaval= The Porto Alegre Carnival began in the 18th century with the entrudo, a prank brought over by the Portuguese from the Azores, whereby people threw flour, water, and \\"lim√£o de cheiro\\" missiles at each other. At the end of the 19th century, two important Carnival associations were born. Rivalry between the two long dominated the city's Carnival. The corso, a parade of floats down Porto Alegre's streets, was a celebration enjoyed by the more well-to-do of the city's inhabitants. One of the most important Carnival personalities is King Momo. At the beginning of Carnival, usually in February, he receives the keys to the city from the Mayor of Porto Alegre, symbolically governing the Carnival during the four days of revelry. Vincente Rao was the most popular King Momo. =Cuisine= One of the most famous foods of Brazil, churrasco (slow-grilled and -roasted meat), originated in Rio Grande do Sul. But the local cuisine is eclectic, and rice and beans sit on southern tables beside Italian and German dishes, thanks to the South's many European immigrants. Colonial coffee is the elaborate 5 PM tea, with breads, pies, and German kuchen, popular among the Germans in the South. The traditional beverage is chimarrao, a South-American caffeine-rich infused drink. The Chalet of the XV de Novembro Plaza is located along the Gl√™nio Peres Square, it is one of the most traditional bar-draught beer-restaurants in the city, where the last \\"lambe-lambe\\" photographs of the region work. \\"Lambe-lambes\\" are photographers who develop pictures outdoor using the oldest method known. In the Bavarian style, with art nouveau traits, the centenary Chalet was built up on a demountable steel structure, keeping its original chandeliers and tiles even nowadays. Events Brazilian ga√∫cho with typical clothing in the Farroupilha Parade Bookfair in the city A wide range of cultural events are held in Porto Alegre. In addition to the traditional celebrations, a wide variety of activities are organized at Porto Alegre during the different seasons. * World Social Forum: On several occasions (2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) the World Social Forum has been hosted in Porto Alegre. This event gathered more than 100,000 people from more than 100 countries each year. The main aim of these meetings is to discuss and deal with social issues. *Porto Ver√£o Alegre: during the summer, for example, the \\"Porto Ver√£o Alegre\\" or (Porto Summer Alegre) takes place in this city. This celebration consists of a number of performances and exhibitions. In 2005 about seventy plays could be enjoyed. * International Free Software Forum: the F√≥rum Internacional de Software Livre (International Free Software Forum or simply FISL) is an event sponsored by Associa√ß√£o Software Livre (Free Software Association), a Brazilian NGO that, among other objectives, seeks the promotion and adoption of free software. * Farroupilha Week: this cultural celebration takes place in mid September with parades, food and musical exhibitions. The \\"Acampamento Farroupilha\\" takes place in Harmonia Park, where thousands of people set up their tents and eat typical food to commemorate the Farroupilha Revolution. * Bookfair: Held each November at Alf√¢ndega Square.

Among them, there is an Escola de Samba contest, featuring Academia de Samba Puro, Acad√™micos da Orgia, Bambas da Orgia, Estado Maior da Restinga, Fidalgos e Aristocratas, Imp√©rio da Zona Norte, Impeadores do Samba, among others. Transportation =International airport= View from the Salgado Filho International Airport Port of Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport serves commercial flights to most major cities all over Brazil and to smaller cities in the South of the country. There are also international flights to other South American countries, Panama, and Portugal. =Port= The Port of Porto Alegre is situated in the Eastern margin of Gua√≠ba Lake. The port lying on the eastern bank of the Gua√≠ba lake at the point where its waters empty into the huge Lagoa dos Patos is one of Brazil's largest port. Located near the main access roads to Porto Alegre, is away from the Salgado Filho International Airport and has access to the railway station, through the docks of Mau√° and Navegantes. Its geographical position enables a permanent traffic between Porto Alegre and Buenos Aires, transporting steel- industry products and mainly agricultural produce. =Metro= Porto Alegre has a rapid transit system operated by Trensurb, which links downtown Porto Alegre to its northern neighborhoods and to cities to the north of the metropolitan area, as Canoas, Esteio, Sapucaia do Sul, S√£o Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo. The line has stations at strategic spots, such as: the Public Market, the bus station, the airport and many other important and urban spots throughout Porto Alegre and the other cities the metro covers. The line is built at surface level (30 km, totally segregated) and elevated (12 km). Trensurb is operated jointly by the federal government, the state government of Rio Grande do Sul and the city of Porto Alegre through the company Trensurb S.A. (Company of Urban Trains of Porto Alegre S.A.) and has 22 working stations, with a total extension of nearly , carrying about 130,000 users a day. Building of the (sole) Line 1 of the metro started in 1980. The choice of path was made to relieve the heavy traffic of highway BR-116, which already presented serious problems with the transit at the time. The line was inaugurated on March 2, 1985, between the Central Public Market and Sapucaia do Sul. In December 1997, it was extended to Unisinos. An extension of S√£o Leopoldo‚ÄìMuseum was added in November 2000, after two months of trial service. , an extension to Novo Hamburgo is being completed, with the first station already fully functional. A metro system inside Porto Alegre only is currently planned and it is already subject of much publicity and speculation. However, no project has been approved so far and the beginning of the constructions is yet undefined. =Highways= There are two federal highways in the city, BR-290 and BR-116, both running close to its northern and northwestern border. The small number is due to the inexistence of many destinations southeast or south of Porto Alegre (considering the landmass east of Lagoa dos Patos),Villa√ßa, Fl√°vio. Espa√ßo intra-urbano no Brasil. Studio Nobel, 1998, pp. 103-105 if not for the cities of Pelotas (the third-biggest in population in the State) and Rio Grande (which hosts the State biggest port). Nonetheless, when coming from west, both highways bond in the neighbor municipality of Eldorado do Sul, running mostly jointly within the borders of Porto Alegre, only coming to separate at the very interchange to Canoas. This way, BR-116 has virtually no sole run within Porto Alegre. BR-290 highway runs east‚Äìwest across the state, linking the northeast coast of the state to the Uruguay‚ÄìArgentina‚ÄìBrazil border. It runs close to the northern border of the municipality. Coming from west, as it reaches the urban area of Porto Alegre, BR-290 highway becomes a high-standard long freeway that connects to the coast and to the BR-101 highway. The latter is an important way to get to Porto Alegre from the north of the country, by the city Os√≥rio. BR-101 connects to Curitiba, Florian√≥polis and northern Santa Catarina state, and has been recently upgraded to highway standards, with multiple lanes. By entering the BR-290 freeway/BR-101 system, and the other highways it connects to, it is possible to drive from Porto Alegre to as far as Rio de Janeiro or Belo Horizonte almost entirely through 4-lane (or more) highways. The other road, BR-116, is a longitudinal highway, running northeast‚Äìsouth across the state, linking Porto Alegre to several satellite cities and other Brazilian capitals to the north, and Pelotas and Uruguay to the south. Within the municipality, it only touches the northwest side of the city, close to the end of Rio Gravata√≠ (Gravata√≠ River), sharing its entire run with BR-290, only separating when heading north onto Canoas. A third road, BR-448, is currently under construction. BR-448 is planned to connect the northeast of Porto Alegre to Sapucaia do Sul, as an alternative to BR-116, notably jam-packed on its Canoas-Novo Hamburgo stretch during traffic rush hours. The connection between downtown Porto Alegre and the highways is made by Avenida Presidente Castelo Branco (President Castelo Branco Avenue), which is a short - - avenue also bordering the northwest side of the city, Avenida dos Estados (States' Avenue), which is the access way to the Salgado Filho International Airport, and Avenida Assis Brasil (Assis Brasil Avenue), the main Avenue in the northern Porto Alegre. =Bus= Bus in Porto Alegre The city has a functioning transportation system, especially the autobuses. Porto Alegre has also mini-buses from and to all the main neighborhoods in the city, with sitting-only transport and the possibility to hop on and off at any point but also higher fares. Linha Tur√≠stica (Tourist Line) is a bus that leaves from Usina do Gas√¥metro tourist terminal around six times per day. During 90 minutes, it traverses the various districts of Porto Alegre, for a modest price. Exclusive bus lanes in the median of seven radial corridors that converge on the city center are used by both urban and regional lines. The bus fleet totals 1,600, with 150 minibuses. About 325 million people use the system annually. Those lines have no prefix. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but since there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal for the next bus. Transversal lines prefix \\"T\\" (T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different neighborhoods without going through the downtown area, which effectively eliminates the need of changing buses for the most common trips. Circular lines prefix \\"C\\" (C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods. Mayor Jos√© Foga√ßa renewed his agreement with EMBARQ and the Center for Sustainable Transport Brazil (CTS- Brasil) to improve accessibility and mobility in downtown Porto Alegre. The agreement, signed on March 11, includes a new partnership with the Andean Development Corporation, a Latin American multilateral financial institution that is expected to provide $1 million in non-reimbursable technical assistance to help Porto Alegre complete the preparation phase of the \\"Portais da Cidade\\" bus rapid transit project, a groundbreaking transport system designed to reduce pollution and congestion downtown. The system will include a southern extension to accommodate activities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. CAF's technical assistance will be administered through CTS-Brasil, which has been working to expand sustainable transport in Porto Alegre since 2005. The bus station downtown and is served by several national and international lines. It is also connected to a Trensurb station (Porto Alegre Metro) and several municipal bus lines. Northbound passengers can rely on good bus connections throughout Brazil. However, an express bus might be recommended to travel to Uruguay or Argentina to avoid several stops en route. =Taxi= Porto Alegre has a total of 3,922 authorized taxicabs, with 317 taxi stops. Regular taxis are colored red, whereas airport taxicabs are colored white, both with blue strips on the sides containing white lettering. =Public transportation statistics= The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Porto Alegre, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 74 min. 17% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 39% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.3 km, while 14% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License Sports thumb thumb Football is a passion of the people from Porto Alegre. There is a big rivalry between two football clubs, Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense, founded in 1903, and Sport Club Internacional, founded in 1909. Gr√™mio Foot- Ball Porto Alegrense and Sport Club Internacional currently play in the top league in Brazil, the Serie A. Both have successful histories, having won national and international titles, including the South American top honour, the Copa Libertadores, and the highest global trophy for football clubs, the Intercontinental Cup, now known as the Club World Cup. Porto Alegre was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil. The modernization of the Beira-Rio Stadium, home of SC Internacional and the city's 2014 FIFA World Cup venue, left the venue with a capacity for 56,000 spectators. Internacional's former home, the Est√°dio dos Eucaliptos, was a venue for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. Local rivals Gr√™mio play in their own stadium in the Humait√° district. The Arena do Gr√™mio stadium replaced the Est√°dio Ol√≠mpico Monumental in 2012 and meets UEFA/FIFA standards. The Arena do Gr√™mio stadium has a capacity for 60,540 spectators. American football is also played in the city, with two teams: Porto Alegre Pumpkins, the oldest in the state, and Porto Alegre Bulls, who play with the Esporte Clube S√£o Jos√©, a club with multiple sports. On January 22, 2015, Porto Alegre hosted its first Ultimate Fighting Championship event at the Gigantinho. UFC Fight Night: Bigfoot vs. Mir was headlined by former heavyweight champion Frank Mir making his Brazilian debut, knocking out Brasilia native Ant√¥nio Silva. Neighborhoods Neighborhoods of Porto Alegre are geographical divisions of the city.

It was discovered on 9 January 1992 by American astronomer David Rabinowitz (uncredited) of UA's Spacewatch survey at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. The very reddish object has an elongated shape and a rotation period of 9.98 hours. It was named after the creature Pholus from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Orbital diagram of 5145 Pholus Pholus was the second centaur to be discovered. Centaurs are objects in between the asteroid and trans-Neptunian populations of the Solar System that is, beyond Jupiter's and within Neptune's orbit which behave with characteristics of both asteroids and comets. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 8.8‚Äì32.0 AU once every 92 years and 1 month (33,637 days; semi-major axis of 20.39 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.57 and an inclination of 25¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It is a Saturn-, Uranus- and Neptune-crosser, crossing the orbits of these giant planets at a mean-distance of 9.6, 11.9 and 30.1 AU from the Sun, respectively. Pholus has not come within one astronomical unit of a planet since 764 BC, and will not until 5290. It is believed that it originated in the Kuiper belt.  Discovery and naming  Pholus was discovered by David Rabinowitz (not officially credited), working with the Spacewatch program, at Kitt Peak National Observatory on 9 January 1992. Rabinowitz'es discovery was confirmed by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker who identified the object on images they previously took on 1 January 1992. The discovery was announced by James Scotti on 23 January 1992 in an IAU Circular (IAUC 5434) of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. A first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the centaur's observation arc by 15 years prior to its discovery. It was the second discovery of a centaur after 2060 Chiron discovered by Charles Kowal in 1977. In 1993, while with the Spacewatch program, David Rabinowitz went on to discover another centaur, 7066 Nessus. This minor planet was named by the Minor Planet Names Committee for Pholus, a centaur from Greek mythology. As with 2060 Chiron, named after his brother Chiron, the tradition is to name this class of outer planet-crossing objects after the half-human, half-horse mythological creatures. In the mythological account, Pholus died by a self-inflicted wound from a poisoned arrow used by Heracles (see 5143 Heracles), who buried Pholus on the mountain Pholoe. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 July 1992 ().  Physical characteristics  = Spectral type and color = After its discovery, Pholus was quickly found to be very red in color, for which it has been occasionally nicknamed \\"Big Red\\". The color has been speculated to be due to organic compounds on its surface. It is classified as a Z class object on the Tholen taxonomic scheme. The object has been classified by astronomers as RR and RR-U type, respectively. Polarimetric observations with ESO's Very Large Telescope in 2007 and 2008, revealed noticeable negative polarization at certain phase angles, distinctly different from that of trans-Neptunian objects. Pholus appears to have a rather homogeneous surface with small amount of water frost on its darker parts. The surface composition of Pholus has been estimated from its reflectance spectrum using two spatially segregated components: dark amorphous carbon and an intimate mixture of water ice, methanol ice, olivine grains, and complex organic compounds (tholins). The carbon black component was used to match the low albedo of the object. Unlike Chiron, Pholus has shown no signs of cometary activity. = Diameter and albedo = Diameter calculations range from 99 to 190 kilometers with a corresponding albedo between 0.155 and 0.04. According to the Herschel Space Observatory with its PACS instrument, Pholus measures 99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.155, while a study from 1996 derived a diameter of 185 km. During 2003‚Äì2004, observations with the 1.8-meter Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) on Mount Graham Observatory, Arizona, determined an elongated shape, , with a mean-diameter of 190 kilometers, based on a low albedo of 0.04. Johnston's archive lists a diameter of 107 km with an albedo of 0.126, and Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo of a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 165 km based on an absolute magnitude of 7.64. = Rotation period = In March 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Pholus was obtained from photometric observations by Tegler using the VATT at Mount Graham. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 9.980 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.60 magnitude (). Alternative period determinations were also conducted by Hoffmann, Franham and Buie with concurring results of 9.977, 9.982 and 9.983 hours, respectively ().

Here it is applied to the travelling salesman problem to minimize the length of a route that connects all 125 points. Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., the traveling salesman problem). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent, Branch and Bound. The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy. Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems. The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function. Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr.,Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing. This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease towards zero. The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953. Overview The state of some physical systems, and the function E(s) to be minimized, is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state. The goal is to bring the system, from an arbitrary initial state, to a state with the minimum possible energy. hill climb algorithm, as there are many local maxima. By cooling the temperature slowly the global maximum is found.500px =The basic iteration= At each step, the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state s* of the current state s, and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s* or staying in- state s. These probabilities ultimately lead the system to move to states of lower energy. Typically this step is repeated until the system reaches a state that is good enough for the application, or until a given computation budget has been exhausted. =The neighbours of a state= Optimization of a solution involves evaluating the neighbours of a state of the problem, which are new states produced through conservatively altering a given state. For example, in the travelling salesman problem each state is typically defined as a permutation of the cities to be visited, and the neighbors of any state are the set of permutations produced by swapping any two of these cities. The well-defined way in which the states are altered to produce neighboring states is called a \\"move\\", and different moves give different sets of neighboring states. These moves usually result in minimal alterations of the last state, in an attempt to progressively improve the solution through iteratively improving its parts (such as the city connections in the traveling salesman problem). Simple heuristics like hill climbing, which move by finding better neighbour after better neighbour and stop when they have reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead to any of the existing better solutions their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum that could be different. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time. =Acceptance probabilities= The probability of making the transition from the current state s to a candidate new state s_\\\\mathrm{new} is specified by an acceptance probability function P(e, e_\\\\mathrm{new}, T), that depends on the energies e = E(s) and e_\\\\mathrm{new}= E(s_\\\\mathrm{new}) of the two states, and on a global time-varying parameter T called the temperature. States with a smaller energy are better than those with a greater energy. The probability function P must be positive even when e_\\\\mathrm{new} is greater than e. This feature prevents the method from becoming stuck at a local minimum that is worse than the global one. When T tends to zero, the probability P(e, e_\\\\mathrm{new}, T) must tend to zero if e_\\\\mathrm{new} > e and to a positive value otherwise. For sufficiently small values of T, the system will then increasingly favor moves that go \\"downhill\\" (i.e., to lower energy values), and avoid those that go \\"uphill.\\" With T=0 the procedure reduces to the greedy algorithm, which makes only the downhill transitions. In the original description of simulated annealing, the probability P(e, e_\\\\mathrm{new}, T) was equal to 1 when e_\\\\mathrm{new} < e‚Äîi.e., the procedure always moved downhill when it found a way to do so, irrespective of the temperature. Many descriptions and implementations of simulated annealing still take this condition as part of the method's definition. However, this condition is not essential for the method to work. The P function is usually chosen so that the probability of accepting a move decreases when the difference e_\\\\mathrm{new}-e increases‚Äîthat is, small uphill moves are more likely than large ones. However, this requirement is not strictly necessary, provided that the above requirements are met. Given these properties, the temperature T plays a crucial role in controlling the evolution of the state s of the system with regard to its sensitivity to the variations of system energies. To be precise, for a large T, the evolution of s is sensitive to coarser energy variations, while it is sensitive to finer energy variations when T is small. =The annealing schedule= The name and inspiration of the algorithm demand an interesting feature related to the temperature variation to be embedded in the operational characteristics of the algorithm. This necessitates a gradual reduction of the temperature as the simulation proceeds. The algorithm starts initially with T set to a high value (or infinity), and then it is decreased at each step following some annealing schedule‚Äîwhich may be specified by the user, but must end with T=0 towards the end of the allotted time budget. In this way, the system is expected to wander initially towards a broad region of the search space containing good solutions, ignoring small features of the energy function; then drift towards low-energy regions that become narrower and narrower; and finally move downhill according to the steepest descent heuristic. For any given finite problem, the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm terminates with a global optimal solution approaches 1 as the annealing schedule is extended. This theoretical result, however, is not particularly helpful, since the time required to ensure a significant probability of success will usually exceed the time required for a complete search of the solution space. Pseudocode The following pseudocode presents the simulated annealing heuristic as described above. It starts from a state and continues until a maximum of steps have been taken. In the process, the call should generate a randomly chosen neighbour of a given state ; the call should pick and return a value in the range , uniformly at random. The annealing schedule is defined by the call , which should yield the temperature to use, given the fraction of the time budget that has been expended so far. * Let * For through (exclusive): ** ** Pick a random neighbour, ** If : **Output: the final state Selecting the parameters In order to apply the simulated annealing method to a specific problem, one must specify the following parameters: the state space, the energy (goal) function , the candidate generator procedure , the acceptance probability function , and the annealing schedule AND initial temperature . These choices can have a significant impact on the method's effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are no choices of these parameters that will be good for all problems, and there is no general way to find the best choices for a given problem. The following sections give some general guidelines. =Sufficiently near neighbour= Simulated annealing may be modeled as a random walk on a search graph, whose vertices are all possible states, and whose edges are the candidate moves. An essential requirement for the function is that it must provide a sufficiently short path on this graph from the initial state to any state which may be the global optimum the diameter of the search graph must be small. In the traveling salesman example above, for instance, the search space for n = 20 cities has n! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 (2.4 quintillion) states; yet the number of neighbors of each vertex is \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k=\\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=190 edges, and the diameter of the graph is n-1. =Transition probabilities= To investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem, it can be useful to consider the transition probabilities that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm. For each edge (s,s') of the search graph, the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s' when its current state is s. This probability depends on the current temperature as specified by , on the order in which the candidate moves are generated by the function, and on the acceptance probability function . (Note that the transition probability is not simply P(e, e', T), because the candidates are tested serially.) =Acceptance probabilities= The specification of , , and is partially redundant. In practice, it's common to use the same acceptance function for many problems, and adjust the other two functions according to the specific problem. In the formulation of the method by Kirkpatrick et al., the acceptance probability function P(e, e', T) was defined as 1 if e' < e, and \\\\exp(-(e'-e)/T) otherwise. This formula was superficially justified by analogy with the transitions of a physical system; it corresponds to the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm, in the case where T=1 and the proposal distribution of Metropolis‚ÄìHastings is symmetric. However, this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function, which is analogous to the proposal distribution in Metropolis‚ÄìHastings, is not symmetric, or not probabilistic at all. As a result, the transition probabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm do not correspond to the transitions of the analogous physical system, and the long-term distribution of states at a constant temperature T need not bear any resemblance to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution over states of that physical system, at any temperature. Nevertheless, most descriptions of simulated annealing assume the original acceptance function, which is probably hard-coded in many implementations of SA. In 1990, Moscato and Fontanari , and independently Dueck and Scheuer , proposed that a deterministic update (i.e. one that is not based on the probabilistic acceptance rule) could speed-up the optimization process without impacting on the final quality. Moscato and Fontanari conclude from observing the analogous of the \\"specific heat\\" curve of the \\"threshold updating\\" annealing originating from their study that \\"the stochasticity of the Metropolis updating in the simulated annealing algorithm does not play a major role in the search of near-optimal minima\\". Instead, they proposed that \\"the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing.\\" The method subsequently popularized under the denomination of \\"threshold accepting\\" due to Dueck and Scheuer's denomination. In 2001, Franz, Hoffmann and Salamon showed that the deterministic update strategy is indeed the optimal one within the large class of algorithms that simulate a random walk on the cost/energy landscape . =Efficient candidate generation= When choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm, the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state. Therefore, as a general rule, one should skew the generator towards candidate moves where the energy of the destination state s' is likely to be similar to that of the current state. This heuristic (which is the main principle of the Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm) tends to exclude \\"very good\\" candidate moves as well as \\"very bad\\" ones; however, the former are usually much less common than the latter, so the heuristic is generally quite effective. In the traveling salesman problem above, for example, swapping two consecutive cities in a low-energy tour is expected to have a modest effect on its energy (length); whereas swapping two arbitrary cities is far more likely to increase its length than to decrease it. Thus, the consecutive-swap neighbour generator is expected to perform better than the arbitrary-swap one, even though the latter could provide a somewhat shorter path to the optimum (with n-1 swaps, instead of n(n-1)/2). A more precise statement of the heuristic is that one should try first candidate states s' for which P(E(s), E(s'), T) is large. For the \\"standard\\" acceptance function P above, it means that E(s') - E(s) is on the order of T or less. Thus, in the traveling salesman example above, one could use a function that swaps two random cities, where the probability of choosing a city-pair vanishes as their distance increases beyond T. =Barrier avoidance= When choosing the candidate generator one must also try to reduce the number of \\"deep\\" local minima‚Äîstates (or sets of connected states) that have much lower energy than all its neighbouring states. Such \\"closed catchment basins\\" of the energy function may trap the simulated annealing algorithm with high probability (roughly proportional to the number of states in the basin) and for a very long time (roughly exponential on the energy difference between the surrounding states and the bottom of the basin). As a rule, it is impossible to design a candidate generator that will satisfy this goal and also prioritize candidates with similar energy. On the other hand, one can often vastly improve the efficiency of simulated annealing by relatively simple changes to the generator. In the traveling salesman problem, for instance, it is not hard to exhibit two tours A, B, with nearly equal lengths, such that (1) A is optimal, (2) every sequence of city-pair swaps that converts A to B goes through tours that are much longer than both, and (3) A can be transformed into B by flipping (reversing the order of) a set of consecutive cities. In this example, A and B lie in different \\"deep basins\\" if the generator performs only random pair-swaps; but they will be in the same basin if the generator performs random segment-flips. =Cooling schedule= The physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times. Unfortunately, the relaxation time‚Äîthe time one must wait for the equilibrium to be restored after a change in temperature‚Äîstrongly depends on the \\"topography\\" of the energy function and on the current temperature. In the simulated annealing algorithm, the relaxation time also depends on the candidate generator, in a very complicated way. Note that all these parameters are usually provided as black box functions to the simulated annealing algorithm. Therefore, the ideal cooling rate cannot be determined beforehand, and should be empirically adjusted for each problem. Adaptive simulated annealing algorithms address this problem by connecting the cooling schedule to the search progress. Other adaptive approach as Thermodynamic Simulated Annealing, automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states, according to the laws of thermodynamics. Restarts Sometimes it is better to move back to a solution that was significantly better rather than always moving from the current state. This process is called restarting of simulated annealing. To do this we set \`s\` and \`e\` to \`sbest\` and \`ebest\` and perhaps restart the annealing schedule. The decision to restart could be based on several criteria. Notable among these include restarting based on a fixed number of steps, based on whether the current energy is too high compared to the best energy obtained so far, restarting randomly, etc. Related methods * Interacting Metropolis‚ÄìHasting algorithms (a.k.a.

It is the capital of the district G√∂ppingen. G√∂ppingen is home to the toy company M√§rklin, and it is the birthplace of football player J√ºrgen Klinsmann. Geography G√∂ppingen is situated at the bottom of the Hohenstaufen mountain, in the valley of the river Fils. The districts of G√∂ppingen are Bartenbach, Bezgenriet, Faurndau, G√∂ppingen, Hohenstaufen, Holzheim, Jebenhausen and Maitis.  History  Tradition holds that the city was founded by an Alemannic leader called Geppo sometime in the 3rd or 4th century. A disastrous fire on August 25, 1782 destroyed most of the town, but it was immediately rebuilt. Industrialisation during the 19th century made the area into a centre of industry. The importance of such industry is still seen in the town in the present day in companies such as M√§rklin and Schuler. =Jewish community= G√∂ppingen and the nearby village of Jebenhausen were home to a thriving Jewish community from 1777 until the Second World War. In 1777, the Baron von Liebenstein issued a \\"Letter of Protection\\" granting Elias Gutmann and other Jews permission to settle in Jebenhausen. The community grew and peaked in the mid-1800s, with the population center shifting from Jebenhausen to G√∂ppingen and a substantial emigration of Jewish families to America by the late 19th Century. The G√∂ppingen synagogue, constructed in 1881, was destroyed during the Kristallnacht from 9‚Äì10 November 1938. Detailed records of the communities were collected by Rabbi Dr. Aron T√§nzer, who served the community from 1907-1937, and who was also a driving force behind the establishment of the secular city library in G√∂ppingen. A comprehensive Jewish community history, Die Geschichte der Juden in Jebenhausen und G√∂ppingen, was first produced by T√§nzer in 1927, on the 150th anniversary of the settlement of Jebenhausen, and re-released in 1988 by the city of G√∂ppingen with updated material added by Karl-Heinz Ruess. The Jewish Museum in Jebenhausen, opened in 1992, documents and preserves the history of the Jewish community of Jebenhausen and G√∂ppingen. =Cooke Barracks= In 1930, a civilian air field was built north of G√∂ppingen. This was acquired by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in 1935 and expanded into Fliegerhorst Kaserne. From 1945 through 1949, displaced persons and refugees were housed in the kaserne. In 1949, it was renamed Cooke Barracks in honor of Charles H. Cooke, Jr. who had been posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Soldier's Medal for gallantry in action. In late 1950, the VII Corps (US) had been reactivated in Stuttgart and U.S. Army units began to be stationed at Cooke Barracks. The barracks began to be expanded and was used as the 28th Infantry Division headquarters. The 28th Infantry was redesignated as the 9th Infantry Division (United States) in 1954 and was replaced by the 8th Infantry Division in 1956. They were then replaced by the 4th Armored Division in 1957, which was redesignated as the 1st Armored Division in 1971 and moved to Hindenburg Kaserne in Ansbach in 1972. The 1st Infantry Division (Forward) moved from Augsburg in 1972 until they were deactivated in 1991. Cooke Barracks was returned to the German government in 1992.

Voigt eventually went on to head the Mathematical Physics Department at G√∂ttingen and was succeeded in 1914 by Peter Debye, who took charge of the theoretical department of the Physical Institute. In 1921, Debye was succeeded by Max Born. Biography Voigt was born in Leipzig, and died in G√∂ttingen. He was a student of Franz Ernst Neumann. He worked on crystal physics, thermodynamics and electro- optics. His main work was the Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik (textbook on crystal physics), first published in 1910. He discovered the Voigt effect in 1898. The word tensor in its current meaning was introduced by him in 1898. Voigt profile and Voigt notation are named after him. He was also an amateur musician and became known as a Bach expert (see External links). In 1887 Voigt formulated a form of the Lorentz transformation between a rest frame of reference and a frame moving with speed v in the x direction. However, as Voigt himself said, the transformation was aimed at a specific problem and did not carry with it the idea of a general coordinate transformation, as is the case in relativity theory. The Voigt transformation In modern notation Voigt's transformation was :x' = x - vt, :y' = y/\\\\gamma, :z' = z/\\\\gamma, :t' = t - vx/c^2, where \\\\gamma = 1/\\\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}. If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by \\\\gamma, they become the modern Lorentz transformation. Hermann Minkowski said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Also Hendrik Lorentz (1909) is on record as saying that he could have taken these transformations into his theory of electrodynamics, if only he had known of them, rather than developing his own. It is interesting then to examine the consequences of these transformations from this point of view. Lorentz might then have seen that the transformation introduced relativity of simultaneity, and also time dilation. However, the magnitude of the dilation was greater than the now accepted value in the Lorentz transformations. Moving clocks, obeying Voigt's time transformation, indicate an elapsed time \\\\Delta t_\\\\text{Voigt} = \\\\gamma^{-2} \\\\Delta t = \\\\gamma^{-1} \\\\Delta t_\\\\text{Lorentz}, while stationary clocks indicate an elapsed time \\\\Delta t. Lorentz did not adopt this transformation, as he found in 1904 that only the Lorentz contraction corresponds to the principle of relativity. Since Voigt's transformation preserves the speed of light in all frames, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment and the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment can not distinguish between the two transformations. The crucial question is the issue of time dilation. The experimental measurement of time dilation by Ives and Stillwell (1938) and others settled the issue in favor of the Lorentz transformation.

Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and symbolic or cryptic codes such as a crossword or cipher. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as backmasking and steganography, many so-called hidden messages are merely fanciful imaginings or apophany.  Description  The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages, and symbolic or cryptic codes such as a crossword or cipher. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.  Backward audio messages  A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate backmasking, while others are simply phonetic reversals resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, video games, music videos, movies, and television shows. = Backmasking = Backmasking is a recording technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by The Beatles, who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for \\"clean\\" releases of songs. Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record- burnings and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners. = Phonetic reversal = Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their phonemes are reversed‚Äîa process known as phonetic reversal. For example, \\"Kiss\\" backwards sounds like \\"sick\\", and so the title of Yoko Ono's \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss\\" sounds like \\"Sick Sick Sick\\" or \\"Six Six Six\\" backwards. Queen's \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as \\"It's fun to smoke marijuana\\" or \\"start to smoke marijuana\\". The Paul is dead phenomenon was started in part because a phonetic reversal of \\"Number nine\\" (the words were constantly repeated in Revolution 9) was interpreted as \\"Turn me on, dead man\\". According to proponents of reverse speech, phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.  Visual messages  Hidden messages can be created in visual mediums with techniques such as hidden text and steganography. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, \\"Feel the Curves!!\\" An image hidden inside one of the ice cubes was controversial. Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled. Rival PepsiCo had a similar accusation in 1990 when their promotional Pepsi Cool Cans was accused of having the word \\"sex\\" hidden in their design if two of their cans were placed atop each other.https://buffalonews.com/1990/07/12/sex-seen-on-pepsi-cans/ Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in The Little Mermaid.Urban Legends Reference Pages: Disney (Disney Films) According to the Snopes website, one image \\"is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie\\": a topless woman in two frames of The Rescuers.'The Rescuers' Topless Scene : snopes.com PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards PETCO, a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the San Diego Padres baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased naming rights to Petco Park stadium, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: \\"Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!\\" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting acrostic reads \\"BOYCOTT PETCO\\". Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.Rovell, Darren \\"Secret Message Makes it Into New Park\\" ESPN.com 4/16/2004 Secretive design language is widely used on web sites as Easter eggs within products as hidden features, such as In-N-Out Burger's secret menu or the new Norwegian passport design for security.

It is over 14 feet tall and over 9 feet wide (410 x 284 cm; 161.4 x 111.8 in), one in a series of large paintings Dal√≠ did during this era. Description This work is an ambitious homage to Dal√≠'s Spain. It combines Spanish history, religion, art, and myth into a unified whole. It was commissioned for Huntington Hartford for the opening of his Museum Gallery of Modern Art in New York's 2 Columbus Circle. At this time, some Catalan historians were claiming that Columbus was actually from Catalonia, not Italy, making the discovery all the more relevant for Dal√≠, who was also from this region of Spain. The eponymous painting deals with Christopher Columbus's first landing in the New World. It depicts the event metaphorically rather than aiming for historical accuracy. Columbus is depicted not as a middle-aged mariner, but as an adolescent boy in a classical robe to symbolize America as a young continent with its best years ahead of it. Dal√≠, in a period of intense interest in Roman Catholic mysticism at the time, symbolically portrayed Columbus bringing Christianity and the true church to a new world as a great and holy accomplishment. Gala Dal√≠, the painter's wife, whom he often depicted as the Virgin Mary, poses for the role of The Blessed Virgin (or according to some commentators Saint Helena) on the banner in the right hand of Columbus. She appears as a Saint, suggesting that she is Dal√≠'s muse and that she is responsible for his own, \\"Discovery of America\\". Dal√≠ painted himself in the background as a kneeling monk holding a crucifix. Dal√≠'s belief that Columbus was Catalan is represented by the incorporation of the old Catalan flag. The painting contains numerous references to the works of Diego Vel√°zquez (specifically The Surrender of Breda), a Spanish painter who had died 300 years earlier, and who influenced both Dal√≠'s painting and his moustache. Dal√≠ borrows the spears from that painting and places them on the right hand side of his work. Within these spears, Dal√≠ has painted the image of a crucified Christ, which was based on a drawing by the Spanish mystic, St. John. In the bottom center of the painting, on the beach a few steps in front of Columbus, is the bumpy and pockmarked brown sphere of a sea urchin with a curious halo-like ring around it. Current status The painting now hangs in the Salvador Dal√≠ Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida which provides a permanent home for the collection of A. Reynolds Morse & Eleanor R. Morse.

Along with mites, they constitute the subclass Acari. Ticks are external parasites, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks evolved by the Cretaceous period, the most common form of fossilisation being amber immersion. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates. Almost all ticks belong to one of two major families, the Ixodidae or hard ticks, and the Argasidae or soft ticks. Adults have ovoid or pear-shaped bodies, which become engorged with blood when they feed, and eight legs. In addition to having a hard shield on their dorsal surfaces, hard ticks have a beak-like structure at the front containing the mouthparts, whereas soft ticks have their mouthparts on the underside of their bodies. Both families locate a potential host by odour or from changes in the environment. Ticks have four stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid ticks have three hosts, taking at least a year to complete their lifecycle. Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of many serious diseases that affect humans and other animals. Biology =Taxonomy and phylogeny= Fossilised tick in Dominican amber Fossilized ticks are known from the Cretaceous onwards, most commonly in amber. They most likely originated in the Cretaceous (), with most of the evolution and dispersal occurring during the Tertiary ().de la Fuente (2003) The oldest example is an argasid bird tick from Cretaceous New Jersey amber. The younger Baltic and Dominican ambers have also yielded examples that can be placed in living genera. The tick Deinocroton draculi has been found with dinosaur feathers preserved in Cretaceous Burmese amber from . Three families of ticks are described. The two large ones are the sister families of Ixodidae (hard ticks) and Argasidae (soft ticks). The third is the Nuttalliellidae, named for the bacteriologist George Nuttall. It comprises a single species, Nuttalliella namaqua,Guglielmone et al. (2010)Goddard (2008): p. 80 and is the most basal lineage. It is found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.Keirans et al. (1976) Ticks are closely related to the mites, within the subclass Acari. rDNA analysis suggests that the Ixodidae are a clade, but that the Argasidae may be paraphyletic. The Ixodidae contain over 700 species of hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contain about 200 species; the genera accepted are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros, and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The phylogeny of the Ixodida within the Acari is shown in the cladogram, based on a 2014 maximum parsimony study of amino acid sequences of 12 mitochondrial proteins. The Argasidae appear monophyletic in this study. =Range and habitat= Tick species are widely distributed around the world,Magnarelli (2009) but they tend to flourish more in countries with warm, humid climates, because they require a certain amount of moisture in the air to undergo metamorphosis, and because low temperatures inhibit their development from eggs to larvae.Nuttall (1905) Ticks are also widely distributed among host taxa, which include marsupial and placental mammals, birds, reptiles (snakes, iguanas, and lizards), and amphibians. Ticks of domestic animals cause considerable harm to livestock by transmission of many species of pathogens, as well as causing anaemia and damaging wool and hides. Some of the most debilitating species occur in tropical countries. Tropical bont ticks affect most domestic animals and occur in Africa and the Caribbean. The spinose ear tick has a worldwide distribution, the young feeding inside the ears of cattle and wild animals. In general, ticks are to be found wherever their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species. For an ecosystem to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements; the population density of host species in the area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated.Wall & Shearer (2001): p. 55 Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I. scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate ‚Äì such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, and the presence of deer ‚Äì were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations. A habitat preferred by ticks is the interface where a lawn meets the woods, or more generally, the ecotone, which is unmaintained transitional edge habitat between woodlands and open areas. Therefore, one tick management strategy is to remove leaf litter, brush, and weeds at the edge of the woods. Ticks like shady, moist leaf litter with an overstory of trees or at least shrubs, and they deposit their eggs into such places in the spring, so that the larvae can emerge in the fall and crawl into low-lying vegetation. The 3 m of boundary closest to the lawn's edge are a tick migration zone, where 82% of tick nymphs in lawns are found. =Anatomy and physiology= the lone star tick Ticks, like mites, are arthropods that have lost the segmentation of the abdomen (or opisthosoma) that their ancestors had, with a subsequent fusion of the abdomen with the cephalothorax (or prosoma). The tagmata typical of other Chelicerata have been replaced by two new body sections, the anterior capitulum (or gnathosoma), which is retractable and contains the mouthparts, and the posterior idiosoma, which contains the legs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. The capitulum is a feeding structure with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood; it is only the front of the head and contains neither the brain nor the eyes. Features of the capitulum include the basis capitulum, two palps, two cutting chelicerae, and hypostome. The basis capitulum supports the rest of the feeding structures. Palps have a sensory role and are composed of three sections. The hypostome is used for blood extraction and is a hollow, tube-like structure. The ventral side of the idiosoma bears sclerites, and the gonopore is located between the fourth pair of legs. In the absence of segmentation, the positioning of the eyes, limbs, and gonopore on the idiosoma provide the only locational guidance. Most ticks are inornate, meaning they are reddish or mahogany in color and lack markings. However, some species are ornate and have distinctive white patterns on the scutum. Larval ticks hatch with six legs, acquiring the other two after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, each of which has seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents.For Haller's organ, see also: Mehlhorn (2008): p. 582. Ticks can also use Haller's organs to perceive infrared light emanating from a host. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.Sonenshine (2005): p. 14Nicholson et al. (2009): p. 486 In nymphs and adults of the family Ixodidae, the is prominent and projects forwards from the body, a feature not present in the Argasidae. The eyes are close to the sides of the scutum, and the large spiracles are located just behind the coxae of the fourth pair of legs.Molyneux (1993) p. 6 The hard, protective scutellum, characteristic of this family, covers the whole dorsal surface in males, but is restricted to a small, shield-like structure behind the capitulum in females and nymphs. They differ, too, in their lifecycle: Ixodidae that attach to a host can bite painlessly and generally are unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to molt in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs. A soft-bodied tick of the family Argasidae, beside eggs it has just laid The body of the soft tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded anterior portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above, as they are on the ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; often, a centrally positioned dorsal plate is seen, with ridges that project slightly above the surrounding surface, but with no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas shows where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The eyes are on the sides of the body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ in the structure of the genital pore. The Nuttalliellidae can be distinguished from both ixodid and argasid ticks by a combination of a projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, leathery skin. Other distinguishing characteristics include the position of the stigmata, the lack of Roshdy et al. (1983) Ticks are extremely tough, hardy, and resilient animals. They can survive in a near vacuum for as long as half an hour. Their slow metabolism during their dormant periods enables them to go long periods between meals. During droughts, they can endure dehydration without feeding for as long as eighteen weeks, although ticks with limited energy reserves may succumb to desiccation after thirty-six weeks. To keep from dehydrating, ticks hide in humid spots on the forest floor or absorb water from subsaturated air by secreting hygroscopic fluid produced by the salivary glands onto the external mouthparts and then reingesting the water-enriched fluid. Ticks can withstand temperatures just above for more than two hours and can survive temperatures in the range for at least two weeks. Ticks have even been found in Antarctica, where they feed on penguins. =Diet and feeding= A questing tick, fingers for scale Ticks satisfy all of their nutritional requirements as ectoparasites, feeding on a diet of blood. They are obligate hematophages, needing blood to survive and move from one stage of life to another. Ticks can fast for long periods, but eventually die if unable to find a host. This behavior evolved approximately 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. The behavior evolved independently in the separate tick families, with differing host-tick interactions driving the evolutionary change. Some ticks attach quickly, while others wander around looking for thinner skin, such as is found on the ears of mammals. Depending on the species and life stage, preparing to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. It extracts blood by cutting a hole in the host's epidermis, into which it inserts its hypostome and prevents the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.Goddard (2008): p. 82 Ticks find their hosts by detecting animals' breath and body odors, or by sensing body heat, moisture, and vibrations. They are incapable of flying or jumping, but many tick species, particularly Ixodidae, lie in wait in a position known as \\"questing\\". While questing, ticks cling to leaves and grasses by their third and fourth pairs of legs. They hold the first pair of legs outstretched, waiting to grasp and climb on to any passing host. Tick questing heights tend to be correlated with the size of the desired host; nymphs and small species tend to quest close to the ground, where they may encounter small mammalian or bird hosts; adults climb higher into the vegetation, where larger hosts may be encountered. Some species are hunters and lurk near places where hosts may rest. Upon receiving an olfactory or other stimulus, they crawl or run across the intervening surface. Other ticks, mainly the Argasidae, are nidicolous, finding hosts in their nests, burrows, or caves. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to identify hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors. Many of them feed primarily on birds, though some Ornithodoros species, for example, feed on mammals. Both groups feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. None of the species sticks to the host in the way that hard ticks do. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand, in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings, where they come out nightly to attack roosting birds or emerge when they detect carbon dioxide in the breath of their hosts.Allan (2001) Ixodidae remain in place until they are completely engorged. Their weight may increase by 200 to 600 times compared to their prefeeding weight. To accommodate this expansion, cell division takes place to facilitate enlargement of the cuticle. In the Argasidae, the tick's cuticle stretches to accommodate the fluid ingested, but does not grow new cells, with the weight of the tick increasing five- to tenfold over the unfed state. The tick then drops off the host and typically remains in the nest or burrow until its host returns to provide its next meal. Tick saliva contains about 1,500 to 3,000 proteins, depending on the tick species. The proteins with anti- inflammatory properties, called evasins, help ticks to feed for eight to ten days without being perceived by the host animal. Researchers are studying these evasins with the goal of developing drugs to neutralise the chemokines that cause inflammation in myocarditis, heart attack, and stroke. =Ecology= Mites and nematodes feed on ticks, which are also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing. Certain infectious diseases of humans and other animals can be transmitted by ticks, with the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease in this way is enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, or in the case of bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick, but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets, and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack. =Life cycle= Both ixodid and argasid ticks have four lifecycle stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult.Dennis & Piesman (2005): p. 5 Ixodidae = One-host ticks = Eggs laid in the environment hatch into larvae, which immediately seek out a host in which to attach and feed. Fed larvae molt into unfed nymphs that remain on the host. After engorging on the host's blood, the nymphs molt into sexually mature adults that remain on the host in order to feed and mate. Once a female is both fed and ready to lay eggs, only then does she drop off the host in search of a suitable area to deposit her eggs. Ticks that follow this life cycle are called one-host ticks. The winter tick Dermacentor albipictus and the cattle tick Boophilus microplus are examples of one-host ticks.Sonenshine, D. (1991) Biology of Ticks. Oxford University Press, New York. = Two-host ticks = Newly hatched larvae attach to a host in order to obtain a blood meal. They remain on the host after developing into nymphs. After emerging from their shed larval skins, the nymphs reattach to the host and feed. Once engorged, they drop off the host and find a safe area in the natural environment in which to molt into adults. Both male and female adults seek out a host on which to attach, which may be the same body that served as host during their early development. Once attached, they feed and mate. Females ready to lay eggs drop from the host to oviposit in the environment. Ticks that complete their life cycle in this manner are called two-host ticks, like Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum. = Three-host ticks = Most ixodid ticks require three hosts, and their lifecycles take at least a year to complete. Thousands of eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they attach and feed primarily on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their hosts and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then attach and feed on larger hosts before dropping off yet again in order to molt into adults. Adults seek out a third host on which to feed and mate. Female adults engorge on blood and prepare to drop off to lay her eggs on the ground, while males feed very little and remain on the host in order to continue mating with other females. Argasidae Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may go through up to seven nymphal stages (instars), requiring a meal of blood each time.Aeschlimann & Freyvogel, 1995: p. 182 Their lifecycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs over the course of her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process that is unique to argasid ticks. Relationship with humans =Tick-borne disease= A sign in a Lithuanian forest warning of high risk of tick-borne encephalitis infection Ticks are implicated in the transmission of a number of infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Sometimes, the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterial genus Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever, and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick- borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus, and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus. Some species, notably the Australian paralysis tick, are also intrinsically venomous and can cause tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, in which case the larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater, which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over 20 strains of pathogenic viruses were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study. Not all ticks in an infective area are infected with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus, tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. While adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound, there is growing consensus that ticks should be left in situ and frozen with either a custom spray or medical wart remover and left to fall out. Professor Sheryl van Nunen, whose research in 2007 identified tick-induced mammalian meat allergy, has famously said \\"tweezers are tick squeezers\\", referring to the tick toxins squeezed into people by attempting to remove ticks with tweezers. Ticks can be disposed of by flushing them down the toilet, placing them in a container of soapy water or alcohol, or sticking them to tape that can then be folded over and thrown away. Bifenthrin and permethrin, both pyrethroids, are sometimes used as tick- control measures, although a downside is that they are carcinogenic and can attack the nervous systems of other species besides ticks. Those who walk through tick-infested areas can make it harder for ticks to latch onto them by tucking their slacks into boots made of smooth rubber, which ticks have more trouble climbing than other material. Research since 2008 has documented red- meat allergies (known as mammalian meat allergy and Alpha-gal allergy) in the U.S. due to lone star tick bites. The range of the problem has been expanding with the range of the tick. Other species of ticks are known for being responsible for meat allergies in other countries, including Sweden, Germany, and especially Australia, where research by Sheryl van Nunen discovered the existence of the allergy there. Many tick-transmitted viruses, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, are classified as dangerous enough to require biosafety level 4 precautions in laboratory environments. This includes five levels of containment, viz., storage vials within humidified desiccators, within environmental chambers, within a tick suite, within a BSL4 laboratory. Precautions such as glove boxes, sticky pads, Vaseline barriers, safety suits, gloves, sticky tape, silicone vacuum grease, sticky trap paste, and micro mesh are used to safely contain ticks and prevent them from escaping. =Population control measures= Researcher collecting ticks using the \\"tick dragging\\" method With the possible exception of widespread DDT use in the Soviet Union, attempts to limit the population or distribution of disease-causing ticks have been quite unsuccessful.Dennis & Piesman, 2005: p. 3 The parasitoid chalcid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri has been investigated for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill their hosts. Predators and competitors of tick hosts can indirectly reduce the density of infected nymphs, thereby lowering tick-borne disease risk by lowering the density and/or tick burden of reservoir-competent hosts. A study in the Netherlands found that the number of larval ticks on bank voles and wood mice was lower at sites with significant red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and stone marten (Martes foina) activity. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. This supports the results of a study from the northeastern United States, in which the incidence of Lyme borreliosis was negatively correlated with the density of red fox, possibly because foxes decrease the density of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), the most important reservoir-competent host for Borrelia burgdorferi. Another natural form of control for ticks is the guineafowl, a bird species that consumes mass quantities of ticks.Duffy et al. (1992) Opossums also are net destroyers of ticks, killing around ninety percent of the ticks that attempt to feed on them. More generally, high animal diversity has a strongly protective effect against tick-borne disease. Topical tick medicines may be toxic to animals and humans. The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide phenothrin in combination with the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. However, some products have been withdrawn, while others are known to cause adverse reactions.

There is no sharp dividing line between its western dialects and adjacent Northern Low Saxon dialects on the one hand and between its eastern dialects and dialects of Western Pomerania on the other hand. Thus, although the Mecklenburg group is traditionally considered an East Low German group, it is in fact a link between eastern and western dialects. Its Western Slavic substrata do not seem to be as strong as those of dialects spoken farther east.

It was written and directed by Peter Hyams and produced by Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment. It stars Elliott Gould with James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O.J. Simpson as the astronauts. Plot Capricorn One‚Äîthe first crewed mission to Mars‚Äîis on the launch pad. Just before liftoff, the crew of Brubaker, Willis, and Walker are suddenly removed from the spacecraft. Bewildered, they are flown to an abandoned military base in the desert. The launch proceeds on schedule, with the public unaware the spacecraft is empty. At the base, NASA official Kelloway, informs the astronauts that a faulty life-support system would have killed them in-flight. He says they must help counterfeit the televised footage during the flight to and from Mars. Another failed space mission would result in NASA's funding being cut and private contractors losing millions in profits. Kelloway threatens their families to force their cooperation. The astronauts remain captive during the flight and appear to be filmed after landing on Mars, though they are inside a makeshift TV studio at the base. At the command center, only a few officials know about the conspiracy until an alert technician, Elliot Whitter, notices that ground control receives the crew's televised transmissions before the spacecraft telemetry arrives. Whitter reports this to his supervisors, including Kelloway, but is told it is due to a faulty workstation. Whitter partially shares his concerns with a TV journalist friend, Robert Caulfield. Whitter suddenly vanishes, and when Caulfield goes to his apartment the next day, he discovers someone else living there and that all evidence of Whitter's recent life has been erased. As Caulfield investigates, several attempts are made on his life. Upon returning to Earth, the empty spacecraft burns up during atmospheric reentry due to a faulty heat shield. The captive astronauts were supposed to be placed in the returned capsule before being recovered by the Navy. After it is destroyed, they realize officials will never release them. They escape in a small jet which quickly runs out of fuel, forcing a crash- landing in the desert. They split up on foot to increase their chances of finding help and exposing the plot. Kelloway sends helicopters after them; Willis and Walker are found, while Brubaker evades capture. Caulfield interviews Brubaker's \\"widow\\" after reviewing a televised conversation between the astronauts and their wives. Mrs. Brubaker had seemed confused when her husband mentioned their last family vacation. She explains that the family had actually gone to a different location where a western movie was being filmed. Brubaker was intrigued by how special effects and technology made it seem real. Caulfield believes Brubaker would never make such a mistake and may have been sending his wife a message. Caulfield goes to the deserted movie set and is shot at. As he investigates further, federal agents break into his home, arresting him for possessing cocaine that they planted there. His exasperated boss bails Caulfield out, then fires him. A reporter friend tells Caulfield about an abandoned military base located 300 miles from Houston. The base is deserted, but Caulfield finds Brubaker's necklace and medallion and concludes the astronauts were there. Caulfield hires a crop-dusting pilot named Albain to search the desert. They spot and follow two helicopters to a closed isolated gas station where Brubaker is hiding. They rescue him as he attempts to escape his pursuers. The helicopters chase their plane through a canyon but crash when Albain blinds them with crop spray. Ultimately, Caulfield and Brubaker arrive at the astronauts' memorial service, exposing the truth.

Grade agreed to make the film after only five minutes. The budget was $4.8 million.Szebin, 2000Lew Grade, Still Dancing: My Story, William Collins & Sons 1987 p 247 Grade announced the film in October 1975 as a part of a slate of 10 films he intended to make over the next 12 months, including The Domino Principle, Action - Clear the Fast Lanes and Juarez.

The trouble is that this more ideal version is not really struggling to get out but wallowing complacently in the limitless excess that has become the Lew Grade trademark.\\" In a retrospective review, AllMovie critic Donald Guarisco wrote: \\"This agreeable high-concept effort is one of Peter Hyams' most accomplished films. The script's conspiracy-theory premise requires a major suspension of disbelief, but Hyams makes it worthwhile for those willing to make that leap.\\" Other media Two novelizations of the film were written and published by separate authors. The first was written by Ken Follett (under the pseudonym Bernard L. Ross) and published in the United Kingdom; the other was written by Ron Goulart and published in the United States.Allison, 2007. The Follett novel is notable for giving Robert Caulfield more development than the movie does, including giving him something of a relationship with CBS reporter Judy Drinkwater (who has more time in the book than in the movie) and ending the book with him and Judy. The story saves his career and results in his being employed by CBS. Clips from the faked Mars landing scenes have been used for illustration purposes in various Moon landing hoax conspiracy documentaries, notably the Fox TV show Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon and Bart Sibrel's film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon (2001).

As such, it covers a great part of the West Low German-speaking areas of northern Germany, with the exception of the border regions where Eastphalian and Westphalian are spoken, and Gronings dialect in the Netherlands. Dialects Northern Low Saxon can be divided into Holsteinisch, Schleswigsch, East Frisian Low Saxon, Dithmarsisch, North Hanoveranian, Emsl√§ndisch, and Oldenburgisch in Germany,Noble, Cecil A. M.

Some examples are Buscherumpje, a fisherman's shirt, or l√ºttje, a diminutive of l√ºtt, little. Instead the adjective l√ºtt is used, e.g. dat l√ºtte Huus, de l√ºtte Deern, de l√ºtte Jung. There are a lot of special characteristics in the vocabulary, too, but they are shared partly with other languages and dialects, e.g.: *Personal pronouns: ik (like Dutch ik), du (like German Du), he (like English he), se , dat (Dutch dat), wi , ji (similar to English ye, Dutch jij), se . *Interrogatives (English/High German): wo , woans (how/wie), wo laat (how late/wie sp√§t), wokeen (who/wer), woneem (where/wo), wokeen sien / wen sien (whose/wessen) *Adverbs (English/High German): laat (late/sp√§t), gau (fast/schnell), suutje (slowly, carefully/langsam, vorsichtig, from Dutch zoetjes ‚Äònice and easy‚Äô, adverbial diminutive of zoet ‚Äòsweet‚Äô), vigeliensch (difficult, tricky/schwierig) *Prepositions (English/High German): bi (by, at/bei), achter (behind/hinter), v√∂r (before, in front of/vor), blangen (beside, next to, alongside/neben), tw√ºschen (betwixt, between/zwischen), mang, mank (among/unter)  See also  * Languages of Germany  External links  * Plattmakers' Northern Low Saxon dictionary  References  Low German German dialects ","title":"Northern Low Saxon"},{"id":"172282","text":"Murderball may refer to: *Murderball (sport), the original name for wheelchair rugby (known in the U.S. as quad rugby) *Murderball (film), a 2005 documentary about wheelchair rugby co-directed by Henry Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro *Murderball, a character in the film The Violent Kind See also * Killerball (sport) * Killerball (1989 videogame) ","title":"Murderball"},{"id":"172284","text":"Brandenburgish, or Markish, is a dialect spoken in Germany in the northern and western parts of Brandenburg (Uckermark, Prignitz and Mittelmark regions) as well as in northern Saxony-Anhalt (Altmark).

It was originally intended as a chronicle of the daily life of the Louds, an upper middle class family in Santa Barbara, California, but ended up documenting the break-up of the family via the separation and subsequent divorce of parents Bill and Pat Loud.Cf. Loud, Pat, Pat Loud: A Woman's Story, 1974 A year after this program was broadcast, the BBC in 1974 filmed its own similar 12-episode program, called The Family, focusing on the working-class Wilkins family, of Reading, Berkshire, England. Series In 2011, The New York Times reflected on some of the controversy the series engendered: The show included footage of intimate family interactions, including an on-camera separation demand from wife Pat to her husband, and the coming-out of one of the children, who was gay. Producers conducted 300 hours of filming over seven months in 1971 on a budget of $1.2 million. In 2002, An American Family was listed at #32 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time list. It is the earliest example of the reality television genre. Synopsis The Loud family members profiled were: * Bill Loud (born 1921))Cf. episode \\"Going Back Home\\"Cf. episode \\"An American Family: an introduction\\" narrated by producer Craig Gilbert, January 1, 1973 * Pat Loud (born 1926) * Lance Loud (born 1951) * Kevin Robert Loud (born 1953) * Grant Loud (born 1954) * Delilah Ann Loud (born 1955) * Michele Loud (born 1957) Lance Loud is credited as the first continuing character on television who was openly gayPBS.org - An American Family and subsequently became an icon within the LGBT community. He later became a columnist for the national LGBT news magazine The Advocate. One of the more notable moments of the series was when, after 21 years of marriage, Pat asked Bill for a divorce and to leave the house. Pat's saying to her husband \\"You know there's a problem\\" - with Bill's response, \\"What's your problem?\\" - was chosen as one of the Top 100 Television Moments by TV Guide. The series drew over 10 million viewers and considerable controversy. The family was featured in Newsweek on March 12, 1973, in the article \\"The Broken Family\\". Legacy and influence In 1974, the BBC made its own similar program, called The Family. The program consisted of 12 half-hour episodes, showing the daily lives and concerns of the working-class Wilkins family, of Reading, Berkshire, England. The series inspired a 1977 story arc in the satirical soap opera Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman in which a television crew for The David Susskind Show documents the daily life of the titular character as the \\"typical American consumer housewife\\". In 1979, Albert Brooks spoofed the series in his film Real Life.Roberts, Michael. \\"The Unreal World\\" . Denver Westword. March 14, 1996 In 1983, HBO broadcast An American Family Revisited: The Louds 10 Years Later. The 1985‚Äì88 mockumentary series of TV films The History of White People in America and Portrait of a White Marriage parody the series in following the lives of a dysfunctional white suburban family led by Fred Willard and Mary Kay Place. The series inspired the MTV reality television series The Real World. In 2003, PBS broadcast the show Lance Loud!: A Death in an American Family, shot in 2001, visiting the family again at the invitation of Lance before his death. The same family members participated in the documentary, with the exception of Grant. Lance was 50 years old, had gone through 20 years of addiction to crystal meth, and was HIV positive. He died of liver failure caused by a hepatitis C and HIV co-infection that year. The show was billed by PBS as the final episode of An American Family. Subsequent to the showing of A Death in an American Family, Pat and Bill Loud moved back in together, granting one of Lance's last wishes. They lived very close to three of their four surviving children‚ÄîGrant, Michelle and Delilah‚Äîand keep in close contact with Kevin and his family, who live in Arizona. Bill died in July 2018. In April 2011, PBS rebroadcast the entire original series in a marathon format on many of its member stations, before the release of the HBO film Cinema Verite, based on the series.Braxton, Greg, \\"PBS' KOCE to broadcast landmark 'An American Family'\\" , Los Angeles Times, April 13, 2011\\"PBS looking to revisit 1973's 'An American Family'\\" , Associated Press, January 11, 2011 On July 7, 2011, most PBS stations presented An American Family: Anniversary Edition, a two-hour film by Alan and Susan Raymond that featured selected moments from the documentary series, in tribute to the 40 years since the series began filming in 1971.

Loud is best known for his 1973 appearance in An American Family, a pioneer reality television series that featured his coming out, leading to his status as an icon in the gay community. Early life Loud was born in La Jolla, California, in 1951, while his father was in the United States Navy. He spent his early childhood with his parents and four siblings in Eugene, Oregon, and his later childhood and adolescence in Santa Barbara, California. During his teens, Loud discovered Andy Warhol, The Factory, and The Velvet Underground. He later became penpals with Warhol. As a teenager, Loud drove some friends to the Haight-Ashbury to investigate the San Francisco neighborhood's renowned cultural scene. He hitchhiked to Altamont Raceway Park to attend the Altamont Free Concert, later the subject of the documentary Gimme Shelter. An American Family Loud's fame came with An American Family, a documentary of his family's life, which was broadcast in the U.S. on PBS in 1973, drawing 10 million viewers and causing considerable controversy. The show was based in Santa Barbara, California. Loud moved to New York City, driven by his obsession with The Velvet Underground and the Warhol scene. He became a regular at Max's Kansas City and attended Charles Ludlam productions at La Mama, with luminaries such as Jackie Curtis (who later became a close Loud family friend) and Holly Woodlawn. Shortly after the series ended, Loud appeared on The Dick Cavett Show, performing with a working version of what would later become the band \\"The Mumps\\" (which at that point included his siblings Delilah, Michelle and Kevin in the line-up), under the name \\"Loud\\". He stated at the time that he thought the filmmakers had intentionally edited the series to make him seem obnoxious and grating. Loud became a gay icon by having his homosexuality revealed to a national audience during the course of the documentary. His sexual orientation became a topic of national controversy and media scrutiny after several appearances on Dick Cavett and other talk shows, but the positive and grateful feedback from the gay community led Loud to embrace this role with passion and flamboyant, often self-deprecating wit. The Mumps Loud regrouped his band, called The Mumps, along with Santa Barbara High School friend Kristian Hoffman (also featured in An American Family), Rob Duprey (later of the Iggy Pop Band), high school alumnus Jay Dee Daugherty (later of the Patti Smith Group and The Church), and Aaron Kiley. Daugherty and Kiley were soon replaced in what would become The Mumps' long term line up: Lance Loud, Kristian Hoffman, Rob Duprey, Kevin Kiely, and Paul Rutner. The Mumps were a popular band on the Max's Kansas City and CBGB circuit, as well as at other American clubs, for almost five years. They played on bills with rock and punk rock bands such as Television, Talking Heads, the Ramones, Blondie, Milk 'N' Cookies, The Cramps, Cheap Trick, and Van Halen. Despite this popularity and two critically acclaimed, independent 45s, they failed to secure a contract with a major record label. Two compilations of their music have been released: \\"Fatal Charm\\" (Eggbert Records, 1994) and a lavishly illustrated, remastered, 2-disc CD/DVD compilation, \\"How I Saved The World\\", in 2005.[], Biography of The Mumps, Allmusic The CD booklets contain affectionate tributes from members of the Cramps, Sparks, R.E.M., the New York Dolls, Blondie, Dramarama, the Go-Go's, Danzig, Devo, Patti Smith Group, and the Screamers, as well as praise from Danny Fields, Jayne County, Rufus Wainwright, and Paul Reubens, helping to secure The Mumps a place in musical history. Loud wrote a monthly column in the influential Rock Scene magazine, where he reported on his favorite artists and covered unlikely junkets, such as a brief tour with Jim Dandy Mangrum from Black Oak Arkansas. Rock Scene was an early supporter of glam and the punk scene. Journalism When Loud retired from music, he became a noted columnist for several magazines, including The Advocate, Details, Interview, and Creem. Through journalism and sheer force of personality, Loud remained active in many cultural scenes throughout most of his adult life, giving occasional lectures on the impact of An American Family on American society at colleges around the country. He was present at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh when his teenage letters to Andy were officially entered into the Andy Warhol archive. The Loud family was kept in the public eye through two televised PBS updates, both filmed by the original Academy Award-winning team of Alan and Susan Raymond. The last, called Lance Loud! A Death in An American Family, was a poignant depiction of Loud's physical decline, from a 20-year addiction to crystal meth and complications from HIV. It was shown on PBS in January 2003. Subsequent to the showing of A Death in An American Family, Pat and Bill Loud moved back in together, granting one of their oldest son's last wishes. They lived very close to three of their four surviving children in California, with the exception of Kevin, who lives out-of-state with his family. Death In 2001, Loud entered the Carl Bean hospice in Los Angeles, California, suffering from HIV and hepatitis C. Realizing he was dying, Loud called the Raymonds back to film again, expressing dissatisfaction with the way An American Family ended and how the family members were portrayed in it. His wish was that the Louds be portrayed as the family Loud knew them to be. While in hospice care, he wrote his final article, \\"Musings on Mortality\\". On December 22, 2001, Lance Loud died of liver failure as a result of hepatitis C and a co-infection with HIV. He was 50 years old. Portions of Loud's memorial gathering in the garden of Hollywood's Chateau Marmont are included in the documentary, A Death in An American Family, including tributes by his many friends. A rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" was sung by Loud's friend, Rufus Wainwright, while accompanied on piano by Wainwright's mother Kate McGarrigle. Legacy In 2010, HBO Films announced that it was making Cinema Verite, a film about the making of An American Family. Thomas Dekker was cast to play Loud. The film had its debut showing on HBO on April 23, 2011.HBO Announces Premiere Date For Cinema Verite TV Guide, March 17, 2011 In 2012, Lance's mother authored a book about his life called \\"Lance Out Loud\\"; it was edited by Christopher Makos, a longtime friend of Lance, and published by Glitterati Incorporated. Quotes * In his last few days, on having injected crystal meth for 20 years: \\"I was a bit of a prick.\\" * In his final appearance on camera in the 2003 documentary Lance Loud: A Death in An American Family, as mother Pat holds him in her arms, he states, \\"When Louds love, they love long and deep: about six feet deep.\\" * Narrating over footage of himself at the Chelsea in Episode 2 of An American Family: \\"Living in New York, I've become more and more aware that there are other things. If someone gave me a ticket it would just be another excuse and it would be so easy to just go back there and go up to Isla Vista Beach and just sit there all summer long, see my old friends and all my old enemies. Seeing enemies is much more interesting than seeing friends ... and I have so many enemies in Santa Barbara. Always, always interesting. But I think that ... you know, New York has so many things that really do interest me or that could interest me that for ... for my own good, I think I'll just have to stay. Even if I really don't want to. In fact I guess I really don't. It is so much easier just to go home. I could get a little job and make everyone happy on a day to day type basis and get a little money and live by myself in my own apartment or something ... but I don't think that's what I really want to do. I've always felt that, to be dedicated to life, you have to be really passionate, and so I never really think anything is just ok, I either love something or I just hate it forever, to death.\\" * \\"Television ate my family.\\" Discography  * Mumps: How I Saved the World (Sympathy for the Music Industry, 2005), an anthology of recordings, with a DVD of live performances.

He served two terms as a deputy for the Dublin South-East constituency. He served variously as a member of Dublin City Council, D√°il √âireann and Seanad √âireann, becoming Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1998 to 1999. Political career Doyle, a former sacristan in the local Roman Catholic church in Donnybrook, was first elected to public office at the 1979 local elections, to represent the Pembroke area for Fine Gael on Dublin City Council. He served continually in City Hall from 1979 until his retirement at the 2004 local elections. Between 1998 and 1999 he served as Lord Mayor of Dublin. He was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fine Gael Teachta D√°la (TD) for Dublin South-East at the November 1982 general election, where his party constituency colleague was party leader (and after the election Taoiseach) Garret FitzGerald. Broke party ranks on abortion Doyle achieved early party notoriety in 1983, when he was one of eight Fine Gael TDs to defy the party and vote against the Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party coalition's proposed wording to the a nti-abortion constitutional amendment. Whereas the government's wording included a negative prohibition, namely that nothing in the constitution should be interpreted as granting a right to abortion, Doyle‚Äîalong with Alice Glenn and some other colleagues‚Äîendorsed the Fianna F√°il alternative wording that granted a \\"right to life to the unborn, with due regard to the equal right of the mother\\". Because of the controversial nature of the issue of abortion, and the fact that Fine Gael was split on it, he was not sacked from the party for breaking the party whip. Winning and losing seats He was one of a number of TDs to lose their seats at the 1987 general election. At the Senate election that followed, he was elected by the Administrative Panel to sit in the upper house (Seanad √âireann). He regained his D√°il seat at the 1989 general election, where he and FitzGerald achieved two seats out of four with a tight vote- management strategy. However, he lost his seat again at the 1992 general election to new running mate Frances Fitzgerald. Though he contested the 1997 general election‚Äîunder party pressure because it saw Doyle as the party's best chance to win a seat, even though he had originally decided not to contest any more general elections‚Äîhe failed to regain a D√°il seat. He had the consolation of retaining his Senate seat in the election to the 21st Seanad. Lord Mayor of Dublin Doyle served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1998 to 1999. He was central to the decision to erect the Spire of Dublin, on the site of Nelson's Pillar. On his retirement from Dublin City Council in 2004, his political rival, Labour Party Dublin City Councillor Dermot Lacey, paid the following tribute. :I have long respected his integrity and commitment to achieving what he believed was best for the people he represented. In many ways Joe as a politician is the epitome of the historic mandate of Fine Gael - honourable, conservative, compassionate and committed to the democratic institutions of our State. Epilepsy Doyle openly discussed in public life his lifelong experience of battling with epilepsy, a consequence of which was he could not drive, normally a necessity for a local representative elected from a constituency. Best man at Brendan Behan's wedding He also revealed that as sacristan in the local church he had been best man at the wedding of Irish playwright and author Brendan Behan, when Behan found himself without a best man at the ceremony. Personal life and family Joe Doyle married Margaret Mary Maguire on 11 February 1969 in the Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, Dublin. They had two sons and one daughter.

The Civilization brand is now owned by Hasbro. It was out of print for many years, before Gibsons Games republished it in 2018. The game typically takes eight or more hours to play and is for two to seven players. Civilization is considered to be the first game ever to incorporate a technology tree (or \\"tech tree\\"), a common feature in subsequent board and video games, allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. Overview The Civilization board depicts areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The board is divided into many regions. Each player plays a historic civilization and starts in the area where appropriate for that civilization, and attempts to grow and expand their empire over successive turns, trying to build the greatest civilization while minimizing the effects of calamities and war. The goal of Civilization is to be first to advance to the final space on a table called the Archaeological Succession Table (AST). The AST starts at 8,000 B.C. and ends at 250 B.C. The AST contains fifteen spaces, and players are advanced on the AST each turn. At several points, however, certain conditions must be met (such as, the civilization must have a certain number of cities) in order to advance. Since any given civilization is unlikely to meet the advancement criteria at every stage of the AST, games usually last more than fifteen turns. Civilization is unusual in that it does not focus on war and combat, as many games of its genre do. Instead, players are encouraged to trade and cooperate in order to advance. However, war and combat are entirely permissible, and are sometimes inevitable. In fact, the game is designed to limit players' geographical expansion possibilities, forcing them to deal with other civilizations militarily, diplomatically, or otherwise if they wish their own civilization to reach its full potential. Gameplay A game starts with each player having a single population token in the area based on the specific civilization represented (e.g. on the island of Crete for the Cretans or in Africa for the Egyptians). As the first few turns progress, the population expands exponentially. Since any given area only supports so many population tokens, players need to spread out, eventually meeting the civilizations of other players. As each civilization grows, adding more and more population to the board, players can convert excess population into cities by gathering six population tokens in an area favoring settlement (or twelve in other areas). Each city grants a trade card to the owner, one of eleven commodities, such as iron, salt and grain. Having more cities gives access to more valuable commodities, such as bronze, spice and gold. Collecting more cards in a set gives an exponentially larger payout. For example, one salt is worth 3 points, two are worth 12 points, and three are worth 27 points. Thus, players are encouraged to trade with each other to collect sets of the same commodity. Along with trade come eight calamities such as volcanoes, famine and civil war, which destroy population and cities. Gains from trade are in turn used to purchase civilization cards, such as agriculture, coinage, philosophy and medicine, which grant special abilities and give bonuses toward future civilization card purchases. Trade is the most important activity in Civilization. Trade cards give a player's civilization wealth, which ultimately helps their civilization advance on the AST. Many \\"trade sessions\\" can become quite vocal and exuberant as players try to out-trade one another. Since players are only required to tell the truth about one of the cards and the total points value they are trading, calamity cards can be slipped into a trade, thereby avoiding receiving the effects of the calamity. The goal of the game is to advance (on the AST) through the Late Iron Age and become the most advanced civilization on the map board. This is accomplished through clever game play and purchase of several high-value civilization cards. Editions Civilization by Hartland Trefoil (1980).

Adds additional commodities such as timber, silver and ivory to reduce the frequency of calamities, reduce the risk for a shortage in low value trade cards (which disproportionately hurts the players with the most cities), and increase the challenge of making large sets.General Magazine, Vol 19, No 4, p. 9 Advanced Civilization includes this expansion. * Western Extension Map (1988): Usable with the Hartland/Trefoil and the Avalon Hill version. Extends the game board west of Italy to cover Gaul, parts of the Iberian peninsula, the British Isles and northwest Africa. (Note that a version of this expansion was also available for the original Hartland Trefoil version of the game) * Eastern Expansion Map (1995): Usable with the Hartland/Trefoil and the Avalon Hill version. Adds Persia, Sumer, Samita and Indus people and covers the areas of Persia, the westernmost parts of the Indian subcontinent and Arabia. The map has the imprint \\"Civilisation Eastern Extension Unofficial Version\\". It was published in Alea Magazine #21 (Spain). In addition there are five new civilization cards. Computer versions Incunabula was the first computer emulation of the board game by Avalon Hill (1984, for MS-DOS). Besides the main game, it included two shorter variants, one eliminating trade and one that includes only trade. Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization was a 1995 MS-DOS computer version of the board game, incorporating the Advanced Civilization expansion. The rules were slightly modified from the board game for computer play. Similar games A projected sequel of the Civilization board game in the ages after antiquity drove the development of Age of Renaissance, published by Avalon Hill in 1996. This game, designed for 3 to 6 players, has kept only a few features of 'Civilization, such as commodities (no longer collectible cards but territories) and the civilization advances (no longer cards but ticks in a check list). Reception In the February 1983 edition of Dragon magazine (Issue #70), Tony Watson thought the game was ground-breaking, saying, \\"Once in a while, a new game comes out that proves that there is still plenty of virgin territory out there for game designers to explore and plenty of room for innovative and imaginative approaches to those subjects. Avalon Hill's release, Civilization, is just such a game.\\" After a length assessment of the game, he concluded, \\"Civilization is a game that defies comparison with others [...] It's a fine value and is highly recommended.\\" In the January 1990 edition of Games International (Issue 12), Steve Jones examined the game at length and concluded, \\"Civilization is an excellent multi-player game for those who like long games which require considerable thought, concentration and decision making.\\" Civilization was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Steven Savile commented that designer Francis Tresham \\"created a thinking gamer's game, one that deserves to be played around a table with friends ‚Äî especially the cheerfully scheming sort\\". Awards At the 1983 Origins Awards, Civilization was awarded the Charles S. Roberts Award for \\"Best Pre-20th Century Boardgame of 1982\\". Legacy The game shares the name and the basic broad themes of expansion, development and conflict with the computer game Civilization by Sid Meier. The computer game is otherwise unrelated to Civilization. Although the success of the Civilization computer games series has led to multiple board games, starting with Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame in 2002, none of these games has any direct relation to the Civilization board game discussed here.

It results in inflammation of the meninges (the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, sensitivity to light and neck stiffness. Viruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses). However, other viruses can also cause viral meningitis, such as West Nile virus, mumps, measles, herpes simplex types I and II, varicella and lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Based on clinical symptoms, viral meningitis cannot be reliably differentiated from bacterial meningitis, although viral meningitis typically follows a more benign clinical course. Viral meningitis has no evidence of bacteria present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is often needed to identify the disease. In most cases, there is no specific treatment, with efforts generally aimed at relieving symptoms (headache, fever or nausea). A few viral causes, such as HSV, have specific treatments. In the United States, viral meningitis is the cause of more than half of all cases of meningitis. With the prevalence of bacterial meningitis in decline, the viral disease is garnering more and more attention. The estimated incidence has a considerable range, from 0.26 to 17 cases per 100,000 people. For enteroviral meningitis, the most common cause of viral meningitis, there are up to 75,000 cases annually in the United States alone. While the disease can occur in both children and adults, it is more common in children. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of Meningitis Viral meningitis characteristically presents with fever, headache and neck stiffness. Fever is the result of cytokines released that affect the thermoregulatory (temperature control) neurons of the hypothalamus. Cytokines and increased intracranial pressure stimulate nociceptors in the brain that lead to headaches. Neck stiffness is the result of inflamed meninges stretching due to flexion of the spine. The various layers of meninges act form a separation between the brain and the skull. In contrast to bacterial meningitis, symptoms associated with viral meningitis are often less severe and do not progress as quickly. Nausea, vomiting and photophobia (light sensitivity) also commonly occur, as do general signs of a viral infection, such as muscle aches and malaise. Increased cranial pressure from viral meningitis stimulates the area postrema, which causes nausea and vomiting. Widened pulse pressure (systolic - diastolic blood pressure), bradycardia, and irregular respiration would be alarming for Cushing's reflex, a sign of acutely elevated intracranial pressure. Photophobia is due to meningeal irritation. In severe cases, people may experience concomitant encephalitis (meningoencephalitis), which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures or focal neurologic deficits. Babies with viral meningitis may only appear irritable, sleepy or have trouble eating. Infection in the neonatal period may be the result of infection during pregnancy. In severe cases, people may experience concomitant encephalitis (meningoencephalitis), which is suggested by symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures or focal neurologic deficits. The pediatric population may show some additional signs and symptoms that include jaundice and bulging fontanelles. A biphasic fever is more often seen in children compared to adults. The first fever arrives with the onset of general constitutional symptoms, and the second accompanying the onset of the neurological symptoms. Symptoms can vary depending on the virus responsible for infection. Enteroviral meningitis (the most common cause) typically presents with the classic headache, photophobia, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. With coxsackie and echo virus' specifically, a maculopapular rash may be present, or even the typical vesicles seen with Herpangina. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can be differentiated from the common presenting meningeal symptoms by the appearance of a prodromal influenza-like sickness about 10 days before other symptoms begin. Mumps meningitis can present similarly to isolated mumps, with possible parotid and testicular swelling. Interestingly, research has shown that HSV-2 meningitis most often occurs in people with no history of genital herpes, and that a severe frontal headache is among the most common presenting symptoms. Patients with varicella zoster meningitis may present with herpes zoster (Shingles) in conjunction with classic meningeal signs. Meningitis can be an indication that an individual with HIV is undergoing seroconversion, the time when the human body is forming antibodies in response to the virus.  Causes  The most common causes of viral meningitis in the United States are non-polio enteroviruses. The viruses that cause meningitis are typically acquired from sick contacts. However, in most cases, people infected with viruses that may cause meningitis do not actually develop meningitis. Viruses that can cause meningitis include: Mechanism Meningitis Viral Meningitis is mostly caused by an infectious agent that has colonized somewhere in its host. People who are already in an immunocompromised state are at the highest risk of pathogen entry. Some of the most common examples of immunocompromised individuals include those with HIV, cancer, diabetes, malnutrition, certain genetic disorders, and patients on chemotherapy. Potential sites for this include the skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, nasopharynx, and genitourinary tract. The organism invades the submucosa at these sites by invading host defenses, such as local immunity, physical barriers, and phagocytes or macrophages. After pathogen invasion, the immune system is activated. An infectious agent can enter the central nervous system and cause meningeal disease via invading the bloodstream, a retrograde neuronal pathway, or by direct contiguous spread. Immune cells and damaged endothelial cells release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cytokines, and nitric oxide. MMPs and NO induce vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. Cytokines induce capillary wall changes in the blood brain barrier, which leads to expression of more leukocyte receptors, thus increasing white blood cell binding and extravasation. The barrier that the meninges create between the brain and the bloodstream are what normally protect the brain from the body's immune system. Damage to the meninges and endothelial cells increases cytotoxic reactive oxygen species production, which damages pathogens as well as nearby cells. In meningitis, the barrier is disrupted, so once viruses have entered the brain, they are isolated from the immune system and can spread. This leads to elevated intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, meningeal irritation, and neuronal death. Diagnosis Lumbar Puncture The diagnosis of viral meningitis is made by clinical history, physical exam, and several diagnostic tests. Kernig and Brudzinski signs may be elucidated with specific physical exam maneuvers, and can help diagnose meningitis at the bedside. Most importantly however, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected via lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap). This fluid, which normally surrounds the brain and spinal cord, is then analyzed for signs of infection. CSF findings that suggest a viral cause of meningitis include an elevated white blood cell count (usually 10-100 cells/¬µL) with a lymphocytic predominance in combination with a normal glucose level. Increasingly, cerebrospinal fluid PCR tests have become especially useful for diagnosing viral meningitis, with an estimated sensitivity of 95-100%. Additionally, samples from the stool, urine, blood and throat can also help to identify viral meningitis. CSF vs serum c-reactive protein and procalcitonin have not been shown to elucidate whether meningitis is bacterial or viral. In certain cases, a CT scan of the head should be done before a lumbar puncture such as in those with poor immune function or those with increased intracranial pressure. If the patient has focal neurological deficits, papilledema, a Glasgow Coma Score less than 12, or a recent history of seizures, lumbar puncture should be reconsidered. Differential diagnosis for viral meningitis includes meningitis caused by bacteria, mycoplasma, fungus, and drugs such as NSAIDS, TMP-SMX, IVIG. Further considerations include brain tumors, lupus, vasculitis, and Kawasaki disease in the pediatric population. Treatment Aciclovir Because there is no clinical differentiation between bacterial and viral meningitis, people with suspected disease should be sent to the hospital for further evaluation. Treatment for viral meningitis is generally supportive. Rest, hydration, antipyretics, and pain or anti-inflammatory medications may be given as needed. However, if there is initial uncertainty as to whether the meningitis is bacterial or viral in origin, empiric antibiotics are often given until bacterial infection is ruled out. Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus have a specific antiviral therapy. For herpes the treatment of choice is aciclovir. If encephalitis is suspected, empiric treatment with IV aciclovir is often warranted. Surgical management is indicated where there is extremely increased intracranial pressure, infection of an adjacent bony structure (e.g. mastoiditis), skull fracture, or abscess formation. The majority of people that have viral meningitis get better within 7‚Äì10 days. Epidemiology From 1988‚Äì1999, about 36,000 cases occurred each year. As recently as 2017, the incidence in the U.S. alone increased to 75,000 cases per year for enteroviral meningitis. With the advent and implementation of vaccinations for organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza type B, and Neisseria meningitis, rates of bacterial meningitis have been in decline, making viral meningitis more common. Countries without high rates of immunization still carry higher rates of bacterial disease. While the disease can occur in both children and adults, it is more common in children. Rates of infection tend to reach a peak in the summer and fall. During an outbreak in Romania and in Spain viral meningitis was more common among adults. While, people aged younger than 15 made up 33.8% of cases. In contrast in Finland in 1966 and in Cyprus in 1996, Gaza 1997, China 1998 and Taiwan 1998, the incidences of viral meningitis were more common among children. Recent research It has been proposed that viral meningitis might lead to inflammatory injury of the vertebral artery wall. The Meningitis Research Foundation is conducting a study to see if new genomic techniques can improve the speed, accuracy and cost of diagnosing meningitis in children in the UK. The research team will develop a new method to be used for the diagnosis of meningitis, analysing the genetic material of microorganisms found in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). The new method will first be developed using CSF samples where the microorganism is known, but then will be applied to CSF samples where the microorganism is unknown (estimated at around 40%) to try and identify a cause. There is also research investigating whether high-throughput sequencing, wherein the investigator does not need to compare DNA results with known genomic sequences, could be used in specifically diagnosing unknown causes of viral meningitis. While there is some emerging evidence that bacterial meningitis may have a negative impact on cognitive function, there is no such evidence for viral meningitis.

It uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional Akan music, but is played with Western instruments. Highlife is characterised by jazzy horns and multiple guitars which lead the band. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound. Highlife gained popularity among the Igbo people of Nigeria following World War II, becoming the country's most popular music genre in 1960. History The following arpeggiated highlife guitar part is modeled after an Afro-Cuban guajeo.Eyre, Banning (2006: 9). \\"Highlife guitar example\\" Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music. Alfred Pub. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3-2 clave motif guajeo as shown below. The bell pattern known in Cuba as clave is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in highlife.Pe√±alosa, David (2010: 247). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. . Top: clave. Bottom: highlife guitar part (). In the 1920s, Ghanaian musicians incorporated foreign influences like the foxtrot and calypso with Ghanaian rhythms like osibisaba (Fante). Highlife was associated with the local African aristocracy during the colonial period, and was played by numerous bands including the Jazz Kings, Cape Coast Sugar Babies, and Accra Orchestra along the country's coast. The high class audience members who enjoyed the music in select clubs gave the music its name. The dance orchestra leader Yebuah Mensah (E.T. Mensah‚Äôs older brother) told John Collins in 1973 that the term 'highlife' appeared in the early 1920s \\"as a catch-phrase for the orchestrated indigenous songs played at [exclusive] clubs by such early dance bands as the Jazz Kings, the Cape Coast Sugar Babies, the Sekondi Nanshamang and later the Accra Orchestra. The people outside called it the highlife as they did not reach the class of the couples going inside, who not only had to pay a relatively high entrance fee of about 7s 6d (seven shillings and sixpence), but also had to wear full evening dress, including top-hats if they could afford it.\\" From the 1930s, Highlife spread via Ghanaian workers to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Gambia among other West African countries, where the music quickly gained popularity. An invitation to a concert featuring Louis Armstrong \\"from America\\" and E. T. Mensah and his Tempos Band \\"of West African Fame\\" In the 1940s, the music diverged into two distinct streams: dance band highlife and guitar band highlife. Guitar band highlife featured smaller bands and, at least initially, was most common in rural areas. Because of the history of stringed instruments like the seprewa in the region, musicians were happy to incorporate the guitar. They also used the dagomba style, borrowed from Kru sailors from Liberia, to create highlife's two-finger picking style. Guitar band highlife also featured singing, drums and claves. E.K. Nyame and his Akan Trio helped to popularize guitar band highlife, and would release over 400 records during Nyame's lifetime. Dance band highlife, by contrast, was more rooted in urban settings. In the post-war period, larger dance orchestras began to be replaced by smaller professional dance bands, typified by the success of E.T. Mensah and the Tempos. As foreign troops departed, the primary audiences became increasingly Ghanaian, and the music changed to cater to their tastes. Mensah's fame soared after he played with Louis Armstrong in Accra in May 1956, and he eventually earned the nickname, the \\"King of Highlife\\". Also important from the 1950s onward was musician King Bruce, who served as band leader to the Black Beats. Some other early bands were, the Red Spots, the Rhythm Aces, the Ramblers and Broadway- Uhuru.

The result is comparable in sound to ragtime or stride piano styles. Blues researcher Peter B. Lowry coined the term, giving co-credit to fellow folklorist Bruce Bastin. The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles, particularly the Mississippi Delta blues, by its ragtime-based rhythms. Origins \\"In the convict camp in Greene County, Georgia\\", 1941. Buddy Moss is playing guitar; other men unidentified. The basis of the Piedmont style began with the older \\"frailing\\" or \\"framming\\" guitar styles that may have been universal throughout the South, and was also based, at least to some extent, on formal \\"parlor guitar\\" techniques as well as earlier banjo playing, string band, and ragtime. What was particular to the Piedmont was that a generation of players adapted these older, ragtime-based techniques to blues in a singular and popular fashion, influenced by guitarists such as Blind Blake and Gary Davis. Geography The Piedmont blues was named after the Piedmont plateau region, on the East Coast of the United States from about Richmond, Virginia to Atlanta, Georgia. Piedmont blues musicians come from this area, as well as Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and northern Florida, western South Carolina, central North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama ‚Äì later the Northeastern cities such as Boston, Newark, New Jersey, and New York. Recordings Recording artists such as Blind Blake, Josh White, Buddy Moss, and Blind Boy Fuller helped spread the style on the strength of their sales throughout the region. It was nationally popular with the African-American audience for about twenty years from the mid-1920s through to the mid-1940s. Blind Boy Fuller's 1940 recording of \\"Step It Up and Go\\" sold over half a million copies. Post-World War II As a form of Black American popular music, Piedmont blues fell out of favor on a national basis after World War II. By the late-1950s, it was being performed at US folk music revivals and festivals initially by established Piedmont blues artists such as Josh White, Rev. Gary Davis, and Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, as well as Cephas & Wiggins, John Jackson in later years. While musicologists such as George Mitchell, Peter B. Lowry and Tim Duffy collected recordings by the aging community of Piedmont blues players, younger musicians such as Stefan Grossman, Roy Book Binder, Jorma Kaukonen, Paul Geremia, Keb Mo', Michael Roach, Samuel James, Eric Bibb, Ry Cooder, David Bromberg, and Guy Davis have carried on the Piedmont tradition, often having \\"studied\\" under some of the old Piedmont masters. The Piedmont fingerpicking style of guitar playing has also influenced other folk and popular musicians such as Doc Watson and Ralph McTell.Grossman, Stefan. \\"Ralph McTell ‚Äì European Fingerpicker\\", Guitar Player, August 1976 Arlo Guthrie famously used a Piedmont blues backing for his \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" monologues, as it was easy to play repeatedly for long stretches of time.Doyle, Patrick (November 26, 2014).

It was released in North America by Taito America by UA Ltd. in 1982 for the Emerson Arcadia 2001 and other video game consoles. It is one of the most acclaimed games in Nichibutsu's library. A precursor to the platform game genre, Crazy Climber was the first climbing-themed video game‚Äîspecifically, climbing buildings‚Äîbefore Nintendo's 1981 release Donkey Kong. The game was ported to the Atari 2600, Arcadia 2001, Famicom, and Sharp X68000. Description Famicom screenshot The player assumes the role of a climber attempting to reach the top of four skyscrapers. The climber is controlled via two joysticks. =Obstacles= *Windows that open and close *Residents who throw objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building. *A condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber. *A giant ape whose punch can prove deadly. *Falling steel girders and iron dumbbells. *Live wires which protrude off electric Nichibutsu signs. *Falling Crazy Climber signs. Some of these dangers appear at every level of the game; others make appearances only in later stages. Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated. One ally the climber has is a pink \\"Lucky Balloon\\"; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon. If the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter only waits about 30 seconds before flying off. If the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score. The difficulty level of any game was modified to take into account the skill of previous players. Hence if a player pushed the high score up to 250,000 any novice player following would get thoroughly wiped out for several games, due to the increased difficulty level, and have to play until it dropped back down. Musical cues used throughout the game include \\"Baby Elephant Walk\\", \\"The Pink Panther Theme\\", and \\"The Entertainer\\". If the climber is not moved for several seconds, a voice says \\"Go for it!\\" The Family Computer version had a special controller that could be used with it. Legacy * In 1981, Bandai Electronics manufactured a hand-held VFD version of the game. * A Japanese-only sequel, Crazy Climber 2, was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to Crazy Climber in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features. * On February 3, 1996, Hyper Crazy Climber was released only in Japan for the PlayStation. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartooney characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a Bomberman- style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used. * On March 2, 2000, Crazy Climber 2000 was released for the PlayStation. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade Crazy Climber and a scan of the instruction panel. Like Hyper Crazy Climber which released for the same console 4 years earlier, Crazy Climber 2000 was released only in Japan. * On July 21, 2005, Japanese publisher HAMSTER released the arcade version of Crazy Climber under their Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono („Ç™„É¨„Åü„Å°„Ç≤„Éº„Çª„É≥Êóè) classic game line for the PlayStation 2. * Crazy Climber Wii was released for the Wii in Japan on December 20, 2007.IGN: Crazy Climber * The arcade game was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on February 23, 2010. * On February 8, 2018, the game was released for the Nintendo Switch by HAMSTER under their Arcade Archives series.

The Telegraph is published Monday through Saturday and is available throughout Sydney, across most of regional and remote New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South East Queensland. Amongst those ranked by Nielsen, the Telegraph's website is the sixth most popular Australian news website with a unique monthly audience of 2,841,381 readers. History Founded in 1879, The Daily Telegraph ran as a broadsheet until 1927, when it switched to a tabloid format. The paper returned to a broadsheet format in 1931, but paper restrictions during the Second World War saw it return to tabloid format in 1942. From 1936 until its sale to Rupert Murdoch's News Limited in 1972, the Telegraph was owned by Sir Frank Packer's Australian Consolidated Press. In February 1957, Prime Minister Robert Menzies barred Telegraph correspondents from his press conferences because the paper had been critical of his policies. In October 1990, at the same time as a merger took place between its Melbourne sister papers The Sun News-Pictorial and The Herald, the Telegraph merged with its afternoon sister paper The Daily Mirror to form The Daily Telegraph-Mirror with morning and afternoon editions. The new paper continued in this vein until January 1996, when its name reverted to The Daily Telegraph. The paper continued morning and afternoon editions until January 2002, when the afternoon edition was discontinued. The circulation of the Telegraph during the June quarter 2013 was 310,724 on weekdays, the largest of a Sydney newspaper. In the 2013-14 financial year it decreased 9.65% to 280,731.Mediaweek August/Enhanced Media Metrics Australia (emma) In the financial year ending June 2019, the Mon-Fri readership of the Daily Telegraph declined 10.9%. The Saturday readership declined by 19.3%.  Breaches of media ethics in coverage of LGBTI people  = Transgender Student and the word 'Faggot' = On 2 May 2019, the Daily Telegraph published an article about a US case of a teacher who refused to use the appropriate pronouns for a transgender student. The article prominently incorporated a video with the word 'faggot' appearing twice, once in capitalised letters. The thumbnail for the video also prominently incorporated the word 'faggot'. On 17 September 2019, following an investigation spanning 16 months, the Australian Press Council found in Adjudication #1785 that \\"the word 'faggot' is most used as a prejorative term to describe gay men. The Council also found that the inclusion of the word could reasonably be read as \\"demeaning and mocking of gay men... and others with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics\\". = Reporting on transgender woman accused of violence found to be prejudicial = In January 2017, the Daily Telegraph published an article concerning a transgender woman subsequently convicted of a violent axe attack in a Sydney suburb. Although her transgender status was irrelevant to the incident at the time, The Daily Telegraph used derogatory slurs and made repeated references to the attacker's history of sex reassignment surgery, calling the woman a \\"tranny\\" who \\"had chopped herself\\". The following week, SBS published an article expressing concern about how journalists \\"appear to enjoy treating transgender people as the punchline to a joke,\\" singling out the Daily Telegraph's journalist. In September 2018, the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal considered whether the article constituted unlawful vilification through its \\"gratuitous references to\\", and \\"ridicule of\\" the woman's transgender status. The Tribunal found that the Daily Telegraph published the article with \\"apparent disregard for the injurious effect it might have on transgender people.\\" The Tribunal also held that, \\"it is evident that [the journalist] was seeking to make fun of Ms Amati and probably transgender people more generally,\\" and that the \\"attempt at humour was in poor taste and completely devoid of empathy or sensitivity.\\" Continuing, the Tribunal also held that the article \\"contributes to the perpetration and perpetuation of demeaning negative stereotypes and a lack of acceptance of transgender people within the community.\\" The Tribunal ultimately concluded that, whilst \\"close to the line\\", the article did not reach the threshold for vilification. Lawyer Michael Bradley wrote an analysis of the case for political news website Crikey, arguing that the publication of such articles should not be unlawful, but instead that the Daily Telegraph should have sufficient social responsibility to cease publishing the author's \\"recklessly hurtful attempts at wit ‚Äî because he did, and does, harm.\\" As of September 2018, the article has been removed from the website of the Daily Telegraph and replaced with a notice stating \\"This article is no longer available.\\" On 18 October 2019, after an investigation spanning 1,011 days, the Australian Press Council concluded that the article breached its Statement of General Principles. = Infographic stating youth homosexuality was a sickness found to be prejudicial = On 12 July 2017, the Daily Telegraph published an article headlined \\"Fat Chance Of Being Healthy\\" in print. The article was syndicated online under the headline \\"Junk food, alcohol and drugs are fuelling health crisis in young adults\\". The article contained an infographic that canvassed social health concerns, such as alcohol usage, obesity, and drug dependency, for which \\"Young Aussies have only themselves to blame\\". The infographic included \\"same sex attraction\\" among the condemnable health problems it canvassed. A number of LGBTI Australians complained that the article was prejudicial, saying that sexual orientation is neither a choice nor a medical problem, and such coverage contributes to prejudice, shame and suicide risk for young same-sex attracted people. The 'blameworthiness' implicit in the headline was alleged to perpetuate negative stereotypes about gay children. The article drew condemnation from the ABC's Media Watch, Sydney radio station 2 DAY FM, Pedestrian TV, and Junkee. Chris Dore, the publication's Chief Editor, responded to the criticism from the Daily Telegraph's social media accounts, saying the story had been \\"misinterpreted\\" and that it \\"in no way suggests, or intends to suggest, that same-sex relationships are unhealthy. There is no judgement expressed at all in the story other than diet.\\" The press regulator, the Australian Press Council was asked to consider whether the article complied with its Statement of General Principles. The Council concluded its investigations five months later. It upheld the complaint, saying \\"the reference to ill health and blame in the headlines, with the statistic about same-sex attraction displayed among factors such as obesity and drug use, suggested same-sex attraction is unhealthy and blameworthy. As a result, the article caused substantial offence, distress, prejudice and risk to public health and safety, and there was no public interest justifying this.\\" The Daily Telegraph was further sanctioned by the Australian Press Council for failing to comply with the requirements around publication of adjudication findings. The Press Council required the publisher to republish the print component of the adjudication as it was not fully compliant with its requirements in the first instance. The reprint was published on 24 January 2018. The Daily Telegraph claimed that \\"nothing sinister had occurred [in the non-compliance]\\", and blamed the misdemeanour on a production error. = Reporting about Australian Defence Force LGBTI Inclusion Guide found to be misleading = The Australian press regulator, the Australian Press Council, concluded on 13 May 2019 that an article published by the Daily Telegraph about an Australian Defence Force 'LGBTI Diversity and Inclusion Guide' breached its General Principles because the report was inaccurate and misleading. The report's headline was found to have misled readers into believing that the Australian Defence Force had banned service members from using the terms \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" out of concern for the sensitivities of gender diverse service members. = Interview discussing transgender children that was found to be misleading = On 12 June 2019, the Australian Press Council concluded a 14 month investigation into an article and associated podcast published by the Daily Telegraph about transgender children. It concluded that the article breached its General Principles because factual claims about medical efficacy were likely to be misleading. The impugned material concerned an interview in April 2018 between columnist Miranda Devine and Ryan T. Anderson of the conservative American think-tank, the Heritage Foundation. The material substantially focused on medical care for transgender children and adolescents, and claimed that there exists \\"no evidence that these hormones are safe to be used on kids, no evidence of any reduction in self-harm or suicide.\\" At the time, gender affirming treatments were already considered medically necessary and highly effective by a significant number of eminent medical associations, including the American Medical Association,https://policysearch.ama- assn.org/policyfinder/detail/financial%20barriers%20transgender?uri=%2FAMADoc%2FHOD.xml-0-1128.xml the World Health Organisation, the World Medical Association,https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-statement-on-transgender- people/ the American Academy of Pediatricians,https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/142/4/e20182162.full- text.pdf the International Endocrine Society,https://www.endocrine.org/-/media/endosociety/files/advocacy-and- outreach/position- statements/2017/position_statement_transgender_health.pdf?la=en the World Professional Association for Transgender Health,https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/Web%20Transfer/Policies/WPATH- Position-on-Medical-Necessity-12-21-2016.pdf the American Psychological Association,http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx American Psychiatric Association,https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/About- APA/Organization-Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-2018-Discrimination- Against-Transgender-and-Gender-Diverse-Individuals.pdf the American Academy of Family Physicians,http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf, the Australian New Zealand Professional Association for Transgender Health,https://www.anzpath.org/assets/australian-standards-of-care-and- treatment-guidelines-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-children-and-adolescents.pdf The Royal Children's Hospital, the Australian Psychiatric Association, the American Psychiatric Association,https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/About-APA/Organization- Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-2018-Discrimination-Against-Transgender- and-Gender-Diverse-Individuals.pdf and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2015/november/gender-dysphoria/ = Opinion column on transgender children found to be misleading = The Australian Press Council sanctioned a further article by columnist Miranda Devine about Australian transgender children, headlined \\"What Madness can Justify Mutilating our Children?\\" The piece referred to medical procedures for gender transition as \\"mutilation\\", \\"child surgical abuse\\" and a \\"monstrous assault on [adolescent's] developing bodies\\". The article also cited the opinion of a Sydney pediatrician who has never treated gender dysphoria, performed no original research into its cause or treatment, and who has appeared previously in presentations hosted by the Australian Christian Lobby on the subject of medical care for transgender adolescents. The article did not cross-reference those opinions against eminent medical bodies or contemporary standards of practice as recommended in the Press Council's Advisory Guide. The Australian Press Council concluded in June 2019 that the article breached its Standards of Practice. It held that the claim of \\"no evidence that changing sex will reduce the incidence of self-harm or suicide or lessen the impact of other associated mental states\\" was misleading and expressed in such absolute terms to be inaccurate. The ABC's Media Watch criticised the publication for \\"lack of balance\\" and for putting religious and political motivations ahead of truth, balanced facts and the public interest in evidence-based medical care. Other Controversies A 2013 poll conducted by Essential Research found that the Telegraph was Australia's least-trusted major newspaper, with 41% of respondents citing trust in the paper. = Geoffrey Rush Defamation = On 30 November 2017, the Daily Telegraph published a front page article, headlined \\"King Leer\\", alleging that actor Geoffrey Rush had acted inappropriately towards a female actor during rehearsals for the Sydney Theatre Company's 2015-2016 production of \\"King Lear\\". The article featured an image of Rush shirtless and in white makeup. Rush denied the incidents, and said his career had been \\"irreparably damaged\\" by the newspaper's untrue reports. It subsequently came to light that the Daily Telegraph did not interview the female actor concerned and provided only a bare few hours for Rush to respond to the serious allegations. Rush filed proceedings on 8 December 2017 in the Federal Court of Australia for defamation against the publisher of the Daily Telegraph, saying the publisher \\"made false, pejorative and demeaning claims, splattering them with unrelenting bombast on its front pages\\". The defamation claim was upheld on 11 April, on the grounds that the Telegraph failed to prove the truth of its allegations. Rush was awarded $0.85m, with further damages for the actor‚Äôs economic losses to be determined later. He said that the female actor was needlessly \\"dragged into the spotlight by the actions\\" of the Daily Telegraph. Despite the damaging judgement, the Telegraph stood behind the article's journalist, Jonathon Moran. = Tony Zoef Defamation = On 22 August 2013, the Daily Telegraph published an article headlined \\"Tailor‚Äôs alter ego as a gunrunner\\". The article referred to an individual who was known to Sutherland Shire locals as a \\"friendly tailor who spends his days altering their clothes\\". The article claimed that the individual was \\"alleged\\" by police to be \\"the mastermind behind a haul of military-grade weapons smuggled into Australia\\".http://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/asset/5625cf26e4b01392a2cd1e29.pdf The article mistakenly attributed the alleged crimes to the wrong individual, who subsequently filed a complaint of defamation in the New South Wales Discrict Court. In the first instance, the Court found that, despite the serious errors in the article, the publisher's defence based on a prior offer of amends should prevail.http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWDC/2015/232.html On appeal, the Supreme Court of NSW upheld the complaint of defamation. It held that, \\"Taking into account the seriousness of the defamatory imputations and the significant hurt they caused the appellant, the damage to his business as a tailor, the unequal prominence the respondent afforded to the proposed correction and apology and their resultant inadequacy, the modest monetary component of the offer, and the likelihood of the proceedings being successful, the offer of amends was not reasonable.\\" http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/viewdoc/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2016/283.html The Court awarded a sum of $150,000 to the complainant. = John Brogden allegations = The Telegraph was widely criticised for its coverage of former New South Wales Liberal leader John Brogden. After Brogden resigned in 2005, the newspaper ran a front-page headline, \\"Brogden's Sordid Past: Disgraced Liberal leader damned by secret shame file,\\" detailing past allegations of misconduct by Brogden. The following day, Brogden attempted suicide at his electoral office. Rodney Tiffen, an academic at the University of Sydney, described the newspaper's coverage as an example of \\"hyena journalism\\", judging Brogden's personal life to be off limits following his withdrawal from public life. Editor David Penberthy claimed that his source was from inside the Liberal Party and that none of the events would have happened if no one leaked from inside the party.Editor rejects attack over Brogden coverage. 31/08/2005. ABC News Online = Mount Druitt High School = On 8 January 1997, the Telegraph published the headline, \\"The class we failed\\" concerning was the Year 12 class at Mount Druitt High School in outer Western Sydney in which no student scored a Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) above 50 (the maximum possible rank is 99.95). Although the article made clear that the newspaper believed that the state had failed the students, many accused the Telegraph of branding the students themselves as failures and showing a full year photo identifying students. The story led to a renewed focus on the quality of public schools in Western Sydney and precipitated several reviews of schooling in the area. But for many, the headline highlighted problems with interpreting Higher School Certificate results and the accompanying TER.Policy Spring (Sept‚ÄìNov) 1998 The students successfully sued the newspaper in the Supreme Court for defamation. The Telegraph subsequently apologised and settled for damages out of court.NSW Teachers Federation: Education Online: November 2000: Telegraph apologises to Mt Druitt students The published apology stated: Later, criticising defamation laws, News Limited CEO John Hartigan said that = Call centres in India = In October 2006, The Telegraph claimed in a front-page article that ANZ were using call centres in Bangalore, India. The paper even sent a journalist to Bangalore, Luke McIlveen, and a photographer to verify this claim.Media Watch: Front Page ‚Äî Bad Line For Bangalore (16 October 2006) ANZ denied the claim, stating that they do not employ overseas call centre staff in India. Subsequently, ANZ pulled all of its advertising from News Limited, including Foxtel and News website, which amounted to $4 to 5 million, about 10 per cent of ANZ's advertising budget. In assuming blame, David Penberthy, editor-in-chief of News Limited, defended McIlveen.\\"The Age of disbelief\\", The Australian =Allegations of plagiarism= In 2002, former Telegraph journalist, Matt Sun, was accused of plagiarism by the TV program Media Watch. Editor at the time, Campbell Reid, responded by accusing Media Watch's host of having a conflict of interest that \\"destroyed the credibility of any judgement he could pass on the ethics and standards of others in the media\\". =Press Council complaint regarding Greens article= In May 2011, The Telegraph published an article making an assertion about the Australian Greens which subsequently prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council. The article asserted that the Greens had managed to \\"force\\" the Government to divert money from flood relief, to fund various Green programs. The Press Council upheld the complaint and stated that the assertion was inaccurate and remained uncorrected. =Press Council complaint regarding series of misleading NBN articles= In June and July 2011, The Telegraph published a series of articles about the National Broadband Network. These articles triggered a complaint to the Australian Press Council, alleging that they were factually incorrect, unbalanced and misleading. In December 2011, the Press Council upheld the complaints on all three articles, forcing The Telegraph to publish the adjudication. The Council also published the following statement in regards to the issue: =Press Council complaint regarding Mark Latham article (Sunday Telegraph)= In December 2011, The Sunday Telegraph published two articles about former Labor leader Mark Latham and an alleged argument he had with his child's swimming teacher. Mr Latham complained to the Australian Press Council that there was a conflict of interest which should have been disclosed as the reporter was the daughter of one of the swim teachers at the school. Mr Latham also complained that the articles breached the privacy of his family, especially his young children, and were not in the public interest. The Press Council upheld the complaint and published the following statement (extract only): The Council also found that there had been an \\"unreasonable intrusion on the children's privacy\\" and upheld that aspect of the complaint. =Press Council complaint regarding asylum seeker article= In November 2011, The Telegraph published an article about asylum seekers with the front-page heading 'OPEN THE FLOODGATES ‚Äì Exclusive: Thousands of boat people to invade NSW'. Another headline stated 'Detainee Deluge for Sydney'. This prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council, which was upheld. The Press Council published the following statement (extract only): =Press Council complaint regarding series of Clover Moore articles= Throughout 2011, The Telegraph published 17 articles about Sydney Lord Mayor and MP Clover Moore. The articles prompted a complaint to the Australian Press Council. The complainant argued that the articles provided unbalanced coverage and that many of the headlines and phrases were opinion rather than fact. The Press Council upheld the complaint in part and published the following statement (extract only): This adjudication marked the 4th complaint to have been upheld against The Daily Telegraph under the editorship of Paul Whittaker, since commencing the role in April 2011.\\"A new editor for the Daily Telegraph ‚Äì Paul Whittaker\\" , The Daily Telegraph (Australia) =Photoshopping of Mike Carlton onto Boston bombing victim= Following the resignation of Fairfax commentator Mike Carlton, The Daily Telegraph published a 2-page spread attacking Carlton and competing newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald. The spread included a composited image of Boston Marathon bombing victim James Costello, with Mr Carlton's face and wearing an Arab headdress. The photoshopped image portrayed Carlton 'escaping Gaza'. The image manipulation drew widespread criticism on social media, and forced the editor to apologise, saying he was unaware of the origin of the image. Counterparts On Sundays, its counterpart is The Sunday Telegraph. Its Melbourne counterparts are the Herald Sun and Sunday Herald Sun. In Brisbane, it is linked with The Courier- Mail and The Sunday Mail, in Adelaide, The Advertiser and Sunday Mail, in Hobart, The Mercury and The Sunday Tasmanian, in Darwin, The Northern Territory News and Sunday Territorian.  Political stance  The Daily Telegraph has traditionally been opposed to the Australian Labor Party, and is often a supporter of the Liberal Party of Australia. A 2013 front-page headline said of the second Rudd Government \\"Finally, you now have the chance to kick this mob out\\" and \\"Australia Needs Tony\\". The paper's high-profile columnists are predominantly conservative, including Piers Akerman, Miranda Devine, Tim Blair and Andrew Bolt. A Roy Morgan media credibility survey found that 40 per cent of journalists viewed News Limited newspapers as Australia's most partisan media outlet, ahead of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 25 per cent. The survey found that readers took a generally dim view of journalists. In response to the question \\"Which newspapers do you believe do not accurately and fairly report the news?\\", the Daily Telegraph came third (9%) behind the Herald Sun (11%) and \\"All of them\\" (16%). At the 2007 Australian federal election The Daily Telegraph for only the second time endorsed the Australian Labor Party. At the 2010 Australian federal election the Newspaper endorsed the Coalition and Tony Abbott. In the 2013 election, the Daily Telegraph ran 177 stories that were pro Coalition 11 stories that leaned the other way. During both the 2016 and 2019 Australian federal elections, The Daily Telegraph strongly endorsed prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison respectively, both of the Liberal Party, while attacking then-opposition leader Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor party lost both elections. Continued praise of the Coalition provides consistently high approval ratings for prime minister Scott Morrison, when compared to federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese.

About QuakeNet Founded in 1997 as an IRC network for QuakeWorld players, QuakeNet saw huge growth over the coming years as it attracted many other gamers. As interest in IRC started to decline, QuakeNet's userbase followed suit. Services Channels often feature QuakeNet's requestable bespoke channel service 'Q'. Q is the main channel service and manages account authentication similar to nickname registration on servers with Nickserv; although there is no nickname protection service, instead operating on a first come first served basis. The other popular channel service seen in the larger channels is 'S'. S is SpamScan, a service used to detect spam from channels and warn or later punish the offending users. Since April 2014, D was also added as a channel service which collects various statistic metrics about a channel, such as word counts and popular phrases. Additional services include O as an operserv reference bot to the server operators on QuakeNet, and R (RequestBot) which allows users to request both Q and S if their channel meets their requirements. There are many other backend services which help QuakeNet staff administer the network. QuakeNet also is the home to many other third- party bot-operated services that can be used for various purposes to assist channel operators to run their channels or provide light entertainment. Many of these channels can be found using the channel search facility on the QuakeNet website. Webchat QuakeNet has a webchat client which allows users to connect to the network without the use of a dedicated IRC client. The client software, called qwebirc was created by the QuakeNet development team. It is often embedded into other websites and also used by other IRC networks.

The condition can occur in almost any species of warm-blooded animal (i.e. mammals and birds), including humans. Although pediculosis in humans may properly refer to lice infestation of any part of the body, the term is sometimes used loosely to refer to pediculosis capitis, the infestation of the human head with the specific head louse.  Classification  Pediculosis may be divided into the following types: :* Pediculosis capitis (Head lice infestation) :* Pediculosis corporis (Pediculosis vestimenti, Vagabond's disease) :* Pediculosis pubis (Crabs) Head lice =Presentation= Head louse crawling on a hairbrush Pediculosis in the head of a 6-year-old boy caused by the head louse, as confirmed by optical (c) and electron microscopy (d). Head-lice infestation is most frequent on children aged 3‚Äì10 and their families. Approximately 3% of school children in the United States contract head lice. Females aged 3‚Äì12 years are most commonly infested. Those of African descent rarely suffer infestation due to differences in hair texture. Head lice are spread through direct head-to-head contact with an infested person. From each egg or \\"nit\\" may hatch one nymph that will grow and develop to the adult louse. Lice feed on blood once or more often each day by piercing the skin with their tiny needle-like mouthparts. While feeding they excrete saliva, which irritates the skin and causes itching. Lice cannot burrow into the skin. =Diagnosis= To diagnose infestation, the entire scalp should be combed thoroughly with a louse comb and the teeth of the comb should be examined for the presence of living lice after each time the comb passes through the hair. The use of a louse comb is the most effective way to detect living lice. The most characteristic symptom of infestation is pruritus (itching) on the head which normally intensifies 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation. The bite reaction is very mild and it can be rarely seen between the hairs. Excessive scratching of the infested areas can cause sores, which may become infected. =Treatment= The number of diagnosed cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually. There is no product or method which assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However, there are a number of treatment methods that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air, silicone-based lotions, and ethanol (ethyl alcohol).Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, common alcohol) is toxic to arthropods including lice. It can be mixed with the everyday hair conditioner for a treatment. Ethanol as an arthropod killing solution. Pediculosis is commonly treated with permethrin lotion. =Epidemiology= About 14 million people, mainly children, are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. Only a small proportion of those treated, however, may have objective evidence of an extant infestation. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world including Denmark, Sweden, U.K., France and Australia. Normally head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, brushes, towels, clothing, beds or closets. Head-to-head contact is by far the most common route of lice transmission. The United Kingdom's National Health Service, and many American health agencies,Head lice and nits - NHS Choices. Nhs.uk (2016-05-17). Retrieved on 2016-10-14. report that lice \\"prefer\\" clean hair, because it's easier to attach eggs and to cling to the strands. Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) are not known to be vectors of diseases, unlike body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), which are known vectors of epidemic or louse-borne typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), trench fever (Rochalimaea quintana) and louse-borne relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis). Body lice This condition is caused by body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus, sometimes called Pediculus humanus corporis), a louse which infests humans and is adapted to lay eggs in clothing, rather than at the base of hairs, and is thus of recent evolutionary origin. Pediculosis is a more serious threat due to possible contagion of diseases such as typhus. Epidemiology and treatment of human body lice is described in the article on body lice. Pubic lice The pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis) is a parasitic insect which spends its entire life on human hair and feeds exclusively on blood. Humans are the only known host of this parasite, although it is more closely related to the louse parasites in other primate species, than are human head or body lice which probably evolved from it as the \\"original\\" louse infestation of humans. Epidemiology and treatment of pubic lice is discussed in the article on pubic lice. Other animals Pediculosis is more common in cattle than any other type of domesticated animal. This is a significant problem, as it can cause weight loss of 55 to 75 pounds per animal. Some species of lice infesting cattle include the cattle biting louse (Bovicola bovis), the shortnosed cattle louse (Haematopinus eurysternus), the longnosed cattle louse (Linognathus vituli), and the little blue cattle louse (Solenopotes capillatus). =Treatment= Cattle infested with bovine pediculosis are generally treated chemically, by drugs like ivermectin and cypermethrin.  History  In the 15th century, topical mercury treatment was used to treat pediculosis.

It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet and mouth and occasionally buttocks and groin. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3‚Äì6 days after exposure to the virus. The rash generally resolves on its own in about a week. Fingernail and toenail loss may occur a few weeks later, but they will regrow with time. The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact, through the air from coughing and the feces of an infected person. Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause, and enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. Other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. Other animals are not involved. Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. Occasionally, a throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus. Handwashing may prevent spread, and those infected should not go to work, daycare or school. No antiviral medication or vaccine is available, but development efforts are underway. Most cases require no specific treatment. Simple pain medication such as ibuprofen or numbing mouth gel may be used. Occasionally, intravenous fluids are given to children who are unable to drink enough. Rarely, viral meningitis or encephalitis may complicate the disease. HFMD occurs in all areas of the world. It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. Large outbreaks have been occurring in Asia since 1997. It usually occurs during the spring, summer and fall months. Typically it occurs in children less than five years old but can occasionally occur in adults. HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof- and-mouth disease), which mostly affects livestock.  Signs and symptoms  Common constitutional signs and symptoms of the HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants and toddlers. Skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, buttocks, and sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7‚Äì10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.

File:Hand Foot Mouth Disease Adult 36Years.jpgRash on hand and feet of a 36-year-old man File:Hand foot and mouth disease on child feet.jpgRash on the soles of a child's feet Cause The viruses that cause the disease are of the Picornaviridae family. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. =Transmission= HFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission. It is possible to be infectious for days to weeks after the symptoms have resolved. Child care settings are the most common places for HFMD to be contracted because of the bathroom training, diaper changes, and that children often put their hands into their mouths. Children who do not attend a preschool or kindergarten were found to be more susceptible to the disease. HFMD is contracted through nose and throat secretions such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus and as well as fluid in blisters, and stool. Diagnosis A diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture. The common incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from three to six days. Early detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population. Prevention Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD. Protective habits include hand washing and disinfecting surfaces in play areas. Breast-feeding has also shown to decrease rates of severe HFMD, though does not reduce the risk for the infection of the disease. =Vaccine= A vaccine known as the EV71 vaccine is available to prevent HFMD in China . No vaccine is currently available in the United States. Treatment Medications are usually not needed as hand, foot, and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically resolves on its own. Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. Disease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately 1 week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers and lukewarm baths can help decrease body temperature. A minority of individuals with hand, foot and mouth disease may require hospital admission due to complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute flaccid paralysis. Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur. Complications Complications from the viral infections that cause HFMD are rare, but require immediate medical treatment if present. HFMD infections caused by Enterovirus 71 tend to be more severe and are more likely to have neurologic or cardiac complications including death than infections caused by Coxsackievirus A16. Viral or aseptic meningitis can occur with HFMD in rare cases and is characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The condition is usually mild and clears without treatment; however, hospitalization for a short time may be needed. Other serious complications of HFMD include encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or flaccid paralysis in rare circumstances. Fingernail and toenail loss have been reported in children 4‚Äì8 weeks after having HFMD. The relationship between HFMD and the reported nail loss is unclear; however, it is temporary and nail growth resumes without treatment. Minor complications due to symptoms can occur such as dehydration, due to mouth sores causing discomfort with intake of foods and fluid. Epidemiology Hand, foot and mouth disease most commonly occurs in children under the age of 10. It tends to occur in outbreaks during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. This is believed to be due to heat and humidity improving spread. HFMD is more common in rural areas than urban areas; however, socioeconomic status and hygiene levels need to be considered. Poor hygiene is a risk factor for HFMD. Outbreaks have occurred in China, Japan, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Vietnam. HFMD most commonly affects young children under the age of 10 and more often under the age of 5, but can also affect adults with varying symptoms. Since 1997 there have been 71 large enterovirus outbreaks reported, mostly in East and South East Asia, primarily affecting children. From the years 2008 to 2014, more than 1 million HFMD cases have been reported in China each year. =Outbreaks= * In 1997, an outbreak occurred in Sarawak of Malaysia with 600 cases and over 30 children died. * In 1998, there was an outbreak in Taiwan, affecting mainly children. There were 405 severe complications, and 78 children died. The total number of cases in that epidemic is estimated to have been 1.5 million. * In 2008 an outbreak in China, beginning in March in Fuyang, Anhui, led to 25,000 infections, and 42 deaths, by May 13. Similar outbreaks were reported in Singapore (more than 2,600 cases as of April 20, 2008), Vietnam (2,300 cases, 11 deaths),Viet Nam News: HFMD cases prompt tighter health screening at airport (accessed May 15, 2008) Mongolia (1,600 cases),EV-71 Virus Continues Dramatic Rise (accessed May 23, 2008) and Brunei (1053 cases from June‚ÄìAugust 2008) * In 2009 17 children died in an outbreak during March and April 2009 in China's eastern Shandong Province, and 18 children died in the neighboring Henan Province. Out of 115,000 reported cases in China from January to April, 773 were severe and 50 were fatal. * In 2010 in China, an outbreak occurred in southern China's Guangxi Autonomous Region as well as Guangdong, Henan, Hebei and Shandong provinces. Until March, 70,756 children were infected and 40 died from the disease. By June, the peak season for the disease, 537 had died. * The World Health Organization reporting between January to October 2011 (1,340,259) states the number of cases in China had dropped by approx 300,000 from 2010 (1,654,866) cases, with new cases peaking in June. There were 437 deaths, down from 2010 (537 deaths). * In December 2011, the California Department of Public Health identified a strong form of the virus, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), where nail loss in children is common. * In 2012 in Alabama, United States there was an outbreak of an unusual type of the disease. It occurred in a season when it is not usually seen and affected teenagers and older adults. There were some hospitalizations due to the disease but no reported deaths. * In 2012 in Cambodia, 52 of 59 reviewed cases of children reportedly dead () due to a mysterious disease were diagnosed to be caused by a virulent form of HFMD. Although a significant degree of uncertainty exists with reference to the diagnosis, the WHO report states, \\"Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients.\\" * HFMD infected 1,520,274 people with up to 431 deaths reported at the end of July in 2012 in China. * In 2018, more than 50,000 cases have occurred through a nationwide outbreak in Malaysia with two deaths also reported. History HFMD cases were first described clinically in Canada and New Zealand in 1957. The disease was termed \\"Hand Foot and Mouth Disease\\", by Thomas Henry Flewett, after a similar outbreak in 1960. Research Novel antiviral agents to prevent and treat infection with the viruses responsible for HFMD are currently under development. Preliminary studies have shown inhibitors of the EV-71 viral capsid to have potent antiviral activity.

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, encephalitis, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a miscarriage or a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Symptoms of CRS manifest as problems with the eyes such as cataracts, deafness, as well as affecting the heart and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy. Rubella is usually spread from one person to the next through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year. Only humans are infected. Insects do not spread the disease. Once recovered, people are immune to future infections. Testing is available that can verify immunity. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding the virus in the blood, throat, or urine. Testing the blood for antibodies may also be useful. Rubella is preventable with the rubella vaccine with a single dose being more than 95% effective. Often it is given in combination with the measles vaccine and mumps vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine. When some, but less than 80%, of a population is vaccinated, more women may reach childbearing age without developing immunity by infection or vaccination, thus possibly raising CRS rates. Once infected there is no specific treatment. Rubella is a common infection in many areas of the world. Each year about 100,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome occur. Rates of disease have decreased in many areas as a result of vaccination. There are ongoing efforts to eliminate the disease globally. In April 2015 the World Health Organization declared the Americas free of rubella transmission. The name \\"rubella\\" is from Latin and means little red. It was first described as a separate disease by German physicians in 1814 resulting in the name \\"German measles\\". Signs and symptoms Young boy displaying the characteristic maculopapular rash of rubella Generalized rash on the abdomen due to rubella Rubella has symptoms similar to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days, which is why it is often referred to as three-day measles. The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low- grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis. The swollen glands or lymph nodes can persist for up to a week and the fever rarely rises above 38¬∞C (100.4¬∞F). The rash of rubella is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer spots occur in 20% of cases and is characterized by small, red papules on the area of the soft palate.Robert Kliegman, Waldo E. Nelson, Hal B. Jenson, Karen J. Marcdante, M.D., Richard E. Behrman. Nelson Essentials of Pediatrics, page 467. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2006. . Rubella can affect anyone of any age. Adult women are particularly prone to arthritis and joint pains. In children, rubella normally causes symptoms which last two days and include: * Rash beginning on the face which spreads to the rest of the body. * Low fever of less than 38.3¬∞C (101¬∞F). * Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. In older children and adults, additional symptoms may be present, including: * Swollen glands * Coryza (cold-like symptoms) * Aching joints (especially in young women) Severe complications of rubella include: * Brain inflammation (encephalitis) * Low platelet count * Ear infection Coryza in rubella may convert to pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). =Congenital rubella syndrome= Child with cataracts in both eyes due to congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella can cause congenital rubella syndrome in the newborn, this being the most severe sequela of rubella. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects. It may also cause prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of major defects or organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester. CRS is the main reason a vaccine for rubella was developed. Many mothers who contract rubella within the critical first trimester have either a miscarriage or a stillborn baby. If the fetus survives the infection, it can be born with severe heart disorders (patent ductus arteriosus being the most common), blindness, deafness, or other life- threatening organ disorders. The skin manifestations are called \\"blueberry muffin lesions\\". For these reasons, rubella is included on the TORCH complex of perinatal infections. About 100,000 cases of this condition occur each year. Cause Transmission electron micrograph of rubella viruses The disease is caused by the rubella virus, in the genus Rubivirus from the family Matonaviridae, that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome. The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes. The virus is found in the blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has teratogenic properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them. During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter. Increased susceptibility to infection might be inherited as there is some indication that HLA-A1 or factors surrounding A1 on extended haplotypes are involved in virus infection or non-resolution of the disease. Diagnosis Rubella virus specific IgM antibodies are present in people recently infected by rubella virus, but these antibodies can persist for over a year, and a positive test result needs to be interpreted with caution. The presence of these antibodies along with, or a short time after, the characteristic rash confirms the diagnosis. Prevention Rubella infections are prevented by active immunisation programs using live attenuated virus vaccines. Two live attenuated virus vaccines, RA 27/3 and Cendehill strains, were effective in the prevention of adult disease. However their use in prepubertal females did not produce a significant fall in the overall incidence rate of CRS in the UK. Reductions were only achieved by immunisation of all children. The vaccine is now usually given as part of the MMR vaccine. The WHO recommends the first dose be given at 12 to 18 months of age with a second dose at 36 months. Pregnant women are usually tested for immunity to rubella early on. Women found to be susceptible are not vaccinated until after the baby is born because the vaccine contains live virus. The immunisation program has been quite successful. Cuba declared the disease eliminated in the 1990s, and in 2004 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that both the congenital and acquired forms of rubella had been eliminated from the United States. The World Health Organisation declared Australia rubella free in October 2018. Screening for rubella susceptibility by history of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States for all women of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care. Fourteenth Edition. By the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement July 2010. It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant women of childbearing age should be offered rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period. In susceptible people passive immunization, in the form of Polyclonal immunoglobulins appears effective up to the fifth day post-exposure. Treatment There is no specific treatment for rubella; however, management is a matter of responding to symptoms to diminish discomfort. Treatment of newborn babies is focused on management of the complications. Congenital heart defects and cataracts can be corrected by direct surgery. Management for ocular congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is similar to that for age-related macular degeneration, including counseling, regular monitoring, and the provision of low vision devices, if required. Prognosis Rubella infection of children and adults is usually mild, self-limiting and often asymptomatic. The prognosis in children born with CRS is poor. Epidemiology Rubella occurs worldwide. The virus tends to peak during the spring in countries with temperate climates. Before the vaccine against rubella was introduced in 1969, widespread outbreaks usually occurred every 6‚Äì9 years in the United States and 3‚Äì5 years in Europe, mostly affecting children in the 5-9 year old age group. Since the introduction of vaccine, occurrences have become rare in those countries with high uptake rates. Vaccination has interrupted the transmission of rubella in the Americas: no endemic case has been observed since February 2009. Accessed 2010-04-10. Vaccination is still strongly recommended as the virus could be reintroduced from other continents should vaccination rates in the Americas drop. During the epidemic in the U.S. between 1962 and 1965, rubella virus infections during pregnancy were estimated to have caused 30,000 stillbirths and 20,000 children to be born impaired or disabled as a result of CRS. Universal immunisation producing a high level of herd immunity is important in the control of epidemics of rubella. In the UK, there remains a large population of men susceptible to rubella who have not been vaccinated. Outbreaks of rubella occurred amongst many young men in the UK in 1993 and in 1996 the infection was transmitted to pregnant women, many of whom were immigrants and were susceptible. Outbreaks still arise, usually in developing countries where the vaccine is not as accessible. The complications encountered in pregnancy from rubella infection (miscarriage, fetal death, congenital rubella syndrome) are more common in Africa and Southeast Asia at a rate of 121 per 100,000 live births compared to 2 per 100,000 live births in the Americas and Europe. In Japan, 15,000 cases of rubella and 43 cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases between October 15, 2012, and March 2, 2014, during the 2012‚Äì13 rubella outbreak in Japan. They mainly occurred in men of ages 31 to 51 and young adults aged 24‚Äì34. History Rubella was first described in the mid-eighteenth century. German physician and chemist, Friedrich Hoffmann, made the first clinical description of rubella in 1740, which was confirmed by de Bergen in 1752 and Orlow in 1758. In 1814, George de Maton first suggested that it be considered a disease distinct from both measles and scarlet fever. All these physicians were German, and the disease was known as R√∂theln (contemporary German R√∂teln), R√∂tlich means \\"redish\\" or \\"pink\\" in German. The fact that three Germans described it led to the common name of \\"German measles.\\" Henry Veale, an English Royal Artillery surgeon, described an outbreak in India. He coined the name \\"rubella\\" (from the Latin word, meaning \\"little red\\") in 1866. It was formally recognised as an individual entity in 1881, at the International Congress of Medicine in London. In 1914, Alfred Fabian Hess theorised that rubella was caused by a virus, based on work with monkeys. as cited by In 1938, Hiro and Tosaka confirmed this by passing the disease to children using filtered nasal washings from acute cases. In 1940, there was a widespread epidemic of rubella in Australia. Subsequently, ophthalmologist Norman McAllister Gregg found 78 cases of congenital cataracts in infants and 68 of them were born to mothers who had caught rubella in early pregnancy. Gregg published an account, Congenital Cataract Following German Measles in the Mother, in 1941. He described a variety of problems now known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and noticed that the earlier the mother was infected, the worse the damage was. Since no vaccine was yet available, some popular magazines promoted the idea of \\"German measles parties\\" for infected children to spread the disease to other children (especially girls) to immunize them for life and protect them from later catching the disease when pregnant. The virus was isolated in tissue culture in 1962 by two separate groups led by physicians Paul Douglas Parkman and Thomas Huckle Weller. There was a pandemic of rubella between 1962 and 1965, starting in Europe and spreading to the United States. In the years 1964‚Äì65, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases. This led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Of these, 2,100 died as neonates, 12,000 were deaf, 3,580 were blind, and 1,800 were intellectually disabled. In New York alone, CRS affected 1% of all births.J.B. Hanshaw, J.A. Dudgeon, and W.C. Marshall. Viral diseases of the fetus and newborn. W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1985 In 1967, the molecular structure of rubella was observed under electron microscopy using antigen-antibody complexes by Jennifer M. Best, June Almeida, J E Banatvala and A P Waterson. In 1969, a live attenuated virus vaccine was licensed. In the early 1970s, a triple vaccine containing attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) viruses was introduced. By 2006, confirmed cases in the Americas had dropped below 3000 a year. However, a 2007 outbreak in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile pushed the cases to 13,000 that year. On January 22, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization declared and certified Colombia free of rubella and became the first Latin American country to eliminate the disease within its borders. On April 29, 2015, the Americas became the first WHO region to officially eradicate the disease. The last non-imported cases occurred in 2009 in Argentina and Brazil. Pan-American Health Organization director remarked \\"The fight against rubella has taken more than 15 years, but it has paid off with what I believe will be one of the most important pan-American public health achievements of the 21st Century.\\" The declaration was made after 165 million health records and genetically confirming that all recent cases were caused by known imported strains of the virus. Rubella is still common in some regions of the world and Susan E. Reef, team lead for rubella at the C.D.C.‚Äôs global immunization division, who joined in the announcement, said there was no chance it would be eradicated worldwide before 2020. Rubella is the third disease to be eliminated from the western hemisphere with vaccination after smallpox and polio. Etymology The name rubella is sometimes confused with rubeola, an alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries; the diseases are unrelated.Merriam-Webster:Rubeola Accessed 2009-09-20. In some other European languages, like Spanish, rubella and rubeola are synonyms, and rubeola is not an alternative name for measles. Thus, in Spanish, \\"rubeola\\" refers to rubella and \\"sarampi√≥n\\" refers to measles.
