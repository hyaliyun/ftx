He was most distinguished for his pioneering work in the field of kidney transplantations, and in research, discoveries, and inventions in Renal Science. In 1961, while working at the Stanford University Medical Center, he performed the first successful Kidney transplant between humans who were not identical twins. Six years later, he and a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, developed the prototype for the Belzer kidney perfusion machine, a device that can preserve kidneys for up to 50 hours from the time they are taken from a donor's body. It is now standard equipment in hospitals and research laboratories around the world.\\\\- Stanford School of MedicineNew York Times, December 24, 1981. Early life and career Samuel Lee Kountz, the eldest son of a Baptist minister, J. S. Kountz, was born in Lexa, Arkansas, in 1930. He first became interested in medicine at the age of eight, when he accompanied an injured friend to a local hospital for emergency treatment. He was so moved by the doctors' ability to relieve his friend's suffering that he decided from that moment to become a physician.\\"A human healer from Arkansas\\", African American Registry. He completed his early education in Lexa, then spent three years at a Baptist boarding school for young people considering the ministry. He later graduated from Morris Booker College High School in Dermott, Arkansas (Chicot County).Encyclopedia of Arkansas. Although the school provided him with the discipline he needed, its academic program was inadequate, and he was forced to take remedial courses before gaining admission to the Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College of Arkansas (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). After much improvement, he graduated third in his class in 1952. During his senior year, Kountz had met Senator J. William Fulbright, who had once been president of the University of Arkansas. Impressed by Kountz's energy and enthusiasm, Fulbright asked him what he planned to do following graduation. Kountz told him that he hoped to attend a black medical school, where he could realize his lifelong dream of becoming a surgeon. Fulbright urged him to consider the medical school at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, instead. Kountz applied but was rejected; he spent the next two years completing graduate work in chemistry at the university's Fayetteville campus. Then, on the basis of his accomplishments, he was awarded a full medical scholarship, and in 1954 was admitted to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Kountz completed a master's degree in chemistry in 1956; two years later he received his M.D. He spent the next year as an intern with the highly competitive Stanford Service of San Francisco General Hospital, and, in 1959, he began his surgical training at the Stanford University School of Medicine. It was at Stanford that he studied the field of organ transplantation, and decided to make transplant surgery his life's work. He was still a resident in 1961, when he made medical history by performing the first kidney transplant using a non- twin donor. Among Kountz's other contributions were the discovery that large doses of the steroid drug methylprednisolone could reverse acute rejection of a transplanted kidney, and that re-implantation (the implantation of a second donor kidney at the earliest indication that the first might be rejected) could mean the difference between the death and survival for transplant patients. A tireless proponent of organ donation, he once performed a kidney transplant on live television, The Today Show, in 1976, inspiring some 20,000 viewers to offer their kidneys to patients who needed them. In addition, his groundbreaking research in the area of tissue typing helped improve the results of kidney transplantation and led to the increased use of kidneys from unrelated donors. Kountz was appointed Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department at the State University of New York (SUNY), Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York beginning in 1972 and Surgeon-in-Chief of Kings County Hospital. The University of Arkansas awarded him the honorary Juris Doctor in 1973. He developed the largest kidney transplant research and training program in the country at the University of California, San Francisco. At the time of his death, he had personally performed some 500 kidney transplants, the most performed by any physician in the world at that time.Encyclopedia of Arkansas.

Illness and death While on a lecture tour in South Africa in 1977, Dr. Kountz contracted a crippling brain disease that left him neurologically impaired and confined to his bed, unable to communicate, or care for himself, for the rest of his life. His illness was never diagnosed, and he died on December 23, 1981, at the age of 51. In July 1980 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People presented an Afro- Academic, Technological, and Scientific Olympics program award, which is a special high school science award for African American students, in his honor. Five years later the World's First International Symposium on Renal (kidney) Failure and Transplantation in Blacks was dedicated to his memory.

In addition to radar facilities and a NORAD Control Center the site had support services: NCO club, bowling alley, hobby shops, library, movie theater, barber shop, exchange, commissary, grade school, and housing for officers and senior NCOs.Winkler & Webster History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Simpson, Montana as a site for one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the United States Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 1 March 1951 the 778th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at SimpsonCornett & Johnson, p. 167 and began operating AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars. Initially, the station functioned as a ground control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. =Havre Air Force Station= The site was renamed Havre Air Force Station on 1 December 1953. The Air Force added an AN/GPS-3 radar c. late 1958 that stayed until 1965. During 1961 Havre AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, when a Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Set was installed to transfer radar track data to Air Defense Direction Center DC-20 at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. After joining SAGE, the squadron was redesignated as the 778th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 March 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-25. In the early 1960s AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6B radars took over height-finder duties. The AN/FPS-6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 in 1964; it was deactivated in 1969. In 1965 an AN/FPS-27 replaced the AN/GPS-3 as the search radar. In addition to the main facility, Havre operated two AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Galata, Montana (P-25A) * Hogeland, Montana (P-25B) =Backup Interceptor Control= Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 778th Radar Sq was inactivated and replaced by the 778th Air Defense Group in March 1970.Cornett & Johnson, p.86 The upgrade to group status was done because of Havre AFS' status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 778th Radar Squadron. as defenses against manned bombers were reduced. Havre AFS was assigned to Malmstrom Air Force Base on 17 June 1974. Prior to the December 1979 breakup of Aerospace Defense Command, during the Department of Defense announced the proposed closure of \\"40 obsolete air defense radar stations\\", 95 military and 25 civilian positions were lost and Havre AFS closed on 1 July 1979.

The manuscript is currently dated by the INTF to the 15th century. The early story of the manuscript and its provenance is unknown. It was held at the Dominican monastery in Basel in the beginning of the 16th century. Since 1559 it was held at the University of Basel. Desiderius Erasmus received this codex from the Dominican friars in Basel, and used it for the first edition of his Novum Instrumentum omne (1516).. Robert Estienne did not use this manuscript in his Editio Regia (1550), but his edition was based on the Erasman text. As a result, some of its readings appear in the Textus Receptus. It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Gregory (817e). Gregory saw it in 1885. The manuscript is now housed at the Basel University Library with the shelf number A. N. III, 15.

King, 533 U.S. 158 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the extent to which the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) applied to certain types of corporation-individual organizations. In this case, the Court decided unanimously to apply it to Respondent Don King. Background Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd., a corporate promoter of boxing matches, sued Don King, the president and sole shareholder of a rival corporation, alleging that King had conducted his corporation's affairs in violation of RICO. RICO makes it \\"unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise... to conduct or participate... in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\\" The District Court dismissed the complaint. In affirming the decision, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that RICO applies only where a plaintiff shows the existence of two separate entities, a \\"person\\" and a distinct \\"enterprise,\\" the affairs of which that \\"person\\" improperly conducts. The court concluded that King was part of the corporation, not a \\"person,\\" distinct from the \\"enterprise,\\" who allegedly improperly conducted the \\"enterprise's affairs.\\" Opinion of the Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the decision of the Court, which unanimously reversed the appellate court. The Court held that \\"the need for two distinct entities is satisfied; hence, the RICO provision... applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole owner -- whether he conducts those affairs within the scope, or beyond the scope, of corporate authority.\\" \\"The corporate owner/employee, a natural person, is distinct from the corporation itself, a legally different entity,\\" Justice Breyer wrote. \\"A corporate employee who conducts the corporation's affairs through an unlawful RICO 'pattern... of activity,' uses that corporation as a 'vehicle' whether he is, or is not, its sole owner.\\" Under this reading of the statute, the Court of appeals' decision was reached in error; the case was sent back to them for future disposition of the case.

She has won three Academy Awards, for the films Beetlejuice, Mrs. Doubtfire and Ed Wood. She has been nominated for eight Oscars in total.  Early life  Neill recounts that she aspired to be a make-up artist since the age of five and wanted to create monsters. As a child, she was known for painting the faces of her cousins with whatever was at hand, such as lipstick and shoe polish. Her interest in the makeup world was broadened by Leo Lotito, a make-up artist for TV shows who helped her with her Halloween costumes. A trip to a science- fiction convention at the age of 18 to gather inspiration ended with Fred Phillips taking her under his wing and a job on Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Make-Up  At the same Sci-Fi convention where she met Fred Phillips, Neill approached men dressed as characters from Planet of the Apes after learning that they made their own masks. When she asked them to teach her, one responded: “But you're a girl\\". This incident became part of her journey to learn all that she could and build her skills and techniques. Neill credits self teaching, with the addition of other make-up artists showing her tips and tricks. She credits being able to examine the legendary work of John Chambers and Fred Phillips, in order to grow as an artist. While she was developing her skills, there was a lack of sharing between her and her male counterparts, as she was a woman and \\"they didn't want me in there anyway.\\" In interviews, she has also warned women artists that, generally speaking, the job makes it extremely difficult to juggle being married and having children in the field. = CGI = Neill has made several comments on the benefit of using CGI to enhance the makeups created by artists. \\"CGI is a helpful tool, but will never be the sole method in the field.\\"  Positions  Neill serves as a judge on the Syfy original series Face Off which features makeup artists competing for $100,000.

Marc- Michel Rey (; 5 May 1720 – 8 June 1780) was an influential publisher in the United Provinces, who published many of the works of the French philosophes, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In his day, he was the largest and most important publisher in the French language in the United Provinces. Biography Rey was born in Geneva, Republic of Geneva in 1720, son of French Huguenot parents. He later wrote that he had little schooling. He was an apprentice to a Genevan bookseller Marc-Michel Bosquet from 1733 to 1744. After moving to Amsterdam in 1744, he purchased citizenship and opened a publishing business. In 1746 he married Elisabeth Bernard, daughter of the bookseller J. F. Bernard, who brought her father's stock with her. The business flourished as a result. Rey never became fluent in Dutch, but entertained himself lavishly within the French-speaking social circle. He published mainly in French, and most of his sales were in France, although his books were sold in Russia and in the Dutch overseas colonies. Although he was a member of the local Walloon church, he published material that was offensive to the church, including Voltaire's attacks on the priestly order. He was Rousseau's main publisher and also published the works of Diderot. These authors praised him for publishing their books but also accused him of taking most of the profits. Rey had to deal with pressure from the French, Dutch and Genevan authorities and pastors, but continued to publish controversial books such as Rousseau's Emile and all the works of Baron d'Holbach.

Following this, he founded the fire detector distributor Dynamics, Inc. After his sale of the company, he worked in various positions with Avon, including president of Avon USA. In 1992 he joined Tupperware Worldwide as the CEO. Early life After high school, Goings served in the US Navy as a navigator on the USS Power, a World War II-era destroyer in the Red Sea during the Vietnam War. Goings was a platoon leader out of boot camp, and was honorably discharged from the Navy at the rank of petty officer. He then attended Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he majored in History. In his youth Goings also worked in several retail or direct-sales positions. Dynamics, Inc. While in his senior year of college, Goings founded one of the first direct sales of home fire alarm systems - the \\"Pyro Sentinel Heat Detection System\\" distributorship, in the United States. He hired fellow students to work in direct sales for the heat detectors, creating \\"fire safety crusaders\\" in their neighborhoods in order to raise awareness for fire safety. At the time fire alarms were not common and smoke detectors hadn't been introduced yet in US homes. Goings dropped out of college to pursue the company full-time, split up with his partner, and reformed the company in Charlottesville, Virginia as Dynamics, Inc. Goings began to franchise Dynamics, and within a few years the company had 300 locations across the US. He led the company for fifteen years, until the Federal Government made smoke detectors mandatory and major retailers began carrying them in competition with Goings. He then sold his interest in the company. Tupperware Brands Corporation Following the sale of Dynamics, Goings began working with Avon Products, Inc. in 1985, where he held several positions including president of Avon Germany, group vice president and senior operating officer for the Pacific Rim, and president of Avon USA. He joined Tupperware in 1992 as president of Tupperware Worldwide. One of his first actions was to turn the company's attentions to the overseas market, in order to compensate for the increasing difficulty of direct-sales models in the United States. The two markets Goings focused on most were Latin America and Asia, where \\"Tupperware home party social-networking\\" proved to be popular in a way that it once was in the United States during the 1960s. Within four years the company was earning 95% of its revenues from outside the US, with revenues of about $1 billion. This led the company to be spun off from its parent company in 1996, with Goings remaining in the position of CEO. World Federation of Youth Clubs Following more than a decade of collaboration with a handful of International youth organizations, in 2019, the World Federation of Youth Clubs was officially founded. Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, it currently has member organizations operating in 24 countries outside of the United States. The 3,160 Club locations serve 336,000 youth and their families annually through facility-based organizations that provide educational programs, personal and leadership development, and family and community engagement.

He is the namesake of Colby College in Maine and the town of Colby, Wisconsin. Early life Colby was born in Bowdoinham, Maine in 1810 and spent part of his childhood in Waterville, Maine. His father, Josiah Colby, died in 1814 after having lost his fortune during the War of 1812, and Josiah Colby had spent time manufacturing gunpowder in Waterville before his death. To aid Colby's mother, Jeremiah Chaplin, a Baptist minister who served as the first President of Waterville College (later Colby College) arranged for the Colby family to operate a store in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Career Gardner Colby eventually started his own store in Boston and became involved in various other businesses including railroads, shipping and manufacturing. As a lifelong Baptist, Colby was very involved in various Christian causes.

The FRAP assay was first performed by Iris Benzie and J. J. Strain of the Human Nutrition Research Group at the University of Ulster, Coleraine. The method is based on the formation of O-Phenanthroline-Fe(2+) complex and its disruption in the presence of chelating agents. This assay is often used to measure the antioxidant capacity of foods, beverages and nutritional supplements containing polyphenols.  Experimental procedure  A reaction mixture containing 1 ml of 0.05% O -Phenanthroline in methanol, 2 ml ferric chloride (200 M) and 2 ml of various concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 g was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and the absorbance of the same was measured at 510 nm. EDTA was used as a classical metal chelator. The experiment was performed in triplicates. The ferric reducing activity of date seed extract was estimated based on the method of Benzie and Strain (1999). The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 50 ml of acetate buffer (0.3 M) at pH 3.6, 5 ml of tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ) solution 10 mM prepared in HCl (40 mM) and 5 ml of ferric chloride solution (FeCl3) (20 mM). 2 ml of the freshly prepared FRAP reagent was added to 10 lL of the extract. Then the absorbance was measured at 593 nm against the blank after 10 min at room temperature. The standard curve was constructed using Trolox. The result was expressed as Trolox equivalent in mg/100 g of dry weight (DW) date seed.

Biography Charlotte Clotilde Josephine Marie was born in Paris on April 3, 1815. She was the daughter of Simon Marie (1775-1855) an infantry captain in Napoleon's Grande Armée from a modest background, and Henriette Josephine de Ficquelmont (1780-1843), poor, but from the nobility of Lorraine.Maurice Wolff, Le roman de Clotilde de Vaux et de Auguste Comte, Perrin, 1929, page 4. The financial situation of her father, retired Captain Marie, was dire for a household with a wife and three children: Clotilde (born in 1815), Maximilian (born in 1819) and Leon (born in 1820) therefore, her father was given the office of tax collector in Méru near Paris to help him.Charles de Rouvre, L'amoureuse histoire d'Auguste comte et de Clotilde de Vaux, Calmann-Lévy, 1920. Clotilde spent her childhood in Méru with her two younger brothers Maximilien and Leon. Clotilde de Vaux was educated at the Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur. In 1835 she had a marriage of convenience with an Amédée de Vaux, who helped her father at his office of tax collector in Méru, but her husband turned out to be nothing but a rogue. After incurring enormous gambling debts, he eventually left his wife and fled to Belgium. According to the Code Civil of the time, women were unable to remarry without previously being divorced and, since no divorce had been issued, Clotilde was forbidden to do so. Consequently, she returned to Paris, first living with her parents before moving to her own place in Marais' rue Payenne. One of her uncles Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont, Minister-president of the Austrian Empire, granted her a housing allowance. Clotilde decided to begin a writer's career and wrote short stories for literary magazines. In October 1844, when visiting her brother, Clotilde met one of his Polytechnique's Professors, philosopher Auguste Comte. The first known letter from Comte to Clotilde is dated April 30, 1845 and from that day on it was very clear that he was in love with her, a love which Clotilde, a fervent Catholic, firmly rejected. Nonetheless she agreed to follow up with their correspondence and Comte's passionate love kept growing until Clotilde suddenly died of tuberculosis a year later. Comte, recognizing her as his muse, was highly impressed by her high morals which gave him the key to understand the religious dimension of the human condition. But if Clotilde was a fervent Catholic, Comte only considered Catholicism to be a stepHe considered Catholicism to be his second stage: the metaphysical stage towards the positive stage. Nonetheless, Clotilde's faith persuaded him to create a religion for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship.  Birth of the Religion of Humanity  View of Paris' Humanity Chapel, hosted in Clotilde's house rue Payenne Positivist Chapel in Porto Alegre (Brazil) In mourning after Clotilde's death, Comte dedicated himself to reorganise his previous philosophical system into a new positivist secular religion: the Positivist Church or Religion of Humanity. Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with a calendar reform called the 'positivist calendar' (with Sainte Clotilde's day each April 6 and a Day of Holy Women), liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême (New Supreme Great Being) made after Clotilde de Vaux. *In Système de politique positive (1851–1854), Auguste Comte expressed his idea of a \\" religion of Humanity \\", whose pillars are: **altruism, leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others. **order : Comte thought that after the French Revolution, society needed restoration of order. **progress : the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies. *In Catéchisme positiviste (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's sacraments : **the Introduction (nomination and sponsoring) **the Admission (end of education) **the Destination (choice of a career) **the Marriage, **the Retirement (age 63), **the Séparation, social extreme unction, **the Incorporation, 3 years after death. Comte's \\"Religion of Humanity\\" was rather unsuccessful in France but has been very influential in Latin America, especially in Brazil (see above) and has inspired the rise of the \\"Church of Humanity\\" in England and its variant in New York City, both being extremely small today.

Zagreb was the capital city of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a puppet state of Nazi Germany.Oružane akcije i diverzije, sa portala Zagreb se bori, Accessed 6 September 2010 At exactly 12.30 p.m. two muffled explosions were heard, all glass in the main post office building was broken, and through the window flew out a large quantity of office paper and all kinds of documents. On the second day came out in the Ustaša daily news paper Hrvatski narod, an official notice about the event at the General Post Office: \\"On 14 September this year at a time between 12:30-13 hours, four bombs exploded in the main post building in the department of telegrams and telephone. Eight people are injured, on this occasion, including two German soldiers and one officer and several policemen. Police clerk Škunca died of their wounds...\\"  Background  The sabotage was organized and conducted at the initiative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, by general secretary Rade Končar personally. Performance was entrusted to the Local Committee members: Blaž Mesarić, Antun Biber, Vojo Kovačević, Ante Milković (last two were arrested shortly before the explosion). Technical preparations are made by postal employees: Josip Čuljat, Slavko Markon, Vilim Galjer, and Nada Galjer. Čuljat and Markon were the mechanics in the Post office, the first - on the city phone automatic exchanges devices, the other - on high frequency special devices for long distance cals. Both were young men twenty-year-old and members of SKOJ.  Explosion  This group had already developed a plan of sabotage and exercised the necessary preparations during the night services. Special custom made tin boxes for explosives, they are made by locksmith Ivan Brumen, a supporter of the Communist Party and partisans resistance movement. Through resistance movements sympathizer Lieutenant of Croatian Home Guard - Augustinović, they reached amount of explosives. He purchased (and stole) the required amount of explosives from a military magazine and gave him to Mesarić. The big problem was how to bring 21 kilograms of trinitrotoluene into the building, because main Post office was under constant guard of Ustasha and Germans soldiers. The problem was solved so that they themselves sent a package, three days before the sabotage. The package was received by Slavko Markon on 12 September, who placed it in a handy magazine, near to automatic exchanges facilities. Slavko Markon, Josip Čuljat and Nada Galjer (telephone operator) were able somehow to adjust their attendance so that all three are found in service on Saturday night at pm. They began work immediately. There were seven boxes of explosives. In each of these seven boxes installed were all the necessary parts for the electrical ignition. When it was done, boxes were placed first in three of the automatic switchboards facilities and later on two long distance high frequency facilities that were on the lower floor and another in two places in the so-called splitter facility. Department of high-frequency devices was constantly guard by a German soldier with the two duty mechanics. The Nazis were very interested in this department because there were special German devices to maintain telephone links with Vienna, Berlin, Belgrade and Athens, and through them went cables from Berlin to Odessa and Sofia. It was therefore necessary to disable German soldier, because in his presence they could not mount the explosive devices. Problem with a soldier they resolved so that he drank a good bottle of brandy that was brought by Čuljat, then he slept all night dead drunk. At seven in the morning everything was prepared for the explosion. At eight in the morning Čuljat, Markon, Galjer and other participants in the organization of sabotage that had to be compromised, went by train to Karlovac to switch to Kordun and than had to Yugoslav Partisans. On Sunday at 12.30 a.m. in the apartment of Professor Olga Milčinović, Nikola Rupčić which given the task from Anton Biber, - raised the phone, dialed preferred number and with that activated the detonation. After the explosion a lot of police officers ran into the building, in order to prevent a possible second explosion. They issued a command to disconnect all of the building from electrical power, even from the reserve power battery pack. In this way they caused another explosion. Due to an error during installation, one of the seven explosive devices did not explode. Sabotage caused heavy damage to the telephone facilities at the General Post Office in Zagreb, and several-hour interruption of telephone communications with Vienna, Berlin, Belgrade, Odessa and Sofia. Telephone facilities were repaired in almost seven months. On the site, police clerk was killed, while the five agents of the Ustasha, two German soldiers and one German officer were wounded. None of the postal officials and civilian persons were injured.  Aftermath  Stone memorial of the event stands at the entrance into the General Post Office building. (Embossed letters are hardly visible; picture taken in 2012.) On Wednesday 17 September a warrant was issued for the perpetrators of this action, Josip Čuljat, Slavko Markon, Vilim Galjer and Nada Galjer and printed in the form of large posters in several hundred thousand copies, which were deployed in all public places in Independent State of Croatia. After the war, film director Ivo Lukas made a film about this event in 1961 entitled Diverzija na telefonsku centralu (Diversion to a telephone switchboard).

The South African government declared 33 disaster zones. Background In December 2010, a global weather pattern known as La Niña resulted in increased rainfall over Southern Africa. Similar events related to the La Niña took place in several other countries around the world, including Australia, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Pakistan and the Philippines. South Africa In South Africa more than 6,000 people have been displaced and 70 known to have been killed due to the floods. This number is expected to rise as police continue to search for an unknown number of missing persons. Eight of the country's nine provinces have been declared disaster areas, allowing for national funds to be distributed. Preliminary estimates placed crop damage at R1 billion ($145 million US$). Property damage was also estimated at $52 million. An estimated of agricultural land has been affected by the floods. The South African Air Force was brought in to aid in evacuating residents through air lifts by 15 January.

An estimated 13,000 people have been evacuated and at least 13 are known to have been killed. Fearing a repeat of the 2000 Mozambique floods, residents living along the Limpopo River began evacuating on 19 January as the river rose to its alert level. In some areas, the river has topped its banks, flooding dozens of hectares of crops. According to Chokwe district administrator Alberto Libombo, the rise in the river was mostly attributed to increased discharges at dams upstream where heavy rains fell. Elsewhere In Zimbabwe, some areas recorded their heaviest rainfall in over 30 years, leading to fears of deadly floods across the country. A flood-related bus crash killed four people and flooding in another location claimed another victim in Masvingo. The nation's Civil Protection Unit director Madzudzo Pawadyira urged that any residents living in low-lying areas evacuate to higher ground. Similarly heavy rains also affected portions of Zambia and Malawi; however, it is unknown if flooding has taken place in these areas. In southern Botswana, thousands of people are threatened by the possibility of widespread flooding that could submerge entire villages. Two rivers, the Shoshong and Mpolonyane, have already burst their banks and have inundated nearby areas. Daily activity in Shoshong and Kalamare was disrupted as residents were faced with rising flood waters, forcing schools to close. Parts of Namibia were also faced with floods, but the government is taking extreme caution due to a recent flood, three years ago, which devastated parts of the country.

His style combines elements of traditional playwrighting with aspects of performance art. Life and career Gordon, who attended New York City Public Schools and New York University, and worked as a stage electrician at Dance Theater Workshop (DTW), began writing and directing for the stage in 1985, emerging in the downtown dance/performance scene with four consecutive seasons at DTW plus performances at Movement Research, The Poetry Project, and Performance Space 122. By 1990 Gordon was recognized in the inaugural round of the National Endowment for the Arts \\"New Forms\\" initiative – funding for artists whose work defied clear classification. He then began touring to venues including the Baltimore Museum of Art, and Dance Place in Washington, DC. In 1991, Gordon entered a multi-project relationship with Soho Rep in New York City that encompassed five productions and workshops. In 1992, he began a collaboration with his father, choreographer and director David Gordon, on The Family Business, which went on to be performed in New York at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun! Festival, Dance Theater Workshop, New York Theatre Workshop and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.Stuart, Jan (April 4, 1995) \\"A Memorable Portrayal Of a Family in Turmoil\\" Newsday This production won him his first Obie Award, in 1994. In 1992, Gordon became Co-Director of the Pick Up Performance Company, which had been founded by his father in 1971 and incorporated in 1978. Gordon won his second Obie Award in 1996 for his play Wally's Ghost, which was presented at Soho Rep. In 1998, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Playwriting. It was here that he gained recognition for his abiding subject: marginalized and forgotten history, and the invisible players who inhabit that space, developing a blend of historical fact, imagined truth and complete fiction that continues to dominate his work. Gordon's next few years were spent collaborating with David Gordon on two projects - Punch and Judy Get Divorced for American Music Theater Festival at the Plays and Players Theatre in Philadelphia and the American Repertory Theater at the C.

In addition, Gordon received a commission from the Taper, and another from the Lincoln Center Institute, and had a new play workshopped at The Public Theater and Soho Rep. In 2001, Gordon returned to his roots in the Manhattan downtown scene with several productions at HERE Arts Center, DTW, and P.S. 122, including Art Life & Show-Biz, a \\"non-fiction play\\" based on the lives and careers of avant-garde actress Lola Pashalinski (Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company), Broadway actress Helen Gallagher (No, No, Nanette), and Gordon's mother, the dancer Valda Setterfield (Merce Cunningham, David Gordon), in which the three subjects appeared as themselves. The play was published in 2010 in the anthology Dramaturgy of the Real, where Robert Vorlicky referred to it as \\"an act of remembrance and memorialization, fashioned through memories ... a scrapbook filled with snapshots from the lives of three inspirational artists.\\"Vorlicky, Robert \\"\\"An Intimate Love Letter: Ain Gordon's 'Art, Life & Show-Biz'\\" in Martin, Carol (ed.)

Gordon continues to write theater that straddles the traditions of playwrighting and performance art, blending fact and fiction. Since 2005, his work has been awarded both the Multi-Arts Production Fund (MAP) Grant and the Arts Presenters Ensemble Theatre Collaborations Program grant funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Trust, with productions at the Krannert Center in Urbana, Illinois, the VSA North Fourth Arts Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 651 ARTS in Brooklyn, LexArts in Lexington, Kentucky, and DiverseWorks in Houston, Texas. In 2007, Gordon won his third Obie Award for his performance as Spalding Grey in the Off-Broadway production of Spalding Gray: Stories Left To Tell, which also toured to venues including UCLA Live, the TBA Festival at the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art in Oregon, ICA Boston - where he was an Elliot Norton Award nominee - the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia, among others. In 2008-9 Gordon collaborated with choreographer Bebe Miller on Necessary Beauty, a multi- disciplinary evening-length work co-commissioned by the Wexner Center of Ohio State University, DTW, and the Myrna Loy Center/Helena Presents in Helena, Montana. He was commissioned by the VSA North Fourth Arts Center to write The History of Asking the Wrong Question, rooted in Native American history, and developed a new two-person play, and a one-woman play, as a Core Writer of the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis.Dancehunter. \\"Ain Gordon tells a forgotten story\\" on 29-95.com\\"Ain Gordon: A Disaster Begins\\" on the DiverseWorks website The one-woman play, A Disaster Begins, is based on the events of the devastating 1900 Galveston Hurricane. The Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia commissioned Gordon to write If She Stood, about the women of the early abolitionist movement in that city, including Sarah Grimké and Sarah Mapps Douglass. The play premiered on April 26, 2013. Later in 2013, his new play, Not What Happened, about historical reenactment and its relation to actual events, was presented at a number of theatres, including the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts in Burlington, Vermont, the Krannert Center, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Born in Vallejo, California, she was part of the hippie movement before becoming an initiated disciple of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1967. In the same year, she and her husband, Shyamasundar Das, helped Mukunda Das organize the Mantra-Rock Dance, a countercultural musical event held at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco; the dance was a fundraiser for ISKCON's first center on the west coast of the US. In 1968, together with five other Hare Krishna followers, Malati flew to London to establish ISKCON's foothold in the United Kingdom. There, she helped introduce Beatles guitarist George Harrison to Gaudiya Vaishnava's philosophy and practice. In recognition of her pioneering role in ISKCON's UK missionary activities, Malati was invited as a special guest to attend the 30th anniversary of the Bhaktivedanta Manor, ISKCON's headquarters in England, donated by Harrison to the organization in 1973. In 1997, Malati helped organize the ISKCON Women's Ministry, which paved the way for the provision of \\"equal facilities, full encouragement, and genuine care and protection for the women members of ISKCON.\\" In 1998, despite fierce opposition, Malati became the first female member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON.  Early years  Melanie Lee Nagel was born on August 30, 1945, in Vallejo, California. After graduating, in 1963, from El Camino Fundamental High School in Sacramento, California, Nagel attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. She dropped out before graduating and joined the counterculture movement of the 1960s. After her boyfriend, Sam Speerstra, got a position with the US Forest Service, she lived with him in a remote lookout tower near Bend, Oregon, where their job was to spot forest fires and report them to the National Park Service.  Hare Krishna temple in San Francisco  The Mantra- Rock Dance poster by Harvey W. Cohen (created December 1966) In 1966, Speerstra's old friend from Reed College Michael Grant became one of the first Hare Krishna followers in the United States and was given the name Mukunda Das. A surprise visit in October 1966 by Mukunda and his wife Janaki Dasi inspired Speerstra and Nagel to start following Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings and spiritual practices. Speerstra and Nagel convinced Mukunda to postpone his planned trip to India in order to try to open a Hare Krishna temple in San Francisco, and offered their assistance. When Mukunda agreed, Speerstra and Nagel moved to San Francisco and helped rent a storefront in the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, which at that time was becoming the hub of hippie counterculture. Subsequently, Mukunda, Speerstra, and Nagel converted the storefront into the first Hare Krishna temple on the west coast of the US. In order to raise funds, win supporters for the new temple, and popularize Prabhupada's teachings among the hippie and countercultural audience of the Haight-Ashbury scene, Mukunda, Speerstra, and Nagel decided to hold a charitable Mantra-Rock Dance concert at the Avalon Ballroom and invited Prabhupada to attend. Using his acquaintance with Rock Scully, manager of the Grateful Dead, and Sam Andrew, founding member and guitarist of the Big Brother and the Holding Company – who were among the most prominent rock groups in the United States at the time – Speerstra secured their consent to perform at the concert, charging only the \\"musicians’ union minimum\\" of $250. Preparing for the event, Nagel happened to hear Moby Grape, a relatively unknown group at the time, and convinced the other team members to invite the band to play at the concert as well. Her initiative later proved pivotal for Moby Grape, catapulting the band onto the professional stage, with subsequent gigs with The Doors at the Avalon Ballroom and at the \\"First Love Circus\\" at the Winterland Arena, and a contract with Columbia Records. After Prabhupada arrived in San Francisco, he gave Sam and Melanie initiations and the names Shyamasundara Das Adhikari and Malati Devi Dasi. Malati Dasi became more active in the new temple activities, primarily in shopping, collecting donations of bulk produce, and cooking for what came to be wildly popular with the local hippie community as the \\"love feasts\\", or free distribution of prasad, opulent vegetarian food sanctified by being offered to Krishna. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada chanting in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, with the deity of Jagannath to his right. Malati is also credited for her role in introducing the worship of Jagannath, a form of Krishna, in ISKCON. Prabhupada's official biographer Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami describes the incident that happened in 1967 in San Francisco: > One day Malati hurried into Prabhupada's apartment, took a small item out of > her shopping bag, and placed it on Prabhupada's desk for his inspection. > \\"What is this, Swamiji?\\" Shrila Prabhupada looked down and beheld a three- > inch wooden doll with a flat head, a black, smiling face, and big, round > eyes. The figure had stubby, forward-jutting arms, and a simple green and > yellow torso with no visible feet. Shrila Prabhupada immediately folded his > palms and bowed his head, offering the little figure respects.< \\"You have > brought Lord Jagannatha, the Lord of the universe,\\" he said, smiling and > bright-eyed. \\"He is Krsna. Thank you very much.\\" Shrila Prabhupada beamed > with pleasure, while Malati and others sat amazed at their good fortune of > seeing Swamiji so pleased. Prabhupada explained that this was Lord > Jagannatha, a Deity of Krsna worshiped all over India for thousands of > years. Jagannatha, he said, is worshiped along with two other deities: His > brother, Balarama, and His sister, Subhadra. Excitedly, Malati confirmed > that there were other, similar figures at Cost Plus, the import store where > she had found the little Jagannatha, and Shrila Prabhupada said she should > go back and buy them. Malati told her husband, Shyamasundara, and together > they hurried back and bought the two other dolls in the set. After acquiring a full set of Jagannath figures, Prabhupada asked Shyamasundara, an expert carpenter, to carve large replicas and then inaugurated their worship in the San Francisco temple, naming it \\"New Jagannatha Puri\\". Small duplicates of these deities immediately became a \\"psychedelic hit\\" and were worn by many hippies on strings around their necks.  Preaching in England  Malati Dasi helped introduce George Harrison to the spiritual practices of Gaudiya Vaishnavism (pictured performing japa, or chanting Hare Krishna on beads). Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh, India), 1996 In 1968, Malati and Shyamasundara, along with their infant daughter Saraswati, joined two other Hare Krishna couples – Mukunda and Janaki, and Gurudas and Yamuna – on a missionary trip to London in a bid to establish for ISKCON a foothold in England. After arriving in London, the team endured many months of financial insecurity and inadequate living conditions while maintaining their missionary activities including public kirtans, the distribution of promotional leaflets, and the cultivation of members of the local community. They eventually settled in a warehouse complex in Covent Garden. Speaking in 2001 at the 30th anniversary of the Bhaktivedanta Manor, ISKCON's headquarters in England, where she was a special guest in recognition of her pioneering role in establishing ISKCON in the UK, Malati recalled: > There were indeed many special memories, but actually we should not forget > something which wasn't so funny. Most of the time in the early days it was > very hard: often we would go hungry. [We had] hardly any possessions, no > money, no protection. It often got very cold. We had nothing. All we had was > love for Shrila Prabhupada. To gain a wider recognition for their movement, Shyamasundara had the idea of meeting the Beatles in order to inspire them to introduce the Hare Krishna mantra into their songs. Malati recalled, \\"We chanted and got arrested in front of the Apple Studio. We ultimately got their attention by making and sending in apple pies to the studio.\\" Malati and Shyamasundara once sent into the studio a wind up apple holding a \\"Hare Krishna\\" flag. Things changed for the group when Shyamasundara finally met and befriended George Harrison, whom Malati found \\"receptive and very spiritual\\" and helped introduce to the Hare Krishna philosophy and practice. The two families became so close that Shyamasundara and Malati lived with Harrison and his wife, Patti Boyd, for some time. Inspired by the Vaishnava teachings and lifestyle, Harrison produced two singles – \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" and \\"Govinda\\" – performed by the Hare Krishna devotees from the Radha Krishna Temple in London. Malati participated in both recordings, singing and playing the hand cymbals. Released on Apple Records, \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and significantly boosted ISKCON's popularity in England and worldwide, with the devotees appearing on Top of the Pops. Harrison also helped the devotees rent a building in London's Bury Place near the British Museum for their first Hare Krishna temple, and, in 1973, donated a estate, which was named \\"Bhaktivedanta Manor\\" and became ISKCON's headquarters in England.  Governing Body Commissioner  Prabhupada on a morning walk in Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh, India) in 1975. ISKCON's founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada openly appreciated, encouraged, and supported his female disciples in their diverse roles within ISKCON – females led kirtans, gave public classes and public lectures, managed temples, served as priests, went as missionaries to \\"ISKCON's unchartered territories,\\" headed his Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, and personally served him as secretaries, cooks, and photographers. He even recommended two women to be named founding members of ISKCON's highest international ecclesiastical and managerial body, the Governing Body Commission (GBC). Prabhupada defended the active involvement of his female followers in ISKCON's spiritual and managerial activities from critics, which included some traditional Gaudiya Matha members and other orthodox followers of Hinduism in India. Towards the end of the 1970s, however, the growth in number and influence of sannyasis (male lifelong celibates) in ISKCON's spiritual and managerial affairs led to greater male domination of the organization, and the consequent segregation, disempowerment, and denigration of women, who were denied access to prominent roles in ISKCON. In the late 1980s, criticism of the treatment of women within ISKCON and the discrimination against them in the institution's key activities began to take shape in the form of printed articles and women's conventions. In the mid-1990s, Malati played a leading role in efforts to ensure equality for women in the organization and helped form ISKCON Women's Ministry in 1997, headed by Sudharma Dasi. Malati became a vocal suffragette within ISKCON, which led to her \\"fiercely debated but historic appointment\\" to the GBC in 1998. In 2000, the presence of Malati and Sudharma on the GBC led to serious discussion of women's role in the organization at the GBC's annual meeting in Mayapur (West Bengal, India), and called for \\"an apology for the mistakes of the past, recognition of the importance of women for the health of the movement, and the reinstatement of women's participatory rights.\\" The resultant resolution of the GBC acknowledged the importance of the issue and asserted the priority of providing \\"equal facilities, full encouragement, and genuine care and protection for the women members of ISKCON.\\" Malati's responsibilities, as one of the 32 GBC global secretaries, include overseeing the activities of ISKCON in Florida, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the New Vrindaban community in West Virginia, which she visits twice a year. Described as \\"soft spoken\\" and having \\"an uncommon mix of humility and charisma,\\" Malati is respected for her \\"clear understanding\\" of ISKCON's history and teachings and often counsels devotees, lectures on Gaudiya Vaishnava's philosophy and practice, and participates in inter-religious meetings.

The capital was Thorn. It was founded in the 10th century and remained independent until 1794, when it was occupied by French troops. The abbey was reichsunmittelbar and belonged to the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle. The territory covered about 1.5 square kilometers with 3400 inhabitants in 1790.  Foundation  Ansfried of Utrecht and his wife Hereswint are regarded by some sources as the founders of the Abbey of Thorn Details of the founding of the abbey are not clear. According to some sources, the abbey was founded by Countess Hilswind in 902 for herself and her daughter Beatrix. She donated the necessary land, which had been personal property, given to the Countess by King Zwentibold. Other sources claim a Benedictine double monastery was founded by Bishop Ansfried of Utrecht and his wife Hereswint in 925. A Romanesque abbey church was built in 992; some sources give this as the year the Abbey was founded.  Abbey structure  Model of the abbey district View of the south side of St. Michael's Church The community of women came only from the high nobility. It is likely that Thorn had belonged to the Benedictine order originally. It probably changed, however, in the 12th century, to a free secular ladies' abbey. In 1310, the secular canons of the Abbey stressed their secular status and they claimed to never have been Benedictine. In the 18th century, collegiate ladies were, in principle, required to reside in the Abbey all year, except for at most six weeks per year. However, for 600 florins, ladies could buy themselves free. In theory, free ladies were still required to provide six weeks of choral service; this was not always observed in practice. Some ladies held positions in several abbeys. This possibility of buying freedom appears to have been used frequently. Maria Josepha of Hatzfeld and Gleichen, for example, was a member of the abbeys at Thorn and Essen for 46 years. During this time, she resided in Essen Abbey for four years, but never in Thorn. The abbey district contained a curia building for the Deachoness and five house for the ladies. In the 14th Century, a new Gothic Abbey Church was built. Some of the ladies built houses outside the abbey district.  History  The imperial immediacy of the abbey was confirmed in 1292 by King Adolf of Nassau. Under Emperor Maximilian I, the abbey was under the special imperial protection. In the imperial matriculation register at Worms, the Abbey was recorded as a reichsunmittelbar area. The matriculation duties, however, were transferred to the Counts of Lippe. The abbey was a member the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle and the Rhenish College of Imperial Prelates. In the 17th century the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands sought to restrict the imperial immediacy. The abesses resisted these attempts successfully. In the 18th century, the abbess held the title of Princess. Several abbesses were simultaneously head of Essen Abbey. The territory was conquered by French troops in 1794 and formally annexed by France in 1795. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna awarded the territory to the Kingdom of the United Netherlands.

The house of Roquefeuil-Anduze was formed in 1129 after the union between Adelaïs of Roquefeuil and Bernard of Anduze. Heiress of the first Roquefeuil family, Adelaïs inherited from his father and transmitted her family possessions to her son Raymond. Both the Roquefeuil and Anduze family controlled vast territories in the Languedoc, France under various noble titles and coined money. There is no evidence or presumption that the name would, as some would allege, have been Germanized into \\"Rockefeller\\" or \\"Rockenfeld\\".  Origin of the Roquefeuil family  The Roquefeuil family appeared in 900 as an offshoot of the house of Barcelona and became one of the most illustrious noble families in the south of France. The possessions in the Languedoc, France included the barony of Roquefeuil-Meyrueis or the viscounty of Creyssels. Some ruins of the Roquefeuil castle still exits in Saint-Jean du Bruel (formerly Saint-Jean of Roquefeuil).  Roquefeuil-Anduze  In 1129, Bertrand of Anduze married the heiress Adélaïde of Roquefeuil. Their son Raymond maintained the name of Roquefeuil and inherited from his mother creating the House of Roquefeuil-Anduze. He and his descendants fought in the wars of the Middle Ages: the Cathar Crusade, Seventh Crusade and the Hundred Years War. * Raymond I of Roquefeuil, son of Bertrand of Anduze and Adelaïde of Roquefeuil married Guillemette of Montpellier. She was the daughter of Guilhem VII and Mathilde of Bourgogne. They gave birth to: ** Raymond II of Roquefeuil who took part in the Fourth Council of the Lateran. With his wife Dauphine de Turenne he had at least one daughter: Isabeau of Roquefeuil who married in 1230 Hugues IV of Rodez. He also took part in the Seventh Crusade and his coat of arms were painted at Versailles in the Hall of Crusades. ** Arnaud I of Roquefeuil who later succeeded to his brother as head of household. He married in 1228 Beatrix of Anduze with whom he had six legitimate children. He also gave birth to Guillaume or William who was legitimated in 1263 by the king of Aragon and formed the Roquefeuil-Versol branch. *** Raymond III of Roquefeuil married in 1259 Alazie du Tournel who gave him ten children. **** Raymond IV of Roquefeuil married in 1287 Vaurie of Hébrail. ***** Arnaud II of Roquefeuil served the king John II of France during his campaigns in Agenais, was named seneschal of Périgord in 1360 and later ambassador. He was known for the war he won and declared to the king James II of Majorca who previously killed his eldest son Bernard.

Life The son of William Weston, of Lincoln College, Oxford and afterwards a member of Lincoln's Inn, by his wife, daughter of John Story, he was born in London in 1566. Hugh Weston was his great-uncle. Edward matriculated at Lincoln College on 20 March 1579. Afterwards he was put under the tuition of John Case. After he had spent at least five years at Oxford, his parents, who were Catholics, took him from the university and sent him to France, where for a short time he settled in the English College at Reims. He was sent on 8 March 1585 to the English College, Rome, where he spent six years in studying philosophy and theology, and was ordained priest. He was created D.D. by the university of Monreale. Then he returned to Reims, where, on 3 November 1592, he began a course of lectures on cases of conscience. In 1593 the college moved to Douai, where Weston lectured in divinity for about ten years. Later he went on mission in England, returning to Douai on 23 September 1612. He maintained a correspondence with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, who held similar political views. He was dismissed from Douai in 1617 by Matthew Kellison. Later he was made canon of the collegiate church of St. Mary, Bruges, where, according to Hippolyte-Romain-Joseph Duthillœul, he died in 1635.

Integrated cleaning rod on a Mauser M59. A cleaning cord with a clip at the end for attaching a patch. Historical bore cleaning equipment for a cannon. A cleaning rod is a firearm maintenance tool that can be used to clean the inside (bore) of a gun's barrel, and is made in different sizes for use on different barrel lengths, calibers and gauges. It is a sturdy, long, thin, straight rod typically made of metal, rigid plastic or carbon fiber, and usually has a handle at one end for gripping and threadings at the other end for attaching cleaning accessories. It is used to push brushes, mops and cotton patches through the bore to deliver solvents and scrub away foulings, or to physically remove any obstructing objects such as a squib load. Commonly, a breech-end extension tube, known as a bore guide or rod guide, is also used in conjunction with the cleaning rod to prevent cleaning solvent from spilling out into the receiver, and to keep the rod supported and centered inside the bore in order to minimize potential damage to riflings. Similarly, a muzzle guide or muzzle guard might be used if the cleaning rod is to be inserted from the muzzle end of the firearm in order to protect the crown of the muzzle from mechanical damage. A cleaning cord, also known as a \\"bore snake\\", is an alternative gun care tool to a cleaning rod. A bore snake is a flexible fabric cord with a tapered thin end that has a weight attached to it, in order to help the initial feeding of the cord through the breech end of the barrel. When the thin end has been fed throughout the other end, the rest of the cord is then dragged towards the muzzle, scrubbing the bore along the way. A bore snake often has one or more integrated brushes to help clear away more stubborn contaminants, and may also be used to apply lubricants.

It was produced in 1970, directed by Gilles Grangier and broadcast in 1971. The series starred the German actor Amadeus August as the protagonist and the French actress Marie-France Boyer as Isabelle de Croye. The series was based on Sir Walter Scott's in 1823 published novel Quentin Durward. It concerns a Scottish soldier who serves French King Louis XI (1423-1483) while the King has to overcome the schemes of his rival Charles the Bold and Jean Balue. The TV series kept close to the classic novel and was often shot at historic French locations. The French version consists of 7 instalments of 52 minutes each, while the dubbed German version had 13 episodes of about 25 minutes apiece. Both versions have been made available on DVD.  Storyline  In a monastery in Scotland on the day of an ordination to the priesthood, Quentin Durward, a dashing young man of noble background, is about to be consecrated. The monks beseech him to devote his life to God in order to save his life. He is reminded that he would have been dead already if it hadn't been for the monks and their solemn promise to make him one of them. By listening to the monks while they are berating young Quentin, the audience learns that Quentin's clan has been wiped out as the result of a feud. The hostile clan who killed Quentin's kin is determined to put an end to the bloodline one way or the other. Either he takes the oath to live in celibacy or he won't be spared any longer after all. While they raid the monastery he manages to escape his pursuers and to reach the English Channel. He heads for France because his only living relative, his uncle Lludovic Cunningham (played by Noël Roquevert), serves as a member of the Scottish Guard. At the same time Isabelle de Croye, who is also an orphan, secretly leaves the Kingdom of Burgundy in order to elude an arranged marriage and find shelter in France too. They run into each other, fall in love and after many adventures they marry in the Abbey Notre Dame of Morienval.

Life He was a younger son of John Warren of Otterford, Somerset. He was educated at Crewkerne grammar school, and St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 3 July 1658. At the Restoration of 1660 he left Oxford with his tutor. After a year at Reading he returned to Otterford, and began to preach. He held no living, but was silenced by the Uniformity Act 1662. After this he employed himself as a tutor—Warren was one of the first nonconformists who trained students for the ministry. The date at which he began this work was not later than 1671, when John Shower entered with him. Among his early pupils was Christopher Taylor (died 26 October 1723), in whose ordination at Lyme Regis, Dorset, he took part on 25 August 1687. By this time he had moved to Taunton, where, with Emanuel Hartford (died 4 August 1706, aged 65), he founded a dissenting congregation under the declaration for liberty of conscience (1687). At Taunton he continued his academy; his most distinguished pupil was Henry Grove. Warren encouraged his students to read modern books and promoted biblical criticism. He was successful in his congregation at Paul's meeting; originally presbyterian, but it became congregationalist. He died at Taunton on 14 June 1706. His funeral sermon was preached by John Sprint of Milbournport. He was married and left children. Christopher Taylor wrote a Latin epitaph for him.

Ambrosetti Museum of Ethnography is an Argentine museum maintained by the University of Buenos Aires School of Philosophy and Letters and located in Buenos Aires. Overview An estate on an eight-hectare (20 acre) property in Buenos Aires' Nueva Pompeya ward became the site of a homemade museum in 1866, when 14-year-old Francisco Moreno and his father classified and mounted their extensive collection of fossils and artifacts, gathered in excursions along the property and surroundings. The younger Moreno organized his collection as a public display, and with funding from the Province of Buenos Aires, inaugurated the Anthropology and Ethnography Museum of Buenos Aires in 1879.Museo Etnográfico Ambrosetti: Historia Moai Kavakava, from Easter Island. Bow and tools of the Selknam People (Tierra del Fuego) Featuring over 15,000 artifacts, the collection was ultimately transferred to the new La Plata Museum in 1888. Explorations in the Gran Chaco region conducted at the time by University of Buenos Aires naturalist Juan Bautista Ambrosetti led to an extensive, new collection, however, and in 1904, the latter inaugurated the University of Buenos Aires Museum of Ethnography. The museum became the first in Argentina to introduce guided excursions for its patrons, and travels along the Inca road system resulted in the 1908 discovery of Pucará de Tilcara, among the best-preserved ruins of settlements by Pre-Inca cultures in the area. Elaborate petroglyphs and over 3,000 other relics were recovered and catalogued in the following three years, and most were added to the collections of the Museum of Ethnography. The settlement itself was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.UNESCO World Heritage Dr. Ambrosetti died in 1917, and its management was continued by his collaborators, Drs. Salvador Debenedetti and Félix Outes. The museum was relocated to its present location in the city's Montserrat ward in 1927; the Italianate structure had been designed by Pedro Benoit for the School of Law, and completed in 1878. Many of the collections of archeology and anthropology of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum were assigned to this museum in the decade of 1940, despite this, the institution became largely overshadowed. It was bolstered, however, by the 1958 creation of a Degree in Anthropology by the University of Buenos Aires, and the institution was subsequently transferred to the university's School of Philosophy and Letters.

He later earned a degree in English from University College London. Following his graduation, O'Connor successfully applied for a place on ITV's Regional Theatre Young Directors’ Scheme. Film O'Connor produced the feature film version of Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea directed by Terence Davies and starring Rachel Weisz, Tom Hiddleston and Simon Russell Beale.

On 18 February 2016, it was announced that O'Connor would return to EastEnders after 11 years and take over from Dominic Treadwell-Collins as Executive Producer. On his return he commented \\"I'm thrilled to be back in Walford and particularly delighted to work once more with many dear friends and colleagues both backstage and on screen. I loved my time working at EastEnders previously; there's nothing quite as challenging nor as rewarding.\\" Following this, he announced he would be stepping down from The Archers, saying \\"At the same time, it is a real wrench for me to leave Ambridge. The Archers is an extraordinary programme – a jewel at the heart of the BBC and in the hearts of the British public. Working on it, with the extraordinary cast, writers and production team in Birmingham has been an absolute privilege. The Archers has been a part of my life for much of my life - and though I’ll be away from Borsetshire, I'll continue to listen to the villagers of Ambridge, who feel to me – as they do for millions of listeners - like family.\\" O'Connor's first episode as Executive Producer aired on 11 July 2016. Although O'Connor's first credited episode aired in July, his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. On 23 June 2017, it was announced that O'Connor would be leaving EastEnders after a year in the role of executive producer. O'Connor said: \\"I've had an amazing time at EastEnders. Working with the editorial staff, cast and crew at Elstree has been an absolute privilege. They are the kindest, most loyal and hard-working team in the business. But my heart lies in feature films and I'm hugely excited as my film projects are now reaching production. I'll enjoy watching EastEnders go from strength to strength but will miss everybody enormously. Elstree really is a place where you make friends for life.\\" O'Connor's final episode as Executive Producer aired on 24 November 2017. Directing As a graduate of the Regional Theatre Young Directors' Scheme,http://www.itvtheatredirectorscheme.org/pasttraineeslist.php O'Connor has worked all over the UK as a theatre director. His work has featured at Liverpool Everyman, Hornchurch, Salisbury Playhouse, Chester Gateway, Windsor, Guilford, Bath, Richmond, Chichester, Cardiff and Edinburgh. In 1995, O'Connor directed the UK premiere of Dorothy Parker's drama, The Ladies of the Corridor (1953) at the Finborough Theatre and the first London revival of Christa Winsloe's Children in Uniform (1931) (Madchen in Uniform) at Battersea Arts Centre.

In 1997, he published Straight Acting; Popular Gay Drama from Wilde to Rattigan, examining the work of British gay playwrights who dominated the West End in the 20th Century. Dartmouth's Professor of Gender Studies, Michael Bronski, praised the book, claiming that it \\"almost single-handedly reinvents what we think of as the history of modern gay theater\\".Straight-Acting: Popular Gay Dramatists from Wilde to Rattigan (Lesbian & gay studies): Sean O'Connor: 9780304328642: Amazon.com: Books The same year, he adapted and directed the play Vertigo based on the novel D'Entre Les Morts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, which was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's film of 1958. This, the first stage adaptation of the story, retained the original French wartime setting of the novel. The play first appeared at Chester Gateway Theatre featuring Marcus D'Amico, but was subsequently produced by Bill Kenwright at the Theatre Royal Windsor starring Martin Shaw and Jenny Seagrove. A revival at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford starred Anthony Andrews in the central role, replacing Martin Shaw. In 2001, O'Connor adapted Winston Graham's 1960 novel Marnie for the stage which played at Chester Gateway Theatre and The Haymarket Theatre, Basingstoke. The adaptation returned the story to Graham's original post-war British setting and preserved Graham's bleak ending. In 2010, O'Connor adapted Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as Juliet and Her Romeo which played at Bristol Old Vic, directed by Tom Morris and starring Siân Phillips, Michael Byrne and Dudley Sutton. The sensational murder trial of Alma Rattenbury provides the subject for O'Connor's 2019 non-fiction work The Fatal Passion of Alma Rattenbury .

He was a British consul in Ottoman Syria, and he created the first political plan for Zionism and the creation of the state of Israel in the region of Ottoman Palestine.Lucien Wolf, Notes on the Diplomatic History of the Jewish Question with texts of protocols, treaty stipulations and other public acts and official documents, Jewish Historical Society of England, 1919, p. 119. British Consul in Ottoman Syria In the early 1840s, as British consul in Damascus responsible for Ottoman Syria (including today's Palestine) under Lord Palmerston's Foreign Office, he proposed the first political plan to create a Jewish State (Israel) in Palestine. The proposal correspondence with Sir Moses Montefiore, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, in which Churchill proposed a strategy for the creating of a Jewish state, pre-dating formal Zionism by approximately half a century. The correspondence came in the wake of the Oriental Crisis of 1840, the Damascus affair of 1840 and the acceleration of the Eastern Question by the successful European-backed Greek War of Independence which had concluded ten years earlier. On 14 June 1841, Churchill wrote to Montefiore: > I cannot conceal from you my most anxious desire to see your countrymen > endeavour once more to resume their existence as a people. I consider the > object to be perfectly attainable. But, two things are indispensably > necessary. Firstly, that the Jews will themselves take up the matter > universally and unanimously. Secondly, that the European Powers will aid > them in their views. It is for the Jews to make a commencement.

Its main role is the handling of tourist traffic in the Harz and the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways there, but it is also worked by goods trains to and from the rolling mills in Ilsenburg. The line originally ran from Ilsenburg further south towards Bad Harzburg. This section was cut, however, by the division of Germany in 1945. In 1996 a new section of line was built from Ilsenburg towards Vienenburg, that used parts of the previously closed Halberstadt–Vienenburg railway. At the same time the railway was upgraded to handle speeds of up to 120 km/h. The line has since acted as a direct link between Halberstadt and Vienenburg.  History  = To 1945 = Wernigerode station Vienenburg station There had been a direct link between Halberstadt, Heudeber-Danstedt and Vienenburg since 1869. This took the shortest distance, but missed out the densely populated Harz Foreland and towns like Wernigerode and Ilsenburg. The spa town of Wernigerode, already important, was able to persuade Berlin, that the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company was obliged to deliver a roughly nine kilometre long branch line from Heudeber-Danstedt. This was opened on 11 May 1872. This was following by growing demands from Ilsenburg with its burgeoning iron and steel industry. There were long negotiations about a rail link from Wernigerode via Ilsenburg to Bad Harzburg with a possible extension to Goslar, which was not considered commercially viable according to estimates at that time. In the end, the Prussian state railways had the line built and, on 20 May 1884, Ilsenburg and Wernigerode were linked to one another. As the line was only of regional importance a winding route was accepted. Questionmarks over the planned route and the resistance of landowners further delayed the construction of the section to Bad Harzburg. It was not until 1 October 1894 that services called here, going via Stapelburg and Eckertal. From the outset there were through passenger trains from Bad Harzburg to Halberstadt. Even if this link mainly served the local region, there was a number of long-distance trains, including in the 1930s by going through coaches from Hamburg via Wernigerode to Berlin. = Division in 1945 = Although the line had suffered no heavy damage during the war, upon the division of Germany in 1945 it was cut on the border between the zones of occupation between Stapelburg and Eckertal. The Deutsche Bundesbahn discontinued passenger services to Eckertal in 1958. In 1961 the Deutsche Reichsbahn cut public services back from Stapelburg, which was in the border area, to Ilsenburg. The line did remain open as a military branch however. = Reconnexion in 1996 = In December 1989 in the euphoria after the fall of the Berlin Wall the section from Ilsenburg to Stapelburg was reopened. In the years that followed there was and intensive debate about reconnecting lines between Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt in the North Harz region. It was soon clear that the federal government and the railway authorities only wanted to fund one link at the time. The old goods line was however unsuitable for regional services, the inclines near and Bad Harzburg and the change of running direction there were major drawbacks for goods traffic. As a result, it was decided to create a new route that started in front of Stapelburg on the line from Ilsenburg and rejoined the line to Vienenburg in Saxony-Anhalt. That also meant that the construction work in Lower Saxony could be viewed by the planning authorities as the renovation of an existing line which enabled the installation of level crossings On 12 April 1995 the Ilsenburg–Stapelburg line was closed again and, on 2 June 1996, the new link was taken into service. Stapelburg was given a railway connexion for the third time with a new halt. The line was initially worked by Interregio trains, but they soon disappeared again. In 2007 the line was closed for trackworks; it was given new electronic signal boxes and was equipped for the trains using tilting technology. In December 2007 it was open again from end to end. As part of the upgrade almost all the old signal boxes were torn down, including the one that was a protected monument at Ströbeck station. The conservation authorities filed charges and the Deutsche Bahn were not able to reach a resolution with them.  2010 operations  The current operating concept envisages fast passenger trains running between Halle and Hanover (the HarzExpress) and local trains operated by (HEX) stopping at all stations, both at two-hourly intervals. The line is part of the North Harz Network (Nordharznetz). At weekends the Harz Berlin Express links the Harz with Berlin. Since the 2008 timetable change journey times have reduced as a result of the completion of construction work.Nordharzstrecke für den Neigetechnikverkehr freigegeben In addition steel is moved between the factories in Salzgitter and Ilsenburg.

The family is chiefly remembered for developing the village of Johnstown. He was born in London, eldest son of James Hely. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1670 and was called to the Bar in 1679. Marriage In 1685 he made a seemingly advantageous marriage to Meliora Gorges, younger daughter of the merchant Ferdinando Gorges of Eye Manor, Hertfordshire, and his wife Meliora Hilliard. Gorges had supposedly made a fortune in Barbados, although there were many who claimed that he was simply a financial schemer or confidence trickster whose fortune was largely imaginary, and he was already in serious financial difficulties by 1685. Hely and Meliora had at least five children: their eldest son, George, was the founder of the Hely family of Foulkscourt Castle, Johnstown, County Kilkenny.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland James Moore Dublin 1839 Vol.6 p.62 They had at least two other sons, John and James: James was still a minor in 1717, when the three brothers were involved in a lawsuit against their uncle Henry Gorges.Hely v Gorges (1717) National Archives C11/1396/19 Eye Manor, which was built by Hely's father-in-law, Ferdinando Gorges. =The Coningsby connection= Meliora's elder sister Barbara had married the rising young statesman Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby in 1675. Barbara's marriage to Thomas was notoriously unhappy, largely due to her father's ill-advised financial schemes which involved Thomas in disastrous losses, and ended in divorce. Nonetheless Hely's rise to high office was almost certainly due to the Coningsby connection:Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray, London, 1926 Vol. 2 p.57 Coningsby's biographer suggests that Hely was sent to Ireland to strengthen Coningsby's power base in Dublin.Rogers, Pat The Life and Times of Thomas, Lord Coningsby Continuum International Publishing Group 2011 p.54 Judicial career He was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1690 on the recommendation of Coningsby, who had been appointed one of the Lord Justices (Ireland), which gave him a considerable degree of control over the Irish administration. Hely arrived in Ireland the following year, joined the King's InnsKenny, Colum King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.204 and was knighted in 1692. He held the office of Commissioner of Revenue Appeals at the same time. He lived at Stephen Street in Dublin city and had a country house at Ballygall near Finglas in west County Dublin. Either Sir John, or his eldest son George Hely of Foulkscourt Castle, began laying out the village of Johnstown in County Kilkenny. He was a member of the Dublin Philosophical Society. Johnstown, County Kilkenny, which was developed by the Hely family. In 1695 Hely became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. He acted as Speaker of the Irish House of Lords in 1696-7. Death Within a few years, despite his relative youth, his health failed. In 1701, although he felt well enough to travel on the spring assizes, he fell ill at Ennis and died \\"after two days sickness\\" at the house of Mr David England, who was later paid £3 by the Crown for caring for him. Burke suggests that Hely, like many judges of the time, found that the strain of going on assize (in particular enduring the ordeal of the notoriously bad Irish roads) was too much for his constitution to bear.Burke, Oliver Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit Dublin Hodges Figgis and Co 1885 p.70 About 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher John Dunton, on a visit to Dublin, gave a sketch of the Irish judiciary and praised most of them, including Hely, as \\"men of such reputation that no one complains of them\\".

Early life  Sweeney was born in Superior, Washtenaw Co., MI, on July 27, 1851, to William Jacob and Aurilla (Day) Sweeney. He was married twice. He was first married to Rene Clark, with whom he had two children; and then second to Roberta Lomax Erskine. He died in 1921. Sweeney was primarily known as a newspaper man. His career began in 1879. He contributed to both black and to white newspapers; an example of the latter is The Herald, in Indianapolis. He edited and published The People (Wheeling West Virginia, 1885–6), The National People (Detroit, 1886–7); was editor and manager of The Freeman (Indianapolis, 1890–8); and editor and part owner, Chicago Leader (1905–6). At The Freeman, Sweeney was associated with R. W. Thompson, who would later suggest to Booker T. Washington that Sweeney's work at The Chicago Conservator receive a subsidy from Washington to support its continued publication.Booker T. Washington, Louis R. Harlan, The Booker T. Washington Papers: 1899-1900, University of Illinois Press, 1976, p. 209. Sweeney's most famous newspaper association was as editor of the Chicago Conservator. The Conservator was in the center of a political power struggle whose sides were associated with W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington. Sweeney was in the Washington camp and became editor of the Conservator in 1904. Sweeney exhibited some ineptness as a manager and businessman while there, as he often missed publication dates for considerable periods of a time. As a poet, Sweeney was considered to be one of the \\"Chicago poets\\" and thought to have written the first poem by a black man employing the technique of free verse.

Life He was born at Taunton, Somerset, on 4 January 1684. His grandfather was the ejected vicar of Pinhoe, Devon, whose son, a Taunton upholsterer, married a sister of John Rowe, ejected from a lectureship at Westminster Abbey; Henry was the youngest of fourteen children, most of whom died young. Grounded in classics at the Taunton grammar school, he proceeded at the age of fourteen (1698) to the Taunton dissenting academy. Here he went through a course of philosophy and divinity under Matthew Warren. The text-books were David Derodon, Franco Burgersdyck, and Eustachius de Saint-Paul; Grove devoted himself to Jean Leclerc, Richard Cumberland, and John Locke. In 1703, he moved to London to study under his cousin Thomas Rowe, in whose academy he remained two years. Rowe was a Cartesian; Grove became a disciple of Isaac Newton. He studied Hebrew, and formed his style of preaching on Richard Lucas and John Howe. With Isaac Watts he began a close friendship, which survived many differences of opinion. In 1705 Grove returned to Somerset, where his preaching attracted attention. He married, and probably settled for a short time at Ilchester. Warren died on 14 June 1706. The Somerset presbyterians met to arrange for carrying on the Taunton Academy, and appointed Grove, in his twenty-third year, tutor in ethics and pneumatology. He lived at Taunton, and took charge of the neighbouring congregations of Hull Bishop's and West Hatch, with James Strong. The resignation of Darch, his colleague at the academy, threw on him the conduct of the departments of mathematics and physics. Early in 1725 Stephen James, the divinity tutor, died, and Grove, without relinquishing his other work, took his place, with the assistance of his nephew, Thomas Amory. He resigned his congregations to succeed James as minister at Fullwood (or Pitminster), near Taunton. He declined invitations to Exeter and London. He refused to take any share in the doctrinal disputes which spread from Exeter to London in 1719, and produced the rupture at Salters' Hall. His orthodoxy was called in question by John Ball, especially because of his discourse on saving faith (1736); but though he laid great stress on the reasonableness of Christianity, and on the moral argument for a future state, he avoided speculations on the doctrine of the Trinity. The Taunton Academy sustained its reputation during his tutorship. A list of ninety-three of his students is given by James Manning;Monthly Repository, 1818, p. 89 sq. twenty-two extra names are given in Joshua Toulmin's manuscript list. Grove preached on 19 February 1738, and was seized the same night with a violent fever, of which he died on 27 February. He was buried at Taunton, where there is a tablet to his memory in Paul's Meeting, bearing a Latin inscription from the pen of John Ward of Gresham College. James Strong of Ilminster and William May of London preached funeral sermons. His wife died insane in 1736; he had thirteen children, of whom five survived him. Works He took care over his sermons, and systematised his lectures on metaphysics and ethics; his ethical system (published posthumously and in an unfinished state) was his favourite work. His first publication, on the \\"regulation of diversions\\" (1708), was designed to produce in his pupils the love of a high morale. He wrote hymns; his poetical flights were stimulated by the friendship of Elizabeth Singer. In 1708 he corresponded with Samuel Clarke on the defects of his argument for the existence of God. For Clarke, as a Newtonian, he had respect, but thought him inferior as a metaphysician to Andrew Baxter. In 1714 he contributed four papers to the revived issue (eighth volume) of The Spectator. Grove published (1718) an essay on the immateriality of the soul. Grove's publications included: * An Essay towards a Demonstration of the Soul's Immateriality, &c.;, 1718; has apreface on the reality of an external world against Arthur Collier. * The Evidence for our Saviour's Resurrection, 1730, commended by Lardner. * Some Thoughts concerning the Proofs of a Future State from Reason, 1730, against Joseph Hallet III. * Queries proposed to … all such as think it an injury to Religion to show the Reasonableness of it, 1732, (anon.) Posthumous were: * Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, most of them formerly published, 1739. * Sermons and Tracts, &c.;, 1740, 4 vols.; second series, 1741-2, 6 vols.; the two series reissued as Posthumous Works, 1745, 10 vols. * A System of Moral Philosophy, 1749, 2 vols., edited, and the last eight chapters written, by Amory, who edited the other posthumous works. Some of his verses were included in the continuation of John Dryden's Miscellany Poems, 1706, vol. vi., and in similar collections. His letters on free will and immortality and in defence of the Presbyterians (against John Trenchard) appeared in the 'St. James's Journal,' 1722. His last Spectator was included by Bishop Edmund Gibson in his edition (1731) of Joseph Addison's Evidences of the Christian Religion. At the time of his death Grove was writing the life of Elizabeth Rowe. The lists of subscribers to his posthumous works include the names of Archbishop Thomas Herring, with Hoadly, Secker, and Hutton among the bishops.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie Année (1990) Volume 8 Numéro 8 p. 117–118 edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Early career Yvon was born in Mamers, Maine on the border with Normandy on 15 April 1714. Nothing is known about his early life, except that he received holy orders before moving to Paris. There he made a poor living as a teacher at the Sorbonne, preparing students for their exams, and wrote several anonymous works. His first work published under his own name were articles in the Encyclopédie on Ame (Soul), Atheé (Atheism), Dieu (God) and several others. In these articles, Yvon gives many arguments in favour of the soul and of God, but proposes that the best arguments are the natural or philosophical ones. The apparently harmless articles attracted the attention of the official controllers of the philosophical press, who notified the advocate-general, Omer Joly de Fleury. Joly de Fleury wrote a violent indictment of the articles, particularly that on the Soul, which he said was infected with atheism. Voltaire responded by saying the article was one of the worst in the book, but that contrary to the accusation it was far from supporting materialism but in fact made every effort to oppose materialism. However, in the eyes of the church Yvon, by appealing to rationalist arguments, was in effect an atheist. Later career Yvon was suspected of contributing to a controversial thesis published in 1752 by Jean-Martin de Prades, and fled to Holland to avoid the storm. While there, he was employed by the publisher Marc-Michel Rey as a corrector. The records of an Amsterdam masonic lodge record him speaking on the virtues of the philosopher. In The third volume of the Encyclopédie noted that \\"M. l'abbé Yvon ... est absent\\". However, his unsigned articles continued to appear in the Encyclopédie. From the Dutch Republic he did not move to Berlin as stated in some articles, , but to Liège, where he assisted Pierre Rousseau in producing the Journal Encyclopédique. However, the articles of this periodical were not appreciated by the clergy of Liège, and Rousseau and Yvon both fled the country in September 1759. They were invited to Brussels by the count Charles de Cobenz, the minister of the Austrian State in Brussels. When Rousseau moved to Bouillon Yvon continued his journalistic activities and contributed to the periodicals of Jean-Henri Maubert de Gouvest.Pierre Davoust et Emmanuel Davoust, Claude Yvon, un abbé écrivain et journaliste au siècle des Lumières, Bulletin de la Société d'Agriculture, Sciences et Arts de la Sarthe, n°902, 2015, pp.77-108 In 1754, Yvon's book La Liberté de conscience resserrée dans les bornes légitimes (\\"Freedom of conscience confined within legitimate bounds\\") was published in London in three volumes. In this book he argued that all religions were naturally intolerant and would attack their enemies, but that civil society should be tolerant of those who disagreed with the religious leaders. Yvon returned to France at the start of 1762. In 1763, Marc-Michel Rey in Amsterdam published a letter from Yvon answering some of Rousseau's criticisms of the Church, and more followed in the ensuing years. The tone of these letters was unexpected to those who had accused him of atheism, but was consistent with his other writings. He accused Rousseau of saying that no laws were good and no governments fair. He said that after making reckless personal attacks on religion and government, things sacred to all people, Rousseau was unrealistic in expecting no outrage against his views. At the beginning of 1767, Yvon became the editor of the Journal de l'Agriculture. The first two volumes of Yvon's ecclesiastical history appeared in 1778, published in Amsterdam, titled Discours généraux et raisonnés sur l'histoire de l'Église (\\"General and reasoned discourse on the history of the Church\\"). Ten more volumes were to follow, but did not appear. The first two drew the attention of the police, who raised the issue with the authorities, resulting in a ban on publication of the third volume. This caused a scandal in the press, and Yvon offered to make any corrections that the censor demanded, but to no avail. Yvon died in Paris in November 1789.http://enccre.academie- sciences.fr/encyclopedie/enc_collaborateurs_yvon.phpArchives de l'évéché de Coutances, Archives départementales de la Manche, 5E2993 At the time of his death he was historian of the Comte d'Artois. In retrospect, Yvon had great influence on the Encyclopédie. He was described by one historian as the metaphysician of Diderot's great work. Some articles Yvon wrote or contributed to many articles in the Encyclopédie, which reflected his philosophy. He discussed the Amusement philosophique sur le language des bêtes (Philosophical Amusements on the Language of the Animals) by Guillaume- Hyacinthe Bougeant, treating it as an example of witty and redescriptive rhetoric. In his article on \\"Aristotelianism\\" he said that Pietro Pomponazzi had \\"no God other than Aristotle\\". He could not accept that Pomponazzi could believe in Christian dogma while presenting a philosopher's views of immortality, determinism and miracles. Adam Smith criticized Yvon's article on \\"Amour\\" (love) as being too declamatory. He said of the article that it \\"will tend little to the edification either of the learned or the unlearned reader, and might, one should think, have been omitted even in an Encyclopedia of all arts, sciences and trades\\". In Yvon's article on \\"Freedom\\", he said that if man is free, he has a spirit. If he has a spirit, he is immortal. If he is immortal, he can have only God as his author. God must therefore be his judge, punishing him for his vices and rewarding him for his virtues. He concluded that liberty would be repugnant to all who chose to live independent of God.

He coined the term 'Indu-nesian', later adopted as the name for Indonesia. Biography Earl was born in London around 1813. He travelled to India after becoming a midshipman at age 14, then joined the colonists in Western Australia in 1830. In 1832 he resumed his nautical career, working between Batavia and Singapore, and gained the command of a trading ship. He returned to England and became involved in a scheme to colonise the North of Australia, leaving for Port Essington in 1838, but by 1845 the hardships and lack of success of the North Australia Expedition had exhausted him. He made a later venture to the region, promoting cotton and trade, with a similar result. From 1855 until his death he held a variety of official administrative positions in the region, his last post was at Penang. Earl died on a sea journey to England in 1865, and is buried at the Old Protestant Cemetery, George Town, Penang, in present-day Malaysia. Works G. W. Earl, who wrote on a diverse range of interests, was regarded as an authority on hydrography and a source of anthropological information on the peoples of the region. His works include papers and books,Openlibrary references and a number of pamphlets and other material relating to proposed ventures in Australia. His first major publications were The Eastern Seas or Voyages and Adventures in the Indian Archipelago 1832-33-34... (London, 1837), and Sailing directions for the Arafura Sea, 1839,Sailing directions for the Arafura Sea: compiled from the narratives of Lieuts. Kolff and Modera of the Dutch Navy online scan a translation from Dutch narratives of Dirk Hendrik Kolff and others. The records of his observations of deep-sea channels were used by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace when studying the disjuncts in the bio-geographic distribution of the region. In particular, his pamphlet On the Physical Geography of South-Eastern Asia and Australia, published in 1845, described how shallow seas connected islands on the west (Sumatra, Java, etc.) with the Asian continent and with similar wildlife, and islands on the east such as New Guinea were connected to Australia and were characterised by the presence of marsupials. This formed the inspiration for Alfred Russel Wallace to propose the faunal boundary line now known as the Wallace Line. He published a paper in 1850 that invented the term 'Indu-nesians', for a quaint racial classification, derived from the Greek for India and islands. He published a seminal anthropological reference on the Papuan peoples, compiled from first-hand accounts of other visitors to the region, though his direct contact or exploration of the land is unrecorded and seems unlikely. This work, The native races of the Indian Archipelago: Papuans, was the first in a projected series, further volumes on 'Malayu-Polynesians', Australians, and Moluccans were never realised. Amongst the sources for the material was information Earl obtained from interviews with Owen Stanley and Dumont d'Urville. The volume functioned as a standard reference on the people until the twentieth century, though based on a treatment as a racial classification, was noted for its focus on research from the field. The book included papers on racial types written in 1845, these were encouraged and edited by James Richardson Logan and published in Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia. Family George William Samuel Earl was born on 10 February 1832 in Hampstead, Middlesex, England to Percy William Earl (1771–1827), a ship's captain and Elizabeth née Sharp (c1778-1874). His sister, Elizabeth (1817–1890) married John Loftus Hartwell, an Assistant-Surgeon in the army; his elder brother Percy William Earl (1811–1846) was also a naturalist. George married Clara Siborne on 4 April 1846; they had a daughter Elizabeth Christiana Fernhill Earl (1847–1923) who married William John Alt (1840–1908) a successful Japanese merchant. George's granddaughter Anne 'Nancy' Alt (1873–1959) was the mother of Lt. Gen. Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning.

This process comprises two steps, the controlled oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and the net hydrolysis of ethylene oxide to monoethylene glycol (MEG). The first chemical plant using the OMEGA process was started in South Korea. Subsequent OMEGA plants have been started in Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Shell claims that this process, compared to conventional ones, does not produce higher glycols, uses less steam and water, and generates less waste. Ethylene oxidation To produce ethylene oxide, ethylene is oxidized with dioxygen in the presence of a silver catalyst. Some ethylene is over-oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, which is wasteful; early processes only gave ~ 65% selectivity for ethylene oxide as a result. In the OMEGA process, over- oxidation is reduced by including ethyl chloride as a moderator. Ethylene oxide hydrolysis Conventionally, monoethylene glycol (HOC2H4OH) is produced by the controlled hydrolysis of ethylene oxide (C2H4O). The monoethylene glycol product is also able to react with ethylene oxide to give diethylene glycol, and so on; sequential reaction with ethylene oxide is how poly(ethylene glycol) is produced. Due to monoethylene glycol's high boiling point, purification by distillation is energy intensive. : C2H4O + H2O -> HOC2H4OH In the OMEGA process, the ethylene oxide reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to yield ethylene carbonate (C3H4O3). Ethylene carbonate is subsequently hydrolyzed to monoethylene glycol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is released in this step again and can be fed back into the process circuit.

It originally aired on February 7, 2011. This episode followed the intended season finale, \\"Chuck Versus the Push Mix\\", making it the first of an additional eleven episodes ordered. Chuck Bartowski, Sarah Walker, and John Casey are sent to Morocco to rescue old friend Roan Montgomery (John Larroquette), while Morgan Grimes meets Alex Hugh's (Mekenna Melvin) mother (Clare Carey) and Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (Linda Hamilton) tries to reconnect with her family. Plot =Main plot= CIA seduction specialist Roan Montgomery (John Larroquette) goes on a rogue mission to Marrakesh, Morocco, to seduce and capture counterfeiter Fatima Tazi (Lesley- Ann Brandt). However, Tazi, known for leading a team of female mercenaries, seduces and captures Roan. John Casey, Chuck Bartowski, and Sarah Walker go to Castle to request a mission. When they call General Beckman, they find her drinking. She reveals that they can rescue Roan from Tazi, although they will be unsupported and in danger. They eagerly accept to escape their overwhelming families. After Tazi ties Roan up, he offers to be her head of distribution, using his international contacts to protect her flawless counterfeit bills (or \\"super notes\\") from the government. Team Bartowski sneaks in using a tracking device in Roan's watch. After tranquilizing Tazi's guards, they proceed to her bedroom, where they find Roan tied up and blindfolded. When they remove his blindfold, Roan reveals that he has seduced Tazi to infiltrate her counterfeiting ring. He orders them to hide so he and Tazi can \\"seal the deal.\\" When Chuck sneezes, Tazi has him, Sarah, and Roan placed in a dungeon. Casey crawls out from hiding under the bed and attempts to seduce the guard to the dungeon. He almost succeeds, but a comment about her weight offends her, so Casey tranquilizes her and uses an explosive to destroy the door. As they escape, Casey reveals that he will re-enter the building to continue the mission. Roan refuses to return with Chuck and Sarah, so Casey tranquilizes him before crawling back into the wall. Beckman assigns Roan to the Buy More as punishment for his actions. Casey watches as Tazi makes a deal with a nefarious Saudi oil tycoon that Chuck earlier flashed on. Tazi offers $1 trillion worth of her \\"super notes\\". When the tycoon stresses that his economy depends on a strong dollar, Tazi's women execute the tycoon and his associates without hesitation. Part of the load-bearing wall caves in on Casey, trapping him in the wall. Casey suggests removing his arm to free himself, but General Beckman orders him to wait for further instructions. She then orders Chuck and Sarah to find the location of Tazi's mint so she can destroy it and rescue Casey before he amputates his arm. Beckman permits them to take Roan, supposedly the only man who could seduce Fatima Tazi twice. Roan climbs up a wall and surrenders to Tazi. He expresses his love for her, and asks her what her motives are for releasing the super notes. She reveals her motives for collapsing the United States economy to avenge the destruction of her village. Beckman listens in and tracks Tazi's mint to her village, ordering an airstrike. Meanwhile, Tazi's guards find Chuck and Sarah trying to sneak Casey out. Tazi angrily orders the guards to execute them. However, Casey manages to shoot them through the wall and Chuck pulls him out. As Tazi holds Roan at gunpoint, Beckman calls his phone. Tazi answers and Beckman expresses her happiness to see him die. Beckman asks to speak with Roan, and she tells him to duck down. It is then revealed that Beckman has personally accompanied the team on their operation, firing a RPG to disable Tazi. =Roan and Beckman= It is revealed that General Beckman and Roan Montgomery have maintained an ongoing romantic relationship for some time. In Berlin, Germany, during the Fall of the Berlin Wall, they engaged in a tryst and promised to retire together if they survived the next twenty years. Beckman was subsequently angered when Montgomery went on a rogue operation rather than meet her as he promised. She personally joins the team in the field during one of their operations. When Beckman and Montgomery meet at the end of the episode, Beckman ironically admits that she also intended to break off plans to retire—both admit they are too involved in their work to be comfortable settling down in a \\"normal\\" life. Beckman only had Montgomery tracked down because \\"you don't run from a general.\\" =Mary and the Woodcombs= Having been freed from Volkoff Industries, Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (Linda Hamilton) joins her daughter and son-in-law Ellie and Devon Woodcomb to help with Clara. One night, Ellie overhears Mary telling Clara a bedtime story about being poisoned and woken by her partner with an antidote on his lips. Realizing Mary's desire to stay in the CIA, Ellie gives her consent to do so. Mary reveals that she is making up for missing Ellie and Chuck's childhoods, but Ellie insists that she only needs to be a grandmother. She changes the subject and asks about the agent that kissed Mary awake; Mary reveals that it was her husband. =Casey, Morgan, and Alex= Casey, his daughter Alex McHugh (Mekenna Melvin), and her boyfriend Morgan Grimes visit the Woodcombs to see Clara. When Casey talks about the stress of having a baby, Morgan changes the subject to Alex. Casey angrily suspects that Alex is pregnant, but he is relieved when Morgan denies it. However, Morgan reveals that Alex wants him to meet her mother Kathleen (who believes Casey [as Alexander Coburn] died prior to Alex's birth). Casey agrees to consider talking to Kathleen so Morgan will not have to lie. After Alex arranges for Morgan to meet Kathleen, Morgan reveals that Casey is going to contact Kathleen. This angers Alex, who only wants to see her mother happy. Morgan contacts Casey, telling him not to see Kathleen. Casey is confused; he asks if Alex will ever let him see Kathleen again. Casey drives to Kathleen's house to meet with her. As he walks to the door, Kathleen (Clare Carey), Morgan, and Alex come out with an older man. Casey realizes that Kathleen has moved on and, happy for her, decides to leave her alone. =Chuck and Sarah= Chuck and Sarah visit Ellie and Devon to see Clara, but they are overwhelmed with all their questions about their wedding. Chuck, who has finally gotten his family back together, would like to have a big wedding, but Sarah, who has no family to invite, asks to elope. Chuck asks Morgan for advice about saying, \\"No\\", and Morgan suggests saying it about several smaller issues first. During their mission, Chuck declines several items from Sarah, but he reluctantly accepts each time. Chuck and Sarah continue arguing about the wedding plans in the dungeon, with Chuck attached to a literal ball and chain. After they escape, Chuck asks for Roan's advice to seduce Sarah and convince her to have a big wedding. Chuck makes a dinner reservation and puts on a suit, only to find Sarah attempting to seduce him with a belly dance. They are each angered by the other's intentions. Later, Roan advises them to listen to each other and never go on a mission angry. As they search for Casey, Sarah reveals her real reasons for wanting to elope and they resolve their fight. Later, Chuck expresses a desire to meet Sarah's family. Production It was announced in January 2011 that John Larroquette would reprise his highly praised role of Roan Montgomery. Clare Carey also returned briefly as Alex's mother Kathleen McHugh. The episode was written by series co-creator Chris Fedak along with Kristin Newman. Though the episode takes place in Marrakesh, Morocco, the opening shots are actually of the Luxor Temple in Egypt. =Continuity= This episode's title references \\"Chuck Versus the Seduction\\", where Roan Montgomery originally appeared. Further, Casey's inability to seduce the dungeon guard is directly attributed to his failure of Roan's \\"seduction school\\". =Flashes= * Chuck flashes on a Saudi oil tycoon.

The episode received positive reviews from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 9 out of 10, praising Larroquette's performance and calling his flashback scene with Friedricy \\"hysterical\\".

Witkowsky (Евге́ний Влади́мирович Витко́вский; June 18, 1950 – February 3, 2020) was a Russian fiction and fantasy writer, literary scholar, poet, and translator.  Biography  Witkowsky came from a family of Russified Germans who owned a small cardboard factory in Moscow. He spent his childhood in Siberia, Central Asia, and Western Ukraine. From 1967–1971, he was a student of literary studies at Moscow State University, then took a leave of absence and never returned, becoming engaged in literature and dissident activities. Until censorship was lifted in USSR, Witkowsky could only publish poetic translations; he translated and published numerous poems by John Milton, Christopher Smart, Robert Southey, John Keats, Oscar Wilde, Rudyard Kipling; by Scottish gaelic poets John Roy Stewart, Duncan Ban MacIntyre, Rob Donn, John MacLean (Bard MacLean), and by Luís Vaz de Camões, Fernando Pessoa, Rainer Maria Rilke, Joost van den Vondel, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Valéry and others. In the 1990s, he was mostly engaged in literary studies, compiling and editing a four-volume anthology of Russian poetry abroad \\"We lived on a different planet those days\\", a three-volume collected works of Georgy Ivanov, works of Ivan Yelagin, Arseny Nesmelov and others. His three-volume historical fantasy \\"Paul II\\" was published in 2000, its two sequels, \\"Saint Vitus Land\\" and \\"Chertovar\\" in 2001 and 2007 respectively. The latter two novels were selected for the short list of the most prestigious Russian F&SF; prize, \\"The ABS Prize\\" (\\"Arkady and Boris Strugatsky Prize\\"). In 2003, Witkowsky founded website \\"Vek Perevoda\\" (\\"The Age of Translation\\", www.vekperevoda.com) with a web forum functioning as a school of poetic translation. In 2005 and 2006, Vodolei Publishers issued two anthologies of Russian poetic translation, based on the site's collections and edited by Witkowsky; this edition will be continued. In 2007, the same publisher printed an anthology \\"Seven Centuries of English Poetry\\" in three volumes (about 3000 pages), compiled by Witkowsky and presenting for the first time in a single edition works by almost 500 English-language poets from 1300 to 2000 recreated by 134 translators since the 1800s. This anthology exceeds twentyfold any other previous Russian edition devoted to the poets of England, Scotland and Ireland. Witkowsky was a laureate of several international awards, an Expert of the Translators' Union of Russia, member of the Writers' Union of USSR and Russia since 1983. His mentors in poetry were Arcadiy Shteinberg and Sergei Petrov.  Works  = Prose (novels) = * \\"Paul II\\". Vol. I: \\"God Forbid!\\". Vol. 2: \\"The Day of Piranha\\".

Life Broughton was born in Bristol in July 1787, the son of the Rev. Thomas Broughton, who became rector of St. Peter's, Bristol, in 1781. He was educated at the Grammar school, under Samuel Seyer, author of Memorials of Bristol. After studying at St George's Hospital he became assistant-surgeon of the Dorset militia, and in October 1812 was appointed assistant-surgeon of the 2nd Life Guards, of which . J. Carrick Moore, elder brother of the late General Sir John Moore, was then surgeon. Immediately afterwards Broughton was appointed additional surgeon with temporary rank, and placed in medical charge of the service squadrons of the regiment ordered abroad, with which he was present in the Iberian Peninsula and south of France to the end of the war. He was also with his regiment at the battle of Waterloo. In July 1821 he succeeded to the surgeoncy of the regiment on the resignation of Mr. Moore, who had just been granted a pension of £1,000 a year in recognition of the distinguished services of his late brother. Residing in London with his regiment, Broughton devoted himself to professional and scientific studies. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (in 1830) and of the Geological Society. In 1836 an injury to his leg, caused by a fall, resulted in disease of the ankle-joint which eventually rendered amputation necessary. The operation was performed by the eminent surgeon Liston, but he died ten days later at Regent's Park barracks on 20 August 1837. He was interred at Kensal Green cemetery. Writings He documented his campaigning experiences from Lisbon to Boulogne in a volume of Letters from Portugal, Spain, and France in 1812, 1813, and 1814 (London, 1815). A list of original papers, chiefly relating to physiological research, contributed by him to various scientific journals, is in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers, 1800–63, vol. i. With Mr. Wilcox, barrister-at-law, he produced and delivered lectures on forensic medicine and toxicology.

Background In the 18th century the deists of various European nations reveled in singing praises to God. Such odes were produced by Voltaire, Klopstock, Haller, Brockes and Young. In Russia, the fashion was set by Lomonosov's \\"The True God\\". Description Derzhavin commenced writing \\"God\\" in 1780, but finished it only in 1784, under the influence of a strong religious emotion. It begins with an appeal to God, then extols the infinite power and wisdom of the Divinity. The individual is the reflex of the Divinity, and hence not insignificant. The relationship to God is recognized and, therefore, immortality beyond the grave is assured. Translations Derzhavin's \\"God\\" was at once translated into most of the European languages and into Japanese by Admiral Golovnin. There are at least 15 French versions of the poem, while in English available translations include: \\"To God\\", in The Bakchesarian Fountain (Philadelphia, 1849) by W. D.

Long Island, a large island directly south of New England, has made attempts in the past to secede from New York and become its own state. Mentions of Long Island secession range from 1896 to 2010. The proposed 51st state has also speculated the combination of Nassau and Suffolk counties into one county in order to reduce costs. The state of Long Island would include over 2.7 million people, not including the more populous west end of the island. Nassau County executive Ed Mangano came out in support of such a proposal in April 2010 and was said to be commissioning a study on it.Sid Cassese and William Murphy. \\"Nassau Executive Mangano Supports LI as 51st State.\\" Newsday, (Melville, NY), April 30, 2010. http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=nfh&AN;=2W6468811411 Under Article Four, Section 3, clause 1 of the federal Constitution, both the New York State Legislature and the United States Congress would need to approve any secession from New York.Casesse, Sid and William Murphy (2010-05-01).

How the States Got Their Shapes Season 1 Episode 10 Mouthing Off, 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEvYXtD6bUk. Secession history The first known proposal of Long Island as its own state was published in The New York Times in 1896. Sugar refiner Adolph Molenhaur claimed other big cities in New York did not take Long Island into account when making decisions and were spending money without any benefit to Long Island's interests. In 1996, a non-binding vote took place in which the idea of secession was approved. However, no further action was taken at that time. On March 28, 2008, Suffolk County, New York comptroller Joseph Sawicki proposed a plan that would make Long Island (specifically, Nassau and Suffolk counties) the 51st state of the United States of America (or, should Upstate New York and/or Western New York be included in the breakup of New York State, the 52nd or 53rd). Sawicki said that all the Long Island taxpayers' money would stay on Long Island, rather than the funds being dispersed all over the entire state of New York. In 2009, there was a call for home rule of Long Island by political leaders who were angry about a tax. Suffolk County was on board with the plan but Nassau County showed no support. In 2010, the Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano had a plan to combine Nassau and Suffolk counties and to secede from New York and wanted to formally look into the idea. Supporters vs. non-supporters Supporters see secession not only as a major way to save money, but also as a way to keep Long Island unique, and to refrain from unwanted changes being made by New York state. The non-supporters do not agree with the logistics behind creating a separate state and do not think that the state and the government would agree to it. An extreme supporter is Cesidio Tallini. He created \\"Winnecomac\\", special code \\"WQ\\", which is the name for the entire island of Long Island as a nation separate from the United States. This idea was not popular among Long Islanders, but has gained attention from the media. Tallini was featured in the 2011 History Channel series How the States Got their Shapes, as well as in a 2007 article in The New York Times.

Life Broughton was born in London on 5 July 1704, the son of the rector of St. Andrew's, Holborn. He was educated at Eton, before going up to Cambridge in about 1723. There \\"for the sake of a scholarship he entered himself of Gonville and Caius College.\\" In 1727, after taking B.A., he was admitted to deacon's orders, and in 1728 he was ordained priest, and proceeded to the M.A. He served for several years as curate of Offley, Hertfordshire, and in 1739 became rector of Stepington, Huntingdonshire; the patron, the Duke of Bedford, also appointing him one of his chaplains.Stepington is now more usually known as Stibbington: see As reader to the Temple, to which he was chosen soon afterwards, he won the favour of the master, Bishop Sherlock, who in 1744 presented him to the vicarage of Bedminster, near Bristol, with the chapels of St. Mary Redcliffe, St. Thomas, and Abbot's Leigh annexed. It was also to Sherlock's influence he owed a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, on receiving which he moved from London to Bristol, where he died on 21 December 1774. Writing He was an industrious writer in many kinds of composition. He published an Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times (1742), a huge work in two volumes folio ; he translated Voltaire's Temple of Taste and part of Pierre Bayle's Dictionary; vindicated orthodox Christianity against Matthew Tindal; converted a Roman Catholic book (Dorrel on the Epistles and Gospels) to Protestant uses; edited John Dryden; wrote in defence of the immortality of the soul; and contributed the lives marked 'T' in the original edition of the Biographia Britannica. John Hawkins, in his Life of Johnson, credits Broughton with being the real translator of Jarvis's Don Quixote: > The fact is that Jarvis laboured at it many years, but could make but little > progress, for being a painter by profession, he had not been accustomed to > write, and had no style. Mr. Tonson, the bookseller, seeing this, suggested > the thought of employing Mr. Broughton . . . who sat himself down to study > the Spanish language, and in a few months acquired, as was pretended, > sufficient knowledge thereof to give to the world a translation of \\"Don > Quixote\\" in the true spirit of the original, and to which is prefixed the > name of Jarvis. Broughton, a lover of music, knew Handel, and supplied words for some of his compositions, including a libretto based on Sophocles' Women of Trachis and the ninth book of Ovid's Metamophises for the drama Hercules, first performed at the Haymarket in 1745. Handel's biographer, Paul Henry Lang, praises Broughton's libretto for its \\"good theatrical sense\\" and the way in which it peels away any extraneous elements of the narrative to concentrate on the central drama of jealousy. In private life, Broughton was of a mild and amiable disposition, but in controversy, though not discourteous according to the standard of his time, he was very economical in his concessions to his opponents, and he has been characterised in some respects as a weak and credulous writer.

Career =Club= Early career McCarthy started his professional career playing for Premiership club London Wasps in the 2001–02 season. He made a single substitute appearance for the team in that year's Premiership against Sale Sharks, and did not play in any European games. The following season he made an increased number of appearances, playing 3 times in the 2002–03 Premiership as Wasps won the title.

In the following season, McCarthy made a total 23 appearances for the team, including starting all of Connacht's matches in the 2009–10 European Challenge Cup, as they made it to the semi-finals. The team faced a Toulon team featuring the English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, a former Newcastle teammate of McCarthy's. Toulon won 19–12 in Galway, with Wilkinson kicking 14 of the French club's points. The following season saw McCarthy start in every one of Connacht's 22 2010–11 Celtic League, and appear in all 6 of the team's Challenge Cup games, starting only one of these games on the bench, though Connacht failed to make it past the pool stages. He earned his 100th cap for Connacht that season, against Bayonne in the Challenge Cup on 15 January 2011. The 2011–12 season saw Connacht qualify for the Heineken Cup for the first time. McCarthy started every one of Connacht's games, including the team's first ever win in the competition, in the home game against Harlequins.

Life Broughton, the son of another Thomas Broughton, said to have been at one time commissioner of excise at Edinburgh, was born in Oxford. When he matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 13 December 1731, his father was described as of \\"Carfax in Oxford\\". He was elected Petreian fellow at Exeter College on 30 June 1733, and became full fellow on 14 July 1734, taking his degree of B.A. on 22 March 1737. Soon after becoming an undergraduate he joined the little band of young men known as 'Methodists,' and remained a sympathiser with the Wesleys for several years, until differences of opinion on the Moravian doctrines led to their separation. Broughton's first clerical duty was at Cowley, near Uxbridge, and he was curate at the Tower of London in 1736. Through George Whitefield's influence he obtained the lectureship at St Helen's Bishopsgate, but as some of the parishioners objected to Whitefield's preaching from its pulpit he withdrew from the post. He visited the prisoners in Newgate Prison and was indefatigable in doing good. In 1741 he was appointed lecturer at Allhallows, Lombard Street, and two years later was elected secretary to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, a position which he retained until his death. His only other preferment was the living of Wotton in Surrey, which he held from 1752 to 1777. He died at the society's house in Hatton Garden, London, 21 December 1777. He held his fellowship at Exeter College until July 1741. In 1742 he married Miss Capel, by whom he had fifteen children, five of whom died young.

He was born in Bucharest, Romania, in the family of a Jewish architect. While studying at Gheorghe Lazăr High School, he attended the scientific conferences organised by the local folk university. Here he met and befriended several young workers, who introduced him to socialists ideas. In 1918, when socialist militants Gheorghe Cristescu, Alecu Constantinescu and Ecaterina Arbore were arrested by the German authorities occupying southern Romania, Leon was one of the organisers of a public demonstration demanding their release. He was also a participant in the manifestations which accompanied the departure of the German Army, being noted for his pro-revolutionary and anti-monarchical chants. On December 13, 1918 Leon Lichtblau was arrested along with other militants during a large workers' demonstration in Bucharest. Sent to trial for \\"rebellion and unrest\\", he was reproached by the presiding judge for his political opinions. To the judge's allegation that students, and people of intellectual background in general, shouldn't be taking part in the socialist movement, he replied by reading a list of socialist leaders, whom he identified as his role models. In 1920, after completing high school, he enrolled in the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Mathematics. In the same year he accommodated anarchist Max Goldstein while the latter was preparing for the bombing of the Romanian Senate. In 1921 he went to Iaşi to support the local workers' movement, but soon returned to Bucharest, narrowly escaping arrest during the crackdown on the Socialist Conference taking place in the former city. Back in Bucharest he participated in the May 1921 Congress of the Socialist Party of Romania, where he supported the party's affiliation with the Comintern. In the summer of that year he was part of the Romanian delegation to the Second Congress of the Young Communist International in Moscow. On his return to Romania he found out that the authorities were offering a 200,000 lei reward for his and others communists' capture, and went into hiding. On October 15, the 2nd Army Corps issued an arrest warrant on his name. Pressure was put on his family to reveal his location, his home was repeatedly searched, his brother interrogated, while his sister was forced to sign a declaration condemning Leon's activities to be allowed to finish her studies at the Bucharest Conservatory. Leon Lichtblau eventually fled the country, staying in Vienna, and, after being expelled from Austria, in Berlin. In 1922, as part of the Dealul Spirii Trial, he was sentenced in absentia to lifetime forced labour, and another arrest warrant was issued for him. Not able to return to Romania, Leon settled in Moscow, adopting the pseudonym Adolf Cristin. Here he graduated in economics from the Institute of Red Professors in 1926, later becoming the head of the Industry Department of the Central Office of Economic Accounting of the USSR. At the request of the communists in Romania, he translated a part of Vladimir Lenin's works in Romanian, under the coordination of David Fabian. For a short time in 1928 he was a member in Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania, along with fellow exiles Fabian and Elek Köblös. He was arrested on April 5, 1937, during the Stalinist purges. On April 25, 1938 he was indicted with \\"spying and provocative activities and membership in a right-wing counter-revolutionary organisation\\", and was executed on the same day. Leon Lichtblau was posthumously rehabilitated by a decision of the Soviet Supreme Court on October 3, 1956, as well as by a commission of the Romanian Communist Party in 1968.

Background The bill that annexed the Republic of Texas to the United States in 1845 allowed up to four new States, in addition to the State of Texas, to be formed out of the territory of the former Republic of Texas. This was due to the fact that Texas was the largest state in the Union at the time and in belief that the population would be shared equally between the planned states. With a few division plans drawn up before the Civil War, Reconstruction brought carpetbaggers that sought the additional government positions that the division of Texas would provide. So the readmittance Constitutional Convention led to five plans being introduced and additional plans of division lines. In the end, the Convention adopted no plan.Claude Elliott, \\"DIVISION OF TEXAS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed July 06, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. 1870 With no plan from the Texas Convention, a Congressional plan was drafted to create a State of Lincoln from Texas. This plan never made it out of the committee. Instead, the Howard Bill was introduced calling for two territories and future states, Jefferson and Matagorda, to be formed from Texas. Texas east of the San Antonio River was designated as Jefferson. The rump Texas would then be admitted under Reconstruction plans. The new territories would join when they were considered able to function as states. A competing plan from the state in 1871 proposed a north, east, south, and west division. Neither legislature made final approval of either plan. The \\"division of the state\\" issue continued over the years with an additional plan in 1906. 1915 With no reapportionment of representatives following the thirteenth U.S. Census, discussion of the division question was renewed in 1914. The western part of Texas had grown in population, and thus should have gotten more representation, but this was dismissed by the legislature. Hardly any state institutions were in the western part of the state. In the Texas Senate, a proposed State of Jefferson was introduced, to be formed from the twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, twenty- eighth, and twenty-ninth state senate districts. With only six senators supporting the bill, it failed. Support grew for the State of Jefferson in 1921 with the governor's veto over an agricultural and mechanical college to be located in West Texas. While no bill was proposed, west Texas held a popular meeting over the matter, but support quickly declined.

Crocker family View from the northeast corner of the cemetery The massive Mark Hopkins, Jr. grave The Sacramento Historic City Cemetery (or Old City Cemetery), located at 1000 Broadway, at 10th Street, is the oldest existing cemetery in Sacramento, California. It was designed to resemble a Victorian garden and sections that are not located in level areas are surrounded by brick or concrete retaining walls to create level terraces. The cemetery grounds are noted for their roses which are said to be among the finest in California. History The cemetery was established in 1849 when Sacramento founder John Augustus Sutter, Jr. donated to the city for this purpose.Sutter, John A., Jr. & Ottley, Allan R. (Ed.). Statement: Regarding Early California Experiences. Sacramento Book Collectors Club. 1943. The grounds were landscaped in the Victorian Garden style popular at the time. In 1850, 600 victims of the Cholera epidemic that swept the city were buried in mass graves in City Cemetery. The remainder of the 800 to 1000 victims claimed by the epidemic were buried in the nearby New Helvetia Cemetery, also in mass graves. Because the New Helvetia Cemetery was prone to flooding, these graves were later transferred to City Cemetery. In 1852, a monument was erected to those who died. Howerer the exact location of either burial plot is not known. In 1856, the city engaged a cemetery superintendent and began to plan the grounds. In 1857, the gatehouse and bell tower were constructed. These were demolished in 1949 during the widening of Broadway. Several fraternal groups purchased sections for their members including the Masons (1859), Odd Fellows (1861) and the Sacramento Pioneers Association (1862). The city set aside a section for volunteer firemen in 1858 and members of the Grand Army of the Republic in 1878. The cemetery continued to acquire additional land through 1880 when Margaret Crocker, widow of Edwin B. Crocker, donated to expand the grounds to total. It was declared a State Historic Landmark on May 5, 1957 by the State Historical Landmarks Commission. The City of Sacramento owns the cemetery, which today encompasses . .

The hamlet is documented in the Domesday Book of 1086, which documents that Burghelm (Borel) held two hides of land and a William Hard owned four hides in Terintone or Tedlinton. In the 14th century, William Percehay, John Turpyn and Walter Scudamore held the Tytherton Knight's Fee, serving the Crown with feudal obligations. In around 1150, the tithes of Tytherton and Chippenham were granted to Monkton Farleigh Priory by Empress Matilda. By 1650, the local chapel had fallen into a dilapidated state, and the parishioners wished opted to form a new independent parish with East Tytherton, Bremhill and Langley Burre. Landmarks The Grade II* listed Anglican church of St Nicholas is a chapel of ease belonging to St Andrew's, Chippenham, dating from the 13th century and rebuilt in 1802. The church bell is from the 12th century, making it one of the oldest in the county. Manor Farmhouse, from the 17th century, is also Grade II* listed. Other farms are from the 17th and 19th centuries.

Its nearest town is Chippenham, which lies approximately south-west from the hamlet. Geography East Tytherton is located on a minor road in a valley some northeast of Chippenham and a similar distance northwest of Calne in the civil parish of Bremhill. It has a rectangular village green around which the grey stone manor and the other residences are clustered. One timber-framed house has painted brick walls and a corrugated iron roof. History A house at East Tytherton was bought by preacher John Cennick in 1742 and a Moravian community was founded in 1745; a chapel, manse and church cottage were built for the community. The manse and chapel were rebuilt between 1792 and 1793 and a schoolroom was added in 1793-1794. The chapel, manse and former schoolroom are red brick buildings with ashlar dressings and stone slate roofs, and are Grade II* listed. The chapel is a single storey structure with a pair of two-storey houses attached at either end. The manse has a timber bell-cot at the east end. As of 2016, the church is still in use. The Moravian school was built to house fifty pupils and at one time actually had seventy. The school closed in 1931. Nearby, a British school opened in 1871 and became a County school in the 20th century, later named Maud Heath School. Pupil numbers declined from the 1950s and the school closed at the end of 2005. In 2016 the building was an activity centre for Girl Guides.

Description The term dema comes from the Marind-anim peoples of south-west Papua and has been used to refer to similar concepts in Melanesian Religion and elsewhere. Dema Deities are mythological figures (human, animal, or super-human) who have given to certain peoples their land, food-crops, totems, and knowledge such as how to cultivate crops, raise poultry, make boats, perform dances, and perform sacred rituals. In some cases, such as in the Hainuwele myth of Seram recorded by Jensen, it is claimed that from their dismembered bodies, blood, etc., came the different communities that are now in existence, together with their territory. Both local culture and natural environment remain infused with the supernatural power of these creative deities.

Even the two remaining selections that did not bring chart success to the original artists were by the hit songwriting teams of Burt Bacharach and Hal David (\\"Don't Go Breakin' My Heart\\") and John Lennon and Paul McCartney (\\"Here, There and Everywhere\\") and left no room for the usual inclusion of some original songs or material from Broadway. The album debuted on Billboard magazine's Top LPs chart in the issue dated April 13 of that year and reached number 26 over the course of 40 weeks..

It follows a scientist (Peter Weller) in his quest to time travel back and save his fiancée, while the Fringe team investigates the consequences of his actions, and Walter (John Noble) struggles to tell his son Peter (Joshua Jackson) he was stolen from the parallel universe as a boy. The episode was co-written by J.H. Wyman and Jeff Vlaming, and was directed by Thomas Yatsko. Wyman later stressed the importance of \\"White Tulip\\" in the show's evolution, calling it a \\"mythalone\\" because its elements were designed to create the ideal episode to satisfy both new and hardcore viewers. Elements from this episode, in particular the idea of the white tulip as a sign of forgiveness, would be reused in later episodes. It first aired in the United States on April 15, 2010 on Fox to an estimated 6.624 million viewers. It received positive reviews, and earned a nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. It was ranked the best episode of the entire series by Entertainment Weekly, while IGN and Den of Geek ranked it as the second best. Plot Walter (John Noble) struggles with writing a letter to Peter (Joshua Jackson) to explain the events from 1985 that led Walter to bring Peter to his universe from the parallel one. As he contemplates the final letter, he and the rest of the Fringe team are called to investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car of a train. Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck (Peter Weller), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel. Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there, and activates a mechanism on his body, causing him to travel back in time. Alistair reappears on the train at the same point in time as his previous travel, again having drained the people aboard it, and alters his behavior to avoid another encounter with the Fringe team. However, when they are brought to investigate this time, they have a feeling of déjà vu and find other evidence that points to Alistair, and determine that he is trying to go back in his personal time line several months ago to prevent the death of his fiancée in a car collision. Alistair is found at his MIT office. Walter, having read through Alistair's writings on time travel, offers to go in and talk to Alistair first before the armed officers attempt to seize him. As a central theme of the episode, Walter seeks the sign of a white tulip as a sign of God's forgiveness and hope that Peter can forgive him. White tulips represent forgiveness. Walter approaches Alistair as a fellow man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require a great deal more power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip. Alistair considers this, but with Walter's time up, a SWAT team starts to move in. Alistair jumps back in time again by only a few hours to complete the modified power calculations based on Walter's comments, and to prepare a pre-addressed letter he brings with him. As the SWAT team barges in, Alistair re-engages his time machine. Alistair's modifications have worked, as he finds himself in the field, minutes before his fiancée's death. Alistair is able to make it to his fiancée in time, reuniting with her in the car just long enough to say \\"I love you\\" before they are both killed by the collision. In the present, the events of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to contemplate the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into the fireplace. Later, he receives an envelope in the mail—the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered to Walter on this specific date. Inside, Walter finds a drawing of a white tulip. Production Executive producer J. H. Wyman particularly loved \\"White Tulip\\" because it was a love story. \\"White Tulip\\" was co-written by executive producer J. H. Wyman and supervising producer Jeff Vlaming. Cinematographer Thomas Yatsko directed the episode, his first directing credit for Fringe. IGN announced in January 2010 that actor Peter Weller had been cast in a guest starring role for an upcoming episode. Though he had normally kept his distance from episodic television because it \\"burns [him] out\\" and he was pursuing a Ph.D at UCLA, his wife, a big Fringe fan, read the script and convinced him to accept the part of Alistair Peck, telling him \\"You've got to do this, it's beautiful, it's about a guy who wants to save his wife\\". During a conference call with journalists, Weller also cited the character's \\"tremendously romantic and very moving\\" storyline as another reason he accepted the part. He thought the four-page scripted scene between him and John Noble was \\"rare for television [and] wonderfully written. I was thrilled to do [Fringe]\\". Weller has since become a fan of Fringe because of his work in the episode, and would love to return and direct for the show. In a later Twitter post, Wyman dismissed speculation and confirmed that Weller's character Alistair Peck did indeed die at the end of the episode. For the episode's time travel elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis explained his choices of sound during an interview with Designing Sound: \\"I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted to play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create the idea that he was somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device\\". Executive producer J. H. Wyman later indicated how \\"White Tulip\\" helped with the evolution of the show in an interview: \\"It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution came in the form of ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties\\". He and Pinkner later listed \\"White Tulip\\" as one of their favorite episodes. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox and Science Olympiad released a lesson plan for grade school children based upon the science depicted in \\"White Tulip\\"; the lesson's intention was for \\"students [to] learn about scientific concepts related to time such as astronomy and physics, with a focus on timekeeping.\\" Reception =Ratings= \\"White Tulip\\" was watched by an estimated 6.62 million viewers in the United States, with a 4.0/7 share among all households and a 2.5/7 share among those aged 18–49. =Reviews= Reviews of \\"White Tulip\\" were overwhelmingly positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode, writing \\"Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases\\". He also praised guest star Peter Weller's performance. After initially expecting a \\"filler\\" episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN said he was \\"pleasantly proven wrong\\", as the \\"story turned out to be one of the best of the series\\". Isler continued that \\"the writers really did a good job of integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good... It's brilliant storytelling\\". Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, explaining \\"Horror. Confusion. It's a moment that finds Fringe at its finest\\". New York Magazine's Tim Grierson loved all the interactions between Noble and Weller, and thought they were so \\"compelling together that they helped justify an episode that could have very easily been terribly hokey — instead, it was one of the season’s best standalone stories\\". Josh Wigler from MTV also thought the scenes between Noble and Weller were the best thing about the episode. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wrote it was \\"another great episode that served to propel the story forward, and another great performance by John Noble\\". Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+. The A.V. Club ranked Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, in particular highlighting \\"White Tulip\\", while Den of Geek listed it as the second best of the series. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"White Tulip\\" the best episode of the entire series, calling it \\"a near-perfect blend of mythology and stand-alone episode. 'White Tulip' is Fringes purest, finest example of fulsome emotions tempered by stringent ideas. The tulip of the title represents forgiveness — faith in love — and became within the series a semi-recurring symbol of fragile hope, and, to the show's audience, a cynosure of the devotion of Fringe fandom.\\" IGN ranked it as the second best, explaining that \\"despite a few technical flaws with special effects and a little under-utilization of Weller in the first half, the veteran cast delivers an excellent script with skill.\\" \\"White Tulip\\" was referenced multiple times in the season three episode \\"Subject 13\\". Executive producer J. H. Wyman later commented in an interview that \\"the 'White Tulip' stuff is all connected thematically because that was the episode where Walter believes in God,\\" and further explained that these themes would return again in the season three finale. The final reference to the white tulip is in season five, the series finale, which aired January 18, 2013. =Awards and nominations= \\"White Tulip\\" was nominated for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Series at the Creative Arts portion of the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, with the crew composed of Supervising Sound Editor Paul Curtis, Sound Editors Rick Norman and Bruce Tanis, Music Editor Paul Apelgren, and Foley Artists Shelley Roden and Rick Partlow. It lost to an episode of 24. \\"White Tulip\\" was also nominated for Outstanding Sound at the 2010 HPA Awards, but it lost to an episode of House. Also at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, writers J.H. Wyman and Jeff Vlaming submitted \\"White Tulip\\" for consideration in the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series category, but failed to garner a nomination. Peter Weller submitted the episode for consideration in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series category. Weller and fellow guest actor Leonard Nimoy (who appeared in \\"Over There\\") were not chosen for nominations.

On certain days of Lent, Roman Catholics traditionally abstained from the consumption of meat and poultry, hence the term \\"carnival,\\" from carnelevare, \\"to remove (literally, \\"raise\\") meat.\\" Organization One of the first major festivals of the year in Madeira, apart from the Dia dos Reis, the Madeira carnival is known as one of the best in Europe. Traditionally, there are two main carnival parades in Madeira, which are very different from each other. The allegoric parade, which takes place always on the Saturday of the Carnival weekend, is the more sophisticated one and needs a great deal of commitment and organisation from all the groups and the people involved. Numerous samba groups with thousands of participants in magnificent and colourful costumes dance to electrifying samba music through the streets of Funchal, spreading an ambiance evoking the Rio Carnival. The second parade, called ‘trapalhão’, is older and used to occur all over the island, now it floods the streets of the city centre with thrilling joy on Terça-feira Gorda, ending the Carnival period. In this parade everybody can take part and the – sometimes quite daring – costumes and depicted caricatures are left to the participants’ own imagination. Both parades have a defined itinerary in the city centre and end at the Municipal Square (Praça do Município) where more entertainment with live music and costume competitions is provided. At least one month before the Carnival peak time the best-known and established Carnival groups visit the hotels and entertain the guests with dance and music performances. During the 19th century people from Madeira emigrated to Hawaii and took the tradition of Malasadas on Terça-feira Gorda (Shrove Tuesday) with them, now it is called Malasada Day in Hawaii. Traditionally the people of Madeira eat Malasadas on Terça-feira Gorda (Shrove Tuesday), the reason for making malasadas was to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lent (much in the same way the tradition of Pancake Day in the UK originated on Shrove Tuesday), Malasadas are sold alongside the main carnival parade on Saturday and on the last one, the trapalhão on Terça-feira Gorda (Shrove Tuesday). Arguably, the Brazilian Carnival could be historically traced to the period of the Portuguese Age of Discoveries when their caravels passed regularly through Madeira, a territory which already celebrated emphatically its carnival season, and where they were loaded with goods but also people and their ludic and cultural expressions who then lend them to what would become the biggest cultural manifestation in modern Brazil.

He is now the Kirby Professor in Constitutional Government at Hillsdale College and the Dean of the Van Andel Graduate School of Government at Hillsdale College’s Washington, D.C., campus. As Vice President for Washington Operations, he also oversees the Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship and the academic and educational programs of Hillsdale in the nation’s capital. In November 2009, the book reached number two on the Washington Post non-fiction bestseller list. We Still Hold These Truths is also the title of a 2004 non-fiction political history book by Ronald L. Hirsch, a retired non-profit executive, lawyer, and consultant. Overview Spalding's focus in the book is the United States' \\"first principles\\", his belief that those principles have been betrayed by the American Left, and his plan for how conservatives can work to restore the vision of the Founding Fathers. Spalding takes the reader through the earliest days of American history to the present, demonstrating these principles were understood by the Founders and shaped the U.S. national identity. According to Spalding, the erosion of these principles began with the Progressives of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who believed in centralization, bureaucracy, relativism and a lack of absolute truths, and who, Spalding writes, sought to undermine the vision of the U.S. Constitution's framers. Spalding calls today's liberals \\"pimps for the new progressivism,\\" inspired by New Dealers and proponents of the Great Society. Spalding also writes that recent Republican electoral victories and the successes of the Tea Party demonstrate that Americans still believe in the vision outlined by the Founding Fathers, and that a debate over the Constitution has been given new life everywhere from law schools to the federal government. The book's foreword is written by conservative commentator William Bennett, who writes that We Still Hold These Truths \\"makes a clear and compelling case for America's principles as an enduring source of real, practical guidance for today explaining how we got so far off track, and laying out how to get our nation back on course.\\" Hirsch has a very different reading of those principles found in our founding documents. This is not as surprising as it may appear, for as Hirsch says in his book, “in [the Declaration’s] interpretation lies the core of both the Liberal and Conservative ideologies that have run through American political life and the tension between them.”Hirsch, We Still Hold These Truths Hirsch looks at the words of the Declaration and finds an all-embracing, profoundly Liberal, statement of the equality of all people and that all have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that, as stated in the Declaration, the role of government is to secure these rights. Hirsch then goes on to use the Declaration of Independence as a touchstone to examine nine key areas of government policy.Hirsch, We Still Hold These Truths, p.1-4 Ironically, just as Spalding feels that Progressives eroded the founding principles, Hirsch believes that, “our nation stands at a crossroad. There is a radical Republican movement afoot to fundamentally alter the balance that our system has struck between private rights, the public good, and government. The issue is not simply big versus small government, high versus low taxes. At risk is the heart of our democracy, our historic values.” Hirsch, We Still Hold These Truths, Back Cover Hirsch states that current Republicans focus solely on rights of the individual, quite divorced from their responsibilities as citizens and from the rights of others and the common good. Since the Declaration states that all men are created equal and all have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the system can only work if one says that each person has this liberty so long as it does not harm others or impinge on the rights of others. This last proposition is in fact the basis for all government laws and regulation, whether of individuals or corporations. Reception The book received positive reviews from conservative-leaning reviewers, including The Weekly Standard, National Review and The Washington Times, and reached No. 2 on the Washington Posts non- fiction bestseller list. According to columnist Cal Thomas, Spalding's book offers a \\"long-range strategy\\" for conservatives \\"if they want to save the country from the long-term consequences of what many call 'socialism.'\\" As a self-published book, Hirsch's We Still Hold These Truths has received no newspaper reviews. However, it has received acclaim and endorsement from a variety of sources, the most notable being: \\"The 2004 presidential election has the potential to be one of the most important in decades. Every fundamental question of national values and national policy is up for debate - or should be . . . . Ron Hirsch's We Still Hold These Truths is a systematic and serious effort to make that debate as clear and valuable as it can be. Agree or disagree with his specific conclusions, the questions he is asking are the right ones for the public this year.\\" —James Fallows, National Correspondent, The Atlantic Fallows, James, printed under Pre-publication Acclaim Another type of recognition came from a group of citizens from Wisconsin who paid for the publication of a speech by Ron Hirsch, “Fighting for the Soul of America,” based on the book, in the Ozaukee Press, October 28. 2004 Hirsch, Ronald, Ozaukee Press, October 28, 2004, p. 13B References Sources * External links *We Still Hold These Truths *Matthew Spalding—Heritage Foundation biography Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Political books Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States Category:American political books ","title":"We Still Hold These Truths"},{"id":"30536820","text":"Betta unimaculata , the Howong betta, is a species of labyrinth fish endemic to the island of Borneo where it is only known from the eastern portion of the island.

He was an early proponent of mathematical methods in physiology. Life Born in Edinburgh on 27 March 1673 the son of Sarah Cockburn and Robert Keill, an Edinburgh lawyer. He was the younger brother of John Keill, and the nephew of William Cockburn. He was educated partly at home, studying under Andrew Massey and (probably) David Gregory at the University of Edinburgh, and partly on the continent, studying under Nicolas Lemery and (probably) Jean Guichard Duverney in Paris, followed by a period at Leyden University. He applied himself to anatomy, and, moving to England, acquired a reputation by lecturing on anatomy at Oxford and Cambridge (which conferred on him the degree of MD). With the degree, but without belonging to the College of Physicians, he settled in 1703 as a physician at Northampton, where he continued for the rest of his life. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1712. He died unmarried on 16 July 1719 of a cancer of the mouth, and was buried in St Giles's Church, Northampton, where a monument, with a Latin inscription, was erected to his memory by his brother John. Works He was an active supporter of the mechanical or ‘iatro-mathematical’ school of medicine; some of his ideas derived from his brother, a mathematician. He discussed by mathematical methods, combined with experiment, several physiological problems, such as secretion, the amount of blood in the body, muscular motion, and the force of the heart. On the latter point he corrected an exaggerated estimate of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli; but his own results were not satisfactory, and were criticised by James Jurin in the Philosophical Transactions. Keill's essays were, however, esteemed. He also made a series of physiological observations on himself, after the manner of Santorio Sanctorius, published as ‘Medicina statica Britannica,’ in the third edition of his essays. Keill's major work appeared first as ‘An Account of Animal Secretion, the Quantity of Blood in the Humane Body, and Muscular Motion,’ London, 1708; 2nd edit. enlarged under the new title of ‘Essays on several Parts of the Animal Œconomy,’ London, 1717; 3rd edit. (Latin), ‘Tentamina Medico-Physica, &c.; Quibus accessit Medicina statica Britannica,’ London, 1718; 4th edit., containing in addition ‘A Dissertation concerning the Force of the Heart, by James Jurin, M.D., with Dr. Keill's Answer and Dr. Jurin's Reply; also Medicina statica Britannica, &c.;, explained and compared with the Aphorisms of Sanctorius, by John Quincy, M.D.,’ London, 1738. He wrote also ‘The Anatomy of the Human Body, abridged,’ London, 1698, 15th edit. 1771; ‘An Account of the Death and Dissection of John Bayles of Northampton, reputed to have been 130 years old’ (Phil.

Malfunctions range from temporary and relatively safe situations, such as a casing that did not eject, to potentially dangerous occurrences that may permanently damage the gun and cause injury or death. Improper handling of certain types of malfunctions can be very dangerous. The basic rules of firearms safety should be followed at all times to minimize the risk to shooters and bystanders. Proper cleaning and maintenance of a firearm play a big role in preventing malfunctions.  Cartridge malfunctions  = Case head separation = Case head separation occurs when the walls of the casing become thin or fatigued. Upon firing the round, the case separates into two pieces near the head. It is not uncommon with brass that has been reloaded several times. =Dud= A dud (also a misfire or failure to fire) occurs when the trigger is pulled but the primer or powder in the cartridge malfunctions, causing the firearm not to discharge. Dud rounds can still be dangerous and should be deactivated and disposed of properly. = Hang fire = A hang fire (also delayed discharge) is an unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. Whenever a firearm fails to fire, but has not clearly malfunctioned, a hang fire should be suspected. When this occurs, the correct procedure is to keep the firearm pointed downrange or in a safe direction for thirty to sixty seconds, then remove and safely discard the round (which is now a dud as explained above if the primer was struck, otherwise the gun itself may have malfunctioned). The reason for this is that a round functioning outside of the firearm, or in the firearm with the action open (out-of-battery discharge), could cause a serious fragmentation hazard. = Squib load = A squib load (also squib round, squib, squib fire, insufficient discharge, incomplete discharge) is an extremely dangerous malfunction that happens when a fired projectile does not carry enough force and becomes stuck in the gun barrel instead of exiting it. In the case of semi-automatic or automatic weapons, this can cause subsequent rounds to impact the projectile obstructing the barrel, which can cause a catastrophic failure of the structural integrity of the firearm, posing a threat to the operator or bystanders. The bullet from a squib stuck in the barrel must never be cleared by subsequently attempting to fire a live or blank round into an obstructed barrel. Blank rounds use a type of powder different from that of other rounds, and generate much more pressure, which, combined with the presence of the projectile obstructing the barrel may cause the firearm to fail catastrophically.  Mechanical malfunctions  Mechanical malfunctions of a firearm (commonly called jams) include failures to feed, extract, or eject a cartridge; failure to fully cycle after firing; and failure of a recoil- or gas-operated firearm to lock back when empty (largely a procedural hazard, as \\"slide lock\\" is a visual cue that the firearm is empty). In extreme cases, an overloaded round, blocked barrel, poor design, or severely weakened breech can result in an explosive failure of the receiver, barrel, or other parts of the firearm. = Failure to feed = Failure to feed (FTF) is when a firearm fails to feed the next round into the firing chamber. Failure to feed is common when the shooter does not hold the firearm firmly (known as limp wristing), when the slide is not fully cycled by the preceding round, or due to problems with the magazine. It can also be caused by worn recoil springs, buffer springs, or simply a dirty feed ramp. = Rim lock = Rim lock is where the rim of the shell casing gets caught on the extractor groove of the casing underneath it. It is a common issue for calibers with large rims, such as 7.62×54mmR, or guns that have been rechambered for cartridges shorter than intended without replacing the original magazine with one that compensates for the shorter round. = Hammer follow = Hammer follow occurs when the disconnector allows the hammer to follow the bolt and firing pin into battery, sometimes causing the firing mechanism to function without pulling the trigger. This is usually a result of extreme wear or outright breakage of firing mechanism components, and can result in uncontrollable \\"full-auto\\" operation, in which multiple rounds are discharged following a single pull of the trigger. = Slamfire = A slamfire is a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a round is being loaded into the chamber, when the bolt \\"slams\\" forward (hence the name), as a result of the firing pin having not been retracted into the bolt, or from the firing pin being carried forward by the momentum of returning to battery. Similar to a hammer follow malfunction, this can result in uncontrollable \\"full-auto\\" operation. = Failure to extract = A failure to extract occurs when the casing of the just-fired round is not successfully extracted from the chamber. This can be caused by an overly-dirty chamber, broken extractor claw, case rim failures, or several other causes. = Failure to eject = A failure to eject (FTE) occurs when the casing of the just-fired round is extracted from the chamber, but is not ejected from the firearm, causing the next round to fail to feed, or the slide/bolt to fail to return to battery. A stovepipe is common type of FTE. = Stovepipe = Failure to eject (FTE, \\"stovepipe\\") in a semi-automatic pistol. A stovepipe or smokestack typically occurs in pump action, semi- automatic, and fully automatic firearms that fire from a closed bolt, when an empty cartridge case gets caught partway out of the ejection port instead of being thrown clear. Stovepipes can be caused by a malfunctioning or defective extractor or ejector, or when the shooter does not hold the firearm firmly enough for the action to function fully, known as limp wristing, or due to reloads that are not sufficiently powerful to fully cycle the action, etc. = Double feed (Type 3 Malfunction) = A double feed occurs when two rounds are picked up from the magazine and both are moved to be fed into the chamber at the same time. This is usually due to a bad magazine but can also be the result of a bad recoil spring. = Out-of-battery ignition = A firearm is \\"in-battery\\" when the slide/bolt is in the normal firing position. A firearm is \\"out-of-battery\\" when the slide/bolt/action is not fully seated in the normal firing position, typically because it did not cycle fully after firing (called \\"returning to battery\\"). Most modern firearms are designed to not be capable of firing when significantly out-of-battery. As such, a firearm that is out-of-battery typically cannot be fired, which is why this is a type of firearm malfunction. A dangerous situation can occur when a chambered round fires when the firearm is out-of-battery (called an out-of-battery discharge). The cartridge casing is not sufficiently strong to contain the pressure of firing by itself; it relies on the walls of the chamber and the bolt face to help contain the pressure. When the firearm is out-of-battery, the round is not fully chambered, or the bolt face is not against the rear of the cartridge, and if the round is fired in this situation, the case will fail, causing high-pressure hot gasses, bits of burning powder, and fragments of the casing itself to be thrown at high speed from the firearm. This can be a serious hazard to the operator of the firearm, and any bystanders.  Prevention  Some mechanical malfunctions are caused by poor design and cannot easily be avoided. Some malfunctions with cartridges can be attributed to poor quality or damaged ammunition (often due to improper storage, exposure to moisture). Many malfunctions, however, can be prevented by proper cleaning and maintenance of the firearm.

It is on three floors, archaeology on the ground floor, art on the first, and puppets on the second floor. Entry is free for citizens of the European Union. The origin of the museum came in 1835, when art was confiscated from a monastery, including paintings by Zurbarán taken from the Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera. Other paintings included the works of Murillo and Rubens. The collection grew during the century, due to the city's Academy of Fine Arts which practised romanticism and neoclassicism. In 1877, after a Phoenician sarcophagus was found in the city's shipyard, the Archaeological Museum was founded. However, it was not until 1970 that the two institutes, despite sharing the same building, were merged. From 1980, the architect Javier Feduchi planned a reform of the building in three phases, of which two have been completed. In addition to the 19th- century pieces, the art museum has received contemporary art from the Junta de Andalucía. Its archaeological section has also received donations, particularly of coins.

The arias show a \\"decrescendo\\" (Alfred Dürr), a diminishing of the number of instruments, towards the central Schweigt, ihr Flöten, schweigt, ihr Töne (Silence, you flutes, silence, you tones), in which the voice corresponds with the flute as in a duet. The following arias are scored \\"crescendo\\" until the final festive movement.

Since 1991, Transparent Language has been offering its products to individual consumers, and in the past decade has grown to provide services for educational institutions and government agencies, ranging from MIT to the Department of Defense. Methodology Transparent Language’s products are developed based on the declarative method of learning. The human brain has two memory systems: declarative and procedural. The declarative system is responsible for remembering facts (such as words, phrases, or dates) while the procedural system learns skills (such as riding a bike). Language learning depends on both of these systems, as vocabulary is learned declaratively, and the associated grammar rules are learned procedurally by recognizing implicit patterns in the vocabulary and phrases learned. Backed by this linguistic research, the company holds the position that vocabulary is more fundamental to language learning than grammar. Since declarative items are best learned through repeated exposure, Transparent Language programs track learning and employ an algorithm to repeat vocabulary at the appropriate intervals to ensure memorization, a practice known as spaced repetition. A vocabulary item must be repeated several times to be considered “learned”, and after a specific period of time, these “learned” items must be refreshed in order to be committed to the memory. Products and services Transparent Language partners with more than 12,000 K-12 schools, universities, and libraries to offer its language learning products to students and communities. These institutions integrate Transparent Language Online into their classroom instruction or provide access to the program in their resource libraries. The company also has a substantial involvement in government language learning programs. =The CL-150 Platform= For the government sector, Transparent Language develops the CL-150 Platformhttps://www.transparent.com/government/, which is licensed by a number of United States Government organizations, including several Department of Defense agencies. The CL-150 Platform is a centralized platform for the acquisition and sustainment of language for specialized government purposes. =Transparent Language Online= Transparent Language Online (TLO) is a web-delivered language learning platform that provides access to the full suite of products, including the Byki vocabulary lists, Essentials course, a grammar reference section including grammar videos and written explanations, and cultural resources including language blogs and social communities. TLO is available for individual subscriptions, as well as school and library subscriptions. =Transparent Connect= Since September 2011, Transparent Language has been offering language courses through Transparent Connect. The language courses combine self-guided learning and personal instruction. Transparent Connect is available in 8 languages and in 3 different levels of instruction: * Live classroom courses: Weekly courses taught by a live instructor and access to supplemental learning materials and the Byki Mobile app * Self-guided courses: Access to learning materials and private coaching * Online tutoring: Private coaching tailored to the student’s learning goals and proficiency =Essentials= The Essentials course is a language acquisition course designed to help users communicate in a foreign language in everyday life or while traveling. The 30 lesson course is available in 33 languages, and covers vocabulary and phrases relevant to topics such as going shopping, dealing with money, getting help in an emergency, and asking for directions. Essentials courses are available as part of Transparent Language Online or Transparent Connect. =Byki= Byki was discontinued in 2017. Before You Know It (known as Byki) was a flashcard- based language acquisition software designed for beginners looking to build a large vocabulary base. 7000 Languages Project Transparent Language originally launched the Heritage and Endangered Language Program (HELP) to give back to the language community. Through this program, Transparent Language offers free support to organizations to create software programs for less commonly taught or endangered languages. The company has partnered Grassroots Indigenous Multimedia to preserve the Native American language Ojibwe, and has worked with BASAbali to create a course for Balinese, a threatened language spoken on the Indonesian island of Bali. The program equips these partners with tools to continue teaching their language of interest, while also exposing the language to the entire Transparent Language user base. The CEO, Michael Quinlan, explains Transparent Language's commitment to this initiative in this way: \\"We live in an age of global interaction. No language is so small that no one needs to learn it. If we could, we would provide learning material for all 7,000 languages in the world.\\" In April 2013, Transparent Language announced the launch of the 7000 Languages Project. The initiative replaces and expands upon the former Heritage and Endangered Language Program in an effort to provide the company's language learning technology and platforms to under-resourced languages, in conjunction with NCOLCTL. In 2017, the 7000 Languages Project became an independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization, still committed to the goal of preserving and promoting endangered and indigenous languages. Transparent Language continues to donate its technology in support of the organization's language courses.

The area was lightly fortified, since the Swiss border was regarded as a low-risk frontier, save for the possibility of an advance from Germany through Switzerland into France. The Jura Mountains and the Doubs River presented natural barriers to invasion, allowing defenses to concentrate on a few points of potential access. The SF Jura was bordered on the east by the Fortified Sector of Montbéliard.Mary, Tome 1, p. 15 Concept and organization Bunker on the Lac de Remoray The sector's chief fortifications were old Séré de Rivières positions like the Fort de Joux, Fort de Larmont and the Fort Saint-Antione. A late effort in 1939-1940 constructed the CEZF Line, consisting of two sections of casemates. The northern section around Morteau consisted of four casemates, of fourteen proposed. The southern section around Pontarlier consisted of three completed of six casemates proposed. Road barriers were built at Goumois, La Goule, Biaufond and La Rasse. Crossings of the Doubs were fortified at Villiers-le- Lac, Morteau, Pont-de-la-Roche and La Cluse. Command The Jura sector was under the command General Huet, commanding a demi-brigade of chasseurs pyrénéens. From 15 January 1940 the Jura Army Corps (corps d'armée du Jura) took responsibility for field operations in the Jura. Within ten days it was renamed the 45th Army Fortress Corps (45e corps d'armée de foretresse). The corps comprised the 57th Infantry Division under General Texier, and the 63rd Infantry Division under General Parvy. Both were class B reserve divisions, not suitable for heavy or sustained combat. The SF Jura was attached to the 45th CAF on 16 March 1940. Until 19 May, the 45th CAF was an autonomous unit. Afterwards it was attached to the 8th Army.Mary, Tome 3, p. 146 At the midpoint of the Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the SF Jura amounted to a chasseurs pyrénéens regiment in three battalions, comprising 85 officers and 2,750 men.Mary, Tome 3, p. 189 Battle of France The German offensive (Operation Kleiner Bär) across the Rhine was concentrated in the area near and to the north of Colmar, with little fighting in the Altkirch sector.

That followed decades of sporadic English settlement on the island, which was at first seasonal, rather than permanent. It was made a Crown colony in 1854 and a Dominion in 1907. Its economy collapsed during the Great Depression, and Newfoundland relinquished its dominion status, becoming once again a Crown colony governed by appointees from the Colonial Office in Whitehall in London. American forces occupied much of the colony in World War II, and prosperity returned. In 1949, the colony voted to join Canada as the Province of Newfoundland, but in 2001, its name was officially changed to Newfoundland and Labrador. History Indigenous people like the Beothuk (known as skrælingjar in Greenlandic Norse), and Innu were the first inhabitants of Newfoundland and Labrador. During the late 15th century, European explorers like João Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar Corte-Real, John Cabot, Jacques Cartier and others began visiting the area. From around the beginning of the 16th century, fishing vessels with English, Portuguese, French and Spanish crews started visiting on a seasonal basis. At some point during the early 16th Century, some of these fishing crews founded an informal settlement at Placentia. The Beothuk gradually became extinct as a people, as they suffered from new infectious diseases carried by the colonists, to which they had no immunity and the loss of habitat due to English and French settlement. From 1610 onwards, the Kingdom of England established colonial settlements in Newfoundland, led by proprietary governors, as England tried to create North American footholds. John Guy was governor of the first settlement at Cuper's Cove. Other settlements were Bristol's Hope, Renews, New Cambriol, South Falkland and Avalon, which was organized as a province in 1623. The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was Sir David Kirke in 1638. During this period, France had also established settlements in the region, particularly to the west in what is now Quebec. It had strong trading ties to many of the indigenous peoples along the Atlantic Coast, including the Mi'kmaq and other Algonquian-speaking peoples. The rivalry between England and France in Europe was played out in conflicts in North America, where they struggled for predominance. This was particularly true in Newfoundland, where the English colonial settlements on the eastern coasts were in close proximity to the French claims in Southern Newfoundland, which the French dubbed Plaisance. The Newfoundland colony was nearly obliterated during the Avalon Peninsula Campaign of King William's War. In 1696 the French and allied Mi'kmaq armed forces wiped out all but a handful of English settlements on the island of Newfoundland. Over the next year, the English repopulated and rebuilt the colony. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 ceded all of Newfoundland to the British Crown. Given the Newfoundland colony's isolation from the more southern British Thirteen Colonies in North America (and also from the still loyal colony of Nova Scotia, which provided a buffer), it did not become involved in their colonial rebellion of the 1770s. After the American Revolutionary War ended in 1783 with the independence of the United States, Newfoundland Colony became part of British North America. The Crown resettled some Loyalists in Newfoundland, but most were given land in Nova Scotia and present-day Ontario. It became an official Crown colony in 1825, and Thomas John Cochrane, an officer of the Royal Navy, was appointed as its first governor.Biography at Government House The Governorship of Newfoundland and Labrador He directed the construction of Government House, which is located between Fort William and Fort Townshend. It has been designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. The colony was granted a constitution in 1832, and Cochrane became its first civil governor. The colony was granted self-governing status in 1854. Philip Francis Little was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. The colony rejected confederation with Canada in the period of 1864–69. In 1907, Newfoundland became the Dominion of Newfoundland, a Dominion of the British Empire. Due to economic hardship in 1934 it suspended its self- government and accepted rule by a royal commission. Together with Labrador, an area on the mainland, it confederated with Canada in 1949 as the province of Newfoundland. In 2001 the province was officially renamed Newfoundland and Labrador.

To fulfill the economic needs of Jamaica's rapidly expanding population, the President of the Jamaica Savings Bank, George S. Downing, felt that the creation of more bank branches was necessary. In December 1934, the Queensboro Savings Bank (located at 90-55 Sutphin Boulevard) was merged with the Jamaica Savings Bank. As a result, the Queensboro Savings Bank was henceforth known as the Jamaica Savings Bank; the bank with the Jamaica Avenue address became the Main Office of the company and the Sutphin Boulevard address served as the Branch Office.

This unique art deco building featured striking decorative features; its most notable feature being the American eagle carved in a low relief and placed over the entrance. \\"Ornamental cast bronze doors grace the entrance which opens upon a semicircular vestibule lined with marble of black and gold...Furnishings in American walnut, bronze lighting fixtures...and carpets of and draperies of harmonious design and hue complete the interior.\\"Jamaica Savings Bank Opens New Sutphin Blvd. Building\\" \\"QueensBorough\\", Published by the Chamber of Commerce of the Borough of Queens, April, 1939. Retrieved from the Archives of the Queens Public Library =Late 20th century= The modern Jamaica Savings Bank of 1964 is on the corner of 161st Street in downtown Jamaica just across from its Victorian predecessor. Constructed as the new headquarters, the bank built a modernistic steel blue facade with a curved wall of blue Venetian glass. The concave entrance continues the accents and it was given an annual architectural award for commercial buildings for innovation by the Queens Chamber of Commerce.https://hdc.org/29-jamaica- savings-bank-grace-episcopal-church-memorial-hall-queens-general-court- building-to-be-heard-at-lpc/ The award cites the fireproofing materials of gray glazed enamel brick, incorporation of stainless steel columns, and the exterior blue mosaic panels. The building interior had a wrap-around interior mural 162 ft x 11 ft depicting themes of historic Jamaica that included Captain Kidd, the Muscogee Native American tribe and Revolutionary War General Nathaniel Woodhull. The fourth branch was built during 1966-1968 at a 56th Avenue and Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst, next to the Queens Place Mall.http://www.roadarch.com/modarch/nybank.html Legacy The legacy of the Jamaica Savings Bank lasted for nearly a century until the bank was acquired by North Fork Bank in 1999, which itself was acquired by Capital One Bank in 2008.https://queensmodern.com/project/jamaica-savings-bank/ As of this writing, the Sutphin Boulevard branch of the Jamaica Savings Bank building is a Capital One Bank branch. The original Jamaica Savings Bank building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and a New York City Landmark in 2008. The second branch building on Sutphin Boulevard was dedicated as a New York City Landmark in 2010. The third building has closed and a sneaker company resides inside, the mural is no longer visible.

It has been considered in the context of both pulp and paper manufacture and biorefining for subsequent conversion of cellulose to fuel ethanol. The process was invented by Theodor Kleinert in 1968 as an environmentally benign alternative to kraft pulping. Organosolv has several advantages when compared to other popular methods such as kraft or sulfite pulping. In particular, the ability to obtain relatively high quality lignin adds value to a process stream otherwise considered as waste. Organosolv solvents are easily recovered by distillation, leading to less water pollution and elimination of the odour usually associated with kraft pulping. Solvents Organosolv pulping involves contacting a lignocellulosic feedstock such as chipped wood with an aqueous organic solvent at temperatures ranging from 140 to 220 °C. This causes lignin to break down by hydrolytic cleavage of alpha aryl-ether links into fragments that are soluble in the solvent system. Solvents used include acetone, methanol, ethanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, formic acid, and acetic acid. The concentration of solvent in water ranges from 40 to 80%. Higher boiling solvents have the advantage of a lower process pressure. This is weighed against the more difficult solvent recovery by distillation.Sarkanen, KV, Acid-catalysed delignification of lignocellulosics in organic solvents, in Progress in Biomass Conversion, K V Sarkanen and D A Tillman, Editors. (1980), Academic Press. p. 127-144. Ethanol has been suggested as the preferred solvent due to cost and easy recovery. Although butanol is shown to remove more lignin than other solvents and solvent recovery is simplified due to immiscibility in water, its high cost limits its use. For pulp production Numerous authors report that pulping with ethanol-water solutions gives a lignin free pulp yield 4–4.5% higher than that of kraft pulp.Alcaide, LJ, Dominguez, JCG, Ot, IP, Influence of cooking variables in the organosolv pulping of wheat straw using mixtures of ethanol, acetone, and water. TAPPI, (2003). 2(1): p. 27-31.Garrote, G, Eugenio, ME, Diaz, MJ, Ariza, J, Lopez, F, Hydrothermal and pulp processing of Eucalyptus. Bioresource Technology, (2003). 88(1): p. 61-68.Kleinert, TN, Organosolvent pulping with aqueous alcohol. TAPPI, (1974). 57(8): p. 99-102.Pye, EK, Lora, JH, The Alcell process. A proven alternative to kraft pulping. TAPPI, (1991). 74(3): p. 113-118. The commonly used solvents acetone and ethanol have been examined with respect to pulp properties. The pulping of wheat straw with 40% mixtures of acetone or ethanol with water requires 60 minutes at 180 °C to give good pulp properties. Organic solvents are almost always used as a mixture with water for process considerations such as reducing the vapour pressure and lowering the pH in order to also solubilise hemicellulose. Only some small organosolv pulp mills are run today for production of pulp from annual renewable non wood fibre sources like straw, bagasse, etc. For fuel ethanol production Recently, due to the popularity of second generation biofuels, the organosolv process has been considered in the context of bioethanol production. Cellulose from the organosolv process is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis into glucose followed by fermentation to dilute ethanol. The organosolv fractionation of mountain beetle killed lodgepole pine has yielded 97% conversion to glucose. Pan et al. recovered 79% of the lignin using conditions of 170 °C, 1.1% w/w H2SO4, 65% v/v ethanol for 60 minutes. Furthermore, ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw was used to produce biohydrogen using Enterobacter aerogenes. The effect of temperature (120–180 °C), residence time (30–90 min), and ethanol concentration (45–75% v/v) on the hydrogen yield, residual biomass, and lignin recovery was investigated using RSM. The glucose concentration at the optimum conditions was 4.22-fold of untreated straw. Lignin recovery The recovery of lignin from ethylene glycol organosolv pulping can be effected by 3 times dilution with acidified water. The lignin precipitates and forms spherical aggregates ranging from 0.5–2.5 µm. Filtration, while time consuming, is then most effective while the mixture is hot (>100 °C).Thring, RW, Chornet, E, Overend, RP, Recovery of a solvolytic lignin - effects of spent liquor acid volume ratio, acid concentration and temperature. Biomass, (1990). 23(4): p. 289-305. Recovery can be achieved by filtration or centrifugation. Due to the hydrophobic nature of organosolv lignin, flotation of organosolv lignin is effective without the use of the collecting and precipitating agentsMacfarlane, AL, Prestidge, R, Farid, MM, Chen, JJJ, Dissolved air flotation: A novel approach to recovery of organosolv lignin. Chemical Engineering Journal, (2009). 148(1): p. 15-19. that are required for flotation of kraft lignin. Processes = Organocell = Organocell uses two-stage organosolv with roughly 50% methanol solutions. Sodium hydroxide is added in the second stage at a loading of 30% w/w of the dry wood. The lignin from the second stage is isolated by adding phosphoric acid until a pH of 4.0 is reached.Lindner, A, Wegener, G, Characterization of lignins from organosolv pulping according to the organocell process. 1. Elemental analysis, nonlignin portions and functional-groups. Journal of Wood Chemistry and Technology, (1988). 8(3): p. 323-340. = Alcell = The Alcohol Pulping and Recovery (APR) process treats wood in 3 stages, each using increasingly cleaner solvent. The important process parameters are extraction time, temperature, solvent composition and pH. Pilot plant operation has shown that ethanol pulping produces pulp superior to sulphite pulp at a lower cost. Lignin and hemicellulose are recovered in high yields. In 1987 the APR process was renamed the Alcell process. The process uses aqueous ethanol solutions (40–60% v/v) to delignifying wood at temperatures from 180–210 °C and 2–3.5 MPa. Solvent is recovered with flash evaporation, vapour condensation and vacuum stripping.Diebold, VB, Cowan, WF, Walsh, JK, Solvent pulping process, (1978), C P Associates Ltd: US patent 4.100.016. A demonstration organosolv pulp mill operated in Miramichi, New Brunswick, Canada from 1989 to 1996 using the Alcell process. Repap owned the IP to the process when taken over by hedge funds in 1997. The pilot plant boasted superior environmental performance, excellent bleached pulp, an economically attractive scale of 300 tons/day and commercially attractive by-products. It is said that the technology can be used to exploit small regions of hardwood resource that could not support a modern sized kraft mill. = CIMV process = Compagnie Industrielle de la Materière Végétale in France have developed a process where wheat straw is treated with acetic acid / formic acid / water (30/55/15 v/v/v) for 3.5 h at 105 °C under atmospheric pressure. The obtained fibres are screened and bleached. At this conditions the lignin is dissolved and hemicelluloses are hydrolysed to oligo and monosaccharides. Organic acids are collected by concentration of the cooking liquor and then lignin is precipitated by adding water and high pressure filtration. = Chempolis process = Chempolis Ltd in Oulu, Finland is running a process where common non-wood fibre sources are treated with formic acid in a single-stage process. Process in run for 200–040 min at 110–125 °C. Bleaching is done with hydrogen peroxide at several stages. Chemical recovery is done by evaporation and distillation of the formic acid. The solids consisting of lignin and wood extracticves is dried and may be further processed or burned for energy production. = American Science and Technology (AST) process = American Science and Technology (AST) based out of Chicago, Illinois, USA, has developed a process which uses a patented second generation Organosolv process to convert any kind of biomass to more than 10 industrial fine chemicals, organic intermediates and solvents. With a 2 ton/day production facility located in Wausau, Wisconsin, AST can also make high quality pulp, glucose, fructose and lignin. With the AST process, lignocellulosic biomass is treated with sulfuric acid, water, butanol and other organic solvents, water, an organic or inorganic acid, and catalyst for one to three hours at 150 to 200 °C. The results produce fibers that are screened and bleached for paper products. At these conditions, the lignin is dissolved in organic solvent and hemicelluloses are used to produce more organic solvent. Organic solvents are collected by separating water from the cooking liquor and then the lignin is precipitated by adding water, heat, and filtration. = Bloom process = The Bloom process was developed at EPFL in Lausanne and is commercialised by Bloom Biorenewables Sàrl. This method is based on a protection chemistry that prevents lignin and C5 sugars condensation.

The title means \\"whichever-ly\\" (adding ungrammatical adverbial endings is a shtick of the main character). It was released in Italy on 600 copies on January 21, 2011 and was screened in the Main Programme of the Panorama section at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.  Plot  Corrupt and sleazy entrepreneur Cetto La Qualunque comes back to Italy and \\"si butta in politica\\" meaning he \\"jumps into politics\\" lest his law-abiding opponent, Giovanni De Santis, is elected as mayor. Cetto La Qualunque is an entrepreneur from Calabria, a region in the South of Italy; he's very crude and vulgar, an embodiment of the Southern Italian society, also represented by corrupted politicians, administrators and auditors. While being a fugitive from the law in a Latin American country, Cetto met a beautiful girl, whom he calls \\"Cosa\\" (a particular word in Italy like \\"you\\" or to better say \\"thing\\" for calling people whom name are not remembered or irrelevant) comparing her to an object; he conceived a daughter with her whose name he doesn't even remember. When Cetto gets back to his hometown of Marina di Sopra (\\"Upper Sea Side\\"), in Calabria, his wife goes on a rampage after seeing his concubine alongside her husband. Cetto also has a son named Melo (short name for Carmelo but also meaning \\"Apple Tree\\") who lived with his mother while he was away, and who is awkward and shy. After Cetto makes his triumphal comeback to his house, which looks like a typical 'ndrangheta mansion ('ndrangheta is the Calabrian name for the organised crime, the local mafia), he goes to his club in the nearby town, where he meets his friends who support him in every wickedness he commits. Cetto also owns a campsite, wrongly named \\"Paradais Village\\" a misspell of \\"Paradise Village\\", a very kitch and shabby place. During the meeting, his friends also tell him about his hated neighbour De Santis's intention to run for Mayor of Marina di Sopra, to improve the economic and cultural plight of the people, since almost every of them is poor peasants. Hearing this news, Cetto decides to run for Mayor of the town as well. He does everything possible to be voted by the people of the town, but his ignorance and narrow-mindedness does not impress journalists and reporters, so Cetto is forced to call a manager, Gerry Salerno, from Bari but living most recently in Milan. Cetto just sees Pino as \\"The Stranger\\" (that's because Cetto is from Calabria while Pino is originally from Apulia, a different region) as a turncoat fellow since he left the South of Italy to go to the North, somehow betraying its cultural heritage. Cetto begins the campaign with Gerry, using tricks, cheating and deceit against the peasants inhabitants of Marina di Sopra. Meanwhile, Cetto also tries to make his son a \\"made man\\" or a \\"wise guy\\", forcing him to leave his girlfriend because she is not curvy enough; together the two of them go hunting illegally in protected areas, shoot at mannequins that resemble black men. At the end of this father to soon life trip Cetto forces Melo to have sex with his favourite prostitute so to prove its manhood. Stressed by the events related to the elections Cetto divorces his wife Carmen and quickly plans to marry his new girlfriend Cosa from South America. The story has a twist when Cavallaro of the Carabinieri a righteous military officer (who has been trying for years to send to jail Cetto for all its illegalities and underworld activities) having no evidence, discovers that Cetto does not have a building permit for his pizzeria. Unfortunately when he goes to arrest him, Cetto has already changed the pizzeria's documents making his son the owner so to send him to prison instead. This way, Cetto has the opportunity to continue his electoral campaign. Meanwhile, his wife Carmen believes her husband to be a real heartless monster and leaves him, while Cetto is preparing to hold its election speech in the square, and he promises procurement and abolition of taxes, but also guarantees the arrival of many prostitutes that he commonly nicknamed \\"pilu\\" (female pubic hair, south Italian slang for \\"pussy\\"). Thanks to Gerry and the corruption of the reporter Calogero, Cetto knocks down the good intentions of De Santis and is elected mayor of Marina di Sopra. While Cetto is partying, Gerry leaves Italy and brings with him \\"Cosa\\" to give her a dignified life and to provide the little daughter a good education.

The character of Cetto La Qualunque Antonio Albanese plays Cetto La Qualunque Cetto La Qualunque is a character that shows perfectly the low culture of many politicians nowadays, even though he's a very marked caricature. Even the same last name \\"La Qualunque\\" (The Whatever) has a role in the creation of the character of the corrupt politician who thinks only to cultivate his interests in the small town of Marina di Sopra in Calabria. He has links with the Mafia and responds rudely to anyone in the country that tries to contradict him. Cetto is a cruel man, although not in a dictatorial way. He is also extremely racist, homophobic and ignorant towards the general culture and any human right. His only reference point is women who loves him and he uses them as simple household objects, demanding with strength that his wife Carmen gets used to his concubine (roughly called \\"Thing\\") that he has decided to stay at his residence together with the small family. Cetto's son Melo will be sorely tried by these cruel treatment, especially when the father, in order to not to end up in jail, sends his child instead, telling him unceremoniously that the prison is a training place for young people, almost better than a university. What is most surprising in the film of Cetto's character is the fact that he wants to run for mayor of the small town to avoid ending up in jail. The other candidate, Giovanni De Santis, is a quiet man who observes the law with honesty. Cetto will be forced to destroy him in any possible way so that he can be elected mayor. He knows how to engage the gullible and ignorant people like him with his speeches in the town square. Cetto promises every time plenty of prostitutes on the streets and total cancellation of taxes, which is quite impossible in a normal country. When asked what he plans to do for the poor people, displaced persons and the handicapped, Cetto answers that will leave them all to rot in the sewers, almost formulating a racial discourse similar to those of Mussolini. In the film there is also a sequence in which Cetto begins to converse with his henchmen and replies amazed: \\"Crazy things!\\" when a colleague tells him that in that country the police came to arrest a man only because he fired with his gun to his neighbor, without wondering if this man was killed because he was a spy or a thug by half a point. Sequel Tutto tutto niente niente is the 2012 sequel directed by Giulio Manfredonia, screenplay by Antonio Albanese and Piero Guerrera, produced by Domenico Procacci for Fandango and Leo with Rai Cinema and distributed by 01.

Playing career =Club= Early career and Veszprém success Éles started his career in Budapest Spartacus SC in the Hungarian second division. He moved to first division side Pemű-Honvéd in 1989 and led the team of the little town of Solymár to a podium place in 1991. His performances attracted the attention of domestic powerhouse KC Veszprém, which ran under the name Bramac SE at the time, and Éles was signed by the Bakony-side team in the summer of 1991. He spent thirteen years in Veszprém and won an impressive ten Hungarian Championship and as many Hungarian Cup titles. During his spell at the club, Veszprém transformed to an acclaimed and feared opponent on continental level as well: they lifted the EHF Cup Winners' Cup trophy in 1992, after beating TSV Milbertshofen in the finals. They were only one step away to repeat their success in the next season, however, this time they fell short against OM Vitrolles. Car crash On 1 July 2000, in the early hours Éles crashed his car into a ditch near Kiskunmajsa. The handballer was taken to the hospital of Kiskunhalas in a serious but not life-threatening condition. He was diagnosed with brain concussion, a broken collarbone and torn knee ligaments. He went through several operations and it was initially doubtful whether he would be able to play professional handball again. He left the hospital on July 18, and began a long rehabilitation process in Veszprém. He fully recovered from his injury and returned to the field on a pre-season friendly tournament in Germany on 29 August 2001. Playing abroad and first coaching steps Éles won back his old form, and led his team into the EHF Champions League finals in 2002, where they faced SC Magdeburg. After winning the first leg on a two goals difference, the German team showed their class and turned the things around with a 30–25 victory on home soil. In early 2003 there were rumors about the possible departure of Éles as he was linked with many clubs including THW Kiel, HSG Nordhorn and TV Grosswallstadt. He finally signed a two-year contract with AO Filippos Verias, where he joined former legends Aleksandr Tuchkin and Vyacheslav Atavin. Yet in the summer of 2003 there was organized a farewell match for Éles between his old and new club. The left back has worn his legendary number 6 shirt the very last time, that was eventually retired after the game. In December 2004, GC Amiticia Zürich made a special offer to sign Éles as a player and coach. His existing contract was terminated by mutual agreement, went into immediate effect, and Éles joined the Swiss club in January. Under his guidance the team performed excellent, and finished second at the end of the season. However, after a rich businessman, Arnold Schuler took over the club and merged it with Grasshoppers, the things have changed quickly. Schuler had his plan and Éles was released to make space for his own players and staff. Not much later he was approached by TV Endingen, the team that finished just behind Amiticia in the second division campaign that year. Éles accepted a one-year deal and since then he concentrates fully on his coaching career. =International= He made his international debut on 24 November 1989 against Bulgaria. His first major tournament was the 1992 Summer Olympics, where the Hungarian team placed seventh. One year later he participated on the 1993 World Championship in Sweden, where despite Hungary finished on a disappointing eleventh place, Éles topped the scoring charts with 41 goals. On the 1997 World Championship he was in inspired form once again and finished second on the top scorers' list with 59 goals, only three short to Yoon Kyung-shin. He was present on further two World Championships in 1995 and 1999, and also played on the 1994 European Championship. Coaching career Éles functioned first as a player- coach during his late years by GC Amiticia Zürich before turned into a full- time trainer in 2006. After his contract was terminated by the new owner of Amiticia, he signed a one-year deal with TV Endingen in May 2007. However, he left the club for relegation struggling CSU Politehnica Timişoara as early as March 2008 with only five matches left from the ongoing Romanian championship. His mission to keep the purple-whites in the top division failed on the field, but due to the expansion of the league his team maintained their Liga Națională membership. Éles revealed his wish to train a Hungarian team earlier, and although Poli became a mid-table team with a strengthened squad in the following season, when in October 2008 he was offered a contract by Gyöngyösi FKK, he did not hesitate too long and joined the Nemzeti Bajnokság I outfit. He achieved his first success as coach with Gyöngyös, when took the Hungarian Cup bronze medal after beating Ferencvárosi TC. Since finalists SC Pick Szeged and MKB Veszprém already secured their place in the Champions League, with this bronze medal Gyöngyös also earned a spot in the Cup Winners' Cup for next year. However, despite the good results in the cup, the club get relegated from the Hungarian championship at the end of the season and Éles was sacked. The last team he managed up to date is the women's handball club Kiskunhalas NKSE. He took the hot seat in October 2009, when the club was at the very bottom of the table without a single point. Éles could not make miracle and Kiskunhalas finished second from behind at the end of the season. As a result, his contract was not extended, but as he stated it was a very useful experience for him. He never worked with women before and he was pleasantly surprised. He felt they work more diligent and more humble than men, and also added that if he had to choose at the moment, he would rather train women in the future. On 15 February 2011 Éles was appointed as the head coach of the Dominican Republic women's national team and was set the goal to reach a podium place on the forthcoming Pan American Games and thus qualify for the 2011 World Championship. In order to fulfil this plan, the team will train in Hungary for two months, starting from early April and will play friendly matches against Hungarian club teams. Personal He has two sons, Benedek and Zsombor. They train in the Éles Kézisuli, a handball academy that was founded by Éles and wears his name.

Equipped with one siege battery, a Spanish expedition of 700 troops attacked the buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga, capturing the Fort de Rocher and 500 prisoners including 330 buccaneers and goods valued at approximately 160,000 pieces-of-eight.Konstam p.107 The Spanish burned the colony to the ground and slaughtered its inhabitants, leaving behind a fort manned by 150 soldiers.Harvey p.307 They possessed the island for about eighteen months, but on the approach of the expedition under Penn and Venerables were ordered by the Conde de Peñalva, Governor of Santo Domingo, to demolish the fortifications, bury the artillery and other arms, and retire to his aid in Hispaniola.Haring p.66 Background At midday, the French and English inhabitants of Tortuga sighted four Spanish vessels bearing down. This counterattack had been prompted by the buccaneers' sack of Santiago de los Caballeros, in 1650, and that of the Cuban port of San Juan de los Remedios in August 1652. Consequently, a punitive expedition had slipped out of the capital of Santo Domingo on 4 December 1653, bearing 200 soldiers and 500 volunteers under Captain Gabriel de Rojas y Figueroa, seconded by the former Irish renegade John Murphy (promoted to maestre de campo and invested with a knighthood in the Order of Santiago. This Spanish squadron had captured a trio of buccaneer craft off Monte Cristi before sighting Tortuga. Capture Gliding past its harbor, the Spaniards bombarded the vessels in the roads, then continued two or three miles farther down the coast and disembarked several hundred troops at the hamlet of Cayonne, marching back to besiege the island's principal fortress. On the night of 12 February, Rojas sent a company with grappling lines to scale the heights behind the keep and install siege artillery. Map of Tortuga (17th century) The buccaneer fort was built by a skilled French engineer on a rocky hill which dominated the island harbour of Cayenne. By 18 February the French and English requested terms and two days later the Chavalier de Fontenay decided to surrender. More than 500 captives were captured, among them 330 boucaniers. All were allowed to sail to France aboard a pair of ships under de Fontenay and Tibaut and Martin, respectively—with the exception of two leaders who were kept as hostages; the Spanish seized 70 cannons in the fortress and shore batteries, three ships, a frigate, and eight lesser craft as booty. These attackers also decided to hold their hard-won conquest by leaving behind a garrison of one hundred men under the Irish-born Murphy. Aftermath The prisoners were shipped to Santo Domingo and would become slaves on Spanish plantations. Hoping that the Spanish had abandoned the island, three buccaneer ships returned in August, but found that the Spaniards had already installed a garrison. However, coinciding with the English invasion of Hispaniola, on 13 September 1654 Spanish governor issued a real cédula ordering the withdrawal from Tortuga after first throwing down its fortifications.Konstam p.63Marley p.130 Tortuga was reoccupied the next year by English and French interlopers under Elias Watts, who secured a commission from Col. William Brayne, acting as military Governor on Jamaica, to serve as \\"Governor\\" of Tortuga.  Notes   References  * David F. Marley.

The Café Novelty (Coffeehouse Novelty) is the oldest café in the city of Salamanca (Spain), which was founded in 1905 and is situated in the main square of the city, Plaza Mayor de Salamanca. Its first owners were the García brothers. From the beginning of the Spanish Civil War to 1964 it was named Café Nacional. It was 4 times bigger than it is nowadays and it very soon became a favorite meeting place for writers, artists and politicians, due to its privileged position in the city. The most outstanding patrons of the Café Novelty are Miguel de Unamuno, the Spanish philosopher that organized the literary social gathering (tertulia), Ortega y Gasset, Antonio Tovar, Juan Benet, Pedro Laín Entralgo, Francisco Umbral, Carmen Martín Gaite, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester and Víctor García de la Concha. At its tables, in 1923, Dionisio Ridruejo decided to found the Football Club of Salamanca, and also the Spanish National Radio, between 1936 and 1937. From 1999, with the help of the members of the cultural society of Salamanca, a magazine of the café, \\"Los papeles del Novelty\\", has been published. History of Café The Presentation of the sculpture in honour of Gonzalo Torrente Ballester in the Café Novelty in 2000. From the right to the left, the director of The Royal Spanish Academy Víctor García de la Concha, the widow of Torrente, the author Carlos Casares and the sculptor Fernando Mayoral. Its first owners were Vicente and Federico García Martín. The interior of the Café occupied a space 4 times bigger than it has today. It had billiard tables, a restaurant, and a dance pavilion with colored atrium. One enters the salons of the Café through a revolving brass door that exemplifies the chic detail of the interior. To the right of the entrance usually united merchants, stock- breeders, manufacturers and rightists participate in the daily tertulia, and to the left, liberals, medics, lawyers and professors of the university etc. take seat. In the round salon with glass colored ceiling once played an orchestra and there were organized many luxurious weddings, and visitors liked to dance there. At the table of Café Novelty, in 1923, was signed the resolution of foundation of Football Club of Salamanca. Up until the Spanish civil war Café Novelty had a luxury, splendid life and proof of the special role of the Café at that time was an incognito dinner organized for the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII. During the Spanish Civil war the clientele of Café were divided, as was the country. Some people such as Gil Robles were in exile, others such as Maurin were executed by shooting. Miguel de Unamuno, who used to visit the terrace of Café, took shelter in street of Bordadores and died some months later. But the main contingent of visitors rose in joining the \\"band\\" of General Franco, as did the rest of the city The intellectual section of this \\"band\\" was often made the centre of promotion and publication in Café Novelty after the new government was placed in Salamanca. The name was changed to Café National until 1964. Laín Entralgo, Dionisio Ridruejo, Agustín de Foxá founded the Spanish National Radio between 1936 and 1937 in the tables of the Café. = From 1950s till 1970s= During some years in the 1950s–1960s, the owner of the café was D. Aureliano, an elegant merchant that had suspicious business in Tanger. He sold the café to D. Agustin Dominguez, the grandfather of the present owners. During the epoch of decadence in 1963 the restaurant was closed and the famous wine depository (bodega) was shut down. In 1964 the son of Agustin Francisco began to manage the café, renovated it in the style of the epoch and gave back the original name, which has not changed since. In the beginning of the 1970s it was repaired again and decorated with corner sofas. The café turned into a centre of political secrecy, often opposed to the ideology of Franco, and in its remote salons were held reunions to write manifestos and to hide duplicating machines. In 1978 the city hall of Salamanca, which was the owner of the real estate, proposed the necessity of confiscation of certain premises, and after the trial on 1 April, the café was closed. But after difficult negotiations and the gift of a one-third part of the building to the city hall (which was used for its offices) the café was once again opened in 1979 and redecorated by Salvador Yáñez. =From the 1980s= From the 1980s until now it recovered its bygone splendor as has the University of Salamanca and the city. The 25 years that Gonzalo Torrente Ballester enjoyed in the city and frequenting the café, helped to return the real position of Café Novelty to a position of meaningful influence in the cultural life. The trace of the writer in Café was so significant that in 2000 one monument was inaugurated in memory of the Spanish professor and author. It is a statue sited in his favorite corner of Café made by one friend of the writer' sculptor Fernando Mayoral.

Career =Club= Csoknyai started his career by his hometown club Dunaferr SE in 1983, and except a short spell at Honvéd Szondi SE he stayed until 1990. Dunaferr was a yo-yo club that period and Csoknyai has experienced three relegations (1984, 1986, 1989) and three promotions (1983, 1985, 1987) during his time at the club. Despite playing for a struggling team, his impressive display have convinced KC Veszprém of being a quality player, and the Transdanubians have moved on to sign the back player. Csoknyai spent fifteen seasons with Veszprém and played a major role in the success story of the team, that have gained near total domination in domestic competitions and also became a top club on continental level. He has won twelve Hungarian championship and as many Hungarian cup titles in these years, completing his collection with an EHF Cup Winners' Cup gold medal. In 2002, he was close to take the most prestigious continental event, the EHF Champions League trophy as well, but Veszprém fell short to SC Magdeburg in the finals. Three years later, at the age of 40, he finally gave up playing professional handball. He has hold the record of most domestic league and cup titles and most league and continental competition matches amongst the Hungarian players when retired. Csoknyai did not stay away entirely from the sport, as he took the assistant coach position of Veszprém after his retirement. In 2014 Csoknyai became the head coach of Balatonfüredi KSE, an affiliate team of Veszprém, and took a number of youngsters with him. From September 2009 to July 2010 he also worked as the head coach of the Hungarian men's national handball team, but under his guidance the team did not perform as it was expected and achieved only a disappointing fourteenth place on the 2010 European Championship. In 2018, he was appointed again as the coach of the Hungarian national team along with Vladan Matić. =International= Csoknyai, who has been capped 170 times for Hungary, made his international debut on 13 June 1991 against Austria. He participated on the 1992 Summer Olympics a year later, where he played on five games and scored six goals. He took part on three World Championships (1993, 1997, 1999), capturing the best result in 1997 by finishing fourth. Csoknyai was also present on the European Championship three times in row between 1994 and 1998, achieving a seventh, a tenth and a sixth place, respectively. He has ended his long international career on 6 June 2004 with a match against Norway.

Li Yangbing is notable for being the initial editor and compiler of the poetry of his kinsman, Li Bai; also for writing a preface to this which is important as one of the few primary historical sources on Li Bai. Li Yangbing was from Zhaojun, or the Zhao Administrative District, which is now Zhao County, in the Province of Hebei, China. His first government position was as an official in Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province. In 755, An Lushan declared himself Emperor, fielding military forces against the current Emperor, Xuanzong. In the ensuing eight years of the disorders, largely conducted under Generals An Lushan and Shi Siming, death and famine stalked the Central Plain of China, and the population decreased by the tens-of-millions. By 762, the imperial troops had retaken both sides of the Yellow River (most of Hebei and Henan), the rebels were mostly dead and the remnants beleaguered; and, on May 18, Daizong acceded to the throne as Emperor. In Daizong's first year, Li Yangbing, having succeeded in his career despite the sociopolitical turmoil, was still a powerful government officer, and accordingly was in Baoying County, Jiangsu Province. In the meantime, things had not gone so well for Li Yangbing's close relative, the famous poet and former court favorite, Li Bai; who, in fact, had gotten on quite the wrong side of things politically, and who, narrowly escaping the death sentence, condemned and en route to exile, then was reprieved – all due to the intervention of leading Tang General Guo Ziyi. Looking for a place of refuge, Li Bai headed for Dangtu, on the southern bank of the Yangzi River (now part of Ma'anshan, in today's Anhui Province), where his relative Li Yangbing was now governor. (Li Yangbing was probably Li Bai's father's younger brother.) When his famous relative Li Bai arrived in Dangtu, in his skiff, Li Yangbing was the chief magistrate there; although this governmental service was not what his \\"heart coveted\\",Obata, 202-203 (quoting/translating Li Yangbing's preface to Li Bo's works) and nearing retirement. Li Bai, older than Li Yangbing, became progressively sick, to the point of being a bed-ridden invalid. Already near retirement, Li Yangbing visited Li Bai on his death bed, where he was entrusted with the care of Li Bai's hastily scrawled and disorganized poetry manuscripts. Li Yangbing was able to use his literary and calligraphic talents, together with the extra time available by his retirement, to prepare the first corpus of collected Li Bai poetry; despite that, according to Li Yangbing, out of the eight years of the An Shi Rebellion turmoil, Li Bai's \\"writings of those years were lost, nine out of ten. What are preserved ... are for the most part what I obtained from others.\\"Obata, 203 (quoting/translating Li Yangbing from his preface to Li Bo's works) Li Yangbing's diligence in collecting, editing, and publishing Li Bai's poems would eventually lead to the first collected works of Li Bai's poems, with results which would resound through the literary world through the centuries, and which re-echo even through the present day.

Firearm maintenance (or gun care for short) is a series of periodic preventive maintenance procedures aiming to ensure the proper function of a firearm, often with the use of a variety of specialized tools and chemical solutions. Typically such maintenance is performed by the owner of the firearm using either simple methods such as cleaning the firearm with oil or other cleaning solutions, or more sophisticated practices such as lubricating moving parts with oil/grease and recoating exposed surfaces with protective finishes such as varnishing or bluing. When a firearm presents with physical damage related to the ordinary use of the firearm, or when a firearm malfunctions in a life-threatening manner, a professional gunsmith should perform advanced maintenance to determine if the firearm is repairable and/or safe to shoot anymore.  Necessity  An inadequately maintained firearm will often accumulate excessive fouling and dirt within the barrel and receiver, which not only can clog up the rifling and decrease the firearm's accuracy and precision, but can also interfere with the proper operation of the action and lead to potentially dangerous malfunctions. Furthermore, some of the foulings and dirts are either corrosive themselves, or capable of making the firearm vulnerable to rusting and wears, and thus can lead to irreversible damages to the firearm over time. The consequences of neglecting proper maintenance can be serious. For instance, during the Vietnam War, the newly issued M16A1 assault rifle was distributed to US troops with marketing literature from Colt Firearms claiming that the weapon was self-cleaning, which implied to many to mean that it did not have to be routinely maintained. However, this misapprehension compounded the rifle's design flaws and made the weapon notorious for repeated failures in combat, which led to needless casualties among US forces. Once the problem was acknowledged by the US military, the weapon was not only subject to upgrades, but US troops were also trained in proper maintenance of the weapon and supplied with cleaning kits and an illustrated booklet on the subject by Will Eisner.  Cleaning  The ordinary firing action releases fine particles of gunpowder, metals (mostly lead and copper from the bullet moving over the riflings) and other contaminates into the inner spaces of a firearm, which may cause malfunctions or in rarer cases of extreme buildup may raise the barrel pressure too high causing the firearm to explode (catastrophic failure) upon being fired. It has been widely reported that firearms without a spring to control the inertia of the firing pin require constant cleaning of the bolt assembly, as extremely dangerous phenomena such as slamfire may occur. Slamfire is a malfunction in which a firearm which is normally semi-automatic may temporarily and involuntarily become fully automatic, firing repeatedly — without another pull of the trigger — until the firearm is out of ammunition or jams. Every major firearms manufacturer provides detailed information on the proper methods used to disassemble, clean and then reassemble a firearm they produced. This information is usually packaged with the firearm. In the event that this information is not present with the firearm at the point of purchase, it is advisable to ask the manufacturer where this information may be obtained. For safety reasons the manufacturer's directions for cleaning, maintenance and care should always be followed. There are many different types of weapon and firearm cleaning kits available on for sale. These kits will give you the necessary tools and materials to properly clean your firearm safely and effectively. These kits help keep your firearm stay maintained and properly lubricated, making the firearm last longer without failure.  Lubrication  Firearms produce massive momentary forces upon firing a bullet. A typical 9mm projectile produces a maximum of of pressure in the instant of firing. The amount of pressure a firearm may endure for the first few milliseconds after the cartridge fires can be over 2,300 times more than the normal atmospheric pressure. Therefore, it is important for the safety of the shooter, and the longevity of a firearm that it is properly lubricated as per the manufacturer's specifications. When in an extreme and life-threatening situation such as preparing for combat, the manufacturer's recommended lubricants may not be available to soldiers, or others who may enter these scenarios. If there is time to perform firearm maintenance before a life- threatening emergency (such as daily cleaning of a rifle in a combat zone) it may become necessary to use other sources of lubrication, as a firearm will function better with some lubricant than it will with none. One United States Marine Corps sergeant recounts that synthetic motor oil performed better than standard military issued lubricant in extreme conditions. However it is advisable to immediately return to the standard recommendation of the firearm manufacturer when conditions allow.  Safety  It is critically important that a firearm is free of ammunition before beginning maintenance. The National Rifle Association teaches gun owners that \\"before cleaning your gun, make absolutely sure that it is unloaded. The gun's action should be open during the cleaning process. Also, be sure that no ammunition is present in the cleaning area\\". When reassembling a firearm after it has been cleaned, it is very important to know how to put the weapon back together properly. Failure to reassemble your firearm properly could lead to malfunction when firing and could lead to injury.

A 1656 engraving of a Plague doctor, by Paul Fürst. Niall Ó Glacáin may have worn such a costume while attending plague victims. Background Ó Glacáin's date of birth is uncertain. MacCuinneagáin believes him to be about ninety upon his death in 1653, giving a birth date of around 1563. Giorgio Scharpes of the Faculty of Medicine, Bologna from 1634 to 1637, believed him to be about 48 during one of those years, giving a birth year of c. 1575. He was born in Tír Chonaill, and may have received his early medical education from a local hereditary family of physicians such as the Mac Duinnshléibhe family of Tír Chonaill. At the time, such families were the only source of medical training in Ireland. Spain and France Ó Glacáin made his way to Spain sometime before 1600, possibly in time to treat victims of an outbreak of the bubonic plague which was rampant from 1595 to 1602. He was at the Spanish court when Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill arrived in Spain, and may have attended him upon his death in 1602. Ó Glacáin subsequently spent many years practising medicine in Salamanca. In 1622 he moved to Valencia, residing there for two years. In 1627 he moved to France during an outbreak of the plague, working as a Plague doctor in towns such as Fons, Figeac, Capdenac, Cajarc, Rovergue and Floyeac. Toulouse and Paris He had settled in Toulouse in time to treat victims of the outbreak of 1628. MacCuinneagáin states that Ó Glacáin \\"gained high esteem and general consideration because of the devotion which he showed in braving the contagion to succor the sick. He was appointed physician at the xenodochium pestiferorum, the plague hospital at Toulouse in 1628 and was appointed to the University there with the title Premier Professor of Medicine. He spent some time in Paris as physician to King Louis XIII and was also a Privy Councillor there.\\" Tractatus de Peste By now a respected authority on plague treatment, he published his most famous work, Tractatus de Peste, at Toulouse in 1629. It contained his conscise descriptions of the plague, its various effects on different patients such as buboes, rashes, headaches, vomiting and coma. Suggested treatments including bleeding, the use of clysters, purgatives and fumigation. An especially interesting part of the text is a description of four post-mortems which he carried out, where he noted the occurrence of petechial haemorrhages which \\"covered the surface of the victims' lungs and also the swelling of the spleen.\\" A Pioneer of Pathological anatomy Ó Glacáin was a pioneer in pathological anatomy, with his work predateing that of Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) by several decades. In Italy Ó Glacáin moved to Italy in the early 1630s, where his services were sought by The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bologna, which had a tradition of employing very eminent foreign doctors teaching Medicina Sopraordinaria. To this end, the city senate asked the then M.S., Giorgio Scharpes (Medicina Sopraordinaria from 1634 to 1637) write up a report on the Irishman, whose fame by now spanned all of Europe. Scharpes reply was as follows: \\"With regard to religion Mr. Glacáin is a Catholic, and there is no doubt because it would be difficult for a heretic to live in a city like Tolosa (Toulouse) which is known to be one of the most Catholic places and where they cannot bear heretics. Mr. Glacáin is about 48. He is famous because during the plague in these regions of France during the years 1627 to 1629 he was very helpful and in the year 1629 he produced a book titled Tractus de Peste ... and I invite you to read this book to understand exactly why Mr. Glacáin is valuable and why he is still teaching in the University of Tolosa ... About his teaching he is well estimated because he is a good philosopher, good in fighting against his enemies that accused him of being a magician; his book can confirm that he was not a magician ... Mr. Glacáin knows Greek very well ... talking about the other questions ... from a letter from Mr. Glacáin where he says he would really like to serve the University of Bologna, I can understand that there will not be any problem for the salary and for him to come.\\" Ó Glacáin became Professor of Medicina Theorica Soparodinaria at Bologna in 1642, an office he held till his death eleven years later. Cursus Medicus During his years in Bologna, Niall Ó Glacáin wrote his Cursus Medicus (Medicine lessons), which appeared in three volumes; the first dealt with physiology, the second pathology, and the third – which appeared after his death – on the theory of signs. This final volume dealt with the different diagnosis by doctors, descriptions of diseases, and was overall an introduction to the modern concept of differential diagnosis. Two other Irishmen resident in the city, Gregory Fallon of Connacht and the Rev. Phillip Roche, S.J., wrote commendatory verses prefixing volume two. Personal life Niall Ó Glacáin's personal life is almost unknown, but he did entertain Bishop of Ferns Nicholas French and Sir Nicholas Plunkett at his home in Bologna, when the latter were on their way to Rome in 1648. In collaboration with them he wrote eulogistic poems in Latin to Innocent X, titled Regni Hiberniae ad Sanctissimi Innocenti Pont. Max. Pyramides Encomiasticae. In his later work he mentions another friend, the Franciscan catechist and grammarian, Fr. Froinsias Ó Maolmhuaidh.

She graduated from the City College of New York in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in education and subsequently took art and photography classes there. Joseph took photographs during her travels in Europe and North Africa, only to return to New York City, where she specialized in black-and-white images. Shortly after winning the grand prize in a photo competition run by the Saturday Review in 1963, Joseph returned to Europe. She also won the Purchase Award from the Concord Community Arts Department of the National Photography Competition. Joseph relocated to San Francisco in 1970, where she mainly took color photographs of the local architecture and drag queens. In 1991, she provided all the illustrations for Details: The Architect's Art, an art book by Sally Byrne Woodbridge that analyzes the decorative details of San Francisco buildings from the Victorian period to the 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Joseph's photographs were exhibited at the San Francisco Art Institute, the UCR/California Museum of Photography, Stanford University's Iris & B.

Two traditions of public science have emerged, one based on participatory action research and another based on science outreach. Participatory action research Participatory action research in Ghana The participatory action research approach seeks to develop a critical framework for making systematic inquiry and analysis a public enterprise. It is committed to valuing knowledges that have been historically marginalized and delegitimized (i.e., youth, prisoner, immigrant, farmer) alongside traditionally recognized knowledges (i.e., scholarly). Through the formation of research collectives, it aims to share the various knowledges and resources held by its individual members so members can participate as equally as possible. The choice of appropriate research questions, design, methods and analysis as well as useful research products are decided collectively. Institutions for this form of public science include the Public Science Project. Examples of public science projects in the participatory action research tradition include the Morris Justice Project. Science outreach Prospect Park inviting passersby to use his telescope and talk about an astronomical phenomenon. The science outreach approach has some similarities to citizen science but typically describes projects that are conducted outdoors or in another type of public or accessible space such as a public park, metro stop, library, university campus, etc.Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M. (September 2011), \\"Creating Public Science with the From Earth to the Universe Project\\". Science Communication, 33(3). Similar to public art, it includes aspects of collaboration, community support and involvement, and site specificity.Watzke, M., Arcand, K.K., \\"The Universe Brought Down to the Streets: The \\"From Earth to the Universe\\" Project\\". Mercury magazine, 39(1), Spring 2010. Public science efforts in the science outreach tradition include Science on the Buses, in which city buses in many major European Union cities were decorated with large informational science posters in November 2002. Likewise, a project in Toronto placed \\"advertisements\\" with science facts on buses in Toronto during July 2009. Science City was a public science initiative that ran from June 1994 through May 1995. Created by staff and consultants from the New York Hall of Science, Science City was an outdoor exhibition that utilized the street, fences, buildings and other public structures in New York City to attract the \\"non-museum-going\\" public to the science in everyday life.Cole, P.R. & Cutting, J.M., 1996, \\"The Inside Story of Science City: An Outdoor Public Science Exhibition\\". Curator: The Museum Journal. Volume 39 #4, p. 245–261. The exhibition asked questions such as \\"Why is it warmer in the city?\\", \\"What pulses under the street?\\" and \\"What's under the sidewalk?\\" to help increase public awareness about the science and technology that runs invisibly underneath modern urban life. Science Cafés, founded by the public science pioneer Duncan Dallas, are public science events that initiate a discussion on a science topic in pubs or cafes, usually with a local researcher in attendance to answer questions and present information. Science festivals can also be grouped into this category of public science efforts, with modern incarnations of festivals including a range of learner- centered activities and events conducted in public spaces. Public science initiatives often attempt to reach new audiences (particularly, non-experts who might not actively seek out science), in addition to existing science outreach audiences, by hosting events in alternative informal learning environments.Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A. W., Feder, M. A. (Eds), 2009, Learning Science in Informal Environments: People, Places and Pursuits. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. By definition, such public science projects are outside the walls of the science centre or science museum, where the main focus of the particular space is not typically science outreach.Norsted, B. A., 2010, \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game: Science Outreach to Non-traditional Audiences\\". Science Education and Outreach: Forging a Path to the Future. ASP Conference Series, Vol. 431, p. 170–173.

(Eds.), 2010 \\"International Year of Astronomy 2009 Final Report\\" International Astronomical Union, FETTU displayed large-scale images of astronomical objects with contextual information and supplementary materials and activities in non-traditional and mostly public locations such as parks, airports, art festivals, and shopping malls.

Name In ancient Turkic lexicon, the meaning of \\"skewbald\\" (horse) is expressed with the terms \\"ala\\" or \\"alagchin\\" still active now in composite expressions. Tang Huiyao mentioned, right after the Ashina tribe, a tribe named Geluozhi[ya] (葛羅枝[牙]) (Middle Chinese ZS: *kɑt̚-lɑ-t͡ɕiᴇ[-ŋˠa]), whose tamga is depicted as File:AlachinGe-lo- chji27Zuev.gif.Zuev Yu.A., \\"Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms (translation of Chinese composition \\"Tanghuiyao\\" of the 8th to 10th centuries)\\", Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences, Alma-Ata, 1960, pp. 124, 132 (in Russian).

During the Tang period, Chinese chroniclers calqued the ethonym Alat as Boma \\"skewbald horses\\".Zuev Yu.A., \\"Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms\\", p. 124 Elsewhere, Zuev stated that \\"Sometimes the tribal name 曷剌 Hela (< ɣа-lât < *alat < *ala-at \\"skewbald horse\\") is written down with hieroglyphs 賀賴 Helai (ɣâ-lâi < alai), which is equivalent to 賀蘭 Helan (< alan ~ ala \\"skewbald, motley, mixed\\").Zuev, Yu. \\"Xueyantuo Khaganate and Kimeks: Turkic ethnogeography of the Central Asia in the middle of 7th century\\" Shygys, No 1, pp. 11-21, No 2, pp. 3-26 (2004) Oriental Studies Institute, Almaty Chinese transcribers also preserved many similar titles, individual and tribal names in Xianbei society, where horses were held in high esteem: # tribal name Helan (賀蘭); # individual names: such as Xiongnu Shanyu Helaitou (賀賴頭); Tuyuhun prince Helutou (賀虜頭); Tiefu Xiongnu chief Liuhu's second son Eloutou (閼陋頭); Northern Wei general Gao Huan's Xianbei name Heliuhun (賀六渾), Aliutou (阿六頭), Heliutou (賀六頭); # the title Helazhen 賀剌真 (recorded in Nanqishu) of bodyguards (三郎 sānlāng) serving Northern Wei emperors in the 5th century. According to Peter A. Boodberg the title Helazhen transcribes \\"undoubtedly *atlačin 'horseman' from Tk. atla 'to mount a horse'\\", thus \\"a purely Turkish form in T'o-pa\\". All of those foresaid names & titles are traceable back to Turkic or Turco-Mongol *atlan \\"to ride\\" < *at- \\"horse\\", whereas *ala- *alaɣ-, or *alutu means \\"variegated\\", \\"dappled\\", or \\"piebald\\", thus describing the preferred coat-color(s) of nomadic northerners' warhorses.Mueller, Shing. \\"Horses of the Xianbei: 300-600 AD A Brief Survey\\", in Pferde in Asien: Geschichte, Handel, und Kultur, (2009). p. 189-190 The ethnonym Alat might have been Arabicized as Khalaj or Qalaj in Persian, Arabic and Bactrian sources, corresponding to 訶(達)羅支 He(da)luozhi (< *ha-(dat-)la-tɕĭe) or 葛(達)羅支 Ge(da)luozhi (< *kat-(dat-)la-tɕĭe), which in turn are variants of 葛羅支 Geluozhi. According to New Book of Tang (vol. 217), Boma 駁馬 ~ Bila 弊剌 ~Eluozhi 遏羅支 neighboured the Jiegu 結骨 (i.e. Yenisei Kyrgyz). Arab geographer al-Idrisi recorded that the Khalajes' winter quarter and castle were situated near the Kimeks, who in turn dwelt in the Irtysh basin, to the north and/or west of the Kirghizes. Thus, based on geographic arrangements, the Boma ~ Bila ~ Eluozhi (i.e. Alats) might be the same as Khalajes. Tongdian glossed Helan as simply \\"horse\\" in Old TurkicDu You.

Based on annalistic traditions, the author of the \\"Family tree of Türks\\" Abulgazi described the country of skewbald horses: : \\"A multitude of Tatar tribes coached along the banks of the Angara-muren, which runs east of the Kirgiz country and runs into the sea. On the seacoast at the estuary of this river is a large city surrounded by settlements where live nomadic tribes in large numbers. Their horses are large... All of them are skewbald in hue, there are no others. Near that city called Alakchin was a silver spring, therefore all caldrons, dishes, and vases were from silver. It is that country that the Uzbeks mean when say: \\"there is a country where all horses are skewbald, and the stoves are from gold\\". The Khaljī tribe had long been settled in Afghanistan.Khalji Dynasty. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2010. 23 August 2010. A Khalji dynasty of Turkic Khalaj origin ruled large parts of South Asia from 1290 to 1320, they were the second Muslim dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate of India, they are noted in history for repeatedly defeating the warring Mongols and thereby saving India from plundering raids and attacks. =Modern time= After the Russian revolution in 1917, Alats (Kazakh: Alaş), named after a legendary founder of the Kazakh people, headed a movement of the Turkestan peoples for independence, and created a functioning state of the Kazakh people known as Alash Autonomy that operated between December 13, 1917, and August 26, 1920, controlling roughly the territory of the present-day Republic of Kazakhstan, with a capital in Alash-qala (modern Semey). The Alash leaders in December 1917 proclaimed establishment of Alash Orda, a Kazakh government, aligned with the Russian White Army and fought against the Bolsheviks. In 1919, when the White forces were losing, Alash Autonomous government began negotiations with the Bolsheviks. In 1919–20 Bolsheviks defeated the White Russian forces in the region and occupied Kazakhstan. On August 26, 1920, the new Soviet government disbanded the Alash Autonomy, and established the \\"Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\", later the name was changed in 1925 to \\"Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\\" and changed again in 1936 to \\"Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic\\". However, the movement for independence continued, and it continued until 1925, when the war for independence was finally extinguished Modern demographics The historical Alats' descendants now live in China, Russia in the Altai, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, the Caucasus, eastern section of the Iranian plateau; as well as possibly Turkmenistan, India, and Afghanistan, if Alats were indeed the Khalajes known in Bactrian inscriptions and to medieval Arab and Persians geographers. Helan tribe members who migrated to China changed their surname to Hè (trad. 賀; simp. 贺) and would eventually become assimilated into Han Chinese. Alats are also the main ethnic component in the Kazakh Junior-Kishi Zhuz and constitute parts of Uzbeks. Further west, Alats constitute one Oghuz Turkish tribe, Ulayundluğ in Turkish and Alayuntluq in Azeri, which means \\"with spotted horses\\". Ulanyundluğ's descendants live in Central Turkey. Ulayundluğ participated in the ethnogenesis of Azeris, as Ulayundluğ tamgas have been found in historical residences of Azeris in Georgia, Armenia, and the modern Republic of Azerbaijan.Ibrahimov, T. (2019) Traces of the Oghuz Tribe Ulayundlug/Ala Yundlu (Ala Atly - with pinto horses) in Azerbaijan The Halaç District in Lebap Province in Turkmenistan was named after Khalajes. As of 2000, approximately 42,000 speakers of the Khalaj language lived in Iran, per ISO 639-3 their language is called Turkic Khalaj, to distinguish it from the Indo-Iranian \\"Khalaj\\" language. In the Caucasus, in Armenia and Azerbaijan are a number of settlements with the name ascending to the Alats; they also are in Uzbekistan and Tatarstan, and in the form Kalat in Khorasan. In Afghanistan, the Ghilzais are the largest Pashtun tribes and pasturing at the Ghazni plateau. In India, Alats are called Ghalzae. In Khorasan, Alats are called Kalat.

The band signed to Polydor Records, emerging as part of the new wave of British heavy metal scene. Stampede disbanded in 1983, and guitarist Laurence Archer went on to play with UFO, Phil Lynott's Grand Slam amongst other projects. The band reformed 26 years later in 2009, and a new studio album titled 'A Sudden Impulse' was released on 9 May 2011 on the Grind That Axe label, a subsidiary of Rock Candy Records. History =Pre-Stampede (Lautrec, Lionheart & Wild Horses)= Stampede emerged from the partnership of Reuben Archer (vocalist, songwriter) and stepson Laurence Archer (guitarist, songwriter). Their first major project being the 1977 hard rock band Lautrec, for which they recruited Steve Holbrook of Frome on keyboards, and Simon Riddler of Shepton Mallet on bass. The drummer was Clive Deamer of Frome, who later played in Portishead and Robert Plant's Strange Sensation, as well as session work for many other important projects. Prior to a Saxon support tour, Deamer left to finish an apprenticeship and was replaced by Steve Jones. The band completed two support tours with Saxon and released a single on the Street Tunes Label: \\"Shoot Out the Lights\\" / \\"Mean Gasoline\\", now reputed to be one of the rarest 45s of the NWOBHM era.MacMillan, Malc. The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia. P Verlag,16 Nov 2001 auctioning on eBay for £1800. In 1980, with no major deal in place, Reuben joined Lionheart, a new supergroup headed by ex-Iron Maiden guitarist Dennis Stratton. Within 4 months with no record deal in the offing, Reuben took the offer to join Wild Horses with Jimmy Bain, late of Rainbow. The band required a guitarist to partner John Lockton and a new drummer, so Reuben suggested Laurence Archer on guitar and Frank Noon of Lionheart on drums. This completed the final line-up of Wild Horses. However, the project never took off and a disillusioned Reuben, Laurence and Frank left to form Stampede. They recruited Alan Nelson (ex-Wildfire) on keyboards and Bristol-based bass player Colin Bond (formerly of Stormtrooper) to complete the original Stampede line- up. =Stampede (1981–1983)= Days of Wine & Roses EP and The Official Bootleg (1981–1982) Under management from Roulette Music and with an advance from Polydor Records, Stampede went into Cave Studios in Bristol to record 6 tracks. The tracks were taken up by Polydor Records who consequently signed the band in 1981 for a major deal, immediately releasing four of the new tracks on an EP called Days of Wine and Roses. The band continued to play residencies at the London Marquee Club and various other venues in and around London, and were booked for the Mildenhall and Reading Festivals of 1982. Before these festival dates, drummer Frank Noon left Stampede to join Bernie Tormé, and was replaced by Bristol-based Eddie Parsons who stayed with the band until the end. Prior to the Festivals, Reuben broke his hip and left thigh running to catch a bus with Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, and only just made it out of hospital to appear onstage at the festivals on crutches. Prior to the Mildenhall Festival, Stampede decided to remain a four piece when keyboardist Alan Nelson left to pursue other things. It was felt that Bond’s bass style and Taurus pedals more than filled out the sound, and that’s how the band remained until their demise. Polydor recorded the Mildenhall and Reading Festival sets of 1982 putting the live album out as Stampede: The Official Bootleg. Between 1982 and 1983 Stampede also recorded a BBC show for Tommy Vance, a Capital Radio show with 4 tracks for Fluff Freeman's Rock Show, and a BBC In Concert show at the Paris Theatre with contemporaries Girlschool. Hurricane Town and \\"The Other Side\\" (1983) In 1983, Stampede followed up the Official Bootleg with a studio album, entitled Hurricane Town, recruiting Magnum's Mark Stanway for keyboard duties. At this time Polydor also released a 7\\" single called \\"The Other Side\\". Hurricane Town was promoted by a support tour with Gary Moore, before which the band went off to Portugal to play a week’s residency as warm up for the tour, which was extended after the Christmas of 1983. Disbandment After Hurricane Town a second studio album was scheduled and Stampede commenced writing material, however, when singer Reuben returned to hospital to have all the metalwork removed from his hip and thigh, he caught a virus during the op and became seriously ill. Due to this and the fact that rock and metal were having a hard time due to the onslaught of Punk and New wave, plus with little support from Polydor, Stampede decided to split. Reuben formed his own design company and Colin Bond went off to work with Meat Loaf, while Laurence joined Phil Lynott and Mark Stanway in Grand Slam. When Lynott died Laurence joined Brit rockers UFO, before retiring from music to work in the film industry. Reunion In 2006 Rock Candy Records re-released Stampede's last studio offering Hurricane Town (originally released by Polydor Records in 1983). The album consisted of all the original tracks re-mastered, and four bonus tracks from the Lautec catalogue, and featured a 16-page colour booklet with sleevenotes by journalists Malcolm Dome, Dante Bonutto and Derek Oliver, along with a foreword by Reuben Archer. On 2 January 2009, Reuben called Colin Bond and Laurence Archer with a view to reunite Stampede, and the first gig was staged at London's Embassy Club in Mayfair on 25 May 2009. After several gigs they made the unanimous decision to commence recording a new album. This was easier said than done as it soon transpired that the availability of each band member was impossible to schedule, and when Laurence became unavailable during a period in the recording schedule due to work commitments, Reuben brought in guitarists Rob Wolverson and Chris Clowsley to finish the job. Laurence and Reuben had written and recorded 5 tracks and Reuben with Rob and Chris along with original bassist Colin Bond and new drummer Steve Graystone completed the album.Stampede Official Press Pack, May 2011 The album, entitled A Sudden Impulse was recorded at Track 21 Studios in Weston-super-Mare, Dartington Hall Studios in Devon, and Mad Hat Studios in Wolverhampton.sleevenotes, A Sudden Impulse.

History  Before April 1857 the East of Bridgeport Catholics were attended by the priests of St. James Church, first parish in the city and predecessor of St. Augustine’s. St. James was located at Washington Avenue and Arch Street and had been dedicated July 24, 1843 – 13 years after a missionary priest had first celebrated Mass in Bridgeport and several months before the Diocese of Hartford was created. At this time St. James had parish boundary lines including an area greater than today's Diocese of Bridgeport. Rev. Thomas J. Synott, third priest to serve St. James and second pastor, in 1854 decided to build the first St. Mary Church on Crescent and Church Streets where St. Cyril’s now stands. It was a white wooden frame church. Their first parishioners were from Ireland. In April 1857 St. Mary receives official status of parish and is assigned its first pastor, Rev. Peter A. Smith, who builds a rectory and serves the community for five years. The next eleven years the young parish was under the direction of Revs. Francis J. Lenihan (1862), Richard O’Gorman, Thomas Drea (1867). In 1869 the first church of Bridgeport, St. James, (established in 1842, one year before the establishment of the Dioceses of Hartford) is replaced with San Augustine Church. On July 6, 1873, Rev. John F. Rogers takes Rev. Drea place as pastor for the next 29 years. During his tenure as spiritual director, the parish grew into one of the most important parishes of the Hartford Diocese. In June 1874 Rev. Rogers began to build the red brick, Romanesque-style church. On May 16, 1875, the first cornerstone is placed and on October 14, 1877, Bishop Thomas Galberry, 4th Bishop of the Dioceses of Hartford, dedicates the new St. Mary. After the construction of the church Rev. Rogers converts the old little white wooden frame church into a St. Mary Private School with more than 200 children at a cost of $3 per month. It was the first catholic school in the city. Rev. Rogers brings the first order of nuns “Sisters of Mercy” to teach; they stayed as long as the school lasted. The cost of the construction was approximately $100,000. In 1881 Rogers built the rectory next to the church, and before the end of the century he renovated the interior of the church and purchased land for the building of a school and convent. Rogers, not in good health, turn over the projects to his administrator. In 1901 the cornerstone for the school, opposite the church, was laid. Rogers died in May 1902. Rev. William H. Lynch, as administrator, completed the school and convent and later opens a new church, St. Charles, and becomes its first pastor. In the early 1900s immigrants from Italy start coming in and the church became primarily an Italian parish. Rev. John F. Murphy, who was Rev. Rogers’s associate, returns as pastor in November 1902, and on April 19, 1917, Rev. Matthew J. Traynor is appointed pastor; together they built up a fully equipped parish plant. Priest M. Ernest Wilson arrived at St. Mary on September 18, 1924. He founded the Holy Name teams of Basketball and Baseball, which continued until WW II. He and the Waltersville School principal introduced the early dismissal of catholic students to attend religious classes. In the early 1920s Rev. Traynor had renewed the interior of the church and in October 1927, Rev. Wilson and his assistants started plans for the Golden Jubilee of the parish, but the church caught fire and was destroyed on the eve of the celebration. In rebuilding the church, Rev. Wilson introduced many changes, fireproof features were installed and the sanctuary enlarged. The spire was destroyed by the fire. Altars of choice Italian marble replaced the previous wooden altar The church was re-dedicated on June 24, 1928 by the 7th and 8th bishops of Hartford, John J. Nilan and Maurice McAuliff. During the depression, Rev. Wilson provided food and shelter for many families, many times providing from his personal means. The next pastor, Rev. Paul F. Keating, was to serve St. Mary during the Depression years 1930 34. He was succeeded by the Rev. Leo M. Finn who, shortly after arriving was to become Monsignor and capelin of the Knights of Columbus. In June 1939 Rev. James H. Killian became the 11th pastor of St. Mary; he died in February 1941. Rev. Michael J. Kearney came to St. Mary on March 28, 1941, as pastor and in his 13 years finishes the renovations and plans that Rev. Killian started, and later celebrated the Centennial. Immigrants from Puerto Rico came to the city. 1953 The Diocese of Bridgeport is established and the Monsignor Lawrence Shehan from Baltimore is named Bishop. Rev. Richard F. Dunn is assigned on May 20, 1954, as successor of Rev. Killian, but in October is transferred to Fairfield, being replaced by Rev. Bartholomew J. O’Shea, who was born in the parish,. The interior is renovated, and new stained glass windows installed. The lighting is improved. In 1956 Bishop Shehan assigns Revs. Francis Campagnone and Victor Torres Frías to start a Hispanic Apostolate in the Diocese. Rev. Victor Torres-Friás, the first Hispanic priest in the diocese, and Rev. Holbrook, later assigned to the parish, are ordained at St. Mary as part of the a957 centenary celebrations. In 1973 Rev. Torres- Friás is named secretary to Cardinal Aponte of Puerto Rico and Rev. J. Peter Cullen assumes the position of pastor. Due to economic reasons and after realizing the most of the students in the schools were non- catholic, in March 1973-74 the diocese consolidated the schools of St. Mary, St. Cyril and Blessed Sacrament. After evaluation of the three buildings it is decided that Blessed Sacrament School building is in the best conditions and needs less renovation. St. Cyril drops out and does not join St. Mary and Blessed Sacrament. The student cost at the time was approximately $100. In October 1975 Rev. Torres- Friás is named Monsignor. In June 1977 the Rev. Mr. Frank Wissel is assigned to St. Mary to work as a deacon and on September 10, 1977, is ordained priest. The Diocese, realizing the burden of Catholic Schools on parishes that are straggling, in September 1977 takes over the schools of Blessed Sacrament and St. Cyril and combines them, with tuition fees of approximately $175 per student. Rev. Cullen and the Parish Council decided in June 1975 to close the church during the day for security. During this year Rev. Holbrook is assigned to the parish as Rev. Cullen assistant. The financial position of the parish is not good; in 1979 the school building is sold to the city of Bridgeport for $155,970.12. Before the end of the year Rev. J. Peter Cullen is appointed to St. Peter Church in Bridgeport. Before the end of the twentieth century the Church is primarily Hispanic, with most parishioners coming from Puerto Rico. On Sunday, January 6, 1980, Rev. Matthew Bernelli is installed as pastor of St. Mary. Bernelli, fluent in Spanish, is a native of Mondavi, Cuneo, Italy. He was ordained in Rome in 1964. He spent nine years working in Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador and Mexico before going to the United States. A Somascan Priest he is accepted into the Diocese on June 5, 1974 and incardinated into Diocese, therefore relieving him of his Somacan duties on August 31, 1979. Before arriving at St. Mary he was assistant pastor at St. Raphael in Bridgeport, St. Joseph in South Norwalk and St. Ambrose in Bridgeport. The church had financial problems, including deterioration due to lack of maintenance over the years. After evaluation and consultation with the Parish Council it was found that building a new church was cheaper than renovating; plans are made. To avoid interrupting services the Parish Hall is converted to a temporary Church and Masses are started on November 16, 1980 while plans are made to demolish and rebuild the church. The old rectory is also rebuilt. In February 1981 Rev. Bernelli and his associate Rev. Francis Torras move into their new residence, 25 Sherman St. On March 28, 1982 Bishop Walter Curtis gives permission for the demolition of the old brick church, so long as half the cost of building the new church is raised beforehand. The stone of the church and the stained glass windows are preserved; what cannot be used in the new church is sold. In August 1982 Rev. Francis Torras who has been in the parish long before Rev. Bernelli arrived retires, and resident priest Rev. James Breen is appointed from 8/27/1982 to July 15, 1983. Also during this year the Spanish Apostolate celebrates its 25 Anniversary. Bernelli and his Building Committee arrange various festivals, dances, concerts, and raffles. The Rev. Paul F. Merry is appointed associate on April 26, 1985. A mosaic is installed.

Premise  he main focus of the line is Jack Sparrow and Will Turner as they rescue the kidnapped Elizabeth Swann from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Hector Barbossa, who become undead skeletons at night.  Characters  * Jack Sparrow: An eccentric pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures. He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. * Barbossa: The captain of the Black Pearl, he was Captain Jack Sparrow's first mate before he led a mutiny ten years before. He and his crew stole cursed Aztec gold, for which they are cursed to walk the earth forever. * Will Turner: A blacksmith's apprentice working in Port Royal, he is in love with Elizabeth Swann. Will struggles with the fact his father, \\"Bootstrap\\" Bill, was a pirate, unable to reconcile that he was a good man too. * Elizabeth Swann: The daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth has been fascinated with pirates since childhood.

She also is in love with Will Turner. * Norrington: An officer in the Royal Navy who is in love with Elizabeth and has a deep-seated dislike for pirates. * Joshamee Gibbs: Jack Sparrow's friend and first mate, he was once a sailor for the Royal Navy. He is usually the one who tells the legends of Jack Sparrow. * \\"Bootstrap Bill\\" Turner: A crewman aboard the Flying Dutchman who so happens to be Will Turner's father. He was cursed by the Aztec gold on Isla de Muerta (along with Hector Barbossa's crew). Thrown overboard after refusing to take part in the mutiny against Jack led by Barbossa, he spent years bound to a cannon beneath the crushing ocean. Found by Davy Jones, he swore to servitude aboard the Flying Dutchman crew and escaped death. * Davy Jones: Captain of the Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones was once a human being. Unable to bear the pain of losing his true love, he carved out his heart and put it into the Dead Man's Chest, then buried it in a secret location. He has become a bizarre creature - part octopus, part crab, part man - and collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years. * Blackbeard: Legendary pirate, and captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge. * Angelica: Jack's former love interest, and daughter of Blackbeard. * Captain Armando Salazar: The undead Captain of the Silent Mary who seeks revenge on Jack Sparrow and attempts to steal the Trident of Poseidon to kill every pirate at sea. Bardem set out to imbue the character with \\"a rage based on dented pride,\\" owing to his spectacular fall, from a high-ranking commander of a Spanish fleet to being betrayed and trapped in hell by Jack. With Salazar's body language, he tried to convey a bull in an arena, \\"full of rage and need of vengeance, but also wounded.\\"  Sets  The first main release included eight sets.

FMBI offers training courses for ministers and Christian workers. Currently, the school offers many courses in Christian education and theology including Biblical language courses. FMBI's current president is also Pastor of the First Missionary Baptist Church in Fresno, Dr. David M. Butimore Sr. What FMBI Believes * Concerning the Scriptures: We believe in the plenary verbal inspiration and infallibility of the whole Bible, and that it is the all-sufficient rule of faith and practice. (11 Timothy 3: 16,17) * Concerning God: We believe in a personal God eternally existent in three Divine Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19) * Concerning Creation: We believe in the Genesis account of creation (Genesis 1:1-31), and that all things exist as objects of the creative power of God. * Concerning the Virgin Birth: We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Son of man; He is the only Savior of men-, He was born of a virgin, and He is the only Mediator between God and man. (Matthew 1:18-25, 1 Timothy 2-.5) * Concerning the Deity: We believe in the Deity of Jesus Christ. (John 10:30) * Concerning Sacrifice and Suffering: We believe the suffering and death of Jesus to be substitutionary and vicarious. (Hebrews 2:9; 1 Peter 2:24) * Concerning the Resurrection: We believe the bodily resurrection and ascension of Jesus, the bodily resurrection of His Saints (I Corinthians 15); the second coming of Jesus Christ, both personal and bodily, are the crowning events of this Gentile age. (Acts I.-I 1) He will set up His Kingdom on earth and rule upon the earth for 1000 years. (Revelation 20:6) * Concerning Eternal Punishment: We believe in an eternal place of punishment for those who reject Christ as Savior. (Luke 16:19-31; Revelation 20;15) * Concerning the Church: We believe a scriptural church is a visible assembly of baptized believers, covenanted together under New Testament law for the purpose of carrying out the Great Commission, with an unbroken history from the personal ministry of Jesus on earth to this present day * Concerning the Great Commission: We hold what true Baptists have ever held: that the Great Commission was given to the churches only; that in Kingdom activities the Church is the only unit in associated work; that each Church should exercise equal authority; and that the Churches should meet their responsibilities according to their several abilities. * Concerning Cooperating Bodies: We believe that all cooperating bodies, such as associations, conventions, boards, committees, etc., are and properly should be the servants of the Churches. (Matthew 20:25-28) * Concerning Scriptural Baptism: We believe that scriptural baptism is immersion in water of a born-again believer by the authority of a scriptural Baptist church. We reject the baptism of institutions with human origin. We further believe that baptism is symbolic of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and, in likeness, it is typical of the burial and resurrection of the believer. (Roman 6:4-6; Matthew 28:19-20; Matthew 3:13-17) * Concerning the Lord's Supper. We believe that the Lord's Supper is a memorial ordinance restricted to faithful members of a given local church. (I Corinthians 11:20-34) * Concerning Church and State: We believe in the separation of church and state. (Matthew 22:21) * Concerning Salvation: We believe that salvation is wholly by grace through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2: 8); and that all believers are preserved eternally. (I Peter 1. 5; John 10:27-30; Romans 8:35-39) * Concerning the Fall of Man: We believe that by transgression mankind fell, and that the fall brought about the inherent depravity of mankind, which made necessary salvation by grace through faith.

Nehemiah ben Hushiel is best known as a figure who appears in many medieval Jewish apocalyptic writings. In these writings he is cast as the Messiah ben Joseph who is an Ephraimite. Background In 590-591 CE according to Karaite sources the Exilarch Haninai was put to death by Khosrow II for supporting Bahram VI. The next Exilarch Haninais' son Bostanai would not reign until around 640 CE. Bostanai would be the first Exilarch under Arab rule. This would leave a fifty-year gap where no Exilarch would have reigned. It is thought that after Haninai was put to death, Khosrow II suspended all forms of Jewish self-governance and created many difficulties for rabbinical academies. By 609 CE, both of the major academies Sura and Pumbedita are known to have been holding classes and led by a Gaon. Account The historical records from this period are poor. Nehemiah ben Hushiel is thought to be an historical figure and leader of the Jewish revolt against Heraclius. Jacob Neusner guesses that Jews of the west supported Khosrow II against the Byzantines either not knowing or not caring about his persecution of the Exilarchs and suppression of Jews in the east. Frank Meir Loewenberg speculates that in order to gain Jewish support Khosrow II appointed an Exilarch of his choosing. Named Hushiel, this Exilarch had a son named Nehemiah - hence Nehemiah ben Hushiel. According to this guess Nehemiah was placed as the symbolic leader of the Jewish forces. The Persian Sassanians, commanded by Shahrbaraz, were joined by Nehemiah and the wealthy Jewish leader Benjamin of Tiberias, who had mustered a force of Tiberian Jews. The combined force captured Jerusalem in 614 CE without resistance. Nehemiah was then appointed the ruler of Jerusalem. He began the work of making arrangements for the building of the Third Temple, and sorting out genealogies to establish a new High Priesthood. After only a few months, a Christian revolt occurred. Nehemiah ben Hushiel and his \\"council of the righteous\\" were killed along with many other Jews, some throwing themselves off the city walls. The surviving Jews fled to Shahrbaraz’s encampment at Caesarea. The Christians were able to briefly retake the city for 19 days before the walls were breached by Shahrbaraz’s forces. In 617 CE, the Persians reversed their policy and sided with the Christians, probably because of pressure from Mesopotamian Christians. It has been suggested that Nehemiah ben Hushiel was killed then. However, it does not appear that Jews were violently expelled from Jerusalem as Sebeos thought. Instead, Modestos’ letter seems to imply that further Jewish settlers were banned from settling in or around Jerusalem. A small synagogue on the Temple Mount was also demolished. Sources =Sebeos' account= The Armenian bishop and historian Sebeos wrote an account of the fall of Jerusalem. He writes that at first the inhabitants of Jerusalem voluntarily submitted to the Jews and Persians, however after a few months, the ostikan appointed by Khosrau II to rule Jerusalem was killed in a Christian revolt. Sebeos writes that during the revolt many Jews were killed. Some throwing themselves off the city walls to escape. The remaining Jews fled to the Sasanian general Shahrbaraz. Shahrbaraz assembled his troops and went and encamped around Jerusalem and besieged it for 19 days. The Christian death toll was 17,000 in addition 35,000 people including the patriarch Zacharias were deported to Mesopotamia. For three days the Persian forces slaughtered and plundered the inhabitants of the city. The city was burned down. The Jews where then driven from the city and an archpriest named Modestos was appointed over the city. =Sefer Zerubbabel= The Sefer Zerubbabel is a medieval Hebrew apocalypse written in the style of biblical visions (e.g. Daniel, Ezekiel) placed into the mouth of Zerubbabel. It is thought to have been written at least partially during the beginning of the 7th century. In the Sefer Zerubbabel Aaron's rod, Elijah and Nehemiah ben Hushiel will be hidden in the city of Tiberias. After Nehemiah ben Hushiel takes possession of Jerusalem, he proceeds to sorts out Israel’s genealogical lists according to their families. He is killed in the fifth year which would be 619 during the month of Av (July - August). The Sefer Zerubbabel states that Shiroi King of Persia will stab Nehemiah ben Hushiel and Israel. His thoroughly crushed corpse will be thrown down before the gates of Jerusalem. And sixteen of the righteous shall be killed with him. Armilus enters Jerusalem on the 14th day of the new year during the month of Nisan. Presumably, this would coincide with March 28, 628. The Sefer Zerubbabel does not claim that Nehemiah ben Hushiel will be the Messiah ben David. Rather it asserts that he is the Messiah ben Joseph and a descendant of Joseph. The exilarchs traced their line back to David. Kavadh II made peace with Heraclius in 628 after the reign of Khosrow II. Armilus is thought to be a cryptogram for Heraclius. =Poems by Eleazar ben Killir= Three piyyutim attributed to Eleazar ben Kalir are thought to be based on an early version of the Sefer Zerubbabel. The first is believed to be dated between 629 and 634. In the text the Jews set up an altar and offer sacrifices, however they are not allowed to erect a sanctuary. The Jewish leader who is called the Messiah ben Joseph arises among them and within three months reaches the top. However, he is killed by the Persian chief commander in a small sanctuary shortly after. In a second piyyut, which is undatable, the Messiah ben Joseph is named as Nehemiah ben Hushiel. A third piyyut titled Oto ha-yom is dated later, as the Persians have been defeated by the Byzantines. However a king from Arabia then invades. This poem is thought to date from the early years of the Arab invasion. Nehemiah ben Hushiel is not mentioned. The Messiah ben David of the Sefer Zerubbabel Menahem ben Ammiel is now called the Messiah ben Joseph. Other texts mentioning Nehemiah =Otot ha-Mašiah (Signs of the Messiah)= Another medieval Hebrew apocalypse the Otot ha-Mašiah also casts Nehemiah ben Hushiel as a Messianic leader. It gives a less detailed account but is also thought to be dated to this period. The following texts also mention Nehemiah and they are all similar to ’Otot ha- Mašiah (Signs of the Messiah). For example, Nehemiah will confront Armilos with a Torah scroll in all of them and in some cases the text is almost identical. The texts are Tefillat (Prayer of) R. Shimon b. Yohai, ’Otot of R. Shimon b. Yohai and Ten Signs =Pirqe Mašiah= The medieval Hebrew apocalypse Pirqe Mašiah also mentions Nehemiah without his surname. It was clearly written later, as it mentions Arabs controlling the Temple Mount. The Arabs say this is our sanctuary it has nothing to do with you. The Arabs agree that both will present offerings and whoever's offering is accepted, the other will follow his ways. We will become one people ummah. Satan denounces the Jews before God. The Arabs' offering is accepted and the Jews' offering rejected. The Jews, however, refuse to commit apostasy. A battle erupts between the two and Nehemiah is slain, later to be resurrected Sebeos recorded a similar event in his history - in which Jewish men slaughtered pigs in the Muslim place of worship.

It was designed in 1928 by George W. Conable (1866-1933) and is a ten-story, \\"T\\" shaped building in the Colonial Revival style. History On May 23, 1919, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce (originally called the Jamaica Board of Trade) was conceived and established at a meeting 17 civic-minded businessmen and community leaders and incorporated. The purpose of this meeting was to promote the development Jamaica as a residential community and commercial center. By the mid 1920s, the Board expanded and moved Jamaica Avenue further out to the Stuart Building between 163rd and 164th Streets. During this time, the growth of greater Jamaica was significant and new residential developments were constructed; the development of these residential districts caused the business district to expand. In July 1927, the Board of Trade changed its organization's name to the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce in order to reflect the organization's \\"broader scope\\" of interests. A committee spent a year considering the construction and establishment of a building specifically for the Chamber of Commerce; the first idea for this new building was suggested by Secretary Max C. Bunyan. He suggested that in order to improve the work of the organization, \\"A building of its own, properly equipped, would be a big help towards making the Jamaica Board of Trade 100 percent efficient and ...that such a building could be erected, a part of it being set aside from offices and other business purposes, and that it could be operated at a profit to the organization.\\" In August 1928, George W. Conable submitted plans for a ten- story office building with a commercial ground floor, which included seven stories of rentable office space, as well as two stories reserved specifically for the offices, meeting and dining rooms of the Chamber of Commerce. The construction of this structure commenced in October 1928. On May 20, 1929, the building was dedicated; the Long Island Daily Press praised it as \\"a decided asset to the community, and a building that can hold its own in an architectural beauty contest.\\" Design and style George W. Conable designed this building with a distinctive facade based on 19th-century American and British precedents. It is a steel frame building faced in red brick and trimmed in stone and terra cotta detail.

Women active in the Auxiliaries were the wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of IUMMSW members. Women's organizations associated with trade unions in male-dominated industries have played a central role in labour struggles since the end of the 19th century.Sangster, J. (2000). Feminism and the Making of Canadian Working-Class History: Exploring the Past, Present and Future. Labour / Le Travail, 46 (Special Millennium Issue), 127-165. The Ladies Auxiliaries of the IUMMSW helped to sustain and build the strength of the union. During labour strikes, these women fed thousands of striking miners on the picket lines and organized clothing drives for strikers' needy families. They initiated letter-writing campaigns to improve worker safety, participating in labour organizing, and collectivized around various social issues such as child care, racism, and health care. These activities were unpaid. The work of these women contributed to the development of IUMMSW as a viable and powerful force in labour movement of the early 20th century. Others Ladies Auxiliary groups in the early 20th century included those associated with: the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters’, Carpenters, Milk Drivers, Mail Carriers, and Motion Picture Operators and the International Association of Machinists (this Auxiliary had a membership of over 20K in 1920).  International Union of Mine Mill and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW)  Along with other left-led unions, IUMMSW upheld the post-war vision of progress through labour unity and its active pursuit of broader social goals.Finkel, A. (2008). Trade unions and the welfare state in Canada: 1945-1990. In (eds.) B. Palmer & J. Sangster (eds) Labouring Canada: Class, gender, and race in Canadian Working-Class History. Don Mills: Oxford Press. pp. 356-367. It was successful in securing gains for its members at the bargaining table and animating its internal culture with their belief in the fairness and justice of an egalitarian society. Although an international union, IUMMSW had several very large Canadian locals in the 1950s in Ontario, British Columbia(BC), and Quebec. In the Sudbury local alone, IUMMSW organized close to 18,000 in the mines and smelters of International Nickel Company and Falconbridge. During the Cold War period, unions with left-leaning leaderships, such as IUMMMSW were isolated, raided, and ultimately defeated one by one, their leaders branded as subversives and enemy agents. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) infiltrated many of these unions and kept detailed surveillance files on their leading activists. Only in the early 1990s, 40 years after their covert surveillance, did the RCMP admit publicly to these activities, including their reliance on informants in the IUMMSW's Ladies Auxiliary.Steedman, M. (1993). The red petticoat brigade: Mine Mill Women’s Auxiliaires and the threat from within, 1940s-70s. In (eds). G. Kinsmen, D. Buse, & M. Steedman’s Whose National Security: Canadian State Surveillance and the Creation of Enemies The union's imperative was to contribute to the emancipation of the working-class, nominally men and women alike, although like many trade unions of the time, the membership of IUMMSW was exclusively male. Indeed, legislation in Ontario restricted women from all forms of mine employment other than clerical work well past mid- century.Forestell, N. (2003). The miner’s wife: Working-class femininity in a masculine context, 1920-1950. In (ed.) Gendered Pasts: Historical Essays in Femininity and Masculinity in Canada\\" edited by McPherson, Morgan & Forestall. Toronto : University of Toronto Press. pp. 139-157. The physical demands and inherent dangers of mine work were linked inextricably with masculinity. To be a miner, a millworker, or a smelterman was to be a man. Apart from their involvement as waged smelter workers during the war years, eclipsed in the aftermath of war when men returned to reclaim their positions, women contributed to the struggle for better working conditions in the mines and smelters via the Ladies’ Auxiliary. Inspired not by wages, but by their dreams of a fair and just world, these women prepared meals during strikes, organized clothing drives for picketers, and augmented the finances of the male locals with the proceeds of their bake sales, while working to address large-scale social and economic problems such as “Teenage Problems”, “Health”, “Racial Problems” and “World Peace” (see One LA Local's Program for Coming Year insert).  IUMMSW Ladies Auxiliary’s Political Work  2 mile long picket of women and children in the 1941 Kirkland Lake strike The image of the woman standing behind her man and his job became a sentimental theme in union literature. As Strom'sStrom, S. H. (1983). “Women’s Place: Feminism, the Left and industrial unionism in the 1930s. Feminist Studies, 9 (2). 359-386. archival research shows, the Congress Industrial Organization members thought \\"a good union girl’ should work to support her family, should use makeup moderately and keep her stocking seams straight, go out on the picket line with her man because having ‘girls come on the line…puts more pep in the gas’\\".p. 371 from CIO News 2 (Feb 20, 1939). One of LA Local's Program for the Following Year The historical records show, however, that LA did more than stand behind their male counterparts. While they took leading roles in strikes, such as the 1941 Kirkland Lake strike, they were not simply a ‘reserve army’ of the disappeared, resuming their posts in their kitchens after the strikes were over. Indeed, they had an active long-standing political agenda of their own including formal membership and involvements in women's organizations such as the Canadian Congress of Women. The political work of LA has largely gone un-noticed even by Auxiliaries of subsequent generations. For example, during the 1983 Copper Strike in Morenci, Arizona, the Morenci Miners Women's Auxiliary fed and clothed families, which served to build solidarity and commitment among the strikers and their families, but also actively maintained the picket line and organized rallies to raise public awareness and support. The women spoke of the latter set of activities as ‘new’ political work of the auxiliary: > We don’t just do what the auxiliary used to do....Aulette, J. & Mills, T. > (1988). Something old, something new: Auxiliary work in the 1983-1986 copper > strike. Feminist Studies, 14 (2). 251-268. In 1944, one of the largest IUMMSW Auxiliary locals was established in Sudbury with a membership of approximately 300 members. Local 117 charter of the LA was granted at the same time the largest local (598) of IUMMSW was certified as the bargaining agent for approximately 10,000 (or ¾) employees of International Nickel Company and Falconbridge. Auxiliary locals existed where there were men's MMSW locals. By 1946, there were 25 Canadian LA: Yellowknife, Northwest Territories; Trail, Kimerberly, Bralorne, Copper Mountain and Britannia in BC; Kississing, Flin Flon in Manitoba; Geraldton, Timmins, Kirkland Lake, Sudbury, New Toronto, and Port Colborne in Ontario; Rouyn- Noranda, Val D’or, and Malartic in Quebec.Unknown. (1946). Report of District 8, IUMMSW for the years 1945-46 To the President, Officers, 3-3 Committee and Vice-Presidents of the Auxiliaries of the IUMMSW. (17 - 2). IUMMSW (Canada), University of British Columbia Special Collections. Vancouver, BC. The geographic spread within some locals warranted branches (e.g. Creighton-Lively branch, Levack branch and Garson branch of 117). When the LA locals became sufficiently large, with many branches, as the Sudbury 117 did in the early 1960s, the branches became distinct LA locals, albeit they were still affiliated with the structure of the men's local, e.g. The mines at Creighton- Lively and Levack, originally branches of LA local 117, become #316 and #317, respectively.  IUMMSW Ladies Auxiliary’s Organizing Work  Many of the IUMMSW Auxiliaries were as long-lived as their male companion unions. Notably, the women took active roles in organizing not only the Auxiliaries but also the male locals. As one of the original Auxiliary members offers this compelling account of her organizing work: > You go ahead and you do it hey, but you are scared stiff. I was! I didn’t > think anybody would want to kill us because we were trying to organize > miners, it seemed incredible. The material sacrifice of the work tumble out not far behind: > Those few months I lived on carrots that we happened to grow in the garden. > And, if I ever see another soup bone it is going to be too many. From that > day to this, I don’t boil a soup bone.Dunphrey, B. (1982). Interview with > Ladies Auxiliary Member. [Audio File]. P 047, Laurentian University > Archives. Sudbury, ON.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, barracks buildings were constructed to accommodate up to four infantry battalions. The 2/10th, 2/43rd and 2/48th battalions of the Second Australian Imperial Force were formed at the camp. The base also provided training facilities for several CMF units and provided temporary accommodation for elements of the United States Army's 32nd Infantry Division when it first arrived in Australia in May 1942. The camp was converted into a refugee reception camp in 1949 and could house up to 3,000 people. After being vacated the camp was again pressed into military service. It was the home of 3rd Bn Royal Australian Regiment from 14 Oct 1965 in the Kapyong Lines during its period of service in South Viet Nam and after before the move to Holsworthy in 1982.

Jaisalmer Fort. Jaisalmer State was a Bhati Rajput kingdom in the far-western part of present- day Rajasthan, India, from the mid-12th century CE until 1947. In 1156 CE, Rawal Jaisal moved his capital from Ludarva to Jaisalmer because the former was vulnerable to attacks from Turko-Afghan and Baloch tribes. The descendants of Jaisal continued to exercise absolute control over Jaisalmer until 1818 CE, when a treaty of subsidiary alliance with the British Empire made it a princely state, a British Protectorate still running its own internal affairs. Known as the Maharawal, the native ruler of the princely state was entitled to a 15-gun salute. Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 24, p. 386. Early History The royal dynasty of Jaisalmer claims to be descended from the deified hero Krishna. The Bhatti rulers originally ruled parts of Afghanistan; their ancestor Rawal Gaj is believed to have founded the city of Gajni. According to James Tod, this city is present-day Ghazni in Afghanistan, while Cunningham identifies it as modern-day Rawalpindi. Rawal Gaj was killed in battle while fighting the Persian king of Khorasan, and his descendants were forced to migrate to Punjab. His descendant Rawal Salivahan is believed to have founded the city of Sialkot and made it his new capital. Salivahan defeated the Saka Scythians in 78 CE at Kahror, assuming the title of Saka-ari (foe of the Sakas). Salivahan's grandson Rawal Bhati (Bhatti) conquered several neighbouring regions. It is from him that the Bhati (Bhatti) clan derives its name.https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V14_008.gif History of Jaisalmer The Bhatti kingdom, marked as Multhan in 800 CE The state of Jaisalmer had its foundations in what remains of the Empire ruled by the Bhati dynasty. Early Bhati rulers ruled over large empire stretching from Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan to Sialkot, Lahore and Rawalpindi in modern- day Pakistan to Bhatinda and Hanumangarh in Modern day India. The empire crumbled over time because of continuous invasions from the central Asia. According to Satish Chandra, the Hindu Shahis of Afghanistan made an alliance with the Bhatti rulers of Multhan, because they wanted to end the slave raids made by the Turkic ruler of Ghazni, however the alliance was defeated by Alp Tigin in 977 CE.Medieval India 1206-1526 part one, pg.17 by Satish Chandra Bhati dominions continued to be shifted towards the South as they ruled Multan, then finally got pushed into Cholistan and Jaisalmer where Rawal Devaraja built Dera Rawal / Derawar. Jaisalmer was the new capital founded in 1156 by Maharawal Jaisal Singh and the state took its name from the capital. On 11 December 1818 Jaisalmer became a British protectorate in the Rajputana Agency.Princely States of India Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, the main source of income for the kingdom was levies on caravans, but the economy was heavily affected when Bombay emerged as a major port and sea trade replaced the traditional land routes. Maharawals Ranjit Singh and Bairi Sal Singh attempted to turn around the economic decline but the dramatic reduction in trade impoverished the kingdom. A severe drought and the resulting famine from 1895 to 1900, during the reign of Maharawal Salivahan Singh, only made matters worse by causing widespread loss of the livestock that the increasingly agriculturally based kingdom relied upon. The attempts of Maharawal Jawahir Singh (1914–1949) at modernization were also not entirely successful in turning the kingdom’s economy around, and the drylands of Jaisalmer remained backward compared with other regions of Rajputana, especially the neighbouring state of Jodhpur. Nonetheless, the extensive water storage and supply, sanitation, and health infrastructures developed in the 1930s by the prime minister Dewan Bahadur Brijmohan Nath Zutshi provided significant relief during the severe droughts of 1941 and 1951. Maharawal During 1930-1947, Jawahir Singh and his ministers also promoted technical education and the academic disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering in the state. After the departure of the British from India in 1947, the Maharawal signed an Instrument of Accession to the new Union of India, while retaining some internal autonomy until the 1950s.

It is under the authority of the Diocese of Bridgeport, and was founded under the patronage of St. Rose of Lima, the first person born in the Americas to be canonized by the Catholic Church.  History The first Catholics to reside in Newtown arrived involuntarily. They were four Acadians billeted on the town in 1756 by the General Assembly. No further information is known regarding them. From late June to early July 1781, Count Rochambeau encamped at Newtown and it is presumed the French chaplains celebrated Mass for the troops. In 1858, Rev. John Smith purchased a Universalist meeting-house to conduct services for a congregation of about 100.O'Donnell, James H., History of the Diocese of Hartford, D. H. Hurd Company, 1900, p. 274 The parish was founded in 1859, the first in that region of the county, originally serving 11 towns in the northern part. The first resident pastor was Rev. Francis Lenihan. Before his appointment, Newtown was served by priests from Danbury. During the tenure of pastor James McCarten, a church was erected in 1882. Rev. P. Fox established the parish school in 1896; it was staffed by the sisters of Mercy. The modern Colonial Revival-style church dates from the early 1960s. School St. Rose of Lima Catholic School, located at 40 Church Hill Road, provides education to children in preschool through eighth grade. In 2009, the school won the Blue Ribbon Award. Relation to Sandy Hook shooting On December 14, 2012, a 20-year-old man, Adam Lanza, killed 26 people at a local elementary school in a tragedy which gained international attention. The dead included twenty children and six members of the school staff. Additionally, the shooter's own mother was found shot to death in her home elsewhere in the town. Initial reports indicated that Lanza might have attended middle school there. That evening, a candle-light vigil was held at St. Rose Church, at which various religious leaders of the town and the Governor of Connecticut, Dan Malloy, addressed the assembled crowd. The parish offered a special Mass that same evening and the church remained open throughout the night, in order to provide a place of comfort for the people of the town. On Sunday, December 16, around noon, someone called the parish office and said, “I’m going to kill everyone there. My friend didn’t finish the job”. Parish officials tried to keep the caller on the line, asking him to repeat himself. He did so, making the same threat in the same words. Churchgoers quickly evacuated church. Police in SWAT gear arrived at the church to check out the area. Funerals for 11 of the children killed in the shooting were held at St. Rose Church.

Antwerp is short and fragmentary, composed of 56 pieces (which could be seen as vignettes or sketches) with a loose narrative structure. Though there are some recurring characters and story lines, there is no central narrative. Many of the subjects dealt with become Bolaño's common material for his other works of fiction - crimes and campgrounds, drifters and poetry, sex and love, corrupt cops and misfits. Bolaño had once stated that \\"The only novel that doesn't embarrass me is Antwerp.\\".quoted on back cover of Antwerp. New York: New Directions Publishing, 2010. In the introduction he wrote for the book in 2002 Bolaño claimed: > \\"I wrote this book for myself, and even that I can't be sure of. For a long > time these were just loose pages that I reread and maybe tinkered with, > convinced I had no time. But time for what? I couldn't say exactly. I wrote > this book for the ghosts, who, because they're outside of time, are the only > ones with time.\\"Bolaño, Roberto. \\"Total Anarchy: Twenty-Two Years Later\\", > Introduction to Antwerp.

Forty-one of the Africans drowned in the wreck. Guerrero had been engaged in a battle with a British anti- slavery patrol ship, HMS Nimble, stationed on the northern approaches to Cuba. Nimble also ran onto the reef, but was refloated and returned to service. The two ships were attended by wreckers, who rescued the Spanish crew and surviving Africans from their ship and helped refloat Nimble. Spanish crew members hijacked two of the wrecking vessels and took almost 400 Africans to Cuba, where they were sold as slaves. Most of the remaining Africans were eventually returned to Africa.Shearer:8-9 Swanson:14-16 History The history of the ship is unclear. Because the slave trade to Cuba was illegal in the 1820s, ships that successfully delivered a cargo of slaves from Africa to Cuba were often destroyed or registered under a new name to avoid confiscation by the Spanish authorities. The British Consul in Santiago, Cape Verde reported in 1827 that the ship then known as Guerrero was the former James Monroe, which was launched in 1813 in New London, Connecticut, and had served as a privateer during the War of 1812. James Monroe made two trading voyages to France during the war, capturing a total of six British ships on those voyages. It made at least two more crossings to France after the end the war. Its later history is unclear, in part because a number of American ships were named for James Monroe after he became President of the United States in 1817.Malcom:6-9 Swanson:25 The ship known in 1827 as Guerrero was heavily armed. She carried four long brass 12-pounder guns and ten iron 12-pounders, and carried a crew of 90 or more men. Such large, well-armed slave ships often engaged in piracy, robbing smaller ships of their cargoes, including slaves. Prior to 1826 the ship was known as San Jose. In June 1826 a brig then known as Pepe, likely the ship later known as Guerrero, sailed from Havana for Africa. A few days later a \\"Spanish\\" brig stopped and robbed a sloop on its way from Bermuda to Norfolk, Virginia. Late in July what probably was the same brig robbed two American ships anchored at Cape Mesurado in Liberia. Two British warships were dispatched to catch the pirate ship, now identified as Pepe. The British ships caught up to Pepe, but it managed to escape during a heavy rainstorm. Pepe loaded about 600 Africans at Gallinas (near the border between present day Sierra Leone and Liberia) and delivered about 570 of them to Cuba late in the year.Malcom:2-4, 6-9 Swanson:7-8 Last voyage On 14 July 1827 Guerrero sailed from Havana for Africa. Her departure was noted (along with that of several other suspected slave ships) by British commissioners in Havana. About 700 Africans, some of whom may have been forcibly taken from other slave ships, were on Guerrero when it sailed from Africa for Cuba. On 19 December 1827 Guerrero was sailing south towards Cuba in the Florida Straits carrying 561 Africans who had survived the voyage when it was spotted by HMS Nimble near Orange Cay (on the Great Bahama Bank). Nimble was smaller and more lightly armed (crew of 56, with, by various reports, eight, five or just three guns)Swanson:13 states that one source says \\"8 guns\\", while another says \\"two gunades and an 18-pounder on a swivel\\"; O'Byrne:96 states \\"5 guns\\". than Guerrero. Nimble fired two shots to order the suspected slave ship to stop for inspection, but Guerrero ran, starting a five-hour chase during which the weather turned bad and night came on. As Nimble closed the distance between the ships they commenced firing at each other. The crew on the lightship Caesar, stationed on Carysfort Reef near Key Largo, could see and hear the battle, which appeared to be about ten miles away.Shearer:7-8 Swanson:1-2, 9, 12-14 After a half-hour of battle Guerrero appeared to signal that it was surrendering, but then tried to run off. Nimble resumed the pursuit, even though the ships were entering shallower water. At about 7:30 PM Guerrero hit a reef while sailing at close to ten knots. The impact tore the hull open and toppled the masts. Forty-one of the Africans confined in the hold were drowned as Guerrero sank. Nimble tried to turn away, but five minutes later it also ran onto a reef. Although its crew managed to get Nimble off the reef, it drifted back onto the reef, and a receding tide left it there, about two-and-one-half miles (four km) from the wreck of Guerrero.Shearer:8-9 Swanson:14-16 Rescue The next morning, 20 December 1827, wreckers on the schooner Thorn and sloop Surprize, who had anchored overnight in Caesar's Creek,Also called Black Caesar's Creek, it connects the Atlantic Ocean to Biscayne Bay between Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key saw the two ships on the reef and went to their aid. They were soon joined by the fishing smack Florida and later by other wreckers. When the wreckers reached Guerrero, her captain, Joze Gomez, requested that the American flag be raised on the wrecked ship, indicating that it was an American prize, and not taken by the British Nimble. On the other hand, Lt. Edward Holland, commander of Nimble, insisted that Guerrero had surrendered before the ships hit the reef, and was therefore a British prize.Shearer:9 Swanson:17-22 Nimble had lost its rudder, and had to be lightened and towed off the reef. The swivel gun was transferred to one of the wreckers and cannonballs and ballast thrown overboard. The crewmen and surviving Africans on Guerrero were loaded onto several of the wreckers. Florida took 20 of the Spanish crewmen and 142 Africans aboard and immediately departed for Key West. Before reaching there, however, the Spanish crewmen from Guerrero hijacked Florida and sailed it and the 142 Africans to Cuba. Thorn took 54 of the Spanish crewmen and 246 Africans, including all of the women. Thorn had not left by late afternoon, and Lt. Bolton requested that it anchor close to Nimble overnight so that the warship could help protect the wrecker from the Spanish crewmen on it. Even so, the Spanish crewmen hijacked Thorn from under the guns of Nimble and took it and the 246 Africans aboard to Cuba.Shearer:9-10 Swanson:19-24 Surprize, which had taken on 12 of the Spanish crewmen and 122 Africans, anchored for the night near the wreck of Guerrero in the company of two other wreckers, the sloop Capital and schooner General Geddes. John Morrison, captain of General Geddes, later testified that he was fearful of the intentions of the Spanish crewmen, and had ordered his own crew to arm themselves so that they could protect both Surprize and his ship from any attempt by the Spanish to seize them. The next morning Surprize approached Nimble and transferred ten of the Spanish crewmen to it (Nimble already had another ten Spanish crewmen aboard), leaving only two on Surprize, and then sailed for Key West. Capital and General Geddes helped salvage the rudder from Guerrero and mount it on Nimble. The three ships then sailed for Key West.Shearer:10 Swanson:21, 29-32 Disputes Nimble, Capital and General Geddes reached Key West on 24 December and Florida and Thorn returned from Cuba the next day, their crews having been released unharmed. One of the Africans on Surprize died before reaching Key West, so 121 were unloaded there. Lt. Holden claimed that the Africans were under his protection because Guerrero had surrendered to him. The Collector of Customs for the port claimed custody of the Africans because they had been landed in American territory after being shipwrecked. The wreckers claimed salvage on Nimble for helping to get it off the reef and replace the rudder. Lt. Holden refused to submit to the arbitration procedure established by Florida territorial law, which would have let a panel of local residents, almost all of whom had a financial stake in wrecking, decide how much in salvage fees were due the wreckers. Nimble left Key West without the Africans, and the wreckers remained unpaid. Nimble delivered the 20 Cuban crewmen it was holding to Havana to be dealt with by the British-Spanish Mixed Commission Court that dealt with Spanish slave-runners caught near Cuba.Shearer:10 Swanson:3, 33-35, 46 Transfer to St. Augustine The 121 Africans presented a problem to Key West, which had only some 420 residents. In response to a rumor that a ship was being prepared in Cuba to attack Key West and take the Africans, Key West prepared to defend itself. There were also attempts by Americans to take by force or by bribery part or all of the Africans. After seven weeks, in March 1828, the Africans were transferred to St. Augustine, and delivered into the custody of the U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Florida, Waters Smith. Only 114 reached St. Augustine. Six had died in Key West, and one was kept by the captain of the revenue cutter that escorted the ship carrying the Africans to St. Augustine.Swanson:41-45 One of the Africans, named Lewis, was not a captive, but had been hired as an interpreter by the captain of Guerrero. Lewis had been to Havana on at least one earlier slave ship. He had also brought his son with him, and asked that he and his son be released to go to Havana so that he could collect his wages. Lewis was eventually released, but his son was not.Swanson:59-60, 68-69 Uncertain status Although he expected to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith had to pay for the care of the Africans from his own pocket. (In the end, Smith was reimbursed for only part of what he had spent, and he had to mortgage his home to cover the rest.) To partially cover his expenses, he hired the Africans out to plantation owners at two dollars per month each. Boys too young for field work were placed as servants in private homes. Several of the men were blind or sick, and could not be put to work. At this point the condition of the Africans rescued from Guerrero was indistinguishable from slavery. The Africans were in a legal limbo. There were laws covering Africans seized while being illegally imported into the United States, but they did not apply to Africans who entered the country accidentally. In April 1828 President John Quincy Adams requested Congress to pass a supplementary law dealing with the Guerrero Africans, but it failed to act. A year later, in March 1829, Congress appropriated funds to reimburse Waters Smith and transport the Guerrero Africans to Liberia.Swanson:60, 66-72, 81-82 Return to Africa A ship to transport the Africans to Liberia was engaged in June, 1829, and Waters Smith was ordered to prepare the Africans for embarkation. There were delays when the ship had to be replaced, and the departure point for the Africans was moved from St. Augustine to Fernandina, Florida. Smith had problems gathering the Africans. He had rented 36 of the Africans to Zephaniah Kingsley and another 20 to Joseph Marion Hernández. When Smith called for the hired-out Africans to be returned to him so that they could be shipped to Africa, Kingsley and Hernandez refused to do so, based on an opinion by the Collector of Customs for St. Augustine that the Africans were free men and therefore Smith had no authority to hire them out as slaves or to remove them from the possession of Kingsley and Hernandez and order them sent to Africa. Smith was able to bring the Africans into Fernandina, \\"[p]artly by force and partly by persuasion\\".Swanson:78 Hernández never paid any of the money he owed Smith for the 20 Africans he had rented. Smith also paid Seminoles to bring in some of the Africans that had run away from Kingsley's and Hernández' plantations. Smith felt that he had to stay on guard in Fernandina because he suspected that slave dealers were planning to steal some of the Africans to carry them away for sale as slaves.Swanson:60-62, 73-74, 77-80 After further delays, 100 of the Africans were boarded on Washington's Barge, which sailed on 30 September 1829. (Some of the Africans had died, and some were too ill to travel. Two boys were kept back because they had yaws.) On 31 December 1829 Washington's Barge arrived in Barbados, badly damaged and out of drinking water. Five of the Guerrero Africans had died since leaving Fernandina. The Africans were transferred to the brig Heroine, which sailed on 16 January 1830 and arrived in Liberia 4 March 1830. They were settled in New Georgia, a town a few miles from Monrovia, where they joined people who had been recaptured from the slave ship Antelope by the U.S. Revenue Cutter Dallas in 1820 and sent to Liberia in 1827.Swanson:81, 94-100, 106-09 Search for wreck site Archaeologists have searched for the sites of the sunken Guerrero and grounding of Nimble. One area of interest was the entrance to Turtle Harbor, four miles east of the northern end of Key Largo and three and a half miles north of the Carysfort Reef Light. Artifacts found in a search of the area from 2003 to 2006 did not specifically identify any ship. Swanson maintained that the wreck sites were likely further north, near Pacific Reef. One problem was that various accounts placed the wreck sites at six to ten miles from the Carysfort Reef lightship, but the position of that lightship is not well established (contemporary sources vary wildly, even putting the lightship inland). A documentary about the search for the Guerrero wreck site narrated by James Avery, The Guerrero Project, was produced in 2004.Swanson:141-48The Guerrero Project (2004) at IMDb In August 2015 the Diving with a Purpose Underwater Archaeology Program in conjunction with the National Park Service and the National Association of Black Scuba Divers announced they believe the wreck has been located on the reef off the coast of Key Largo, Fl. Underwater excavations in 2010 and 2012 by the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified the wreck through a cologne bottle from the early 1800s, bone china, lead shot, blue- edged earthenware, metal rigging, copper fasteners, and wooden plank fragments recovered from the wreck site.

The state was in area and its annual income was Rs.3,000,000 in the 1940s. History The princely state of Jind & Sangrur was founded in 1763.According to the World Statesmen website It was part of Cis-Sutlej state grouping of princely states, which was ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire, various small Punjabi kingdoms of the Cis-Sutlej states paid tributes to the Marathas, until the Second Anglo- Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the colonial British raj. On 25 April 1809 Jind became a British protectorate. Gajpat Singh ruled under the title of raja until 1789, then Bhag Singh until 1819, Fateh Singh until 1822, and Sangat Singh until 1834. After a vacancy of three years, Sarup Singh ruled until 1864, succeeded by Raghubir Singh, who took the title Raja-i Rajgan in 1881. In 1887 he was succeeded by Ranbir Singh, who became Maharaja in 1911 and continued to rule the state until its accession to India in 1947. Ranbir Singh, last Ruler of Jind, was called Colonel His Highness Farzand-i-dilband Rasikh-ul-itikad Daulat-i-englishia Raja-i-rajgan Maharaja Sir Ranbir Singh Rajendra Bahadur. After the independence of India in 1947, the princely states were first integrated with India and later those were merged in various states of India in 1949 whereby they lost all ruling rights and the rulers were given a Privy Purse (type of pension) as part of their agreements tfirst integrate with India. The Privy Purse was abolished in by the 26th Amendment in 1971, by which all their privileges and allowances from the Central Government ceased to exist, was implemented in 1973 after a two-year legal battle. Though according to the hereditary convention of succession the eldest son of the successive generations continued to claim the title of Maharaja. After Ranbir Singh's death his eldest son Rajbir Singh (b.1918 - d.1959) claimed the [officially abolished] title, which then passed to Rajbir's eldest son Satbir Singh (b.1940 - still living).Satbir Singh is the rightful claimant of Jind state, Dainik bhaskar, 4 Feb 2019. On 20 August 1948, with the signing of accession to India, Jind became a part of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union and ceased to exist as a separate state.

Both Bharatichand and Madhukar had to deal with attacks, organised under the Afghan Islam Shah Suri (r. 1545-53) and the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605). Events involving the former were noted by the court poet Keshavdas and those involving Madhukar, who had to relinquish lands to Akbar in 1577 and 1588, were recorded in the Akbarnama. Madhukar's position had become so precarious in the 1570s that he agreed to Orchha becoming a tributary state and to enlistment of himself and his family in the service of the Mughal empire, but another near-contemporary historian, \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni, records him as a rebel in 1583. The capture of Orchha by invading Mughal forces (October 1635). During the rule of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, his vassal, Vir Singh Deo, was ruler of the Orchha area. His reign ended in either 1626 or 1627 and it was during this period that Orchha reached its zenith in both political power and architectural splendour. Esxamples of the architecture include the Jahangir Mahal (built ca. 1605) and the Sawan Bhadon Mahal. In the early-17th century, Raja Jhujhar Singh rebelled against the Mughal emperor but was defeated. Shah Jahan placed the former raja's brother on the throne in 1641. Orchha was the only Bundela state not entirely subjugated by the Marathas in the 18th century. The town of Tehri, Tikamgarh, about south of Orchha, became the capital of Orchha state in 1783, and is now the district town; Tehri was the site of the fort of Tikamgarh, and the town eventually took the name of the fort.

The first Orchha State stamps were issued in 1913 (half-anna and one anna); in 1914 there was another issue of four stamps (half-anna to four annas). The third issue was in 1939 when a range of stamps bearing the maharajah's portrait were issued which included denominations from half-anna to eight annas and one rupee to ten rupees. Separate stamps were discontinued on 30 April 1950 after the state was merged with the Union of India early that year.  Coinage  Orchha minted coins in copper and silver. The currency was known as Gaja Shahi because it most commonly bore the symbol of a mace (gaja) on the reverse. The mace symbol was imitated on coins issued by Datia State.

The boat was built as a civilian motor launch in 1914 by the Chance Marine Construction Company at Annapolis, Maryland. The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy with all expenses, wages, supplies and repairs paid by the federal government. On 17 August 1917 Music became a section patrol boat under the agreement and was commissioned as USS Music (SP-1288) assigned to the 5th Naval District. Music served on patrol and inspection duties in Hampton Roads and on the Elizabeth River in Virginia during World War I. Music returned to exclusive use by the Conservation Commission on 24 September 1918. On return to the state force the boat was assigned to patrol out of Port Republic, Maryland along with the power boat Dorothy. In 1920 older boats were sold with Music being sold for $625.

As the first Catholic Church in Norwalk from which three other parishes developed, St. Mary's is considered the Mother Church of Norwalk.  History The first Mass celebrated in Norwalk was said in 1833 by Rev. James McDermot of New Haven, in the front room of Michael Cooney's house, near the dock on the east side of Water Street. McDermot would visit Norwalk semi-annually until 1837, when he was transferred to Lowell. The congregation at that time numbered about twenty-five persons. McDermot was followed by Rev. James Smyth, also of New Haven, who continue to say Mass at Clooney's, as well as, in the basement of George F. Belden's tin store. O'Donnell, James H., History of the Diocese of Hartford, D. H. Hurd Company, 1900, p. 276 In 1844, Norwalk became a mission of Bridgeport. Rev. Michael Lynch said Mass at the home of Brian Mahoney at the foot of Mill Hill on Wall street. By the summer, he was using a large tenement house on River Street as it could better accommodate the seventy-five people in attendance. In 1848, the Catholic community in Norwalk petitioned Bishop William Tyler of the Diocese of Hartford for a resident priest. Tyler visited Norwalk and said Mass at Marine Hall.\\"St. Mary's Parish\\", The Sacred Heart Review, Volume 15, Number 23, 6 June 1896 The bishop was sufficiently impressed that he appointed Rev. John Brady to Norwalk with Stamford and some neighboring places as missions. Construction of the New York and New Haven Railroad drew a good number of Catholic laborers, and Brady secured permission to use the Town Hall for religious services. As Brady was also responsible for Danbury, Newtown, and Stamford, he made it to Norwalk about once a month. Brady set about to establish a proper church. Among the first to subscribe to contributions were the influential Rev. Dr. Mead of St. Paul's Episcopal church and the Congregationalist minister, Dr. Hall. He purchased property on Chapel Street, opposite Academy Street, and its first church, a modest wooden frame structure 36 by 40 feet, was dedicated in 1851 by Bishop Bernard O'Reilly. Brady resided on the \\"Cove Road\\" near Stamford and said Mass at Norwalk semi-monthly. In 1852, a Rev. Kelly was assigned to Norwalk as assistant and Mass was then celebrated every Sunday. Brady was transferred to Provience because of ill health and was succeeded in 1853 by Rev. E.C. Cooney, a great temperance man. Rev. Hugh O'Reilly became pastor the following year and purchased a residence on Chapel Street known as the \\"Eldridge Brown House\\". O'Reilly's tenure saw the rise of the Know Nothings, who expressed their hostility by setting fire to the church, and on another occasion sawing off the gilded cross atop the church. Rev. Peter Smith (1862-1875) set about to build the current church. He broke ground for it in 1867, and the basement chapel was dedicated about a year later. Here the growing Irish community could have Mass while they raised money to build the church up above. Upon completion of the basement, the old church was sold and the bodies in the old graveyard reinterred in the new cemetery. It was not until 1870 that the upper church was dedicated. Worn out by his labors, Smith died in 1875 and is buried in historical St. Mary Cemetery of Norwalk. In 1890 the marble and decoration of the church was completed by Pastor Fr. Slocum. The parish of St. Mary was split several times to form new parishes, as Norwalk's Catholic population grew. The parish of Saint Joseph was formed in 1895. The parish of St. Matthew was split off in 1958, the parish of St. Jerome was split off in 1960, and the parish of St. Philip was created in 1964.Janet Blake, St. Philip Roman Catholic Church website, accessed January 23, 2011 Architecture The Gothic Revival-style church was built in the early 1870s to the design of the noted church architect James Murphy.http://www.cardcow.com/65083/st-marys-c-church-norwalk- connecticut/ early post card featuringt St. Mary Church, Norwalk, CT The church's facade ornamentation is alternate blocks of light and dark cut granite. The tower, narrowing in tiers by means of buttress work, and the varied pedimenting that leads up to the most spire, combining to produce a harmonious front effect. The rose-window consists of an octofoil opening surrounded by eight smaller lights; while above this symmetrical arrangement are three lancets. The church interior was Gothic, with pillars, finished in a combination of fluting and scalloping, capped in flower and leaf work. Renovation work was done in 1931 and a side door added on the south side. In 1961 the altar rail was removed and the marble was covered over with carpet. All three marble altars were reduced in size, and browns and beige covered the details of earlier painting.Tribe, Shawn. \\"Before and After: St. Mary's Church, Norwalk, Connecticut\\", Liturgical Arts Journal, October 5, 2018 The church was subsequently extensively remodeled under the direction of Duncan Stroik, professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame.

This mother's vaccination therefore reduces the risk of infection for the child on her lap. Cocooning, also known as the Cocoon Strategy, is a vaccination strategy to protect infants and other vulnerable individuals from infectious diseases by vaccinating those in close contact with them. If the people most likely to transmit an infection are immune, their immunity creates a \\"cocoon\\" of protection around the newborn (or other vulnerable person). Cocooning is especially commonly used for pertussis. It aims to protect newborn infants from becoming infected with pertussis by administering DTaP/Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis) booster vaccine to parents, family members and any individuals who would come into regular contact with the newborn infant. By vaccinating these individuals with a pertussis booster, a pool of persons is established around the newborn who are themselves protected from getting pertussis and passing it on to the infant, thereby creating a \\"cocoon\\" of protection around the newborn. Young infants have the highest rate of pertussis; in 87-100% of all deaths caused by pertussis, the victim is an infant of less than 6 months of age, too young to have finished acquiring vaccine-induced immunity. Adolescents and young adults whose immunity has just worn off are often infected, but very unlikely to die. They can, however, infect others. 35% to 68% of infants infected with pertussis are infected by a close contact, most commonly the mother. Cocooning prevents about 20% of infant pertussis cases; vaccination during pregnancy prevents more (33%). Rationale immunity to viruses Some people cannot be fully protected from vaccine-preventable diseases by direct vaccination. These are often people with weak immune systems, who are more likely to get seriously ill. Their risk of infection can be significantly reduced if those who are most likely to infect them get the appropriate vaccines. Vaccination works by training the immune system to react promptly to an infection, warding off illness (acquired immunity). People with weak immune systems may have difficulty acquiring and retaining immunity. A baby's immune system is not yet fully developed. Babies are more likely to have serious complications or die from diseases, even diseases that have milder effects in adults. A baby can use some antibodies from the mother, transmitted in the womb. For this reason, it is recommended that people who are expecting to become pregnant get some vaccines, and those who are pregnant get others. However, this maternal protection wears off after a few months. Breastfeeding also offers protection, but is not as effective as vaccination at preventing some diseases. Some people have compromised immune systems. The immune system can be compromised by congenital medical conditions, infectious diseases, non-infectious conditions such as cancer, and immunosuppressive medications or treatments (for instance, people with organ transplants take drugs to prevent their immune system from killing the transplant). People who are severely immuno- compromised may not be able to take some vaccines; on the other hand, they may be much more severely affected by an infection. If the people they share a house with are immune, this provides them with significant protection. They benefit when their housemates get all the recommended inactivated vaccines. They also benefit if their housemates get many attenuated vaccines. However, some attenuated vaccines are not recommended for people living with immuno- compromised people, depending on the vaccine and cause of immune suppression. Some vaccines require multiple doses, spaced over time, to be effective. Those who have not yet received all the doses (including all young babies) are not yet fully immune, and rely on the immunity of those around them. Some vaccines also require booster doses in later life; those who have not received their booster doses can be infected and infect others. Some people are also unable to take some vaccines due to an allergic reaction. Recommendations and use Cocooning is widely recommended. Cocooning for pertussis has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States since 2006. The World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Global Pertussis Initiative, and the Public Health Agency of Canada all recommend cocooning against pertussis. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended cocooning with Tdap vaccine since 2005 and has continued to recommend this strategy for all those with expected close contact with infants. ACIP states that cocooning provides maximum protection to the infant beyond what is provided by maternal vaccination. ACIP is recommending that all relatives and caregivers get vaccinated against pertussis at least two weeks before coming into contact with infants. While acceptance of cocooning is high, implementation in not yet widespread as of 2012.

It fosters a commitment to service as well as prepares young men and women for leadership roles of mid-level management or higher in the fields of education, government, domestic and international community affairs, social justice, and philanthropy. Singer Mary J. Blige was a retreat guest in 1990. History Achieving Leadership’s Purpose, Inc., (\\"ALP\\") was founded in 1968 as the Archbishop’s Leadership Project by Terence Cardinal Cooke with the mission of cultivating African-American leadership in the Catholic Church, and serving the broader community. Over the years, the program has come to include students of various religious backgrounds and African Diasporan origins (African, African-American, Afro-Latino, Caribbean, and Caribbean-American). In 1968, Father John Meehan was chosen to direct the first group, and was tasked with designing a program that would encourage young Black men to pursue vocations in the priesthood. However, by the middle of their first weekend retreat, he discovered that the young men were less interested in joining the priesthood, and more interested in exploring their history and the issues facing their community. Keeping the needs of the youth in mind, by the end of the first two years the original objective of attracting Black youth to the priesthood was subsumed into an approach to motivate, inspire, and encourage young boys to consider roles of leadership within the African-American community. In the summer of 1985, Fr. Meehan and alumnus Peter Sanders'74 met with Cardinal O'Connor to provide an introductory report on the program started by his predecessor, Cardinal Cooke. Impressed with the program, Cardinal O'Connor decided to keep ALP in the Archbishop’s discretionary budget and felt that the work of ALP could be extended to young women. When a new ALP group was formed in the spring of 1986, it included over twenty Black high school girls and a female co-coordinator, Ms. Taur Orange, making ALP a coeducational program. In March 2005, ALP incorporated as an independent not- for-profit organization, changing its name to Achieving Leadership’s Purpose, Inc. The development and training process emphasizes critical thinking, presentation skills, leadership dynamics, an appreciation for history and culture, and service to others.

She became an important figure in history when her diary was discovered during the excavation of Jamestown. Early life Elanor was born in Whitby, England out of wedlock to John Allerton and Margaret Smith in 1639. John Allerton fled Holland in 1635 due to an outbreak of the Bubonic Plague. When he reached England, he entered into a brief affair with Margaret Smith and began to restart his shipbuilding business. With the news of Margaret's pregnancy, her mother, who came from a well-to-do family of nobles, paid her father off to keep Elanor away from the public eye until her 10th birthday. Her father contracted Syphilis from a local prostitute and began working on his final ship, which was a vessel meant for colonization of the New World. Journey to Jamestown (1649-1652) As John Allerton's mental conditions deteriorated, he became increasingly paranoid, which was reflected in the design and construction of his final ship. While negotiating payment with the ship's buyers, Allerton asked only that his daughter be a passenger on the ship and that the half the money he would have received be given to his daughter upon her arrival in the new world. With the influence of the Smiths' old money and their desire to keep Elanor a secret from the town, the ship buyers agreed to terms. As news of Algerian pirates incepting British vessels began to circulate, John Allerton built a Scooby-Doo-like passageway into the front hull of the ship, telling only his daughter of the alteration. When it was time for Elanor to set sail, her father was in the last few days of his life. The ship left port in London on April 3, 1650; John Allerton died within the week. =Altercation with Algerian Pirates= Not a full day before embarking out of the English harbor, the ship was overtaken by Barbary pirates and Elanor found herself in the nook her father created just for her. The pirates killed 5 colonists in the struggle and were on their way back to North America when a British Naval ship intercepted the pirates. Elanor was found and brought back to England, where she embarked once again on the journey to the New World. Arrival in the New World On the second ship, Elanor was under the charge of Katherine St. Leger Culpeper, a friend of Margaret Smith's family. The Culpepers had a young daughter the same age as Elanor named Francis and they became fast friends. When the ship arrived in Jamestown Virginia, the two girls had great difficulty parting ways and wrote many letters to one another over the years. Life in Jamestown Immediately after arriving in the New World, the Culpepers had Francis married to Captain Samuel Stephens, a prominent landowner and governor in the Albemarle Settlements. The Culpepers took care of Elanor, receiving a good amount of her grant, until she was 15 and old enough to be married off. Elanor married the tavern keeper, Adam Sutton, a twenty-eight-year-old who earned his post at the tavern by working for six years as an indentured servant. It was in her early years of Jamestown that Elanor began her work of journaling her life. She was particularly interested in the small village's history, with an interesting recounting of Jamestown's starving time that occurred during the winter of 1609-1610. When Elanor was 30, Francis Culpeper, now Mrs. William Berkley moved to Jamestown to take her position as the governor's wife. The two women became interested in the process of the 22 seat House of Burgesses. Elanor's accounts of the process are of the most accurate still existing today. Death Francis and Elanor liked to collect Indian arrowheads in the surrounding forests some afternoons, but on May 11, 1674 as the women wandered a village over to Middle Plantation, they were ambushed by the local Indians enraged at a misunderstanding that occurred earlier in the day. Elanor was killed but Francis was rescued by a few men of Middle Plantation, the ground of what is now Williamsburg. Elanor's death was significant because it helped spark Bacon's Rebellion that occurred in 1676 because of colonist that felt unsafe from Indian attacks.

Vizianagaram State was one of the most important zamindaris of the Madras Presidency in India.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 24, p. 339. The estate acceded to the Indian Union in 1949.Vizianagram (Zamindari) This area was ruled by different Hindu Emperors of Kuntal (Ancient Banaras) up to the mediaeval period. After the fall of centralised Gajapati Kingdom of Kalinga (most of present-day Odisha) the region was governed by the Ranchimore rulers. The ancestors of Maharajas of Vijyanagaram belong to descendants of Maharaja Veer Prataps clan, namely those are the same ancient Suryaveer ruling clan in Rajasthan and are ancestors who had built Vijayanagram. History The Pusapatis are the descendants of Pericchedis, the ancient ruling clan of Andhra Pradesh. Paricchedis were staunch patrons of Hindu Dharma in contrast to the Chalukyas, who initially were patrons of Jainism. The family name was changed to Pusapati after moving to the coastal region. The village Poosapaadu (పూసపాడు) (alternatively written Pusapadu in English) in Nandigama Taluq was built by Amala Raju, a descendant of Pericchedi clan Rulers. Rulers of this princely state hailed from Poosapaadu, hence they were known as Poosapaatis (పూసపాటి) (alternatively written Pusapati in English), meaning belonging to PoosaPaadu. Their surname is nothing but the adverbial form of noun Poosapaadu, their native place. It is obtained by suffixing a -ti ['t' spelt as in 'tea'] to the noun Poosapaadu according to the rules of Telugu grammar. They founded the city of Vizianagaram, named it after Vijay Rama Raju, spelled with a Z to differentiate it from the Vijayanagar Dynasty in Hampi. They obtained the title of Gajapati, after aiding the British forces of the Northern Circars against Vikram Dev I of Jeypore Kingdom in the 18th century. In 1754, Pusapati Vijaya Rama Gajapathi Raju, of the ruling family of Vizianagaram, made an alliance with the French, but a few years later the territory was ceded to the British. It remained under their control until independence in 1947. Vizianagaram Fort was constructed in the year 1712–1714 A.D. Traditionally five Vijayas or signs of victory were present at the inception of this fortress. It was named Vizia-nagaram (place of victory) after its founder Vijaya Rama Raju and the foundations were laid on Tuesday (Jayavaram in Telugu), the tenth day (Vijayadasami) of the Dasara Festival in the year Vijaya of the Hindu calendar. In 1827 Maharajah Vijay Rama Gajapati Raju III had several honors conferred on him by the British Government. Lord Northbrook obtained for him the title of His Highness, and had his name enrolled among those of chiefs entitled to return visits from the Viceroy. The revenue of the estate is nearly about 26lakhs by 1938 and nearly about 30 lakhs by the time of abolition. They paid a peskash of 4,96,580/- by 1877. After the Battle of Padmanabham they were reduced from the position of Princely State to Zamindari in 1794 and made the Permanent setllement in the year 1802-03.

The non-salute state came under the Deccan States Agency and was bordered by Hyderabad State and the Bombay Presidency. The area of the state was ; its population in 1901 was 82,047, while the population of Akkalkot town itself was 8,348 in that year. In 1911, the state enjoyed a revenue estimated at Rs.26,586/- and paid a tribute to the British Raj of Rs.1,000/-.History of Akkalkot State at www.akkalkothistoryandarmourymuseum.in History The ruling dynasty were descendants of Ranoji Lokhande, who was adopted by Chhattrapati Shahu, grandson of Shivaji, around the year 1708. Upon his adoption, Ranoji assumed the name 'Fatehsinh Bhonsle' and received in appenage the town of Akkalkot and surrounding areas. These estates remained a fief within the state of Satara until 1848, when the rulers of Satara (Chhatrapati Shahu's designated successors) were deposed by the British. Akkalkot then became one of several vassals of Satara to be recognised as separate princely states by the British Raj. The political history of the state is remarkable in having been altogether free of major incident. However, given their stability and association (by adoption) with the dynasty of Shivaji, the family came to be linked by marriage to nearly every major Maratha ruling family in India.Malleson, G. B.: An historical sketch of the native states of India, London 1875, Reprint Delhi 1984 Upon the termination of British rule in India in 1947, Akkalkot state acceded unto the Dominion of India, and was later merged with Bombay Presidency. Nirmalaraje Bhosale, wife of Vijayasinhrao Bhosale and a princess of Baroda by birth, served as Minister for States in the government of Bombay. =Rulers= The ruling chiefs of Akkalkot were: # 1707-1760 Fatehsinh I Raje Bhosle (born Ranoji Lokhande) # 1760-1789 Shahaji I (Bala Sahib) Raje Bhosle (nephew and adopted son of Fatehsinh I) # 1789-1822 Fatehsinh II (Appa Sahib) Raje Bhosle (son of predecessor) # 1822-1823 Maloji I (Baba Sahib) Raje Bhosle (son of predecessor) # 1823-1857 Shahaji II (Appa Sahib) Raje Bhosle (son of predecessor) # 1857-1870 Maloji II (Buwa Sahib) Raje Bhosle (son of predecessor) # 1870-1896 Shahaji III (Baba Sahib) Raje Bhosle (son of predecessor) # 1896-1923 Cpt.

She has adopted Majojirajea III Sanyuktaraje Bhosle, a patrilineal descendant of Shahaji I, as the legal heir to Akalkot state. #Majojiraje III Sanyuktaraje Bhosle, adopted heir of his predecessor Succession As in nearly all Hindu states, succession follows the salic law, is vested in the Bhosle dynasty, follows male primogeniture, and permits the ruler to adopt an heir from collateral branches of the Bhosle dynasty in case of the failure of the direct line. During the reign of Shahaji III, the direct line failed for the first time, and an heir was adopted from among the patrilineal descendants of Shahaji I. This was Raja Fatehsinh III, who was blessed with two sons but no legitimate grandson, and therefore the line failed again in 1965. At that point, Sumitrabai Bhosle, the elder daughter of Raja Jayasinhrao, assumed the regency of Akalkot pending the adoption of an heir. She has never married and remains in charge of the estate and princely legacy. In 2006, with the concurrence of her only sister, Sunita Bhosle (who is also unwed), she adopted Majoji Raje Bhosle (born in 1993 as Manaji Bhosle), a patrilineal descendant of Shahaji I, as her son and heir.

Jath State and Daphlapur State were the only two states belonging to the Bijapur Agency under the Bombay Presidency, which later became part of the Deccan States Agency. The state was founded in 1686 by the hereditary Patil (chief) of Daphlapur. Jath state (including Daphlapur) covered an area of , and had a population of 68,665 in 1901, while the population of Jath town itself was 5,414 in that year. The Raja was married to Princess Usharaje Gaekwad of Baroda who was the grand daughter of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad. History The Hindu ruling family of Jath State were Dafles of the Maratha Chavan clan, descendants of Lakhmajirao Yeldojirao Chavan, the Patil of Daphlapur. The Chavans traced their origin to Hindu Kshatriya Chauhan Rajput dynasty, Rajasthan. Lakhmajirao Yeldojirao Chavan entered the service of King Ali Adil Shah of Bijapur, and received a Desmukhi Watan of four Mahals in 1672. The Jagirs of Jath and Karajagi were conferred on his son in 1680. Emperor Aurangzeb confirmed these estates to the family in 1704. The male line failed four times during the state's history. Consequently, the state was either vested in widowed Ranis or ruled for them by regents for a total of seven decades. Together with the small state of Daphlapur, Jath State formed the Bijapur Agency, under the collector of Bijapur District. Daphlapur had an area of only 249 km² and was annexed by Jath State in the early 20th century owing to lack of succession. In 1911, the state enjoyed a revenue estimated at £24,000 and paid a tribute to the British Raj of £700.

These must be avoided, or can be rammed using nitrous. Causing them to crash will cause them to drop coins. Coins can also be earned by smashing through brick walls that reveal shortcuts in later races. The player can also use nitrous to cause opponents to crash as well. There are 10 tracks, each with their own theme and road conditions.

The coat of arms consisted of a shield in three parts; dexter, tenne a dexter fist holding two crossed arrows (points dexter) and a bow, all argent; sinister, argent a round shield sable bordured or, in the chief argent, a sword or pointed sinister.

Statue of Maharaja Yashwantrao Martandrao Mukne, last ruler of the Jawhar Maharani Priyamvande, last queen of the Jawhar Up to the first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan (1294) the greater part of the northern Konkan was held by Koli and Varli chiefs. Jawhar was held by a Varli chief and from him it passed to a Koli named Paupera. According to the Kolis' story, Paupera who was apparently called Jayaba, had a small mud fort at Mukne near the Tal pass. Once when visiting a shrine of Hazrat Sadruddin Chishti at Pimpri, he was blessed by five Koli mendicants and saluted as the ruler of Jawhar. Paupera thereupon collected a body of Kolis, marched northwards, and was acknowledged by the people of Peint and Dharampur. He went to Surat and as far north as Kathiawar where he remained for seven years. On his return from Kathiawar he went to Jawhar and asked the Varli chief to give him as much land as the hide of a bullock could cover. The Varli chief agreed, but when the hide was cut into fine shreds or strips, it enclosed the whole of the Varli chief's possessions. Gambhirgad about twelve miles north-west of Jawhar and the country round were given to the Varli chief, and Paupera became the sole master of Jawhar.https://gazetteers.maharashtra.gov.in/cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Thana%20District/Thane- II/jawhar.html#7 On 6 June 1306, Jayabha Mukne, a Poligar, took possession of the fort at Jawhar. His elder son, Dulbarrao, expanded his patrimony and conquered a large territory, controlling 22 forts, comprising most of the Nasik and Thana districts, and yielding annual revenues valued at £90,000. He received recognition as ruler by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq, receiving the new name of Nimshah and the hereditary title of Raja on 5 June 1343. This event was marked by the creation of a new calendar era used within the state for over six hundred years. The grandson of Nimshah, Deobarrao, fought a battle with the Bahmani Sultan Ahmad Shah I Wali. During his capture at Bidar, he fell in love with the Sultan's daughter. The marriage was solemnised after he converted to Islam and took the name Muhammad Shah. He returned to Jawhar and continued to rule his state unmolested, for the rest of his life. At his death, the powerful Hindu sardars and nobles refused to recognise his son as his successor, on account of his Muslim faith. In his stead, they chose the Hindu grandson of Holkarrao, the younger brother of Nimshah. Thereafter, his Hindu descendants ruled the little state in relative peace until the advent of the Maratha power. Raja Vikramshah I met Shivaji at Shirpaumal, during the latter's march to Surat and then joined him in the plunder of that city in 1664. However, he soon fell-out with the Marathas. From then on, the Marathas slowly and steadily tightened their grip on the Mukne rulers, annexing district after district and imposing ever-increasing taxes, levies and fines. They took control of the state in 1742, 1758 and 1761. Each time releasing control to the Mukne family on condition that territories were ceded and the tribute increased. In 1782 the Raja was allowed to retain for himself, a land- locked territory in the hills, yielding no more than £1,500 to £2,000 p.a. The advent of British rule brought a degree of stability unknown for more than a century. However, development was extremely slow, given the low level of revenue receipts and haphazard organisation of the administration. Little or no improvements were made until the reign of Patangshah IV. An enlightened and well-educated ruler, he immediately set about improving conditions, streamlining the government, building roads, schools and dispensaries. At his death in 1905, conditions had improved beyond measure. The relatively short reigns of Patangshah's two sons, Krishnashah V and Vikramshah V, also saw steady improvements. The last named was especially diligent in improving the agricultural sector, constructing wells, securing lad rights and improving the infrastructure of the state. He contributed substantially towards the war effort during the Great War, and received a 9-gun salute in recognition of his services. His early death in 1926 ushered in a ten-year regency for his son, Yeshwantrao Patangshah V. The latter assumed full ruling powers in 1938, having received perhaps the best education by any member of his family. He continued the good work achieved under the regency by expanding development activity, encouraging the chemical, paper, textile, dyeing, printing, liquor and starch industries. The state provided free primary schooling and medical relief, ran both middle and high schools, a central library and museum, hospital and maternity home, and provided touring dispensaries for the rural areas. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Raja immediately volunteered for service and served for four years with the RIAF. Yeshwantrao Patangshah V assumed the title of Maharaja, shortly before he signed the instrument of accession to the Dominion of India in 1947. He then merged his state into the Bombay Presidency early in the following year. The Maharaja Medal (Maharaja Padak), awarded in a single class, was instituted by Maharaja Yeshwantrao Patangshah V in 1947 to commemorate his assumption of the title of Maharaja and to reward those who had served the state during his reign. Patangshah V then embarked on a political career, was a member of the national parliament and the state assembly. He died in 1978 and was succeeded by his only son, Digvijaysinhrao. The latter died in 1992, leaving his only son, Mahendrasinhrao, to represent his line.

The state was founded in 1665 and had its capital in Banganapalle. Its rulers were Shia Muslims and the last one signed the accession to the Indian Union on 23 February 1948. History The fortified village of Banganapalle emerges from obscurity in 1601, when Sultan Ismail Adil Shah of Bijapur is recorded to have displaced the previous ruler, Raja Nanda Chakravarthy, and taken possession of the fortress. Several decades later, Banganapalle was part of a large province which the Sultan of Bijapur placed under the control of his trusted general, Siddi Sambal. The Siddi, a man of African extraction, is credited with having significantly improved the fortifications of Banganapalle. In 1665, Sultan Adil Shah II of Bijapur granted Banganapalle and the surrounding areas as a Jagir (fiefdom) to Muhammad Beg Khan-e-Rosebahani, as a reward for services rendered. Rosebahani died without male heirs, and left the estate in the control of his adopted son and namesake, Muhammad Beg Khan Najm-i-Sani, entitled Faiz Ali Khan Bahadur. Faiz Ali and his brother Fazl Ali were officers under the Bijapur Sultan, and had come into contact with Rosebahani in that capacity. According to some sources, Faiz Ali was the son of a daughter of Rosebahani. In either case, the inheritance was not strictly legal, but the times were very unstable, and control was more important than legal niceties. In 1686, the Sultanate of Bijapur was extinguished after being defeated by the Mughals under Aurangzeb. By a fortuitous coincidence, Aurangzeb's viceroy of the Deccan, Mubariz Khan, was none other than a maternal uncle of Faiz Ali Khan. The fief of Banganapalle was secured to Faiz Ali Khan by the intervention of Mubariz Khan. However, Faiz Ali Khan also died with surviving male issue Banganapalle was ruled by the descendants of Faiz Ali Khan initially as a fief of the Mughal empire, and after the Nizam of Hyderabad declared his independence from the Mughals in 1724, as a fief of Hyderabad. Faiz Ali Khan also died without a male heir, and Banganapalle was inherited by his grandson, Husain Ali Khan. Toward the end of Husain Ali Khan's reign, Hyder Ali of Mysore was expanding his power in the region, and Husain Ali Khan switched his allegiance to Hyder Ali. Husain Ali Khan died in 1783, and his young son, Ghulam Muhammad Ali, succeeded him, with his paternal uncle as regent. Within the space of a year, Hyder's successor Tipu Sultan had driven them from Banganapalle; they took refuge in Hyderabad, returning to reclaim Banganapalle in 1789. Shortly thereafter, the nearby jagir of Chenchelimala was acquired by the Nawab of Banganapalle through marriage. Banganapalle became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century. The British governor of the Madras Presidency twice took over the administration of the state for financial mismanagement, the first time from 1832 to 1848, and the second time for a few months in 1905. In 1901, the princely state of Banganapalle had a population of 32,264 and an area of 660 km² (255 sq. mi.). In 1948, the ruler of Banganapalle acceded to newly independent India, and Banganapalle was incorporated into Kurnool district of the then Madras Presidency. In 1953, the northern districts of Madras State, including Kurnool District, became the new state of Andhra, which in 1956 became Andhra Pradesh =Rulers= Between c. 1665 and 1876 the rulers of Banganapalle State had the title \\"Kiladar\\".Princely States of India A-J Kiladars *1665 - 1686 Muhammad Beg Khan (d. c.1686) *1686 - 1725 Muhammad Beg Khan-i-lung (d. 1725) *1725 - 1728 Ata Khan (d. 1728) *1728 - 1737 Fazil \`Ali Khan I (d. 1737) *1737 - 1769 Fazil \`Ali Kahn II (d. 1769) *7 Apr 1769 – 26 Aug 1783 Saiyid Husain Ali Khan (d. 1783) (personal style Khan Bahadur) *1784 - 1790 Muhammad Yusuf -Mysore Administrator *1790 - 1814 Mozaffar al-Molk Asad \`Ali Khan - jointly with following: **1790 - 8 Sep 1822 Gholam \`Ali Khan I (d. 1825) **8 Sep 1822 - 1831 Hosayn \`Ali Khan (1st time) (d. 1848) **12 Jul 1848 - 1848 Hosayn \`Ali Khan (2nd time) (s.a.) **1848 - 7 Oct 1868 Gholam Mohammad \`Ali Khan II (d. 1868) **7 Oct 1868 – 24 Jan 1876 Fath \`Ali Khan (b. 1849 - d. 1905) Nawabs *24 Jan 1876 – 21 Apr 1905 Fath \`Ali Khan (s.a.) *21 Apr 1905 – 22 Jan 1922 Gholam \`Ali Khan III (b. 1874 - d. 1922) *21 Apr 1905 – 12 Dec 1908 John Chartres Molony -Regent (b. 1877 - d. 1948) *22 Jan 1922 – 15 Aug 1947 Fadli \`Ali Khan III (b. 1901 - d. 1948) (forced to reside outside state 1939-1947) See also *Nawab of Masulipatam *Masulipatam *Nizam of Hyderabad *Formation of Andhra Pradesh References Category:Princely states of India Category:Muslim princely states of India Category:Shia dynasties Category:History of Andhra Pradesh Category:People from Kurnool district ","title":"Banganapalle State"},{"id":"30540379","title":"General der Flakartillerie"},{"id":"30540389","text":"Jobat StateImperial Gazeteer of India, v. 5, p. 223. was a princely state in India during the British Raj.

It extends from Lille Triangel at the north- eastern tip of The Lakes, passes Trianglen, and continues to Svanemøllen station from where it becomes Strandvejen. History The beginning of Østerbrogade painted by Christen Købke in 1836. Østerbrogade originated as the old main road which extended from the Eastern City Gate, paradoxically located north of the city. Originally it was simply known as Østerbro and the name only referred to the stretch between the city gate and present day Trianglen where it continued as Strandvejen (English: The Beach Road) along the coast. After the city gate was dismantled in 1859 and the city was gradually allowed to develop beyond the old fortifications, still more of the old main road was included in Østerbrogade until it finally reached all the way to its present- day terminus at Svanemøllen in 1949. Redevelopment of the area along the road began in 1854 when the Danish Medical Association built the Brumleby terraced houses to provide cheap and healthy housing for indigent workers. In 1857 the first apartment building was built at Trianglen. St. James' Church was built just north of Brumleby from 1872 to 1878. In 1961, the part of Østerbrogade closest to the city centre, from Østerport Station to Lille Trianglen, was renamed Dag Hammarskjölds Allé but the continuous numbering was retained. Notable buildings and residents Østerfælled Torv is a result of a redevelopment of the former Østerfælled Barracks into a mixed-use development surrounding a public space. Brumleby (No. 55A) is an enclave of terraced houses built in two stages in 1854-1872\\\\. These are the oldest surviving buildings in Østerbro. Built for indigent workers by the Danish Medical Association, it is one of the earliest examples of social housing in Denmark and became a model for later projects. The oldest part of the development was designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll. Next to it, on both sides of Olufgade, is one of the developments of the Workers' Co-Operative Building Society. It consists of 49 terraced houses built 1874-1877 to design by Frederik Bøttger. The development was designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll and Vilhelm Klein in Neoclassical style.

A further 1995 excavation by University of La Plata archaeologist Dr. Laura Miotti made a carbon dating analysis possible, and led to the discovery that its human fossil remains date from approximately 11,000 years ago.Welcome Argentina: Expediciones Arqueológicas en Los Toldos y en Piedra Museo The site, located 250 km (150 mi) from Pico Truncado, in Deseado Department (Santa Cruz Province), is among the oldest archaeological remains uncovered in the Americas. Its discoveries included that of spear heads that contained traces of mylodon and hippidion, among other animals known to have been extinct since at least 10000 BC. Its original inhabitants, the Toldense people, were hunter gatherers that subsisted on these and other prey, such as rhea and guanacos. Piedra Museo, like Pedra Furada (Brazil), Monte Verde (Chile), Topper, and the Meadowcroft Rockshelter (United States), in turn have led to alternative theories to that of the \\"Clovis First\\" hypothesis on the settlement of the Americas (the assumption, based on lacking evidence to the contrary, that the Clovis culture was the first in the Western Hemisphere).Smithsonian: Paleoamerican Origins Fossils from Piedra Museo, as well as artifacts and petroglyphs from the nearby Los Toldos site, are housed in the Pico Truncado Regional Museum of History.

Thomasz Albrecht administer each parish, along with associate deacons and staff.  History of St. Mary's Church  St. Mary's Church is the oldest Catholic church in eastern Connecticut. Originally built in 1845 to support the religious needs of immigrant Irish workers, St. Mary's Church grew and accepted new demographics of Catholics. The small Polish community eventually left St. Mary's to establish their own church, and St. Mary's now serves the spiritual needs of all area Catholics, including those from Puerto Rico, Haiti, Portugal, and other Latin American countries. The seven sacraments aren celebrated in English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese. The 90-year old St. Anthony Chapel inside the church is a popular among new and current Portuguese Catholics arriving from Cape Verde. The St. Anthony Chapel bears the Portuguese inscription \\"A Chapel to St. Anthony, Baptized 4th day of July 1926\\" over its entrance. While it fell into disrepair from 1926–1976, in 1977 the chapel was restored with the blessing of the Bishop of Norwich, the Most Rev. Daniel P. Reilly, and Rev. Thomas Bride. A Capela do Santo Antonio, Inc., a non-profit, 501 c(3) exempt organization, was established to collect grants and donations. In 2003, the chapel was listed on the State Register of Historic Places by the Connecticut Historical Commission.  History of St. Joseph Church, Saints Peter and Paul Church, and the Joint Norwich Catholic Cluster  St. Joseph Church was established in 1904, with Lithuanian priest Fr. John Ambot, for Polish immigrants who had moved from the St. Mary's Church community. in 1911, Fr. Ignatius Maciejewski supervised the addition of a convent and school under the stewardship of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. The current St. Joseph Church structure was built in 1962, where Polish traditions are emphasized in the parish's liturgical worship. The parish also cooperates with St. Vincent de Paul Place to minister to impoverished communities. Ss. Peter and Paul Church was built in 1938 to improve accessibility to Catholic worship in West Norwich, CT, where the church building sits on an open park.

Other source points out just 40 000 m² of (probable) GFA, since \\"efficient open-space\\" of 1 150 m² a floor (cited there as well) gives a total of 32 200 m², in which case Capital Fort covers Class A requirements, regarding parking spaces. The building is not purely an office one, having retail and conference functions as well.

Opened in 1893, it forms part of the Bologna–Ancona railway, and is also a terminus of two secondary railways, linking Faenza with Lavezzola and with Ravenna, and with Florence, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Faenza railway station is situated at Piazza Cesare Battisti, at the northern edge of the city centre. History Faenza's original station was opened on 1 September 1861, together with the rest of the Bologna–Forlì section of the Bologna–Ancona railway. It was located to the east of the present station, near what is now Via Caldesi. In 1893, upon the inauguration of the Faentina railway to Florence, the present station was opened to replace the original station. However, the relocation of the station to a less central site necessitated the construction of a road link (Viale Alfredo Beccarini) between the city centre and the new facility. This led to the destruction of the city walls, and the distortion of the fabric of the urban village of Ganga. The 1893 passenger building was later destroyed by a bombing raid during World War II. It was rebuilt in 1948 by architect Roberto Narducci, who had already rebuilt several railway stations in the post-war period. In 2009, Centostazioni and RFI completed a general restructuring of the property and the adaptation of technological systems in accordance with legal requirements. The proposed Metropolis project of the comune of Faenza would reclassify the space outside the station, and particularly the goods yard. It would also involve the construction of new housing estates (approximately 30,000 cubic meters in volume), and a new bus terminal and bike paths. Features =Passenger building= The passenger building is constructed in an evidently Italian rationalist style typical of the stations designed by Narducci. It is shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped on two levels. At ground floor level, there are two large openings with rectangular sides. Upstairs, a large window illuminates and atrium inside the building. Extending laterally from each side of the passenger building are two asymmetrical single storey buildings in brick. These house the equipment rooms and the restaurant and bar. Beyond the outer end of each of these two buildings, there is another building on three levels, not open to travellers. =Station yard= Adjacent to the passenger building is the station yard. It has seven tracks used for passenger services. In detail: *Track 1: on the main Faentina line, is used by Faentina line trains; *Track 2: a loop siding, is also part of the Faentina line; *Track 3: on the main Bologna–Ancona line, is generally used by even-numbered stopping trains (heading north); *Track 4: also on the main Bologna–Ancona line, is generally used by odd-numbered stopping trains (southbound); *Tracks 5, 6 and 7: are loop sidings generally used for trains terminating in Faenza, or for any overtaking. All passenger tracks have a platform sheltered by a canopy. The platforms are connected with each other by a pedestrian underpass. There are also other tracks (without platforms and forming a separate area with similar tracks) used for the storage of rolling stock not in service. The rolling stock stored there includes many ALn 668 1900 series railcars, and several Minuetto series diesel multiple units. Both of these types are used on the lines radiating from Faenza. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): (incomplete) *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara (- Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce) (only two Frecciabianca trains call at Faenza every day) *Inter City Services Milan - Lodi - Piacenza - Fidenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Modena - Bologna - Faenza - Forlì - Cesena - Rimini - Riccione - Pesaro - Fano - Senigallia - Ancona - Civitanova Marche - San Benedetto del Tronto - Giulianova - Pescara - Vasto - Termoli - San Severo - Foggia - Barletta - Trani - Bisceglie - Molfetta - Bari/ - Brindisi - Lecce/Taranto *Local (Regional) Services Faenza - Brisighella - Marradi - Borgo San Lorenzo - Vaglia - Florence *Local (Regional) Services \\"Piacenza - Fidenza - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Modena - Bologna - Castel San Pietro Terme - Imola - Castel Bolognese - Faenza - Forlì - Cesena - Rimini - Riccione - Cattolica - Pesaro - Fano - Senigallia - Ancona (trains also leave from Milan and arrive in Pescara) *Local (Regional) Services Faenza - Granarolo Faentino - Russi - Godo - Ravenna (used also by the trains R (Regional) 21457 Firenze Santa Maria Novella - Ravenna and Summer Season Regional Train Firenze Santa Maria Novella - Firenze Campo Marte - Pontassieve - Vicchio - Borgo San Lorenzo - Marradi - Brisighella - Faenza - Ravenna - Lido di Classe - Cervia - Cesenatico - Bellaria - Rimini) *Local (Regional) Services Faenza - Granarolo Faentino - Cotignola - Lugo - Sant'Agata sul Santerno - Massalombarda - San Patrizio - Conselice - Lave)zzola (infrequently used due to lack of proper passenger traffic from Faenza to Lavezzola, mainly used by commuters and students attending schools in Lugo and Faenza.

He accompanied Ferdinand on the ill-fated Portuguese campaign to conquer Tangier from Marinid Morocco in 1437. To preserve his army from destruction, Prince Henry the Navigator, commander of the expedition, signed a treaty that agreed to deliver Ceuta (captured by the Portuguese earlier in 1415) back to Morocco. Henry handed over his brother Ferdinand to the Marinids as a noble hostage to ensure the delivery of Ceuta. As a member of his household, Álvares accompanied Ferdinand into Moroccan captivity.Russell, 2000:p.184 As it turns out, the Portuguese refused to honor the treaty and deliver Ceuta, with the result that Ferdinand was left in Marinid captivity, first at Asilah, then at Fez, where he eventually died in 1443. However, Álvares was successfully ransomed in 1448, five years after his master's death.Álvares, Chronica, p.347 He returned to Morocco in 1450 to ransom remaining captives and to collect the relics of Ferdinand, who was now starting to be religiously cultivated as the Holy Prince (Infante Santo) in Portugal.Álvares, Chronica, p.347-48 After returning to Portugal, Prince Henry commissioned Álvares to draft a chronicle of Ferdinand's life. Written by Álvares between 1451 and 1460 and first published in Lisbon in 1527, it is one of the few eyewitness accounts of the Battle of Tangiers and the captivity of Ferdinand. Its details are often at odds with the account of official royal chronicler Rui de Pina and, despite being commissioned by Henry, often unflattering of Henry's leadership during the Tangier campaign.Russell, 2000:p.193 Intended as Christian hagiography to promote the saintly cult of Ferdinand, Álvares's chronicle details Ferdinand's patient endurance of the humiliations and sufferings he underwent in Moroccan captivity. But Álvares refrains from endorsing the popular view that Ferdinand had volunteered for martyrdom, making it reasonably clear that Ferdinand originally expected the treaty to be honored and his release to be secured swiftly.Russell, 2000: p.184 Sometime before 1460, Álvares accompanied Isabella of Portugal (Duchess of Burgundy) to Flanders. He is also known to have traveled to Rome in 1470, seeking spiritual indulgences attached to the veneration of Ferdinand. João Álvares was a member of the military order of the Knights of St. Benedict of Aviz and in 1461 was named commendatory abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Paço de Sousa (near Penafiel in northern Portugal). He translated several religious works into Portuguese, including the first edition of The Imitation of Christ of Thomas à Kempis. He died in Paço de Sousa around 1490.

The band consisted of members Joel Kanitz, Ryan Gose, Alex Silverman, and Sean Silverman. In February 2014, Alex Silverman announced his departure from the group. In May 2015, the band announced that following the release of their next album Soul Sucker, they would be playing a final tour and retiring the band so members could \\"pursue each our passions and musical projects\\". The band has released three full-length albums: Soul Sucker, Biography of Heartbreak, and Sound of Fire. History =Beginnings (2006–2007)= The band was formed while most of the members were attending high school. They experimented with several names such as \\"Modern Poets\\" and kept this name for two shows before changing it to \\"Evident Earth\\". They finally decided on \\"This Century\\" after guitarist Silverman jokingly said they're \\"lucky if we come up with a band name some time this century\\". =Early EPs (2007–2009)= In 2007, This Century released their first EP titled 2007. They continued releasing EPs and singles throughout the years, including Look What We Made (2008), \\"Dream of Christmas\\" (2008), \\"Kiss Me Like It's Christmas\\" (2009), No Way Out Digital Sampler (2009), and To Love and Back (2009). In 2008, they were signed under Tim Kirch and Tanner Radcliffe at Eighty One Twenty Three Management, and later performed acoustic sets at the Baby Cakes Tent during the 2009 Vans Warped Tour. =Tours and Sound of Fire (2010–2012)= In 2010, This Century was signed to The Maine's Action Theory Records. They then released the EP Hopeful Romantic (2010) consisting of three sampler tracks due to be on their debut album Sound of Fire.

The entire album was released on April 19, 2011. In mid-2011, This Century held their first headlining tour, the \\"Young and Useless Tour\\", with Cartel Hulsey and Austin Gibbs. Due to personal events, Austin Gibbs dropped halfway through the tour and singer-songwriter Sweet Talker replaced Gibbs on select dates. In June 2012, This Century played a show in Manila, Philippines together with We Are the In Crowd and Set Your Goals. \\"Everywhere Everything\\", a song from their debut album, Sound of Fire, made its way to the top of the charts in Manila for two weeks, while the song \\"Sound of Fire\\" also made its way to the top of the charts in June 2011. This Century had headline The Endless Summer Tour with Austin Gibbs and made a new song with him called, \\"Someone For Everyone.\\" This Century opened for The Maine's UK/Europe Pioneer tour in September 2012 and they returned to Manila December 9–10, 2012, for a free concert sponsored by Pulp magazine. =Biography of Heartbreak, Soul Sucker, and final tour (2013–2016)= This Century released their sophomore album Biography of Heartbreak worldwide on May 14, 2013, via Rude Records in Europe, UK, Southeast Asia, Australia and Japan, and independently in the US in partnership with their management team Eighty One Twenty Three.

She was an 11th generation descendant of General Yun Gwan (윤관). She was the second wife of King Seongjong, and mother of King Yeonsangun. In a first time, she was a Royal Noble Consort of the King, and became Queen consort after the death of Queen Gonghye, the previous Queen. The ousting of Lady Yun in 1479, and her subsequent death by poison in 1482 became a source of recurrent political turmoil, culminating with the First literati purge organized in 1498 by Yeonsangun in the 4th year of his reign.

In a first time, she was a concubine of Seongjong, receiving the name Suk-ui Yun-ssi 숙의 윤씨. In 1474, Queen Gonghye of Han died. She was Seongjong's first regular wife. With no royal heir, the king was urged by counselors to take a second wife to secure the royal succession. Lady Yun was chosen as Queen Consort for her beauty,Such was her beauty that it was said to resemble Princess Noguk's face. From the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, entry dated 1497, during the 3rd year of her son's rule. and was instated in 1476. Several months later, she gave birth to her first son, Yi Yung, later to become King Yeonsangun of Joseon. The new queen proved to be temperamental and highly jealous of Seongjong's remaining concubines, even stooping to poisoning one of them in 1477. One night in 1479, she clawed the king, leaving visible scratch marks on his face. King Seongjong tried to conceal the injury, but his mother, Queen Dowager Insu, discovered the truth and ordered Lady Yun to be deposed and sent into exile. After several rehabilitation attempts initiated by her party, influential government officials petitioned for her execution. She was sentenced to death and poisoned shortly thereafter. The manner and matter of her death became a pretext for her son to purge the court and government of opponents and critics of his rule.

The unit was originally commanded by Colonel T. D. Merrick, who had formerly held the rank of Major General of the Arkansas Militia and who carried Governor Rector's demand for the surrender of the Little Rock Arsenal to its commander in February 1861. The regiment was armed with weapons which the state confiscated when the Federal Arsenal at Little Rock was seized by Arkansas State Militia troops in February 1861. Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy, but from various records it can be surmised that the 9th and 10th Arkansas, Kelly's 9th Arkansas Battalion, and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry were all issued flintlock Hall breechloading rifles from the Arsenal.Ezell, Tom, \\"Re: Van Dorn- Army of the Southwest\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 17 December 2001, Accessed 11 June 2012, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=545  Battles  Captain William W Martin, Company A, \\"Quitman Rifles\\" 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment The 10th Arkansas moved to Union City, Tennessee, where 150 men died from the effects of measles. The regiment was assigned to General Bowen's Brigade, consisting of the 9th and 10th Arkansas, 5th Missouri and 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiments before they were moved to Kentucky. They remained at Bowling Green, Kentucky, until the evacuation of that place when they were placed to guard the rear on the retreat. After the losses of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. and then retreated through western Tennessee to Corinth, Mississippi. On March 29, 1862, the Army of Central Kentucky was merged into the Army of Mississippi in preparation for the Battle of Shiloh. Bowen's Brigade, including the 9th and 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiments, was then placed in General Brigadier General John C. Breckinridge's Reserve Corps as part of the Army of Mississippi. The 10th Arkansas fought on the Confederate right flank at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862, participating in the many vicious attacks against the \\"Hornet's Nest\\" which ultimately led to the surrender of Prentiss's division. The 10th's final attack ended around dark when they ran up against Grant's Last Line. At this same time, Confederate attacks were called off until the next day. The 10th Arkansas lost about 160 men at Shiloh. After the Battle of Shiloh, the regiment, withdrew to Corinth, Mississippi, where they reorganized.United States. War Department.

In early May 1862, Confederate forces underwent an army- wide reorganization due to the passage of the Conscription Act by the Confederate Congress in April 1862.UPTON, EMORY, Bvt. Maj.

Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge. The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, following the Battle of Shiloh. The 10th Arkansas was reduced to eight companies in April 1862 by transferring the personnel of Company F to Company C and dividing Company I among all the other companies. Formal charges related to the disorganized condition of his regiment were brought against Colonel Merrick. He resigned and on May 27, 1862, and Captain A. R. Witt of Company A, was promoted to colonel and became commander of the regiment. In October 1862, the regiment contained 249 effectives. The regiment moved near Vicksburg, Mississippi, where they stayed some time on the Yazoo River, at Camp Price. Then they were moved to Vicksburg, where they stayed a short while. They were placed in a brigade commanded by General Jeff Thompson, and moved to Louisiana, above New Orleans, where they spent the winter of 1862–63 guarding the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railway. By the early spring of 1863, the 10th Arkansas was sent again to Baton Rouge where they were to prepare defenses against the approaching General N. P. Banks. This they did by felling large numbers of trees to block the roadways leading to Baton Rouge, digging trenches and mounting siege guns around the city. By 1 March 1863, the 10th Arkansas Infantry was at Port Hudson, Louisiana, above New Orleans and during March 7–27 as part of a force under General Franklin Gardner, they were in operations against Federal forces at Port Hudson. After a series of engagements lasting into July, 1863, the 10th Arkansas Infantry, was surrendered with the garrison by General Gardner to Union General N. P. Banks. The 10th apparently continued to have internal problems during the siege of Port Hudson. Certain officers of the 10th Arkansas apparently influenced some enlisted men to desert and refuse to alternate duties with their fellow companies. By July 7, just two days before the garrison capitulated, there was practically open mutiny. On July 9, 1863, the garrison surrendered and the 10th Arkansas became prisoners of war. The men were paroled until exchanged, with the officers were imprisoned at Johnson's Island, Ohio, in Lake Erie. The unit was eventually exchanged and returned to Arkansas. Col. A. R. Witt reorganized the unit, including some newly recruited members to form Witt's Arkansas Cavalry. The Regiment was assigned to the following higher commands while it served east of the Mississippi River:Tenth Arkansas, Civil War Units History, Ancestry.com, Accessed 14 March 2012, http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~arcivwar/tenthar.htm *October 31, 1861 – Sixth Brigade – First Division – Western Department. *November 30, 1861 – Second Brigade – Fourth Division – Western Department. *January 31, 1862 – Bowen's Brigade – Floyd's Division – Central Army of Kentucky. *February 22, 1862 – Second Brigade – Third Division – Central Army of Kentucky, Western Department. *April 6, 1862 – Second Brigade – Reserve Corps – Army of the Mississippi. *March 31, 1863 – Buford's Brigade – Third Military District – Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. *April 30, 1863 – Maxey's Brigade – Third Military District – Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. Like almost all Civil War units, the regiment was frequently known by an alternate designation derived from the name of the unit's commanding officer. The regiment participated in the following engagements during its career as an infantry regiment east of the Mississippi River: *Battle, Pittsburg Landing, Shiloh, Tennessee - April 6–7, 1862. *Engagement, Baton Rouge, Louisiana - August 5, 1862. *Operations against expedition from Pass Manchac and Ponchatuoula, Louisiana - September 13–15, 1862, *Skirmish, Bayou Bonfonca, Louisiana - November 21, 1862. *Port Hudson Campaign **Operations against Port Hudson, Louisiana - March 7–27, 1863. **Action, Plain's Store, Louisiana - May 21, 1863. **Siege, Port Hudson, Louisiana - May 24–July 9, 1863. **Assault, Port Hudson, Louisiana - May 27, 1863. **Assault, Port Hudson, Louisiana - June 14, 1863. **Surrender, Port Hudson, Louisiana - July 9, 1863. = Witt's 10th Arkansas Cavalry = Witt's Arkansas Cavalry, commanded by Colonel A. R. Witt, was composed primarily of men who had served with the Tenth Arkansas Infantry, been captured at Port Hudson, Louisiana, and after being exchanged, returned to Arkansas. Though the veterans of the 10th Arkansas Infantry were the backbone of the new unit, Colonel Witt also conducted extensive recruiting outside the immediate area of Springfield and Conway County. Most of the men in companies C, D, and G were raised in nearby Clinton [Van Buren County]; nine of the unit's twenty-one company grade officers were from that town as well. A few recruits were also found in Batesville, Searcy, Carrollton, Jacksonport, and Austin. Some were veterans of other regiments.Dirck, Brian. \\"Witt's Cavalry: An Arkansas Guerrilla Unit\\", Faulkner Facts and Fiddlings, Fall and Winter, 1994, Nos. 3-4, pp. 63-76, Accessed 11 May 2012, http://www.faulknerhistory.com/articles/WittsCavalry.htm On numerous occasions, the unit served behind Federal lines. A Federal report indicated that it often employed female sympathizers to spy on Federal installations and troop movements, reporting the information obtained back to the command. One of these spies was reported to be operating in Little Rock in mid-November, 1864. The unit served unattached throughout its career, with the exception of Price's Missouri Expedition in late 1864. During this time it was attached to Major General Fagan's division of Arkansas Troops. The unit took part in the following engagements as a mounted force in the Department of the Tran-Mississippi: *Skirmishes, Clear Creek and Tomahawk, Arkansas, January 22, 1864. *Skirmish, Rolling Prairie, Arkansas, January 23, 1864. *Skirmish, Sylamore Creek, Arkansas, January 23, 1864. *Skirmishes near Burrowsville, Arkansas, January 23, 1864. *Skirmish, Crooked Creek, Arkansas, February 5, 1864. *Skirmish, Bayou Des Arc, Arkansas, July 13–16, 1864. *Skirmish, Gum Swamp, Arkansas, July 17, 1864. *Skirmish, Austin, Arkansas, July 17, 1864. *Camden Expedition, Arkansas, March–May, 1864. *Price's Missouri Raid, Arkansas-Missouri-Kansas, September–October, 1864. **Skirmish near Quitman, Arkansas (detachment), September 2, 1864. **Battle of Fort Davidson, Missouri, September 27, 1864. **Fourth Battle of Boonville, Missouri, October 11, 1864. **Battle of Glasgow, Missouri, October 15, 1864. **Battle of Sedalia, Missouri, October 15, 1864. **Second Battle of Lexington, Missouri, October 19, 1864. **Battle of Little Blue River, Missouri, October 21, 1864. **Second Battle of Independence, Missouri, October 21–22, 1864. **Battle of Byram's Ford, Missouri, October 22–23, 1864. **Battle of Westport, Missouri, October 23, 1864. **Battle of Marais des Cygnes, Linn County, Kansas, October 25, 1864. **Battle of Mine Creek, Missouri, October 25, 1864. **Battle of Marmiton River, Missouri, October 25, 1864. **Second Battle of Newtonia, Missouri, October 28, 1864. **Skirmish near Lewisburg, Arkansas – February 12, 1865.Taylor, Larry \\"Skirmish at Lewisburg\\" Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Accessed 12 May 2012, http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=6842 Unlike most of the units which accompanied Price after the Missouri expedition, Witt's Cavalry did not retreat all the way to northeastern Texas.

Jeff Thompson, commander of the Military Sub-District of Northeast Arkansas and Southeast Missouri. Thompson formally surrendered his command at Chalk Bluff, Arkansas, on May 11, 1865, and agreed to have his men assemble at Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. At the time, Thompson's command was widely dispersed throughout northeast Arkansas, mainly for reasons of available forage. Colonel Witt, who had continued to operate in the vicinity of Quitman, wrote to Major General Reynolds, commander of Union forces in the Department of Arkansas, on May 18, 1865, stating his intention to surrender and help restore order in the area.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Surrender of the 10th Arkansas (Witt's Cav)\\", Posted 14 March 2012, Accessed 14 March 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=25864 Colonel Witt and the survivors of the 10th Arkansas Mounted Infantry surrendered and were paroled at Jacksonport on June 5, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Jacksonport 1865 surrender list?\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 January 2004, Accessed 1 January 2012, http://history- sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=6006 Most of the men on the Jacksonport parole lists actually served in the 10th Arkansas regiment, but some were attached to various companies simply for the purpose of surrendering.

It took place close to the village of Krzykawka near Olkusz. The Polish forces were led by general Józef Miniewski and included the Italian Garibaldi Legion under the command of Francesco Nullo. The outcome of the engagement was a victory for the Russian forces. Background Francesco Nullo, a fighter for the Italian reunification, was also a supporter of the Polish cause. Nullo, with a selected cadre of volunteers (sometimes known as the Garibaldi Legion), reached Kraków in April 1863. They were incorporated into the unit of colonel Józef Miniewski. The Legion crossed the borders of Congress Poland on the night of May the 3rd and the 4th near Ostrężnica and Czyżówka, after organizing in Krzeszowice. Early in the morning of the 4th the unit's first battle in Poland occurred at Podłęże where it defeated a Russian force (the garrison from Olkusz). With a Polish unit commanded by colonel Miniewski, he marched on Olkusz. NULLO Francesco (1826-63) In the night of May the 4th to 5th or in the early morning of May the 5th they reached Krzykawka, where they set up a camp. Battle Soon after setting a camp on the morning of the 5th the insurgents were attacked by Russian troops coming from Olkusz. Miniewski was the overall Polish commander. Nullo commanded the right wing, and count Czapski, the left. The insurgents numbered about 600 soldiers, divided into four companies; the unit had only a dozen or so cavalrymen. Polish forces included the twenty or so Italians from the Garibaldi's Legion and several French volunteers, remnants of the Zouaves of Death. Russian forces were composed of three companies (7th and 9th companies of the Vitebsk Infantry Regiment and the 4th Company of the 7th Riflemen Battalion) and were commanded by prince Szachowski, commander of the Olkusz garrison. At first, both sides kept at distance, about 250 meters, and exchanged sporadic fire. Nullo, worried that the Russians may be trying to outflank the insurgents, ordered a charge. In the first stage of the battle, the insurgents pushed the Russian troops back in close fighting; but subsequent Russian reinforcements consisting of three companies turned the tide and the insurgents and their foreign allies suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat. WIEM Encyklopedia, Nullo Francesco The battle lasted until two in the afternoon. Nullo was mortally injured, hit by a Cossack bullet while preparing (or leading - sources vary) a charge he ordered; he had only time to whisper, in Bergamo dialect:So' mort! (I'm dead).

It has neuroprotective, analgesic, and anti-Parkinsonian effects in animal studies. Traxoprodil has been researched in humans as a potential treatment to lessen the damage to the brain after stroke, but results from clinical trials showed only modest benefit. The drug was found to cause EKG abnormalities (QT prolongation) and its clinical development was stopped. More recent animal studies have suggested traxoprodil may exhibit rapid-acting antidepressant effects similar to those of ketamine, although there is some evidence for similar psychoactive side effects and abuse potential at higher doses, which might limit clinical acceptance of traxoprodil for this application. Traxoprodil showed ketamine-like rapidly-acting antidepressant effects in a small clinical trial of 30 patients with depression who were non-responders to 6 weeks of paroxetine treatment. The response rate was 60%, relative to 20% for placebo, and 33% of the participants met remission criteria by day five following a single administration. After one week, 78% of responders still showed an antidepressant response, and after 15 days, 42% did so. In the study, half of the participants had to have their dose lowered due to a high incidence of dissociative side effects at the higher doses. Development was stopped due to incidence of QTc prolongation. Other NR2B subunit-selective antagonists of the NMDA receptor are still under development for depression, such as rislenemdaz (CERC-301, MK-0657).

Stevens began his military career as a lieutenant colonel in the 1775 Battle of Great Bridge where he commanded a battalion of riflemen,Rogers, 373. the Culpeper Minutemen.Wilson, 17. Stevens distinguished himself in the battle and was given a command as colonel of the 10th Virginia Regiment. Stevens raised and equipped his regiment and marched to rendezvous with General George Washington, his direct commander.Rogers, 374. Stevens's command had their first engagement at the Battle of Brandywine where the regiment did not enter the battle until the American forces had begun to retreat. Stevens troops covered the retreat and prevented the British from pursuing. Stevens received the public praise of Washington after both Brandywine and the subsequent Battle of Germantown. Stevens became a Brigadier General in the Virginia Militia. Stevens saw his first action as a general at the Battle of Camden. Before the battle Stevens complained that his \\"militia will not be satisfied with what regular troops well off with.\\"Russel, 165. At the council of war before the battle, Stevens advised \\"It is too late to retreat now; we must fight.\\" Stevens's statement is thought to have convinced Horatio Gates to engage the British rather than retreat.Russel, 169. The battle did not go well, and Stevens considered resigning, but Nathanael Greene convinced Stevens to continue his service.Rogers, 373-374. Stevens next commanded his militia at the Battle of Guilford Court House. Stevens' militia was positioned behind a line of North Carolina militia. When the North Carolinians broke, dropped their weapons, and ran at the beginning of the battle, Stevens told his soldiers to make way for the retreat and that this was part of the battle plan. Stevens also positioned riflemen behind his line to shoot retreating soldiers. During the battle Stevens was wounded in the thigh. Stevens was in Charlottesville, Virginia recovering from his wound when Banestre Tarleton launched a raid on the town to capture Virginia's legislature and its governor, Thomas Jefferson. Captain Jack Jouett, who had ridden through the night to warn of the British attack, drew the attention of the British and led them on a chase so the wounded Stevens could escape.Dabney.

He became the Authorized Person of Swaziland from 1982 to 1985 after the death of King Sobhuza II, and in 1983 was briefly the acting Regent of the country, after he deposed Queen Dzeliwe. From 1983 he was Authorized Person to the new Queen Regent, Ntombi, with greater powers. Although lacking the title, he was for most purposes the de facto ruler of the country. He fell from power in July 1984, after being accused of planning a coup, and was suspended as Authorized Person until Queen Ntombi terminated his appointment on 1 November 1985. Life Flag of Swaziland Prince Sozisa, who was already Senior Prince of the Swazi Nation, played a leading role in the negotiations which led to independence from the United Kingdom in 1968.Hilda Kuper, Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland: the story of an hereditary ruler and his country (Africana Publishing Co., 1978), pp. 274, 290, 306 For many years he was one of King Sobhuza II's closest advisers and a significant figure in the country.Colin Legum, Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents vol. 15 (1984), p. B-840 Following the death of King Sobhuza in August 1982, Prince Sozisa Dlamini held the powerful office of 'Authorised Person', the leading role among the Elders of the Nation, having been designated as such by the king before he died.Alan R. Booth, Swaziland: tradition and change in a southern African kingdom (1983): \\"Until he reached maturity, the country was to be ruled by the queen regent, Dzeliwe, and the sixteen-member liqoqo. Dzeliwe was in her mid-fifties, literate in English, and reputed to be strong- willed and intelligent. To assist her in council, Sobhuza before his death had designated an \\"authorized person,\\" Prince Sozisa, to act in her name\\".Gwyneth Williams, Brian Hackland, The dictionary of contemporary politics of southern Africa, p. 79 At the time, there was no certainty about who would inherit the throne, and Sobhuza's widow Queen Dzeliwe was chosen by a secret tribal process to assume the regency. At the same time Prince Sozisa was announced as the Queen's principal advisor, when The Times described him as \\"an elderly and hitherto obscure relative of the late king who bears the delightful title of the Authorized Person\\". A senior member of the Liqoqo, a supreme council of tribal elders, in practice Sozisa was believed to be in charge of the Swazi government, although nominally Mabandla Dlamini was Prime Minister.Michael Hornsby, Swaziland still mourns its King, in The Times Issue 61372 dated October 26, 1982, p. 6, col. B: \\"Prince Sozisa... an elderly and hitherto obscure relative of the late king who bears the delightful title of the Authorized Person\\". At the beginning of 1983, Sozisa was still the Queen's advisor, although reported to be \\"in poor health\\".Michael Hornsby, Swazis' chosen prince joins Great She Elephant, in The Times Issue 61421 dated January 2, 1983, p. 1, col. B On 20 March 1983, Sozisa chaired a press conference at the main royal kraal at Lobamba, supported by the cabinet ministers Polycarp Dlamini, Richard Dlamini, and Prince Gabneni, and announced that Mabandla Dlamini had been dismissed as Prime Minister. The next day, Mabandla went to his office as usual, claiming that the Queen had not yet informed him.Michael Hornsby, Swazi Premier ousted by She Elephant's advisers, in The Times Issue 61487 dated March 22, 1983, p. 8, col. A It was later uncertain that she had approved a change of prime minister, but a week later, Mabandla had been replaced by Bhekimpi Dlamini, another member of the royal house. The key to the change was thought to be that Bkekimpe was more receptive to a South African proposal to transfer to Swaziland most of the homeland of KaNgwane, an area of some with a notional population of 800,000, including a length of coast on the Indian Ocean.Michael Hornsby, Swaziland: white lies and black mischief in The Times, Issue 61494 dated March 30, 1983, p. 12, col. C In July 1983 there was an announcement of elections planned for October. At that time, the country was said to be under the control of the Liqoqo.Michael Hornsby, Swaziland election in October in The Times, Issue 61588 dated July 19, 1983, pg. 7, col. A On 9 August 1983, Queen Dzeliwe was dismissed as Regent and placed under house arrest. A notice of her dismissal, signed by Prince Sozisa, appeared in the Government Gazette the same day.Robert H. Davies, Dan O'Meara, Sipho Dlamini, The Kingdom of Swaziland: a profile (Zed Books, 1985), p. 58 Sozisa was briefly in charge, from 9 August until 18 August, while Ntombi was chosen as the new Queen Regent.Swaziland at worldstatesmen.org, accessed 20 January 2011 Her fourteen-year-old son Mswati emerged from the power struggle as Crown Prince, and in 1986 he was crowned King as Mswati III. One of Ntombi's first acts as regent was to give delegated powers to the Authorized Person, who was still Sozisa, to sign state documents making decisions on a number of matters of national importance.Richard Levin, When the sleeping grass awakens (Witwatersrand University Press, 1997), pp. 162-163 This change had been demanded by the 'Tibiyo' faction. Subsequently, the constitution was revised to provide that where the Regent and the Authorised Person were not in agreement on any matter, it must be referred to the princes and the chiefs. On 13 September 1983, Sozisa made a speech in which he condemned the Soviet Union,Daily report: Middle East & Africa: Index, vol. 4 (NewsBank, 1985), p. 315 and on 12 October three of his political opponents were charged with sedition.Daily report: Middle East & Africa: Index, vol. 4 (NewsBank, 1985), p. 625 Fall from power At the beginning of July 1984, the Swazi Observer reported that Sozisa, although chairman of the Liqoqo, was no longer attending its meetings. At about the same time, his police and military escorts ceased to guard him. Sozisa continued as the Authorized Person until the end of August 1984, when the Liqoqo suspended him, amid allegations that he had attempted a coup d'état in June.J. S. M. Matsebula, A history of Swaziland (Longman, 1988), p. 314 He was later reported to have gone into hiding in Siteki, under heavy guard. The official announcement of the termination of Sozisa's appointment as Authorized Person was not published until a year later.Balam Nyeko, Swaziland (Clio Press, 1994), p. 101: \\"Legal Notice 135 of 1985, terminating the appointment of Prince Sozisa as Authorized Person from 1 November 1985... issued by the Queen Regent\\". After this, he fell out of the news. He was reported to have died in 1992. Sozisa continued as Chief of Gundvwini until his death, when he was succeeded as acting Chief by his brother Prince Tfohlongwane Dlamini, who remained in the post until 2001, when he became chairman of the Swaziland National Council Standing Committee.Nana Poku, Security and development in Southern Africa (2001), p. 72 In that year, Prince Mangaliso Dlamini became Chief of Gundvwini.

The acronym stands for Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties and Time to call emergency services. *Facial drooping: A section of the face, usually only on one side, that is drooping and hard to move. This can be recognized by a crooked smile. *Arm weakness: The inability to raise one's arm fully, or the inability to hold something or squeeze i.e. someone's hand. *Speech difficulties: An inability or difficulty to understand or produce speech, slurred speech or having difficulty repeating even a basic sentence such as \\"The sky is blue\\". *Time: If any of the symptoms above are showing, time is of the essence; call the emergency services and go to the hospital immediately. It is also important to check the time for a dooby so that you'll know when the first symptoms appeared (time is brain) History The FAST acronym was developed in the UK in 1998 by a group of stroke physicians, ambulance personnel, and an emergency department physician and was designed to be an integral part of a training package for ambulance staff. The acronym was created to expedite administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator to patients within 3 hours of acute stroke symptom onset. The instruments at this time with most evidence of validity were the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) and the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS). Studies using FAST have demonstrated variable diagnostic accuracy of strokes by paramedics and emergency medical technicians with positive predictive values between 64% and 77%. Other acronyms such as BE-FAST has shown promise by capturing >95% of ischemic strokes, however adding coordination and JJ Redickdiplopia assessment did not improve stroke detection in the prehospital setting. Alternative versions BE-FAST has shown promise and is currently being studied as an alternative method to the FAST acronym. * Balance * Eyes * Face * Arm * Speech * Time NEWFAST (c) is an additional stroke identification tool available for use. Copyrighted by Deborah Stabell Tran in 2017, (and created in 2016) as part of a DNP project, it was created to identify all types of strokes - anterior or posterior ischemic, and hemorrhagic strokes. It gives more definition to testing dizziness and balance, hallmark signs of posterior strokes. NEWFAST also addresses the sudden onset of a severe headache and vomiting that often accompany bleeds in the head. NEW - means a NEW onset of symptoms (generally within the past 24 hours, but a sudden onset in general). *N - Nausea/Vomiting - sudden onset *E - Eyes - Double vision, field cut, neglect (can't see or notice what is going on, on one side of the body), and/or nystagmus(eyes involuntarily shifting back and forth) *W - Walking - If you suddenly can not walk due to dizziness, or your try to walk and you shift to one side. *F - Facial droop - one side of the face is droopy *A - Arm Weakness - especially one side being weak *S - Speech - slurred, confused, and/or absent speech *T - Terrible Headache/Dizziness (often described as thunderclap headache or dizziness regardless of position of body - sitting, standing, or laying down) Tran, D.S.

In 664 Gennadius rebelled against Emperor Constans II and was himself overthrown the next year by a loyalist uprising. Biography The Mediterranean world at the time of Gennadius =Background= In 646, the Exarch of Africa Gregory the Patrician launched a rebellion against Constans. The obvious reason was the latter's support for Monothelitism, but it was also a reaction to the Muslim conquest of Egypt, and the threat this presented to Byzantine Africa.Hollingsworth p. 875 Given the failure of the imperial government in Constantinople to stop the Muslim advance, it was, in the words of Charles Diehl, \\"a great temptation for the powerful governor of Africa to secede from the feeble and remote empire that seemed incapable of defending its subjects\\". Doctrinal differences, as well as the long-established autonomy of the African exarchate, reinforced this tendency.Diehl (1896), pp. 554–556 The Arab chronicler al-Tabari on the other hand claims that Gregory's revolt was provoked by a levy of 300 pounds of gold demanded by Constans.Winkelmann et al. pp. 49–50 In 647 the Arab Abdallah ibn Sa'ad invaded the Exarchate with 20,000 men. The Muslims moved through western Tripolitania and advanced up to the northern boundary of the Byzantine province of Byzacena. Gregory confronted the Arabs on their return at the Battle of Sufetula, but was defeated and killed.Diehl (1896), pp. 558–559Pringle (1981), p. 47 After the defeat of Gregory the Arab victors raided far and wide across the Exarchate while the Byzantines withdrew to their fortresses.Diehl (1896), pp. 559–560 =Exarch= Gennadius was a Byzantine general who served under the Emperor Constans II (). He assumed the position of Exarch of Africa after the death of Gregory. Although the emperor had not appointed him to the position, he managed to ensure the Arab withdrawal from Byzantine North Africa by promising them an annual tribute of 330,000 nomismata, over two tons of gold, and was confirmed in his position.. Like his predecessors, he acknowledged the authority of Constans, and transported to Constantinople the annual excess revenue raised from the province. He nevertheless administered Africa semi-autonomously, without interference from the imperial court, supported by the African bishops who were resolutely Chalcedonian, unlike the Emperor. The local population was disaffected. The Arab pillaging had caused them to lose faith in the ability of the Byzantines to defend them, while taxation increased sharply to pay the Arab tribute, the requirements of Constantinople and to rebuild the army. The Berber tribes in particular shook off their allegiance to the Empire, and most of southern Tunisia seems to have slipped outside the control of Carthage during Gennadius' tenure.Diehl (1896), pp. 560–561 This situation persisted until 663 when Constans moved the imperial court to Syracuse in Sicily, much closer to the Exarchate, and demanded an increase in tribute. In 664 Gennadius refused to send to Constans the additional revenue and expelled the emperor’s representative.. This caused an uprising in Africa, where the garrison troops joined with the local citizens, led by Eleutherios the Younger, to expel Gennadius in 665. Eleutherios installed himself as the new exarch and was in time confirmed by Constans.. Gennadius fled to the court of Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), 1st caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate at Damascus, where he asked him for aid in recapturing Carthage. The Caliph agreed and sent a large force with Gennadius to invade Byzantine Africa in 665. However, Gennadius died when he reached Alexandria in late 665..

The vest is standard issue for many members of the United States special operations forces including the 75th Ranger Regiment. 10,000 vests were deployed on an interim basis with the U.S. Marine Corps while it developed the Scalable Plate Carrier. The vest was also evaluated by the U.S. Army.  Design  The vest has removable Small Arms Protective Insert plates. The MBAV does not offer as much coverage as the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV). The vest weighs , averaging about lighter than the IOTV. Lighter armor, which offers greater mobility, has become a priority due to the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. It is only meant to protect the vital areas with armored plates, instead covering non-vital areas with soft armor.  History  The vest has been standard issue for many members of the American SOF operators including the 75th Ranger Regiment. Those 10,000 vests were deployed on an interim basis with the U.S. Marine Corps while it developed the Scalable Plate Carrier. 500 vests were intended to be evaluated by the U.S. Army for two months beginning in April 2009 in Afghanistan. Army acquisition officials delayed the assessment to complete additional safety testing. Three-dozen airborne troops took part in Soldier Protection Demonstration VII at Yuma Proving Ground in May 2009. The soldiers analyzed eight plate carrier vests including the MBAV. A different plate carrier was selected for procurement.

Background The future Consort Chen was born in 577, during the reign of her father Emperor Xuan as Princess Ningyuan of Chen. Princess Ningyuan's mother was Emperor Xuan's concubine Consort Shi () (551 - 609). A native of Chang'an, Consort Shi was the daughter of Shi Jifeng (), Prince of Shixing (). In addition to Princess Ningyuan, she had borne Emperor Xuan two sons: Shu'ao, Prince of Linhe and Chen Shuxing, Prince of Ruanling. Both sons later became officials under the Sui Dynasty.https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%A3%E5%8D%8E%E5%A4%AB%E4%BA%BA/296664?fr=aladdin The year Princess Ningyuan was born, Northern Qi, at whose expense Emperor Xuan had expanded Chen, fell to Northern Zhou. Cornered, Chen lost many of the gains that it had made from its conquest of Northern Qi territory. In 582, when Princess Ningyuan was five, Emperor Xuan died, and the throne was inherited by Princess Ningyuan's older half-brother Chen Shubao, who was an incompetent ruler. On 10 February 589, Chen Shubao surrendered to Emperor Wen of Sui, ending the Chen Dynasty. Chen Shubao and his household (which presumably included Princess Ningyuan) were then escorted to the Sui capital. As Imperial Consort After the fall of the Chen Dynasty, Princess Ningyuan was honored as Lady Xuanhua (). She became a consort of Emperor Wen, but he never had relations with her when Empress Dugu was alive. After Empress Dugu's death, Emperor Wen favored Consort Chen and another concubine, Consort Cai. In 604, Emperor Wen resided at Renshou Palace at the advice of his officials. He was accompanied by Consort Chen and Consort Cai, and his son Yang Guang. Emperor Wen was sick and frail, and Yang Guang seized the opportunity to rape Consort Chen. Consort Chen reported the incident to Emperor Wen, who was angered and sought to replace Yang Guang as the crown prince with Yang Yong. Yang Guang found out and decided to kill Emperor Wen with the assistance of an official named Yang Su. After Emperor Wen's death, Yang Guang took Consort Chen as one of his concubines, along with Consort Cai.

His murals depict historical scenes from Mexican history with an emphasis on revolutionary subjects. His work is featured in public and government buildings across Mexico. He has also painted murals in the USA and Europe. He lives in Xalapa, Veracruz. Early years Oscar Melchor Peredo y Garcia was born January 6, 1927 in Mexico City. His father Luis G. Peredo was a journalist during the 1910 Mexican revolution and became a pioneer of Mexican cinema. In 1918 Luis G. Peredo directed the popular silent film \\"Santa\\" based on the 1903 naturalist novel by Federico Gamboa. At the age of eleven, Inspired by the work of muralists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, Melchor decided to become a painter. He studied at several major art institutes in Mexico City including the Escuela La Esmeralda and the National School of Arts. He painted his first mural in 1947 in a maternity clinic, depicting the exploitation of marginalized workers in Mexico City. In 1953, he joined the Frente Nacional de Artes Plásticas and was commissioned as a representative to assist at the IV World Youth Festival for Peace in Romania. The art critic Judith Krauss made arrangements for him to stay in Bucharest but he decided that the most important movement was in Mexico and returned home to join a research workshop funded by the National Polytechnic Institute. There he perfected his fresco technique under the guidance of José Gutierrez, a proponent of the first artistic use of acrylic paint.

He built two of Sydney's grandest houses, Cranbrook House and The Swifts. Early life Robert was the first son of Robert Tooth (b.1799) and Mary Ann (née Reader), a hops merchant of Swifts Park, Cranbrook, Kent, England. His brothers were Edwin (1822–1858), and Frederick (1827–1893). His uncle was John Tooth (b. 1803), Cranbrook merchant and brewer, who first migrated to Sydney in the Bencoolen in 1828 and received a 2560-acre (1036 ha) grant in Durham County, New South Wales. After John established himself as a successful merchant he opened the Kent Brewery on Parramatta Road. In August 1843 Robert and Edwin arrived in Sydney on the Euphrates. The enduring merchant and brewing firm of R. and E. Tooth began on 1 September 1843 when John leased them the brewery. Business and Public life Frederick joined Sydney and the partnership about 1853 and R., E. and F. Tooth became R. and F. Tooth & Co. on 2 January 1860 when J. S. Mitchell became a partner. In 1852 with John Edye, James Alexander and (Sir) William Montagu Manning, Mort, J. Croft and Edwin, Robert formed the Twofold Bay Pastoral Association which acquired some 400,000 acres (161,876 ha) on the south coast and Monaro; Kameruka was the head station. Threatened by (Sir) John Robertson's land bills they bought as much land as possible in their own names and disbanded in 1860. For 10 months from May 1856 he was an appointed member of the Legislative Council. A large squatter with about 600 employees, at the January 1858 election he stood for seat of Sydney Hamlets in the Legislative Assembly, advocating free selection of land at £1 an acre without auction, tramways instead of expensive railways to bring produce to market and an elective Upper House. He lost, but won a seat representing Sydney City two days later. Questionably claiming to have disposed of all his runs except one on the Queensland border and opposing Robertson's land bill, Robert stood for West Sydney in December 1860 but again was defeated. Tooth then concentrated on his business interests. Their London house, R. & F. Tooth & Mort, 155 Fenchurch Street, acted also as agents for Smyth's Sydney Marine Assurance Office and the Peak Downs Copper Mining Co. He became a committee-man of the Society for the Suppression of Cattle Stealing in 1861 and of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales. He was a partner of Robert Cran, F. F. Nixon, (Sir) Robert Lucas Tooth and Frederick under the style of Tooth and Cran until March 1872 at Yengarie near Maryborough, Queensland, and in the Wide Bay and Burnett districts. From 1865 they experimented with meat preserving at Yengarie and in 1870 won a prize at the Intercolonial Exhibition, Sydney. In the mid-1860s Robert still nominally held the Lachlan and Wide Bay runs he had leased in the 1850s; he had added Jondaryan and Irvingdale, almost 300 sq. miles (777 km²) on the Darling Downs and some twenty-eight runs, amounting to 700 sq. miles (1813 km²), in the Maranoa District of Queensland. Tooth was also a director of the Bank of New South Wales in the 1850s and 1860s (president in 1862-63) and a director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. in 1855–63; A prominent Anglican layman, he was a director of the Society for the Relief of Destitute Children, a fellow of St Paul's College within the University of Sydney and an original committee-man of the Union Club. He began building his fine residence, Cranbrook, at Rose Bay in 1859 but sold it to Robert Towns in 1864. Robert retired from R. and F. Tooth & Co. in April 1872 and Frederick and R. L. Tooth carried on as F. Tooth & Co. This partnership was dissolved on 31 March 1873 when Frederick retired, Mitchell and R. L. Tooth carrying on as Tooth & Co. Most of the profit from this successful business came from importing wines, spirits and beer, as colonial beer was not widely drunk until the 1880s. On 1 May 1849 he had married at St Mark's Church, Pontville, Van Diemen's Land, Maria Lisle, daughter of Captain G. B. Forster, R.N.; on 24 June 1871 he married Elizabeth Mansfield.

It was one of the first electric guitar quartets and was billed as a band from post-apocalypse Canada \\"inspired by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix\\". Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar performed for four years in Canada, the United States and Europe. They released two albums, in 1987 and 1989. Biography In the mid-1980s, experimental rock guitarist and composer André Duchesne from Montreal, Quebec, Canada began writing contrapuntal compositions for a guitar quartet. To perform them he recruited René Lussier and Jean-Pierre Bouchard from Conventum, Duchesne's late-1970s avant-garde folk-rock group, and Roger Boudreault, a jazz guitarist. The quartet premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986 with ex-Henry Cow drummer Chris Cutler. Duchesne wanted drums to complete the group's sound and asked Cutler, who was already playing at the festival with Cassiber, to perform with the quartet. Also present at the festival was ex-Henry Cow guitarist and composer Fred Frith, who was playing in a duo with Lussier. Frith was impressed with Duchesne's guitar quartet and later wrote an extended composition, \\"The As Usual Dance Towards the Other Flight to What Is Not\\" for them to play. In 1989 Frith formed his own guitar quartet, the Fred Frith Guitar Quartet. Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar was a concept band with an history constructed by Duchesne. From the future, and \\"inspired by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix\\", they were the resident band at the Apocalypso-Bar in a wrecked jetliner in post-apocalypse Canada. Being a bar band they wore white suits and tiger ties, and played sitting down, with the soloists standing. The \\"band from the future\\" concept extended to the titles of their albums. In 1987, they released a studio album they called Tournée Mondiale/Été '89 (World Tour/Summer '89), followed in 1989 by Fin de Siècle (End of Century). In 1995 a compilation album entitled World Tour 1998 was released by Cutler's Recommended Records featuring most of the tracks from their first two albums. François Couture at AllMusic described their music as \\"a cross between [guitarists] Robert Fripp's circular motifs and Fred Frith's angular playing.\\" They toured Canada, the United States and Europe, maintaining their \\"bar band\\" image throughout. In early 1989, jazz guitarist Claude Fradette replaced Boudreault, bassist Ferdinand Richard from Etron Fou Leloublan joined, and Rémi Leclerc from Miriodor played drums when Cutler was engaged elsewhere. By the end of 1989, having exhausted the band's concept, they decided to split up.

The act also mandates that the government of Bhutan provide counselling and treatment to facilitate tobacco cessation. Premised on the physical health and well being of the Bhutanese people – important elements of Gross National Happiness – the Tobacco Control Act recognizes the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke on both spiritual and social health.TCA: Preamble Long before the enactment of the Tobacco Control Act, Bhutan's government had struggled against tobacco use. In 1916, the first King of Bhutan Ugyen Wangchuck promulgated a ban on the \\"most filthy and noxious herb, called tobacco.\\" The modern Tobacco Control Act, however, led to controversy because of its harsh penalties. In January 2012, Parliament passed urgent amendments with the effect of greatly increasing permissible amounts of tobacco and reducing penalties, although sale and distribution remain prohibited. No-smoking laws The consumption of tobacco is not altogether prohibited in Bhutan, though it is largely banned in places of public accommodation. The act largely targets smoking in particular, though any form of tobacco is subject to the act. The Tobacco Control Act establishes non- smoking areas: commercial centers including markets, hotel lobbies, restaurants, and bars; recreation centers such as discothèques, cinemas, and playing fields; institutions and offices, both public and private; public gatherings and public spaces such as festivals, taxi stands, and the airport; all public transportation; and any other places declared by the Tobacco Control Board.TCA: § 3 The board also has the authority to designate smoking areas in public.TCA: § 26(b) Smoking areas are permitted in non-public areas of hotels (i.e., smoking floors or smoking rooms) at the discretion of the patron.TCA: § 9 The act imposes a duty on persons in charge of these areas of public accommodation to display signs prohibiting smoking, demand smokers cease, report offenders who refuse to the police, and comply with inspections.TCA: §§ 4–8 Trade and commerce of tobacco products The act prohibits the cultivation, harvest, manufacture, supply, and distribution of tobacco, as well as the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, and purchase of tobacco products within Bhutan.TCA: § 11 The act allows individuals to import tobacco and tobacco products for personal consumption according to limits set by the Tobacco Control Board subject to duties and taxes. Those who bring their own tobacco or tobacco products into Bhutan must bear proof of taxation, may only bring goods that display required health warnings, and must not bring goods that promote tobacco by means that are false, misleading, or likely to create an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health effects, or hazardsTCA: §§ 12–17 (cf. descriptors such as \\"light\\" or \\"mild\\"). The act thoroughly prohibits tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, restricting the appearance of tobacco in domestic videos and movies to educational clips produced for the purpose of health promotion.TCA: §§ 18–19 The act's chapter on \\"Educational Measures\\" authorizes the government of Bhutan to form agencies in order to promote health awareness, prevent smoking in non-smokers, and strategize tobacco control. In conjunction, the act also authorizes programs for government research and surveillance of tobacco use.TCA: §§ 20–21 Enforcement agencies The Tobacco Control Act establishes two new government institutions to regulate tobacco use in Bhutan: the Tobacco Control Board and the Tobacco Control Office. The members of both the Board and the Office serve concurrently in government anti-narcotics offices. The Tobacco Control Board is the same body as the preexisting Bhutan Narcotic Control Board, now charged with regulating tobacco and enforcing that regulation under the act. The board provides guidance and direction to the Tobacco Control Office and other law enforcement agencies regarding tobacco law enforcement and is permitted to propose amendments to parliament on the Tobacco Control Act itself.TCA: §§ 24–27 Any amendments to the act must be approved by a simple majority in both the National Council and National Assembly, or by at least two-thirds of a quorum of parliament, and the amendments must not undermine the Bhutan Narcotic Control Agency.TCA: § 59 The act mandates the Tobacco Control Board, through the Tobacco Control Office, to provide cessation programs in health facilities and to work with rehabilitation centers in diagnosing and counseling tobacco dependence. To this end, the act authorizes the government to facilitate affordable access to treatment, including pharmaceutical products.TCA: §§ 22–23 The act further provides a procedural framework for the functioning of the board. TCA: § 28 The Tobacco Control Office is occupied by the Bhutan Narcotic Control Agency and headed by its executive director. The office acts as the agent of the board responsible for coordinating most of the actual implementation of Bhutan's tobacco policy.TCA: §§ 29–32 The act tasks other government institutions and agencies with implementing its terms and the rules promulgated by the Tobacco Control Board. The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs are all responsible for implementing the laws in the act and the policies of the board in specified arenas.TCA: §§ 33–37, 42 Ancillary government institutions, such as the Royal Bhutan Police, the Civil Society Organization, and the Road Safety and Transport Authority are also authorized with enforcement and coordinating awareness on tobacco control.TCA: §§ 38, 40–42 Likewise, local-level Thromdes (municipal governments) are also to coordinate and conduct awareness programs on tobacco control.TCA: § 39 Enforcement laws The act also provides a substantive and procedural framework for enforcement by authorized officers of the above government bodies.TCA: §§ 42–46 If officers believe there is tobacco within, they are authorized to enter and inspect public and business places, and any place pursuant to a search warrant, at any reasonable time. They are also authorized to stop and inspect vehicles on the road and examine containers at checkpoints if they believe tobacco is inside. Officers may also demand proof of tax and duty payment at any reasonable time. According to regulations established by the board, officers are also empowered to confiscate and destroy contraband.TCA: § 43 The powers of confiscation, search and seizure are subject to the provisions of the Penal Code and the Civil and Criminal Codes.TCA: §§ 44–45 The act lists eight new offenses and corresponding penalties, ranging from fines for smoking in non-smoking areas to fourth- degree (lowest degree) felony charges for smuggling. Fourth-degree felonies are punishable by imprisonment for three to five years. Anyone in possession of more tobacco than the import limit is guilty (strictly liable) of smuggling. Those caught selling tobacco in Bhutan receive reduced sentences if their crime is mitigated by disclosing the tobacco's source to authorities.TCA: §§ 47–54 In addition, depictions of tobacco use in motion media other than for health promotion constitute a petty misdemeanor; as such, the act also provides for a content-based restriction on speech.TCA: §§ 47–54 Enforcement practices and controversy In practice, enforcement resulted in some high-profile cases, however at least one citizen has complained publicly that enforcement is spotty and arbitrary. Another has come forth to highlight the disparate treatment among classes and of tobacco among other addictive habits widespread in Bhutan such as ara, doma, ema datshi and phak sha sikam, and to decry that tobacco possession in Bhutan could be punished with the same sentence as for rape of the elderly. In the first major prosecution under the act, a 23-year-old ordained monk named Sonam Tshering from Langpa in Haa was caught on January 24, 2011, with 480 grams of chewing tobacco (purchased for Nu.120) en route from Phuentsholing to Thimphu. This was the first such prosecution under the Tobacco Control Act. A private individual informed the police that Tshering possessed tobacco. Under current customs schedules, a tax of 100 per cent was levied on tobacco from India, and 200 per cent on tobacco from all other countries of origin, with a maximum of 150 grams of tobacco per month. Although Tshering revealed the source of his tobacco, to mitigate and qualify his offence as a misdemeanor, he failed to identify the location and supplier of the tobacco, apparently somewhere in the border town of Jaigaon. He was thus convicted of a felony, whose minimum sentence is three years. Although the Constitution of Bhutan guarantees all persons the right to be represented by a jabmi (attorney), the Thimphu District Court closed the case before any jabmi offered his services. The court convicted Tshering of smuggling and sentenced him for smuggling under the Tobacco Control Act. In the ensuing controversy, the Prime Minister of Bhutan Lyonpo Jigme Thinley issued statements that Tshering's case had been \\"blown out of proportion,\\" while sympathizing with those who felt the severity of the sentence was incongruent to the offense committed. The prime minister pointed out that the legislation was a product of Bhutan's modern bicameral parliamentary and democratic process, having been debated in both the National Assembly and National Council, and assented by the Royal Government. With the truism that no law is perfect, he invited the public to amend the Tobacco Control Act peacefully under the new Bhutanese democratic process. Sonam Tshering has since appealed the District Court ruling to the High Court of Bhutan, for which he has retained a private attorney. The Bhutan Observer editor has questioned the constitutionality of the Tobacco Control Act and its enforcement in view of the harshness of the sentence. In early March 2011, a high-profile incident at Paro Airport resulted in the arrests of a Royal Bhutan Army constable, officer and aircraft engineer allegedly involved in importing a carton of 555 cigarettes without paying tax at the Paro Airport. Constable Tshering Jamtsho and Captain Sonam Tshewang were officially handed over to police by the Royal Bhutan Army, while police arrested aircraft engineer Chogyal Gyeltshen separately. Customs agents had caught Constable Jamtsho with some 200 cigarettes. Jamtsho alleged they were purchased by the aircraft engineer for a Major Karma Dorji. The Bhutanese Customs authorities investigated the affair for 51 hours before issuing arrest warrants; the further investigation was begun by the Royal Bhutan Police, however the police expressed their refusal to investigate the matter until it was referred to them, despite the legal requirement that matters be brought to the attention of the police within 24 hours. Because the arrests were not immediate, the affair is somewhat controversial. Less than two days later, on March 7, 2011, another tip-off at Paro Airport resulted in the arrest of two female keepers of different shops in possession of about 200 cigarettes (nineteen packets) and eleven packets of chewing tobacco (\\"baba\\") in total. Upon arrest and interrogation of the first shopkeeper, police learned her source was the second; the second disclosed her source to police. On that information, police arrested a 39-year-old bus driver at the Chunzom checkpost. Throughout 2011, there were several more tobacco-related arrests at Chunzom, including that of an 81-year-old man. In late March 2011, another arrest in Phuentsholing, a major border town, allegedly produced a network of apparently unwitting transporters of tobacco products worth Nu.45,000 in a consignment passing through Jaigaon. The activities were traced to a businesswoman based in Thimphu. The controversy over the tobacco laws and the reach of government touched even the Bhutanese media. In late March 2011, the Royal Bhutan Police sued a 28-year-old former employee of the Bhutan Media Service in Thimphu for spreading rumours that police had raided one of the media houses earlier in March 2011 on a tobacco-related pretext. The rumour was characterized as a joke and a hoax. According to police, the accused had confessed to spreading unfounded rumours that the police had visited Bhutan Media Services offices warning them not to smoke, and that employees would be arrested if caught. This provoked public outrage, prompting outcries in news opinion columns. Police, through Kuensel, stated that \\"police was referred to as blue dogs encroaching into private space and waiting for crime to happen. We were blamed for no reason and encroaching is a strong word.\\" The incident resulted in the termination of the employee. Although some Bhutanese have decried the Tobacco Control Act as draconian, the subject has remained open to debate. Members of Parliament report variously that they have received no input or that their constituents hold a favorable opinion of the law. Most vigorous debate continues in urban areas. The Bhutanese public seems convinced, however, that threats to health and happiness from tobacco pale in comparison to those posed by alcohol and drugs. Members of local and national governments have generally supported the Tobacco Control Act as it was enacted and opposed any amendments, especially before the expiration of a mandatory one-year waiting period. Amendment On 4 September 2011, Prime Minister Jigme Thinley stated at a press conference that his government would act swiftly to enact an amendment to the Tobacco Control Act. The prime minister explained the decision was based on the \\"pain and the suffering\\" the act had caused after some 59 arrests, adding that his government would consult with the National Council to ensure its presentation during the next legislative session. In reaction, semi-nomadic communities in Merak and Sakteng along the porous Indian border near Arunachal Pradesh expressed vocal support for the status quo, or even strengthening its provisions, due to the negative impacts of the illicit tobacco trade among their populations. In January 2012, Health Minister Lyonpo Zangley Drukpa brought the amendment to debate in the National Assembly. Considered urgent legislation, the bill was taken up by a joint committee of National Assembly and National Council MPs, and passed with nearly unanimous support. As proposed by the National Council, the amendment would have lifted the ban on tobacco sale and distribution within Bhutan, though production would have remained prohibited. At its passage, however, the amendment retained the prohibition on sale and distribution. Under the amendment, possession limits were increased, and penalties were decreased. The permissible quantity of individual cigarettes was changed from 200 to 300; individual beedis from 200 to 400; individual cigars from thirty to fifty; and other tobacco products raised from . Penalties were also regraded, with possession of less than three times the limit defined as a petty misdemeanor; possession of over three but under four times the limit a misdemeanor; and fourth degree felony reserved for possession of four times the limit.

Born in Ferntown near Collingwood in the Nelson district of New Zealand to William and Jane Crook, she migrated to Australia in 1929, eventually moving to Townsville in northern Queensland, where she died at the age of 68. She is best known for the novels Sugar Heaven and The Butcher Shop, but she also wrote short stories and political papers.  Literary connections  Devanny was one of the founders of the Writers' League with Katharine Susannah Prichard and Egon Kisch. In 1935 she became the League's first president. The Writers' League became the Writer's Association in 1937.Ron Store, 'Devanny, Jane (Jean) (1894–1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition, Copyright 2006, updated continuously, ISSN 1833-7538, published by Australian National University http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080316b.htm She was a close friend and correspondent of Miles Franklin, Marjorie Barnard and Winifred Hamilton, and was in frequent contact with other Australian writers throughout the mid-20th Century.Ferrier, C. (1992). As good as a yarn with you : letters between Miles Franklin, Katharine Susannah Prichard, Jean Devanny, Marjorie Barnard, Flora Eldershaw and Eleanor Dark. Oakleigh, Vic.: Cambridge University Press. In 1948, she approached Mary Gilmore to write a foreword to Travels in North Queensland, but Gilmore declined on the basis that Devanny should write it herself, as 'I have written so many that I have decided not to write any more for a time, as they will have no value by now'.Ferrier, C. (1999). Jean Devanny : romantic revolutionary. Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press  Political activity  Jean Devanny c.1931 Devanny joined the Communist Party of Australia in the early 1920s, and had a long-term affair with the general secretary Jack Miles; called \\"Leader\\" in her memoirs. However, many in the party disagreed with her \\"forthright avant-garde views\\" and her candid discussion of sexual activities and women's sexuality. The style of writing of Sugar Heaven was called \\"reportage\\" or \\"fact in the form of fiction\\" by Egon Kisch. However, the party bureaucracy's treatment of her novel Cindie (about the North Queensland sugar industry) finally provoked her resignation in 1950. She had had several disagreements with the leadership of the party that led to her expulsion in 1940. She rejoined the party in 1944, but left permanently in 1950. Despite the egalitarian ideals espoused by the ideology of Communism, the party leadership was dominated by men, who often stayed true to the idea that women's participation in politics was best left to a supporting role.Personal Correspondence, Jean Devanny Archive, James Cook University Library Special Collections. Although she remained a staunch Communist for years after leaving the party, she often expressed disagreement and dissatisfaction with many other communists of the time – most notably Picasso, of whom she reportedly said: 'Picasso hasn't got any political opinions. His work proves that. He's only got a sentimental attachment to the idea of social justice'. Devanny was known to use her novels as a way of expressing ideological concepts and principles. During the 1930s, she toured North Queensland to spread propaganda for the Communist movement. Sugar Heaven was written during this period, drawing upon her experiences working as a domestic servant on a sugar and was intended to be a form of propaganda. Despite decreasing her political activity in her later years, she did continue to express her opinions on local, national and global political events and figures.  Later years  Devanny later regretted viewing her novels as a way to convey ideology, rather than trying to write to the best of her abilities. She later noted: 'I realise now that I have not exploited the small measure of ability for writing I possess one whit. I never really got down to it and THOUGHT. Thought was reserved for politics'. Devanny moved to North Queensland during the 1940s and spent the last two decades of her life in the region, expanding her knowledge of the natural world, taking part in multiple anthropological trips along the cost of North Queensland. During the 1950s, she wrote many articles and stories, which documented many details about the region during the mid Twentieth Century, focusing on a range of themes, such as the relations between White Australians and Indigenous. She died on 8 March 1962 in Townsville, having been diagnosed with chronic leukaemia. Her remains were cremated in Rockhampton. Her daughter Pat also became a communist activist.  Records and collections  The Eddie Koiki Mabo Library at James Cook University, Townsville, holds copies of all of Devanny's published works in the North Queensland Collection. Many of Devanny's private papers, consisting of drafts of speeches, published and unpublished articles, personal communications and letters, are held in the Library's Special Collections.JCU Library Archives: Jean Devanny Retrieved 20 January 2011, from http://libserver.jcu.edu.au/specials/Archives/devanny.html  Bibliography  = Novels = * The Butcher Shop (1926) * Lenore Divine (1926) * Dawn Beloved (1928) * Riven (1929) * Devil Made saint (1930) * Bushman Burke (1930) (aka Taipo) * Poor Swine (1932) * Out of Such Fires (1934) * The Virtuous Courtesan (1935) * The Ghost Wife (1935) * Sugar Heaven (1936) * Paradise Flow (1938) * The Killing of Jacqueline Love (1942) * Roll Back the Night (1945) * Cindie : A Chronicle of the Canefields (1949) = Short story collection = * Old Savage : And Other Stories (1927) = Non-fiction = * By Tropic Sea and Jungle : Adventures in North Queensland (1944) - travel * Bird of Paradise (1945) - biography * Travels in North Queensland (1951) - travel * Point of Departure: The Autobiography of Jean Devanny (1987) - autobiography  External links  *Jean Devanny by Carole Ferrier (2007 essay) *Jean Devanny at the \\"Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\\" *Jean Devanny at the \\"Australian Dictionary of Biography\\" *A 1926 review of The Butcher Shop *Joan Stevens on The Butcher Shop (1962) References Category:1894 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Australian women novelists Category:New Zealand communists Category:New Zealand women novelists Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia Category:20th-century New Zealand novelists Category:20th-century Australian novelists Category:Communist women writers Category:People from Collingwood, New Zealand Category:20th-century New Zealand women writers Category:20th-century Australian women writers Category:People from Townsville Category:Communist Party of Australia members ","title":"Jean Devanny"},{"id":"30541581","text":"André Duchesne (born 1949) is a Canadian experimental music guitarist and composer. He was a co-founder of Ambiances Magnétiques, a Canadian musical collective and record label, and formed several experimental music bands, including Conventum, Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar and Locomotive. Duchesne has also released five solo albums. Biography André Duchesne was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1949. As a teenager he learnt acoustic guitar, but was not satisfied with the popular rock music being played at the time. In the mid-1970s he formed an avant-garde folk-rock group called Conventum with René Lussier, Jean Derome, Jean-Pierre Bouchard, Jacques Laurin, Bernard Cormier and poet Alain-Arthur Painchaud. Conventum was described by AllMusic as a mixture of \\"Quebec's folk roots with absurd poetry and progressive arrangements\\". They released two albums, À l'Affût d'un Complot in 1977 and Le Bureau Central des Utopies in 1979. In 1983 Duchesne, Lussier, Derome and Robert M. Lepage formed Ambiances Magnétiques, a musical collective and artist-run record label specialising in avant-garde music. Duchesne released his first solo album, Le Temps des Bombes on the new label in 1984. Then he began writing contrapuntal compositions for a guitar quartet, and formed Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar (The 4 Guitarists of the Apocalypso-Bar) with Lussier, Bouchard and Roger Boudreault to perform the pieces. Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar was a concept band that Duchesne said was from post-apocalypse Canada \\"inspired by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix\\". They premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville (FIMAV) at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986, and continued until 1989, touring Canada, the United States and Europe. They also released two albums in 1987 and 1989. After the success of Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar, Duchesne returned to FIMAV in 1989 to premier \\"his most ambitious work ever\\", L' Ou 'L, a composition that explored different styles of chamber music. In 1991, he formed Locomotive with Claude Fradette and Rémi Leclerc, which also performed at FIMAV in 1991. Locomotive recorded an album of the same name in 1992, which AllMusic called \\"the pinnacle of André Duchesne's discography\\". During the mid- to late-1990s, Duchesne formed several rock bands, but they never recorded. In 1999 he released Réflexions, an album of classical guitar solos, and in 2001, Polaroïde, a free improvisation session for guitar, viola and percussion. Duchesne returned to FIMAV for its 21st edition in 2004 to premier Cordes à danser, a new project of his featuring a string quartet and a \\"power trio\\" of guitar, bass and drums.

RRUFC currently run two senior teams, the 1XV and the Mariners. The Mariners ply their trade in the Tees Valley Social League.  History  The first mention of the club is to be found in a letter to the Evening Gazette dated 23 November 1920 when Mr H.L.De Roper, who was staying at the Coatham Hotel, wrote to the editor suggesting that it was time that the town of Redcar had its own rugby club. \\"I am only a temporary resident at Redcar, so cannot take the initiative myself, but I am sure a XV could be raised in the town if someone would take the matter in hand. Perhaps, sir, you would help by publishing this letter, and a meeting of anyone interested could be arranged, but as I am leaving the town this week for some time I cannot take the lead myself.\\" On 19 November 1921 Redcar played West Hartlepool who had beaten Middlesbrough the previous week by 26-8. The Redcar team was full back Johnson three quarters Ridley, Stephenson, Thomas, groves, halves, Macalden, T Callum captain, forwards Edwards, G.Callum, Tomlinson, Irwin, Stevenson, Anderton, Robson and Fletcher. It is a shame to record that the Redcar side lost by 9pts to 3 despite excellent defence throughout. On 3 December later that year whilst playing against South Bank at the racecourse it was noted that after scoring their opening try Redcar had 16 players on the field and one was asked to leave. Was this the first example of gamesmanship? There were no subs in those days either so where did he come from? Redcar won the game by 18pts to 9. The name of Mackinlay has been known in rugby circles for many years. Dr. J.E.H. Mackinlay took over The Green House from Colonel Locke in about 1876 and although he did not play rugby in the north, he played three quarter for St George's hospital and the united London hospitals. He went on to play for England as a forward in 1872,73 and 75 and appears on a photo of the England team dated 3 March 1873. Dr W.H.Mackinlay (after whom Mackinlay park was named) who, because he attended Coatham grammar school never actually played rugby was extremely keen and in 1920 took the first opportunity of helping promote the Redcar rugby club, as we now know it. He became the first president, and J.Lambert (Pinkie) Spence the first chairman. Like many of the original rugby administrators in this area Pinkie was a Tynesider, and as the Callum's were both at school at Sedbergh their plain chocolate was adopted as the original club colours. Dr Mackinlay continued as a most regular supporter throughout the 1920s and 1930s and gained great pleasure from two sources. Coatham School changing to rugby and the extremely good side of the late 1930s. He died just after the start of the Second World War and the club closed down for the war years. The dynasty continued however with Dr Ian Mackinlay who played his first game for the club at Easter 1923 on his return from Durham school. He along with Norman Knudsen (as captain and secretary), Charlie Powell (as rest of the committee) started things up again after the war. Their fund raising activities were based almost exclusively upon the clients of the Royal Standard Hotel. The following year Ken Forster and most of the old crowd returned and the club re constituted. Ian Mackinlay was president and Ken Forster as chairman, a post he was to hold for over 20 years before leaving the area on business. The next member of the family to become involved was Nick Mackinlay who was captain of the 1st XV in 1973/74/75. . Nick, probably the best scrum half the club has ever seen and a Yorkshire trialist, was a regular member of the side for many years during the late 1960s and 1970s before moving on to play an important part in the rapid promotion of Stirling County, finishing his playing career at Ilkley. The club on its restart in 1947 had little funds and few players. John Pargeter recalls attending a meeting in the Royal Standard Hotel with the president Dr Ian in the chair; Ken Forster; Norman Knudsen who had been the 1939 skipper; Charlie Powell (who had his hands on the little brass that existed at the time) and a handful of stragglers who had returned from the services. The ground at the racecourse was still there with its ups and downs, and the little stand, which never had a roof, was also still there. So was the stable where the players changed. Prior to the war it had been the practice that the players were allowed to change in the jockeys weighing room. The club was evicted from that accommodation because the scales used to weigh the 7 stone jockeys were unsurprisingly damaged by the 16 stone rugby forwards checking on the weight of this week's pack. The new accommodation consisted of two loose boxes the floors being covered in straw. A bath of sorts was constructed and filled from the copper boiler. Once everyone was changed, the ladies would provide tea amongst the now somewhat soggy straw, on trestle tables. The committee were approached by Bill Stainsby who had a small engineering business at South Bank. He offered for sale two former R.A.F. wooden huts and would erect them on the racecourse. Permission was granted and the new home arrived. Doug Smailes a talented young bricklayer was given the job of building a fireplace which when completed became the focal point of the clubhouse. A brewery was approached and it was decided to take a loan from Sam Smiths, who can ever forget Taddy's Ales! In gratitude to the racecourse it was agreed that as the new clubhouse would only be used during the winter, beds would be brought in during the summer for the stable boys and jockeys. Never ones to miss a trick and with due democracy the players wives were volunteered to run the hostel with all moneys going into the rugby club's funds. The new ground was to be at Green Lane on farmland owned by Lord Zetland, the contacts that we had made through Dr. Ian Mackinlay and others gave us this opportunity to grow. Willie Wardman farmed the land, Willie remained a member and good friend to many at the club until his death. In 1959 the land was bought and prepared, in 1961 the first games were played at green lane however for the next two years the old club continued to be used for both changing and the entertainment of our guests. Finally in 1963 we moved into the new clubhouse celebrated with a game against a Durham Presidents XV and the ground was formally named Mackinlay Park. The club itself consisted of the main bar area, the small lounge and two changing rooms and a single bath. The playing field area was the portion of the field to the north of the old ditch line where two pitches could be accommodated. This was luxury. Much of the money needed to fund this move was obtained from our brewers Samuel Smiths. They were always very fair in their dealings with us but their product wasn't universally popular and we then moved onto Scottish and Newcastle. Some ten years later a small nucleus of players decided that it was time that squash courts were built. After much heart searching it was decided to build two courts and to extend the changing rooms. The project was completed and to celebrate the official opening of this facility Jonah Barrington was invited to open the courts. He was unable to attend and so on Sunday 22 September 1974 at 2.15pm the courts were opened by Mr. John Pargeter. Following the ceremony a rugby match between the Redcar 1st XV and a North Yorkshire side took place. The team of Bernard, Whitehill, Homan, Vickers, Dewar, Wood, Mackinlay, Coulson, Wright, Coyne, Shaw, Pacey, Kerruish, Hartley and Barnacal were defeated by 19pts to 4. Further developments have taken place over the years with the adding of first the television lounge, then the pool room and kitchen. With grant aid obtained from the foundation for sports and the arts of some £100k it was left to the management committee to raise the remaining capital needed to fund the project. It is history now but after much debate and some heated discussions the decision was taken to go ahead. Due to a great deal of hard work the club was able to open throughout the project and many of us will remember drinking under candle light surrounded on all sides by rubble. All for the good of the club of course. The only full international and England player who was a member of this club was Ged Dunn. Ged joined Redcar from school and formed a formidable centre partnership with Ron Fletcher. He was a naturally gifted player with an exhilarating burst of speed and when necessary a tenacious tackler. In 1970 he was playing for Redcar at the Bridlington 7's tournament when Hull Kingston rovers spotted him. They followed up their interest and Ged signed a rugby league contract in August 1971 for a four-figure sum. As he says it was a lot of money for a young student teacher worrying how to scrape enough money together for a holiday in St Tropez. He went on to play first for Yorkshire and then England touring to Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. Ged played 284 games for Hull K.R. and scored 160 tries.

Geography Kynuna is on the banks of the Diamantina River. The town is located on the Landsborough Highway, north west of the state capital, Brisbane and south east of the regional centre of Mount Isa. Kynuna lies at the northern rim of a roughly circular zone measuring some 130 km across that has been identified by Geoscience Australia as a crustal anomaly. Proof is currently lacking as to the cause, but it is believed likely that the anomaly was caused by an asteroid strike that happened about 300 million years ago. History The Wanamara lands ran from the north as far as Kynuna. Wanamarra (also known as Maykulan and Wunumura) is an Australian Aboriginal language in North West Queensland. The language region includes areas within the Shire of McKinlay, Shire of Cloncurry and Shire of Richmond, including the Flinders River area, and the towns of Kynuna and Richmond. The town was established as a shearer's union camp at a supply point for the nearby Kynuna pastoral station, at a place where five roads met the Diamantina River. The town was gazetted in 1894 and at one stage soon after had a population of around 700 people and was home to three pubs. Local legend claims that the suicide of a local shearer named Samuel Hoffmeister at Combo Waterhole near Kynuna in 1894 was the inspiration for the Banjo Paterson song \\"Waltzing Matilda\\". Paterson was at one time engaged to Sarah Riley, the daughter of a local squatter, and visited the area. Kynuna Post Office opened on 1 May 1883 (a receiving office had been open from 1882) and closed in 1990. At the 2006 census, Kynuna had a population of 95. Amenities Today, the town has one pub, the Blue Heeler Hotel. The pub was built as the Kynuna Hotel in 1889.

The name Çelebi is an honorific title meaning gentleman; see pre-1934 Turkish naming conventions. Background İsa was one of the sons of Beyazid I, the Ottoman sultan. His mother was Devletşah Hatun, the daughter of Süleyman Şah of Germiyanids and Mutahhara Abide Hatun bint-i Sultan Veled bin Mawlānā Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi. İsa worked as a sanjak governor in Antalya and fought in the Battle of Ankara in 1402 with his father. The Ottoman army was defeated, Beyazid I was captured by Timurlane, and İsa escaped to west Anatolia.  Ottoman Interregnum  In 1403, after learning about his father's death in captivity, he began to struggle for the vacant throne against his brothers Mehmet Çelebi, Musa Çelebi, and Süleyman Çelebi. He fought against Musa to gain control of Bursa, the Anatolian capital of the empire. He defeated Musa and won control of a part of Anatolian territory of the empire. But the European territory, Rumeli, was under the control of Süleyman and the east part of Anatolian territory was under the control of Mehmet (the future Mehmet I). Feeling his lands to be fragile situated between his brothers' on both sides, he signed a treaty of friendship with the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and refused Mehmet's suggestion to partition the Anatolian part of the empire with him, on the grounds that he was the older brother and was entitled the entirety of the territory. But following this refusal, he was defeated by Mehmet in the Battle of Ulubad in 1405. In this battle, he also lost his vizier Timurtaş, who was an experienced statesman. He escaped to Rumeli over Byzantine territories.Joseph von Hammer: Osmanlı Tarihi Vol I (condensation: Abdülkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayınları, İstanbul. p 55-56 He met with Süleyman, who supported his cause in Anatolia. With fresh troops provided by Süleyman, he returned to Anatolia and tried to recapture Bursa. Although he failed, allying himself with the Anatolian beyliks, which his father Beyazıt I had captured but which had regained independence after Beyazıt's defeat at the Battle of Ankara, he continued to fight against Mehmet. However, after a series of defeats and the betrayal of his allies, İsa gave up the war for the throne.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye Tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 72 According to historian Joseph von Hammer, after losing the struggle, İsa went into hiding. According to other sources, however, he was spotted in a public bath () in Eskişehir and killed by Mehmet's partisans in 1406. Aftermath After his death, the interregnum continued till 1413. In 1413, Mehmet became the sole ruler of the empire as Mehmet I after defeating Musa. Another one of the brothers, Mustafa Çelebi, who had been in hiding during the interregnum, later led two failed rebellions against the throne, one against Mehmet in 1416, and another in 1421 against his nephew Murat II.

Although he began writing as a modernist, in his later works he represented the intellectual movement in Japanese literature.Tchórzewska-Adamowska, Ewelina. Zimowa kwatera (orig. Fuyu-no Yado) (1973), Książka i Wiedza, UKD: 821.521-311.1 This movement departed from Japanese traditional thinking and from established forms of narration, which focused on esthetic values and emotional states of mind (such as appear in the works of Junichiro Tanizaki and Ryunosuke Akutagawa); it also departed from modernist views, which continued to be popular in world literature and in Japan (Japanese modernist writers included Haruo Satō, Sei Ito, Tatsuo Hori, Riichi Yokomitsu and Yasunari Kawabata). Abe's intellectual approach was incompatible with the socio-political atmosphere of Japan in the early Shōwa period (1925–1945), with rising fascism and militarism, and the crusade to preserve Japanese feudal traditions. Early life Tomoji Abe was born in Yunogō, Mimasaka, Okayama, the second son of Ryōhei Abe, a junior-high-school teacher of natural history, and his wife Hayo Mori. Ryōhei's job postings took his family to Yonago in Tottori Prefecture and Kizuchi in Shimane Prefecture; Tomoji attended Yōran elementary school, Himeji Middle School in Himeji, Hyōgo and Dai-hachi High School in Nagoya. In 1921, while in high school, Abe took a one-year leave to recover from a lung illness, which proved to be non- threatening, and during this year began to write tanka poems under the guidance of Kōhei. In 1923, Abe published his poems in Kōyukai Zasshi magazine. At this time he admired the tanka poet Akahiko Shimagi, and read the novels of Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov. In 1924, after finishing high school, Abe enrolled at Tokyo Imperial University's (now Tokyo University) Department of English Literature. He was particularly interested in the British Romantic poets of the 19th century. Abe's personal contact with foreign thinking and attitudes was through one of his teachers, the English poet Edmund Blunden who in 1924 taught English Literature there. Abe, together with Blunden's other students, at first surprised with the Englishman's informal and approachable manner and, perhaps with his pacifism, liked and admired him, and Abe later said that Blunden was Japan's best friend and brought out the best in them. Abe became acquainted with British modernism, and especially the concepts of intellectualism associated with T.E. Hulme, Herbert Read and T.S. Eliot.Tyler, William Jefferson. Modanizumu: Modernist Fiction from Japan, 1913–1938. University of Hawaii Press. 2008. ; In 1927, Abe graduated from Tokyo University with a thesis on Edgar Allan Poe as a poet and then enrolled in graduate school. Early work Tomoji Abe began his writing career as a modernist.Matsumura, Misako. Abe Tomoji, Japanese Modernist Novelist as Social Critic and Humanist, the Early Years (1925–1936). A Thesis Presented in Partial Fulfilment for the Degree Master of Arts in the Graduate School of The Ohio State University. 1998 In November 1925, while at university, he contributed his maiden work, Kasei (Metaplasia), and an essay, Kyoseisha no Tamashii (The Spirit of Rectifier) to Shumon (Red Gate), the Department of Literature's magazine. He became acquainted with the editor of Shumon, writer Seiichi Funabashi, who in 1967 received the Noma Literary Prize for Suki na Onna no Munakazari . Abe, Funabashi and others advocated modernism in opposition to Marxism. In 1926, Abe associated himself with Aozora (Blue Skies), a coterie magazine published by the young writers Motojirō Kajii and Nakatani Takao, and the then-budding poet and literary critic Tatsuji Miyoshi. In 1928, after Aozora folded in 1927, Abe contributed to another coterie literary magazine Bungei Toshi (Age of Art and Literature) with Seiichi Funabashi, the young writer Masuji Ibuse and the critic and writer Hidemi Kon. In 1929, partly in response to Ryunosuke Akutagawa's suicide, Abe wrote Shuchi-teki Bungaku-ron (On Intellectualist Literature), which he published in Shi to Shiron (Poetry and Poetic Theory) magazine, founded in the previous year by Tatsuji Miyoshi and the writer Sakutarō Hagiwara. Abe's professional debut was Nichi-Doku Taiko Kyōgi (The Japan-Germany Athletic Games); it appeared in the January 1930 issue of the avant-garde literary magazine Shinchō and was instantly welcomed as a promising young writer by the Shinkō Geijutsu (Modern Art) movement. The heroine, the young wife of an elderly professor, becomes erotically fascinated with German athletes, especially one of them, and in her thoughts succumbs to the sexual temptation though she never acts upon her impulses. The work is considered to have a feminist overtone because it exposes the unhappiness of an arranged marriage of a young woman to an elderly man. 1930 was the year in which Abe wrote several modernist-style short stories and in which Shuchi-teki Bungaku-ron was published by Kōseikaku in book form with other essays. Abe's last modernistic work, written in 1936, was . It became his acclaimed work and the basis for his post-war writing. It is the story of a Japanese family split between the debauched, wasteful and cruel husband, Kamon Kirishima, and his devout Christian wife, Matsuko, sexually repressed, whose forbearance seems limitless. However, there is an undertone of desire to control in Masako's patience. The narrator, who witnesses their lives, recounts the story in calm, objective manner. Despite this cool, formal objectivism, however, the novel disconcerts by exposing the irrational complexity of human psyche with its antagonistic forces and repressed desires, the conflict between two fundamental elements of human nature—instinct and intelligence. On another level, Fuyu no Yado is seen as Abe's attack on Japan's strengthening nationalistic fascism, which is represented by Masako's manipulations to convert others to Christianity, while the negative consequences of her efforts, her declining health, the disintegration of the family and its final destruction, predicts the country’s future. Post-war work Tomoji Abe's post-war writing had a humanistic and socio-critical nature. He opposed militarism and exploitation of human beings, and urged respect for human dignity (Ningen Besshi ni Kōshite —Resisting Contempt for Human Beings—essay, 1955). His novel Shiroi Tō (White Pillar), expressed anti-militaristic views and spoke against the excesses of financial/business monopolies. Intellectually independent and uncompromising, Abe was among the writers who believed in the need of rebirth of literature. He believed that literature, and writers, should be useful to society and stimulate its progress, and wrote, apart from works of fiction, numerous essays and theoretical works in which he expressed these views. Personal life Abe married Sumiko Ohama in 1930. They had two sons, Yoshio (born 1932) who became a scholar and professor of French literature, and Nobuo (born 1948) who became a critic and chief curator at the Bridgestone Art Museum, and three daughters, Hiroko (born 1937), Michiko (born 1941), and Noriko (born 1944). In May 1944, his family evacuated to Himeji to escape expected bombing while he remained in Tokyo; in the same month his father died. In July 1945, Abe removed to Mimasaka in Okayama to escape the intensive bombing of Tokyo and in November, three months after Japan's capitulation, he joined his family in Himeji. In April 1950, Abe traveled to Hiroshima with other writers, among them Yasunari Kawabata) for a meeting of the Japan Pen Club and delivered a lecture on \\"War and Peace\\". He continued to be interested in Marxism but in the atmosphere of Cold War was cautious about revealing his interests and political views.Sherif, Ann. Japan's Cold War: Media, Literature and the Law, Columbia University Press Abe returned to Tokyo at the end of 1950. In 1953, Abe stood at the bar as special defender in connection with the May Day Incident of 1 May 1952, when, during the May Day demonstration, a Communist-led group forced its way to Imperial Plaza; in the subsequent clash between demonstrators and police people on both sides were killed and injured. In March 1959, Abe and Kiyoshi Aono issued a written protest against the revision of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. Abe was a passionate and outspoken critic of the Vietnam War. In May 1965, Abe, Rokurō Hidaka, a prominent academic and author of The Price of Affluence: Dilemmas of Contemporary Japan, and Yoshio Nakano, editor of the left-wing journal Heiwa (\\"Peace\\") protested against the Vietnam War and called for a united anti-war movement. In October 1966, Abe and Nakano called for a strike against the Vietnam War. In March 1968, Abe resigned from Meiji University and, with scientist Minoru Oda, called for a nationwide movement against the Vietnam War. In 1969, on a trip with his wife to Europe, Abe visited Edmund Blunden, his university lecturer. In November 1971, Abe was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus and hospitalised. He died on 23 April 1973, leaving an unfinished novel, Hoshū, which he had been dictating in his last year of life and which was published posthumously.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 as Bridge No. L-5573 for having local significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for being an example of early steel truss bridge design in Minnesota. With seven photos. Structure The Clinton Falls Bridge is a single span, pin-connected steel Pratt through truss structure on concrete and limestone abutments. The overall dimension of the combined substructure and superstructure is by . The superstructure is eight panels and includes a floor system made up of treated timbers on steel I-section stringers which are themselves supported by steel I-section floor beams. These beams are fastened to the hip verticals with riveted plates and are riveted directly to the intermediate posts, except for one exception: the first post to the east on the south side is welded to the floor beam with a steel plate set off-center; it is uncertain whether this was a repair or a correction of the design as it was being built. Both top and bottom lateral bracing consists of eye rods stabilized at intersecting points with bolted plates. The top chords, end posts, and intermediate posts are channels with riveted cover plates and lacing bars. The hip verticals are double forged eye rods, while the diagonals are double punched eye bars. The counters are turnbuckles. The lateral and portal struts are double angles to which portal bracing (double angles) is connected with ledger plates. The portal struts and bracing make up a riveted unit which is bolted to the end posts. wooden guard rails are bolted to the bridge with angle sections. A builder's plate is fastened to the top portal struts at each end of the bridge. The concrete, poured onto the limestone abutments and wing walls, was added in 1975; other than that, the bridge is essentially in original condition. A fragmentary abutment, which supported an earlier, shorter structure at the same crossing, is located west of the current east bank abutment. History Settlement in the area of Clinton Falls Township began in the 1850s; by 1855, Steele County was created and the township officially designated. Clinton Falls was one of the county's first settlements, flourishing in large part because of the establishment of the first gristmill in the county. That mill and its associated dam were listed together on the National Register from 1986 until they were removed in 2004. The builder's plate of the Clinton Falls Bridge The current bridge is the second bridge built on the site. In 1867, the people of Steele County voted to build a covered bridge for approximately $3,000 (). It is believed that some of the abutments for that original bridge were used in the present one. On May 19, 1894, the Clinton Falls Township Board voted to build an \\"iron bridge\\" with steel joists over the river and awarded a contract to the George E. King Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The existing covered bridge was demolished in late September 1894.\\"Clinton Falls.\\", Owatonna Journal, September 21, 1894. The old bridge was removed by September 27 and a large force began rapidly installing the new structure in its place.\\"Clinton Falls.\\", Owatonna Journal, September 28, 1894. The new bridge was finished on October 2, 1894, and was described as \\"all iron and steel, except the planks and railing.\\"\\"Clinton Falls.\\", Owatonna Journal, October 5, 1894. On December 3, 1894, the Steele County Board agree to assume 60% of the cost of the bridge. The bridge was considered as an option for planners of the Jefferson Highway.\\"New M. T. H. 1 Route Surveyed by Crew\\", Owatonna Journal, April 14, 1922. Over the decades, Clinton Falls Township faded away: the town's mill, school, church, store and post office all closed and the bridge became one of the few historic structures left. In 1970, the bridge was declared unsafe for vehicles and in need of repairs estimated at $3,000 (). With few residents living on one side, the Township Board elected to close the bridge to all traffic. The plan was met with vehement opposition from residents on the isolated side of the bridge.Marshall Tanick, \\"Clinton Falls Residents Fear Isolation\\", Photo News. Owatonna, April 9, 1970.\\"Bridge Will Remain, But Closed To Traffic\\", Photo News. Owatonna, April 16, 1970. The situation was resolved when Reuben Kaplan, owner of the locally founded Owatonna Tool Company, donated the money to repair the abutments and cement work and put in new wood planks and railings. It carried Township Road 95 before it was closed to traffic again in 1994, its 100th year. The Minnesota Department of Transportation made the decision after inspectors discovered that some of the steel stringers supporting the bridge deck had become dangerously thin from rust. Inspectors estimated repairs would total $105,981 to bring the bridge up to a five-ton standard weight limit.Steve Gravelle, \\"Clinton Falls cash chasm rocks bridge\\", Owatonna People's Press, June 21, 1994. Local residents formed the \\"Save the Clinton Falls Bridge Committee\\" to raise money to repair the bridge as well as push for historic preservation. Concerned residents contacted the Minnesota Historical Society, which vetted their claims and hired a historian to prepare its NRHP nomination, which was successful.Steve Gravelle, \\"Clinton Falls residents seek long life span for old bridge\\", Pioneer Press, August 28, 1995. The bridge remains closed to traffic. Significance The Clinton Falls Bridge is significant as an example of early steel truss bridge design in Minnesota. Highway bridges were an important part of European-American settlement in Minnesota. Wood and combination wood-iron bridges in various truss configurations were an important method of building medium and long spans, while masonry arch construction was preferred for short spans. Initially, wrought iron and wood were used in combination on Howe truss configurations. These bridges peaked in popularity in the 1870s. All-iron construction started to appear with bowstring arch bridges, but by the 1880s the pin-connected Pratt through truss had become the standard structural type for long span bridges in Minnesota. Steel was first used in truss bridge design in the form of connecting eye bars, but by 1895 it had replaced wrought iron in nearly all structural members.

The Stad Ship Tunnel () is a planned canal and tunnel to bypass the Stad peninsula in Stad Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The peninsula is one of the most exposed areas on the coast, without any outlying islands to protect it from the weather. The section has traditionally been one of the most dangerous along the coast of Norway. Two paths have been proposed: one long from the Eide farm at the inner part of the Moldefjorden through the Mannseidet isthmus to the Kjødspollen (the inner part of the Vanylvsfjorden), the narrowest but innermost place of the peninsula. The other option is a slightly longer tunnel from the Skårbø farm to the Fløde farm through the central part of the peninsula. In 2013, the tunnel was included for the first time in the National Transport Plan. was set aside for it in the budget. The tunnel will be high and wide, able to handle ships of up to , large enough for the Hurtigruten coastal express ships. The water will be deep in the tunnel. Terje Andreassen is the project manager and he states that construction is expected to start, at the earliest, in 2019. The tunnel may be open by 2025. History The first proposal was in an article in Nordre Bergenhus Amtstidende newspaper in 1874, and shortly afterwards an article in the same newspaper proposed a railway tunnel across the peninsula. The latter would have allowed the boats to be raised onto wagons and to be hauled across, and would cost only half as much. In 2011, a report by Det Norske Veritas and Institute for Research in Economics and Business Administration for the Norwegian Coastal Administration concluded that a tunnel would not be economical. It looked at two sizes, small and large, which would cost respectively. The report concluded that the utility, including saved waiting costs, for shippers have a present value of , respectively, and in saved accident costs. A similar report from 2007 concluded that the tunnel would be economical. The Coastal Administration stated that the differences were because of new and better data.

In 2015, Buddha was enshrined into the Lawrence Boys & Girls Clubs' Hall Of Fame. Bridging the gap Over the last few years, the urban music industry has seen an evolution bridging together forms of music from the streets from different cultures, including hip hop, R&B;, Jamaican reggae and Latin music. Within this movement, DJ Buddha has also developed and evolved into becoming an integral player in the future expansion of these genres. Buddha was associated with team, La Favela, in the form of a mixtape and a movement called “Caribbean Connection,” which delivered a continuous mix of Dancehall reggae and reggaetón. Along with the “Caribbean Connection” and ‘Tropical Heat” series, he has created hundreds of mixtapes which were critically acclaimed in various articles from: Fader, Rolling Stone, NY Times, Boston Globe, Boston Herald, Miami Herald, Ozone Magazine, MTV.com, Billboard.com, etc. DJ Buddha has showcased his talent, performing in 6 out of 7 continents. He has also recently released a mix album titled \\"Ultra.Latino\\" which hit #2 on iTunesiTunes - Music - Ultra.Latino (Mixed By DJ Buddha) by DJ Buddha Latin within the 1st week of its release date. His creativity and gift of music, is what helps him continue to bring forth new, improved and different sounds. Collaborations DJ Buddha soon began building relationships with the artists whose music he had been promoting. He worked alongside with reggae artist, Mighty Mystic in which he began creating records and collaborating with other reggae artists such as Mr. Easy, Tantro Metro & Devonte, Mr. Vegas, Red Rat, and T.O.K. It was when he met dancehall reggae group, T.O.K. that he became their official DJ for about 6 years. While on the road with T.O.K., Buddha created the remix for \\"Gal Yuh A Lead\\", featuring T.O.K., Beenie Man, & Nina Sky, which was one of his first songs to gain major airplay. He also created two different promotional mixtape samplers of T.O.K and Lady Saw for reggae indie label VP Records. He has worked on remixes with other artists like Pitbull, Daddy Yankee, Machel Montano, Lil Jon, N.O.R.E., etc. In 2004 Daddy Yankee's “Gasolina\\" was remixed by DJ Buddha, featuring Cuban-American rapper, Pitbull and N.O.R.E., and first appeared on Caribbean Connection Volume 2. It was a smash hit. Later that summer, Lil Jon mixed his own vocals to the remix, which was featured on his Crunk Juice album. In 2005 he teamed up with Pitbull again on \\"She's Hotter Remix\\" featuring T.O.K. He later became Pitbull's official DJ and joined him on the road for the next 6 years. Buddha has been a part of the 25th anniversary of Michael Jackson's Bad album, doing the 2012 edit of Bad with Afrojack & Pitbull. Also co-produced with Marc Kinchen & Big Syphe the theme song for the Men In Black 3 film, titled \\"Back In Time\\". Buddha recently (2014) won a grammy for his work on the song Echa Pa'lla (Manos Pa'rriba) - Pitbull featuring Papayo. In 2016, Buddha was the music superviser to the Nick Cannon directed feature film, King of the Dancehall (film). 2017, Buddha released his first single with dancehall artist Munga, titled WAAR, which has over 15 million streams on Spotify.

Moorend Spout Moorend Spout in snow, January 2011 Moorend Spout lies on six acres of land between Tickenham and Nailsea (ST466715), which was purchased in 2009 with a grant provided by the Landfill Communities Fund.http://www.parishresources.org.uk/funding/FG13%20Landfill%20Communities%20Fund.pdf The site comprises wet meadow lying between the rivers Land Yeo and Middle Yeo. Many springs arise in the Alder carr, and a waterfall flows under a bridge carrying the public footpath. Wetland habitats like this are rapidly being lost in the UK. This area is low lying and waterlogged, and traversed by a well-used public footpath. It is now owned and managed by a charitable trust (Nailsea Environment & Wildlife Trust; NEWT). The trustees are hoping to restore the orchids that grew there only a short time ago. Many insects, including dragonflies and damselflies, are present, together with Kingfishers and Otters. Netcott’s Meadow Bee orchids at Netcott's Meadow, June 2000 Netcott’s Meadow is a small area of damp grassland to the North of Backwell Lake (ST476695). It was managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust but owned privately. It is no longer accessible to the public. It has abundant wild flowers best seen in early June. Several species of orchids grow here, including the Common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), Southern Marsh Orchid (Dactylorhiza praetermissa) and Green-winged Orchid (Orchis morio), and in some years there are many Bee Orchids (Ophrys apifera), although these may be absent at other times. Yellow Rattle (Rhinanthus minor) also grows here, a plant that is parasitic on various grasses and other plants, which has seeds that rattle when shaken, as its name implies. Stockway North Nature Reserve Open day at Stockway North Nature Reserve Stockway North Nature Reserve is in the 19th century Pennant Sandstone quarries behind the Garden of Rest and occupy about 0.75 acres in the centre of Nailsea (ST472708). After being filled with domestic refuse in the early 20th century, these were neglected, and with natural regeneration it was occupied by local wildlife. Work to restore the site started in 1996, when much of the urban rubbish was removed. With financial assistance from Nailsea Town Council and North Somerset Council, a group – The Friends of Stockway North Nature Reserve – was formed in 1998 to manage this land, involving the community in a project to encourage the wildlife, to raise awareness of the public to the natural environment, as a teaching resource for schools, and as an extension to the adjacent Garden of Rest. Backwell Lake Backwell Lake(ST478694, also known as Bucklands Pool) was constructed by Wessex Water and came into use in 1978 as a balancing pond to control the surface water between the Weston-super-Mare to Bristol railway line and the new estates built to the south of Nailsea, preventing the flooding of the River Kenn. The lake is quite shallow, being at most about 2 metres deep and occupies an area of about 4 hectares. It is now a significant wildlife site, designated as a Local Nature Reserve that attracts many water birds. The Lake is open to the public, but fishing is restricted. It is used by many people for walking, dog exercise, bird watching and fishing. Jubilee Stone Wood and Badgers Wood Nature Reserves Jubilee Stone, Backwell Jubilee Stone Wood and Badgers Wood Nature Reserves (ST495679) are primarily broadleaf woodland with open areas of limestone grassland. Both reserves are located high above the historic village of Backwell, North Somerset. They are home to many rare species, including the Hazel Dormouse, Greater Horseshoe Bat and the Yellow Birds-nest plant (Monotropa hypopitys). They also have some fascinating archaeology dating back over 5000 years with an adjacent Neolithic human burial cave, a 14th-century rabbit warren and cottage, 17th-century lead mines and a 19th-century limekiln. Nowhere Wood Nowhere Wood is a small wood, also known as Trendlewood (ST480703). The name Trendlewood appears to mean 'round wood' and the name Nowhere Wood is derived from a small hamlet linked to the village by Nowhere Lane that still runs through the wood. The wood contains several Pennant Sandstone quarries, abandoned about 1900. The trees and shrubs have grown to cover the spoil heaps, and vegetation overhangs the rock face. Squirrels have built their drays in the trees and at dusk the bats come out to forage. A group, The Friends of Trendlewood Park, has now been established to restore the wood, the surrounding parkland and meadows and to encourage the wildlife. Tyntesfield Ladies tresses orchid in Tyntesfield lawn Sept 2004 Tyntesfield (ST505712), formerly the home of the Gibbs family, came on to the market in 2002 and was acquired by the National Trust with assistance from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and many local private benefactors. It is surrounded by 200 Ha of gardens, farmland and unspoilt woodland. Much of this still remains to be explored, though it is clear that there is considerable potential for wildlife. The buildings contain several bat roosts and eight species of bat are known to live in this area, notably the Lesser Horseshoe Bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), which roost in the courtyard. Over 90 individuals of this endangered species have been counted there. Other bat species found include the Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), Brown Long-eared Bat (Plecotus auritus), and Serotine Bat (Eptesicus serotinus), Whiskered Bat (Myotis sp), and the two Pipistrelle species, (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus). The female Glow Worm (Lampyris noctiluca) may be seen on a warm June night in the area close to the house at Tyntesfield. These beetles are in rapid decline, probably due to the increase in urban lights that may distract the males. Their food is mainly snails and slugs, which are in plentiful supply in this area. The orchid Autumn Ladies Tresses (Spiranthes spiralis) grows in the lawn outside the main house. Polo- oak seat in Towerhouse Wood Towerhouse Wood Towerhouse Wood (ST475719) is a site of semi-natural ancient woodland about 1 km to the north of Nailsea owned by The Woodland Trust which is famous for its Bluebells, veteran Oaks and for its pond, which is constantly producing bubbles of gas. Unfortunately, the Wood is being invaded by alien trees and shrubs that could overwhelm our native plants if they are not controlled. A large variety of wild animals are found in the Wood, now including Dormice, Rabbits, Roe Deer, Badgers, Grey Squirrels, and five species of bat. A lime kiln marked on a map dated 1769 is found on private land in the NW corner of the wood. To the south of the Wood there is a Mesolithic site first studied in 1956Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological Society vol. 104, p. 106 (1959/1960)Paula Gardiner, Council for British Archaeology pp. 40–42 (1998) which yielded many worked flints. St George’s Flower Bank St George’s Flower Bank (ST 507753), which is adjacent to the main Portishead to Bristol road (A369), is owned by North Somerset Council and managed by volunteers. Seeds that lay dormant in the 'seed-bank' until the soil was disturbed, produced wildflowers that have become rare in other places. The site is managed as a traditional hay meadow, scything, and removing the grass in late July. Scrub and trees that normally cover roadsides are kept in check, and this management has produced a site that has now been officially designated as a Local Nature Reserve.

Opened in 1862, it forms part of the Padua–Bologna railway, and is also a terminus of three secondary railways, linking Ferrara with Ravenna and Rimini, Suzzara, and Codigoro, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services on the main line, and on the line to Ravenna and Rimini, are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Train services on the other two lines, to Suzzara and Codigoro, are operated by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna (FER), which is owned by the region of Emilia- Romagna and most of its provinces. Location Ferrara railway station is situated at Piazzale della Stazione, at the northwestern edge of the city centre, between Via San Giacomo and Viale della Costituzione. History The station was opened on 26 January 1862, together with the rest of the Bologna–Ferrara section of the Padua–Bologna railway. Three months later, on 15 April 1862, Ferrara was transformed from a terminal station into a through station, when the next section of that railway, from Ferrara to Pontelagoscuro, came into operation. Features Overview of Piazzale della Stazione. Today's passenger building, renovated several times over the years, has a central hall with a ticket office and waiting room. In its two lateral wings, there are a bar, restaurant, newsagent and tobacconist, and a bicycle storage area. The station also has two underground pedestrian underpasses that connect the first track with the remaining 5 served by three platforms. Outside the building, there are a taxi stand, the large parking area for bicycles (300 places), car parking (60 spaces), motorcycle parking (40 spaces), a two lane bus station for urban buses and, across the street, four bus stops for suburban buses. Redevelopment work Currently, the comune of Ferrara is working on the redevelopment of the station, including the insertion of a new roundabout access from Viale della Costituzione, the construction of public parking for bikes and cars and the addition of special shelters for urban buses. The station is also affected by work on the extension of the Bologna metropolitan railway service (SFM), as it is to be a terminus of an SFM Ferrara–Bologna–Imola line. Additionally, the station will be a terminus of a commuter service, to be introduced in the urban section (as far as Quartesana) of the FER line to Codigoro. Passenger and train movements The station has about 5 million passenger movements each year. The passenger trains calling at the station include regional, express, InterCity, and Eurostar trains. A total of about 220 passenger trains serve the station each day.

Life He was born on 3 April 1756, at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, he was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, was ordained deacon in the Scottish episcopal church on 1 July 1776, and admitted priest on 19 March 1777. He was appointed to the congregation at Turriff, Aberdeenshire, taking at the same time occasional duty at Parkdargue (Forgue), and then at Banff and Portsoy. At the desire of Robert Kilgour, Bishop of Aberdeen, Jolly in April 1788 left Turriff for Fraserburgh. 24 June 1796 he was chosen coadjutor to Andrew MacFarlane, bishop of Moray and Ross. After two years of nominal coadjutorship, he was collated (22 February 1798) to the sole episcopal charge of the lowland diocese of Moray, which the bishops had in Jolly's interest disjoined from the highland dioceses of Ross and Argyll, in spite of the opposition of the primus William Skinner. Jolly continued to discharge at the same time the duties of an ordinary pastor in Fraserburgh, where he lived by himself in a plain two-story house in Cross Street. He kept no regular servant, and preferred seclusion. He read daily a fixed number of pages of the Hebrew bible and the Greek New Testament, and portions of the Church Fathers, especially John Chrysostom and Augustine of Hippo. He spent his savings from his income in charity or on books. He declined in 1819 the offer of the see of Ross and Argyll. In 1826 he received the degree of D.D. from Washington College, Connecticut now Trinity College. He died at Fraserburgh on 29 June 1838, and was buried on 5 July beside his brother James in Turriff churchyard. A mural tablet was erected to his memory in the church. His library, which he left to the church, was deposited in the institute in Hill Street, Edinburgh. In his lectures on the church of Scotland, delivered in Edinburgh in 1872, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley selected Jolly ‘as a choice specimen of the old episcopalian clergy.’ Works In 1783 he published at Edinburgh ‘Instructions concerning the Nature and Constitution of the Christian Church, the Divine Appointment of its Governors and Pastors, and the nature and guilt of Schism’ (reprinted at Oxford in 1840 and by the Scottish Tract Society in 1849). During 1826 he published a short treatise entitled ‘A Friendly Address to the Episcopalians of Scotland on Baptismal Regeneration,’ a reply to the attacks made on Scottish episcopal teaching by the Rev. Edward Craig of Edinburgh. Later editions issued in 1840, 1841, and 1850 contain a memoir of the bishop by Patrick Cheyne. Jolly's most popular work was ‘Observations upon the several Sunday Services and principal Holydays prescribed by the Liturgy throughout the Year,’ 1828; 3rd edit., Edinburgh, 1840, with memoir by James Walker, bishop and primus.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The oldest surviving part of the church is the south doorway which dates from the 12th century. Some stone from the 13th century has been incorporated elsewhere into the fabric. The south aisle and its arcade were built in the 14th century, and in about 1330 the chancel was built and the nave was rebuilt. The west tower was added in the late 14th century. In 1874 a new south porch was built to replace an older porch, and the chancel, nave and aisle were restored. Restoration of the tower took place in 1899. Architecture The church is constructed in rubble and ashlar, with dressings in Ketton and Barnack stone; it has a lead roof. Its plan consists of a nave with a south aisle, a clerestory, and a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower which is partly enclosed within the nave. The tower is in two stages and stands on a moulded plinth. It has an embattled parapet with gargoyles at the corners, and an octagonal spire. The gabled porch stands in centre of the south aisle, and leads to the Norman south doorway. In the south wall of the aisle are two three-light windows, one on each side of the porch. Along the south wall of the clerestory are four two-light windows. The chancel contains two two-light windows dating from about 1330, and a south doorway. Inside the church, there is a four-bay arcade carried on octagonal piers. In the chancel is a 14th-century piscina, and a three-seated sedilia. There is another 14th-century piscina in the south aisle. The font dates from the 16th century and consists of an octagonal bowl in Ketton stone on an octagonal stem, standing on a chamfered base. Its oak cover dates possibly from the 17th century. Near the south door is a 12th-century stoup. Also in the church are memorials from the 17th century, the oldest being dated 1640.

Studies  The BCGS is open to excellent students from all over the world after the completion of their Bachelor's degree, scholarships are available already for the Master's course on a competitive basis (admission academy). In the BCGS, the transition from masters to PhD studies is intended to be seamless, although two separate degrees are awarded. Two of the schools principles are an early introduction to current research (early on research) during and even before work on their masters thesis and continued learning during the PhD phase. During their entire studies, each student is mentored by two professors, one from each university. = Lectures = The BCGS allows students to attend courses in Cologne and Bonn. To facilitate this, some Lectures are transmitted as video conferences. Others take place at both universities in turn. In addition, intensive weeks take place outside of the regular lecture period. Here, students and lecturers spend one week working full-time on a specific topic.  Recurring events  During the academic year, the BCGS has several fixed events. Usually, each event alternates between Bonn and Cologne. Shortly after the start of the winter term in early autumn, the welcome meeting introduces new students to the school. An invited speaker gives a talk about a current topic in physics. Past speakers have included Michael Berry and Walter Kutschera. A poster session in spring is an opportunity for older students to present their research topics and results. The presenting students receive feedback and new stimuli for their work, and younger students can get an overview of the current research topics pursued at both universities. In the summer, a physicist will talk about his career after leaving university under the heading Science meets Business.

At the beginning of the 1980s, together with a group of young Serbian artists in Belgrade: Milovan Destil Marković, Vlasta Vulcano Mikic, Tahir Lusic, Nada Alavanja, Tafil Musović, Mrdjan Bajic, Slobodan Trajkovic etc., as an art critic, Despotović participated in the creation and development of New Wave in art and culture which opposed to traditional creativity in all areas – from visual arts to rock music, from theater to fashion and others. With numerous writings and art exhibitions Despotović contributed to this movement known as a New Image Painting (Nova Slika) to become very known in Serbia, former Yugoslavia and abroad.Ješa Denegri, Osamdesete – Teme srpske umetnosti, Jesa Denegri, Eighties – Issues of Serbian art (Svetovi, Novi Sad, 1997, p.p. 61–88, 108–113, 114–120, 121–125, 126–130, 131–133, 149–152, 153–157, 176–179, 180–190, 196–201, 210–222, 223 – 231) Cultural policy Since the turn of the nineteenth to twentieth century, Despotović has been extremely interested in cultural policy, an active movement for political change and changes in arts and culture.Ješa Denegri, Devedesete – Teme srpske umetnosti, Jesa Denegri, Nineties – Issues of Serbian art (Svetovi, Novi Sad, 1999, p.p. 5–21, 22–81, 82–87, 244–250) The effort to establish a new, democratic order in the 1990s brought together many intellectuals, artists, NGOs, etc. For his contributions, Despotović was named Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Culture during Zoran Đinđić's term as Prime Minister. He made a lasting contribution to the renewal of institutions, ministerial staffing, legislation of cultural activities and increased international cooperation. A special area of interest for him was the advancement of contemporary artistic production and the institutions engaged in it. He has made a significant contribution to the protection of Serbia's cultural heritage, especially in Kosovo following the arrival of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.

Traditionally they have rendered a variety of services in the Sri Vaishnava temples as mendicants, singers, torch-bearers at festivals, makers of umbrellas and flower garlands, archakas (priests) of minor temples, guardians of temple properties etc. They are also present in smaller numbers in Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. They are also variously known as Chatani, Chatadi, Chattada Sri Vaishnavas, Sathatha Sri Vaishnavas, Ayyawar, Vira Vaishnava, Vighas etc. They have claimed Brahmin status, although this has been contested by Brahmins. They are currently included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) list by the state governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Origin The name 'Satani' is supposed to be a corruption of 'chyatani' or 'chyati' which means \\"acting according to prescribed rites\\". They are said to be a caste of mixed origins recruited from various castes like Sale (weavers), Darji (tailors), Golla (herdsmen) etc. In their social and religious customs, the community is associated with the Tenkalai movement of Sri Vaishnava faith propounded by Ramanuja. Whilst Ramanuja himself probably expressed no preference, the Tengalais, or \\"southerners\\", preferred Tamil language religious texts and their counterparts, the Vadagalais (\\"northerners\\") were in favour of Sanskrit sources. The two groups also had doctrinal differences regarding such things as the nature of salvation. The cumulative effect of these differences was that the Tengalai were more liberal, radical and socially inclusive than the Vadagalai, and thus attracted to their ranks a larger number of people from castes that were considered to be low in status and, indeed, people who were thought to be completely outside the caste system. Request for name change Originally known as Satani, Sattada, Chattada or Chatadi, the 1931 Census Report for Mysore stated that \\"the request that the name Satani to be changed to Sattada Sri Vaishnava could not be accepted because Sri Vaishnava is the name of a distinctive group of Brahmins and Satani community is not generally treated as a Brahmin community. The adoption of the new name could be misleading.\\" Many communities were attempting to claim Brahmin status there at that time, and British Raj officials had previously treated Satanis as being a mixed community of non- Brahmins who had in common their adherence to the Tengalai movement and various forms of temple service. History There are several sub-sects among the Sathatha Sri Vaishnava. Many follow a lifestyle like that of the Iyengars. Their names have the honorary suffix Ayyangar and the title acharya, swamy. They especially revere the Sankha, the Chakra, the Naamam, Hanuman and Garuda. Above all, they honour the Alvars, especially Nammalvar. They recite and use only the Alvar's hymns for domestic rituals. Most are disciples of the Koil Annan and Acharya Purusha of Srirangam. Some follow the Vaanamaamalai Math and others the Para Vastu Math at Tirupati. The Srirangam Kovil Olugu records that this community served in the Srirangam temple at the time of Ramanuja and that he assigned them special duties and services in his reorganisation of the temple. They were also prominent in Srirangam and Kanchipuram (15th and 16th centuries) under the leadership of Kanudaadi Ramanujuayyangar, who was a disciple of both Koil Annan at Srirangam and Azhagiyamanaavala Jeeyar at Kancheepuram Varadarajaswami temple. They were in charge of Ramanuja Kootams.
