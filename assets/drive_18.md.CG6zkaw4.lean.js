Solar golf carts are golf carts powered by mounting a photovoltaic (PV) or thin film panel on top of the existing roof or using a PV panel as the roof itself. A controller converts the sun's energy to charge the golf cart's 36-volt or 48-volt battery bank. Not only does the solar power take the cart off the electric grid, it also increases the driving distance and extends the life of the batteries. Solar conversion kits have been available for golf carts and Low Speed Vehicles (LSV) for several years. These kits range from low wattage solar battery chargers to a 410-watt array on an 8-passenger transport cart. Kits utilizing flexible solar panels are often preferred on golf carts due to their light weight and ability to conform to the shape of the cart roof. Buyers can take a solar tax credit of 30% of the purchase price on their US Federal Income Tax. Solar-powered golf carts are popular with owners who drive long distances, such as maintenance workers, golf course fleets, staff at the Detroit Zoo, transportation vehicles in resorts and cities, and drivers of VIP carts on college campuses. High schools have used them as teaching tools for solar power. For the environmentally-conscious and campers and hunters who are away from electrical power, the solar-powered golf cart reduces or eliminates the need to plug in. Converting a golf cart to solar power creates a true solar electric vehicle.

Ecological fitting is \\"the process whereby organisms colonize and persist in novel environments, use novel resources or form novel associations with other species as a result of the suites of traits that they carry at the time they encounter the novel condition.\\" It can be understood as a situation in which a species' interactions with its biotic and abiotic environment seem to indicate a history of coevolution, when in actuality the relevant traits evolved in response to a different set of biotic and abiotic conditions. The simplest form of ecological fitting is resource tracking, in which an organism continues to exploit the same resources, but in a new host or environment. In this framework, the organism occupies a multidimensional operative environment defined by the conditions in which it can persist, similar to the idea of the Hutchinsonian niche. In this case, a species can colonize new environments (e.g. an area with the same temperature and water regime) and/or form new species interactions (e.g. a parasite infecting a new host) which can lead to the misinterpretation of the relationship as coevolution, although the organism has not evolved and is continuing to exploit the same resources it always has. The more strict definition of ecological fitting requires that a species encounter an environment or host outside of its original operative environment and obtain realized fitness based on traits developed in previous environments that are now co-opted for a new purpose. This strict form of ecological fitting can also be expressed either as colonization of new habitat or the formation of new species interactions.  Origin  The evolutionary ecologist Dr. Daniel Janzen began to explicate the idea of ecological fitting with a 1980 paper that observed that many instances of ecological interactions were inferred to be the result of coevolution when this was not necessarily the case, and encouraged ecologists to use the term coevolution more strictly.Kull, Kalevi (2020). Semiotic fitting and the nativeness of community. Biosemiotics 13(1): 9‚Äì19. He observed that the existing defense traits of plants were likely produced by co-evolution with herbivores or parasites that no longer co-occurred with the plants, but that these traits were continuing to protect the plants against new attacks. He expanded this idea in a 1985 paper written while visiting Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica. While there, he observed that almost all of the species in the park occupied large geographic ranges, and despite the heterogeneity of habitats across these ranges, individuals were mostly identical across locations, indicating that little local adaptation had taken place. He described the cyclical life history pattern he believed responsible for this pattern: a species begins as a small population occupying a small area with little genetic variation, but then over the course of a few generations grows to occupy a large area, either because of the emergence of a genotype successful over a wider range, or because of the removal of a geographic barrier. This large interconnected population is now subject to many contradictory selection pressures and thus remains evolutionarily static until a disturbance separates populations, restarting the cycle. This cyclic life history pattern is dependent on three premises: that the ancestral range of most species is smaller than the ones now occupied, that biological communities have porous borders and are thus subject to invasion, and that species possess robust genotypes that allow them to colonize new habitats without evolution. Thus, many biological communities may be made up of organisms that despite their complex biological interactions have very little evolutionary history with each other.  Contrasting views  Ecological fitting represents a contrasting view to, and null hypothesis for, the hypothesis that current species interactions are evidence of coevolution. Coevolution occurs when each species in a relationship imposes evolutionary selection on the other(s). Examples could include mutualisms or predator-prey systems. The traditional view of plant-insect, host-parasite, and other tightly associated species, explained by Ehrlich & Raven (1964) defines coevolution as the primary mechanism for these associations In his 1980 paper, Janzen gives a response to these adaptationist explanations of why a phenotype or species might exist in a particular environment, and expressed his concern with what he perceived as an overuse of coevolutionary explanations for current species associations. He stated that it would be difficult to distinguish between coevolution and ecological fitting, leading ecologists to potentially spurious explanations of current species associations. It is difficult to determine whether a close relationship is the result of coevolution or of ecological fitting because ecological fitting is a sorting process in which only associations that 'fit', or increase fitness (biology), will be maintained. When trying to determine which process is at work in a particular interaction, it is important to remember that species can only come into contact through biotic expansion and ecological fitting, followed by adaptation or coevolution. Thus, both processes are important in shaping interactions and communities.  Mechanisms  Ecological fitting can occur by a variety of mechanisms, and can help to explain some ecological phenomena. Resource tracking can help to explain the parasite paradox: that parasites are specialists with narrow environmental ranges, which would encourage host fidelity, yet scientists commonly observe parasite shifts onto novel hosts, both in the phylogenetic record and in ecological time. Ecological fitting can explain the frequency of this phenomenon: similar to the expansion phase of the cyclic life cycle described by Janzen, a species undergoes taxon pulses, usually in a time of ecological disturbance, and expands its range, disperses, and colonizes new areas. For parasite-host, insect-plant, or plant-pollinator associations, this colonization is facilitated by the organism tracking an ancestral resource, and not tracking a particular species. The probability of this is increased when the tracked resource is widespread, or when specialization on a certain resource is a shared trait among distantly related species. This resource tracking has been demonstrated for both insect-plant and parasite-host systems in which sister species are capable of surviving on each other's hosts, even if they were never associated in nature. When operating under the more strict definition of ecological fitting, in which traits must be exapted for a new purpose, several mechanisms could be operating. Phenotypic plasticity, in which an organism changes phenotype in response to environmental variables, allows for individuals with existing genotypes to obtain fitness in novel conditions without adaptation occurring. Correlated trait evolution can encourage ecological fitting when direct selection on one trait causes a correlated change in another, potentially creating a phenotype that is pre-adapted to possible future conditions. Phylogenetic conservatism is the latent retention of genetic changes from past conditions: for instance, historical exposure to a certain host may predispose it to colonization in the future. Finally, fixed traits such as body size may lead to entirely different biotic interactions in different environments, e.g. pollinators visiting different sets of flowers.  Examples  Studies of introduced species can provide some of the best evidence for ecological fitting, because species invasions represent natural experiments testing how a new species fits into a community. Invasion ecology teaches us that changes in geographic range can occur quickly, as is required by the Janzen model for ecological fitting, and ecological fitting provides an important mechanism whereby new species can fit into an existing community without adaptation. These natural experiments have often shown that communities dominated by invasive species, such as those on Ascension Island, can be as diverse and complex as native communities. Additionally, phylogenetic studies show evidence for ecological fitting when lineages of the associated species do not correlate over evolutionary time; that is, if host- parasite or other interactions are as tightly coevolved as was previously believed, parasites should not be switching to unrelated hosts. This kind of host switching has been shown many times: in insect-plant relationships where oligophagy in locusts manifests itself on distantly related plants, plant- disperser relationships among Mediterranean birds, plant-pollinator relationships between hummingbirds and Heliconia flowers, and for parasite- host associations ranging from flatworms in frogs to parasitic worms in primates or in trout. Another study examined the time required for sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum, to accumulate diverse arthropod pest communities. It determined that time did not influence pest species richness, indicating that host-parasite associations were forming in ecological, not evolutionary, time. The human-made cloud forest on Green Mountain, Ascension Island represents an example of how unrelated and unassociated plant species can form a functioning ecosystem without a shared evolutionary history. 19th-century accounts of the island, including that of Charles Darwin on his expedition aboard the Beagle, described the rocky island as destitute and bare. Plants were brought to the island by colonists, but the most important change occurred in 1843 with the terraforming of Green Mountain by botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, who recommended planting trees on Green Mountain and vegetation on the slopes to encourage deeper soils. Plants were regularly sent from England until, in the 1920s, the mountain was green and verdant, and could be described as a functioning cloud forest. Although some of the species likely were introduced together because of their coevolutionary relationships, the overwhelming mechanism governing relationships is clearly ecological fitting. The system has changed dramatically and even provides ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, all as a result of ecological fitting. This is important in the light of climate change for two reasons: species ranges may be shifting dramatically, and ecological fitting is an important mechanism for the construction of communities over ecological time, and it shows that human-made systems could be integral in the mitigation of climate change.  Theoretical Applications  = Explaining Diversity Patterns = Ecological fitting can influence species diversity either by promoting diversification through genetic drift, or by maintaining evolutionary stasis through gene flow. Research has shown that ecological fitting can result in parasite assemblages that are just as diverse as those created over evolutionary time, indicating the importance of ecological factors for biodiversity. Ecological fitting can contribute to 3 types of evolutionary transition. The first is simple ecological fitting, in which organisms track resources to form novel species interactions and increase individual fitness. The second is a shift from an organism's ancestral ecology to a derived ecology, or a more true form of ecological fitting: traits are exapted from their original purpose to increase fitness. Finally, a more dramatic form involves the creation of new evolutionary arenas, requiring morphological or ecological changes to gain fitness under new conditions. Any of these processes can promote speciation or diversification under the right circumstances. Each form of ecological fitting can encourage speciation only if the population is sufficiently isolated from other populations to prevent gene flow from swamping local adaptation to newly formed species associations. Host-plant or other specialized relationships have been previously regarded as an evolutionary 'dead-end' because they seem to limit diversity, but they can actually promote it according to coevolutionary theory. Insects that feed on plants induce them to develop new defense mechanisms, which frees them from herbivory. In this new adaptive zone, or ecospace, plant clades can undergo evolutionary radiation, in which diversification of the clade occurs quickly due to adaptive change. The herbivorous insects may eventually succeed in adapting to the plants' defenses, and would also be capable of diversifying, in the absence of competition by other herbivorous insects. Thus, species associations can lead to rapid diversification of both lineages and contribute to overall community diversity. Ecological fitting can also maintain populations in stasis, influencing diversity by limiting it. If populations are well connected through gene flow, local adaptation may not be able to occur (known as antagonistic gene flow), or the well-connected population could evolve as a whole without speciation occurring. The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution theory can help to explain this: it suggests that coevolution or speciation of a species occurs across a wide geographic scale, rather than at the level of populations, so that populations experiencing selection for a particular trait affect gene frequencies across the geographic region due to gene flow. Populations of a species interact with different species in different parts of its range, so populations may be experiencing a small sub-set of the interactions to which the species as a whole is adapted. This is based on three premises: there is an environmental and biotic interaction mosaic affecting fitness in different areas, there are certain areas where species are more coevolved than others, and that there is mixing of allele frequencies and traits between the regions to create more homogeneous populations. Thus, depending on connectivity of populations and strength of selection pressure in different arenas, a widespread population can coevolve with another species, or individual populations can specialize, potentially resulting in diversification. = Community Assembly = Ecological fitting can explain aspects of species associations and community assembly, as well as invasion ecology. It is another mechanism, in addition to coevolution and in situ evolution (in which new phenotypes evolve and travel sympatrically), that can explain the creation and maintenance of species associations within a community. The phenomenon of ecological fitting helps to weigh in on some of the great debates in community ecology. The Clementisian school of community ecology, based on the work of Frederic Clements, a plant ecologist who studied ecological succession, holds that communities are constructed by deterministic processes that assemble a 'superorganism' from the individual species present. With the removal or exchange of a species, the community would be unstable. On the other hand, the Gleasonian view, promoted by Henry Gleason, who was also a plant ecologist studying successional communities, is more individualistic and emphasizes the role of random processes such as dispersal in community assembly. The Clementsian view would emphasize coevolution and strict niche fidelity as a major factor structuring communities, also known as the niche- assembly perspective, whereas the Gleasonian, or dispersal assembly view emphasizes neutral and historical processes, including ecological fitting. These views of community assembly raise the question: do species continue stable relationships over time, or do all individuals represent \\"asymmetrical pegs in square holes\\"? Some of these question can be answered through phylogenetic studies, which can determine when certain traits arose, and thus whether species interactions and community assembly occurs primarily through coevolution or through dispersal and ecological fitting. Support exists for each, indicating that each has a varied role to play, depending on the community and on historical factors. = Emerging Infectious Diseases = A field of recent importance for the application of ecological fitting is that of emerging infectious disease: infectious diseases that have emerged or increased incidence in the last 20 years, as a result of evolution, range expansion, or ecological changes. Climate change represents an ecological perturbation that induces range and phenological shifts in many species, which can encourage parasite transmission and host switching without any evolutionary change occurring. When species begin to infect host species with which they were not previously associated, it may be the result of ecological fitting. Even organisms with complex life histories can switch hosts as long as the resource required by each life stage is phylogenetically conserved and geographically widespread, meaning that it is difficult to predict based on life history complexity or other external factors. This has been used to explain the mysterious appearance of the bullfrog lung trematode Haematoloechus floedae in Costa Rican leopard frogs, even though bullfrogs do not and have never occurred in this area. When emerging infectious disease is the result of ecological fitting and host specificity is loose, then recurrent host shifts are likely to occur and the difficult task of building a predictive framework for management is necessary.

Chinese protesters had been demonstrating against Japan, boycotting Japanese products and attacking Japanese-owned businesses to show their support for the Chinese government. Cheng's post was actually a retweet of a post by her fianc√© Hua Chunhui who originally wrote: > ‚ÄúAnti-Japanese demonstrations, smashing Japanese products, that was all done > years ago by Guo Quan. So it‚Äôs no new trick. If you really wanted to kick it > up a notch, you‚Äôd immediately fly to Shanghai to smash the Japanese Expo > pavilion.‚Äù Cheng then added her three word comment, which both she and her fiance described as sarcastic satire, a joke criticizing the demonstrators. Arrest The comments made on October 17, 2010 were seen by the Chinese government as \\"disrupting public order\\", interpreted as attempting to incite anti-Japanese protesters to attack Japan's pavilion at the Shanghai Expo. Hua and Cheng were to be married on October 27, but before the ceremony, Cheng disappeared from the southeastern city of Wuxi. It was revealed the week of November 17 that she had been detained by police. Her fiance was also detained on October 27, and was released five days later. Cheng was sentenced on November 12 to one year of re-education through labor at the Shibalihe River women's labour camp in Zhengzhou city in Henan Province. Imprisonment Since the imprisonment Cheng has started a hunger strike protesting the sentence and seeking relocation closer to home. Her lawyer Lan Zhixue and her fiance have appealed the sentence. (Under China‚Äôs legal system, police can send people to re-education through labor for up to four years without trial. Few appeals are successful). International response The Chinese government's response brought attention to the risks of using Twitter for controversial political issues, as well as criticism from human rights and open technology groups. ‚ÄúSentencing someone to a year in a labor camp, without trial, for simply repeating another person‚Äôs clearly satirical observation on Twitter demonstrates the level of China‚Äôs repression of online expression,‚Äù said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International‚Äôs Director for the Asia-Pacific. The organization further commented, \\"Cheng may be the first Chinese citizen to become a prisoner of conscience on the basis of a single tweet.\\" Twitter CEO Dick Costolo posted to his Twitter account, \\"Dear Chinese Government, year- long detentions for sending a sarcastic tweet are neither the way forward nor the future of your great people.\\" Twitter is currently banned in China, but many people circumvent internet controls to use it. Support for other activists Amnesty International said Cheng had participated in low-level online activism, including sending online messages in support of jailed Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo. According to her fiance, Cheng's prior activism included signing petitions including one calling for the release of Liu Xiaobo. Cheng had also been detained by police for five days in August 2010 after voicing support for Liu Xianbin, a long-time democracy activist dating back to the protests that preceded the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Liu Xianbin had been detained in 2010, suspected of inciting subversion of state power for criticizing China's Communist Party. Cheng had also raised support for Zhao Lianhai, a former food safety worker who became an activist for parents of children harmed during the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. Chinese Human Rights Defenders described Cheng as an active participant in Weiguan tactics, bringing attention to government abuses by identifying officials by name, and putting pressure on them through protests and phone calls.

It is held about the second weekend in May. For 67 years, the meet was held at Modesto Junior College in Modesto, California, a track notable for tight turns and long straightaways, ending in 2008. During its run in Modesto, it was the site of over 30 world records.http://www.modestorelays.org/GeneralInfo/RelaysHistory/tabid/63/Default.aspx After taking the 2009 season off, the meet moved to Hughes Stadium at Sacramento City College in Sacramento, California.http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/display_article.php?id=29992 The meet director for most of that time was National Track and Field Hall of Fame member Tom Moore, a former elite hurdler from the University of California. As an athlete, Moore had tied the world record in the 120 yard high hurdles in 1935. Moore's name would become synonymous with the Modesto Relays. Moore served as the starter for the first meet for all but one race . . . the high hurdles, which he won. He had his running shorts on under his uniform and hastily changed to run. But Moore did almost everything else to make the meet what it became, from adjusting the lights toward the track (rather than just the football field) to obtaining sponsorship from S&W; Foods that brought notoriety to the otherwise sleepy Central Valley town. When S&W; dropped its sponsorship, Moore found a new sponsor in Coca-Cola. There are many quirky stories to the long history of the meet. \\"Dutch\\" Warmerdam set a world record in the pole vault, but only after the standards were repaired at the college welding shop. After the record, an excited official knocked over the standard again. When the bar was remeasured, Warmerdam lost 1/4 of an inch and a brawl ensued. The world record stood for 15 years. 58 years later, Stacy Dragila also set a world record in the pole vault at the meet. Double Olympic Gold medalist, Bob Richards negotiated a $75 cash bonus if he broke the meet record. When he arrived, he discovered the meet record was the world record, which Richards never achieved in his career. In 1961, when reigning Olympic Champion Herb Elliott dropped out of a heavily promoted Mile race with Dyrol Burleson (promoted as the cover story in Sports Illustrated),http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1028173/index.htm the packed stadium was silenced in disappointment.

It takes place in the Eberron campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Publication history Storm Dragon was written by James Wyatt and published in May 2008. This is the first novel of The Draconic Prophecies. Plot Gaven d'Lyrandar, his mind broken by the ancient Prophecy of the Dragons, has been rotting in Dreadhold for over twenty years. He is rescued by a band of adventurers loyal to Haldren, his only companion in his time at the terrible prison, but he begins to get the feeling that he is just a tool. A dragon named Vaskar has hired them to help him fulfill a prophecy and become the Storm Dragon. In exchange, he promises to grant Haldren the throne of a reunited Galifar. Gaven escapes and continues to run from the Sentinel Marshals, but along the way he discovers that he has the power of the Storm Dragon. Just as Haldren is gathering an army to stage a battle and fulfill another part of the prophecy, thus signaling \\"The sundering of the Soul Reaver's gates\\", Gaven begins heading towards the Soul Reaver, where he faces Vaskar and defeats him in battle, creating a spear from the Eye of Siberys (a dragonshard).

It began in 2003. As of 2009 the Gates Foundation had pledged to the programme. The programme aims to reduce HIV transmission and the prevalence of STIs in vulnerable high-risk populations, notably female sex workers, MSM, and transgender people, through prevention education and services such as condom promotion, STI management, behaviour change communication, community mobilisation, and advocacy. Avahan works in six states, whilst India HIV/AIDS Alliance is the state lead partner in Andhra Pradesh. Founding The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched Avahan in 2003 for the purpose of developing a model HIV prevention system in India and promoting others in India and worldwide to adapt and adopt their model. Strategy Rather than staffing HIV prevention workers on its own, Avahan provides government health organisations and NGOs with the tools they need to conduct HIV prevention on their own. Avahan's primary prevention techniques include the following: *training social workers to do peer education *funding sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment *distributing condoms *forcing communities who receive any aid to take total responsibility for the management of that aid *funding social media to reduce stigma associated with STIs *fostering access to HIV care and treatment Communication difficulty In 2005 an internal report determined that local people and even peer outreach workers had difficulty understanding the nature of Avahan's funded community partners. Specifically, local people had trouble understanding what services Avahan clinics and educators were offering. Impact In October 2011 a study published in The Lancet concluded that between 2003-8 in areas where the Avahan project was active the program lowered community rates of HIV acquisition with an increase in protection relative to increased funding per person.

The Socialist Party declared itself to be Marxist and independent of Soviet or Chinese influence, favoring popular anti-imperialist unity, directed by the working class, which would end domestic injustice and foreign intervention. The PS's basic ideas differed little from those of the left wing of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, or of the Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left, except that greater stress was placed on the proletariat's \\"directive\\" role, and on the word \\"Socialism\\" itself, by the Socialist Party. What the Socialist Party sought to offer that other parties perhaps could not was responsible leadership, prepared to act on declared principles rather than in the service of personal ambitions. Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, in particular, had established a deserved reputation for honesty and courage during the President Ren√© Barrientos years, when he had several times been arrested and imprisoned by the police. Having supported the left-wing regime of General Juan Jos√© Torres without being in the Government, the Socialist Party opposed the Hugo Banzer Su√°rez regime, and returned to the political scene in Bolivia only after Hugo Banzer's fall in 1978.Political parties of the Americas: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies.

In 2001 McBryde was first selected to represent Queensland in the men's lightweight four contesting the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He raced in further President's Cup lightweight fours for Queensland in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010. In 2010 he was also selected in the Queensland men's senior eights to contest the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. In 2004 he contested the Australian national lightweight pair title at the Australian Rowing Championships in Toowong Rowing Club colours. In 2007 he contested and won the national lightweight pair title racing for the QUBC and rowing with Todd Skipworth. International representative rowing McBryde made his Australian representative debut in a lightweight quad scull at the 2002 World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne. He then raced in that same quad that year at the World Rowing U23 Championships in Genoa to a gold medal. In 2003 he was elevated to the Australian senior lightweight squad. He competed in the lightweight quad at the 2003 World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne. Then at the 2003 World Rowing Championships in Milan he raced in the two seat of the quad scull to a silver medal.

It portrays a female nude pouring water from an urn while standing beside a small fawn. Description This cast bronze sculpture group measures 56 1/4\\" x 24\\" x 20\\", and it is patinated a smooth dark brown. The group features a classicizing female figure (the nymph) and a fawn (young deer, rather than the classical faun usually paired with nymphs). The nymph, coiffed with a vine and nude except for a thin band of cloth draped just below her hips, stands on her proper left leg and rests her folded right leg on a rock formation that reaches nearly as high as her hips. She leans far to her right, turning her torso just slightly downward. Her left arm crosses her body to stabilize and support a large urn resting horizontally on the rock, and her right elbow rests on the urn as she lightly supports her chin with her right hand. She peers downward at a small fawn standing below her in frontal alignment with the viewer. Its head and neck crane upward toward the urn, from which a small fountain of water trickles. The figures and rock formation are closely positioned on a small rectangular bronze base, and the sculpture itself sits on a limestone block. It is positioned at the edge of a small pond into which the urn's water flows. Historical information Nymph and Fawn is typical of the graceful, classical style of figuration that Isidore Konti became known for in the early 1900s. Based on a smaller, marble piece by the artist, it was originally the fountain's centerpiece. The sculpture was surveyed in 1988 as part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture inventory. =Location history= Nymph and Fawn is located near a pond that is part of the original Oldfields Ravine Garden, an informal garden that was designed by Percival Gallagher in 1920. This landscaping project was part of a larger effort by the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm to visually transform the Oldfields grounds at the time.Indianapolis Museum of Art. \\"Oldfields-Lilly House & Gardens\\", Explore Art: IMA Collections.

Its features and plantings were rehabilitated and restored through careful research during the 1990s. =Acquisition= The sculpture was acquired by the IMA as a gift by Mr. and Mrs. John J. Weldon in 1977. Artist Isidore Konti was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1862. Beginning at the age of sixteen, he studied art at the Vienna Academy under Edmund von Hellmer, and later continued training at the Meisterschule under Carl Kundmann until 1886.Collecting Sculpture. Fall 2001. New York: John Graham & Sons, Inc., 2001. 17. In the early 1890s, Konti emigrated to the United States and immediately began work in Chicago for the 1893 Columbian Exposition. From there he moved to New York City where he worked as a studio assistant for Karl Bitters and eventually opened his own studio. By the early 1900s, Konti had established his reputation in the U.S. as an expert modeler through participation in several national expositions. His lyrical, decorative style was well-suited to architectural and sculptural commissions. See also *List of Indianapolis Museum of Art artworks *Save Outdoor Sculpture!

The house was originally constructed about 1830 by local farmer Emmanuel DeHodiamont and was modified into the Gothic Revival style about 1875. It shares the status of being the oldest extant residence in the city of St. Louis with the Lewis Bissell House, and it is the oldest privately owned building in St. Louis. It was listed as a St. Louis Landmark in 1966 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 2002. History Emmanuel DeHodiamont and his wife Caroline purchased a 180-acre tract of land including parts of the River Des Peres in 1829 from Hypoline and Josephine Papin. No permits exist to date the original construction, but it is considered likely DeHodiamont built the structure soon after the purchase.According to the NRHP Registration Form, no improvements existed on the land when it was purchased, but improvements were listed when DeHodiamont borrowed money against the farm in 1835. Shortly after moving into the house, DeHodiamont's wife died, and he remarried in 1833. However, his new wife abandoned him in 1836, and he divorced her. He continued to farm the land until 1871, when he sold the house and remaining nearby property to land speculators. These speculators anticipated the construction of a railroad from St. Louis, which occurred in 1875. By that time, the house and its 57 acres were platted into a parcel called Maryville. It was likely at this time that the current Gothic Revival architecture was added. Construction of homes in the new subdivision was relatively slow until the 1890s, when most of the land was sold and developed. Houses that surround the DeHodiamont House date from this period and to the 1960s, when many of the circa 1890s houses were demolished and redeveloped. Architecture Emmanuel DeHodiamont House The portion of the house dating to 1830 is a -story stone house, measuring 20 by 40 feet. The stone walls are nearly two feet thick, and the house retains its two original chimneys at the south and north ends of the house. The second story of the house is wood framed, and the center of the house has a high- pitched gable, both dating to the 1875 addition. The door placement and window placement on the first floor are original to the 1830 plans of the house. In 1890 and 1906, brick kitchen additions were made to the rear of the house. The first floor interior of the house has two nearly identical rooms, divided by a central corridor with a staircase. The north room opens into the kitchen at the rear. The second floor has two bedrooms, both nearly identical. In the back yard of the house stands a brick garage built in 1904, which is a contributing resource to the house listing. Significance The house has the dual significance of being an \\"exceptionally early stone house\\" and a \\"rare example of the early Gothic Revival style in St. Louis.\\" Although a great number of stone houses were built in the St. Louis area prior to the 1850s, most of these were demolished as the commercial district of the original city expanded. Not only is the DeHodiamont House an early stone house, but it also is one of the earliest known houses to still exist in the St. Louis. It is also listed as a St. Louis City Landmark.

The user interface that is used to do so is called a web browser. A central theme in web design is the development of a web navigation interface that maximizes usability. A website overall navigational scheme includes several navigational pieces such as global, local, supplemental, and contextual navigation; all of these are vital aspects of the broad topic of web navigation. Hierarchical navigation systems are vital as well since it is the primary navigation system. It allows for the user to navigate within the site using levels alone, which is often seen as restricting and requires additional navigation systems to better structure the website. The global navigation of a website, as another segment of web navigation, serves as the outline and template in order to achieve an easy maneuver for the users accessing the site, while local navigation is often used to help the users within a specific section of the site. All these navigational pieces fall under the categories of various types of web navigation, allowing for further development and for more efficient experiences upon visiting a webpage. History Web navigation came about with the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1989, when Timothy Berners-Lee invented it. Once the world wide web was available, web navigation increasingly became a major aspect and role in jobs and everyday lives. With one-third of the world‚Äôs population now using the internet, web navigation maintains a global use in today's ever evolving international society. Web navigation is not restricted to just computers, either, as mobile phones and tablets have added avenues for access to the ever-growing information on the web today. The most recent wave of technology which has affected web navigation is the introduction and growth of the smartphone. As of January 2014, 58% of American adults owned a smart phone, and that number is on the rise from previous years. Web navigation has evolved from a restricted action, to something that many people across the world now do on a daily basis. Types of web navigation The use of website navigation tools allow for a website's visitors to experience the site with the most efficiency and the least incompetence. A website navigation system is analogous to a road map which enables webpage visitors to explore and discover different areas and information contained within the website. There are many different types of website navigation: =Hierarchical website navigation= The structure of the website navigation is built from general to specific. This provides a clear, simple path to all the web pages from anywhere on the website. =Global website navigation= Global website navigation shows the top level sections/pages of the website. It is available on each page and lists the main content sections/pages of the website. =Local website navigation= Local navigation is the links within the text of a given web page, linking to other pages within the website. Styles of web navigation Web navigations vary in styles between different website as well as within a certain site. The availability of different navigational styles allows for the information in the website to be delivered easily and directly. This also differentiates between categories and the sites themselves to indicate what the vital information is and to enable the users access to more information and facts discussed within the website. Across the globe, different cultures prefer certain styles for web navigations, allowing for a more enjoyable and functional experience as navigational styles expand and differentiate *Navigation bar: A navigation bar or (navigation system) is a section of a website or online page intended to aid visitors in travelling through the online document. *Sitemap: A site map (or sitemap) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a Web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion. *Dropdown menu: In computing with graphical user interfaces, a dropdown menu or drop-down menu or drop-down list is a user interface control GUI element (\\"widget\\" or \\"control\\"), similar to a list box, which allows the user to choose one value from a list. *Flyout menu: In computing with graphical user interfaces, a menu that flies out (either down or to the side) when you click or hover (mouseover) some GUI element. *Named anchor: An anchor element is called an anchor because web designers can use it to anchor a URL to some text on a web page. When users view the web page in a browser, they can click the text to activate the link and visit the page whose URL is in the link.HTML 4 for dummies, 5th edition, 2005, By Ed Tittel, Mary C. Burmeister, p. 96. Design of web navigation What makes Web design navigation difficult to work with is that it can be so versatile. Navigation varies in design through the presence of a few main pages in comparison to multi-level architecture. Content can also vary between logged-in users and logged-out users and more. Because navigation has so many differences between websites, there are no set guidelines or to-do lists for organizing navigation. Designing navigation is all about using good information architecture, and expressing the model or concept of information used in activities requiring explicit details of complex systems. Future of web navigation =Adaptive website navigation= Adaptive web navigation describes the process of real-time changes in a website's navigation links and layout according to individual user preferences as they browse the site. Innovative websites are increasingly attempting to automatically personalize web sites based on a user‚Äôs browsing pattern in order to find relevant information more quickly and efficiently. The usage of data analysis allows website creators to track behavior patterns of a user as they navigate a site. Adding shortcut links between two pages, rearranging list items on a page, and omitting irrelevant navigation links are all examples of adaptive changes that can be implemented in real-time. The advantage of utilizing adaptive technologies in web navigation is it reduces the time and navigational effort required for users to find information. A possible disadvantage of this is that users may get disoriented from global and local navigational changes from page to page.

In spite of their past correspondence Lihn does not acknowledge knowing the narrator when they are introduced, and the narrator also pretends that they are not acquainted. Later on Lihn suddenly realizes that he is dead, and the narrator leaves him. Out on the street he runs into someone he doesn't know who confuses him with someone else, and Bola√±o plays along. The man soon realizes his mistake, but then proceeds to play along himself, pretending that he knows Bola√±o. Both are aware of the game, and Bola√±o constructs a whole story regarding the man, whom he calls Jara, and his supposed life. Bola√±o returns to Lihn and they go to his surreal apartment, which seems to have a glass floor and constantly changes in structure and appearance. They eventually return to the bar where Lihn tells him that \\"The tigers are finished, and, It was sweet while it lasted, and, You‚Äôre not going to believe this, Bola√±o, but in this neighborhood only the dead go out for a walk.\\"Bola√±o, Roberto. \\"Meeting with Enrique Lihn\\", The New Yorker, December 22, 2008.

In 1914 it flew with a more powerful engine and other modifications as the Perry Beadle T.2, which was acquired by the Royal Navy Air Service at the outbreak of World War I. Design and development Perry, Beadle & Co. was formed by E.W. Copland Berry, a pilot, and F.P. Hyde Beadle, a technician, who were at the Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough together in 1912. Their first product was the 1913 T.1, a single- seat tractor biplane modified the following year into the more powerful T.2. The T.1 and T.2 are the only Perry Beadle types known to have flown. The T.1 was a biplane with wings of equal span, constant chord and no stagger or sweep. It had an essentially two bay wing structure, though a third set of simple parallel interplane struts on each wing, close to the fuselage, took the place of cabane struts. Parallel chord ailerons were fitted only to the upper wing. The fuselage was mounted between the wings, with gaps both above and below; the interplane gap was wide at about 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m). The fuselage was flat sided and tapered to the tail, but had a curved decking which sloped down both fore and aft from the under wing cockpit. This improved the pilot's forward view; a cut-out in the trailing edge of the upper wing aided his upward vision. At the rear, the T.1 had a conventional tailplane and elevators but there was no fixed fin, only a deep rudder which ran between and well below the elevators to the struts that also carried the tail skid. The main wheels were sprung on a pair of forward skids. In the nose a 25 hp (19 kW) inverted Y Anzani 3-cylinder engine drove a two-bladed propeller. The T.1 was built and flown at Beaulieu, Hampshire in 1913, with at least one flight from there to Cowes, a distance of about 8 miles (13 km). In the following May a more powerful version with increased wing area and smaller interplane gap came to Brooklands, designated the T.2. The extra power came from a 6-cylinder, two row Anzani 6 radial which produced 45 hp (34 kW). The extra wing area was achieved by extending the upper wing by about 5 ft (1.5 m) on each side, the overhang braced by extra pairs of outward leaning struts. The ailerons were now tapered. The interplane gap was decreased to 4 ft 9 in (1.45 m) by attaching the lower wing to the bottom of the fuselage. The undercarriage was simplified by removing the skids, leaving a simple single axle supported by pairs of inverted V struts. The T.2 flew from Brooklands on 26 June 1914, piloted by Copland Berry. It was later flown by others and, when war began, was requisitioned into the RNAS with serial 1322. It was destroyed at Hendon the following March.

Commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications, it was published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton on 26 May 2011 and was released in the United States by Simon & Schuster on 14 June 2011. Carte Blanche is the thirty-seventh original James Bond novel and the first to have a contemporary setting since The Man with the Red Tattoo by Raymond Benson was published in 2002. The title and cover artwork were unveiled on 17 January 2011, at a special launch event at the InterContinental Hotel in Dubai. Background Carte Blanche updates James Bond's backstory to fit with the 21st century setting. Jeffery Deaver has stated that his James Bond will have been born in 1979, making him a veteran of the war in Afghanistan (Operation Herrick) instead of a World War II veteran and Cold War secret agent as originally conceived by creator Ian Fleming. Plot Set in mid-2011, the story takes place over the course of a week. James Bond is a former Royal Naval Reserve officer who has recently joined the Overseas Development Group ‚Äì a covert operational unit of British security under the control of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office tasked \\"to identify and eliminate threats to the country by extraordinary means.\\" Bond is employed within the 00 Section of the Operations Branch. He starts his assignment on the outskirts of Novi Sad in Serbia where an Irish sapper- turned-enforcer named Niall Dunne is planning to derail a train carrying three hundred kilograms of methyl isocyanate, dumping it into the Danube. Bond is able to prevent the catastrophe by derailing the train himself at a much safer place along the line. He is unable to detain Dunne, who kills Bond's Serbian contacts in the course of his escape. Using what little intelligence Bond was able to gather from the operation in Serbia, the ODG is able to establish a connection to Green Way International, a waste disposal consortium contracted to demolish an army base in March. Because Bond is not authorized to act on British soil, he is forced to work with a domestic security agent named Percy Osborne-Smith. The two men clash over the interpretation of the intelligence, prompting Bond to manipulate Osborne-Smith into pursuing a lead Bond knows to be false, and allowing him to investigate the March army base on his own. While exploring the base hospital, he is sealed inside by Niall Dunne, who intends to kill him by bringing the hospital down in a controlled demolition. Bond escapes by improvising an explosive device. Bond turns his attention to Green Way International, led by the enigmatic Severan Hydt. The Dutch-born Hydt is a \\"rag-and-bone man\\", who made his fortune in the disposal of waste. He has an intense fascination with death, which is strongly implied to be a sexual fetish. The Overseas Development Group authorize Bond to investigate Hydt when intelligence surfaces suggesting he is also known as 'Noah' and a key player in the derailment in Serbia, which is believed to be a prelude to a much bigger attack that will affect British interests. Bond gets wind of a second attack, to occur later in the week, killing up to one hundred people. He tracks Hydt to Dubai and, with the help of CIA officer Felix Leiter, eavesdrops on a conversation with one of Hydt's senior researchers. Concerned that the attack is imminent, Bond attempts to anticipate Hydt's next move and is on the verge of evacuating a crowded museum when he realises that Hydt is there for an exhibit of the bodies of ninety tribal nomads who were killed a millennium ago. Aborting his planned evacuation, Bond returns to Hydt's facility to find that Leiter has been attacked by an unknown assailant and a local CIA asset has been murdered. Hydt leaves Dubai for Cape Town, with Bond following closely. Once inside South Africa, he meets Bheka Jordaan, a local police operative. Bond is able to get close to Hydt by posing as a Durban- based mercenary, and fuels Hydt's fixation with death by promising him access to mass graves across the African continent. Hydt is taken by Bond's proposal of exhuming the bodies and recycling them into consumer products such as building materials, and gradually welcomes him into his inner circle. Bond attends a fundraiser for the International Organization Against Hunger with Hydt, where he meets Felicity Willing, the charity's spokesperson. After helping Willing deliver the left-over food from the fundraiser to a distribution centre, the two begin a relationship. Using his cover, Bond is able to infiltrate Hydt's operations in South Africa. His relationship with Bheka Jordaan sours, particularly when he encounters the assailant who attacked Felix Leiter in Dubai: the brother of one of his contacts who was killed in Serbia. As the deadline for the attack ‚Äì known as Gehenna (derived from the Hebrew word for Hell) ‚Äì approaches, the Overseas Development Group is ordered to pull Bond out of South Africa and send him to Afghanistan as Whitehall believes the attack will happen there as they can see no connection between Hydt and Gehenna. M is not convinced and manages to keep Bond in South Africa, but the future of the agency depends on his being correct in suspecting Hydt. On the day of the Gehenna attacks, Bond deduces that the target is somewhere in York, but his report is ignored by Osborne-Smith, who believes it is aimed at a security conference in London. Bond manages to access Hydt's research and development facility, where he uncovers plans for a weapon developed by Serbia known as \\"the Cutter\\", which fires razor-sharp shards of titanium at hypervelocity. Hydt has been using his operations to steal sensitive information, from which he has acquired the blueprints to the Cutter. Bond realised that the derailment in Serbia was a false flag operation: its intention was not to drop methyl isocyanate into the Danube, but to allow Niall Dunne the opportunity to steal scrap metal from the train for use in the prototype Cutter. Hydt was employed by an American pharmaceutical corporation to detonate a Cutter at a university in York, killing a cancer researcher on the verge of a breakthrough that would bankrupt the pharmaceutical corporation. Misinformation fed to a Hungarian newspaper would suggest the attack was aimed at a fellow lecturer who was a vocal opponent of the Serbian government. With the help of Hydt's personal assistant, Bond is able to stop the attack. Hydt is arrested, but Dunne escapes and shoots his employer at long range. Bond is uncomfortable with the conclusion, feeling that there are too many loose ends at hand. Research shows that the ODG had been misled, and their intelligence misinterpreted; Severan Hydt was never known as Noah. Rather, it is an acronym for the National Organisation Against Hunger, which recently expanded to provide food aid on an international scale. Niall Dunne is an associate of Felicity Willing, whose organisation has expanded to the point where she directly controls one-third of all food aid arriving in Africa. She intends to use this power to strategically distribute food throughout east Africa, giving the Sudanese government a pretext to go to war with rebels and prevent Southern Sudan from seceding. She set Dunne up in Hydt's organization so he could help her put the authorities on his trail, providing the distraction she needed to put her plan into action. Bond lures Willing into a trap at an abandoned inn where she confesses the plot. Niall Dunne re-appears, attacking the party before Bond and Bheka Jordaan shoot and kill him. Willing is taken to a black site after MI6 spread stories suggesting she was embezzling from her own charity. A subplot throughout the novel involves Bond's investigations into a KGB operation code-named \\"Steel Cartridge\\". Bond believes that his father was a spy for the United Kingdom during the Cold War, and that he was killed by Russian agents. Further evidence suggests that Steel Cartridge was a clean-up operation, with the Russians assassinating their own agents that had infiltrated Western intelligence organisations. The suggestion that his father was a traitor does not sit well with Bond, until he unearths further evidence that shows the Russians carried out a Steel Cartridge assassination on a Western spy-hunter who was dangerously close to identifying Soviet moles ‚Äì his mother, Monique Delacroix Bond. Characters Carte Blanche features several recurring characters from the Fleming novels, however, they all have updated backstories in order to fit in with the contemporary setting: * James Bond: Born in 1979, Bond is a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan (Operation Herrick). He drives a Bentley Continental GT, a brand Fleming used throughout his novels. Unlike the Fleming character (and despite the book's smoke design motif), James Bond is a former smoker. * M: The head of the Overseas Development Group returned to being a man after being a woman (Barbara Mawdsley) throughout Raymond Benson‚Äôs tenure. He is referred to as \\"Miles\\" by two intelligence officers, implying that he is Miles Messervy, as Fleming identified M in his novels. * Severan Hydt: The Dutch-born owner of Green Way International, a waste disposal corporation. He has an obsession with death that borders on sexual fetishisation, and plans to detonate a dangerous weapon in a British university to kill a cancer researcher. * Niall Dunne: A former Army sapper turned enforcer who serves as Hydt's trusted confidant and the brains behind his plan. From Belfast, he has a fascination with machines, and tends to view the world in a cool, dispassionate manner. * Felicity Willing: The spokeswoman for the International Organisation Against Hunger, which controls one-third of all food aid arriving in Africa. Willing attempts to use her position to distribute food in a way that would give the Sudanese government a pretext to go to war with rebels in the south. * Bheka Jordaan: A member of the South African Police Service and an ally of Bond's. She is aware of the nature of his work and refuses to take part in it unless Bond can give her a legal reason to intervene. Her stubborn insistence on obeying protocol stems from a high-profile investigation she conducted into corruption in the South African police forces. * Jessica Barnes: Hydt head of PR and Advertising. Also his lover, an older woman, he has a fascination with her ageing. * Miss Moneypenny: M's personal secretary is in her mid-30s. * Ophelia \\"Philly\\" Maidenstone: MI6's liaison officer to the Overseas Development Group. Bond finds her invaluable, particularly for her ability to piece together intelligence. He finds they share many common interests, and considers pursuing a relationship with her, once he has allowed her time to recover from a broken engagement. * Gregory Lamb: An MI6 officer stationed in Cape Town, but with jurisdiction over the entire African continent. Many in London consider him dangerous and unbridled and advise that he should be avoided if possible. Lamb ingratiates himself into Bond's operation, and Bond surmises that he is less dangerous than he is cowardly. * Percy Osborne-Smith: An agent with Division Three, an offshoot of MI5. Osborne-Smith likes to be the one leading investigations so that he may take the credit for a successful operation. His ambitions lead him to shut down central London at the height of a security conference, ignoring intelligence from Bond that suggests the attack will take place in York. * Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA counterpart and ally who aids him in tracking Severan Hydt in Dubai. * Nicholas Rathko: A Serbian operative and former member of Arkhan's Tigers with a vendetta against Bond. His younger brother was assisting Bond in Serbia before being captured and tortured by Niall Dunne. Rathko wants revenge against Bond for leaving his brother to die while chasing Dunne rather than taking him to a hospital. * Sanu Hirani: The head of the Overseas Development Group's Q Branch. He is able to rapidly improvise and modify field equipment for Bond (at the drop of a hat) and claims he does not need to sleep. His office is described as being plastered with pictures of Indian cricketers. The novel refers to this character as \\"Q\\" at least once, implying that in Deaver's continuity Major Boothroyd (the Q of Fleming's Bond) is not the quartermaster of Q Branch. This is the only case of an ongoing Fleming character being replaced by Deaver. * Mary Goodnight: The secretary to the 00 Section will be 21 years old. Goodnight has not been featured in a Bond novel since Fleming's The Man with the Golden Gun (1965); she had references in several previous Fleming novels. In the book, Deaver indicates that Goodnight resembles actress Kate Winslet. * May Maxwell: Bond's loyal and elderly Scottish housekeeper. Initial reports suggested she would be re-imagined as Indian or Pakistani maidservant, but this change was later applied to Sanu Hirani, the head of Q Branch. The last name \\"Maxwell\\" is newly established, as Fleming never assigned a last name to the character. Launch event As many details as possible regarding James Bond's adventures in Carte Blanche were kept under wraps by Ian Fleming Publications. The buzz generated around the book culminated in an invite-only event at St. Pancras Station in London on 25 May 2011. Here Deaver made his grand entrance in a Carte Blanche labelled Bentley, accompanied by stunt woman, model and actress Chesca Miles. Royal Marine Commandos abseiled from the roof of the elaborate station to hand Deaver a copy of the novel as he unveiled the book to the world's press.

Early life Allt is an eldest child from a family of five; his father worked as a union shop steward in a number of factories and his mother as a union rep, dinner lady. From 1965-72, he went to St. Mary's Roman Catholic Infant and Junior Schools in Kirkby. From 1972 onward, he attended St Kevin's Comprehensive in Kirkby till 1977 (which became All Saints Catholic High School, Kirkby). He has lived a nomadic lifestyle, emigrating to South Africa and America, and living and working, at various building trades, in London, Jersey, Bournemouth, Germany and Spain, and numerous other cities around the globe. Career His first success came as the writer of The Boys from the Mersey, a bestselling book about his travels while following Liverpool Football Club. His next book, Here We Go Gathering Cups in May was written with six other authors about Liverpool FC's seven European Cup Final appearances.http://textpublishing.com.au/books-and- authors/author/nicky-allt Allt's first play, \\"Brick Up the Mersey Tunnels\\", co-written, became a huge local hit at Liverpool's Royal Court Theatre. The play, about a comedic rivalry between The Wirral and Liverpool, which ends in the surreal blockading of the Mersey Tunnels, to stop the 'posh Wirraliens' from getting through to take up Liverpool jobs, was eventually watched by over 180,000 people. In Liverpool Theatre folklore, it was stated that it saved the historic Royal Court Theatre from closing. The play went on to complete four sell-out runs at the Theatre. Allt's next venture into theatre was to write and produce the hit show, \\"One Night in Istanbul\\", which became The Empire Theatre's fastest selling show, after being watched by 25,000 people in a short run in the spring of 2009. The show had repeated success at The Liverpool Empire, and at the brand new Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin's docklands. It is now being made into a movie. Allt's first Independent feature film \\"One Night in Istanbul\\" starring Sam Janus, Paul Barber and Steve Waddington will be released in 2014, along with a new comedy play \\"A Tale of Two Chippy's\\" about two warring North West fish and chip shops, and a new movie about ex Prime Minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Allt lives in Liverpool with his wife and three children and has just written and produced a show about the history of Liverpool Football Club called You'll Never Walk Alone that received rave reviews, and is in the process of writing a movie about New York and Ireland. He is also the author of huge hit show \\"Celtic the Musical\\" which sold out at Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre in 2016 and 2018.

Biography A native of Barcelona,Page 559: Mas-Colell completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Barcelona, earning a degree in economics in 1966. He moved to the University of Minnesota for his graduate studies, and completed his Ph.D. in 1972 under the supervision of Marcel Richter.. He took a faculty position in mathematics and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, becoming a full professor in 1979. In 1981, he moved to Harvard University, and in 1988 he became the Louis Berkman Professor of Economics at Harvard. In 1995 he moved to Pompeu Fabra to lead the Department of Economics and Business. He was editor-in-chief of the Journal of Mathematical Economics from 1985 to 1989, and of Econometrica from 1988 to 1998. He was president of the Econometric Society in 1993 and of the European Economic Association in 2006. In public service, Mas-Colell was the Commissioner for Universities and Research of the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1999‚Äì2000. While Minister of Universities, Research and the Information Society for the Generalitat from 2000 to 2003, Mas-Colell implemented a research institution called Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) Page 1431: to attract top-notch scientists in all fields of knowledge, from philosophers to astrophysicists, to perform their research in 50 different host institutions in Catalonia. Mas- Colell served the Secretary General of the European Research Council from 2009 to 2010. In the Catalonia Government from 2010-2016, presided by Artur Mas, he was appointed as the Minister for Economy and Knowledge, being responsible for the government's budget, economic policy, and research policy. Research Mas-Colell's research has ranged broadly over mathematical economics. In particular, he has been associated with a revival of the use of differential calculus (in the form of \\"global analysis\\") at the highest levels of mathematical economics. Following John von Neumann's break-throughs in economics, and particularly after his introduction of functional analysis and topology into economic theory, advanced mathematical economics reduced its emphasis on differential calculus. In general equilibrium theory, mathematical economists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than differential calculus.G√©rard Debreu The Theory of Value: An axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium, 1959 In the 1960s and 1970s, however, G√©rard Debreu and Stephen Smale led a revival of the use of differential calculus in mathematical economics. In particular, they were able to prove the existence of a general equilibrium, where earlier writers had failed, through the use of their novel mathematics: Baire category from general topology and Sard's lemma from differential topology and differential geometry. Their publications initiated a period of research \\"characterized by the use of elementary differential topology\\": \\"almost every area in economic theory where the differential approach has been pursued, including general equilibrium\\" was covered by Mas-Colell's monograph on differentiable analysis and economics. Mas-Colell's book \\"offers a synthetic and thorough account of a major recent development in general equilibrium analysis, namely, the largely successful reconstruction of the theory using modern ideas of differential topology\\", according to its back cover. Mas-Colell has also contributed to the theory of general equilibrium in topological vector lattices. The sets of prices and quantities can be described as partially ordered vector spaces, often as vector lattices. Economies with uncertain or dynamic decisions typically require that the vector spaces be infinite-dimensional, in which case the order properties of vector lattices allow stronger conclusions to be made. Recently researchers have studied nonlinear pricing: A \\"main motivation came from the fact that Mas-Colell's fundamental theory of welfare economics with no interiority assumptions crucially requires lattice properties of commodity spaces, even in finite-dimensional settings.\\"Page 503 (Chapter 8 \\"Applications to economics\\", especially Section 8.5. \\"Pareto optimality in ordered commodity spaces\\", and the remainder of the chapter, particularly Section 8.5.11 \\"Nonlinear pricing\\") =Books= Mas-Colell is the author or co-author of: *The Theory of General Economic Equilibrium: a Differentiable Approach (Econometric Society Monographs in Pure Theory 9, Cambridge University Press, 1990, ). This book was evaluated for Mathematical Reviews by Dave Furth, who wrote that ::Mas- Colell's book is one of the first and still one of the most complete and most rigorous of the few textbooks on the applications of differential topology and global analysis to the theory of general economic equilibrium. .... People working in the field ought to own and to have used it already for some time. So those still wanting to consult for the first time and perhaps wanting to buy the book must be mathematicians interested in economic applications of the above-mentioned mathematical subjects. They will not regret consulting and/or buying it; the book is excellent.. *Microeconomic Theory (with Michael Dennis Whinston, Jerry R. Green, Oxford University Press, 1995, ). writes that this \\"is the most commonly used textbook in microeconomics\\". * Awards and honors Mas-Colell is a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a foreign honorary member of the American Economic Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Academia Europaea, a member of the Institute of Catalan Studies, a fellow of the Real Academia de Ciencias Morales y Pol√≠ticas, and a fellow of the Econometric Society.

Description The standard method for carrying out executions was hanging, sometimes of several convicts at the same time. Mandatory death penalty for murder was abolished in 1935. At the same time, criminal justice saw an increased racialisation in disfavour of the non-white majority, who represented the vast majority of accused and convicted in capital cases. Hanging was maintained following the instatement of a republic in 1961. At approximately the same time South Africa saw mounting international criticism against purposely political executions of anti-apartheid activists convicted of violent crimes, mainly of blacks, but in some cases of whites, such as Frederick John Harris in 1965. The 1980s saw a rapid increase in the number of executions; 164 in 1987 alone (an official tally higher than that of any other country, including the People's Republic of China and Iran). Since 1959, the South African government officially performed 2,949 hangings (14 of women), including 1,123 in the 1980s. Out of more than one hundred South Africans executed in 1988, only three were white. Despite the grim statistics, not all capital cases ended with execution; of 83 black South Africans convicted of killing whites between June 1982 and June 1983 some 38 were hanged, as well as one white convicted of killing a white (out of 52). Executions were carried out in Pretoria Central Prison; condemned prisoners were held in a section of the prison called \\"The Pot\\". The last execution carried out by the South African government was the hanging of Solomon Ngobeni in November 1989. The last woman executed was Sandra Smith on 2 June the same year along with her boyfriend Yassiem Harris, in all cases following a murder conviction. In February 1990, a moratorium was declared by President De Klerk. Two further executions were, however, carried out in the nominally independent \\"homelands\\" of Boputhatswana and Venda in 1990 and 1991 respectively. Although the death penalty was abolished in 1995, opinion polls suggest significant public support for its reinstatement. A 2014 poll in South Africa found that 76 percent of millennium generation South Africans support re-introduction of the death penalty. Current situation There are a number of parties in South Africa that currently support the return of the death penalty. They are the National Party South Africa, the African Christian Democratic Party, African Covenant,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2019-03-22-the-crib-sheet-to- the-political-parties-contesting-the-2019-polls-part-one/ the African Transformation Movement (ATM)New political party officially launched in the Eastern Cape. Retrieved on 21 January 2019. and the National Conservative Party of South Africa. 2018 saw growing calls for the return of the death penalty. On 20 July the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) stated that the time had come to discuss the possibility of reinstating the death penalty in South Africa,https://www.thesouthafrican.com/should-sa-bring-back-the-death-penalty- ifp-believes-it-may-be-time/https://citizen.co.za/news/south- africa/1984017/lets-talk-about-bringing-back-the-death-penalty-says-ifp// and on 8 August the National Freedom Party called for the restoration of the death penalty in South Africa after the death of Khensani Maseko, in a call similar to that of the IFP weeks before. In April 2020, former EFF Gauteng chairperson Mandisa Mashego announced that she supports the reinstatement of the death penalty in South Africa.

Ruddick (1912-1988) was an Afro-Canadian miner and a survivor of the 1958 Springhill Mining Disaster, an underground earthquake, or \\"bump\\" as the miners call it, in the Springhill mine in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. He was chosen as Canada's \\"Citizen of the Year\\". Ruddick and six others were trapped 4000 feet underground, and were there for nine days. Ruddick cheered his comrades with his singing, and the mother of one of the miners later declared \\"If it wasn't for Maurice, they'd all have been dead.\\" The disaster attracted international media attention. The Governor of the State of Georgia, Marvin Griffin, invited nineteen of the survivors to vacation at one of his state's luxurious resorts, Jekyll Island, usually reserved for millionaires. This was in the Deep South in the time of Jim Crow laws, i.e. strict segregation between black and white people. When he discovered that one of the miners was black, Griffin said that Ruddick would have to be segregated from the others. When the miners heard this, they were reluctant to accept the offer, but Ruddick agreed to go on the Governor's terms, knowing how much the others really wanted the vacation. Ruddick, his wife, and the four of his twelve children who accompanied him on the trip all stayed in a separate area of the island, in trailers built by Griffin especially for the occasion, and attended separate ceremonies from the white miners. Maurice Ruddick died in 1988. He is buried in Hillside Cemetery. His daughter, folk singer Val MacDonald, recorded a song that he composed in the mine, \\"The Springhill Mine Disaster Song.\\" He was featured in a Canadian Heritage Minute.

It was a single- engined, single-seat biplane intended to operate from the Imperial Japanese Navy's aircraft carriers, but only two were built, with the type being rejected by the Navy. Design and development The standard carrier-based fighter of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1926 was the Mitsubishi 1MF or Navy Type 10 Carrier Type Fighter, designed in 1921 by the ex-Sopwith British designer Herbert Smith.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p. 161. In April that year, a specification was issued to Mitsubishi, Aichi and Nakajima for a replacement for the Type 10, requiring the aircraft to stay afloat in the event of ditching in the sea. Mitsubishi gave the task of designing the new fighter to Joji Hattori, who had worked with Smith on the design of the Type 10. The resultant aircraft, the Experimental Taka-type (Falcon) fighter or 1MF9, was a single-bay biplane of wooden construction with fabric covering. It had a watertight fuselage and jettisonable fixed conventional landing gear to meet the Navy's ditching requirements (jettisonable because aircraft with fixed landing gear are very dangerous to land on water, since the drag from the water can easily flip the aircraft over when the wheels touch the surface), and was powered by a Mitsubishi Hi V-12 (licence-built Hispano-Suiza Lb). The pilot sat in an open cockpit, armed with two synchronised machine guns. Operational history The first of two prototypes flew in July 1927, being the first Japanese designed carrier-based fighter to fly, with the second following in September. It was not successful, with the design proposed by Nakajima, a modified version of the British Gloster Gamecock fighter being chosen for production as the Nakajima A1N, despite the fact that Nakajima and Gloster had chosen to ignore the requirement for easy ditching, allowing a lighter and more manoeuvrable aircraft.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p224.

Siraud, L. Lacomme, Dictionnaire des lieux habit√©s du d√©partement de Sa√¥ne-et-Loire1892:41) that does not figure in William Smith and Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines. The breed has origins dating back to at least the 16th century, but was nearly extinct by the end of World War II. Through the efforts of Father Robert Billard, the breed was resurrected during the second half of the 20th century; its national breed club was founded in 1990. The breed was recognised by the Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) in 2003. History The history of this breed can be traced to the 16th century, however by the mid 20th century it had nearly become extinct. Following World War II, Robert Billard, a priest, was given a parish in Sa√¥ne-et-Loire in the Bresse region of France. Billard was an active hunter and began to search for a suitable hunting dog. He was told of a local dog breed known as the \\"Epagneul de Saint-Usuge\\", and contacted the Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine in order to find what happened to the breed. Father Billard found that the last recording of the Saint-Usuge Spaniel was in a dog show in 1936 in the nearby town of Louhans, and he located the breed standard from that show. He proceeded to visit the hunters in his parish until he found a dog which matched the breed description, a female named Poupette. In 1950 he found a male spaniel named Dick, who was a son of Braco, the dog which won best in show at the show in 1936. He continued to find other male dogs around the region to include in the reconstruction of the breed. In 1962, a Small M√ºnsterl√§nder female named Bianca von der Rumerburg was used in the breeding programme, chosen as that breed's standards mostly closely resemble the Saint- Usuge's. In 1980, the work on reconstructing the breed was handed over to Serge Bey, a local conservationist. Father Billard's breeding programme bred nearly 250 dogs over a 33 year period. The national breed club for France was set up in 1990 and known as the Club de l'Epagneul de Saint-Usuge. The Soci√©t√© Centrale Canine recognised the Saint Usuge Spaniel on January 8, 2003, placing it within Group 7 with other continental spaniels. While the breed is not fully recognised by the American Kennel Club, it is listed as a breed in the club's companion animal recovery scheme. Description It is a small French pointing breed, measuring at the withers according to the breed standard. They have a typical spaniel appearance, with ears that are located below the eyeline that have fringes long enough to reach the tip of the nose. The body should be well muscled with a broad, deep chest. The only color that the coat comes in is brown, but it may have white markings including a white \\"star\\" on the forehead, which some dogs can lose as their adult coat grows in. In addition to the ears; the tail, shoulders and chest should also be fringed with fur. The tail of the Saint Usuge is never docked, and should be long and curved. =Temperament= Described by its French breed club as easy to train, it is an obedient, passionate and affectionate breed. In the field it is suited to a variety of terrains, including swamps, water and thickets; quarry that the breed specialises in includes waterfowl and woodcock.

Formerly a fishery (along with nearby Bishop's Pool and Minister Pool), Stowe Pool was turned into a reservoir in 1856 by the South Staffordshire Waterworks Co..http://lichfieldhistoricparks.co.uk/stowe-pool/about-stowe-pool/ Before 1856, Stowe Pool existed as a mill pond, with Stowe mill located just to the west of St Chad‚Äôs Church. Since 1968 the reservoir has not been used for supply and is now a public amenity used for recreation purposes. Stowe Pool is a designated SSSI site as it is home to the native white-clawed crayfish. Hydrology Lichfield is built on two sides of a shallow valley into which flow Leamonsley Brook and Trunkfield Brook from the west. Leamonsley Brook originates from a spring in Maple Hayes and flows east through Beacon Park where it combines with Trunkfield Brook into a conduit under the Museum Gardens. The streams are then carried under Bird Street into Minster Pool and then pass into a pipe under Dam Street, Stowe Fields and into Stowe Pool. The outflow from Stowe Pool flows north as Curborough Brook, eventually flowing into the River Trent. Stowe Pool has a capacity of 217,600m3 (47.8 million gallons) and a surface area of 55,000m2 (14 acres), with an average depth of 3.95m. Natural History The pool supports a large variety of fish including, carp, bream, tench, roach, perch, pike and eel. Stowe Pool also supports a large and healthy population of white-clawed crayfish. Due to the isolated nature of Stowe Pool the crayfish are not exposed to disease which has spread into many of their other habitats. As a result of its crayfish population Stowe Pool was designated a SSSI site in 1998. Effective wildlife management of the pool has attracted various species of wildfowl, including swans, moorhens, coots and grebes. Stowe Pool has limited marginal vegetation, but its water plants include Polygonum amphibium and spiked water-milfoil. The shallow margins of the pool are dominated by extensive low-growing blankets of the water plant Chara aspera var. curta a nationally scarce stonewort. History Stowe mill which stood at the east of the pool until 1856 St Chad's Church from Stowe Pool Stowe Pool was originally formed in the 11th century when a dam and mill were constructed across Leamonsley Brook near to St Chads Church. The original mill was under the ownership of the Bishop of Lichfield and provided him with an important income from the city. The mill ground wheat and mixed corn from the 14th until its demolition in 1856. During this time the mill had been rebuilt and added to many times and during the 18th century it consisted of three water wheels and an adjoining smithy capable of iron manufacture, although it may never have been used for such a purpose. The pool was an important fishery in the 13th century under the ownership of the Bishop of Lichfield. The ownership of the pool passed to the city in the 16th century who then let the fishery to the public until 1856. In the 18th century the pool was frequently visited by Samuel Johnson, whose father had a parchment factory (today commemorated by the street name 'The Parchments') on the north side of the pool. Nearby stood an enormous willow tree, which became famous for its great size; it was much admired by Johnson, who visited it whenever he returned to Lichfield. Because of Johnson's interest in the tree, it became known as 'Johnson's Willow'; the current tree on the site is a descendant of the original. By the 19th century due to the slow flowing nature of the streams Stowe Pool silted up and only existed at its eastern end. The western portion was a bog known as ‚Äòthe moggs‚Äô. As Leamonsley Brook flowed out of the mill on Dam Street along Reeve Lane it split into two streams running east towards the mill at St Chad's. As the stream flowed out of the mill as Curborough Brook it split into two streams encircling St Chad‚Äôs Church and joining on the other side. During this time the pool was used as a sewer and discharge from local tanneries flowed into the waters. In the 1840s the health hazard posed by the pool brought a proposal for it to be filled in. In 1853 the South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. was founded and it was immediately proposed by John Robinson McClean to tap Lichfield‚Äôs plentiful water resources to supply the Black Country. In 1856 the mill was demolished, the silt was dredged and an embankment built around the pool to raise the water level bringing it up to its current size. A promenade was built on top of the embankment around the perimeter of the pool. Pipes were laid from the streams by the Museum Gardens, under Bird Street into Minster Pool then under Dam Street and Stowe Fields into Stowe Pool. The stored water in Stowe Pool could then be conveyed back towards Sandfields Pumping Station, where it was piped along the railway line to Walsall. Ownership of the pool was handed back to the city in 1968 when the reservoir was no longer needed for supply. Lichfield District Council have retained the pool for public amenity and stocked the pool with fish for local anglers. Since the draining of Chasewater the pool has also been used as a venue for watersports such as sailing and canoeing.

Early life Statkowski was born in Szczypiorno, near Kalisz, and initially trained as a lawyer. When he deserted the law for a musical career, he studied with W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ªele≈Ñski in Warsaw and then at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Nikolai Soloviev and Anton Rubinstein, graduating at the age of 31 in 1890. Musical influences His musical influences were mainly Russian, specifically Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky, but he was also attracted to German music such as the tone poems of Richard Strauss and the operas of Hans Pfitzner. His work has been described as linking the post-Moniuszko composers and the generation of Szymanowski.Holden, Amanda, (ed.) (1993). Article by Zofia Chechlinska, pp.1007-8. Operas Statkowski's two operas were Philaenis (or Filenis) (1897, first performed in 1904) and Maria (1903-4, first performed in 1906). The latter is based on a novel of the same name by Antoni Malczewski. It has achieved some popularity in its native country and has been performed in various Polish cities between 1919 and 1965. It was staged by Wexford Festival Opera in late 2011. Other compositions These include a set of piano Preludes (op. 37) and a Krakowiak for violin and piano,Fantastical melancholy of the musical wren as well as six string quartets and a number of songs. Later life In 1909, Statkowski was appointed to succeed Zygmunt Noskowski as professor of composition at the Warsaw Conservatory.Blom (1971), pp.660-61. His pupils there included Jan Maklakiewicz, Piotr Perkowski, Apolinary Szeluto, Boleslaw Szabelski and Victor Young. He died in Warsaw in 1925.

Exact date is ambiguous. Although there is evidence that such a title existed before (e.g. Afonso I appointed his half-brother Fuas Roupinho to the title in 1184), it seems to have been of only a temporary character, for fleets assembled in times of war.Pereira and Rodrigues (1904: p.313-15) The exception was perhaps Nuno Fernandes Cogominho who seems to have been appointed admiral by King Denis in 1307, and still had that title at his death in 1316, although the conditions are unclear. Nonetheless, Manuel Pessanha was the first person known to hold the title of Almirante-mor (Chief Admiral) as a permanent office for a permanent fleet. All the king's galleys were under his jurisdiction. The conditions of the Pessanha's title stipulated that he must maintain a corps of at least 20 Genoese naval officers at all times and was obliged to serve the king in military service on land as well as sea.Quintella, 1839: p.19-20; Vasconcelos de Saldanha, 1988 The office of Almirante-mor became a hereditary benefice in the Pessanha family - passing successively through his sons Carlos, Bertolomeu and Lan√ßarote. After the disastrous handling of the Portuguese fleet in the blockade of Seville in 1369, Pessanha's son Lan√ßarote Pessanha temporarily lost the admiral title to Jo√£o Afonso Telo de Menezes (Count of Barcelos), but was later restored by King Ferdinand of Portugal. The title then passed on through Lan√ßarote's sons Manuel II and then Carlos II, the last of the male line. Carlos II had no male heirs, but only two daughters (Genebra & Brites) and a niece (Catarina, daughter of his late brother Antonio, who had died at Aljubarrota).Caetano de Sousa, (vol. 3, p.54) In 1433, the title of Admiral went as dowry in the marriage of Genebra Pereira (daughter of Carlos II Pessanha) to D. Pedro de Menezes.Monumenta Henricina, vol. IV, p.211 After Menezes death in 1437, the title was passed on to his nephew Lan√ßarote da Cunha (the young son of Carlos II Pessanha's other daughter, Brites Pereira), but the office was de facto exercised by Brites's husband, Rui de Mello da Cunha. Being pre-deceased by his son, Rui de Mello was appointed admiral de jure in 1453.Baquero Moreno p.863-65; Caetano de Sousa, vol. 1 p.209; vol. 3 p.54, Vasconcelos de Saldanha (1988) After Mello's death in 1467, the title passed to Nuno Vaz de Castelo Branco, king's chamberlain and son of Catarina Pessanha,Baquero Moreno, p.754. According to Caetano de Sousa (vol. 1, p.208), Nuno Vaz's mother, Catarina Pessanha, was the daughter of Antonio Pessanha (died Aljubarrota, 1385), the son of the admiral Lan√ßarote Pessanha. who in turn passed in on to his own son Lopo Vaz de Castelo-Branco, c.1476. After the treason and assassination of Lopo Vaz de Castelo Branco, John II of Portugal handed the title to Pedro de Albuquerque in 1483.Pereira & Rodrigues (p.142); Caetano de Sousa (vol.1, p.246) But Albuquerque himself fell into intrigues and was soon deprived of the position. In 1485, John II gave the title of admiral to Lopo Vaz de Azevedo, a knight of the Order of Aviz (and a relative of the Pessanhas), and made it hereditary in the Azevedo family.Pereira & Rodrigues, p.937. According to Caetano de Sousa (vol. 1, p.208), Lopo Vaz de Azevedo was son of Gon√ßalo Gomes de Azevedo, alcaide of Alenquer, and Isabel Vaz Pessanha, the sister of Nuno Vaz de Castelo-Branco and daughter of Catarina Pessanha. That line having lost male issue by 1646, it was passed via female lines to D. Luis de Portugal, Count of Vimioso, and then after his death in 1660, it passed on by female line to the house of Castro (Counts of Resende). Around 1373 (exact date uncertain), the King created the office of captain-major of the fleet (capit√£o-mor da frota), initially a complementary position, covering the command of the alto-bordo ('high-sided',or sail-powered) ships of the fleet, leaving the Admiral exclusively in charge of the oar-powered galleys. The first capit√£o-mor was Gon√ßalo Tenreiro.Quintella, p.32 During the reign of John I of Portugal, Tenreiro was succeeded Afonso Furtado de Mendon√ßa (appointment date uncertain) and, in 1423, by √Ålvaro Vaz de Almada (Count of Avranches). The letter appointing Avranches designates a more extensive capit√£o-mor, covering the royal galleys and infringing on the traditional jurisdiction of the almirante- mor, thus suggesting that by this time, the title of almirante had become purely honorific, and the de facto high naval command had been absconded by the capit√£o-mor.Quintella, p.41-42 However, the letter appointing Ruy de Mello da Cunha as 'admiral' in 1453 temporarily restored his authority, including the 'alto-bordo' ships. In 1460, the admiral was deprived of his jurisdiction over arraes (fishing boats), which were passed to local councils.Pereira & Rodrigues, p.739 The title of 'Admiral' was made more specific with the establishment in 1502 of the Admiral of the Indies (Almirante das Indias), a second, separate Portuguese admiral title for the East Indies. Back in 1492, Christopher Columbus had been granted the ornate title of 'Admiral of the Ocean Sea' by the Catholic monarchs of Spain. Evidently, King Manuel I of Portugal felt that if the Spanish had an admiral sailing around, then surely Portuguese should have one too. So, in January 1502, just before the departure on the 4th India Armada, Manuel I bestowed upon the fleet captain Vasco da Gama the overwrought title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\" - or 'Admiral of the Indies' for short).Jo√£o de Barros (1552‚Äì59) D√©cadas da √Åsia: Dos feitos, que os Portuguezes fizeram no descubrimento, e conquista, dos mares, e terras do Oriente. Dec. I, Lib 6, p.24 The original 'Admiral' title became thereafter referred to narrowly as Admiral of the \\"Lusitanian Sea\\" (mar lusitano) (or simply, \\"Admiral of Portugal\\").

It was built in the Neoclassical style by the Italian architect Pietro Cantini in 1885 and inaugurated on 27 October 1892 Bogota Institute of Tourism website on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America with a performance of Verdi's Ernani. Background and history of the theatre on bogota-dc.com The auditorium was constructed in the tradition horseshoe-shape and modelled on the layout of the Palais Garnier in Paris, but only about half the size. The Col√≥n Theatre was declared a National Monument on 11 August 1975, and underwent renovations for three years. Between 2009 and 2010, the theatre was closed for extensive renovations.  History  The Teatro Col√≥n was built within an area of 2.400 square metres. Its Neoclassical style and its facade was designed following the Tuscan Doric order in carved stone, with three parts separated from each other by cornices also made of stone. It was built by the Italian architect Pietro Cantini, who was also working in the construction of the Capitolio Nacional (National Capitol) at the time. The construction started on 5 October 1885 in the same place where the old Ram√≠rez Coliseum and Maldonado Theatre used to be located. The Swiss architect Luigi Ramelli was in charge of the ornaments and the decoration of this construction. The theatre was named in honour of Christopher Columbus, and was inaugurated on 12 October 1892 to commemorate the Discovery of America. The Teatro Col√≥n was declared a National Monument by decree 1584 of 11 August 1975. In 2007, the theatre ranked seventh in a nationwide poll to choose the 7 wonders of Colombia conducted by the El Tiempo newspaper. On 24 November 2016, the modified peace agreement between the Colombian government, lead by Juan Manuel Santos, and the FARC, commanded by Rodrigo Londo√±o, alias Timochenko, was signed at the Teatro Col√≥n, this way ending more than 50 years of conflict and war between the two parties.  Main Hall  leftThe main hall of the Teatro de Crist√≥bal Col√≥n was inaugurated on 12 October 1892. Great artists have performed there and many international and national performances of a high artistic level have taken place too.

Capacity: 120 people  Victor Mallarino Room  Facade of the Teatro Col√≥n after the restoration carried out between 2010 and 2011. This scenic space has a particular significance for the emergence of the modern theatre in Colombia. It was here where Bernardo Romero Lozano promoted the creation of the Escuela Nacional de Arte Dram√°tico (National School of Dramatic Arts). Victor Mallarino was among the Spanish teachers that were invited then. He was a notable reciter and actor, and a prominent figure in the formation of this school, where the first actors educated in Colombia emerged, many of whom have contributed to the history of the national theatre. = Curtain of Gatti = The making of stage curtain was already considered in the contract signed by the government and Antonio Faccini. It was intended to cover the stage during the biggest inaugural functions or during special acts before the commencement of the program, therefore, it was thought it had to be a great work of art. Florentine artist Annibale Gatti was entrusted with the making of the curtain. It was precisely in Florence where he decided to make his work that was 8.75 metres high and 11.35 wide. The work was completed in 1890 and the curtain was officially hung up on 22 February 1891. As for the pictures on the curtain, the president Nu√±ez was inclined for them to portray opera characters. He ordered his commissioners Alejandro Posada, Roberto Su√°rez, Pietro Cantini and Antonio Faccini to do so. However, Gatti decided to portray the curiosity that people of the town could feel about the construction of the theatre and the lyrical performances at that time. Based on the information provided by the commissioners, he depicted three groups of farmers; men wearing \\"ruanas\\" (a type of poncho) and hats, and women wearing white shirts and long skirts. The farmers seemed curious and shared the stage with other 36 characters from different operas such as Romeo and Juliet (Gounod), Otello(Verdi), El Barbero de Sevilla (Rossini), Don Giovanni (Mozart), Ruy Blas (Marchetti), among others. The first group of farmers was placed on the right, and consisted of five people that paid attention to the explanation of a woman regarding some plans (apparently the facade of the theatre). What is really curious about this image is that the woman making the explanation is a farmer, not a person from an elite class, but a character from the same social class. A second group is located in the centre of the work, and behind the musicians another group can be seen watching the different lyrical characters who are dressed with stunning clothing and jewellery. The idea of Gatti of including rural characters can be interpreted as the need to integrate two worlds, one that is more developed than the other. President Nu√±ez showed his disagreement when he saw the draft and sent a letter to the commissioners asking for the figures of farmers to be replaced for more decorative ones. Finally Gatti painted the curtain with the required guidelines, the farmers that had been painted on the right side were replaced by a dance group, the centre and the left ones were also removed and replaced by muses of poetry and music, and an orchestra with ancient instruments was placed in the background.

Nanocrystal solar cells are solar cells based on a substrate with a coating of nanocrystals. The nanocrystals are typically based on silicon, CdTe or CIGS and the substrates are generally silicon or various organic conductors. Quantum dot solar cells are a variant of this approach, but take advantage of quantum mechanical effects to extract further performance. Dye-sensitized solar cells are another related approach, but in this case the nano-structuring is part of the substrate. Previous fabrication methods relied on expensive molecular beam epitaxy processes, but colloidal synthesis allows for cheaper manufacture. A thin film of nanocrystals is obtained by a process known as \\"spin-coating\\". This involves placing an amount of the quantum dot solution onto a flat substrate, which is then rotated very quickly. The solution spreads out uniformly, and the substrate is spun until the required thickness is achieved. Quantum dot based photovoltaic cells based on dye-sensitized colloidal TiO2 films were investigated in 1991 and were found to exhibit promising efficiency of converting incident light energy to electrical energy, and to be incredibly encouraging due to the low cost of materials used. A single-nanocrystal (channel) architecture in which an array of single particles between the electrodes, each separated by ~1 exciton diffusion length, was proposed to improve the device efficiency and research on this type of solar cell is being conducted by groups at Stanford, Berkeley and the University of Tokyo. Although research is still in its infancy, in the future nanocrystal photovoltaics may offer advantages such as flexibility (quantum dot-polymer composite photovoltaics ) lower costs, clean power generation and an efficiency of 65%,Quantum Dots May Boost Photovoltaic Efficiency To 65%, 24 May 2005 compared to around 20 to 25% for first-generation, crystalline silicon-based photovoltaics. It is argued that many measurements of the efficiency of the nanocrystal solar cell are incorrect and that nanocrystal solar cells are not suitable for large scale manufacturing. Recent research has experimented with lead selenide (PbSe) semiconductor, as well as with cadmium telluride photovoltaics (CdTe), which has already been well established in the production of second-generation thin film solar cells.

It is used to treat and prevent malaria, including chloroquine-resistant malaria. It is not recommended for severe or complicated malaria. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and itchiness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, hallucinations, and liver problems. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. It is not recommended to prevent malaria in those with poor kidney function. Atovaquone works by interfering with the function of mitochondria in malaria while proguanil by blocking dihydrofolate reductase. Atovaquone/proguanil was approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. It has been available as a generic medication since 2011. In the United Kingdom it costs ¬£2.10 per dose as of 2019. The wholesale cost in the United States is $US 2.82 per dose as of 2019. Medical use Malarone tablets, as issued in the UK. =Malaria treatment= Atovaquone/proguanil is not normally used to treat severe malaria, when an injectable drug such as quinine is used instead. =Malaria prevention= Since some malaria strains are resistant to atovaquone/proguanil, it is not effective in all parts of the world. It must be taken with a fatty meal, or at least some milk, for the body to absorb it adequately‚Äîand to avoid painful stomach irritation, which proguanil frequently causes if taken without food. Also, stomach irritation may occur if one lies down within a half hour after taking this medicine. =Resistance= Proguanil acts as a mitochondrial sensitiser and synergizes with atovaquone. When atovaquone is used as a sole agent, a high natural frequency of cytochrome b mutants leads to a high failure rate. This is potentially due to the high lipophilicity and slow uptake of atovaquone, which results in a relatively prolonged period of parasite exposure at ineffective concentrations. Specific mutations (Y268S, Y268C) have been shown to confer resistance in vivo, but the other mechanisms of resistance remain unknown. Adverse effects Side effects are generally mild. While some people experience side effects, such as coughing, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, mouth sores, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or weakness, the majority have none or few of these. Mechanism of action Atovaquone selectively inhibits the malarial cytochrome bc1 complex in the parasitic electron transport chain, collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential. The malarial electron transport chain does not contribute significantly to ATP synthesis; thus, it is believed that parasite death is due to the indirect inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which requires transport chain function and is essential to pyrimidine biosynthesis. Proguanil, via its metabolite cycloguanil, functions as a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, halting parasitic deoxythymidylate synthesis.http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_malarone.pdf =Chemistry= A standard tablet of Malarone contains 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250 mg of atovaquone. A pediatric tablet contains 25 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of atovaquone. History Glaxo Wellcome patented the combination of atovaquone and proguanil to treat malaria in 1999. Patent protection expired in 2013.Generic Malarone Availability The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a generic formulation from Glenmark Generics in 2011.Drug Details In February 2013, the United Kingdom High Court revoked Glaxo's patent on grounds of obviousness, which clears the way for firms to sell generic versions there.Atovaquone Proguanil (Malarone) Patent Revoked & Glenmark Launches First UK Generic References Category:Combination drugs Category:Antimalarial agents Category:Antiprotozoal agents Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Atovaquone/proguanil"},{"id":"30511325","text":"Karzakh is a village in Akhalkalaki district of Georgia.

It enrolled its first class in 2013. The first class of 40 medical students received their degrees on June 9, 2017. The school is made up of the Division of Biomedical Sciences and the Division of Clinical Sciences. In addition to undergraduate medical education, the school sponsors and co-sponsors residencies and fellowships in several fields. History The UCR School of Medicine is built on the foundation of the former UCR/UCLA Thomas Haider Program in Biomedical Sciences, which had been in place since 1974. The program was named in honor of Dr. Thomas T Haider, a Riverside spine surgeon. The program offered the first two years of medical school instruction at UCR to selected students, after which students transferred to the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA to complete the clinical clerkships for their M.D. degrees which are awarded by UCLA. Through this program over 850 students have begun their medical education at UC Riverside and completed their medical degrees at UCLA. After the opening of the UCR School of Medicine, the Haider program was revised and now provides a pathway to medical school for up to 24 UCR undergraduate students each year. The University of California Board of Regents approved establishment of the UCR School of Medicine in 2008, and it enrolled its first incoming class of 50 medical students in fall 2013.UCR School of Medicine Must Delay Opening Until 2013 In 2010 G.

In addition, the LCME found inadequate strategic planning, insufficient key personnel, and weak policies and procedures related to student advancement and diversity. The LCME also found limited clinical education opportunities in psychiatry and pediatrics. The school declined to appeal this decision.Directory of Developing Medical Education Programs In October 2012 the LCME granted preliminary accreditation to UCR, thus allowing the school to start recruit an inaugural class of 50 students, who entered in August 2013. This is the first time in three decades that an American medical school was approved after previously having been denied.UC Riverside medical school clears hurdle (Los Angeles Times). In June 2017, the school of medicine was granted full accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The medical school has a program that covers tuition if students commit to working locally for five years in pediatrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, general internal medicine, OB-GYN, general surgery or psychiatry. In June 2016 Dr. Deborah Deas, MD, was hired as the new Dean of the School of Medicine. Previously, Deas was the interim dean of the College of Medicine and professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina. During her tenure, she served as senior associate dean for medical education, chief academic officer, associate dean for admissions, and led the College of Medicine‚Äôs committee on accreditation by the Liaison Committee for Medical Education.

Some instances are examples of widespread internet censorship in general that includes Wikipedia content. Others are indicative of measures to prevent the viewing of specific content deemed offensive. The length of different blocks have varied from days to years. When Wikipedia ran on the HTTP protocol, governments were able to block specific articles. However, in 2011 Wikipedia began running on HTTPS as well, and in 2015 switched over entirely. Since then, the only censorship option has been to block the entire site for a particular language, which has resulted in some countries dropping their bans and others expanding their bans to the entire site. Wikipedia is currently blocked in China since 23 April 2019.  By country  =Australia= In 2018, Peter Kidd, Victorian County Court chief judge, placed a non-publication order on all of the evidence and the verdict in a trial of Australian Cardinal George Pell. The suppression order applied \\"in all Australian states and territories\\" and \\"on any website or other electronic or broadcast format accessible within Australia\\". This clearly included Wikipedia, which was cited but not charged. = China = Access to Wikipedia has varied over the years with the Mandarin Chinese language version being controlled more tightly than other versions. As of April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia are blocked in China. The Chinese Wikipedia was launched in May 2001. Wikipedia received positive coverage in China's state press in early 2004, but was blocked on 3 June 2004, ahead of the 15th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Proposals to practice self-censorship in a bid to restore the site were rejected by the Chinese Wikipedia community. However, a story by the International Herald Tribune comparing entries on the Chinese and English Wikipedias on topics such as Mao Zedong and Taiwan concluded that the Chinese entries were \\"watered down and sanitized\\" of political controversy. On 22 June 2004, access to Wikipedia was restored without explanation. Wikipedia was blocked again for unknown reasons in September, but only for four days. Wikipedia was again blocked in China in October 2005. Wikipedia users Shi Zhao and Cui Wei wrote letters to technicians and authorities in an attempt to convince them to unblock the website. Part of the letter read, \\"By blocking Wikipedia, we lose a chance to present China's voice to the world, allowing evil cults, Taiwan independence forces and others . . . to present a distorted image of China.\\" In October 2006, The New York Times reported that the English Wikipedia was unblocked in China, although the Chinese Wikipedia remained blocked. New media researcher Andrew Lih blogged that he could not read the English-language article on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China. Lih said that \\"there is no monolithically operating Great Firewall of China\\", noting that for users of various internet service providers in different locations in China‚ÄîChina Netcom in Beijing, China Telecom in Shanghai, and various providers in Anhui‚Äîthe Chinese Wikipedia was only blocked in Anhui. Advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders praised Wikipedia's leaders for not self-censoring. On 10 November 2006, Lih reported that the Chinese Wikipedia appeared to have been fully unblocked. Lih confirmed the full unblocking several days later and offered a partial analysis of the effects based on the rate of new account creation on the Chinese Wikipedia. Before the unblocking, 300‚Äì400 new accounts were created daily. In the four days after the unblocking, the rate of new registrations more than tripled to over 1,200 daily, making it the second fastest growing Wikipedia after the English version. Similarly, there were 75% more articles created in the week ending on 13 November than during the week before. On the same weekend that the Chinese Wikipedia passed the 100,000 article mark, Lih predicted that the second 100,000 would come quickly but that the existing body of Chinese Wikipedia users would have their hands full teaching the new users basic Wikipedia policies and norms. On 16 November 2006, the Reuters news agency reported the main page of the Chinese Wikipedia could be displayed, but not pages on some taboo political subjects, such as \\"4 June, [1989 protests]\\". However, subsequent reports suggested that both the Chinese and English versions had been reblocked the next day on 17 November. On 15 June 2007, access to non-political articles on the English Wikipedia was restored. On 6 September 2007, IDG News reported that the English Wikipedia was blocked again. On 2 April 2008, The Register reported that the blocks on the English and Chinese Wikipedias were lifted. This was confirmed by the BBC, and came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in Beijing to report on the 2008 Summer Olympics and the International Olympic Committee's request for press freedom during the games.\\"Beijing unblocks BBC Chinese site\\" , BBC, 31 July 2008 In September 2008, Jimmy Wales had a meeting with Cai Mingzhao, Vice Director of China's State Council Information Office. While no agreements were made, Wales believed that a channel of communication had been opened between Wikipedia's community and the PRC Government. According to a report published in American Economic Review in 2011, the blocking of the Chinese Wikipedia not only reduced the group size of its users, but also decreased the unblocked users' contributions by 42.8% on average.Group Size and Incentives to Contribute: A Natural Experiment at Chinese Wikipedia, Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang, Feng Zhu. American Economic Review. Jun 2011, Vol. 101, No. 4: Pages 1601‚Äì1615 In 2012, both the Chinese and English Wikipedias were accessible in China except for political articles. If a Chinese IP attempted to access (including searching) a \\"sensitive\\" article, the IP will be blocked from visiting Wikipedia for between several minutes to up to an hour.\\"Academics break the Great Firewall of China\\" , Tom Espiner, ZDNet, 4 July 2006 Chinese authorities started blocking access to the secure (HTTPS) version of the site on 31 May 2013, although the non-secure (HTTP) version is still available ‚Äì the latter is vulnerable to keyword filtering, allowing individual articles to be selectively blocked. GreatFire urged Wikipedia and users to circumvent the block by accessing other IP addresses owned by Wikipedia with HTTPS.McMillan, Graeme (4 June 2013) \\"Chinese authorities apparently started blocking access to the site this past May 31\\" , Digital Trends. In 2013, after Jimmy Wales stated that Wikipedia will not tolerate \\"5 seconds\\" of censorship, Shen Yi, an Internet researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai said, that while \\"Wikipedia is tough against the Chinese government, it may not necessarily be so grand when faced with US government or European justice systems' requirements to modify or delete articles or disclose information\\".\\"Áª¥Âü∫ÁôæÁßëÔºöÂÆÅÊÑøÊîæÂºÉ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∏öÂä° ÁΩëÁªúÂÆ°Êü•\\"5ÁßíÈÉΩ‰∏çË°å\\" (\\"Wikipedia would rather give up business in China than tolerate '5 seconds of Internet Censorship' \\"), Global Times, 13 August 2013. According to GreatFire, both the encrypted and unencrypted Chinese Wikipedia were blocked on 19 May 2015. Since June 2015, all Wikipedias redirect HTTP requests to the corresponding HTTPS addresses, thereby making encryption mandatory for all users and rendering the site inaccessible in China. As a result, Chinese censors cannot see which specific pages an individual is viewing, and therefore cannot block a specific subset of pages (such as Ai Weiwei, Liu Xiaobo or Tiananmen Square) as they did in past years. Wales said he would fly to China to lobby the Chinese government to unlock the site within two weeks at the Leadership Energy Summit Asia 2015 in Kuala Lumpur on 2 December 2015. The government of the People's Republic of China completely blocked all language versions of the site again on the afternoon of 4 December (local time). A large number of Chinese internet users complained about this blocking on social networks, although most of the complaints had been deleted after a short period. However, it became possible to visit Wikipedia in other languages on the afternoon of 6 December (local time) in China again. Wales met Lu Wei, the director of Cyberspace Administration of China on 17 December 2015 during the World Internet Conference held in Wuzhen, Zhejiang. Wales said that this was the first time they met and there was no consensus on specific issues, but that the purpose of the meeting was for the two to \\"meet and know each other\\". Wales told Lu Wei how Wikipedia and Wikimedia work in the world, and expressed hopes to meet Lu Wei and the Cyberspace Administration of China regularly in the future. When a reporter asked if he would order Wikipedia to hide some information to maintain stable operations in China, he responded \\"Never.\\" Still, Wales' own words have been censored; he said that the improvements in machine translation might make it \\"no longer possible\\" for authorities to control flows of information in the future during a panel discussion. However, in the official translation, his statement was that such improvements will help governments to better analyze online communications. On 23 April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China. On September 23, 2020, Wikimedia‚Äôs application for the status as an official observer at the World Intellectual Property Organization was rejected by Chinese government, because China‚Äôs representative claimed that they had ‚Äúspotted a large amount of content and disinformation in violation of [the] One China principle‚Äù on webpages affiliated with Wikimedia, and Wikimedia‚Äôs Taiwan branch has been ‚Äúcarrying out political activities‚Ä¶ which could undermine the state‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity.‚Äù = France = R√©mi Mathis, an administrator on the French Wikipedia, was ordered by the French interior intelligence agency to delete an article. In April 2013, a Wikipedia article describing the Pierre- sur-Haute military radio station attracted attention from the French interior intelligence agency DCRI. The agency attempted to have the article about the facility removed from the French Wikipedia. The DCRI pressured R√©mi Mathis, a volunteer administrator of the French Wikipedia and resident of France, into deleting the article. The Wikimedia Foundation asked the DCRI which parts of the article were causing a problem, noting that the article closely reflected information in a 2004 documentary made by T√©l√©vision Loire 7, a French local television station, which is freely available online. The DCRI refused to give these details, and repeated its demand for deletion of the article. According to a statement issued by Wikim√©dia France on 6 April 2013: Later, the article was restored by another Wikipedia contributor who lived outside France, in Switzerland. ‚Äì Le Monde, 6 April 2013 As a result of the controversy, the article became the most read page on the French Wikipedia, with over 120,000-page views during the weekend of 6‚Äì7 April 2013. It was translated into multiple other languages.List of translations on Wikidata The French newspaper 20 minutes, Ars Technica, and a posting on Slashdot, noted it as an example of the Streisand effect in action. The French Ministry of the Interior told the Agence France-Presse that it did not wish to comment on the incident. According to a judicial source quoted in an AFP story on 8 April, the article's deletion \\"was performed as part of a preliminary inquiry\\" led by the \\"anti-terrorist section of the Paris prosecutor's office\\" on the grounds that the French language Wikipedia article compromised \\"classified material related to the chain of transmission for nuclear launch orders\\". Following the incident, T√©l√©vision Loire 7 said that it expected that the DCRI would request that it take down the original 2004 report on which the Wikipedia article was based, though it had been filmed and broadcast with the full cooperation of the French armed forces. The National Union of Police Commissioners suggested that the next step would be for the judiciary to order French Internet service providers to block access to the Wikipedia article. However, the France-based NGO Reporters Without Borders criticised the DCRI's actions as \\"a bad precedent\\". The organisation's spokesperson told Le Point that, \\"if the institution considers that secret defence information has been released, it has every opportunity to be recognised by the courts in arguing and clarifying its application. It is then up to the judge, the protector of fundamental freedoms, to assess the reality and extent of military secrecy.\\" The spokesperson noted that the information contained in the article had come from a documentary that had previously been filmed and distributed with the cooperation of the army, and that the hosts and intermediaries should not be held responsible. = Germany = A 2009 court order forbade German Wikipedia to disclose the identity of Wolfgang Werl√© and Manfred Lauber, two criminals convicted of the murder of the Bavarian actor Walter Sedlmayr. In another case, Wikipedia.de (an Internet domain run by Wikimedia Deutschland) was prohibited from pointing to the actual Wikipedia content. The court order was a temporary injunction in a case filed by politician Lutz Heilmann over claims regarding his past involvement with the former German Democratic Republic's intelligence service Stasi. = Iran = In a November 2013 report published by the Center for Global Communication Studies of the University of Pennsylvania, researchers Collin Anderson and Nima Nazeri scanned 800,000 Persian-language Wikipedia articles and found that the Iranian government blocks 963 of these pages. According to the authors, \\"Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed.\\" Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a \\"useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet.\\" In May 2014, according to Mashable, the Iranian government blocked at least two pages on the Persian Wikipedia. In 2015, the Wikipedia software migrated to HTTPS protocol, leaving the Iranian government with no choice but to either block it completely or not block it at all. Iran chose the latter. Wikimedia Commons was blocked during the first half of 2016, but the block has been lifted since then. = Pakistan = For seven hours on 31 March 2006, the entire domain of Wikipedia.org was blocked in Pakistan because one article contained information pertaining to the controversial cartoons of Muhammad. The English version of Wikipedia was blocked in Pakistan for several days in May 2010 during the controversy surrounding Everybody Draw Mohammed Day. = Russia = On 5 April 2013, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (also known as Roskomnadzor) confirmed that Wikipedia was blacklisted, stating that it had been \\"for a long time. I don't know why it's only now that they've woken up\\". The same day, Roskomnadzor ordered the Russian Wikipedia to remove the article \\"Cannabis Smoking\\", or else they would block the entirety of Wikipedia in Russia. Internet censorship became more common after a new law was passed around November 2013, allowing the government to block content deemed illegal or harmful to children. On 18 August 2015, Roskomnadzor instructed Russian Wikipedia administrators to remove an article about charas (–ß–∞—Ä–∞—Å), a type of cannabis, by 21 August 2015 or else they would block Wikipedia (which they executed to a limited extent on 25 August). The article was found by a Russian provincial court to contain a detailed description to make a narcotic, deeming it prohibited information. Roskomnadzor explained that \\"insofar as Wikipedia has decided to function on the basis of https, which doesn't allow restricting to individual pages on its site, the entire website would be blocked\\" if they did not comply. In response to the impending block, the director of NP Wikimedia RU Vladimir Medeyko argued that the article had already been promptly and adequately rewritten to remove the controversial points and satisfy the order, using scientific articles and UN documents, and also attempted to preserve the text by transferring it to the article ‚ÄúHashish (:ru:–ì–∞—à–∏—à)‚Äù. Wikipedia representatives said if access was restricted, they would file a complaint to the prosecutor's office against Roskomnadzor and appeal the decision. Anticipating the ban, the Russian Wikipedia published a resource titled \\"What to do if Wikipedia was blocked\\". On 24 August, Roskomnadzor instructed Russian internet providers to block Wikipedia. By the night of 25 August, around 10‚Äì20% of Russian users had issues with accessing Wikipedia with access varying between regions and devices used. Also on the same date, the charas article was removed from the registry of banned sites. Roskomnadzor explained that they had \\"been informed by the Federal Drug Control Service that sufficient edits were made that met the conditions of court order\\". = Saudi Arabia = On 11 July 2006, the Saudi government blocked access to Google and Wikipedia for what it said was sexual and politically sensitive content.http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&section;=0&article;=85616&d;=19&m;=7&y;=2006 Wikipedia has also been blocked at least once since then. = Syria = Access to the Arabic Wikipedia was blocked in Syria between 30 April 2008 and 13 February 2009, although other language editions remained accessible. Arabic Wikipedia Disappears From The Internet in Syria , Menassat, 19 May 2008 (English translation ) = Tunisia = The Wikipedia website was inaccessible from Tunisia between 23 and 27 November 2006.\\"Tunisia: Censoring Wikipedia?\\" , Sami Ben Gharbia, Global Voices, 27 November 2006. =Turkey= In the early hours of 29 April 2017, monitoring group Turkey Blocks identified loss of access to all language editions of Wikipedia throughout Turkey. The block came after Turkish authorities demanded Wikipedia \\"remove content by writers supporting terror and of linking Turkey to terror groups\\"; a demand for which the government stated that it did not receive a satisfactory response. Before, Turkey had only censored specific articles on Turkish Wikipedia, such as \\"Kadƒ±n √ºreme organlarƒ±\\" (vulva), \\"insan penisi\\" (human penis), \\"2015 T√ºrkiye genel se√ßim anketleri\\" (2015 Turkey general election polls) \\"vajina\\" (vagina) and \\"testis torbasƒ±\\" (scrotum). There was no court decision for this censorship. One Turkish internet provider, TTNET, speculated that Wikipedia was broken. Katherine Maher from the Wikimedia Foundation said this did not reflect the truth. In December 2019 the Constitutional Court of Turkey ruled that the two and a half-year block was unconstitutional. On 15 January 2020 it was reported to the Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia's parent organisation) that access to the website was being restored. = United Kingdom = In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation, a UK-based non-government organization, added the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its internet blacklist due to the album cover's image and the illegality of child pornography in that country; the image had been assessed by IWF as being the lowest level of legal concern: \\"erotic posing with no sexual activity\\". As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system,AP: Wikipedia article blocked in UK over child photo and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means used by the IWF to block the image. Following discussion, representations by the Wikimedia Foundation,\\"Censorship in the United Kingdom disenfranchises tens of thousands of Wikipedia editors\\" , Wikimedia Foundation press release, 7 December 2008 and public complaints,ZDNet cites \\"floods of angry users\\". the IWF reversed their decision three days later, and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the same image that were hosted overseas. = Uzbekistan = The entirety of Wikipedia was briefly blocked twice in Uzbekistan, in 2007 and 2008. Blocking of the Uzbek Wikipedia caught the attention of the international press in late February 2012. Internet users in Uzbekistan trying to access Uzbek-language pages were redirected to MSN. Users in Uzbekistan could easily open Wikipedia articles in other languages. Only Uzbek-language articles were blocked. = Venezuela = Netblocks report of the developing incident of blocking of Wikipedia in Venezuela by CANTV as of 12 January 2019 In the evening of 12 January 2019, the NetBlocks internet observatory had collected technical evidence of the blocking of all editions of Wikipedia in Venezuela. The restrictions were being implemented by CANTV, the largest telecommunications provider in the country. NetBlocks identified a major network disruption affecting the telecommunications infrastructure, which coincided with other restrictions affecting Venezuelans' ability to communicate and access information during the previous 24 hours. The collected data also showed that a number of local websites had been recently restricted, indicating that recent political instability could be the underlying cause for what may be a tightening regime of internet control.

Divorce is considered to be welfare-reducing when one spouse's desire to remain married is greater than the other spouse's desire to obtain a divorce. In this situation, a divorce will decrease the combined well-being of the couple, and so could be considered destructive of overall welfare.Zelder, Martin (2008) ‚ÄúThe Intrinsic Social Cost of Public Goods: Revising (Downward) the Optimal Size of Government,‚Äù Research Symposium on Bad Public Goods, Northwestern University, http://www.law.northwestern.edu/searlecenter/papers/Zelder_Social_Cost.pdf. Bargaining in marriage If one spouse values a marriage more than the other spouse values a divorce, then (as suggested by the Coase Theorem) it would be expected that the spouse who wants to stay married would offer the other a greater share of whatever marital goods exist. This offer would be large enough to ensure that both spouses prefer marriage to divorce. In order to be applicable, however, the Coase Theorem requires frictionless trading between parties. In marriage, some goods are difficult to trade.Zelder, Martin (1993) \\"Inefficient Dissolutions as a Consequence of Public Goods: The Case of No- Fault Divorce,\\" Journal of Legal Studies, vol. XXII, 503‚Äì520. An example is so called marital public goods, which are produced within a marriage and benefit both members of the couple, but also have the characteristic that one spouse cannot exclude the other from enjoying it. If one spouse cannot exclude the other from enjoying a good, then that spouse cannot threaten to withhold or increase production of it, and so the good cannot be used in marital bargaining. If a significant portion of marital wealth is in the form of public goods, then bargaining may not be able to save a marriage, even though a divorce would cause greater overall unhappiness than remaining married. Zelder cites Gary Becker as one of the originators of the idea of using economic tools to analyze bargaining in marriage and the potential for marital public goods to cause inefficiencyBecker, Gary (1981) A Treatise on the Family, Harvard University Press.Becker, Gary (1973) A Theory of Marriage: Part I, Journal of Political Economy 81, p. 831-846.Becker, Gary (1974) A Theory of Marriage: Part II, Journal of Political Economy 82, p. S11-S26. Children and love as marital public goods One type of marital public good is the enjoyment of children.Haddock, David and Polsby, Daniel (1996) \\"Family as a Rational Classification,\\" Washington University Law Quarterly, vol. 74 (Spring). If both spouses care about the welfare of their children, then a happy child will benefit both parents, and neither spouse can prevent the other from enjoying this benefit. Some of the benefits associated with children are private, e.g., time spent with a child by one spouse while the other spouse is excluded.Zelder, Martin (2009) \\"The Essential Economics of Love,\\" Teoria, vol. 29, 133‚Äì150. If spouses‚Äô love for each other is largely a public good (within the marriage), then it also cannot be used to bargain to save a marriage. The paradox Zelder describes two aspects to the paradox. First, marriages may end in divorce even when the combined welfare of the couple would suffer from divorce. Second, the more effort a couple puts into those activities usually considered most central to marriage, such as love and the raising of children, the more likely it is that a sub-optimal divorce will occur. It seems odd that the likelihood of this outcome would be higher when a marriage is based on love and children rather than more prosaic matters such as money, sex, or household tasks. The key factor described by Zelder is that when the benefits of marriage are non-public, such as time spent on household chores, sex, or income transfers, then spouses can withhold them or offer to increase them in order to save a marriage. Public goods, however, cannot be withheld, and so cannot be used for bargaining. Evidence Zelder finds evidence supporting the Zelder paradox in higher divorce rates for couples with children in states with no-fault divorce laws. All 50 U.S. states now have no-fault divorce.,http://blogs.consumerreports.org/money/2010/10/new- york-legal-no-fault-divorce-law-50-states-.html Consumer Reports. October 13, 2010. but during the 1970s divorce laws differed significantly by state. (In a fault divorce regime, the presence of marital public goods has no effect on the likelihood of divorce, because spousal bargaining is occurring within divorce, not marriage.) In a no-fault regime, if only one spouse wishes to preserve a marriage, that spouse needs private gains (which can be transferred to the other) to succeed, and if a large fraction of marital assets are public goods, such bargaining will be impossible. Zelder (1993) found evidence that couples whose gains to marriage came disproportionately from children were more likely to divorce once the state they lived in switched to no-fault. Influence and reactions Zelder's work describing the Zelder Paradox has been cited in over 30 peer-reviewed publications according to the Web of Science, with citations in the fields of economics, law, and public policy.Langlais, Eric (2010) \\"On Unilateral Divorce and the \\"Selection of Marriages\\" Hypothesis,\\" Recherches Economiques de Louvain, vol. 76, No. 3, 229‚Äì256.Dnes, Antony (2007) \\"Marriage, Cohabitation, and Same-Sex Marriage,\\" The Independent Review, vol. 12, No. 1, 85‚Äì99.Smith, Ian (2007) \\"Explaining the Growth of Divorce in Great Britain,\\" Scottish Journal of Political Economy, vol. 44, 519‚Äì544.Bowles, Roger and Garoupa, Nuno (2003) \\"Household Dissolution, Child Care and Divorce Law,\\" International Review of Law and Economics, vol. 22, 495‚Äì510.Gordon, Robert (1998) \\"The Limits of Limits on Divorce,\\" Yale Law Journal, vol. 107, 1435‚Äì1465. The counter-intuitive nature of the Zelder Paradox is discussed in Ellman (1997).Ellman, Ira (1997) \\"Marriage as Contract, Opportunistic Violence, and Other Bad Arguments for Fault Divorce,\\" University of Illinois Law Review, No. 3 719‚Äì772. Ellman suggests that wives' advantage in the granting of child custody after divorce may reduce husbands' motivation for divorce, offsetting the effect identified by Zelder. Zelder argues that no-fault divorce was often accompanied by movement toward joint custody instead of exclusive custody by the mother, and that this movement makes it more difficult for a mother to threaten a husband with complete loss of parental rights after a divorce.Zelder, Martin (1993) \\"The Economic Analysis of the Effect of No-Fault Divorce Law on the Divorce Rate,\\" Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, vol. 16, No. 1, 241‚Äì267. Ellman also suggests that statistical corrections might eliminate the statistical significance of Zelder's empirical results, but offers no contradictory empirical results.

History For more than 600 years a Christian church stood on the site of Adler Street, White Church Lane and Whitechapel High Street, London E1. The original church known as the Whitechapel Church, St Mary Matfelon was the second-oldest church in Stepney after St Dunstan's Church. It was created as a chapel-of-ease for the local area in the 13th century. In 1673, the parish of Stepney was divided into nine separate parishes, one of them being the newly formed parish of St Mary's, Whitechapel. A third church was built on the site in the 19th century, largely at the expense of Octavius Coope; it was opened and re-consecrated on 2 February 1877. On 26 August 1880, the new church, which had been opened little more than three years before, was devastated by a fire which left only its tower, vestry and church rooms intact. It was rebuilt and opened once more on 1 December 1882, this time with a capacity for 1600 worshippers and including an external pulpit for sermons, some of which were given in Yiddish. During The Blitz, on 29 December 1940, an enemy fire raid destroyed the church. It was left in disrepair until it was finally demolished in 1952. The site of the church became St Mary's Gardens in 1966; it is now a public park called Altab Ali Park; an outline of the footprint of the church is all that remains of it. Among those buried on the site are the mutineer Richard Parker, the hangman Richard Brandon, the philanthropist Sir John Cass, and \\"Sir\\" Jeffrey Dunstan, the \\"Mayor of Garratt\\". The clockmaker Ahasuerus Fromanteel was buried at the church in 1693. The 'White Chapel' Whitewash made of lime and chalk was used as a paint on the outside of the original church in the Middle Ages, and gave it a bright white finish, prompting locals to call it the 'white chapel'. The church's prominent position on the westerly junction of Whitechapel Road made it a landmark of the area and eventually it became the name of the area. Architecture St Mary Matfelon's footprint in Altab Ali Park The church as it stood before its Victorian rebuilding is described in the book London and Its Environs in the Nineteenth Century by Thomas Shepherd and James Elmes, published 1829: > This church is of some antiquity, as appears by Hugh de Fulbourn being > rector thereof in the year 1329. It was originally a chapel of ease to the > church of St Dunstan, Stepney, and is supposed to have obtained the epithet > of White from having been white-washed or plastered on the outside. > The first church erected on the spot after it ceased to be a chapel of ease > of Stepney parish, was dedicated to St Mary Matfelon; a name which has given > birth to many conjectures respecting its signification, but which is > probably derived from the Hebrew word Matfel, which signifies both a woman > lately delivered of a son, and a woman carrying her infant son; either of > which significations is applicable to the Virgin Mary and her holy babe. > The old church being in a very ruinous condition, it was taken down in > 1673, and the present edifice was soon after erected in its stead.

The steeple, which is of stone, > rises above the principal door, and is crowned with a plain square > battlement. It was sometime since thoroughly repaired. A scandalous altarpiece Richard Welton was admitted rector of St Mary's on 30 June 1697. Welton had strong Jacobite sympathies, and regarded the Whig clergymen as apostates. About the close of 1713 he had a new altarpiece placed in the church, representing the Last Supper. The painter, James Fellowes, was instructed to portray Bishop Burnet in the semblance of Judas, but, fearing the consequences, he obtained permission to substitute Dean White Kennett with the words \\"The Dean the Traitor\\" underneath. The apostle John, depicted as a mere boy, was considered singularly like Prince James Edward, and Christ himself was identified by some with Henry Sacheverell. Crowds flocked to see the altarpiece, among them Mrs Kennett, who recognised her husband with indignant astonishment. Kennett took proceedings in the court of the bishop of London, John Robinson, and on 26 April 1714 obtained an order for its removal. Upon the death of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, Welton refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new Hanoverian king George I in October 1714. He was therefore deprived of his offices on 3 March 1715. 2004, index no. 101029031 Description of a Sunday service at St Mary's The following description of a Sunday service at St Mary's church appeared in East London Sketches of Christian Work and Workers by Henry Walker, published by the Religious Tract Society in 1896: > The church of St Mary Matfelon - to give it the old historic name - is > itself a message of beauty and graciousness in such a quarter.

It combines Solomonoff induction with sequential decision theory. AIXI was first proposed by Marcus Hutter in 2000 and several results regarding AIXI are proved in Hutter's 2005 book Universal Artificial Intelligence. AIXI is a reinforcement learning agent. It maximizes the expected total rewards received from the environment. Intuitively, it simultaneously considers every computable hypothesis (or environment). In each time step, it looks at every possible program and evaluates how many rewards that program generates depending on the next action taken. The promised rewards are then weighted by the subjective belief that this program constitutes the true environment. This belief is computed from the length of the program: longer programs are considered less likely, in line with Occam's razor. AIXI then selects the action that has the highest expected total reward in the weighted sum of all these programs.  Definition  AIXI is a reinforcement learning agent that interacts with some stochastic and unknown but computable environment \\\\mu. The interaction proceeds in time steps, from t=1 to t=m, where m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} is the lifespan of the AIXI agent. At time step t, the agent chooses an action a_t \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} (e.g. a limb movement) and executes it in the environment, and the environment responds with a \\"percept\\" e_t \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E} = \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}, which consists of an \\"observation\\" o_t \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O} (e.g., a camera image) and a reward r_t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, distributed according to the conditional probability \\\\mu(o_t r_t  a_1 o_1 r_1 ... a_{t-1} o_{t-1} r_{t-1} a_t), where a_1 o_1 r_1 ... a_{t-1} o_{t-1} r_{t-1} a_t is the \\"history\\" of actions, observations and rewards. The environment \\\\mu is thus mathematically represented as a probability distribution over \\"percepts\\" (observations and rewards) which depend on the full history, so there is no Markov assumption (as opposed to other RL algorithms). Note again that this probability distribution is unknown to the AIXI agent. Furthermore, note again that \\\\mu is computable, that is, the observations and rewards received by the agent from the environment \\\\mu can be computed by some program (which runs on a Turing machine), given the past actions of the AIXI agent. The only goal of the AIXI agent is to maximise \\\\sum_{t=1}^m r_t, that is, the sum of rewards from time step 1 to m. The AIXI agent is associated with a stochastic policy \\\\pi : (\\\\mathcal{A} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{E})^* \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{A}, which is the function it uses to choose actions at every time step, where \\\\mathcal{A} is the space of all possible actions that AIXI can take and \\\\mathcal{E} is the space of all possible \\"percepts\\" that can be produced by the environment. The environment (or probability distribution) \\\\mu can also be thought of as a stochastic policy (which is a function): \\\\mu : (\\\\mathcal{A} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{E})^* \\\\times \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{E} , where the * is the Kleene star operation. In general, at time step t (which ranges from 1 to m), AIXI, having previously executed actions a_1\\\\dots a_{t-1} (which is often abbreviated in the literature as a_{) and having observed the history of percepts o_1 r_1 ... o_{t-1} r_{t-1} (which can be abbreviated as e_{), chooses and executes in the environment the action, a_t, defined as follows Universal Artificial Intelligence : a_t := \\\\arg \\\\max_{a_t} \\\\sum_{o_t r_t} \\\\ldots \\\\max_{a_m} \\\\sum_{o_m r_m} [r_t + \\\\ldots + r_m] \\\\sum_{q:\\\\; U(q, a_1 \\\\ldots a_m) = o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m} 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)} or, using parentheses, to disambiguate the precedences : a_t := \\\\arg \\\\max_{a_t} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{o_t r_t} \\\\ldots \\\\left( \\\\max_{a_m} \\\\sum_{o_m r_m} [r_t + \\\\ldots + r_m] \\\\left( \\\\sum_{q:\\\\; U(q, a_1 \\\\ldots a_m) = o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m} 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)} \\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\right) Intuitively, in the definition above, AIXI considers the sum of the total reward over all possible \\"futures\\" up to m - t time steps ahead (that is, from t to m), weighs each of them by the complexity of programs q (that is, by 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)}) consistent with the agent's past (that is, the previously executed actions, a_{, and received percepts, e_{) that can generate that future, and then picks the action that maximises expected future rewards. Let us break this definition down in order to attempt to fully understand it. o_t r_t is the \\"percept\\" (which consists of the observation o_t and reward r_t) received by the AIXI agent at time step t from the environment (which is unknown and stochastic). Similarly, o_m r_m is the percept received by AIXI at time step m (the last time step where AIXI is active). r_t + \\\\ldots + r_m is the sum of rewards from time step t to time step m, so AIXI needs to look into the future to choose its action at time step t. U denotes a monotone universal Turing machine, and q ranges over all (deterministic) programs on the universal machine U, which receives as input the program q and the sequence of actions a_1\\\\dots a_m (that is, all actions), and produces the sequence of percepts o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m. The universal Turing machine U is thus used to \\"simulate\\" or compute the environment responses or percepts, given the program q (which \\"models\\" the environment) and all actions of the AIXI agent: in this sense, the environment is \\"computable\\" (as stated above). Note that, in general, the program which \\"models\\" the current and actual environment (where AIXI needs to act) is unknown because the current environment is also unknown. \\\\textrm{length}(q) is the length of the program q (which is encoded as a string of bits). Note that 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)} = \\\\frac{1}{2^{\\\\textrm{length}(q)}}. Hence, in the definition above, \\\\sum_{q:\\\\; U(q, a_1 \\\\ldots a_m) = o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m} 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)} should be interpreted as a mixture (in this case, a sum) over all computable environments (which are consistent with the agent's past), each weighted by its complexity 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)}. Note that a_1 \\\\ldots a_m can also be written as a_1 \\\\ldots a_{t-1}a_t \\\\ldots a_m, and a_1 \\\\ldots a_{t-1} = a_{ is the sequence of actions already executed in the environment by the AIXI agent. Similarly, o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m = o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_{t-1} r_{t-1}o_{t} r_{t} \\\\ldots o_m r_m, and o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_{t-1} r_{t-1} is the sequence of percepts produced by the environment so far. Let us now put all these components together in order to understand this equation or definition. At time step t, AIXI chooses the action a_t where the function \\\\sum_{o_t r_t} \\\\ldots \\\\max_{a_m} \\\\sum_{o_m r_m} [r_t + \\\\ldots + r_m] \\\\sum_{q:\\\\; U(q, a_1 \\\\ldots a_m) = o_1 r_1 \\\\ldots o_m r_m} 2^{-\\\\textrm{length}(q)} attains its maximum. = Parameters = The parameters to AIXI are the universal Turing machine U and the agent's lifetime m, which need to be chosen. The latter parameter can be removed by the use of discounting.  The meaning of the word AIXI  According to Hutter, the word \\"AIXI\\" can have several interpretations. AIXI can stand for AI based on Solomonoff's distribution, denoted by \\\\xi (which is the Greek letter xi), or e.g. it can stand for AI \\"crossed\\" (X) with induction (I). There are other interpretations.  Optimality  AIXI's performance is measured by the expected total number of rewards it receives. AIXI has been proven to be optimal in the following ways. * Pareto optimality: there is no other agent that performs at least as well as AIXI in all environments while performing strictly better in at least one environment. * Balanced Pareto optimality: Like Pareto optimality, but considering a weighted sum of environments. * Self-optimizing: a policy p is called self-optimizing for an environment \\\\mu if the performance of p approaches the theoretical maximum for \\\\mu when the length of the agent's lifetime (not time) goes to infinity. For environment classes where self-optimizing policies exist, AIXI is self- optimizing. It was later shown by Hutter and Jan Leike that balanced Pareto optimality is subjective and that any policy can be considered Pareto optimal, which they describe as undermining all previous optimality claims for AIXI. However, AIXI does have limitations. It is restricted to maximizing rewards based on percepts as opposed to external states. It also assumes it interacts with the environment solely through action and percept channels, preventing it from considering the possibility of being damaged or modified. Colloquially, this means that it doesn't consider itself to be contained by the environment it interacts with. It also assumes the environment is computable. Since AIXI is incomputable (see below), it assigns zero probability to its own existence.  Computational aspects  Like Solomonoff induction, AIXI is incomputable. However, there are computable approximations of it. One such approximation is AIXItl, which performs at least as well as the provably best time t and space l limited agent. Another approximation to AIXI with a restricted environment class is MC-AIXI (FAC-CTW) (which stands for Monte Carlo AIXI FAC-Context-Tree Weighting), which has had some success playing simple games such as partially observable Pac-Man.Playing Pacman using AIXI Approximation - YouTube  See also  * G√∂del machine  References  * \\"Universal Algorithmic Intelligence: A mathematical top->down approach\\", Marcus Hutter, ; also in Artificial General Intelligence, eds.

CMT allows the second order differential equation to be expressed as one or more uncoupled first order differential equations. The following assumptions are generally made with CMT: * Linearity * Time-reversal symmetry * Time-invariance * Weak mode coupling (small perturbation of uncoupled modes) * Energy conservation  Formulation  The formulation of the coupled mode theory is based on the development of the solution to an electromagnetic problem into modes. Most of the time it is eigenmodes which are taken in order to form a complete base. The choice of the base and the adoption of certain hypothesis like parabolic approximation differs from formulation to formulation. The classification proposed by Barybin and Dmitriev,\\"Modern Electrodynamics and Coupled-mode theory\\",2002 of the different formulation is as follows: #The choice of starting differential equation. some of the coupled mode theories are derived directly from the Maxwell differential equations Hardy and Streifer, \\"Coupled mode theory of parallel waveguides\\", Journal of Lightwave Technology,1985A.

History In 1901, the City of Harrisburg established Wildwood Lake as part of the City Beautiful movement, a nationwide reform effort conceived by social reformers to build civic loyalty and a sense of community among urban dwellers.History of Wildwood Park Friends of Wildwood Lake Nature Center, Retrieved January 15, 2011. In 1964, the city deeded 157 acres of the park to Harrisburg Area Community College for the construction of a campus and academic buildings. In 1976, the Dauphin County Commissioners and Harrisburg City Council agreed to the Wildwood Park transfer agreement, and the park was acquired by the county for the princely sum of $1.

Since 1987 the awards have been administered and presented by the National Book Foundation, but they are awards \\"by writers to writers\\". The panelists are five \\"writers who are known to be doing great work in their genre or field\\". General fiction was one of four categories when the awards were re- established in 1950. For several years beginning 1980, prior to the Foundation, there were multiple fiction categories: hardcover, paperback, first novel or first work of fiction; from 1981 to 1983 hardcover and paperback children's fiction; and only in 1980 five awards to mystery fiction, science fiction, and western fiction. When the Foundation celebrated the 60th postwar awards in 2009, all but three of the 77 previous winners in fiction categories were in print. The 77 included all eight 1980 winners but excluded the 1981 to 1983 children's fiction winners. The award recognizes one book written by a U.S. citizen and published in the U.S. from December 1 to November 30. The National Book Foundation accepts nominations from publishers until June 15, requires mailing nominated books to the panelists by August 1, and announces five finalists in October. The winner is announced on the day of the final ceremony in November. The award is $10,000 and a bronze sculpture; other finalists get $1000, a medal, and a citation written by the panel. Authors who have won the award more than once include such noted figures as William Faulkner, John Updike, William Gaddis, Jesmyn Ward, and Philip Roth, each having won the award on two occasions along with numerous other nominations. Saul Bellow won the award in three different decades (1954, 1965, 1971) and is the only author to have won the National Book Award for Fiction three times. National Book Awards for Fiction From 1935 to 1941 there were six annual awards for general fiction and the \\"Bookseller Discovery\\" or \\"Most Original Book\\" was sometimes a novel. From 1980 to 1985 there were six annual awards to first novels or first works of fiction. In 1980 there were five awards to mystery, western, or science fiction. There have been many awards to fiction in the Children's or Young People's categories. Finalists, general fiction This list covers only the post-war awards (pre-war awards follow) to general fiction for adult readers: one annual winner from 1950 except two undifferentiated winners 1973 to 1975, dual hardcover and paperback winners 1980 to 1983. For each award, the winner is listed first followed by the finalists. Unless otherwise noted, the year represents the year the award was given for books published in the prior year. Thus, the award year 1950 is for books published in 1949. =1950 to 1959= 1950: Nelson Algren ‚Äî The Man with the Golden Arm :No runners up were recognized.

Eisenhower on April 16, 1953, shortly after the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Speaking only three months into his presidency, Eisenhower likened arms spending to stealing from the people, and evoked William Jennings Bryan in describing \\"humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\\" Although Eisenhower, a former military man, spoke against increased military spending, the Cold War deepened during his administration and political pressures for increased military spending mounted. By the time he left office in 1961, he felt it necessary to warn of the military-industrial complex in his final address. Background Eisenhower took office in January 1953, with the Korean War winding down. The Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb, and appeared to reach approximate military parity with the United States. Political pressures for a more aggressive stance toward the Soviet Union mounted, and calls for increased military spending did as well. Stalin's demise on March 5, 1953 briefly left a power vacuum in the Soviet Union and offered a chance for rapprochement with the new regime, as well as an opportunity to decrease military spending. The speech The speech was addressed to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, in Washington D.C., on April 16, 1953. Eisenhower took an opportunity to highlight the cost of continued tensions and rivalry with the Soviet Union. While addressed to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the speech was broadcast nationwide, through use of television and radio, from the Statler Hotel. He noted that not only were there military dangers (as had been demonstrated by the Korean War), but an arms race would place a huge domestic burden on both nations: Legacy Eisenhower's \\"humanity hanging from a cross of iron\\" evoked William Jennings Bryan's Cross of Gold speech. As a result, \\"The Chance for Peace speech\\", colloquially, became known as the \\"Cross of Iron speech\\" and was seen by many as contrasting the Soviet Union's view of the post-World War II world with the United States' cooperation and national reunion view. Despite Eisenhower's hopes as expressed in the speech, the Cold War deepened during his time in office.See Cold War (1953‚Äì1962) and references cited therein. His farewell address was \\"a bookend\\" to his Chance for Peace speech. In that speech, he implored Americans to think to the future and \\"not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow\\", but the large peacetime military budgets that became established during his administration have continued for half a century.
