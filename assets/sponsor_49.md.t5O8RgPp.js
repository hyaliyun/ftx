Clive Barnes called it \\"spiky, yet intensely moving. A Fiddler on the Roof without music, but with blood. Unique, wild, funny. It still haunts me.\\" Simckes wrote the off-off-Broadway play Ten Best Martyrs of the Year, a Theater for the New City (TNC) production directed by Crystal Field, about the ten rabbis who were tortured to death in Rome for supporting the revolt led by Bar Kokhbah in 2nd century Palestine. Simckes said of that play, \\"I tend to make tragic comment in a mixture of styles. So what did I do? I wrote a play as if through the eyes of Hadrian, the Roman emperor, watching the genocide of the Jews from his balcony.\\"Tallmer, Jerry, \\"Nossig's Antics at Theater for the New City\\", The Villager, May 4, 2004, retrieved February 7, 2011.

The critic Richard McBee called it \\"a riveting puzzle,\\" and it has also been described as a \\"dark farce\\" and an \\"absurd exploration of history and the horrific times we live in.\\" His other plays include Minutes, a fictional encounter between Sigmund Freud and Gustav Mahler; \\"Soldier Boys\\" about Czar Nicholas's 1827 edict to recruit Jews into the Russian army for the first time, including children as Cadets, which had a reading at Theater for the New City with Judd Hirsch as the Czar; and \\"Open Rehearsal,\\" chosen by Edward Albee as first runner-up in the inaugural 2006-2007 Yale Drama Series Competition, He also wrote the screenplay for Sidney Lumet's movie version of The Last Temptation of Christ, which has not yet been produced. =Novelist and translator= Simckes's first published work was a translation of two stories by the Israeli author, S. Y. Agnon, followed by the short story, \\"Behold My Servant!\\", published in Stanford Short Stories 1962. His novels include Seven Days in Mourning and The Comatose Kids. He has translated a number of works from Hebrew to English, including Adam Resurrected, The Chocolate Deal, and Commander of the Exodus.

In addition to Hebrew, Simckes is fluent in Yiddish, and according to the director of the film Kvetch, Austin Kase, Simckes was one of the inspirations for the movie, and also appeared in it.Claudell, Matthew, \\"Kvetch director schvitzes out a movie\\" , October 8, 2010, Yale News =Psychotherapist= As a practicing psychotherapist, Simckes has worked with multi-problem families and imprisoned sex offenders. An article in The Israeli Fulbrighter notes that Simckes found a \\"dual vocation as a writer and healer.\\" After studying at the Kantor Family Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he began using brief writing assignments with patients in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, to help them deal with their problems. He continued working on this idea and eventually launched writing workshops in community centers, \\"attempting to foster literacy, empathy, listening skills, insight, respect, and resolution of conflict.\\" He believes writing exercises are especially effective because \\"they serve to highlight the problem in a way that it can be dealt with.\\" =Cross-cultural educator= Simckes has tried to bring all his talents and experiences to bear in his efforts among Israelis and Palestinians. He made \\"fostering cross-cultural insights and empathy\\" in the \\"interlocked perspectives surrounding the Arab/Israeli encounter\\" the core of his Fulbright year in Israel, at the University of Haifa. Simckes standing on bridge over Charles River, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1963 Among his initiatives were a creative writing seminar, \\"The Mirror of Fiction\\", and a two-way live interactive video workshop, \\"Celebrating Differences\\", broadcast on February 27, 1996. The live interactive TV seminar linked American high school students in the United States with Jewish and Arab students (both Israeli and Palestinian) in Israel. \\"He created a live bridge and prompted the participants to share their experiences on handling differences,\\" helping the students gain new insights about one another. To prepare for the Israeli video program, broadcast through the Massachusetts Corporation for Educational Telecommunications, Simckes made frequent visits to Nazareth, Beit Hagefen, and Jish to find students who were comfortable with writing spontaneously, and sharing their writing on the air‚Äîand prepared to listen, not just \\"to yell at each other.\\"  Use of language  Simckes has strong feelings about the use of English in workshops that involve both Israeli and Palestinians, because it is a \\"bridge language\\" and a \\"diffuser of power\\" in a political sense, interrupting \\"the implication of power through language.\\" He believes that the ability to listen is critical to both writing and healing, and hopes his writing workshops strengthen that skill. If people \\"can hear each other,\\" he says, \\"they become a community.\\" Awards His awards include two National Endowment of the Arts fellowships and the 1991 National Jewish Book Award in the Children's Literature category.

The film was based on Raymond Carver's 1978 short story \\"Why Don't You Dance?\\" and was released in theaters on May 13, 2011. Plot In Arcadia, Arizona, salesman Nick Halsey is fired from his job of 16 years following an incident in Denver related to his alcoholism. After stabbing his supervisor Gary‚Äôs tires with his farewell gift ‚Äì a Swiss Army Knife with his name on it ‚Äì but leaving it behind, Nick has a confrontation with teenagers outside a convenience store. He returns home to find his wife Catherine is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings are strewn all over his lawn; she has left a letter explaining that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and not to contact her. After spending the night on the lawn, Nick meets his new pregnant neighbor, Samantha, and pays a neighborhood boy named Kenny to watch his things. He discovers that he has been cut off from his credit cards, joint bank account, and phone service, and his company car is taken back. Almost arrested when the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick has them contact his AA sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia, who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on. Nick gets Kenny to help him sell his possessions, promising to pay him and teach him to play baseball, but is initially unwilling to let items go. He bonds with Samantha, who is still waiting for her husband to join her at their new house. Nick reveals that he had been sober for six months until a business trip to Denver, where he got blackout drunk with a female colleague; he awoke with no memory of the night before, but she lodged a complaint against him, leading to his firing. Finding a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah, Nick tracks her down; their reunion is awkward, but Delilah tells Nick he still has a good heart. Out of money and alcohol, Nick experiences withdrawal. Samantha brings him Valium and tells him to seek help, but Nick replies that she is no better than him for putting up with her husband‚Äôs drinking and frequent absences, and she storms off. Nick awakens to find Kenny has arranged his belongings with thoughtful price tags, and they sell almost everything. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits he was right, and has told her husband to either come home or get a divorce. She, Nick, and Kenny go out to dinner, where Nick runs into Gary, who reveals that the Denver incident probably did not happen: the female employee was fired for having a history of suing coworkers for sexual harassment, and Nick would likely have gotten his job back if he had not slashed Gary‚Äôs tires. When Gary leaves his beer behind, Nick refrains from drinking and returns it to him. Visiting Frank at his office, Nick answers a call on Frank‚Äôs phone from Catherine. He confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him; they fight, and Frank declares that Catherine deserves better than Nick. Driving him home, Frank observes that Nick‚Äôs marriage was bound to fail, and gives him Catherine‚Äôs divorce papers to sign, along with some money and the keys to Nick‚Äôs house. Asking Frank to tell his wife he is sorry, Nick walks home; he almost stops at the convenience store where he regularly bought beer, but moves on and spends the night in his old bed. The next day, he pays Kenny ‚Äì including what he skimmed for beer money ‚Äì and receives an appreciative hug from Samantha, whose husband has come home. She hands him the picture she took of him a few days prior, with the message from the fortune cookie he gave her: ‚ÄúEverything is not yet lost‚Äù.

Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brady employs 6,600 people in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Brady Corporation was founded as W.H. Brady Co. in Eau Claire, Wis., in 1914 by William H. Brady.Gurda, John, Sticking to It: A History of the W. H. Brady Co., 1914‚Äì1989, Milwaukee: W. H. Brady Co., 1989. In 1984, the company went public and began trading on the NASDAQ market. In 1998, W.H. Brady Co. became Brady Corporation and in 1999, the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol BRC. Today Brady has more than 1 million customers and net sales for 2013/14 were $1.225 billion.  Products  The company's main product lines are in safety identification, regulatory compliance, brand protection, laboratory identification and specimen tracking, visitor access, voice and data communications and precision die-cut components. They include do-it-yourself printing systems, labeling materials, signs and software, and lockout/tagout, spill control and regulatory compliance devices. Brady sells through distribution channels and e-commerce websites like bradyid.com. As a specialty business-to-business manufacturer, the company's products are rarely obvious to the general public, being mainly used inside manufacturing facilities, public buildings, computers, airplanes, and mobile phones. Prominent usages include: * Brady markers identified every pipe in the Manhattan Project's weapons plant in the 1940s. * Brady has supplied helmet logos for a number of NFL teams including the Green Bay Packers. * Brady Contract Services used on North Slope during construction of the Alaska gas pipeline. * Brady SPC sorbent products helped clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. More than 500,000 feet of oil booms, thousands of nets, 600 bales of absorbent pads, and more than a million feet of other materials absorbed spilled oil from the water.  History  Brady's first products were promotional calendars, painted signs and point of purchase displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing hundreds of millions of push cards: small paperboard cards with rows of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating. 1940s‚ÄîDuring World War II, Brady developed the wire marker card - numbered cloth strips on an adhesive card. These strips could be used by electricians and assembly workers by wrapping them around electrical wires, creating a numbering system to identify components. 1950s & 1960s‚ÄîBrady moved to Milwaukee, in an era of sustained growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and cut to length in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs. 1970s‚ÄîHaving sold their products through distribution and mail order since 1947, the company in 1970s established subsidiaries in England, Belgium, Germany, France and Australia. By 1980, international subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent of sales. 1980s‚ÄîIn 1981, Brady acquired Seton, a direct marketing business that sold nearly identical products. Seton's catalog mailings rose from 1 million in 1981 to 8 million in 1988 and in 1985. Subsidiaries were established in England, Canada and Germany by 1988. 1990s‚ÄîProduct lines evolved with developments in technology. The company introduced printing systems enabling customers to print their own safety signs, labels and identification products on-site. Software, along with printers, scanners and bar code labels introduced automatic identification and data collection. New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products. 2000s‚ÄîWas a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size between 2003 and 2010.  Sustainability The Brady Corporation says it takes a comprehensive approach to the sustainability of the company, its customers and the communities in which it operates. In 2012, it issued its first annual sustainability report. The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy, using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons. In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement.

H. Chirgwin (born George Chirgwin, 13 December 1854 ‚Äì 14 November 1922) was a British music hall comedian, singer and instrumentalist, billed as \\"the White-Eyed Kaffir\\", a black face minstrel act. Biography Born in the Seven Dials area of London, he was one of four children of a circus clown, of Cornish descent. He first appeared with other family members in the Chirgwin Family troupe in 1861, when they imitated touring minstrel shows. The family became regular music hall performers, until 1868 when George Chirgwin first appeared as a solo act, singing \\"Come Home, Father\\" in a summer engagement at Margate. Born simply George Chirgwin, he took the initials G. H. in his stage name from those of G. H. MacDermott, but in later life sometimes used the name George Henry Chirgwin. He worked for a while as a busker, and as a musical instrument salesman, gradually extending the range of instruments on which he performed to include piano, violin, cello, banjo, bagpipes, and one-string \\"Jap fiddle\\". He also sang in a falsetto voice. In the 1870s he toured with his younger brother, Tom, as the Brothers Chirgwin. He made his first solo stage appearances in London in 1877, and was immediately successful. He was noted for his unusual stage appearance, appearing in a cloak, tightly fitting jumper and tights, and an exaggeratedly tall top hat. Rather than using a fully blacked-up face as other blackface minstrels did, Chirgwin chose to adapt this by making one large white diamond over one eye. This meant that his stage character was only partly inside the blackface minstrel tradition, and was using the tradition in a somewhat ironical manner; and indeed his material included cockney material as well as straightforward blackface songs and sketches. He said that the make-up originated from an occasion when he was performing in the open air at Gloucester. > A storm got up in the middle of the performance, and a lot of dust was blown > into my right eye. The pain was so great that I naturally set to work > rubbing my eye and when I faced the audience again there was a shriek of > laughter. I had rubbed a patch of the black off round my eye, and the effect > was so peculiar that I stuck to it ever since. Though, of course, it was > some time before I adopted the diamond shaped patch as a distinctive > mark.\\"The White-Eyed Kaffir: A Chat with Chirgwin\\", The Argus, Melbourne, > Australia, 28 November 1896, p. 13d, reprinted at Footlight Notes. Retrieved > 24 April 2017 His comic performances included improvised exchanges with audiences, and he was noted for his rapport with working class patrons; one reviewer said that he talked to his audience \\"as though he were addressing a select circle of old chums\\". He interspersed his routines with topical songs of his own making, and always ended his performances by singing his signature song, \\"The Blind Boy\\". He became one of the most popular music hall performers of his day, and was also successful in pantomime. In 1896, he visited Australia, where in an interview he said: > [I] have no prepared patter, and I don't adhere to any specified programme. > My idea is to come on the stage and have a good time. When I get an audience > that I like I go off at score, giving them a melange of songs, dances and > instrumental music, and reeling off the dialogue just as it comes into my > head.... To show how I vary my entertainment, no one in England has ever > been able to mimic me. Many of the best mimics have tried to do so. Perhaps > one of them will say, 'Look here, Chirgwin, old man, I'm going to sing that > song of yours exactly as you sing it.' Well, that man will come to the halls > where I'm singing night after night, and when he thinks he has got me off > pat I'll wing it in an entirely different way, so that when he comes on > afterwards to mimic me it isn't a bit like, and he gets properly slipped up. In 1895 he bought Burgh Island, off the coast of south Devon, where he built a wooden house used for weekend parties. After his death, it became the site of the Burgh Island Hotel. In the 1890s, Chirgwin appeared in two actuality films, Chirgwin in his Humorous Business and Chirgwin Plays a Scotch Reel. He later wrote and acted in a silent drama film called The Blind Boy. A recording was released posthumously on the Edison Bell record label on a 78 record of \\"The Blind Boy\\", with \\"Asleep in the Deep\\" on the B side. Chirgwin continued to perform, and appeared in the first Royal Variety Command Performance in 1912.\\"1912 ‚Äì London Palace Theatre\\", The Royal Variety Charity. Retrieved 24 April 2017 He retired in 1919 due to ill health, and became the landlord of a pub, the Anchor Hotel in Shepperton, Middlesex, until his death in 1922 aged 67.

The council is divided into four districts Coweta, Fayette, Ronotohatchi, and Tussahaw. History The council was founded in 1927 as the Griffin Area Council, changing its name in 1930 to Flint River. Organization The council service center is in Griffin, Georgia. The council is administratively divided into four districts: * Coweta District serves Coweta County * Fayette District serves Fayette County * Ronotohatchi District serves Lamar, Pike, Spalding and Upson counties * Tussahaw District serves Butts and Henry counties Lawhorn Scouting Base The Gerald L. Lawhorn Scouting Base is the council's primary camping and recreation property, made up into three major parts. Those three parts being: Camp Thunder, the Flint River Adventure Area, and the Pine Mountain Backcountry. The most well known and visited of the three being Camp Thunder. = Camp Thunder = Camp Thunder is a Boy Scouts of America overnight council camp, the largest and most well known section of the scouting base, in Molena, Georgia. The camp is operated by the Flint River Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The scouting base is primarily known as a summer camp for the local council and the surrounding region. However, it also holds smaller winter camps and accepts troops from other councils and states for their events. Camp Thunder is the original property founded in 1938. Located on the northeast corner of the Lawhorn Scouting Base, Camp Thunder was donated to the Boy Scouts after the property failed as a peach and cotton farm. The original property includes Thundering Springs, the 3rd most prolific springs in the state of Georgia. The primary portion of the scouting base is centered around Lake Ini-To, an artificial lake, and the Fishing Lake. However, the scouting base as a whole is quite large in terms of Boy Scout facilities, being close to 2,400 acres in size. The camp and scouting base in its whole also acts as the venue for the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps' Raiders National Championship. The primary program held in Camp Thunder is the annual Boy Scout summer camp; it is the site of Lawhorn's traditional resident camp.  Flora and Fauna  :Flora The camp is located on the Piedmont Plateau of the Southern United States and the property has corresponding flora to that region. Quite common on the base are Southern Magnolias and various type of Oak. Relatively endangered species of plants and trees can be also found around the camp and scouting base. The threatened Longleaf pine is particularly prevalent on the property and has been the focus of some service projects by local scout troops. :Fauna Similar to many areas in the Southern Piedmont region, several types of wildlife are particularly common. White- tailed deer are native to the region and are commonly spotted in and around the camp. Copperheads and cottonmouth snakes can occasionally be found in the area as well, but are well managed by the camp's nature lodge counselors and ranger staff. = Flint River Adventure Area = The Flint River Adventure Area was founded in 1988 as the Lawhorn Canoe & Training Center, it is the second major section of the scouting base as a whole. It was the first Boy Scout high adventure base in the BSA's Southern Region and focused on canoe trips down the Flint River, ropes course and climbing programs, and mountaineering programs in north Georgia. When Thunder Scout Reservation was renamed in 2007, this camp was given the new FRAA title. The FRAA is located on the northwest corner of the Lawhorn Scouting Base. Structures in the Flint River Adventure Area include the Grand Pavilion, SkyWalk COPE Course, Eagle Mountain Climbing Center, River Experience Center, and 9 campsites. In 2010, new construction included the completion of a Cub Scout Shooting Complex that includes BB ranges, pellet rifle ranges, and archery ranges. This complex is open, but not yet complete. The Rotary Club of Griffin is currently completing a renovation of the old ranger cabin to establish a new \\"Adventure Office and Health Center\\" with an estimated completion of February 2011. In 2009, the adventure area's programs were re-written in an attempt to keep more programs on the property and limit the amount of transportation involved in activities. The caving and north Georgia programs were eliminated and replaced with a river trekking and backpacking expeditions. The camp ran 6 weeks of high adventure programs in 2010. For 2011, all the programs have been again rewritten, although the names remain the same. A new 10-day river and backpacking combination trek has been added (called the Muscogee SuperTrek). = Pine Mountain Backcountry = The Pine Mountain Backcountry, the third of the three major sections of the Lawhorn Scouting Base, consists of 2,000 acres and includes 16 campsites and 21-miles of trails. In 2013, the local Order of the Arrow lodge organized a Backcountry Development committee to revitalize campsites, trails, and increase promotion of the area. The majority of work has completed, though some projects are still ongoing.  Order of the Arrow  Ini-To Lodge chartered in 1945 and still active. Name changed from Thundering Spring Lodge #324 in 1952. * Coweta * Echota * Ronotohatchi * Tussahaw See also *Scouting in Georgia (U.S. state) External links * References Southern Region (Boy Scouts of America) Youth organizations based in Georgia (U.S. state) Griffin, Georgia 1927 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Boy Scout Councils in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Flint River Council"},{"id":"30131592","text":"Angelo da Fonseca was born in Goa in 1902 and died in Poona in 1967.

Early life Sarah Jane Rees was born at Llangrannog in Cardiganshire, the daughter of a mariner John Rees, and received her early education at the village school. She was a precocious child and insisted that she accompany her father to sea rather than undertake sewing and cooking chores, which she hated.John (1991), p. 80. However, this was not particularly unusual, as many wives and daughters accompanied men in local ships trading up and down the coasts on family business.Shopland, Norena 'Cranogwen' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales Seren Books (2017). She was initially educated in her local village by an old schoolmaster called Hugh Davies, who taught her both Latin and astronomy. She later attended school in Cardigan and New Quay, and for a time studied at a navigation school in London, where she gained her master's certificate, a qualification allowing her to command a ship in any part of the world.Deirdre Beddoe: \\"Rees, Sarah Jane...\\" ODNB Retrieved 9 January 2019. In 1859 Sarah Jane set up her own navigation school in her home village of Llangrannog. Shopland, 2017 Career In 1865, competing at Aberystwyth against men such as William Thomas (Islwyn), she won her first major Eisteddfod prize, for \\"Y Fodrwy Briodasal (The Wedding Ring)\\", in the \\"song\\" category. A book of poems, Caniadau Cranogwen, followed this victory, in 1870. In addition to teaching navigation and other subjects, she became editor of the Welsh-language women's periodical Y Frythones (1878‚Äì1889), a \\"platform for Welsh bluestockings and proto-suffragettes.\\"\\"Welsh Women Writers (1700‚Äì2000),\\" in John T. Koch, ed., Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO 2006): 1787. Rees had two significant same-sex relationships, previously described as a romantic friendship. Her first was with Fanny Rees, a milliner's daughter from Troedyraur, near LLangrannog. Fanny contracted tuberculosis and returned to Wales around 1874 to die. She moved into Rees' home rather than that of her family, and died in her arms. So affected was Rees that for 12 years she was unable to put flowers on Fanny's grave, and she commemorated Fanny in one of her best-known poems, Fy Ffrynd (My Friend).Norena Shopland, 2017 Her second relationship was with Jane Thomas, with whom she spent most of her life. Open about her unconventional domestic arrangement, Rees was nonetheless a committed Methodist, and toured giving lectures on education, temperance and other subjects. In 1869‚Äì1870, she toured the United States, addressing mainly Welsh immigrant communities as far west as California. She was one of the founders of the South Wales Women's Temperance Union (UDMD), when it formed in 1901.Deirdre Beddoe, Out of the Shadows: A History of Women in Twentieth-Century Wales (University of Wales Press 2000): 38.

During the Count's Feud (Grevefeiden) G√∂rvel Fadersdotter was held as prisoner there and confronted with various legal claims of her lands from her Norwegian and Swedish relatives and stepchildren. In the 1530s, she had the Danish monarch appointed her guardian to further protect her interests. At the death of her son in 1548, she was in sole control of large territories. Landowner Torup Castle in Sk√•ne G√∂rvel Fadersdotter was described as clever, sensible and was reportedly successful in her ambitions. In 1574, she renounced her claims on the debts owed to her by the crown, and was in exchange granted the fief Troll's Manor (Trolleberg) as county administrator. She later exchanged her Norwegian properties with King Frederick II of Denmark for equivalent compensation in Sk√•ne. Between 1582 and 1599, she granted the Danish crown her Norwegian holdings in Nordenfjeldske; Giske (Giskegodset), Finne (Finnegodset) and Bjark√∏y (Bjark√∏ygodset) . In 1582, she received the fief B√∂rringekloster in Sk√•ne and some minor parishes. In 1601, she made King Christian IV of Denmark the heir to her Danish and Swedish lands. Her Swedish holdings had been confiscated during the Northern Seven Years' War (1563‚Äì1570), but were given back at the time of the Danish-Swedish treaty at Flakkeb√§ck in 1603. G√∂rvel Fadersdotter managed her estates with the help of good tenants, obtained huge profits from her lands, and constructed the Torup Castle (Torups slott) in Sk√•ne after her own drawings. She only visited Norway once, but was from the 1530s a frequent guest of the Danish King, as he was of her. Among her estates, she preferred to live at B√∂rringeklost, where she acted as the guardian of many daughters of the nobility. She died at her favourite estate on 20 April 1605.

FLATTERY, Ch, Major, USAF 1 July 1970 History The cornerstone of the cathedral was laid in 1862. In 1863 the Ottoman Sultan, Abd√ºlaziz, donated 11,000 gold Turkish Lira for the construction and Christians from Lyon in France also contributed. The link with Lyon was due to missionaries from Smyrna introducing Christianity to Lyons in the second century. The building was finished in 1874, and dedicated on May 25, 1874, by Archbishop Vincent Spaccapietra, Apostolic Delegate to Asia Minor.His monument is located at the north side of the cathedral garden. Prior to this time, a church which is now the parish church of Sancta Maria served as the pro-Cathedral for the diocese. In 1965 the then Archbishop of Smyrna, Joseph Emmanuel Descuffi, granted permission to NATO Military personnel, both Protestant and Catholic, and their dependents stationed in Izmir to use the cathedral for religious services. Interior Interior of Saint John's cathedral The painting over the high altar of the cathedral depicts St. John, with the eagle as his liturgical symbol. He is pictured with pen and scroll writing his Gospel. The painting is autographed by its artist, A. Von Kramer. The other pictures in the sanctuary area are (on right) St. Augustine, St. Andrew, and St. Athanasius; (on left St. Polycarp, 2nd-century Bishop of Smyrna and martyr for Christ) and St. John Chrysostom. One panel is blank because the original painting was destroyed by fire early in this century. Additional paintings in the cathedral are as follows: to the right of the main entrance - St. Vincent de Paul giving Holy Communion to children. The second painting on the right is St. Peter and St. Paul. To the left of the main entrance, the first painting is of three early bishops of this area: Ignatius of Antioch (Antakya); Polycarp of Smyrna and Irenaeus, priest of Smyrna, who went to Lyons in France and became bishop there. The background for the picture of these bishops is the artist's conception of what ancient Smyrna looked like.Irenaeus was the Bishop of Lyons who wrote that Polycarp of Smyrna was martyred near the Agora about the year 150 and that he had received his instruction in Christianity from the Apostles. The other picture is of St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary. Mounted over the inside of the cathedral entrance is a painting which depicts seven bishops of the seven churches of the Apocalypse. This painting, originally done for the Sacrament Chapel at Cigli Air Base, was brought to the cathedral in May 1970. About 30 feet from the floor on the left and right of the cathedral are small medallion portraits of three bishops and three popes who helped in the construction of the cathedral: (on right) Anthony Mussabini, bishop here 1838‚Äì1861, Vincent Spaccapietra 1862‚Äì1878; and Andrew Timoni 1879‚Äì1904. (on left) The papal portraits are of Gregory XVI 1831‚Äì1846; Pius IX 1846‚Äì1878; and Leo XIII 1878‚Äì1903. Memorial tombs to Bishops Mussabini and Spaccapietra are located in the garden of the cathedral on the left and right respectively. They were carved by Carrara artists. As worshipers enter the cathedral grounds from Sehit Nevres Bulvari, they notice the initials D.O.M. above the main entrance on the facade of the cathedral. They are abbreviations for the Latin Deo optimo maximo \\"To the honor of God, the best, the greatest.\\" On the left of the main entrance is the dedicatory plaque for the building. Somewhat freely translated it says: This temple, (built) to honor St. John, Apostle and writer, (had) its cornerstone laid on 26 November 1862. Thanks (are given) for the generous offerings by (local) citizens and contributions by foreigners. Pope Pius IX, in the 27th year of his long pontificate granted it the high honor (of being) a Minor Basilica, and enriched it with the same indulgences as that of St. John Lateran Basilica (in Rome). He (also) donated the high altar, with its precious stones and metals. Vincent Spaccapietra, Vincentian priest, Archbishop of Smyrna and Victor Apostolic to Asia Minor and the Kingdom of Greece, dedicated it on 25 June 1874, the 27th anniversary of (his ordination to) the priesthood. (Present were) Lawrence Berceretti, Archbishop of Nazos: Fidelis Abate, Bishop of Santorino: John Marengo, Bishop of Tinos. The Baptistry, on the right of the main entrance, was not outfitted until 1916; as the dedicatory plaque tells. A local resident named John Moriconi was its donor. A priest by the name of Peter Longinotti was rector of the cathedral at this time. The side chapels of the cathedral are dedicated to St. Joseph (the present sacrament chapel) and to Our Lady of Sorrows. High above the sanctuary area, near the ceiling of the building, is a triangle with an eye in the center. The triangle is the symbol of the Blessed Trinity, and the eye represents the \\"All-seeing, all knowing wisdom of God.\\" References Roman Catholic cathedrals in Turkey Churches in ƒ∞zmir 1874 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"St. John's Cathedral (Izmir)"},{"id":"30131739","text":"The Fisher House, also known as the Norman Fisher House, was designed by the architect Louis Kahn and built for Dr. Norman Fisher and his wife, Doris, a landscape designer, in 1967 in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. Characterized by its dual cubic volumes, stone foundation and detailed cypress cladding, the Fisher house stands as a clear statement of how Kahn was working at the time, and how his work differed from that of his contemporaries. In the Fisher House, Kahn eschews the linearity of the modern plan and focuses on a simple geometry, allowing the cubes to provide a separation of public and private space. Known widely for monumental works like the Salk Institute and the Richards Medical Center, the Fisher house stands as a testament to Kahn‚Äôs ability to work with the details of small residential architecture. The Fisher House stands as the clearest example of Kahn's unique architectural style at the time, his use of the two almost perfect cubes differing greatly from much of what was being done at the time and setting him apart in his own field of design. History Dr. and Mrs. Fisher lived in a colonial style house in Hatboro, Pa., a traditional suburb outside of Philadelphia. Dr. Fisher ran his practice out of part of this house. The Fishers wanted to move into a new house, nearby that would operate more efficiently as a home and business. They chose a site that, though tucked in among the rather dreary typical suburban houses, had a stream running through the middle of it and held the promise of a special place. The Fishers met Louis I. Kahn in 1960. He was their second choice as architect, but a generous working relationship soon developed. The Fishers set a budget $45,000.00 and Kahn was forced to strike three rooms from the first sketch plan he drew. Kahn was already working on the Salk Institute and the Capital Complex, in Bangladesh, so he was fortunate to find such patient clients, as the design process was quite lengthy, taking 7 years to complete. There were several different schemes proposed before Kahn and the Fishers were both satisfied. If some small thing needed to be changed, Kahn would start over with the design, feeling that the total composition would be compromised if things were simply altered. In the very first scheme, the two separate square volumes are apparent. The circulation is mostly vertical and separated within each volume. In this design, Kahn had the large stone fireplace, which would separate the living area and dining area. Kahn would stray far from this original concept, even incorporating a circle in square motif, before he returned to the idea of two volumes. It was while in Dacca, Bangladesh working on the Capitol Complex, that Kahn discovered the idea of two cubes intersecting at an angle. His initial plan called for one volume to be masonry and the other to be wood. Kahn eventually relinquished this idea, due to budget restrictions, and the final plan is a masonry foundation and plinth with the two wooden cubes resting on top. The wood is meticulously crafted with deep window pockets and built-in cabinets, tables and seating almost as if the house is a large and complex piece of furniture in and of itself. The Fisher house, though a small residential project, came during a time of intense work for Kahn and allowed him to explore some of the ideas that would appear in later large works. Site and context The Fisher House is located in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, a small suburban community outside of Philadelphia. Hatboro was originally farmland, with the first land titles being issued in 1711, but as was the case in rural places in close proximity to cities, began to grow dramatically after World War II. At the time of construction, Hatboro had a population of about 7,300. According to the latest census figures the population level is almost exactly the same today. The house is sited along the top ridge of a slight hill just off of Mill Road. Its entry faces the street and is much more closed on this side. At the rear of the house lies a small wood and a creek runs along at the bottom of the hill. Stepping away from traditional siting methods, Kahn turned the living quarters to face the northeast so that the view of the woods could be framed in the dramatic double height window construction. The majority of housing in Hatboro is typical Neo- Colonial suburban housing of the post war years. The Fisher house stands out as distinctly modernist in its context, though the house is less modern than it could have been. Kahn had originally planned on an all stone construction but was forced away from that idea due to the prohibitive cost of building in all stone in Pennsylvania. The all stone designs also would have lacked the warmth and homely atmosphere he and the Fisher family wished to create with the design of the house. Because Pennsylvania is cold in the winter and warm in the summer, Kahn included double windows in the house. Double windows allow sunlight into the house in the winter when it is low on the horizon and keeps it out in the summer when the sun is higher in the sky. This allows for passive solar energy transfer in the winter but reduced transfer in the summer. Form and use The Fisher House uses form to separate the different programmatic uses of a home. The public and private are divided between two distinct two story nearly cubic volumes. Kahn can even be quoted saying that \\"I always start with squares,\\" so the cubic nature of this project is not at all dissimilar to his other works of the period. The private volume is aligned along the north‚Äìsouth axis and the public, which is rotated exactly 45 degrees, is aligned along a northeast southwest line which runs parallel to the driveway. The public volume intersects the north face of the private with its southeast corner. The public space, which is perfectly square in plan, holds the entrance corridor and the master bedroom at ground level and two other bedrooms above. The second volume is slightly off square, having a rectangular plan, and holds the living, dining and kitchen space in a double height room. There is little distinction between the spaces dedicated to these three rooms and their differences from each other, encouraging a communal experience of the space. Throughout the house there are deeply recessed windows. These allow light in during winter and keep out direct light in summer. The recession of the windows provides further use than simply the circulation of light and air through the home. Kahn often used the windows indentations into the home to create occupiable spaces, such as benches, as well as storage spaces in the home such as closets and bookshelves. These uses were seen as very innovative at the time. The best example of these changes can be found in the main living area near the large hearth. Kahn created details out of the window ledge, and created not only a seating area, but also a set of selves for out of sight storage. The deep recession also allows them to be opened during storms without allowing rain to come into the house. There is a large stone hearth just off center in the living cube that creates a slight separation in the living room and the kitchen area, but the kitchen still opens more to the public realm that was traditionally the case at this time. The decision to create two distinct volumes was driven by the original dual design requirement of home and physician‚Äôs office. Though the office was dropped, the two volumes remain and serve well the need for privacy in a home. Significance The Fisher House lies in the midst of a prolific period of design for Kahn. It is bookended by the Margaret Esherick house and the Phillips Exeter Academy Library and was built during the same period as the Salk Institute. Like many architects, Kahn used his housing commissions to test his ideas about architecture. Kahn sought a sense of monumentality and longevity in his work, but also strove to bring the ideas of modernism to a place of familiarity. In the Fisher house, Kahn uses the stone plinth to create a sense of timelessness. In this plinth he has created a piece of archeology. The woodwork used in the Fisher house creates the sense of warmth and tradition to an otherwise starkly modern design. Material choices The foundation of the home is built entirely of stone in, for Kahn, a traditional style of building. The stone foundation was necessary due to the home‚Äôs placement on a slope and its need for a solid anchoring into the ground of the site. The exterior and interior portions of the home are made from the same cedar wood sourced from the local Pennsylvania area. This was done to keep down costs. The woodwork of the Fisher house is often viewed as the most comprehensive of any of his woodwork during the period. Later projects were said to lack the continuity of the Fisher House, often smaller details such as interior doors were left unadorned in a way that left the project feeling incomplete to viewers. It was best in the end that Kahn was not allowed to build from all stone, because if he had the home would have been lacking in much of the great detail work that makes it so famous. The use of cedar wood throughout the interior and exterior of the home compelled Kahn to create amazing details in the building simply by folding windows into the building envelope to provide new habitable space on both the interior and exterior of the building. Had Kahn been left to build the Fisher House entirely from stone on the exterior then the details he created from windows never would have come into existence.

Matriculating at the University of Glasgow November 1800, he graduated M.A. in 1806. He was then appointed second master of Stirling grammar school, but, having become a convert to the Scottish Episcopal Church, he resigned the post and opened a school of his own. In 1808 Russell was admitted into deacon's orders, and ordained to the charge of a small congregation in Alloa; he continued with his school until his appointment in the autumn of the following year to the charge of St. James's Chapel, Leith. In 1831 he was made dean of the diocese of Edinburgh, and on 8 October 1837 he was ordained bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, on the separation of the diocese from Edinburgh and St. Andrews. The religious opinions of Russell were liberal enough to cause his orthodoxy to be questioned. Russell was active on behalf of the bill passed in 1840 removing religious disabilities from Scottish episcopalians. In 1820 he received the degree of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow, and in 1842 the University of Oxford conferred on him the diploma degree of D.C.L., for which he was admitted a member of St John's College.

History AWP was founded in 1969 at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association. One of its co- founders was Phyllis Chesler.Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies, Psychology, and Mental Health, Phyllis Chesler, Esther D. Rothblum, Ellen Cole, Haworth Press, 1995, p. 1. At the time, there was no national organization nor division thereof addressing issues related to the psychology of women. Also in 1969, after an Association for Women in Psychology group had worked on a series of demands, Phyllis Chesler and Dr. Dorothy Riddle presented the demands at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association. Chesler prepared a statement on the APA's obligations to women and demanded one million dollars in reparation for the damage psychology had perpetrated against allegedly mentally ill and traumatized women.Robert Reinhold, \\"Women Criticize Psychology Unit; $1-Million in Reparations Is Demanded at Convention\\", The New York Times, September 6, 1970. Members of the Association for Women in Psychology also picketed the APA's Board of Directors meeting, to raise awareness of the sexism within the organization and the field of psychology in general.Tiefer, L. (1991). \\"A brief history of the Association for Women in Psychology\\". Psychology of Women Quarterly, 15, pp. 635-649. In response, APA eventually established a division on the Psychology of Women (Division 35) in 1973. Together, AWP and Division 35 successfully advocated for a Women's Program Office at APA's national headquarters. Status AWP remains an independent organization, operating separately from Division 35, outside of APA's organizational structure. AWP has held non- governmental organization (NGO) status within the United Nations since 1976. AWP maintains a broad membership inclusive of all people interested in the psychology of women. AWP sponsors regional and national conferences on feminist psychology and offers several awards to recognize significant contributions to the psychology of women. AWP also collaborates with other organizations in support of feminist approaches to psychological theory, research, pedagogy, teaching, and mental health issues.

Howfield, who played college football at the University of Tennessee, is the son of former NFL placekicker Bobby Howfield. Al Harvin, \\"From Father to Son, Howfields Know Leahy\\", The New York Times, Oct 12, 1991 Howfield played six years in the National Football League as a placekicker: Miami Dolphins in 1987, Seattle Seahawks from 1988‚Äì1989 (signed to the practice squad for both years), Denver Broncos in 1990, Houston Oilers in 1990‚Äì1991, Philadelphia Eagles in 1992 and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1993. He led the Oilers in scoring in 1991. Early life and college career Howfield graduated from Columbine High School 1984, then attended Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas from 1984 to 1985. He transferred to the University of Tennessee in 1986 to begin his placekicking career, graduating in 1987. Professional career =National Football League= Howfield struggled to latch onto a professional team in his early career, with tryouts in the NFL and World League of American Football failing to lead to active signings. He eventually joined the amateur team Oklahoma City Twisters, an opportunity that was presented when he won a halftime fan kicking contest at one of their games. In August 1991, Howfield was watching the Houston Oilers' preseason game against the San Diego Chargers at The InnerUrban sports bar with his Twisters teammates, during which he proclaimed he could perform better than Houston kicker Teddy Garcia after Garcia missed two extra points. Howfield's agent contacted Oilers general manager Mike Holovak, who coached his father with the New York Jets in the 1970s, for a tryout. He eventually beat out Garcia and Raul Allegre for the Oilers' kicking position after making all three field goal attempts in his preseason debut against the Dallas Cowboys. Despite making eight of ten field goals and 18 of 19 extra points to begin his pro career, Howfield struggled in October, including missing two extra points against the Cincinnati Bengals. He later missed a game-winning 33-yard field goal against the Washington Redskins, who went on to win 16‚Äì13 in overtime. He was released by the Oilers shortly after. He also played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squads but never made an active NFL roster again and was out of the NFL entirely after 1993. =Arena Football League= In 1993, Howfield joined the Dallas Texans of the Arena Football League, where he was 7 for 27 (25.9%) in field goals and 19 for 23 (82.6%) in extra points. He moved to the Fort Worth Cavalry in 1995, where he made 10 of 29 (34.5%) field goals and 40 of 53 (75.5%) extra points. 1995 saw his first full season in the AFL with the Las Vegas Sting, during which he led the league in scoring for kickers with 120 points, a then-league-record field goal percentage at 71.4 (20 of 28), field goals made (20), extra point percentage (91 percent), and longest field goal (61 yards against the Miami Hooters). He was named Micatin Arena League Kicker of the Year and Second Team All-Arena for his season. He joined the Anaheim Piranhas in 1996, where he went 21 for 43 (48.8%) in field goals and 63 for 73 (86.3%) in extra points. In 1996, he led the league in field goals made with 21 and was second in FG percentage at 48.8. The following year, he had a league-best 21 field goals made with a 47.7 conversion percentage, along with 62 for 74 on extra points. Howfield was in a life-threatening car accident that cut his career short at the end of the 1997 season in Las Vegas. He received two disk fusions in his lower back and an entire right knee cartilage replacement, and was out of football for five years recovering from the injuries (1998 to 2002). He made a comeback in 2003 with the Tampa Bay Storm. In his first game back from the car accident, he made all three field goals. Howfield moved to the New York Dragons later that year, and concluded the season with a league-best 66.6 conversion percentage (10 of 15), followed by a 31-yard game winner in the playoffs as time expired to advance to the quarterfinals. He retired at the end of the 2003 season, but came back in 2004 with the Las Vegas Gladiators, where he played four games to fill in for injured kickers. He was three for five (60%) in field goals and 18 for 21 (85.7) in extra points. At the time of his final retirement, he held various league and team records and stats: * All-time 2-point drop kicks: 5th (2) * All-time field goal percentage: 15th (49%) * All-time field goal percentage in a season: 7th in 1995 with 71.4% (20 of 28).

Influenced both musically and visually by the likes of Alice Cooper, Rob Zombie, Gwar, Kiss and Black Sabbath, Rosemary's Billygoat are best known for their theatrical horror-themed stage shows which incorporate many comically absurd props and stunts, including pyrotechnics, fire breathing, electric chairs, mock crucifixion, flaming pentagrams and various costumed monsters and creatures. Musically, the band has been described as \\"aggro and dark yet jovial\\", showcasing an \\"oozing brew of doom, stoner metal, dark psychedelic rock and hardcore punk\\". Over the last two decades, Rosemary's Billygoat have attracted a strong cult following in the Los Angeles punk and metal underground, having shared stages with the likes of such cult bands as Gwar, W.A.S.P., The Dickies, Circle Jerks, 45 Grave, Haunted Garage and more; in 2013, the OC Weekly newspaper ranked Rosemary's Billygoat number 10 on their list of the ten greatest shock rock bands of all time. Biography ;20th century activities The exact origins of Rosemary's Billygoat are vague and largely undocumented by both the band and the music press; website Sonic Eclectic once remarked \\"as far as incomplete biographies go, Rosemary‚Äôs Billygoat may have the most incomplete-est\\". According to several unverified accounts, the genesis of Rosemary's Billygoat began when singer Mike Odd met drummer Denis Fleps while working at a head shop together in Hermosa Beach. The two would regularly attend shows for such theatrical comedy bands as Haunted Garage, Celebrity Skin and the Imperial Butt Wizards, the latter of which Mike Odd became a performer for, and after recruiting bassist Lance Underpantz and former Nip Drivers guitarist Neal Gargantua, formed Rosemary's Billygoat in 1991. In a 2017 interview, Odd clarified that drummer Paul Bearer of the Imperial Butt Wizards and bassist Pat Trick of The Detonators joined roughly two or three years later, and the band has retained the same line-up ever since. In 1993, Rosemary's Billygoat made their recorded debut on the 7\\" split Songs for Gentlemen with the Imperial Butt Wizards, where Subterranean Records described their early sound as \\"militant witchcraft punk with a Motown edge\\", while Odd himself retrospectively described it as \\"drunk rock\\". In 1994, Rosemary's Billygoat self-released their debut album Pizza of Darkness on picture disc, produced by noted punk rock producer Geza X. After signing with Los Angeles indie label Porterhouse Records in 1997, the band released their second album Cheeses of Nazareth, produced by Steve Kravac and Bad Religions Greg Hetson. Hetson, in addition to contributing lap steel guitar on the album, wrote its liner notes, fondly reminiscing about the first time he had seen the band play at Los Angeles' Club Lingerie and writing \\"if you enjoy the theatrics of Gwar and Marilyn Manson; if you can appreciate eclectic musical genius ranging from the Butthole Surfers to Black Sabbath, then get down on your knees and worship at the altar of Rosemary's Billygoat!\\".Hetson, Greg. Cheeses of Nazareth liner notes, 1998 ;21st century activities Rosemary's Billygoat performing in Los Angeles in 2016. Rosemary's Billygoat underwent a shift in their visual style in 2002, when the band recruited special effects artist Craig Macintyre to help design new props and outfits for the group including goat-exoskeleton structures and monster-type prop art, effectively creating their current over-the-top horror-themed imagery and stage show. This was followed by the release of Rosemary's Billygoat's third album Evilution, again produced by Steve Kravac. Though the band continued to be a popular live attraction, critical response towards the album was mixed: Allmusic, rating the album with three stars out of five, summarized that Rosemary's Billygoat were \\"sure to appeal to horror movie fans\\", drawing favorable comparisons to Gwar, Megadeth and Corrosion of Conformity and praising Neal Gargantua's \\"inviting riffs and wicked soloing\\", but criticizing Mike Odd's \\"grating\\" vocals and their \\"laughable\\" cover of Pat Benatars \\"Hell Is for Children\\". In 2008, Rosemary's Billygoat embarked on a national tour with similarly theatrical Los Angeles horror rock bands on what was dubbed \\"The Hollywood Freak Show\\", a tour spanning nearly sixty shows in thirty states. A documentary film entitled The Hollywood Freak Show: Skatopia chronicling the tour and its stop at Skatopia in Rutland, Ohio was shot but ultimately unfinished. On December 14, 2012, Rosemary's Billygoat released their first music video for a new song called \\"Hobbit Feet\\", directed by artist Gris Grimly. Released on the same day as the North American premiere of the film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the song and video revolves around singer Mike Odd taking a sexy woman home from a bar, only to discover she has large, hairy \\"Hobbit feet\\". In an interview with L.A. Record, Odd claimed to have received over one hundred pieces of hate mail from angry Tolkien fans upset with the video's sexualized portrayal of Hobbits, in particular a scene where Odd sensually licks spray cheese off a prosthetic Hobbit foot. The same year, Odd starred in the music video for The Radioactive Chicken Heads' song \\"Headless Mike\\", based on the 1940s carnival attraction Mike the Headless Chicken. ;Current status and future plans As of 2017, Rosemary's Billygoat continue to play shows in the Southern California area, often performing alongside their shock rock colleagues like Haunted Garage and The Radioactive Chicken Heads or playing more offbeat events such as opening for the Los Angeles production of Re-Animator: The Musical. Since 2011, Odd has frequently talked about plans to eventually release a fourth Rosemary's Billygoat studio album, tentatively titled Psychobillygoat. In a 2017 interview, Odd revealed that the album had actually been recorded for several years, though the band ultimately lacked the means of releasing it, with Odd expressing a desire to press it on 12\\" vinyl instead of through digital means. Although Rosemary's Billygoat play many of Psychobillygoats \\"new\\" songs live, Odd states that the actual album has become \\"a running joke that it's the album that will never happen\\". The Rosemary's Billygoat Odditorium Outside of his work with Rosemary's Billygoat, vocalist Mike Odd has been involved with numerous ventures and endeavors, musical and otherwise. From 2004 to 2007, Odd operated The Rosemary's Billygoat Odditorium on Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake, a curios store which sold strange and bizarre artwork, furnishings and trinkets, and regularly hosted small-scale concerts and performances. Following the store's closing, Odd moved his business to the internet, where he continues to sell horror-themed clothing, art and furnishings, as well as through his company Monster Buckles, which makes custom horror and band-themed belt buckles. In 2012, Mike Odd hosted the comedic stage show \\"Dr. Odd's Medicine Show\\" at Knott's Scary Farm, a seasonal Halloween event at the Buena Park theme park Knott's Berry Farm, where he performed over 100 shows alongside Zamora the Torture King. As \\"Dr. Odd\\", Odd also hosted the accompanying DVD for Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson guitarist John 5s 2012 solo album God Told Me To, and has adapted his show as a solo act which he has performed at various venues and events in the Los Angeles area. In the mid-2000s, Mike Odd formed an industrial side project called Blood Pharm with former Flogging Molly guitarist John Donovan, releasing a self-titled album. In 2005, Odd, as \\"Mike Odd & the Oddities\\", contributed a cover of \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovics \\"Nature Trail to Hell\\" for the compilation Mr. Snail's Halloween Party on Snail Sounds Records, the label operated by The Radioactive Chicken Heads. Since 2014, Odd also acts as manager and spokesperson for the heavy metal parody band Mac Sabbath.

Roster } Schedule Schedule Game summaries =@ USC= Matt Barkley threw three touchdowns to Robert Woods as the Trojans won their 14th straight season opener. Barkley went 34-of-45 with 304 yards while Woods caught 17 passes, a USC single-game record, for 177 yards in the win. D.J. Morgan added 18 carries for 70 yards in the win for USC. Duane Bennett ran for a touchdown while Max Shortell threw for a touchdown but was intercepted on the final drive for the Golden Gophers, who failed to win in the debut of new head coach Jerry Kill. Bennett finished with 53 yards on 15 carries while MarQueis Gray went 7-of-12 with 94 yards and added 48 yards on 16 carries for Minnesota, which went just 3‚Äì9 last season. The Gophers never led in the game, but made it a one-score possession with 8:03 to play when Shortell hit Brandon Green on a short pass to the left and the receiver curled around his defender and into the end zone from 12 yards out to make it 19‚Äì17. Minnesota got the ball back at its own nine-yard line with just over two minutes to play. However, the drive only made it to the Minnesota 28 and on 3rd-and-1 Shortell was picked off by Torin Harris and the Trojans killed off the rest of the clock.https://www.sbnation.com/ncaa- football/events/76365/recap?article_id=162277 =vs. New Mexico State= Aside from losing the game 28‚Äì21, this game represented a scare for Minnesota outside of the game itself as head coach Jerry Kill had a seizure with 20 seconds left in the game and was taken away by ambulance. Kill was stabilized, and Minnesota's team physician said the coach's condition was not life- threatening. Kill has had similar episodes three times before in his career, but never missed a game, and his assistants said they weren't worried. Regarding the game, the Aggies set the tone from the start with a six-play, 60-yard drive. Manley hit Rogers for a 26-yard score, with cornerback Brock Vereen and safety Shady Salamon failing to reach Rogers in time. Manley had help from Robert Clay, who rushed 20 times for 97 yards and a touchdown. Taveon Rogers had 88 yards receiving and two scores. MarQueis Gray had another uneven performance at quarterback for the Gophers, who hadn't lost their first two games to start a season since 1992. Da'Jon McKnight made a handful of acrobatic catches, finishing with 146 yards and one touchdown, and tight end Colin McGarry dived to haul in a 10-yard score in the corner of the end zone and pull the Gophers within 21‚Äì14 right before the half. Gray, who was relieved in the third quarter by freshman Max Shortell because he had cramps on a hot day, finished with 110 yards rushing on 17 attempts. He went 16 for 32 through the air for 211 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Gray threaded a perfect pass to McKnight on a quick post route for a 4-yard touchdown with 11:47 left, pulling the Gophers within 28‚Äì21. He nearly tied the game later on a rollout with a head-first dive at the pylon with 7:51 left, and the initial ruling on the field was a touchdown. But a replay review determined his foot was out of bounds. On fourth and 1, Edwards was stopped and NMSU took over. Clay and Victor Johnson ground down the clock for the Aggies, and the Gophers didn't get the ball back until 2:09 remained, starting at their own 11-yard line with no timeouts.

Planning The aim of the operation was to reclaim the strategic southern province of Kandahar, which was the birthplace of the Taliban movement. The area where the operation took place has been dubbed \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" by Coalition troops. The basic concept of the coalition operation, code-named Dragon Strike, was a series of sequential, mutually reinforcing attacks across the entire district to seize control of key nodes and movement corridors in the enemy system, and destroy enemy strongholds and IED and weapons facilitation networks. By advancing simultaneously across the district, ISAF and ANSF forced the Taliban to simultaneously defend multiple positions. Most importantly, ISAF for the first time moved into Zhari with the intention and resources to hold key terrain and to work with the local population to prevent insurgent re-infiltration. Battles The first in a series of decisive attacks across the entire district began in the early morning hours of September 15, 2010. But in the months preceding Dragon Strike, Afghan and coalition special forces had conducted shaping operations in Zhari. Many of these were kill or capture operations against insurgent leadership in Zhari,.which successfully removed numerous Taliban commanders, IEDcell leaders, and facilitators.195 Successful targeted missions continued while ISAF battle-space owners advanced through the district. In mid-October 2010, ISAF killed both of the Taliban's field commanders for Zhari, Kaka Abdul Khaliq and his deputy Kako. The main force leading the operation were units from the 101st Airborne Division. Some of the heaviest of the fighting during the operation had been in the Zhari District, which is on the main highway to Kandahar and a major insurgent supply route into the city, the Arghandab District and the Panjwaye District.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/27/eveningnews/main6905761.shtml By the end of December 2010, the operation's main objectives had been accomplished. The majority of Taliban forces in Kandahar had withdrawn from the province,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/asia/16south.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 and much of their leadership was said to have been fractured.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/22/us-military-make- taliban-flee The operation has also drawn large criticism from the local civilian population because of claims of heavy-handed tactics by the U.S. military. During October, U.S. troops destroyed hundreds of Afghan civilian homes, farm houses, walls, trees and plowed through fields and buildings using explosives, bulldozers, aerial bombardment and rocketry in Zhari, Punjwayi and Arghandab districts. Photographs revealed one village, Tarok Kolache, to have been totally destroyed by aerial bombing, while several other villages including Khosrow Sofla, Khosrow Ulya, and Lower Babur were reported destroyed by journalists working in the area. The governor of Arghandab District reported additional villages to have been destroyed.Norland, Rod and Taimoor Shah: NATO is Razing Booby-Trapped Afghan Homes. The New York Times, 16 November 2010. Lt. Col. David Flynn told reporters that villagers knew the locations of IEDs, and were given the option of removing them to prevent their villages from being destroyed. Military officials later stated that most of the farms, orchards and buildings destroyed had been booby-trapped by the Taliban. Also, they argued that the destruction was positive in that it would force Afghan residents to go to their local government center for compensation, seeing this as a way to connect the civilian population to the Afghan government.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/10/world/main7040897.shtml In late December, the civilians, displaced by the fighting, had started to go back to their homes only to find them destroyed.http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2039748,00.html The damages caused by Coalition troops to civilian property were estimated to be more than 100 million dollars by two separate bodies within the Afghan government.https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70A3B620110111 Of that sum, Coalition forces agreed to pay approximately 5 million.King, Laura: United States Rebuilds Where It Destroyed.

It was a low-wing monoplane with two seats in tandem and a fixed conventional undercarriage. Design The IAR.22 was a wooden, low-wing monoplane with a fixed conventional undercarriage, seating two in tandem, open cockpits. The wings were built around two spruce box spars, with plywood webs; plywood covered the whole wing except for the fabric trailing edges. In plan, the wings were straight-tapered, with most of the taper on the trailing edge, but with rounded tips. The wing trailing edge carried ailerons but no flaps. The tailplane was also straight-tapered, though with the taper more equally distributed between leading and trailing edges. The elevators were split, with a cut-out for rudder movement, and were horn balanced. The fin was also straight-edged but the broad rudder, also horn balanced, had a curved trailing edge. The fuselage of the IAR.22 was flat sided, tapering to the rear. It was a Warren truss structure with duralumin gussets; the forward fuselage was plywood covered, the remain fabric clad. Rounded decking, together with a head fairing behind the rear cockpit, gave the aircraft a slightly humped profile. The front cockpit was just behind the leading edge of the wing and the rear one at mid-chord. The nose line dropped slightly over the cowling of the 97 kW (130 hp) de Havilland Gipsy Major engine, an inverted air-cooled inline engine carried on a steel mounting and which drove a two-bladed propeller. The undercarriage had a wide track of over 2.5 m (100 in), with near perpendicular IAR-made shock absorber legs, split axles hinged at the fuselage centre line and trailing struts. The wheels had independent brakes but were not faired in. It was reported that the IAR.22 \\"gave very satisfactory results in tests\\" conducted by the Romanian Air Ministry's Acceptance Commission but there is no record of its adoption by the Romanian Air Force. The design allowed for engines of up to 225 kW (300 hp) to be fitted: the intention was that it should be suitable for wireless, camera and gunnery training.

The album was produced by Supernafamacho and Jotamay√∫scula which had worked before with La Mala Rodr√≠guez. This album included numerous collaborations included Mr. T-Cee and Raimundo Amador. 69/5000 This album was certified as gold after selling more than 50,000 copies. Reception The AllMusic review by Jason Birchmeier awarded the album 3 stars stating \\"As a rapper, Rodr√≠guez has noticeably matured in the three years since Lujo Ib√©rico, sounding more confident and laid-back in her delivery and coming up with darker rhymes that are more streetwise and far more hardcore than last time. If anything, the critical acclaim of Lujo Ib√©rico seems to have hardened Rodr√≠guez and turned her away from the commercial mainstream. Take for instance the lead single \\"La Ni√±a,\\" a grim song about a young girl who grows up on the margins of society in a barrio filled with drugs, crime, and shattered dreams. Fodder for the pop charts it's not. Unfortunately, Rodr√≠guez is joined by a long list of featured guests on Alevos√≠a. Eight of the 14 tracks feature one or more guests, a Spanish hardcore rap rogue's gallery that most notably includes Giggi Montecquiggia, Kultama, and Kamikaze. These guest rappers, most of them obscure and all of them inferior to Rodr√≠guez, tarnish Alevos√≠a greatly. If not for the onslaught of guest features, Alevos√≠a would be a first-rate album. Rodr√≠guez's raps are peerless, and the production work of May√∫scula, Supernafamacho, and Sr. Tcee is spellbinding. If you can overlook the guest features, there are a lot of highlights besides \\"La Ni√±a,\\" among them \\"Lo F√°cil Cae Ligero,\\" \\"En la Hoguera,\\" \\"Jugadoras, Jugadores,\\" and \\"Una Raya en el Agua,\\" the latter notable for its touches of flamenco. \\".Birchmeier, J.

In December 2010, it was announced that it was a new discovery and determined to be vulnerable to extinction. Description Helixanthera schizocalyx is a relative of the European and North American varieties of mistletoe. It is closely related to Helixanthera verruculosa, a species known only from the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Helixanthera schizocalyx has been found attached to the branches of stunted trees such as the Psychotria zombamontana of the coffee family that grow where wet montane forests give way to bare granite peaks at the summit of Mount Mabu. Helixanthera schizocalyx, which reaches a height of 50 cm, is hairless and parasitic. Its leaves are in opposite pairs and are thin and elliptic in shape. Mature flowers have not been observed, and senior research botanist at Kew, Bill Baker, said that berries have not yet been observed either. Five specimens have been collected as of December 2010. The genus Helixanthera is apparently notable within the loranths in that most species seem to have flowers pollinated by insects, as opposed to birds. Discovery Helixanthera schizocalyx was discovered in 2008 by East African butterfly specialist Colin Congdon in dense foliage on Mount Mabu in northern Mozambique. (Lepidopterists look for loranth species which support specialized butterfly species.) Congdon, who was part of a conservation and biodiversity research team from Kew, noticed that the plant was unlike any he knew from the mountains in Malawi and Tanzania. In December 2010, scientists at Kew confirmed that it was a new species and that it is globally threatened and vulnerable to extinction because of its limited distribution. Helixanthera schizocalyx is listed at the top of Kew's \\"botanical discoveries of 2010\\" list.

He served in the RAF as part of No. 609 Squadron West Riding of Yorkshire Squadron RAF. He was killed in action on 15 September 1940. Gaunt was from a well-known textile family and screen star James Mason was a cousin. He was buried in his family plot at Salendine Nook Baptist Church with his grandparents and later his father was also buried there in 1958. He was good friends with David Moore Crook. Geoffrey Norman Gaunt served with 609 Squadron Auxiliary Air Force before the war and received some flying training with the unit. He was commissioned into the Auxiliary Air Force in April 1940 and completed his training at the Flying Training School at Cranwell, Lincolnshire in June and July 1940. Gaunt then went to 7 Operational Training Unit at Hawarden, near RAF Sealand, in the North Wales-Chester area. After converting to Spitfire Mark Ones there, Geoffrey Gaunt rejoined 609 Spitfire Squadron on 16 August 1940 at Warmwell in Dorset, close to Weymouth, for the protection of Portland Naval Base and places from Bristol, Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. Earlier, in May 1940 609 West Riding squadron flew sorties in support of Operation Dynamo - the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk during the Battle of France. One-third of the squadron's pilots were lost during a three-day period. In the Battle of Britain, which started in July 1940, the squadron operated from Middle Wallop, with half the squadron operating from the forward base at Warmwell in Dorset. During August 1940, the squadron destroyed 46 enemy aircraft but nearly all the pre-war auxiliary pilots were lost, either killed or missing. In October 1940, 609 became the first squadron to achieve 100 confirmed aerial victories. Geoffrey Gaunt had rejoined 609 Squadron on 16 August and got into many combats through the month. He shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt BF110 fighter on 25 August which was shared Destroyed with P/O Noel Agazarian, who was later a Battle of Britain fighter ace. Geoffrey Gaunt was killed on 15 September 1940 when he was shot down during an attack on German bombers over London. His Spitfire, R6690, crashed and burned out near Kenley. This day was later known as \\"Battle of Britain Day\\" as the continued strength of the RAF fighter defence decided Hitler to postpone and then cancel his planned invasion of Britain. David Crook wrote a book titled Spitfire Pilot, published by Faber and Faber in 1942, which describes his friends including Geoffrey Gaunt who were killed, one by one as the Battle of Britain carried on through 1940. The book immortalizes these men and Crook also, for he was to die along with his friends in wartime. These included: Geoffrey Gaunt, Noel Agazarian, John Dundas, and Phillip \\"Pip\\" Barran. # A Spitfire flown by \\"Aggy\\" Agazarian and pilots including David More Crook, John Dundas, (also killed, like Agazarian and Crook in wartime) hangs today in the Imperial War Museum at Lambeth, London. # A Memorial Hut to 609 West Riding squadron, complete with a replica Spitfire, a series of wartime portraits of these pilots, relics and memorabilia is at Elvington Airfield for the Yorkshire Air Museum, near York, in tribute to these men like Geoffrey Gaunt who were killed in wartime.

This replacement happened because of the new Microsoft Zune player's feature: which allows listeners to hear HD stations as well as their MP3s, but, turns out, won't be able to tune into the AM dials. So, in order to make sure KRLD 1080's news feed still got out to the ever-evolving listenership, CBS bumped The Indie-Verse in order to make room.

Commissioned in 1987 and installed the following year, the work consists of a stainless steel abstract form atop a red brick base, to which a placard is affixed. The total size of the piece is approximately Description Guido Brink's artwork outside the Fire Engine Company #29 of the Milwaukee Fire Department is an abstract sculpture in polished stainless steel placed atop a red brick base. It depicts \\"jets of water piercing and being repelled by a shield.\\" The sculpture's stainless steel portion is approximately in height, and the brick is high. A inscription on the brass plate attached to the brick base reads: Historical information Deflected Jets won the 1987 City of Milwaukee Art Commission competition, and was unveiled by Mayor Henry N. Maier on January 1988. and was funded by a Percent for Art program. Many of the Percent for Art works that have been placed outside fire stations have been met with little enthusiasm from the firefighters as the depictions of the firefighters' work are seen as overly realistic. Brink's piece is an exception. According to Diane Buck, \\"Deflected Jets lyrically captures the spirit of a firefighter's commitment to the community. By creating a highly polished stainless steel sculpture of a shield and jets, which represent the water used by the firefighters and the courage they display, the artist gives the public the best in artistic imagination and craftsmanship.\\" Artist Brink was born in D√ºsseldorf in 1913, and worked at his uncle's stained glass studio after emigrating to Wisconsin in 1913. After a semester at Columbia University (1931) and a three- year apprenticeship, he attended the State Academy of Fine Arts in D√ºsseldorf from 1934-39. Here he was very inspired by the work of Paul Klee. Being drafted immediately upon graduation, Brink fought on the Russian and Italian fronts (1940-45). After the war ended, Brink became a landscape painter and emigrated to New York City with his wife Ello; he spent 1952 studying with a fellowship at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts Matiers d'Art in Paris. Shortly after, they moved to Milwaukee for Brink to pursue stained glass work. Here he worked at Conrad Schmitt Studios, and eventually became a faculty member of the Layton School of Art. When the school closed in 1974, Brink delved into three-dimensional work, taking advantage of Milwaukee's great wealth of fabricating and manufacturing plants. He became an artist in residence at Super Steel Products Corporation, and would stay there for more than 20 years. \\"His works seem to be influenced by the experience of growing up between two world wars in the battlegrounds of Europe. He sought mental equilibrium in torn world.\\"Levy, Hannah Heidi, Famous Wisconsin Artists and Architects, 2004.

With the launch of Channel Five in 1997 he moved from News at Ten to become programme editor of Five News, but returned to ITV in 1999 as senior programme editor for ITV Evening News. He moved to Channel Four News in 2002, but once again returned to ITV News the following year when he was appointed as Head of Output. He was later promoted to Head of Network News Programming. Oliver joined the BBC in 2006, where he became editor of BBC One's Ten O'Clock News, He was also editor of the channel's Six O'Clock News.

The passage of the resolution created the United Nations' 17th active peacekeeping mission. The vote on the resolution primarily concerning South Sudan was delayed by three weeks due to disagreements over the situation in nearby Darfur. Observations The Security Council welcomed the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in January 2005 by the Sudanese government and Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. The parties were urged to bring about peace and stability in Darfur and prevent further violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and end impunity. Such violations of human rights and of the ceasefire were condemned. The preamble of the resolution also expressed concern about the humanitarian situation and the safety of humanitarian aid workers. It was alarmed at the continuing violence in Darfur and noted that the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement had requested the presence of a peacekeeping mission. The Council considered the situation to be a threat to international peace and security. Acts The Security Council decided to establish UNMIS for an initial period of six months, with 10,000 military and 715 police personnel. It was instructed to co-operate with the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and had the following mandate: :(a) support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; :(b) facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and with the return of refugees and internally displaced persons; :(c) assist in demining efforts; :(d) contribute towards the protection of human rights and the protection of civilians. The parties were urged to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of UNMIS and humanitarian personnel, further emphasising that there could be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to transfer responsibilities from the United Nations Advance Mission in Sudan (UNAMIS) to UNMIS, and to keep the Council regularly informed on developments. The resolution demanded strict adherence to the zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation. Furthermore, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, UNMIS was authorised to use force if necessary to protect personnel, civilians and facilities during the course of its mandate. The Council also asked for an increase in the deployment of human rights monitors to the Darfur region.

Producer Bill Lichtenstein in Oklahoma during production of \\"Throwaway Kids\\" for ABC News 20/20, 1981. The main focus of the reports were the state's \\"warehousing\\" of children, many of whom were in state custody for being abused or abandoned. In turn, the state received per diem federal funds for each child in its custody, but it failed to provide appropriate services for the children with the revenue. At the time of the program, Oklahoma had no foster care system, so children who were abandoned, abused, neglected, or in need of supervision, were placed in large, outmoded, state-run institutions, many of which were located in rural towns of the state, and were without services or proper care. Lichtenstein and Burnes obtained thousands of pages of confidential \\"Abuse Reports,\\" generated by state workers and kept by the Department of Human Services, detailing the mistreatment of children in state's custody, ranging from children being beaten by often unqualified staff, to kids being locked in isolation for weeks at a time. There were also numerous unexplained deaths at the state hospital for children with mental retardation, which the investigation showed were the result of neglect and abuse by state workers. Burnes and Lichtenstein were part of a team of reporters who collaborated on the investigation, which included ABC's Sylvia Chase, Pulitzer Prize-winners John Hanchette and Carlton Sherwood of Gannett News Service, and the investigative team from local TV station KOCO, which was an ABC affiliate and was owned by Gannett. This unprecedented investigation, involving national and local broadcast and print reporters, culminated with articles published by Gannett, a special two-part report on 20/20, \\"Throwaway Kids,\\" produced by Burnes and Lichtenstein, and a series, \\"Oklahoma Shame,\\" which aired locally in Oklahoma City on KOCO-TV. The series was honored with a 1982 Peabody Award and a National Headliner Award, and was nominated for a national news Emmy Award. In 1982, only months after the reports ran, Lloyd E. Rader, Sr., the director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, resigned after 31 years with the department amidst a state investigation of financial misconduct involving patronage, illegal corporate hirings and abuse of the state bid system. In particular, Rader was accused of using state funds to hire private detectives to follow and harass the reporters investigating the Department of Human Services, and that he had used state workers to build a clinic for his son, Lloyd Rader, Jr., a doctor.

Resolution =Observations= The preamble of the resolution reflected the Council's concern at ongoing hostilities in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. It reaffirmed that all parties involved in the conflict were responsible for the safety of civilians in the region. The transitional government was urged to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Council noted that the presence of former Rwandan troops and Interahamwe in Congolese territory remained a threat to the local population and on relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. It recalled its condemnation of an attack by militia on MONUC forces in February 2005 and welcomed steps to bring the perpetrators to justice. Furthermore, the resolution condemned the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the country, which was fuelling the conflict. =Acts= Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended MONUC's mandate with the intention of renewing it for further periods. All parties were urged to co-operate with MONUC by allowing it unhindered access and guaranteeing the safety of its personnel. The transitional government was called upon to protect civilians and humanitarian personnel by extending its authority throughout the country, particularly in North and South Kivu and Ituri Province. Furthermore, it had to reform the security sector and make progress towards the holding of elections. Meanwhile, the resolution demanded that the governments of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo put a stop to the use of their respective territories in support of violations of the arms embargo imposed by Resolution 1493 (2003), and for neighbouring states to hinder support for illegal exploitation of Congolese natural resources. It emphasised that MONUC could use necessary measures, including 'cordon-and-search' powers against armed groups thought to be threatening the population. The Security Council expressed concern about acts of sexual exploitation and abuse carried out by United Nations personnel against the local population and called on the Secretary-General Kofi Annan and troop-contributing countries to urgently address the issue.

Plants Land plants maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of an outer waterproof layer. In soft or green tissues, this is usually a waxy cuticle over the outer epidermis. In older, woody tissues, waterproofing chemicals are present in the secondary cell wall that limit or inhibit the flow of water. Vascular plants also possess an internal vascular system that distributes fluids throughout the plant. Some xerophytes, such as cacti and other desert plants, have mucilage in their tissues. This is a sticky substance that holds water within the plant, reducing the rate of dehydration. Some seeds and spores remain dormant until adequate moisture is present, at which time the seed or spore begins to germinate. Animals Animals maintain adequate tissue hydration by means of (1) an outer skin, shell, or cuticle; (2) a fluid-filled coelom cavity; and (3) a circulatory system. Hydration of fat free tissues, ratio of total body water to fat free body mass, is stable at 0.73 in mammals. In humans, a significant drop in tissue hydration can lead to the medical condition of dehydration. This may result from loss of water itself, loss of electrolytes, or a loss of blood plasma. Administration of hydrational fluids as part of sound dehydration management is necessary to avoid severe complications, and in some cases, death. Some invertebrates are able to survive extreme desiccation of their tissues by entering a state of cryptobiosis.

He became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982, and Academy Professor in 2004. He supervised 25 PhD students. Duistermaat worked in many different areas of mathematics: classical mechanics, symplectic geometry, Fourier integral operators, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and dynamical systems. Apart from roughly 50 articles in refereed international journals, he has (co-)written 11 books. Among his best known research are his article with Victor Guillemin on spectra of elliptic operators and periodic bicharacteristics, his article with Gert Heckman on the Duistermaat‚ÄìHeckman formula, and his article with Alberto Gr√ºnbaum on the bispectral problem.

He recalled that the module Treasure Hunt, \\"a much more linear and predictable scenario than these two adventures\\" has a two-page appendix entitled \\"If Things Go Wrong\\", and felt that sort of commentary and advice would be even more critical in open-ended settings like Arena of Thyatis and Legions of Thyatis. He felt that \\"the ancient Roman city\\" of Thyatis \\"doesn't mix comfortably with heroic, D&D-game;, action-adventure role-playing\\", and noted that the impact of spell-casters doesn't seem to have been considered. Rolston concluded the review by stating: \\"My first response was impatient and unforgiving; only my persistence in trying to appreciate Nephew's good intentions gave me a reserved affection for the most appealing features of these modules. Give them a split grade: four stars for originality, charm, role-playing potential, and right-mindedness, and two stars for quality of DM staging, plot support, and suitability for D&D-game-style; play. I do not recommend them for beginning DMs, but as an earnest and moderately successful approach to designing a module for open-ended, improvisational role-playing for the D&D; game, they may inspire you to experiment with this difficult but rewarding style of FRPG adventure.\\" References Dungeons & Dragons modules Mystara ","title":"Legions of Thyatis"},{"id":"30133502","text":"The Shadow Elves is an accessory for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role- playing game.

Career After receiving his bachelor's degree in architecture from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1929, Mr. Woolf (known as Jack) moved to Hollywood, hoping to pursue a career in film. Hoping his Southern background might prove an asset in filming Gone with the Wind, he met the film's first director, George Cukor, who was instrumental in helping Woolf meet other influential people in Hollywood who later became his clients. In the late 1940s, Woolf met Robert Koch, an interior designer. They became partners and together built or renovated homes for many of the wealthy and famous Los Angeles area residents of the 1950s and 1960s. > They \\"established a new vocabulary for glamorous movie-star living; they > synthesized 19th-century French, Greek Revival and Modernist touches into a > heady mixture that has since been christened Hollywood Regency, which > foreshadowed aspects of postmodernism.\\" One of their most notable renovations was Case Study House No. 17, the largest and most technology-enhanced of the Case Study Houses sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine, designed by Craig Ellwood and originally built in 1955.http://en.wikiarquitectura.com/index.php?title=Hoffman_House_/_Case_Study_House_n%C2%BA_17 Woolf and Koch purchased the house in 1962 and transformed it from its original utilitarian design to their own more glamorous architectural style, which they used for their own residence. Legacy Woolf designed homes for clients Cary Grant, Errol Flynn, Judy Garland, Barbara Stanwyck, Ira Gershwin, Fanny Brice, Bob Hope, Agnes Moorehead, Ronald Colman, Jean Howard, Lillian Gish, Mervyn LeRoy, Paul Lynde, Ray Milland, Ricardo Montalb√°n, Loretta Young, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

Additionally, many Hollywood builders of the same era imitated the style created by Woolf, which typically featured his \\"Pullman doors\\" front entry, leaded oval glass window, mansard roofline and Doric columns. Family Robert Koch Woolf was Jack's partner and lover. In 1971, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, Woolf adopted Koch and Gene Oney Woolf, who had come to reside with them, in order to legalize their relationship and formally establish a family. A later household member, William Capp, was included as a \\"brother,\\" although never formally adopted.

In her youth she was regarded as a great beauty, and was known for assembling a wardrobe of rare and valuable classic haute couture items. She traveled widely and was married four times. She bought a 700-acre estate in County Kildare, Ireland, where she became one of Ireland's first female horsebreeders. Early life Bullitt's mother was Louise Bryant, best known for writing, as a witness to the founding of the Soviet Union, where she had traveled with her second husband John Silas Reed. Her father was an independently wealthy diplomat William C. Bullitt Jr., who had been in Russia at the time of the founding of the Soviet Union, as an unofficial observer for President Woodrow Wilson. The pair married in 1924, four years after Reed died of typhus in the Soviet Union, weeks before Anne Moen's birth. Bullitt had almost no contact with her mother, as her father had divorced her when Anne was an infant, claiming she was an alcoholic and unfit mother. Accounts said young Anne followed her father everywhere, including on his diplomatic missions, and that he allowed her to hide, and listen, when he had meetings with other VIPs. Legacy =Fashion legacy= From Anne Moen Bullitt's wardrobe; Christian Dior by Yves Saint Laurent \\"Zou Zou\\" Suit, S/S 1958. Adnan Ege Kutay Collection According to Decades magazine she was a great beauty. Decades magazine wrote she had an 18-inch waist, paired with a generous bosom. When her estate auctioned her extensive wardrobe of high- fashion items, at Christie's in 2009, the Irish Independent reported she had a 20-inch waist and an hourglass figure. =Parents' papers= Bullitt, and her advisors, donated the papers of her famous parents to Yale University, her father's alma mater, and she helped clarify some aspects of their lives. Her father was an early friend and supporter of pioneering psychotherapist Sigmund Freud, and he published a controversial book analyzing Woodrow Wilson, titled Thomas Woodrow Wilson ‚Äì A Psychological Study. According to the New York Daily News, after Freud heard Bullitt declare she was so devoted to her father, she looked upon him as her god, he replied: \\"You know, I have developed a theory that male children's first love is their mother, and females', the father. But this is the first time a child has confirmed my theory.\\" =Palmerston House and Stud= Bullitt's health failed in her old age. Her vision deteriorated to the point that she lived in just three rooms of her stately Irish home. In 2000, after she agreed to sell her estate to Jim Mansfield, surprising her financial advisors, who had recommended a different buyer. In 2000, they had her declared a ward of court. In 2009, Bullitt's estate sued firms owned by Mansfield. Representatives claimed that a deposit he promised for the property that was supposed to be held in trust, and paid when the sale was completed, had been deposited with a company he owned, and never was paid. Her estate claimed that personal possession of Bullitt were improperly in the possession of Mansfield, including valuable works of art by Pablo Picasso and pistols once owned by George Washington.

The procedure gets its name from its use of the Newtonian laws of the dynamics, or motion, of asteroids as they move around the Solar System. The procedure works by taking multiple position measurements to determine the gravitational deflection caused when two or more asteroids move past each other. The method relies on the fact that the large number of known asteroids means they will occasionally move past one another at very close distances. If at least one of the two interacting bodies is large enough, its gravitational influence on the other can reveal its mass. The accuracy of the determined mass is limited by the precision and timing of the appropriate astrometric observations being made to determine the gravitational deflection caused by a given interaction. Because the method relies on detecting the amount of gravitational deflection induced during an interaction, the procedure works best for objects which will produce a large deflection in their interactions with other objects. This means that the procedure works best for large objects, but it can also be effectively applied to objects which have repeated close interactions with each other such as when the two objects are in orbital resonance with one another. Regardless of the mass of the interacting objects, the amount of deflection will be greater if the objects approach nearer to each other and it will also be greater if the objects pass slowly, allowing more time for gravity to perturb the orbits of the two objects. For large enough asteroids this distance can be as large as ~0.1 AU, for less massive asteroids the conditions of the interaction would need to be correspondingly better.  Mathematical analysis  The simplest way to describe the deflection of the asteroids is in the case where one object is significantly more massive than the other. In this case the equations of motion are the same as for that of Rutherford scattering between oppositely charged objects (so that the force is attractive rather than repulsive). When rewritten in the more familiar notation used in celestial mechanics deflection angle can be related to the eccentricity of the hyperbolic orbit of the smaller object relative to the larger one by the following formula: :sin left( frac{Theta}{2} right) = frac{1}{epsilon} Here Theta is the angle between the asymptotes of the hyperbolic orbit of the small object relative to the large one, and epsilon is the eccentricity of this orbit (which must be greater than 1 for a hyperbolic orbit). A more sophisticated description using matrices can be achieved by separating the observed objects position on the sky as a function of time into the sum of two components: one which is a result of the relative motion of the objects themselves, and the other the motion induced by the gravitational influence of the two bodies. The relative contributions of the two terms in the best fit of this equation onto the actual observations of the objects yields the objects masses.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman for the Chicago White Sox, Washington Senators and Boston Braves. In a four-year major league career, Shires played in 290 games, accumulating 287 hits in 986 at bats for a .291 career batting average along with 11 home runs, 119 runs batted in, an on-base percentage of .347, and a .988 fielding percentage. Shires was a colorful personality with a penchant for self-praise, earning himself the nickname \\"Art The Great\\". Early life Art Shires was born on August 13, 1906 to Josh and Sallee Shires. He was one of nine children; his brother, Leonard, played professional baseball for nine seasons. He attended Waxahachie High School and played for the school's baseball team. While still in high school, he first tried out for the Washington Senators, who chose not to sign him, before beginning his professional career in Texas after graduation. Shires began his professional baseball career in 1926 at the age of 19 with the Waco Cubs of the Texas League. In 1928 he had a .387 batting average with 11 home runs in 108 games for Waco and, on July 31, his contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox. MLB career Shires made his major league debut with the White Sox on August 20, 1928 at the age of 21, delivering four hits in five at-bats off of future Hall of Fame pitcher, Red Ruffing. He replaced Bud Clancy as the starting first baseman and ended the season with a .341 average in 33 games that year. On December 28, 1928 a 53-year-old man from Shreveport, Louisiana died from head injuries after being hit by a baseball thrown by Shires on May 20, 1928 in a game between Waco and Shreveport. Shires had allegedly thrown the baseball in anger at a group of disapproving Shreveport fans. On March 27, 1929, Shires was sued by the dead man's wife for $25,411. One day after the lawsuit was reported in the papers, Shires was exonerated by a grand jury on March 29, 1929. The suit was dropped after an agreed judgment for $500 on January 11, 1930. White Sox manager Lena Blackburne named Shires to be the team captain before the 1929 season, succeeding third baseman Willie Kamm who asked to step down from the role to concentrate on his hitting. Only two weeks later, Blackburne stripped him of his captain's role and sent him home from spring training, due to his being out of shape as well as keeping late hours and breaking training rules. Shires made national news in May 1929 when he gave Blackburne a black eye during a fist fight and was suspended from the team. One week later, a contrite Shires apologized to Blackburne and was reinstated. Shires' troubles with Blackburne had him reduced to a part-time role with an occasional pinch hitting assignment. He eventually regained his role as a starting player when Clancy was injured in late June. On September 14, the two men fought again when Blackburne tried to reprimand Shires for breaking team rules, resulting in Shires' third suspension of the season. Although it was thought that Shires might lose his job over the altercation, it was Blackburne who would lose his job at the end of the season. Shires ended the season with a .312 batting average along with 3 home runs and 41 runs batted in. In December 1929, Shires tried his hand at boxing, taking 21 seconds to knockout an unknown fighter named Dan Daly. Shires entered the arena wearing a robe with the words \\"Arthur The Great Shires\\" printed on back. It was reported on December 14 that Chicago Cubs player Hack Wilson signed a contract to meet Shires in the ring in January. On December 18, Shires' boxing career suffered a setback when he lost a bout to Chicago Bears football player George Trafton. Seeing no benefit in fighting a defeated boxer, Wilson backed out of his proposed bout with Shires. In late December, Shires was suspended by the Michigan State Boxing Commission and the National Boxing Association after his boxing manager was alleged to have offered money to a future Shires opponent to lose a fight on purpose. Soon after that revelation, Dan Daly admitted to the Illinois State Boxing Commission that he too had lost his fight to Shires on purpose. Shires was eventually cleared from any wrongdoing by the boxing commissions after no evidence was found that he had fixed the fights. In January , Shires defeated Boston Braves player Al Spohrer in four rounds by technical knockout at the Boston Garden. There was a move made to have Shires fight Boston Bruins hockey player, Eddie Shore, who was well known for his fighting skills, having set a single-season record for penalty minutes in 1928, however, in the wake of his previous bouts, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ruled that any baseball player engaging in boxing matches could consider himself retired from baseball, thus putting a stop to Shires' fighting career. Although Shires was still suspended from the White Sox after his altercation with Blackburne, he had the audacity to demand a contract for $25,000. When White Sox owner Charles Comiskey failed to meet this demand, an angered Shires threatened to quit baseball. Eventually, he relented and signed a contract for $7,500 and rejoined the team. Having worn out his welcome with the White Sox, Shires was hitting for a .258 average in June 1930 when he was traded to the Washington Senators. After the trade, Shires hit for a .369 average in 38 games for the Senators. The Senators already had two first basemen in Joe Judge and Joe Kuhel and, when reports surfaced that Shires was complaining about being a reserve player and that his work ethic was lacking, Senators owner Clark Griffith sold Shires to the minor league Milwaukee Brewers for a reported $10,000 in November 1930. With typical bombast, Shires claimed that he was too good a player to be sitting on a major league bench and predicted that he would hit, \\"around .350\\" for Milwaukee. In December 1930, Shires was arrested in Hollywood, California on charges of drunkenness and carrying concealed weapons. The arrest was accompanied by Shires bragging that he had succumbed to movie offers. Shires proceeded to back up his claims with the Brewers in , posting a .384 average with 11 home runs in 157 games, winning the American Association batting championship. His performance earned him a return to the major leagues when the Brewers traded him to the Boston Braves for Al Bool and $10,000 on November 9, 1931. Ironically, Shires' roommate with the Braves was his former boxing foe, Al Spohrer. On April 22, 1932, Shires suffered a torn ligament in a collision with baserunner Joe Stripp. When he returned from the injury, he failed to live up to expectations, producing just a .238 batting average. In August , Shires was fired by Braves manager Bill McKechnie after he objected to plans to be sent back to the minor leagues. Shires eventually returned to the minor leagues and played for the Rochester Red Wings and the Columbus Red Birds in . In , Shires played for the Fort Worth Cats in the Texas League and, in he served as a player-manager for the Harrisburg Senators in the New York‚ÄìPennsylvania League. Post-baseball career Shires announced plans to fight Max Baer for the World Heavyweight Boxing title and returned to the boxing ring in January 1935 but, was out of shape and was knocked out in the second round of a scheduled six round fight against Sid Hunter. Shires was charged with murder following the beating death of a man in December 1948. The two men had fought after drinking together. The charge was later reduced to aggravated assault. A jury later found him guilty of aggravated assault and fined him $25. Shires died on July 13, at the age of 60.

The Old Mill District is located southwest of downtown, roughly between Colorado Avenue on the west, Bond Street on the east and north and Reed Market to the south.  History  Old Mill District Bend The Old Mill District formerly housed two competing lumber mills. In 1916 the Shevlin-Hixon Lumber Company built a mill on the west bank of the Deschutes River and Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company built the \\"Mill A\\" complex on the east bank.Shevlin-Hixon Mill, Bend, Oregon, The Oregon History Project For the next 78 years, the mills dominated Bend's economy, pumping money and business into the town. At their peak, the companies were two of the largest pine sawmills in the world, running around the clock, employing more than 2,000 workers each and turning out more than 500 million board feet of lumber a year.\\"Bend's Mill District\\" KOHD News, October 19, 2009 The influx of mill workers ballooned the town's population. It jumped from 536 in 1910 to 5,414 in 1920, and by 1930, the city's population was 8,821.Shevlin-Hixon Mill, Bend, Oregon, The Oregon History Project After more than 20 years of non-stop logging, the forests in Central Oregon were becoming depleted. In 1937, the Bend Chamber of Commerce warned of economic disaster unless the mills started sustainable forestry. The mills ignored these warnings and continued producing at full capacity. By 1950, the forests' depletion led to the decline of Oregon's logging industry. Brooks-Scanlon bought the Shevlin- Hixon mill in 1950 and closed it just four months later. The Brooks-Scanlon Mill A closed in 1983. After the mills shut down, the site fell into ruin until William Smith Properties purchased the land in 1993 now known as the Old Mill District. Mill B continued to produce small amounts of lumber until 1993 when it also closed.  Events  The Old Mill District hosts events throughout the year, including Oregon WinterFest\\"Rail jam, motocross highlight WinterFest,\\" Bend Bulletin, February 12, 2010 Art in the High Desert,\\",\\" and many sporting and charitable events throughout the year.

Human Hands  Noland was a founding member of Human Hands and was their keyboard player who wrote and produced some of the band's material. Rodney Bingenheimer helped to break them by playing their music on KROQ-FM. Human Hands split up at the end of 1981 and Noland went on to become a member of Wall of Voodoo.  Wall of Voodoo  Bill Noland joined the band shortly after the release of Call of the West on I.R.S. Records. Noland played keyboards, trumpet and sang back-up vocals with Wall of Voodoo while touring extensively in the USA, Canada, Puerto Rico, and England. The culmination of the tour was Wall of Voodoo's 1983 US Festival performance for an estimated crowd of 150,000 fans. Shortly afterward, Bill Noland, Stan Ridgway and Joe Nanini left the band.  Solo career  After Wall of Voodoo broke up, Noland became a sound engineer, mixer and producer. He produced tracks for Thin White Rope on Frontier Records, Field Trip for Slash Records, and produced and collaborated with Ridgway on his solo albums, The Big Heat (IRS, 1986), Mosquitos (Geffen, 1989), Partyball (Geffen, 1991), Songs That Made This Country Great (IRS, 1992), Black Diamond (Birdcage, 1995), Work the Dumb Oracle (IRS, 1995) and The Way I Feel Today (Dis-Information, 1998).

William L. \\"Butch\\" Baxter purchased the boat in 1975 and apparently sometime after 1977 renamed her Mar-Sue.NavSource Online: Section Patrol Craft Photo Archive See W. See (SP 740) claims that Baxter purchased the boat in 1975 and named her Mar-Sue, but also shows photographs of the boat bearing her previous name, Misty Isle, in 1977. This apparent discrepancy is unexplained. As of 2010, Mar-Sue remains active in private use. Notes References * *SP-740 See W.

Personal and early life Balchen was born in Bergen, the son of chaplain Johan Peter Balchen (1783‚Äì1827) and his wife Christiane Wilhelmine Gulbrandsen (1789‚Äì1819). His early childhood was marred by his mother's death when he was four years old, and his father's when he was twelve. He married Benjamine Walgerda Heiberg (1845‚Äì1926) on 16 September 1869, the daughter of Caspar Cappelen Heiberg (1814‚Äì1855) and Emilie Christine Hansine Bjertn√¶s (1824‚Äì1865). Career and education Upon finishing his examen artium at the University of Oslo, he started studying theology. Owing to his economic difficulties, Balchen started teaching at Ole Jacob Broch and Hartvig Nissen's Latin school. Balchen eventually applied for a concession to establish a deaf school in Christiania. The King had erstwhile announced a state stipend to a person taking an education suited for creating a deaf school in South Norway.The only hitherto created deaf school in Norway was located in Trondheim. The executive board at the deaf school in Trondheim was sceptical towards Balchen, apparently because of his lack of religious education. He nevertheless gained a half-year stay at the school, impressing the authorities with his command of French orthography. The Norwegian government subsequently sponsored Balchen a study trip to Germany. Balchen visited some of the most important German deaf schools, and met among others the teacher and inspector Friedrich Moritz Hill at the deaf school in Wei√üenfels. Balchen returned to Norway in 1847, and started teaching two deaf girls the following year. In 1849, he received state support for this practice. There were in the beginning only three to five students at his school‚Äîwhich was named Christiania D√∏vstumme-Institut, but as time passed, more students came, and Balchen bought boarding rooms in the area for students hailing from the suburbs. Later on, Balchens started a class for students he considered qualified for studying. Two of the students‚ÄîLars Havstad and Halvard Aschehoug‚Äîtook examen artium with good grades in 1871. Balchen's school became very popular and well-reputated, and even students from far- abroad, travelled to Norway to become taught at his school. In 1857, the school was moved from Karl Johans Street‚Äîapproximately where Grand Hotel is today‚Äîto Schaftel√∏kken at Elisenberg, Frogner. The school stayed there until 1891, when it was relocated to Vibes gate at Hegdehaugen. Five years later, the school was nationalised. Later life and death In 1873, Balchen was rewarded the Order of St. Olav for his efforts for the deaf. He was also appointed member of a committee that should prepare a law granting the deaf, blind and mentally handicapped the right to compulsory education. A such law came into force for the deaf on 1 July 1883, for the blind in 1885 and for the mentally handicapped in 1891. After having stepped down from his positions at the deaf school, Balchen died, at age 84.

The screenplay was written by Mari Okada, with original character design by Mel Kishida. P.A.Works produced the project as the studio's tenth anniversary work. The anime aired between April and September 2011 and had two manga adaptations created. An animated film was released in Japanese theaters on March 30, 2013. Plot Hanasaku Iroha centers around Ohana Matsumae, a 16-year-old living in Tokyo, who is left in the care of her estranged maternal grandmother, following her mother's elopement with her boyfriend. Ohana arrives at her grandmother's country estate to realize she is the owner of a Taish≈ç period hot spring inn called Kissuis≈ç. She begins working at Kissuis≈ç at her grandmother's request, but finds herself at odds with many employees and customers at the inn. Initially feeling discouraged, she decides to use her circumstances as an opportunity to change herself for the better and to make amends with her deteriorating relationship with the Kissuis≈ç's staff for a more prominent future. =Characters= ; : :Ohana is an energetic and optimistic 16-year-old girl and the protagonist of Hanasaku Iroha. She is sent to live at her estranged grandmother's hot spring inn, Kissuis≈ç, after her mother elopes with her boyfriend to evade his debt. Her best friend, K≈çichi Tanemura, confessed his feelings to her before her departure, which was left unanswered until later in the series. At her grandmother's demand, she works at the inn as compensation for staying there. After parting with Koichi, she realized that she has feelings for him, though she still hasn't admitted it yet. However, she is always dependent on him. She is a strong willed girl who is stubborn and is realistic for her age. She likes to drink a mix of cola and black tea. ; : :Minko is a 16-year-old apprentice chef and resident at Kissuis≈ç. She is a tsundere, and dislikes Ohana from their first meeting, nicknaming her balut (she pronounces it hobiron (\\"h·ªôt v·ªãt l·ªôn\\" in Vietnamese for balut)), but has slowly accepted her as a friend. Against her parents' wishes, her dream is to become a professional chef, resulting in her search for training opportunities. Her search led her to Kissuis≈ç, where T≈çru Miyagishi accepted her as an apprentice chef. Since then, she has strong feelings for him and becomes jealous when he talks about other girls. ; : :Nako is a shy and timid 16-year-old cleaning part-time maid and waitress at Kissuis≈ç. She has three younger siblings whom she assists her parents in raising. She becomes close friends with Ohana and teaches her how to perform her duties. Nako is very good at swimming, by which she gains since childhood the nickname \\"Kappapa\\", after an aquatic mythic creature kappa. ; : :Yuina is the 16-year-old daughter and heiress to the Fukuya Inn, the rival inn of Kissuis≈ç. She is in the same high school as Ohana, Minko, and Nako, and is seen hanging out with them on several occasions. She is divided on the choice of whether to go on with her family's inn-running business, or to find herself a different form of career fulfillment. ; : :K≈çichi is a 16-year-old teenager and Ohana's best friend. K≈çichi confessed his feelings to Ohana before her departure, but was too afraid to hear her answer and ran away. He often offers support to Ohana when she feels down. He feels abandoned by Ohana as she adjusts to her new lifestyle. However, as the story progresses, he realizes Ohana still harbors feeling for him and eventually tries to repair their relationship. ; : :Ohana's 68-year-old grandmother and owner of Kissuis≈ç. Behind her fierce and strict composure towards her employees (to the point of physically reprimand them), Sui eventually reveals herself as comprehensive and caring toward them when most needed thus earning not only obedience from them, but also respect and devotion. ; : :Tomoe is the 28-year-old head waitress working at Kissuis≈ç. She enjoys hearing gossip about other employees and customers lodging at the inn. As a single woman near her thirties, Tomoe is usually reminded by her mother that she should start looking for a husband and start a family. ; : :Ohana's 32-year-old uncle. He was bullied by Satsuki during their childhood. He often calls upon Takako and considers her his partner. The two marry late in the series. After Kissuis≈ç's closure, Enishi plans to improve his management skills in order to succeed his mother. ; : :A 23-year-old junior chef working at Kissuis≈ç. He is very outspoken and easily frustrated. He strictly mentors and supervises Minko's training, often going too far with verbal abuse. Ohana was initially intimidated by him, but has since developed a dislike to T≈çru. However, T≈çru appears to develop feelings toward Ohana as he feels that she is the only one who is willing to say she needs him. Afterwards, he is often seen looking out for Ohana, much to Minko's jealousy. ; : :A 42-year-old cook working at Kissuis≈ç. Renji is T≈çru's mentor and the head chef of the Kissuis≈ç kitchen. He has a very gruff appearance, evidenced by a small facial scar, but has been shown to have a light-hearted side on occasion. He gets nervous very easily when under pressure, but is usually well-focused on his job. ; : :A 30-year-old business consultant adviser for Kissuis≈ç. She attended the same university as Enishi. She often has erratic plans to improve the inn and tends to spout out random English sayings. She eventually marries Enishi late in the series and takes on his family name as Takako Shijima. ; : :A 31-year-old novelist who frequently lodges at Kissuis≈ç. He writes erotic novels using the Kissuis≈ç's staff as character references. He eventually starts working at the inn after it is discovered that he can't pay his bill. Ironically, his past works include a cooking manga that inspired both Minko and T≈çru to become cooks themselves. ; : :A 73-year-old janitor working at Kissuis≈ç. He has been working at Kissuis≈ç since its establishment. The staff call him \\"Beanman\\". ; : :Ohana's 38-year- old mother. She is a journalist who elopes with her boyfriend to evade his debt. She leaves Ohana to the care of her mother, who claims to have disowned her daughter. She neglected Ohana as a child and raised her with the mentality of relying on oneself. She works as a hotel and inn critic, often asked to write scathing reviews by her higher ups. ; : :He was Ohana's father, who died when Ohana was a baby. He was a photographer and inspired Satsuki to be an editor.

Mania praised Kanae It≈ç's voice as Ohana, the animation quality, and execution of the plot. The reviewer however commented that the beginning was not new nor innovative. Anime News Network praised the realism and quality in the animation, score, and opening and ending theme music. The character designs were noted to be attractive yet subtle enough to retain the realism, and also noted how Ohana's design is much better than a moe clone. As the characters' personality developed, the reviewer highly praised the realistic interactions between them as they are touching and substantial. Ohana's relationship with her mother and grandmother was noted to be especially well written with daunting emotions. After reviewing the second half of the series, the reviewer considered Hanasaku Iroha to be one of the best titles in 2011. Hanasaku Iroha received a Jury Selection award in the Animation division of the 15th Japan Media Arts Festival.  Yuwaku Bonbori Festival  Hanasaku Iroha also had the effect of attracting fans of the show to visit the Yuwaku Onsen in Kanazawa, Ishikawa, the inspiration for the show's setting. Increased general interest culminates in the Yuwaku Bonbori Festival, held yearly around October. In the anime, the preparation and celebration of the fictional Bonbori Festival was a major plot point. In 2011, shortly after the show finished airing, the town of Yuwaku decided to bring this Festival into reality where there had previously been no equivalent celebration. In addition to typical Japanese festival attractions, the organizers also included a procession of participants carrying paper bonbori lanterns and a burning of ema plaques with particpants' wishes written on them, both of which are distinguishing characteristics of the festival as shown in the anime. During the festival, the town's inns are sold out and attendees number over 15,000 for more recent iterations. Originally, the festival was organized by individuals associated with P.A. Works. More recently, the town has attempted to broaden the appeal of the festival to beyond anime fans, including by inviting traditional musicians.

It is active since 1949. It is based at Xiamen, Fujian and is composed of the 86th Motorized Infantry Division (People's Republic of China) and the 91st Motorized Infantry Division, along with an armored brigade, an air defense brigade, a surface-to-air missile regiment, an artillery regiment, and an engineer regiment. It is considered a Category A unit, with priority status in terms of readiness, strength, and modern equipment. Based on its training activities and positioning, its primary mission is presumed to be the conquest of Taiwan. History The 31st Group Army traces its lineage to the Shantung Column of the Shantung Military Region which was formed around 1941. By 1945 the column had been reorganized and redesignated into several military districts, including the Chiao-Tung Military District. By 1946, elements of the Chiao-Tung MD were reorganized and redesignated 9th and 13th Columns. The 13th Column, commanded by Chou Chih-chien was composed of three divisions, including the 37th, 38th, and 39th. In the mid-to-late 1940s the 13th Column was reorganized and redesignated as the 31st Corps, also commanded by Chou Chih-chien. The 31st Corps was composed of the 91st, 92nd and 93rd Divisions. In late 1949 the 31st Corps, under the 10th bingtuan (Army or \\"Army Group\\"), took part in the Chekiang and Fukien Campaign conducting operations against or near Nanp'ing, Kut'ien and the Changchou-Amoy area.William W. Whitson (w/ Chen-hsia Huang). The Chinese High Command: A History of Communist Military Politics, 1927-71 (New York: Praeger; 1973) During the Korean War the 31st Corps was one of the few units to remain in China opposite Taiwan to defend against a potential US-Taiwan Invasion. The 31st was stationed in Fujian. In 1958, elements of the 31st Group Army took part in the artillery bombardment of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands that precipitated the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Current The 31st Army Group is currently one of the three army groups assigned to the Nanjing Military Region. From mid-July 1991 to May 1992 elements of the 31st Group Army conducted a variety of exercises and operations in the Nanjing Military Region according to the Chinese Council of Advanced Politics. In mid-July 1991 in the Longhai area of Fujian Province, a regiment from the 91st Division conducted routine training and armed swimming training in an effort to improve the unit's amphibious warfare capability. Also in July 1991, the reconnaissance battalion of the 86th Infantry Division along with soldiers from the Zhugong area conducted similar training in the Xiaocheng and Dacheng areas Lianjiang Xian, Fujian Province. In early October 1991 the 258th Regiment of the 86th Motorized Infantry Division, along with units from various military sub-districts, conducted defensive exercises and combined militia exercises in the Banding Area, Lianjiang Xian, Fujian Province. In mid October to early November 1991 the 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions (since disbanded) of the 31st Group Army conducted routine training and field training activities in the Fuzhou area of Changpu and Nanan.

Women in One Woman: the Biography of Laure Moghaizel. Dar An-Nahar. Beirut: 2010. She was awarded with the world-renowned National Order of the Cedar (Commander), a medal in recognition of her many years of social and public service. Moghaizel was a founding member of many organizations including the Democratic Party of Lebanon, the Lebanese Association for Human Rights, and Bahithat (Lebanese Women Researchers).  Early life and education  Laure Moghaizel was born on April 21, 1929, in Hasbayeh, Lebanon, to Labiba Saab and Nasib Salim Nasr. She, her sister, and her two brothers lived in three cities during their younger years - Jounieh, Aley and Baalbeck. Moghaizel's father was an acclaimed lawyer whose work demanded constant relocation throughout Lebanon, allowing her increased exposure to various settings, peoples and cultures. She became fluent in English, French, and Arabic. Moghaizel's parents, specifically her mother Labiba Saab, were seen as progressive, in the context of the time period. They encouraged each of their children to reach their highest educational potential. Her mother urged her and her sister to continue their studies post- Baccalaureate, though post-graduate studies were generally limited to the wealthy in Lebanon. Moghaizel acquired her secondary education at Aley National School where she received a secular, progressive, Arab education. After, she moved to Beirut and continued her studies at the Besan√ßon, which was considered one of the renowned schools in the region at that time. She continued her education at Saint Joseph University at the Institute of Oriental Studies, where she pursued a degree in Philosophy in Arabic, and later a Law degree. In law school, Laure was one of only three women in her class of 100 men. Laure also met her future husband, Joseph Moghaizel, while they were both students at university. It was during her first year of law school in 1949 that Moghaizel began to meet other like-minded women, many of whom similarly pioneered women's rights in Lebanon. These figures included Laure Tabet, Mirvat Ibrahim and Najla Saab. Moghaizel became socially and politically established during her early adulthood. She decided on a career in the public sector, became involved with the feminist movement, and committed her life to the intersection of law and women's issues.  Political career and activism  = Early career = After Lebanese independence from the French Mandate in 1943, initial advances in Lebanese women's rights were made by two major advocacy groups, the Lebanese Women Union and the Christian Women's Solidarity Association. These two bodies merged in 1952 under the Lebanese Council of Women. Moghaizel herself was a member of the Christian Women's Solidarity Association, and remained a part of the later Council. During the Lebanese Civil War, however, the Council's activist agenda stagnated as it set aside its ambitions for women's civil rights in order to immediately provide welfare services to war victims . Moghaizel maintained her commitment to the public life and wartime preservation of human rights through several communal efforts. The beginning act of this being the Peace March on the 6th of March with Beirut University College (now L.A.U) where she alongside twenty two people from various countries formed a movement to support the Labour Union demonstrations, in addition to organizing a sit down in front of parliament . The movement initiated another campaign called ‚ÄúThe Document of Civil Peace‚Äù which collected 70,000 signatures from Lebanese citizens who were against the war. Whilst this might not have helped stop the war, she recalls ‚Äúit helped us overcome the war,‚Äù in her interview in 1995 interview with Hania Osserian (Osseiran, 2016). Women were not largely involved in the hostilities during the war, not because they were less violent but due to their absence in both government and the militias. As a result, women like Laure Moghaizel rose sought alternative methods of contributing to the rebuilding of Lebanon. Therefore, it is in this period of civil war that Moghaizel rose to prominence mostly for her legal activities and her vicious women rights advocacy. = Legal activism and approach = Moghaizel was considered distinct from other contemporary activists due to the way she undertook the advancement of women's rights as part of a broader campaign to strengthen the institution of human rights in Lebanon. As described by author Rita Stephan, ‚ÄúLaure Moghaizel considered women‚Äôs rights as a matter of equal and fair treatment for all citizens‚Äù . She specifically took five approaches in fitting women's issues into a framework of general legal rights. These included: political rights, legal competence, economic and social rights, rights under punitive law, and rights under personal status law. Capitalizing on her law degree in taking this approach, her work granted women new legal rights outside of the traditional issue areas of public visibility and civic rights that were prioritized by earlier women's groups. In 1985, Moghaizel was central in the establishment the Lebanese Association for Human Rights. This was accomplished in collaboration with her husband, Joseph Moghaizel, also a lawyer. As legal representatives of the Association, the Moghaizel couple advanced a human rights agenda which paid special attention to the needs of Lebanese women in both public and private contexts. The couple worked through the courts to reform ‚Äúimportant but often-overlooked laws that impacted women‚Äôs lives‚Äù. These laws ranged from rights in business transactions to social service privileges. (See below for full list of accomplishments) Moghaizel's later work extended beyond national laws impacting women to strengthen the enforcement of international treaties in Lebanon. In 1990, she worked closely with the Lebanese Association for Human Rights in pressuring the government to adopt a constitutional clause that re-committed the nation to upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which Lebanon technically adopted in 1948. The clause set a key precedent in Lebanon that international humanitarian standards must supersede national law. This precedent paved the way later when the Lebanese government adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1996. Effectively an international doctrine of women's rights, CEDAW had been signed on to by 114 countries, including five Arab states, by the time it gained momentum in Lebanon. Lobbying for the adoption of CEDAW in Lebanon is considered another one of the Moghaizel couple's biggest contributions to human and women's rights. = Accomplishments = The following list contains a chronology of advancements in Lebanese women's rights associated with the work of Laure Moghaizel: * 1983 Right to legally sell and purchase contraceptives * 1987 Entitlement to retirement benefits, and the establishment of an equal institutional retirement age at 64 for men and women (previously women were required to retire five years before their male counterparts, at ages 55 and 60 respectfully) Stephan, 116, 123 * 1990 Constitutional clause strengthening Lebanese commitment to upholding the UDHR * 1993 Right of women to legally witness in real-estate contracts * 1994 Right for married women to practice commerce and/or open a business without the consent of their husbands (Stephan 116, 123) * 1995 Right of women in the diplomatic field to maintain Lebanese citizenship and civic jobs in the event of marrying a foreign husband (Stephan 116) * 1995 Right of women (including married women) to obtain life insurance (Stephan, 124) * 1996 Lebanese adoption of CEDAW = Personal life = Laure Moghaizel met her husband Joseph when they were both students at Saint Joseph University in Beirut, Lebanon. They met during a national students‚Äô demonstration, foreshadowing of the beginning of their life and career together. Laure and Joseph, both Christian Catholics, married in 1953. They had 5 children: Nada, Fadi, Jana, Amal and Naji, who describe her as being ‚Äúa very devoted mother‚Äù. In an interview, Laure explained how much she enjoyed coming home from the office, ‚Äú...[taking] off [her] suit and slipping into some overalls, [playing] with the children, [giving] them their baths, and [helping] them with their homework‚Äù (LaTeef 206). Her daughter, Nada Moghaizel Nasr describes her mother as being someone who did it all: she was simultaneously a homemaker that cooked, cleaned and raised children, and an exceedingly successful advocate against social and political inequality. Moghaizel created a home environment for her family where open dialogue was encouraged and opinions were respected. One of her daughters, Nada, explained the importance for Laure that her children were introduced to literature and the arts, so she often read them poetry before bed. Her youngest son, Naji Moghaizel, was born with Down syndrome, and is one of the reasons why Laure and Joseph became involved in movements to support the disabled. One of her daughters, Jana Moghaizel, was educated as a linguist at the Sorbonne and was a published author. She came to visit her parents in Beirut for Christmas in 1986 during the Lebanese Civil War. She was one of the many innocent victims killed during this conflict. Jana, aged 28, was killed on the stairs of her parents‚Äô apartment building, located on the demarcation line between East and West Beirut. Following their daughter's death, the Moghaizels concentrated themselves more deeply on their work. Laure once said that she ‚Äú[could] not forgive anyone who participated in the war‚Äù and that the ‚ÄúLebanese people killed our own children‚Äù. Moghaizel wore black for the duration of her life to mourn Jana's death. Joseph Moghaizel passed in 1995 after 42 years of marriage, widowing Laure. Following a two-year period of illness, Laure passed in her home on May 25th, 1997. She was 68 years old.  Legacy  Laure Moghaizel's work on setting up the Lebanese Association for Human Rights in 1985 is regarded as the largest achievement of her career. The Association managed to improve access to basic human rights for the average Lebanese person. By setting influential precedents through the court system, the association expanded the rights of women in Lebanon, especially in relation to business. The adoption of CEDAW by Lebanon was another great accomplishment associated with the Moghaizels. However, Laure Moghaizel's accomplishments are viewed critically by certain academics in the context of her personal life, particularly her marriage and her family. North Carolina State University professor Rita Stephan asked in a 2010 article, ‚ÄúHow does the nuclear family and, in the Moghaizel case, the married couple, impinge upon and shape activism for women‚Äôs rights?‚Äù. Stephan examines the extent to which Moghaizel's marriage and social norms influenced her activism, accepting Nancy Fraser's contention that contemporaries lack ‚Äúa coherent, integrated, balanced conception of agency . . . that can accommodate both the power of social constraints and the capacity to act situatedly against them‚Äù (Ibid.) Stephan argues that Laure Moghaizel gained ‚Äúsocial capital from being able to show the full approval of their families and husbands‚Äù (Ibid.) in the Lebanese context . Joseph's presence in Laure's life can be simultaneously viewed as a boon and restricting factor that set precedent for future social activism in Lebanon. Her contributions to feminism, therefore, are considered by critics to provide a framework for advancing women's‚Äô rights in developing societies that also limits the extent of potential social change. Laure's family has remained prominent in the Lebanese legal community, with her aforementioned daughter Dr. Nada Moghaizel Naga serving as a dean at St. Joseph University and their son Fadi Moghaizel operating his parents‚Äô former law office.

The Nationwide SAR Initiative (NSI) builds on what law enforcement and other agencies have been doing for years ‚Äî gathering information regarding behaviors and incidents associated with criminal activity ‚Äî but without the customary restrictions on collecting data on individuals in the absence of reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The program has established a standardized process whereby SARs can be shared among agencies to help detect and prevent terrorism-related criminal activity. This process is in direct response to the mandate to establish a \\"unified process for reporting, tracking, and accessing [SARs]\\" in a manner that rigorously protects the privacy and civil liberties of Americans, as called for in the 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing (NSIS), which in turn was authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement or by private citizens are forwarded to state and major urban area fusion centers as well as DHS and the FBI for analysis. Sometimes this information is combined with other information to evaluate the suspicious activity in greater context. The program is primarily under the direction of the US Department of Justice. Background Suspicious activity is defined in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard (ISE-SAR FS) Version 1.5 as \\"observed behavior reasonably indicative of pre-operational planning related to terrorism or other criminal activity.\\" It is important to note that the NSI is a behavior-focused approach to identifying suspicious activity. Factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation are NOT considered as factors that create suspicion (except if used as part of a specific suspect description). The behaviors outlined in the ISE-SAR FS were identified by subject-matter experts; validated through implementation in the Los Angeles, California, Police Department and the application of ten years of State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) Program experience; and then adjusted based on input by privacy advocacy representatives. At the completion of this process, in May 2009, the ISE-SAR FS was published, with the entire SAR process anchored on behaviors of suspicious activity, not ethnicity, race, or gender. The NSI is currently being implemented through a partnership between the national network of fusion centers and key federal agencies that will coordinate with law enforcement officers in their states. This partnership spans the spectrum of customized technology solutions and includes training and the development of comprehensive privacy, civil rights and civil liberties policies at both the federal and fusion center levels. This approach also provides for a decentralized process that respects the state's unique requirements but maintains national standards that permit the interoperability of information exchanges and the consistent application of a privacy framework, and is consistent with the allocation of responsibilities to the 72 designated State and major urban area fusion centers. On December 17, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice was named the Executive Agent to establish and operate the Program Management Office (PMO) for the NSI, taking on responsibility for coordinating existing resources and managing additional support to further develop and deploy the NSI. In March 2010, the PMO was established within the Bureau of Justice Assistance. This interagency office, led by senior staff from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), also coordinates closely with other federal, state, local, and tribal partners. The goal of the PMO is to facilitate the implementation of the NSI across all levels of government, and assist participating agencies to adopt compatible processes, policies, and standards that foster broader sharing of SARs, while ensuring that privacy and civil liberties are protected in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Primary functions of the Program Management Office include advocating on behalf of the NSI, providing guidance to participants at all levels, and coordinating various efforts within the NSI. Given the criticality of privacy and civil liberties issues, the PMO works collaboratively with, and is supported by, the DOJ Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. NSI Training To ensure that the behavior-focused approach that is outlined in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard is institutionalized, the NSI created a multifaceted training approach designed to increase the effectiveness of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement professionals in identifying, reporting, evaluating, and sharing pre-incident terrorism indicators to prevent acts of terrorism. There are currently three briefings/trainings available through the NSI PMO, with several others under development: * Executive Briefing Law enforcement executives play a vital role in ensuring that the SAR process is not only successfully implemented but effectively supported. The SAR Executive Briefings focus on executive leadership, policy development, privacy and civil liberties protections, agency training, and community outreach. Fusion centers, law enforcement professional associations, and additional entities conduct these types of briefings in a variety of venues. * Analytic Training Ensuring that SARs are properly reviewed and vetted is critical to promoting the integrity of information submitted; protecting citizens' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; and successfully implementing the SAR process. The SAR Analytic Role Training focuses on the evaluation of SARs to identify behaviors that may be associated with pre-incident terrorism planning and the process for sharing terrorism-related SARs nationwide. Through this curriculum, analysts and investigators are trained to recognize terrorism- related pre-incident indicators and to validate‚Äîbased on a combination of knowledge, experience, and available information‚Äîwhether the behavior has a potential nexus to terrorism and meets criteria for submission. The training is delivered in an eight-hour workshop format. * Line-Officer Training Frontline law enforcement personnel are trained to recognize behavior and incidents that may indicate criminal activity associated with terrorism. Their routine duties position them to observe and report suspicious behaviors or activities. The SAR Line Officer Training focuses on the critical role line officers have in the effective implementation of the SAR process by identifying and documenting suspicious activity. To efficiently deliver training to a large number of line officers in a timely manner, this training is delivered through a 15-minute CD that has been posted to several online/distance-learning formats. Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Protections NSI program administrators claim they are aware of the importance of protecting the personal privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of all Americans, and in response have developed and implemented a comprehensive NSI Privacy Protection Framework that is required for agencies at all levels of government prior to participation in the NSI. Participating agencies must have an approved privacy policy that specifically addresses the SAR process; applies the protections outlined in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard (Version 1.5) and the ISE Privacy Guidelines; and participate in each of the three training programs described above. The NSI PMO also requires that participating fusion centers have policies that address how the center incorporates applicable state laws, agency rules, and regulations into the sharing of terrorism-related SAR information. =NSI Privacy Protection Framework= The NSI requires each site to consider privacy throughout the SAR process by fully adopting the following NSI Privacy Protection Framework prior to NSI participation: * Privacy policy: The adoption and implementation of an approved privacy policy that contains ISE-SAR privacy protections that are in compliance with required provisions contained in the ISE-SAR Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Protection Policy Template or the Fusion Center Privacy Policy Development: Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Policy Template. It is important to note that an NSI program requirement exists that requires sites to have a policy developed and adopted prior to the interstate sharing of ISE-SARs. * ISE-SAR Functional Standard: The application of the most current version of the ISE-SAR FS, which reinforces constitutional standards, including the protection of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and limitations on the use of certain factors‚Äîincluding race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation‚Äîin the gathering, collecting, storing, and sharing of information about individuals. The standard also includes reliability indicators, included as a result of input from privacy advocates. The functional standard, through the use of Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD), allows the originating agency to include or not include fields that contain personal information based upon the agency's rules and policies. * Privacy training: The delivery of privacy training, through which the ISE-SAR FS is effectively communicated to personnel with responsibilities in the ISE-SAR arena, ensures the proper application of this standard. Furthermore, to expedite privacy policy development and implementation, it is strongly recommended that NSI sites have access to the services of a trained privacy officer who is available to provide ongoing advice and assistance regarding the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. Three levels of training have been developed for the NSI, all of which include privacy materials. The NSI training levels are chief executive, analyst investigator, and line officer. =SAR Vetting Process= A key aspect of the NSI is the SAR vetting process. Before an agency can move SARs from the agency systems to the ISE, two forms of vetting must occur. Supervisors who initially receive a SAR from law enforcement officers, public safety agencies, private sector partners, or citizens must initially review the SAR to determine whether it has a nexus to terrorism and whether it includes the behaviors identified in the ISE-SAR FS. Trained analysts must then analyze the SAR against the behaviors identified in the ISE-SAR FS. Throughout the vetting process, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are vigilantly and actively protected through the training that analysts receive and through the system attributes that are a part of the NSI. =Community Outreach= The success of the NSI largely depends on the ability of law enforcement agencies to earn and maintain the public's trust, which is accomplished through a transparent process that addresses the concerns of citizens and by engaging collaboratively with advocacy groups. To support a fusion center's efforts to interact with its community, as well as local law enforcement, the NSI Program Management Office (PMO) led the development and participation in the Building Communities of Trust (BCOT) initiative. This initiative is designed to assist fusion centers in engaging community leaders in a dialogue about the center's functions, including the SAR process, the NSI, and the need for interaction with community leaders. Outreach to advocacy groups has served an essential role in shaping the NSI Privacy Protection Framework and will continue to play an important role in the NSI as it moves forward. =System Attributes= In addition to multiple levels of SAR review by trained personnel, there are system attributes that support privacy protections for the gathering, collection, storage, and sharing of SAR information, such as: * Improved data standards for information sharing using the National Information Exchange Model (www.niem.gov). * Leveraging existing secure systems, networks, and resources, such as the Regional Information Sharing Systems, Law Enforcement Online, the Homeland Security Information Network, the National Criminal Intelligence Resource Center (www.ncirc.gov), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's eGuardian system. * Built-in design privacy protections, such as user authentication, \\"investigative purposes only\\" disclosures upon log-in, articulated investigative reason for accessing the system, clearly stated \\"for official law enforcement use only\\" warning before system access, and audit logs for capturing search transactions. * Formatting in accordance with the ISE-SAR FS's IEPD format, which includes the application of privacy fields. =Compliance Verification= The U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council developed the Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Compliance Verification for the Intelligence Enterprise, which is a compliance verification document, for the purpose of assisting intelligence enterprises in complying with all applicable privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protection laws, regulations, and policies while sharing appropriate intelligence and information needed to safeguard America. Criticism According to an investigation by the Washington Post, this program, \\"by far the largest and most technologically sophisticated in the nation's history, collects, stores and analyzes information about thousands of U.S. citizens and residents, many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing.\\" Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement, or even by private citizens, are forwarded to the program, and profiles are constructed of persons who are merely under suspicion, without adjudicated evidence or reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed. It has been described as \\"a vast domestic spying network to collect information on Americans\\". According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the program's fusion centers \\"raise very serious privacy issues at a time when new technology, government powers and zeal in the \\"war on terrorism\\" are combining to threaten Americans' privacy at an unprecedented level.\\" In 2005 and 2006, fifty-three individuals involved with peace groups, the anti-death penalty movement, and other causes were improperly added to a terrorist and drug trafficking data base by the Maryland State Police. Former Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs said the 14 months of covert police surveillance, which took place in 2005 and 2006, was \\"not predicated on any information indicating that those individuals or groups had committed or planned any criminal misconduct.\\" See also * fusion center * operation TIPS * trapwire References External links https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/are-we-safer/ Criminal investigation Human rights in the United States Intelligence gathering law Law enforcement in the United States Counter- terrorism in the United States Terrorism databases Government databases in the United States ","title":"Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative"},{"id":"30135081","text":"Suratgarh tehsil (in Hindi and Rajasthani ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ó‡§¢‡§º ‡§§‡§π‡§∏‡•Ä‡§≤ ) is the largest administrative region (tehsil) in the Ganganagar district.

Benedict Spinola (1519/20 ‚Äì 1580), born in Genoa and died in London, also called Benedick Spinola, and in Italian Benedetto Spinola, was a 16th-century Genoese merchant of the Spinola family who lived his whole adult life in the City of London, then the principal seaport of the Kingdom of England. Beginning his career as a clerk, he rose to become an exporter of woollen cloths and importer of wines and also served the English government as an agent and financier. He never married and died of the plague in London in August 1580, shortly after his return from a mission to the Seventeen Provinces. Life Born at Genoa, Spinola was the second son of Battista Spinola by his marriage to a cousin, Elisabetta, a daughter of Giacomo Spinola. The family was an important one in the city, and in 1556 Spinola's father declined election as Doge.John Bennell, Spinola, Benedict (1519/20‚Äì1580) in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004), online ed., January 2008, accessed 21 December 2010 (subscription required) Little is known of Spinola's early life, but by 1541 he was in London working as a clerk at a salary of two pounds a year for Bastian Bony, postmaster to the City of London's foreign merchants. Spinola lived his whole adult life in the parish of St Gabriel Fenchurch, latterly joined there by his nephews Hannibal and Ascaneo Spinola. He never married and had a property in Shoreditch known as \\"Spinola's pleasure\\". Unusually for a foreigner, Spinola was fully naturalized in 1552, which gave him the right to pay taxes and customs dues at the rates applied to the English. In 1559 he was an exporter of woollen cloths and an importer of wines.

He traded with his three brothers who lived in Antwerp, Giacomo, Francisco, and Pasquale Spinola, and at home in London was an important merchant.

He became an adviser to the English government, gathering intelligence from correspondents overseas and negotiating financial questions, and by the 1570s was dealing in huge sums of money. In 1568, Huguenot raiders forced ships into English ports which were carrying silver lent by Genoese merchants to be used for paying the troops of the Duke of Alba. For security, the silver was brought ashore, and Spinola acted for the English government in repaying the Genoese. At a heralds' visitation of London in 1568, Spinola showed a certificate from the 'Seigniory of Genoa' to the effect that he was the lawful son of Baptiste Spinola \\"who bare these Arms abovesaide\\", and another from the Earl of Bedford, who certified that he had been in Genoa in 1566The year 1566 is suggested by the editor of Visitation of London, 1568, to be an error for 1556, when Bedford was in Italy. and that in that year \\"the said Babtiste\\", Spinola's father, \\"did refuse to be Duke of the same Citie\\".Robert Cooke, Hugh Stanford London, Visitation of London, 1568, with additional pedigrees 1569‚Äì90, the arms of the city companies and a London subsidy roll, 1589, Harleian Society vol. 110 (1963), p. 103 In 1568, in the letters patent of Elizabeth I which established a new joint stock company called the Society of Mines Royal, Spinola is named as one of the principals of the Society, together with the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Leicester, Lord Mountjoy, Lionel Duckett, and others.Memoirs of the Geological Survey of England and Wales, Volume 2, Issue 2, (1848), p. 639 In 1571, Spinola and Lionel Duckett between them made a loan to Queen Elizabeth I of ¬£4,100.William Robert Scott, The Constitutions and Finance of English, Scottish and Irish Joint-stock Companies to 1728, p. 58 In 1578 Spinola acted as agent for an English loan to the Union of Brussels.

Meskhetian Turks were also relocated to Azerbaijan from Central Asia before and after the end of the Soviet Union. With the booming petroleum industry, immigration from Turkey has also followed. In 2010, every eighth resident in Azerbaijan was a migrant, of whom more than 90% of them are Azerbaijanis and 70% are internally displaced persons from the territories occupied by Armenia.  History  In the post- Soviet period hundreds of people immigrated to Azerbaijan. But between 1989 and 1990 Azerbaijan faced with mass emigration. The main reasons of this emigration were difficulties in the transition and economic crisis as Azerbaijan was in the state of war. According to the official sources, emigration and immigration mainly occurred after the collapse of the USSR, between 1990 and 1992. Azerbaijan faced a mass influx of refugees originating from other former Soviet Republics, especially Armenia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Soon these flows declined, but immigrant flow from neighboring Middle Eastern states increased. From 1991 to 2011 about 410 thousand migrants arrived in Azerbaijan for permanent residence. In 2008 Azerbaijan was not emigration donor country anymore. Between 2008 and 2010 totally 4,700 people left, 8,100 people immigrated to Azerbaijan. Most of them were citizens of the CIS. Between 2008 and 2010 only 953 persons immigrated to Azerbaijan from other countries, including 10 people from the United States and 9 from Germany.https://esa.un.org/miggmgprofiles/indicators/files/Azerbaijan.pdf In 2006 Azerbaijani President approved a decree on State Migration Program of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2006-2008 which was aimed at the establishment of state-of-the-art migration management system in Azerbaijan. So far more than 20 legislative acts related to migration issues have been adopted in Azerbaijan. In order to protect the rights of migrants, Azerbaijan has acceded to the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and Palermo Protocols.http://www.refworld.org/publisher,NATLEGBOD,,AZE,,,0.html#SRTop41 Action Plan between Azerbaijan and the European Union was adopted within the European Neighborhood Policy in November 2006. The Action Plan included migration related issues such as migration management, asylum issues, prevention of illegal migration, dialogue on readmission matters, reintegration of returned migrants, visa facilitation.http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/enp/pdf/pdf/progress2010/sec10_519_en.pdf  Effect of immigration  = Demographic facts = The specialists define three groups of immigrants in Azerbaijan such as ethnic Azeries who resided in other republics of the USSR for a long time (mostly Russia and to a less extent Ukraine), but move to the country most often (Talysh, Lezghins, Avars, etc.), ethnic Azeries, mostly coming from Georgia, and labor immigrants from different countries (Turkey, India, Pakistan, etc.) In 1990s, refugees from other countries began to immigrate to Azerbaijan, especially from Russia (Chechens), as well as from Afghanistan and Iraq regarding to various conflicts in these regions. In parallel, religious missionaries and migrant workers from Eastern countries, among which Turks and Iranians were dominated, immigrated to Azerbaijan. According to the report of State Migration Service of Azerbaijan 208 foreigners (Afghanistan-94 people, Pakistan-77 people, Iran-29 people, Iraq-5 people) applied for asylum in Azerbaijan. Two of them received refugee status (totally 5 people together with family members.) As immigration rules was tightened in Russia in 2006, Chinese migrants, as well as citizens of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and other far eastern countries began to immigrate to other countries, as well as to Azerbaijan. According to the official data of the Ministry of Interior, there were up to 1,000 Chinese people in 2008.http://www.migrationpolicycentre.eu/docs/migration_profiles/Azerbaijan.pdf = Economic = Immigrants pay 1,000 manats ($587,96) in taxes each year to work in Azerbaijan for five years. 12,898 migrants from 95 countries were registered as of 2012. Labor migrants mostly came to Azerbaijan from Turkey and Georgia. Turkish migrants are mainly work in the construction sector. Georgian migrants choose the service sectors of the Azerbaijani economy.https://www.azernews.az/nation/42828.html  Religious and cultural adaptation  96 percent of Azerbaijani population is Muslims. But all religious confessions are equal before the law. Until Islam, the religions such as Zoroastrianism and Christianity already existed in Azerbaijan. Currently, Islam is the dominant religion in Azerbaijan. Director General of ISESCO Dr. Abdulaziz Othman expressing his attitude to religious tolerance in Azerbaijan stated: ‚ÄúISESCO has to reveal to the whole world how ancient and rich culture you have. We will accomplish all requirements from our side in terms of implementing documents signed in the field of cooperation with your country and this cooperation will be a sample for other member states.‚Äùhttps://migration.gov.az/post.php?pageid=6115&scatid;=041‚ü®=en During his visit to Azerbaijan in 2002 Rome Patriarch Bartholomew I stated: ‚ÄúI got satisfied from the level of religious tolerance.

As different cultural communities such as Russians, Ukrainians, Lacs, Lezgins, Slavians, Tats, Tatars, Georgians, Ingiloys, Talishians, Avars, Meskhetian turks, European and mountain Jews, Germans and Hellenes exist in all regions of Azerbaijan, rich cultural and spiritual heritage was formed in Azerbaijan throughout the centuries.http://theprisma.co.uk/2017/05/01/multiculturalism-is-now-an- essential-ideology/ Immigrants from different nationalities do not face any difficulties in adapting to the country.

Vegetation in the park, once dominated by Himalayan blackberries, includes native grasses, wildflowers, and dogwood. Cedar waxwings, killdeer, orioles, chickadees, and other birds frequent the park. A bench along the trail offers views of Ross Island and other spots along the river. It took about 10 years to organize and develop the park, formerly a \\"derelict patch of land\\" near the Macadam Bay Club, a residential houseboat community. The South Portland Neighborhood Association worked with Portland Parks & Recreation to complete the work. The park is \\"one of the region's smallest, but most biologically productive\\" greenspaces.

Russia is a case before the European Court of Human Rights concerning the prohibition of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 Moscow Pride gay rights marches in Russia's capital. The case was brought by Russian LGBT activist Nikolay Alexeyev, organiser of the marches, who claimed the banning of the marches had violated Article 11 (freedom of assembly) of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed furthermore that he had not received an effective remedy under Article 13 against the violation of Article 11, and that he had been discriminated against by the authorities in Moscow under Article 14 in their consideration of his applications to hold the marches. The First Section of the Court, sitting as a Chamber, found unanimously that there had been violations of Articles 11, 13 and 14 of the Convention. Their judgment was issued on 21 October 2010 and a referral by the Russian government to the Grand Chamber of the Court rejected on 11 April 2011,Press release No. 347, European Court of Human Rights, April 15, 2011 at which point the judgment became final. Background The Applicant, Nikolay Alexeyev (spelt by the Court, Alekseyev), born 23 December 1977 in Moscow, is a Russian LGBT rights activist, lawyer and journalist. =Events in 2006= In 2006, the Applicant along with several others began organising a march in Moscow, the capital of Russia, to demonstrate against discrimination against LGBT people in Russia. The march was to be held on 27 May that year, the anniversary of the legalisation of homosexuality in Russia. On 16 February, a statement was released by the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, stating that any proposed LGBT rights march would not be permitted to go ahead. Notice was given by the organisers of the march to the Mayor on 15 May 2006, that around two thousand people were expected to participate in a march from the Moscow Post Office along Myasnitskaya Street to Lubyanka Square, on 27 May starting at 3pm and lasting until 5pm. On 18 May, the organisers were informed that the Mayor had refused permission for the march on grounds of public order, for the prevention of riots and the protection of health, morals and the rights and freedoms of others. The organisers submitted an alternative application involving only a picket in Lubyanka Square and also appealed the original refusal to a judge, however both were unsuccessful. On 27 May 2006, when the march was intended to have been held, the Applicant along with several others attended a conference in honour of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, which had been on 17 May. The announced their intention of go to the Alexander Garden along the Western length of the Kremlin Wall, and lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as an act of remembrance to victims of fascism, including LGBT victims. They intended to follow this with a protest against the banning of the march with a fifteen-minute picket at the office of the Mayor of Moscow on Tverskaya Street. When the Applicant and fifteen others arrived at the Garden, they found the gates locked and some hundred and fifty policemen from the OMON riot police unit patrolling, as well as around one hundred individuals protesting against the planned flower- laying. The Applicant was arrested and the other demonstrators proceeded to the Mayor's office. Around one hundred arrests were made by the OMON police officers of people attacking the LGBT demonstrators. The Applicant's account of events on this day was corroborated by reports from the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) and Human Rights Watch. =Events in 2007= On 15 May 2007, the Applicant and other individuals submitted another application to the Mayor's office to hold a similar march to that proposed the year before, this time with an estimated attendance of five thousand one hundred people. This application was refused, and an alternative submitted proposing a picket before the Mayor's residence in Tverskaya Street and another in Novopushkinskiy Park, both of which were denied. On 27 May, the Applicant along with around twenty others attempted to deliver a petition against the prohibition of demonstration to the Mayor's office, but was detained by police along with two other men. He was convicted of the administrative offence of disobeying a lawful order from the police and fined one thousand roubles. =Events in 2008= On 18 April 2008, the Applicant along with other organisers submitted notice of ten intended marches to be held on 1 and 2 May 2008. All were refused on public safety grounds, and the organisers submitted another fifteen applications for marches on 3 and 5 May, all of which were refused for the same reasons. The Applicant then submitted a raft of other proposals, including one to the recently elected President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, stating his intention to hold a march in the Alexander Garden on 31 May 2008, to which he received no reply. The Applicant appealed all of the refusals unsuccessfully, and attempted to organise a picket for 17 May calling for criminal charges to be brought against the Mayor for banning the marches. Permission for this was refused on 13 May on the same grounds as previously, however the organisers managed to hold a picket for around ten minutes on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street near the Mayor's residence. Judgment Alexeyev applied to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming the events surrounding the attempted marches in 2006 - 2008 had violated his right to freedom of assembly under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He also claimed that he had not been able to access an effective remedy for the violation of Article 11, a violation of Article 13; and that the refusal to allow the marches to go forward had been discriminatory, in that it was made on the basis of his and other participants' sexual orientation, a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 11. The Court unanimously found violations of all three articles. =Article 11 (freedom of assembly)= Government's submissions The Government claimed that domestic law allowed for the restriction of assembly on safety grounds, and that the circumstances of the Applicant's proposed marches and strength of public opinion against them would have meant a high risk of violence. They claimed Article 11 must be interpreted as allowing governments a broad margin of appreciation, as this was required to accommodate the cultural situation of homosexuality in Russia. The Government also claimed that it had been necessary to ban the event for the protection of morals, referring prominent religious organisations' opposition to the march, and that, as there was no consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality within society, national authorities were better placed than the European Court to determine the conditions for such events. Applicant's submissions The Applicant responded that the provisions used to ban the marches applied only to the safety and suitability of proposed venues rather than to a general risk of violence, and that the authorities on refusing an application for these reasons were obliged to suggest an alternative venue, which had not been done. He further contended that the Government's definition of morals was incorrect, as it referred only to majoritarian public opinion without regard to the concepts of pluralism or diversity. Furthermore, the proposed marches would not have been a threat to morals as they were concerned with human rights and civil liberties and would not have involved any sexually provocative content. He claimed the Government's references to public safety were unsubstantiated as they had not demonstrated an assessed risk of violence. He claimed finally that the sweeping nature of the ban was disproportionate and could not be justified on the grounds that it may have shocked or confused some parts of society (BƒÖczkowski v Poland). Findings of the Court The Court found it unnecessary to consider the legitimate aim or domestic lawfulness of the ban as it had found the ban did not satisfy the requirement of being necessary in a democratic society. The Court reiterated that Article 11 includes within it protection for assemblies which may be at risk of attack from groups who disagree with or are offended by the assembly's aims or purpose. (para.73) The Government had referred inter alia to a statement opposing the ban by the head Muslim cleric in Nizhniy Novgorod (Russia's fourth-largest city), that, \\"as a matter of necessity, homosexuals must be stoned to death\\", as evidence of the likely public disorder which would result from the march. The Court found that, \\"[b]y relying on such blatantly unlawful calls as grounds for the ban, the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organisations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order.\\" (para.76) The Court found the ban disproportionate to the Government's stated aim of protecting children and vulnerable adults from homosexual propaganda. It also dismissed the Government's claim that the march should have been banned for conflicting with religious doctrine and the moral values of the majority. It stated that, if a minority group's exercise of rights guaranteed under the Convention were made conditional upon acceptance of that group by the societal majority, it would be \\"incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention\\" (para.81). The Court responded to the statement by the Government that there was a lack of consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality, stating there was a long-standing consensus on such matters as legalisation of homosexual activity (Dudgeon v United Kingdom), homosexuals in the military (Smith and Grady v United Kingdom), parental rights, succession to tenancies (Karner v Austria), and equal ages of consent (S. L. v. Austria). While issues such as adoption by same-sex couples and access to same-sex marriage were yet to be brought to consensus, the Court found there was \\"no ambiguity about the other member States' recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly.\\" (para.84) The Court found that the Government had taken no steps to assess the risk posed should the marches have gone ahead. It stated, \\"The only factor taken into account by the Moscow authorities was the public opposition to the event, and the officials' own views on morals.\\" (para.85) The Government had failed to demonstrate any pressing social need to ban such demonstrations for any of the reasons it had given. The Court therefore found the ban not to have been necessary in a democratic society, and to have been a violation of the right to freedom of assembly under Article 11. =Article 13 (effective remedy)= Article 13 requires that within a member state a competent national authority must be able to provide a suitable domestic remedy to an aggrieved party, both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. As the Applicant's Article 11 right had been violated, he was entitled to such relief under Article 13. The Court stated that, in the circumstances, an appropriate remedy would have been for the Applicant to have been able to obtain a court ruling concerning the authorisation of the march before it was intended to take place. The Court found that the judicial remedies which had been available to the Applicant in the circumstances were of a post-hoc nature and could not have provided adequate redress to the Applicant, and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 13 (para. 99). =Article 14 (discrimination)= Article 14 protects against discrimination in access to rights under the Convention. Because it relates to access to rights, it can only be used in conjunction with another article, in this case Article 11. Parties' submissions The Government claimed that the antagonistic nature of the relationship between sexual minorities and religious groups in Russia meant it was necessary to place restrictions on the exercise of certain rights. The Applicant responded that the ban was discriminatory as it had been put in place due to the government of Moscow's disapproval of the participants' homosexuality. He referred to reference made by the Government to the disapproval of religious groups towards the march, and to comments made in the media by the Mayor of Moscow which were unfavourable towards homosexuality. Findings of the Court The Court stated that homosexuality was a ground for discrimination under Article 14, and that the margin of appreciation afforded to member states in this regard was narrow. It was necessary to show not just that measures taken were \\"suitable in general\\", but that they were \\"necessary in the circumstances\\" (para.108), and that if the sole reason put forward by a member state for restrictions on access to the Convention rights were the victims' homosexuality, it would amount to discrimination under Article 14. The Court found on the facts that the march participants' sexual orientation had been the main reason for banning the events, and that there had therefore been a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 11. =Just satisfaction= The Applicant had claimed ‚Ç¨40,000 in non-pecuniary damages, of which the Government was ordered to pay ‚Ç¨12,000, as well as ‚Ç¨17,510 in costs.

Cornell was known for empirical drawings and paintings. His work involved moral content concerning global, social, and environmental justice. He was the Richard E. Steele Artist-in-Residence at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine until June 2012 when he formally retired. Biography Thomas Cornell was born March 1, 1937 in Cleveland, Ohio. Cornell studied art at Amherst College (B.A., 1959) and at Yale University School of Art and Architecture (1959‚Äì1960). In 1960, Thomas Cornell became a professor of art at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1962, Cornell became a professor of visual art at Bowdoin College, where he taught until his death. He was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1969‚Äì70. In 2001 Bowdoin College appointed Cornell the Richard E. Steele Professor of Visual Arts. In his early career, Cornell was known mainly for drawings and prints. Cornell's prints were included in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, Philadelphia Print Club, DeCordova Museum, University of San Diego, Brooklyn Museum, the National Council of Fine Arts and elsewhere.Ro Gallery, http://rogallery.com/Cornell_Thomas/Cornell-bio.html During this time, Cornell also founded his own publishing house, called Tragos Press, and printed editions of books and broadsides. In 1972, the New-York-based Associated American Artists held a one-man exhibition of Cornell's prints.Id. Later Cornell turned primarily to oil painting. This included both large narrative compositions and landscapes. In 1969, Cornell's anti-war triptych \\"Dance of Death\\" was featured in the travelling museum exhibition of young New England painters. In 1985, Cornell was commissioned by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company to create a four seasons set of paintings to hang in their corporate headquarters in Boston. Beginning in 1987, Cornell devoted himself to a series of large figurative paintings concerning community. His later work has incorporated the coastal landscape of Maine. Later on in life, Tom Cornell became involved in Occupy Brunswick, a grassroots movement fighting for local change and justice. He was working on an activist piece for the movement at the time of his death. Thomas Cornell's Art Cornell's art revolves around themes of social justice and mankind's relationship with nature. Critic Martica Sawin states: \\"Unlike many artists who are involved with the art- making act to such an extent that medium and process become dominant over intentionality, Cornell puts the idea before the act. Art for him has from the start been a means of giving form to a specific socially significant theme.\\"Martica Sawin, Paintings ‚Äì The Birth of Nature, Michael Kammen refers to Cornell's more recent work as having adopted \\"a pastoral style that highlighted lyrical celebrations of life and nature. He sought to create images of people so beautiful that they would inspire people to change their lives.\\"Michael Kammen, A Time To Every Purpose (2004), p.249. Museum curator Karl Nickel says, in reference to Cornell's Dance of Death, \\"It is a splendid and civilized thing to see an artist aroused, to sense both the Olympian authority of his accusation and the humanity of his understanding.\\"Karl Nickel, catalogue, Young New England Painters, 1969, pp.5‚Äì8. =Awards and membership= Cornell has received the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (1961), the Fulbright Grant (1966), the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Fellowship (1966‚Äì67), Ford Foundation Grant (1969‚Äì70), and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (1993).

The name has many variations and derivations, mainly as a result of the difficulty for non-Welsh speakers of representing the sound of the initial double ll (a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative). The name Lewis became closely associated with Llywelyn as early as the 13th century, when Anglo-Norman scribes often used the former as an anglicised version of the latter; many Welsh families came to do the same over the following centuries as the adoption of formal English-style surnames became more widespread. Etymology The name evolved from the Old British name Lugubelinos, which was a compound of two names for Celtic deities. The first, Lugus, is also the source of the first element in the names Llywarch and Lliwelydd, and, as an independent name, evolved into Welsh Lleu. The second element, Belenus, evolved as an independent name into Welsh Belyn. History Llywelyn the Great's arms became associated with the name for later generations. The arms are described as: Blazoned Quarterly or and gules, four lions passant guardant two and two counterchanged langued and armed Azure.The arms and flag have four squares alternating in red (representing iron, or Mars the god of War) and gold (representing the royalty of the Aberffraw house); with a walking lion (\\"passant\\") in each square of the opposite colour; with the lion's paw upraised and with the lion's face viewing the observer (\\"guardant\\": guarding against trespass); the tongue is stuck-out (\\"langued\\", tauntingly) and blue (\\"Azur\\"), and the outstretched claws (\\"armed\\") are blue (\\"Azur\\", representing saphires, or the god Jupiter; for primacy in Wales). The name Llywelyn became popular following the successes of Llywelyn the Great (r. 1195-1240), but was largely absent among Welsh princes prior to him.Llywelyn ab Iorwerth may have been named after his mother's brother, Llywelyn ap Madog of the Mathrafal house of Powys Fadog. Prior to this, the name Llywelyn does not appear in any of the genealogies for the Aberffraw princes of Gwynedd or Dinefwr princes of Deheubarth Although Llywelyn was the most common form of the name in the medieval period, variant spellings started emerging even in the early Middle Ages, in particular Llewelyn and Llewellyn,Morgan and Morgan (1985: p. 147) note that the double ll in Llewellyn reflects English spelling conventions, but is misleading with respect to pronunciation, since the initial ll is pronounced differently from the later ll. spellings that gave rise to a folk belief that the name was connected with lions (the Welsh word for lion being llew). This belief was further reinforced by Llywelyn the Great's adoption of his father Iorwerth ab Owain's coat of arms, incorporating four lions. The association also produced another early variant of the name, Leoline (based on Latin leo), commonly used in Norman French and French manuscripts. In medieval Latin manuscripts, the form Lewelinus was used. A number of other variants have arisen, however, including Elilevelin, Ffuellen, Ffuellin, Fflellen, Flawelling, Fleuellen, Flewellin, Flewellen, Flewelling, Flewellyn, Fluellen, Fluellin, Fluelling, Flwellin, Fowellen, Fuelling, Lawellins, Lawellen, Leoloni, Lewallen, Lewlin, Lewilin, Llallin, Lleulin, Lleulini, Llewen, Leuleijon, Llewelling, Llewellinge, Llewellen, Llewhellin, Llewhelyn, Llewillin, Lluellen, Luellen, Thewell, Thewelinus, Thellyn, Thelen, Thewelling, Thelwelin, Thlewelyn, and Swellin. Some of these spellings reflect attempts by English and Norman writers to represent the initial consonant: An alternative strategy was to substitute a similar-sounding name. Indeed, Anglo- Norman clerks followed a deliberate policy of substituting Anglo-Norman names for Welsh ones, and the name Lewis came to be used for Llywelyn as early as the 13th century, based on the apparent similarity of the first syllable to the first syllable of the name Louis (especially if the first syllable of Llywelyn was spelt Llew). The interchangeability of Llywelyn and Lewis could go both ways: Other examples include Lewis Glyn Cothi who was known as Llywelyn y Glyn, and Lewys Morgannwg whose bardic name was Llywelyn ap Rhisiart. =Derived forms= Three feminine forms have been derived from Llywelyn - Llywela, Llewellanne, Loella and Louella- as well as two hypocoristic forms, Llelo and Llela (usually considered male and female, respectively). The hypocoristic forms are always pronounced (and sometimes spelt) with an initial [l], rather than with the alveolar fricative represented in Welsh by ll. =Associated surnames= Apart from variants mentioned above, surnames originating from Llywelyn include Apswellen, Bewellin, Bewlyn, Bewlen, Pawelin, Weallins, Wellings, Wellins, Welyn, Wellyns, Wellens, Wellence, Wellon, and Wellys. Surnames beginning Ap-, B-, or P- are based on the Welsh patronymic naming system, where ap or ab (\\"son of\\") was used with the father's first name. As Welsh people came to adopt Anglo- Norman-style surnames, ap was either incorporated into the name as in Apswellen or Pawelin, dropped entirely as in (Lly)Welyn, or replaced with an -s at the end of the name as in Wellyns (see Welsh surnames). In some regions of England the surname Welling may derive from an English place-name, but in Welsh Marcher counties its frequency suggests that it can be traced back to (Lly)welyn. More common than any of these surnames is the surname Lewis (see above), with its related variants Lewes, Lewys, Lowys, Lowis, Llewys, Llewis, Llwys, Llewes. A Latinised variant, Leodovicus, re-entered English as Lodwick, Ludwick, Lotwick, and Lodowick, names that are especially common in South Wales. As the name Lewis was in use before the abandonment of the patronomic system in Wales, Morgan and Morgan (1985) note that ‚Äúit is difficult to understand why ap Lewis did not result in a surname Blewis.\\" Notes References * Given names Surnames Surnames of Welsh origin Celtic-language surnames Surnames of British Isles origin ","title":"Llywelyn (name)"},{"id":"30135952","text":"Ectoedemia permira is a moth of the family Nepticulidae.

A stereotypy is a term for a group of phenotypic behaviours that are repetitive, morphologically identical and which possess no obvious goal or function. These behaviours have been defined as ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô as they exhibit themselves solely to animals subjected to barren environments, scheduled or restricted feedings, social deprivation and other cases of frustration, but do not arise in ‚Äònormal‚Äô animals in their natural environments. These behaviours may be maladaptive, involving self-injury or reduced reproductive success, and in laboratory animals can confound behavioural research. Stereotypical behaviours are thought to be caused ultimately by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioural needs. Rather than refer to the behaviour as abnormal, it has been suggested that it be described as \\"behaviour indicative of an abnormal environment.\\" Stereotyped behaviour can also refer to normal behaviours that show low variation. For example, mammalian chewing cycles or fish capturing prey using suction feeding. Highly stereotyped movements may be due to mechanical constraint (such as the skull of a viper or fish, in which bones are mechanically linked), tight neural control (as in mammalian chewing), or both. The degree of stereotyping may vary markedly between closely related species engaging in the same behaviour.  Onset and persistence  An exploratory sniffing behaviour that may lead to the development of the wire-gnawing stereotypy in a caged mouse The display of stereotypies is usually increased in an individual over time due to the changing motivation of the stereotypy. The establishment of a stereotypy may be due to a number of factors within a captive environment. One of the factors within a captive environment that may affect the establishment of stereotypies is exploratory behaviours that are directed to the outside of a cage. Research suggests that some common stereotypic behaviours seen in mice, wire-gnawing for example, may originate from such exploratory behaviours. It has been noted that when mice climb on the bars of the cage, they frequently attempt to sniff outside the cage by putting their nose between the bars of the cage. During this process, mice will occasionally bite the bars. Over time, the frequency of biting the bar increases while the frequency of sniffing decreases until the mice are left with only the wire-gnawing stereotypy. Although there is strong evidence to suggest that the development of stereotypies is influenced by exploratory behaviours, the mechanisms behind these exploratory behaviours are still unclear. They may be the result of some attractive stimuli outside of the cage or they may result from a motivation to escape the cage. The continuance of a stereotypic behaviour can be explained by its impact on the basal ganglia and the establishment of a habit in its expression. Research in humans suggests that damage to the dorsal basal ganglia can make it very difficult for a person to switch between two motor behaviours, thus they will continuously perform the same behaviour. Similar difficulties in switching between motor behaviours have been seen in bank voles which suggests that basal ganglia dysfunction might be a factor in the development of stereotypies in rodents and other animals. The interruption or cease of a habit is much more tedious and difficult than that of the initial behaviour. As stereotypies develop, they become more readily elicited, so much so that they are no longer just expressed during the original circumstances and may be expressed in the absence of any apparent stress or conflict. The development of the stereotypy into a habit and the difficulty of interrupting said habit explain why it is expected that the frequency of stereotypies increases with age. There is also some research that suggests that the persistence of stereotypies might be due to behavioural differences between animals with stereotypies and those without. One of the behavioural differences that has been researched is a higher resistance to extinction seen in animals that exhibit stereotypic behaviours. Resistance to extinction occurs when animals are unable to stop a learned response. Research with domesticated dogs has shown that dogs who exhibit common stereotypic behaviours have higher resistance to extinction in a simple experimental task than other dogs. This correlation suggests that stereotypic behaviours in dogs may have been reinforced in some way early in their development and have persisted because these dogs are highly resistant to extinction.  Examples  Video of a mouse showing distinct amphetamine- induced stereotypy reminiscent of nail biting Many stereotypies can be induced by confinement; for example, cats pace in zoo cages. Pregnant sows whose feed is restricted bite at their stalls' bars and chew without anything in their mouths. In laboratory rats and mice, grooming is the most common activity other than sleep, and grooming stereotypies have been used to investigate several animal models of anxiety and depression. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, rocking, swimming in circles, excessive sleeping, self-mutilation (including feather picking and excessive grooming), and mouthing cage bars. Stereotypies are seen in many species, including primates, birds, and carnivores. Up to 54% of elephants in zoos display stereotypical behaviors. Stereotypic behaviour is also common in captive giraffes; although they perform a wide range of stereotypies, they predominantly lick inanimate objects, which may be related to limitations on natural foraging and feeding behaviour. Stereotypies are well known in stabled horses, usually developing as a result of being confined, particularly with insufficient exercise. They are colloquially called stable vices. They present a management issue, not only leading to facility damage from chewing, kicking, and repetitive motion, but also lead to health consequences for the animal if not addressed. Asiatic black bears and Malayan sun bears also exhibit stereotypies when they are caged. Common stereotypies in these species include head throwing and jaw clamping. Stereotypies can also be seen in dogs. Common stereotypic behaviours in dogs include circling, light fixation and fly snapping. Solutions Stereotypical behaviour can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by environmental enrichment, including larger and more stimulating enclosures, training, and introductions of stimuli (such as objects, sounds, or scents) to the animal's environment. The enrichment must be varied to remain effective for any length of time. Housing social animals such as primates with other members of their species is also helpful. However, once the behaviour is established, it is sometimes impossible to eliminate due to alterations in the brain.  Animal welfare  The development and continued expression of stereotypies in captive animals can quickly become an animal welfare concern. Stereotypies are considered one of the most important indicators of long-term animal welfare problems. A prolonged display of stereotypies suggests that the welfare of the animal is in a peril state. The welfare of the mink is considered an important aspect from a management standpoint as it has repercussions on the production of the animal. Inadequate welfare has been linked to poor reproductivity and poor growth rate.  Animal research  Extreme displays of stereotypies can be an animal welfare issue as well as a confound in behavioural research. Since much of the behavioural research done on animals requires the subject to have a certain level of normal behavioural functioning, any stereotypic behaviour exhibited by the subjects could compromise the results. However, expressions of stereotypic behaviour can also present a unique opportunity for researchers. Just as human research into basal ganglia dysfunction provided insight into the development of stereotypies in animals, animal research on stereotypic behaviours may help understand the neuronal mechanisms behind many of the motor stereotypies seen in human clinical populations.

History =Early years= The band formed in Glendale, California on January 1, 2000 and originally consisted of Nicolette Vilar (lead vocals), Betty Cisneros (guitar), Aixa Vilar (drums), and Michelle Rangel (bass). Nicolette and Aixa are sisters. The name originates from a phrase the band used to chant to try to get guitarist, Betty Cisneros, to start a song. The band released two CDs for SideOneDummy Records. The first was \\"Worst Enemy\\" in 2004. The second was \\"Nothing Is More\\", produced by Flogging Molly‚Äôs Ted Hutt, in 2005.

In one town, while playing at a wedding, he is attracted to one of the guests, Rachel, a talented singer. She, discontented with her marriage to the boring Moyshe-Mendl, finds herself drawn in by Stempenyu's music, who likewise finds his love for her an escape from his jealous and miserly wife Freydl.

She and her husband move to a different town, where they have a child and he becomes a successful businessman; Stempenyu and Freydl remain unhappily married and childless, though she also becomes a successful shopkeeper.

In 1888, a Jesuit Priest named Father Diomedi arrived and hired an architect from Portland named Mr. Blanchard and a contractor from Missoula, Montana named Patrick Walsh. The church was designed to hold 600 on the main floor and another 150 in the choir loft. A description of the church can be found at www.sfxmissoula.com When the church was built in 1892, it became the largest church in Montana. It is a cruciform church in the Romanesque Revival style. The arches over the windows and doors are semicircular, and there are smaller arches along the eave line, small buttresses, and a bell tower. Jesuit lay brother Joseph Carignano (1853‚Äì1919), who also painted the frescoes at St. Ignatius Mission, painted the interior.

Full table scans are usually the slowest method of scanning a table due to the heavy amount of I/O reads required from the disk which consists of multiple seeks as well as costly disk to memory transfers.  Overview  In a database, a query that is not indexed results in a full table scan, where the database processes each record of the table to find all records meeting the given requirements. Even if the query selects just a few rows from the table, all rows in the entire table will be examined. This usually results in suboptimal performance but may be acceptable with very small tables or when the overhead of keeping indexes up to date is high.  When the Optimizer Considers a Full Table Scan  The most important factor in choosing depends on speed. This means that a full table scan should be used when it is the fastest and cannot use a different access path. Several full table scan examples are as follows. * No index The optimizer must use a full table scan since no index exists. * Small number of rows The cost of full table scan is less than index range scan due to small table. * When query processed SELECT COUNT(*), nulls existed in the column The query is counting the number of null columns in a typical index. However, SELECT COUNT(*) can't count the number of null columns. * The query is unselective The number of return rows is too large and takes nearly 100% in the whole table. These rows are unselective. * The table statistics does not update The number of rows in the table is higher than before, but table statistics haven't been updated yet. The optimizer can't correctly estimate that using the index is faster. * The table has a high degree of parallelism The high degree of parallelism table distorts the optimizer from a true way, because optimizer would use full table scan. * A full table scan hint The hint lets optimizer to use full table scan.  Example  A full table scan example: The example shows the SQL statement of searching items with id is bigger than 10 from table1 SELECT category_id1 FROM table1 WHERE category_id2 > 10; In this situation, the database system needs to scan full table to find the content which fits the requirement. The other example shows the SQL statement of searching employee information by their first name order SELECT first_name FROM employees ORDER BY first_name; In this situation, the database system also needs to scan full table to compare the first name.  Pros and Cons Pros: * The cost is predictable, as every time database system needs to scan full table row by row. * When table is less than 2 percent of database block buffer, the full scan table is quicker. Cons: * Full table scan occurs when there is no index or index is not being used by SQL. And the result of full scan table is usually slower that index table scan. The situation is that: the larger the table, the slower of the data returns. * Unnecessary full-table scan will lead to a huge amount of unnecessary I/O with a process burden on the entire database.

In the attack, a disgruntled individual, Clay Allen Duke, fired four shots at six Bay District School board members, but missed them all, including the superintendent. Duke was then shot several times by Head of Safety and Security Mike Jones, a retired police officer, before committing suicide. Much of the episode and its immediate aftermath were recorded by local television news stations WMBB and WJHG-TV. The video was subsequently uploaded to video sharing sites, including YouTube. Footage of the incident was also shown in a revival season episode of World's Wildest Police Videos. Incident At 2:00 p.m. on December 14, 2010, Duke stood up during a school board meeting in Panama City, Florida, and said, \\"I have a motion.\\" He then promptly pulled out a can of red spray paint and sprayed a \\"V\\" inside a circle, as seen in the film V for Vendetta. He then produced a 9mm Smith & Wesson 469 semiautomatic pistol, causing other staff near the bench and audience members to duck for cover. He aimed the gun at the board members and used it to point to two women, saying, \\"You may leave, and you may leave...the women can leave...The six men stay, everyone else leave.\\" After the room was evacuated, Duke told the board members he was upset that his wife had been fired from her job as an English teacher in the Panama City district. The superintendent, Bill Husfelt, after an approximately four-minute discussion, tried to negotiate with Duke, saying, \\"I'm the only one who signs [the papers], will you let them [the other board members] go?\\" Duke denied his requests to allow the other board members to leave, saying, \\"They're part of it.\\" Husfelt then argued with Duke about his threat, saying, \\"For what? [Referring to Duke's threat to kill himself] This isn't worth it.\\" Duke raised the pistol and leveled it at the superintendent. Husfelt started to hold his arms to his chest, saying, \\"Please don't, please don't, please...\\" Duke fired, hitting the table in front of Husfelt, who dropped to the floor. The board members dived to the ground behind the desk. Duke then fired a second shot into the floor of the room, saying \\"I'm going to kill you\\", just as a responding security guard, Mike Jones, opened fire on Duke. After being hit by one of Jones' rounds, Duke fired two or three more times behind the table. Despite four or five shots being fired from Duke's gun, no board members were hit. He was shot again by Jones and fell to the ground. Duke blindly fired six more shots at Jones, then pointed the gun at his head and committed suicide. Jones was not injured, but was taken to the hospital for chest pains. According to his wife, Duke was an excellent marksman and likely missed his targets intentionally. Jones later stated, \\"I thought I'd let them down. I opened the door with one hand and was firing with the other. ...I don't know how I survived with all those shots fired.\\" He also added, \\"I'm not a hero, folks.\\" Minutes after the shooting, WMBB uploaded the video to YouTube and other sites, where it received more than 1,000,000 views in less than a week. Hostage-taker Clay Duke Clay Allen Duke (November 24, 1954 ‚Äì December 14, 2010) was a 56-year-old unemployed Floridian who was apparently disgruntled over the firing of his wife by the school board. He was described by the Associated Press as a \\"troubled, broke ex-con with bipolar disorder, an interest in anarchy, a wife whose unemployment benefits had run out and frustrations that reached their boiling point on a day circled on his calendar at home\\". Duke had previously been convicted of aggravated stalking and attempted ambush with a rifle in 1999 and 2000, respectively. While in prison, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but was unable to afford treatment after his release. Although Duke was sentenced to five years in prison in 2000, he was released in January 2004, at which point he became a licensed massage therapist, according to state records. =Motive= Duke was reportedly unhappy with the school board for terminating his wife's teaching job in the Panama City district. In addition, Duke felt a particular sales tax was unfair because it hurt lower-income families more than the wealthy. Prior to the shooting, Duke spray-painted a red circle with a 'V' inside it‚Äîan allusion to the film, V for Vendetta. Duke posted to his Facebook page a week before the shootings: Duke was noted several times as saying that he planned to die in the shooting. Ginger Littleton Duke removed the gun from his pocket and told everyone in the room to leave, aside from the male board members seated at the elevated podium. On her way out, board member Ginger Littleton turned back into the room and attempted to disarm Duke by whacking his pistol with her purse. The attempt failed and Littleton was knocked to the floor; Duke did not shoot, instead simply threatening her inaudibly (Littleton later said that he called her a \\"stupid bitch\\" ), and making her leave the room at gunpoint. A week after the shootings, the purse that Littleton used to hit Duke sold on the online auction site eBay for $13,000, with the proceeds going to charity.

History This place was in the pre-Islamic place of worship of the Zoroastrian and used it as a fire or temple of fire, and is about 2,300 years old. This structure was initially used as a Zoroastrian Fire Temple during the Sassanid period, however, after the fall of the Sassanid Empire it was converted into a mosque in the 8th century. The monument is, thus, known as the oldest mosque in Iran. Etymology Tarikhaneh means historic in Persian. Other names as Tarik Khaneh (Dark House) or Turkish origin (which has no meaning in Turkish) are false. Architecture and design This place was in the pre-Islamic place of worship of the Zoroastrians and used it as a fire or temple of fire, and is about 2,300 years old. Before the arrival of Islam to Iran and the Qomes area, the people of this city used this place as the ritual of religious ceremonies of Zoroastrian religion. The main plan consists of a square courtyard which is surrounded by arcades of barrel vaults supported by slightly pointed fired brick arches set on rather stumpy circular pillars, typical of the Sassanid architecture. The pillars are 3.5 meters tall and almost 2 meters in diameter. Standing together at a distance from the mosque are the remains of a square column of uncertain date, possibly part of the original construction period, and a cylindrical minaret from the Seljuk period. The latter was built in 1026‚Äì1029 to replace an older 9th century minaret, and is strikingly divided into six zones of ornamentation, each rendered in brick with a different geometric pattern. The minaret is 4.2 meters in diameter; its top has fallen, but originally it must have measured more the 30 meters high, with a gallery supported on muqarnas corbels.

The oldest part of the house dates from the early 1830s, and it is thought to be the oldest structure in the city. The house was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1992. History The house was built in 1832 or 1833 by George L. Davenport, son of Colonel George Davenport, when he was fifteen years old, It was built as a claim on his property and is thought to be the oldest structure in the city of Davenport. At that time the property was on land that had not yet been open to white settlement. The claim was made when the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes were being forced to surrender their lands following the Black Hawk War, and the area became known as the Black Hawk Purchase. Davenport was on friendly terms with the tribes and had their permission to settle on the land. Another early settler Dr. John Emerson took up a claim to the east and built a structure where he housed his slave Dred Scott. The house was constructed of materials brought from Cincinnati, Ohio by way of the Mississippi River. The original structure measured , with subsequent additions including a lean-to kitchen. When looking at the front of the house there is a batten between the first and second windows from the left. The original house is to the right of the batten. A brick chimney replaces the original which was constructed of stone. The furthest window on the right side of the house was originally the location of the door into the house. In 1867, the house was dismantled and moved from its original location to its present location. The property was covered in a 1982 and/or a 1983 study of Davenport's historic buildings.

The estate in which the masia is located is called a mas. They are often large but isolated structures, nearly always associated with a family farming or livestock operation. Through the ages, the materials used to construct masies varied, often determined by their location. In mountainous areas, rough stone was often used, except for doorways, windows and arches, where stone was worked. During the Middle Ages, mud was used as mortar, though later on it was replaced by quicklime or cement. In places where stone was hard to come by, adobe was more common as a construction material. For the most part, masies are oriented to the south. Constructions older than 16th century have an arched main entrance while those built after the 18th century usually have lintel entrances. Masies were typically constructed with wooden beams placed perpendicular to the facade and covered by tiles. In the Pyrenees and other mountainous areas, the roofing would often be made of slate. They tended to be at least two-story buildings, with the ground floor reserved for farming tasks and even housing livestock, with the upper floor reserved for the family's living quarters. If there was a floor above that, it would often be used as a granary, or occasionally to house pigeons. Occasionally, masies include an annexed private chapel. In modern times, many masies have been converted into residential villas, restaurants, bed and breakfasts, or centers for rural tourism. Some house museums (i.e. Vil¬∑la Joana, Jujol Centre - Can Negre) or have been restored and adapted for cultural uses. Some early works of the Catalan painter Joan Mir√≥ depict his family's own masia as well as Catalan peasants. FC Barcelona The FC Barcelona youth academy is called La Masia, so named because it was formerly located in an authentic 18th-century masia called the 'Masia de Can Planes'. The masia is located adjacent to the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona, and was used to house young footballers from 1979 to 2011.

The projection was for the number of elementary- aged students to rise by almost three thousand students between 1930 and 1950, but no building plan based on these projections was prepared.

He was the second Director of the S√ªret√© Nationale of the Congo. Nendaka died on 22 August 2002 while in exile in Brussels. Early life and family Victor Nendaka was born on 7 August 1923 in Kumu, Buta Territory, Bas-Uele District in Orientale Province, Belgian Congo. He was the only child to his mother Tabapaya Elisabeth and father Angada Gabriel. However, he had stepsisters and stepbrothers, among whom were Goningame Josephine and Pae Pierre. Victor went to the Fr√®res Maristes School in Buta. He married Astrid Mbooto in 1943. They had six children: Gabrielle, Andre, Monique, Claude, Victorine and Astrid. He died in exile on 22 August 2002 in Brussels.  Career  left Nendaka left the MNC-L ostensibly because Lumumba accepted a significant amount of money from communists, but he never presented any substantial evidence to support his allegation. In October 1960 Nendaka was appointed Director of the S√ªret√© Nationale (national security police) by temporary commission. He swiftly reorganised the agency and transformed it into an effective intelligence- gathering service. Soon a ginger group formed in the Congolese government in support of eventual Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula known as the Binza Group. Nendaka, in his capacity as S√ªret√© Director, was a key member. On 13 December 1961, Minister of Interior Christophe Gbenye attempted to assert his control over the S√ªret√©; his cabinet released a communique stating that, effective 12 December, Nendaka no longer worked for the service and was open to reassignment in the government. Nendaka appealed to General Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu for support, who immediately responded by sending troops to guard the S√ªret√© offices and threaten Gbenye with arrest if he interfered. Five days later an ordinance signed 15 July appeared in the official government gazette, Moniteur Congolais, declaring the nomination of Nendaka by the President of the Congo as Director of the S√ªret√©, effective 1 July. Nendaka thereafter reported directly to Prime Minister Adoula. Nendaka was nearly assassinated by members of the anti-Adoula Comit√© National de Lib√©ration in November 1963. He was Minister of Finance from August 1968 to August 1969.

He served as the 6th Milwaukee County Executive from 2011 to 2020. Abele is the son of American businessman John Abele, the co-founder of Boston Scientific. Abele serves as a trustee of the Argosy Foundation, a charitable trust established with an endowment from his father. Business career In 1996, Abele, with Chris Kerr, founded SteriLogic Waste Systems, which serves hospitals and medical clinics in managing sharps waste. Abele served as CEO of SteriLogic from 1996‚Äì2004. In 2004, Abele became Chairman of the company to devote more time to philanthropic efforts. In 2006, SteriLogic merged with Medsolutions and in 2007, Kerr and Abele sold the majority of SteriLogic to Stericycle. The remainder of SteriLogic was restructured the remainder as Oxus Environmental. In 2001, Abele and his business partner Steve Mech founded CSA Commercial, a Milwaukee-based real estate and development company. Prior to his election as Milwaukee County Executive, Abele served as CEO of the Argosy Foundation. In 2011, Abele stepped down as CEO and was replaced by his sister, Jeneye. Abele remains a trustee of the foundation. Abele invested $10 million into a venture fund, CSA Partners LLC, for Milwaukee start-ups. The LLC was formed with Brian Taffora and Pat Farley. They invested into gener8tor's Fund II and opened Ward 4 (Milwaukee, WI startup accelerator space) in remodelled space inside the former John Pritzlaff Hardware Company Building. 2011 Milwaukee County Executive race On January 4, 2011, Abele formally announced that he entered the race for Milwaukee County Executive. Abele and Stone received the most votes and advanced on to a run-off election that was held on April 5, 2011. On April 6, 2011, Abele defeated Republican challenger Jeff Stone, and was sworn in on April 21, 2011. =Issue positions= Ideology and party affiliation Abele contributed primarily to Democratic campaigns and the Democratic Party. Formerly, Abele served on a number of finance committees. This included the 2002 campaign for former Governor Jim Doyle, where he helped with John Kerry's presidential fundraising, and donated to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Daniel Bice reported that Abele donated to the campaigns of Republican state legislators including Joe Sanfelippo and Dale Kooyenga, both of whom have played roles in the passage of bills that have increased Abele's power as Milwaukee County executive. Endorsements On February 12, 2011, Abele received the endorsement of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which stated \\"Chris Abele's leadership on nonprofit boards, his experience running two family companies and his skill managing the Argosy Foundation make him a solid choice for county executive\\", and \\"Abele has the right experience and the right vision. Abele could be a game-changer\\". On April 2, 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel once again endorsed Abele over Jeff Stone, stating \\"Milwaukee County needs transformative change. One candidate provides the better chance to accomplish that.\\" Milwaukee County Executive Abele took the oath of office to become Milwaukee County Executive on April 25, 2011, succeeding Interim County Executive Marvin Pratt. On June 9, 2011, citing concerns about budget cuts at the state level, Abele indicated his opposition to a planned $775,000 investment in public art at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. A year later, in June 2012, Abele signed a resolution placing the public art program on \\"hiatus\\" and authorizing use of the program's $500,000 in accumulated funds toward deferred maintenance instead of artwork. On June 10, 2011 he announced his intention to provide health care coverage to domestic partners of Milwaukee County employees. This was approved by the County Board on July 28, 2011, and signed into law by Abele on August 3, 2011. Abele declined to seek re-election in 2020. Personal life Abele grew up in Concord, Massachusetts, but after attending college at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin from 1991‚Äì95, he decided to stay in Milwaukee. He is previously divorced and has three children.

It deals with the atrocities of World War I. The poem was written sometime in 1918 and was published in 1919 after Owen's death. The poem is narrated by a soldier who goes to the underworld to escape the hell of the battlefield and there he meets the enemy soldier he killed the day before. This poem has been described as one of Owen's \\"most haunting and complex war poems\\". Pararhyme or double consonance is a particular feature of the poetry of Wilfred Owen and also occurs throughout \\"Strange Meeting\\" ‚Äì the whole poem is written in pararhyming couplets. For example: \\"And by his smile I knew that sullen _hall_ , / By his dead smile I knew we stood in _Hell_.\\" The pararhyme here links key words and ideas, without detracting from the meaning and solemnity of the poem, as a full rhyme sometimes does. However, the failure of two similar words to rhyme and the obvious omission of a full rhyme creates a sense of discomfort and incompleteness. It is a discordant note that matches well to the disturbing mood of the poem. This poem is the final one of Owen's poems set in the War Requiem of Benjamin Britten. It is sung by the tenor and baritone soloists accompanied by chamber orchestra, joined at the closing line \\"Let us sleep now...\\" by the full forces of orchestra, organ, and soprano soloist, mixed chorus and children's chorus, singing Latin texts. The line \\"I am the enemy you killed, my friend\\" appears on the memorial sculpture to Owen erected by Wilfred Owen Association, (sculptors husband-and-wife Paul and Ruth de Monchaux) in the grounds of Shrewsbury Abbey (in whose parish his family settled) to mark his birth centenary in 1993.

The PortMiami Deep Dredge Project was a project that expanded PortMiami by dredging the bay to allow new, larger cargo ships to enter the port. The project was related to the \\"New Panamax\\" project that was completed in 2016 that involved a major expansion of the Panama Canal. The port, which was 42 feet deep,http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/08/21/1785682/port-of-miami-puts-rail- project.html was dredged to 50 feet in depth to allow the new Super Post Panamax megaships to enter. This project also coincided with the Port Miami Tunnel project, which was completed in 2014, that allows trucks to bypass Downtown Miami, resulting in twice the traffic capacity to the port. The ports of New York, Norfolk, and Baltimore have already undergone these projects. The Deep Dredge, along with port facility improvements such as the addition of two new large gantry cranes, made PortMiami capable of berthing even the next largest container vessels in the world, the Maersk Triple E Class, which has a draught of and is nearly wide, and was completed in 2015.http://www.miamidade.gov/portmiami/press_releases/2016-04-12-panama- canal-era.asp Overview Deep Dredge banner at the PortMiami entrance PortMiami is the closest US port to the Panama Canal, making it the most desired port for the new ships using the Panama Canal. Other ports competing for government funding in similar projects include Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, and ports in Tampa, Jacksonville, Savannah and Charleston. Aside from Miami being the only southeastern port that had given a nominal price for the project (180 million), the distance dredged was less than that of other ports, at 2.5 miles. As of December 2010, the port had already secured $17.5 million from the state and $120 million from the county for the project, which has been authorized by Congress. One notable issue is opposition to the use of state and federal earmarks, which the port had been seeking to use to get the funding.http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/08/1964584/in-visit-to-port-of- miami-scott.html GOP leaders in Congress are attempting to ban earmarks; the amount of this federal money Bill Johnson is seeking to fund the Deep Dredge is 75 million. In Dec. 2010 then Governor elect Rick Scott, promised to reignite the state's economy and spur job growth, visited the port to learn about the project, but did not take a side. He said that \\"It appears to make all the sense in the world\\" but also said \\"I don't support any earmarks,\\". If Miami does not get the funding and the dredging is not done by 2014, South Florida may lose trade traffic to nearby ports such as Freeport, a foreign port in the Bahamas, which is already 50 feet. Four ports in Florida are being considered for expansion, Tampa, Miami, Jacksonville, and Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. With the correct funding, PortMiami estimated that it would be capable of completing such a project by 2014, estimating that it will take 18 months to complete. It is also estimated that this project could double Miami's cargo business in the next 10 years as well as creating over 30,000 permanent jobs for Miami, which currently has a very high unemployment rate.http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/18/1978869/november-unemployment-rose- across.html In 2010 the port supported 176,000 jobs and $17 billion annually. This project had been advocated greatly by PortMiami Director Bill Johnson as well as Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado, and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez, as well as other elected officials. It is also supported by local media.http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/07/1960732/dredge-baby-dredge.html The World Trade Center Miami argued that the funding necessary to complete the project is only a small fraction of the $3 billion in federal aid rejected by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to improve rail infrastructure between New York City and New Jersey.http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/03/1954920/give- us-federal-funds-to-dredge.html History In March 2011, governor Rick Scott amended the $77 million loan needed to go ahead with the project. The funds were not included in the Obama Administration's new budget, they were instead taken out of a $7 billion Florida transportation fund. Rick Scott announced this at the same time he declined a $2.4 billion grant to fund the proposed Florida High Speed Rail system.http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/03/04/2098413/scott-to-fund-port-of- miami- project.html?asset_id=Bill%20Johnson%2C%20Port%20of%20Miami%20director&asset;_type=html_module In 2011, Obama cut the $75 million of funding that was supposed to pay for half the cost of the two mile dredging.

Early life and education Geller was born in Vinnytsia, the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) in 1889. He studied art in Odessa and continued his studies after moving to Montreal in 1906 where he immigrated to Canada. He married and moved to Chicago in 1918, where he studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago until 1923. Career Geller produced paintings, woodcuts, woodcarvings, and etchings. His work focused on Jewish tradition, often including moralistic themes and social commentary, shtetl, ghetto life, and the intersection of Jewish tradition with modern-day Chicago. He regarded art as a tool for social reform and he spent a large part of his career teaching art. His work was commissioned for stained glass windows, bookplates, community centers and Yiddish and English books. He was regarded as a leader in the field of synagogue and religious art. He designed stained glass windows for synagogues in Omaha, Fort Worth, Dayton, Stamford, and Chicago Heights. Over the course of his career he illustrated more than 40 books. =Teaching art= In addition to conducting classes in his studio, Geller was head of art at the Jewish People's Institute (JPI), supervisor of art for the Board of Jewish Education and director of art for the College of Jewish Studies (which became the Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership) and taught at Hull House. Many prominent Chicago artists studied drawing and painting under Geller. Geller was a source of inspiration to Aaron Bohrod and Mitchell Siporin, among others. Irean Gordon was also among his pupils. L. M. Shteyn Farlag logo (1937) =The L. M. Shteyn Farlag= In 1926, Geller formed what would become a lengthy working relationship with Chicago publisher and cultural activist L. M. Shteyn (a pseudonym for Yitshak Leyb Fradkin, anglicized as L.M. Stein in his English language correspondence). Shteyn and Geller shared a similar ideology, were both considered radical progressives, were part of the Chicago Jewish Left who worked to promote the Yiddish language and they both supported the Soviet Union for its commitment to the Yiddish language and to the Jewish settlement in Birobidzhan. Shteyn's Yiddish press, the L. M. Shteyn Farlag, published at least eight monographs illustrated by Geller and four art albums dedicated to his work. =Art and activism= In 1923, the Chicago Hebrew Institute's Observer (a forerunner of today's Jewish Community Center's), included Geller as one of the \\"many well known artists\\" to have their works listed in an art exhibit catalogue. Geller was one of the founding members of \\"Around the Palette\\" in Chicago in 1926, a club where artists shared their personal views of art and its role in society. The club became the \\"American Jewish Art Club\\", in 1940 and subsequently the \\"American Jewish Artists Club\\" in the early 1990s. Other founding members included Emil Armin, David Bekker, Aaron Bohrod, Fritzi Brod, Samuel Greenburg, William S. Schwartz, Maurice Yochim and Louise Dunn Yochim. In 1929, Geller visited Palestine, where he was inspired to paint Biblical themes such as his painting Jerusalem the Old which was included in the catalogue of the Art Institute of Chicago's thirty-third annual exhibition. He also created a woodcut series entitled Seven Palestinian motifs cut on wood in 1930. expulsion of the Jews from Spain In 1931, Geller provided illustrations for Rose G Lurie's book, The Great March: Post Biblical Jewish Stories, a selection of Jewish stories for children covering the period from the destruction of the First Temple to the expulsion from Spain. The book was published by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and was intended to cultivate \\"a love for Jewish heroes, for the Jewish people, and for Jewish idealism.\\" John Drury, in his 1931 review of the Cafe Royale, \\"an intellectual and artistic rendezvous of the west side Jewish quarter\\", for his book Dining in Chicago, included \\"Todros Geller, the wood-block artist\\" as one of the \\"local Jewish celebrities in the arts and allied interests\\" who dined there. In 1932, Geller participated in the Grant Park Art Fair organized by Adeline Loebdell Atwater, Chicago's first open-air art fair. According to Sarah Abrevaya Stein, professor of history and Maurice Amado Chair in Sephardic Studies at UCLA, inexpensive reproductions of Geller's art were popular with Chicago's Jewish Left in the 1930s, particularly a picture of a traditionally dressed Jewish man standing below the tracks of one of Chicago's elevated trains. Geller regarded art as a tool for social reform. In 1936, he signed the call for the first American Artists' Congress \\"Against War and Fascism\\". In the summer of 1936, the Chicago Society of Artists published their first annual block-print calendar called The Artist Calendar ‚Äì 1937 that featured woodcuts by 30 Chicago artists, including Geller. The calendar project was intended to raise funds for the society activities and expose Chicago artists to a wider audience. He was the most prominent of the 14 graphic artists who participated in A Gift to Biro-Bidjan in 1937, an album of 14 woodcuts produced as a fund-raising project for the Chicago ICOR (whose acronym comes from the Yiddish name for the Association for Jewish Colonization in the Soviet Union) to support the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Geller's contribution to the portfolio was a woodcut based on Raisins and Almonds, the Yiddish lullaby written by Abraham Goldfaden in 1880 for his operetta Shulamis. The woodcut shows several scenes as a boy grows up and travels from Eastern Europe to Chicago: the boy's mother and a goat surrounding his cradle, the boy studying, the grown man walking with a sack on his back passing an open market, the man working as a tailor to earn money to immigrate to the New World, and a scene of an elevated train and the smokestacks of Chicago with unemployed workers demonstrating with banners and flags. The last scene, on the theme of new hope, shows the man standing looking up and grasping a newly planted tree. The other artists who contributed woodcuts were Alex Topchevsky, William Jacobs, Aaron Bohrod, David Bekker, Louis Weiner, Mitchell Siporin, Edward Millman, Fritzi Brod, Bernece Berkman, Morris Topchevsky, Abraham Weiner, Raymond Katz, and Ceil Rosenberg. From Land to Land (1937) endpapers In 1937, Shteyn published a volume of about sixty woodcuts by Geller called From Land to Land, produced as part of the Federal Art Project (FAP), the visual arts arm of the Great Depression-era New Deal Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal One program in the United States. The cover featured a goat on the shore of Lake Michigan with Chicago's skyline in the background. As an important staple of Jewish life in Eastern Europe that were believed to have mystical qualities, goats were a dominant symbol in Geller's artistic vocabulary. The woodcuts, four of which were in color, illustrated Jewish life, in addition to Native American, Spanish, Mexican, and Midwestern American themes. Oklahoma Indian dancer (1936) In May 1938, the Osage Tribal Museum in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, opened to the public. It was the first tribally owned museum in the United States, and was built with support from a WPA- sponsored program for the preservation of Native American culture. As part of Osage Tribal Councilman John Joseph Mathews' efforts to conserve Osage culture, Mathews obtained a second grant from the Federal Art Project to finance an art project commissioned for the museum's opening that included oil portraits of Osage elders posing in various costumes. Geller, who had spent time in the Southwest studying and painting Native American Indians, supervised the art project and painted around twelve of the portraits. Geller's paintings are displayed at the museum. Geller painted The Accordion Player in 1938 as part of the WPA Federal Art Project, an oil painting in the collection of the MacNider Art Museum in Mason City, Iowa. Geller provided illustrations for some of the Nebraska Folklore pamphlets, written and compiled by Nebraska's Writers' Project between 1937 and 1940. The pamphlets were produced as part of the \\"Folklore Project\\", a WPA Federal Writers‚Äô Project (FWP) supported effort to document the life histories of people from different backgrounds and geographic regions. The WPA supported South Side Community Art Center opened in 1940 providing free art lessons for the community. Geller was a member of the interracial faculty of art instructors that included local black artists such as Charles Davis, Charles White, Bernard Goss, William Carter and local white artists such as Morris Topchevsky, Si Gordon and Max Kahn. Geller became the first president of the American Jewish Arts Club following its formation in Chicago in 1940. Hassidic (1927) In 1942, Geller provided woodcut-illustrations for Jewish dancing master Nathan Vizonsky's book Ten Jewish Folk Dances: A Manual for Teachers and Leaders published by the American-Hebrew Theatrical League in Chicago. The book, possibly the first English-language book to document the dances characteristic of the Jews of Eastern Europe, contains explanations of the purpose of various dances including folkloric information, step-by-step dance descriptions, detailed notes on the costumes to be used and music scores arranged by Max Janowski. Awards Geller's woodcuts won three Library of Congress National Print Exhibition awards. Death and legacy Geller died on 23 February 1949, aged 59. He was survived by his wife Olga Geller, his daughter Esther Silverman and his sister. The Jewish Education Building in Chicago held a memorial exhibit for him shortly after his death. Spertus Institute archive The Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership in Chicago has a collection of papers documenting Geller's career. The archive includes photographs, sketchbooks, original artwork, commissions for stained glass windows, various manuscript material including typescripts of articles, papers relating to the American Artists' Congress, 1937‚Äì1938, and correspondence with art organizations and artists such as Raymond Katz, Beatrice Levy, Archibald Motley, Increase Robinson, and Carl Zigrosser. The papers cover his efforts to establish a Jewish museum in Chicago in 1928, involvement with the WPA Federal Art Project, participation in Artists Equity and the American Federation of Arts, his work teaching art to the Jewish community and his efforts to improve the working conditions and visibility of Jewish artists. The Spertus Institute also holds a number of Geller's oil paintings including Landscape with Figure (1924), Portrait of a Man (1929), Crossroads (ca. 1930), Vase of Flowers (1931), Mexican Village (1935), Portrait of an Artist, Portrait of Ben Shalom, Jerusalem Courtyard, Mitzi, Church Landscape, Portrait of a Woman and two paintings, Tenant Scene (undated) and Park Scene (1946), painted on the same board support in a double-sided format. The Spertus collection also includes a number of Geller's woodcut prints. In March 2011, Susan Weininger, Professor Emerita of Art History at Roosevelt University gave a lecture titled \\"The Dean of Chicago Jewish Artists: Todros Geller & the Chicago Context\\" at North Shore Synagogue Beth El, Highland Park, Illinois, in conjunction with an exhibit of Geller's woodcut prints.

In the upper voice he can change the timbre to a sharp-edged, penetrating tone or to a soft-edged, warm tone, the foundation of his expressive interpretation. In the lower voice his dynamic control is remarkable, changing the volume of accompaniments from loud to soft with innate skill. I was also very impressed with his ability to make complex polyphonic passages sound as if several instruments were playing. Even when playing fast, virtuosic passages, he makes a minimum of string whistles or fingerboard noises. He can, however, deliver fast, soft low note rows at the same time producing an underlying pecking noise on the guitar body, just as Sor wrote, and swelling fast-repeated deep notes as if an accompaniment by timpani. Very impressive - and he plays all the repeats, which in this case is a real benefit. [‚Ä¶] My final words: a splendid set of performances which could almost be regarded as authoritative for the Sor sonatas, captured with startling realism in 5.0 high-resolution sound.

It is about east of Sutherlin, near Calapooya Creek. The population of the area was about 202 in 2000. Nonpareil was the birthplace of novelist H. L. Davis. Nonpareil was named for the nearby Nonpareil quicksilver (mercury) mine, discovered between 1865 and 1870, which at one time was very productive. The mine is no longer in operation, having closed in 1932. \\"Nonpareil\\" is French for \\"unrivaled\\" or \\"unique\\". Nonpareil post office ran from 1882 to 1884. During the height of the mining era, the short-lived town also had a dance hall and a school. The nearby Bonanza Mine also contributed to the town's economy. As of 1990, Nonpareil had a store and no other amenities. Author Ralph Friedman noted that the store's name was misspelled \\"Nonpariel\\". By 2003, the store, which at one time had a gas station, was closed. The area of the mining operations is now owned by Swanson Superior Forest Products of Noti who purchased the land from Weyerhaeuser in 1990. Besides rural residential use, grazing and timber production take place in the Nonpareil area. An abandoned logging railroad grade passes through the town. The roadbed was built beginning in the early 1900s by the Roach Timber Company using mine tailings from the Bonanza mercury mine. Weyerhaeuser bought the railroad in 1949 and lengthened the railroad grade, also using mine tailings. The railroad was decommissioned in 1966, the ties and tracks removed, and portions of the grade, now known as the \\"Red Rock Road\\" were sold. Weyerhaeuser is now working with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to mitigate the effects of the arsenic-laced soil of the roadbed on local residents.

He was a winner of the Shevchenko National Prize in 1972.  Biography  Grave of Mykola Hlushchenko Hlushchenko was born in Novomoskovske, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire. Novomoskovsk is known for the fact that in the 17th century the cite was occupied by several villages of Zaporogian —Åossacks. At the early age Mikola moved to Yuzovka (now Donetsk) where he attended classes in drawing and became fond by artwork of Repin and Vasilkivsky. After escaping a prisoner-of-war camp in Poland during World War I he made his way to Germany where his love for art brought him to the private studio of Hans Baluschek in Berlin. Mykola Hlushchenko was noted by critics who reviewed several of his paintings submitted to the Kasper Art Gallery in Berlin in 1924. A graduate of the Academy of Art in Berlin (1924), from 1925 he worked in Paris where he immediately attracted the attention of French critics. From the Neue Sachlichkeit style of his Berlin period he changed to postimpressionism. Besides numerous French, Italian, Dutch, and (later) Ukrainian landscapes, he also painted flowers, still life, nudes, and portraits (such as of Oleksander Dovzhenko and Volodymyr Vynnychenko, as well as portraits commissioned by the Soviet government of the French writers Henri Barbusse, Romain Rolland, and Victor Margueritte and the painter Paul Signac).'Hlushchenko, Mykola' in Encyclopedia of Ukraine Through his relationship with businessman Andr√© Mirabeau, he allegedly obtained over two hundred drawings of military equipment which he supplied to Soviet intelligence. At the beginning of the 1930s, Hlushchenko belonged to the Association of Independent Ukrainian Artists and helped organize its large exhibition of Ukrainian, French, and Italian paintings at the National Museum in Lviv. In 1936 he moved to the USSR. Working for the Soviet Union secret service, he was among those who warned the Soviet government about the German plan to attack ahead of time. In 1944, he moved to Kyiv, and created a series of paintings of the post-war Kyiv, as well as many landscapes he saw while traveling to France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and other countries.Matoshko, A. ‚ÄòBy Ways of Travels‚Äô in Kyiv Post Jul 23, 2009 online.

Doc thinks that the machine does not work, and sells it to the narrator for 5 dollars. The narrator leaves his shoe in the machine, and discovers the following day that the shoe has become alive. Doc and the narrator catch the shoe and stuff it in a drawer, while Doc returns to the University to get his fellow professors to witness the shoe.

(1811 ‚Äì 9 July 1886) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist, who later became prominent in Wales as a press editor and publisher. Early life Edwards was born in 1811, the year in which the Calvinistic Methodists first assumed the power to ordain their own ministers; and he grew up amid the controversy over Calvin's five great points. Ebenezer Morris, John Elias, etc., were then leading lights in the denomination. In 1835 he became editor of Cronicl yr Oes, perhaps the first Welsh political paper. This he conducted for four years, writing most of it himself. The leaders in the Chronicle for 1836 on the \\"House of Lords\\", \\"The Ballot\\" and \\"Church Rates\\" were strongly radical, and they brought on young Edwards the charge of socialism and sympathy with Tom Paine. Editing and publishing From 1839 to 1874 Edwards was secretary of the Calvinistic Methodist Association. In January 1845 there appeared the first number of the Traethodydd, of which he was co-editor with his namesake Lewis Edwards till 1855, and after that with another till his death in 1886. He was editor of the Drysorfa (a magazine founded in 1779 by Thomas Charles of Bala from 1846 to 1886. Besides this he published two volumes of the Preacher, a hymn book called the Welsh Psalmist, Methodist Diary, James Hughes's Expositor, with additional notes, and three volumes of sermons by Henru Rees of Liverpool. Edwards was the first to publish a serial story in Welsh; of these he wrote three. Influence Although his own literary efforts are largely forgotten today, he was a key early influence on the novelist Daniel Owen, serving as a kind of mentor to the fatherless Owen and encouraging him to take up writing when illness had forced Owen to give up preaching.

It is also known as the Kamelfelsen (\\"Camel Rocks\\") due to its unusually shaped sandstone rock formation.  Location and area  The K√∂nigstein lies in the northern Harz Foreland, northwest of Westerhausen (near Quedlinburg) on the road towards B√∂rnecke. Its neighbouring hill to the northwest is the 178 m high J√§tchenberg. The federal road B 6n runs by to the north. The K√∂nigstein is a ridge running from northwest to southeast. Its northeastern flank is relatively steep, but its southwestern slopes fall away much more gently. It is mostly covered in deciduous forest.Bundesamt f√ºr Kartographie und Geod√§sie, Landesamt f√ºr Vermessung und Geoinformation Sachsen-Anhalt: Digitale Topographische Karte 1:50 000, Sachsen-Anhalt Viewer , accessed on 29 November 2010 (German) The vineyard on the southern slopes of the K√∂nigstein belongs to the Saale-Unstrut wine- growing area. The crest of the ridge is dominated by the striking Kamelfelsen rocks, whose name derives from their shape: seen from the south or north they are supposed to resemble two camels lying down.  The Kamelfelsen  The Kamelfelsen consist of hardened sandstone, which also has very soft and crumbly sections. This rock formation, like the well-known Teufelsmauer, was created as a result of the formation of the fault-block mountains of the Harz and the earth movements in the northern Harz Foreland resulting from it. Like the nearby Teufelsmauer, the K√∂nigstein is a \\"rib\\" of harder rock (Schichtrippe) from the Lower Cretaceous. The K√∂nigstein was first placed under protection as a geological feature in 1932 and has been registered as a natural monument since 1997. There are several climbing routes on the Kamelfelsen up to climbing grade VIIIb (Saxon grading).  History  The K√∂nigstein was probably used during the Stone Age as a cult site, and Germanic summer solstice celebrations may have taken place here,. The \\"sun discs\\" (Sonnenr√§der) on the rocks - circular shapes cut into the rock, about 1 metre or more in diameter which are distributed around the lower part of the rocks on their northern side - are artifacts resulting from the production of millstones.Reinboth, Fritz (2005).

Launched by a group called The Zippies from San Francisco's 181 Club on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down for at least a week.Wikileaks Infowar not the first online protest action  Medialternatives It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) known as the Email bomb in order to overload servers as a form of online protest and Internet activism. It was the first such use of the Internet and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the 1995 Italian NetStrike. Campaign against the CJB Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, the definition of music played at a rave was given as: \\"music includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\\". Sections 63, 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when \\"ten or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave\\". Section 65 allowed any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; \\"non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (¬£1000)\\". The Zippies sought to jam the mailboxes of UK politicians associated with the Bill in order to bring their attention to the issue of natural justice involving basic rights and freedoms. In effect, the collective action was saying: \\"If you take away our freedom, we have the power to take away something you take for granted, and to do this in a way which deploys the Internet as a weapon\\". Several hackers not directly associated with the group launched all-out penetration testing and load testing operations against several UK government websites, resulting in a tit-for-tat battle, as the Zippies mailbox on morph.com went down, along with the entire server of Morph, a well-known Bay Area BBS. Media Coverage The event was broadcast on Radio Free Berkeley. The protest action occurred during the manhunt for Kevin Mitnick and was thus partly an underground event. The media also refused to entertain the implications of electronic civil disobedience, with public attention focused on the problem of illegal raves and black-hat hackers, prompting scare stories about \\"evil hackers\\" and \\"young hoodlums\\" penetrating the British defences while the zippies were written off as nothing more than electrohippies. Criticism Some criticism of the Intervasion was expressed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation who complained about the \\"lack of a cutoff date\\". Other criticism on the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL) BBS centered on the use of militant language. The online protest action also suffered from conflict between its stated aims: \\"To clog the servers of the UK government\\", and its call to send email messages to UK politicians. Thus jamming mailboxes with email and large file attachments defeated the purpose of the exercise which was essentially an early form of hacktivism. The nature of the collective action was also not articulated well enough. For instance, the digital be-in which occurred during the launch of Timothy Leary's Chaos and Cyberculture, in which Leary was \\"kidnapped\\" without the consent of his publisher, and \\"forced\\" to DDoS the UK government, was simply a protest message, sent repeatedly to mail-boxes around the world.

He was a director of the failed Hanover Group which owned a number of finance companies including Hanover Finance, United Finance, Nationwide Finance and FAI Finance. The Hanover Group also had interests in property and was responsible for developing Matarangi Beach Estates and golf course, and acquired completed lots at the Jacks Point property sub-division in Queenstown. The Group also had property and finance interests in Australia. With Eric Watson he bought 30 per cent of Elders Finance in 1999 and in December that year bought it outright. Elders Finance became the core of what would become Hanover Finance. Two years on, their other finance and investment assets (Nationwide Finance, Leasing Solutions, Elders Home Loans and Hanover Securities) were rolled in to create Hanover Group with reported assets of $650m. The flow on effects of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and nervous reaction of investors lowered overall confidence in the market and saw over 50 finance companies in New Zealand fail by 2010. Hanover applied to the trustee for a repayment freeze or moratorium rather than a receivership. After the repayment freeze Hanover prepared a debt repayment plan, offering to repay investors over a 5-year period. As part of the plan, Hotchin and Watson pledged $96 million of assets. These assets fell in value as property prices declined. Hotchin arranged for Allied Farmers to take over the failing business, but the losses overwhelmed the new owner and the business was put into liquidation in 2010. In December 2011 the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) announced that it proposed to file civil proceedings against Hotchin and the other directors and promoters of Hanover. Early life and business Mark Hotchin was born in Auckland, and attended Roman Catholic schools, St Joseph's Primary School in Onehunga, Marcellin College and St Paul's College. His father owned a joinery factory, and was also involved with property development. When Mark Hotchin left school he worked in his father's factory. His first business was a sports goods store, which got into financial trouble and was rescued by his father. Hotchin first bought and subdivided a house for profit in 1982 when he was 23 years old. He then did an increasing number of such subdivisions. In the 1990s, he bought Regency Court in the Auckland suburb of Saint Heliers for $6 million, selling it later for $10 million. He bought the successful taxi company Corporate Cabs, expanded it and sold it in 1999 to former Skellerup Group boss Murray Bolton. He bought Matarangi Beach Estates in 1995. Finance companies Hotchin's property development work depended on borrowing from finance companies and banks. Hotchin saw an opportunity to lend to developers like himself and bridge the gap between bank funding and equity funding. This coincided with a boom in the housing and construction market in NZ throughout the early part of the 2000s. =Hanover group= Hotchin and business partner Eric Watson bought Elders Finance in 1999. Elders, and a number of other finance companies, were brought together to create Hanover Group. With $650 million in assets, this was New Zealand's third largest finance company at the time. In 2007, Forbes listed Hotchin and Watson as the 33rd and 34th richest people in New Zealand and Australia. Hotchin's interests ranged outside the traditional finance company model. In 2003 Hotchin through the Hanover Group bought a 10% stake in Tower, a large fund management and insurance business. Hanover wanted a better deal for investors and forced Tower and owners GPG to review the capital raising and underwrite deal they had agreed. In 2007 Hanover Group made an after tax profit of $105m. Controversially Hanover Finance paid NZ$45.5 million in dividends to Hotchin and Watson in the year ending 30 June 2008. Much of these dividends were then reinvested back into the company to reduce related party transactions, which at the time were around 14% of the loan book. As a result of the continuing worsening global financial crisis in July 2008 Hanover Finance and United Finance froze repayments of NZ$554 million owed to 36,500 investors. After a vote over 85% of investors agreed to a debt repayment plan for the return of their capital over a 5-year time scale, predicated on the recovery of the New Zealand property market. Hotchin and Watson pledged a property, benefits and cash package worth up to $96m to investors as part of the deal. By November 2009 accountancy firm PwC estimated that the package had fallen in value to between $36 million and $56 million, due to a fall in property prices. Over the first year of the debt repayment plan, six cents in the dollar was repaid to investors, however the property market had continued to worsen and it appeared the company was heading for receivership. In 2009 Hanover was approached by Allied Farmers to buy the assets of Hanover Finance and United Finance, effectively held in limbo by the repayment plan. In December 2009 Hanover Group debenture holders, note holders and bond holders were given another opportunity to vote for receivership or for the new plan with Allied. 75% voted in favour of swapping their debentures, notes and bonds for shares in Allied Farmers Limited. This transaction resulted in Allied Farmers assuming the net asset position of the Hanover Group finance companies. Allied Farmers put their finance company Allied Nationwide into receivership on 20 August 2010 and as at March 2011 shares in were worth only a fraction of what they were traded for. In late December 2011, the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) announced that it proposed to file civil proceedings against the directors and promoters of Hanover Finance Limited and other companies relating to statements made in the December 2007 prospectuses and subsequent advertisements. As a result of the FMA's announcement former Hanover Finance's chairman Greg Muir issued a media statement saying that \\"the FMA investigators were given a substantial amount of evidence demonstrating that the directors conducted themselves responsibly, with appropriate rigour, and made judgments they believed were in the best interests of the company and its investors on the information available to them at the time.\\" In December 2012, the remaining property assets of Hanover and United Finance (with a book value of $13.5 million) were transferred from Allied Farmers to Crown Asset Management, the entity set up to hold assets from failed finance companies backed by the Government's deposit guarantee. Dirty Politics controversy Emails provided by Rawshark to Fairfax Media appear to show that Hotchin secretly paid right wing bloggers Cameron Slater and Cathy Odgers to write attack posts undermining the Serious Fraud Office, its chief executive Adam Feely, and the Financial Markets Authority, while they were investigating the collapse of Hanover Finance in 2011.Judith Collins inquiry details due Monday, Stuff 31 August 2014.

Personal life Amongst the most controversial of his New Zealand assets is a still unfinished house on the upmarket Paritai Drive, in the Auckland suburb of Orakei. This house has been the target of much of the public's ill-feeling towards Hotchin. In 2009, pizza company Hell Pizza set up a large billboard on a trailer outside the house to advertise pizza based on the seven deadly sins. In 2011 Hotchin decided to sue the country's biggest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, for aggravated and punitive damages. Hotchin's New Zealand assets were frozen by the High Court, following an application by the Securities Commission. But a decision by the Court to have the order overturned has been ruled on but not made public.

Michale Fee is faculty in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an Investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. His laboratory studies how songbirds generate and learn complex vocal sequences. Biography Michale Fee received a B.E. with honors in Engineering Physics from the School of Engineering at the University of Michigan (1985). He received a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford University (1992), where he conducted his thesis work in the laboratory of Steven Chu. From September 1992‚ÄìJune 1996 he was a postdoctoral fellow at Bell Laboratories in the Biological Computation Research Department, where he worked in the laboratory of David Kleinfeld on the cortical circuitry in the vibrissa system of the rat underlying the sense of touch. In 1996 Michale Fee joined the Biological Computation Research Department at Bell Labs as a permanent researcher (Member of Technical Staff), at which time he began working on the mechanisms of vocal sequence generation in the songbird. In 2003, he joined the faculty of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT as Associate Professor of Neuroscience with tenure. At the same time he was appointed as an investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. He has delivered lectures in numerous international conferences and research departments. He was promoted to Full Professor at MIT in 2010. Research Michale Fee's research aims to understand how neural circuits in the brain subserve the generation and learning or complex motor sequences. His lab primarily uses the zebra finch as a model system. Zebra finches, like other songbirds, learn their songs from their father and are commonly used to study the neural mechanisms of motor learning. He and his colleagues discovered that the timing of song is encoded in the zebra finch using a very sparse code, with neurons in the high vocal center of the avian cortex generally firing action potentials only once per song. He and his colleagues also found that a brain circuit necessary for song learning also generates the variability in juvenile song. In particular, this circuit is required for the early unstructured vocalizations that resemble babbling in humans.

In October, Syed and Amira Masood's child Yasmin arrives and Mark Garland was introduced as a new love interest for Kat Moon. Poppy Meadow Poppy Meadow, played by Rachel Bright, was introduced by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood on 11 January 2011 as the best friend of established character Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) in scenes filling in for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline. Poppy returned to the series in June 2011 as a supporting character and comedy element, in a move that was generally welcomed by the tabloid press; her storylines focused on her friendship with Jodie and their intertwined love lives. Both Jodie and Poppy left the series on 14 November 2011, but the possibility was left open for Poppy to return in the future. In June 2012 Bright reprised her role as Poppy, quickly moving into Walford and resuming her employment at the local beauty salon. Bright filmed her final scenes before Christmas 2013 and Poppy departed in the last week of January 2014. Rob Grayson Rob Grayson, played by Jody Latham, is a pimp who exploits Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) for financial gain. His first appearance was on 22 February 2011, and he appeared until a special Comic Relief episode on 18 March 2011. He made a short return from 19 August 2011 until 26 August 2011. He first appears when he witnesses Whitney attempting to pickpocket a man but ending up with cuts on her face. Rob rescues her from the situation, and buys her a meal. He gives her his number so she can contact him any time she needs to get away from Walford, before taking her home. They stay in contact and Rob is seen showing a friend a photo of Whitney. When Whitney either rejects or is rejected by all her friends and family, she contacts Rob and he takes her to stay with him. After Whitney has been missing for several days, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) tries to phone her, leaving several messages. When she finally gets a voicemail back, it is from Rob saying if she calls again, there will be trouble. Lauren tracks Whitney down to Dartford, but Whitney insists she is fine with Rob, and that they are in love. Rob meets Lauren at their bedsit and invites her out with them, but Lauren leaves. Rob then leaves Whitney alone with Chris (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Rob is using Whitney to pay off his debts. Rob meets Lauren in a caf√© and again invites her out and calls her beautiful. He then threatens her, saying he does not want to see her again. When Rob returns to the bedsit, Whitney is there with Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks), who says she is taking Whitney home. Whitney refuses to go and Rob ejects Janine from the building. Rob then tells Whitney they are going out immediately, and drags her to the car as she refuses to go. Lauren and Janine watch as Rob drives away with Whitney. Rob takes Whitney to a house where she meets Chloe (Georgia Henshaw), another girl being exploited. Whitney realises she is there to have sex with men, so asks Rob if she can leave. Rob says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He grabs her and locks her in a room. She is unable to open the windows so when she hears people outside the door, she smashes a window, jumps to the ground and runs away with Rob calling after her. She then stops a car and asks for help. She later returns to Walford after being arrested for shoplifting. Her half brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) learns of what happened and wants to find Rob but Whitney says he has moved. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. Whitney goes to meet Lee and is shocked to see Rob instead. She is taken in by his charm until she texts Lee not to come, and then sees the message on Rob's phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves Rob a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall over the edge of the pier. A body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob's. =Development= In January 2011, it was announced that Whitney would be part of the sexual exploitation storyline. She is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for Rob, who then exploits her. EastEnders worked alongside charity Comic Relief on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during Red Nose Day 2011 on 18 March 2011, in a special 10-minute episode. Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: \\"It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with EastEnders will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the EastEnders script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation.\\" Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added \\"We have worked over many years with EastEnders in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it.\\" An EastEnders insider spoke of the storyline leading up to Rob's arrival: \\"Janine's a terrible influence and is soon dragging Whitney into all sorts of shady schemes. Given that Janine used to be a prostitute, it makes sense that she's part of Whitney's journey. Whitney has no idea what she's letting herself in for. Janine is only part of the problem though. It's when she meets Rob‚Äîa deeply unscrupulous man‚Äîthat her life starts to fall apart in a terrifying way.\\" Rob has been called \\"evil\\" by The People and by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood, a \\"nasty piece of work\\" by Orange, and \\"sinister\\" by Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy. McGarty hoped the storyline would raise awareness of the issue for young people, and explained that the storyline would be a continuing one, as \\"Whitney will live in fear that Rob and his gang are going to come after her when she escapes. That's what these people do. They don't just leave you to get on with your life. In their mind they own you.\\" She also added that she hopes that the storyline will lead to better conviction rates as she said that they aren't 'good enough'. Latham revealed after his stint that he hoped to return, saying, \\"I always say it's better to play the bad guy‚Äîeveryone remembers the bad guy. They get the best endings. I had an absolutely great time on EastEnders. It was a breath of fresh air. [...] Judging from the way it was left, the door is wide open, so you never know. I would love to come back and cause some trouble.\\" On 1 May 2011 it was reported by the Daily Star that Latham would return to EastEnders in a couple of weeks time to film the conclusion to the storyline. A source said, \\"Whitney will not be going back on the streets but the writers felt the storyline needed to be tied up so Jody is coming back for a couple of episodes. Whitney is currently having to come to terms with everything that she did while under Rob's spell and she's not coping very well. She's trying to move on but, with everyone knowing that she worked as a prostitute, she's finding it all very difficult. The writers decided it would be good for her to come face to face with Rob again once she's strong enough to do so. They've written the conclusion to her storyline and Jody will be back to film the dramatic ending in a couple of weeks time. Rob is set to finally get his .\\" An EastEnders spokesperson confirmed this. Kirkwood said that Rob would return when Whitney is at her most vulnerable, following the reveal of her brother Ryan's affair with her best friend Lauren. Scenes were filmed in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, for Rob's return, after Ryan tracks Rob down and finds Whitney with him. Ryan and Rob had a massive showdown on the pier, and Ryan murdereed Rob as revenge for forcing Whitney into prostitution. Ryan then went on the run from the police, not wanting to get caught for murdering Rob. Latham had received criticism from viewers who struggled to understand his Burnley accent. He said, \\"I'm sorry people are having difficulty with my accent. I'm sure the great fans of EastEnders will get used to it!\\" The storyline reportedly received criticism from fans. The BBC issued a statement, saying: Speaking about how members of the public reacted to the storyline, Latham told OK!, \\"Considering Rob makes Phil Mitchell look like a field mouse, I've got to be quite grateful. I've not had a tin of baked beans chucked at me in Asda by some nice old lady. It's just a bit of banter off the public, which I relish. I've not had anyone threaten to beat me up yet, which is a plus point!\\" Shenice Quinn Shenice Quinn, played by nine-year-old (at the time of casting) Lily Harvey, is the daughter of Martina Quinn (Tamara Wall), who is an old friend of Kat Moon's (Jessie Wallace) from Spain. Martina reported Kat and her husband Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) to the police in Spain, leading to some animosity between Kat and Martina. Martina and Shenice arrive at The Queen Victoria, and Kat immediately throws water over Martina. However, she reveals that her bar was smashed up by the police and she was worried that she would lose Shenice if she did not tell the truth. Alfie bonds with Shenice, and Martina tells Kat that she has lost her bar and has nothing left, so Kat allows them to stay with her and Alfie at the Vic. After a night out with Kat, Martina spends the day in bed. Kat later finds Shenice wearing her clothes and makeup. Kat shouts at Shenice to take the clothes off, and Shenice flinches thinking Kat is going to hit her. The next day, Shenice is caught trying to steal cigarettes from the local shop, which Kat chastises a drunken Martina for. Martina calls her daughter useless before going to bed, and Shenice tells Kat and Alfie that Martina says things she does not mean when she is drunk. The next day, Martina tells Kat that she is back with her boyfriend and she will get some money so she and Shenice can move out. Kat and Alfie organise a birthday party for Shenice as Martina has forgotten and Shenice takes a disliking to Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) as they are wearing the same outfit. Shenice has to leave halfway through the party as Martina finds a place to live, and they move out, leaving Kat and Alfie distraught. Kat and Alfie holiday in Spain and return with Shenice. Shenice and Tiffany become friends again but Shenice grows bored as Kat cannot take her and Tiffany out anywhere because of Kat's baby Tommy. Shenice bonds with Kat's relative Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) after helping her plant some window boxes. When Shenice is due to go back to Spain, she begs to stay in Walford and Alfie agrees. Shenice is then enrolled at Walford Primary School. Martina allows Shenice to spend Christmas with Kat and Alfie. When Jean is questioned for benefit fraud, it sparks off another bipolar episode. This results in Jean believing that Shenice is an angel sent from her daughter Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner). Jean tries to take Shenice ice skating whilst dressed in pyjamas. Shenice manages to escape and runs back to The Queen Victoria to alert Kat and Alfie. Jean's mental health improves, and though Shenice is wary of her for a time, she allows Jean to become her honorary grandma. Shenice goes to visit Martina in Spain, and on 7 September 2012 Kat reveals to Alfie that she is not coming back. =Development= Harvey is the real-life sister of Lacey Turner who played Stacey Slater, and first appears on screen on 28 February 2011. Producers were unaware that Harvey and Turner were related until after the casting was made. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood explained: \\"I sat down and watched a tape of a very talented young girl and it was only after we decided to cast [Harvey] that I was told [she] was [Turner]'s sister. [Harvey] got the role entirely on her own merits.\\" In April 2011 it was announced that Harvey would be reprising the role. She made her return on 1 August 2011. In July 2012, Harvey was nominated in the Best Young Actor category at the 2012 Inside Soap awards for her portrayal of Shenice. Ashley Chubb Ashley Chubb, played by Colin Mace, is the father of established character Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). He is mentioned in the episode broadcast on 14 March 2011 when Fatboy says his parents have split up because Ashley has lost his job. Ashley arrives in Walford two weeks later, needing a place to stay. Fatboy invites him to stay with his friend, Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu), and her grandmother, Grace Olubunmi (Ellen Thomas), but has to sneak him in so Grace does not find out. Ashley then rents a room at the local bed and breakfast, run by Kim Fox (Tameka Empson). He asks Fatboy for money, saying he has a job interview out of town but spends it on alcohol, telling Kim that he has done a one-off job for a friend. Fatboy discovers that Ashley is simply drinking away the money he lent him, and Kim leaves, telling Ashley not to stress about the rent. Fatboy tells Ashley that he is in love with Mercy but she has a boyfriend, so to help Fatboy, he reports Mercy to the border agency for having an expired visa, which Fatboy told him about. Ashley then leaves Walford and two days later the UK Border Agency talk to Mercy and deport her. Before she leaves, Fatboy proposes. It was announced on 23 January 2011 that EastEnders producers were planning to expand Fatboy's family due to his popularity, and were in the process of casting his father. The part was cast to Mace, who filmed five episodes. Ashley is said to be a wheeler-dealer like his son. Ashley's arrival is reported to be due to difficulties in his personal life. An EastEnders insider is reported to have said \\"Fatboy has been a real hit with viewers and the bosses have decided that it's now time to bring in his dad so people can see what Fatboy is really all about.\\" Ashley has been described as \\"dishevelled\\". Although Ashley only makes a guest appearance, Norwood expressed a hope for the character to return so the relationship between father and son could be further explored, adding, \\"There's great chemistry between Ashley and Fatboy\\". Ashley appeared in episodes between 31 March and 21 April 2011. He returned on 31 May 2011. Lydia Simmonds Lydia Simmonds, initially played by Margaret Tyzack and then by Heather Chasen, is the maternal grandmother of Ricky (Sid Owen) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). She made her first appearance on 5 April 2011. She left the series on 13 June 2011. Described as twisted, manipulative, damaged and \\"[a] lady of class and dignity\\", Lydia's backstory states that she loved her daughter June but hated the man June married, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), so she grew old alone and lived a life of solitude. Lydia and Janine were estranged for years and Janine is shocked to have her grandmother back in her life. The character and casting were announced on 15 February 2011, and of her casting, Tyzack said \\"I am delighted to be joining a great British tradition and a fine company of actors\\", and Executive Producer Bryan Kirkwood said: \\"What a coup to have Margaret Tyzack starring in EastEnders. She is an actress of incredible class and talent. Lydia has endless possibilities as a character, and I can't wait to see Janine meet her match.\\" Cora Cross Cora Cross, played by Ann Mitchell, is the mother of Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks). Cora initially appeared from 11 to 15 April 2011, and returned as a regular character on 28 July. Cora and her casting were announced on 21 March 2011, when she was described as having \\"a brash, outspoken attitude and does not care who she offends. She also quickly puts Tanya under scrutiny, believing that success has turned her into a snob\\". It was said that she secretly wants to heal the rift between Tanya and Rainie. She has also been described as a \\"bolshie battleaxe\\". Mitchell said of her casting \\"As a lifelong fan of EastEnders, I am thrilled to join the cast. I am a great fan of June Brown's [who plays Dot Branning] and am looking forward to sharing some scenes with her.\\" Cora initially appeared from 11 to 15 April 2011. On 31 May 2011, it was confirmed that Cora would be returning to EastEnders as a regular character. Kirkwood said, \\"We all love Cora here‚Äîactress Ann Mitchell could be one of the Walford greats. She'll be returning late in the summer and is here to stay.\\" Kirkwood added that he was keen to establish the Cross women. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said, \\"During her brief stay on Albert Square, Cora quickly became known for her brash attitude and outspoken ways.\\" Kate White of Inside Soap praised the character saying \\"All hail the new queen of soap ‚Äì fabulous Cora is everything the discerning viewer could ever want.\\" White added she could watch Mitchell acting \\"her socks off\\" all day long.

He first appears when he is seen sitting at the bar of The Queen Victoria and Jane asks him to join her pub quiz team. Afterwards, Martin asks Jane to invite him next time. Martin passes his number to Jane via her brother Christian Clarke (John Partridge), asking her to call him. On Jane's 40th birthday, he turns up at the pub and goes over to Jane. They both lie about their lives and jobs, but as they are about to kiss, Martin says he cannot keep lying as he likes Jane too much, and says he's divorced with a child and lives in a pokey flat. Jane also tells the truth and stops Martin leaving, saying her house is not pokey and they can go there. They kiss as they enter the house but are surprised by Jane's husband Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and his son Bobby Beale (Alex Francis), throwing her a surprise dinner. The next day, Jane tries to end their brief relationship, but he kisses her, which Ian sees through the window, though Jane dumps him. The Daily Star reported that Jane will have a one-night stand with Martin and viewers would be left wondering if she would confess to her husband, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). However, an EastEnders source told Digital Spy, \\"It doesn't go as far as a one-night stand, but Jane is flattered by the attention, they exchange phone numbers, there's some flirting and a couple of kisses.\\" Martin has been described as a \\"hunk\\".

Dot later finds out that Marta is working nights as well, and Marta explains that her husband drinks and lost his job. She begs Dot not to tell the agency, and Dot allows her to continue working for her. When Marta returns a week later, Dot says she does not need any help and makes Marta look after her husband, Jim Branning (John Bardon), but Marta protests that that is not her job. The following day, Marta arrives late, annoying Dot. While Dot is looking through her purse, she finds a ¬£10 note which she drops on the floor. She leaves the room, but comes back having lost the cash and accuses Marta of stealing it, thinking she put it on the table; Marta is fired by Dot. Dot later finds the money on the floor and regrets sacking Marta. After Marta was seen smoking an electronic cigarette, it was reported that some viewers who smoked had switched from real cigarettes. The electronic cigarettes were supplied by E-Lites, and Adrian Everett, one of the company's founders and directors, said: \\"[W]e were delighted to be asked to supply E-Lites to the makers of EastEnders as part of a new storyline. The fact that electronic cigarettes were featured in an everyday scene is a fantastic example of how our products are being accepted by the wider population. More people are becoming aware of E-Lites every day and this is yet another big step forward.\\" Jimmie Broome Jimmie Broome, played by Samuel James, is Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden) lawyer.

In November, he is hired again to help Phil's cousin Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) regain custody of her daughter Amy Mitchell from the father, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). He suggests that Roxy dig up as much dirt on Jack and his family as she can. Roxy does this, deciding to use Jack's brother Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) criminal past against Jack, as Derek is staying with him, but this fails and a court grants custody to Jack. Phil then sacks Jimmie, though his relative Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) asks Jimmie for advice on his pregnant granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), whose baby could be taken into care once it is born. Jimmie advises Billy to apply for a Special Guardianship Order, which would grant him legal responsibility for the child. He returns on 9 February 2012 at Amy's custody case, after which Roxy gains custody of her. On 23 October 2012, apparently re-hired, Jimmie speaks to Phil about gaining custody of Lola's baby Lexi Pearce, as she has been taken into care and is actually Phil's granddaughter. Jimmie says that Phil would have a better chance of gaining custody if he is in a stable relationship. Jimmie later tells Phil that his son Ben's (Joshua Pascoe) murder charge has been dropped and he will be tried for manslaughter, and that Ben has agreed to a visit from Phil. When Jimmie advises Phil that he needs to find a way to prove to the court that he has a good support network for Lexi, Phil secretly orders Jimmie to put Sharon's name down on the application as his fianc√©e. Jimmie helps Phil to become Lexi's foster father, while Lola is allowed three access visits a week.

When it was reported that Shameem would suspect that Yusef and Zainab are having an affair, a source said, \\"The whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair. Everyone struggles to come to terms with what they have just heard.

It's one hell of a fall-out.\\" Tyler Moon Tyler Moon, played by Tony Discipline, is the son of Eddie Moon (David Essex), half brother of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), brother of Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) and cousin of Alfie Moon (Shane Richie).

He can be quick to snap at certain people sometimes if they get on the wrong side of him, but he's a lovely guy. He's also very flirty when it comes to the women! He's a bit of a chap to say the least! It's not because he's seedy or he's horrible or anything like that‚Äîhe genuinely enjoys chatting to women and chasing them. Even if they turned him down, it's all part of the chase and that's fun for Tyler. You can expect a lot of flirting, a lot of girls and maybe some arguments. We shall see!\\" Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy added that the character has a lot of energy. Norman Simmonds Norman Simmonds, played by George Layton, is the estranged son of Lydia Simmonds (Heather Chasen).

Jean agrees to go to a skiffle event with him. However, she misunderstands, as he is actually giving her both tickets and not going with her. Jean's relative Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) confronts Norman for playing games but he insists he was never planning to go with Jean. This causes an argument between Kat, Pat and Janine, and Janine tells Norman that Pat used to be a prostitute. Norman tells Janine he is ashamed to be related to her. Jean soon becomes obsessed with Norman, constantly sending him text messages. She invites him to dinner, but he says no, saying he would not want to make a habit of it. Jean then mistakenly thinks Norman wants to live with her. He is shocked at this, and asks Kat's husband Alfie (Shane Richie) for help. Alfie makes things worse though, so Norman is forced to tell Jean that they should just be friends, as he feels she is too good for him. When Pat discovers that her son, Simon Wicks, who lives in New Zealand, is going to lose his home, she fails to get a loan because of her age. Norman offers to help and organises a loan for her.

However, the next day Norman tells Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) that he regularly earns commission for organising loans for people. Patrick then warns Pat about this, and once Pat finds out that the terms of the loan mean if she misses a payment she could lose her house, she rejects Norman, tells him to leave and says she never wants to see him again. A few months later, Norman returns to Walford, saying he has raised enough money to help Pat with the loan. However, Pat has died, so he goes to the Butchers' house to pay his respects.

I have watched the show all my life and I never thought that one day I could be in Albert Square. It feels strange to be walking round Walford with people I have grown up watching‚ÄîI still have to pinch myself.\\". EastEnders is Harold's first acting job and she was given the role following her first audition, which shocked her. Harold told Daybreak, \\"It was my first audition that I'd ever had, so I was really nervous and I was thinking, 'I'm never going to get it ‚Äì I'm just going to have fun while I'm there'. I was just shocked to even get the casting for it, so I was over the moon when I actually got the part.\\" Harold previously starred in Jamie Oliver's Channel 4 reality show Jamie's Dream School and got into an acting school because of the show.

When Whitney texts Lee that she wants to meet again, it is revealed that Lee is a friend of Rob, who previously forced Whitney into prostitution, and Lee hands his phone to Rob. After Rob is killed in a fight with Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott), Lee visits Whitney and tells her not to get his name involved as police have visited him. She tells him to leave, deliberately causing a scene, and he leaves. Speaking of his time on EastEnders, Hunt said in an interview, \\"It was great. It was my first job out of drama school, as I only finished a few weeks before. I had to jump straight into it, but everyone was so nice. The cast and crew really are just like one big family. Everything moves so fast. There are four cameras on you at any one time, so there is no room for error.\\" Hunt also hoped for a return for Lee, saying, \\"Well, my character doesn't die, so there's always hope!\\" Rose Cotton Rose Cotton, played by Polly Perkins, is the estranged half sister of Dot Branning (June Brown).

Dot kicks Rose out but she later returns, saying she does not want to lose her sister again. Rose moves in and Dot urges her to earn money. When Dot gossips to her about Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and her family, Rose uses this information to make Jean think she is psychic, and Jean pays her for her services. She then gets a trial working for Doctor Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) as his receptionist. She gets the job and appears to enjoy it, although her constant pining over Yusef appears to irritate him somewhat.

Shirley walks out but when she returns, it is too late for them to go in but Andrew, who is working on the door, lets them in anyway. Heather tells Andrew that she and Shirley are lesbians as the event is for couples, but he thinks Heather is lying, and she admits it. When Andrew talks to Shirley, she says Heather is not interested and Heather thinks Andrew is more interested in Shirley. Eventually, Shirley tells Heather that Andrew likes her, but did not tell her in case it was purely for a bet. This upsets Heather, who tells Andrew the bet is off. Heather soon realises she was wrong and meets Andrew in the restaurant of the hotel where she is staying. Heather's friend Dot Branning (June Brown) arrives with her half sister Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins) and it is revealed that Andrew is Rose's son and they do not get on.

Andrew then returns to Southend. Andrew returns to Walford in December and promises to stay for Christmas, much to Rose and Dot's delight. He meets Heather again, and vows to her that he will make up for his past mistakes with her. Heather initially rejects him, but then they share a kiss. He later asks to spend Christmas with her, and she agrees. Andrew starts working as a doorman at the R&R; nightclub. Heather is upset when he chooses to work instead of spending the night with her. Andrew leaves Heather several messages, explaining he was scared and he will wait in the caf√© until she arrives. However, he is asked to leave because he is taking up a seat and he refuses. In his anger, he pushes a table over, which Heather witnesses. She forgives him, and the couple soon admit their love for each other.

At Heather's hen night, Andrew's temper emerges again when he almost hits Shirley and it is revealed that Andrew went to prison for assaulting Rose's husband. Heather stays with Andrew as he explains that Rose's husband regularly abused her. Sick of the interference in their wedding, Andrew suggests to Heather that they elope. Heather is unsure, so he gives her two train tickets and tells her to meet him at The Queen Victoria public house by 6 pm if she wants to elope with him. Heather does not arrive, so Andrew gets drunk, leaves the pub and considers leaving Walford. He is persuaded to stay by a homeless man, Gerry (Michael Elliott), and returns to Heather's flat, only to find that Heather has been murdered. Andrew is arrested by the police, as he doesn't have an alibi for where he was when Heather died and they suspect him as he cannot prove that a tramp stole Heather's money from him. However, he is eventually released without charge. Shirley confronts Andrew and publicly accuses him of murdering Heather. However, when it is suggested that Andrew should leave Walford, he declares that he plans to stay. Dot doubts Andrew's innocence but when Andrew opens up to Dot about his feelings for Heather, Dot changes her mind. This leads to Shirley banning Andrew and Dot from Heather's funeral. However, Shirley later finds the train tickets that Andrew gave Heather the night she died and realises he is innocent. She later admits that she wanted him to be the killer as she was jealous and the pair agree to unite to find Heather's real killer. Dot and Rose eventually leave Walford, leaving Andrew with no family there. Heather's killer is eventually revealed to be Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) after he confesses to the police. When Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) is released on bail charged with perverting the course of justice for protecting Ben, Andrew accuses Shirley of protecting them as they were living with her. When he sees Jay, he attacks him in The Queen Victoria by pushing him onto a table. The next day, Andrew realises that he will never be able to move on as long as he stays in Walford because of the memories and decides to leave. =Creation and development= In November 2011, executive producer Bryan Kirkwood told Inside Soap that Andrew would be returning to EastEnders to woo Heather. In March 2012, Grover said that Andrew will be staying with EastEnders, despite Heather's departure. Speaking to Inside Soap, Grover said: \\"EastEnders have asked me to stay on as a more regular character, so I'm hoping to be involved for another year or so.\\" He added that it was a lovely compliment as Andrew was originally intended for four episodes only and that it was a shock to hear that Fergison would be leaving the show. Grover revealed in April 2012 that he initially turned down the role of Andrew up to five times, before being persuaded to accept the role. Grover said he was scared of being branded a \\"silly fat couple\\" as both Andrew and Heather are overweight. He said he spoke to Steve McFadden, who is a friend of his and he told Grover that he can play the role how he wants so eventually accepted it. Speaking about his introduction, Grover added that Heather and Andrew were \\"hitting it off\\" and it is like he and Fergison have been working together for years. Grover also added that when he is filming, he \\"makes it sound authentic\\". Fergison commented on Heather feelings when Andrew proposes to her, saying that Heather \\"couldn't be happier\\". Fergison told All About Soap: \\"He tells Heather he has to go and fix Dot's leaky tap, but she discovers he's lying. Her mind goes into overdrive and she's convinced he must be involved in dodgy dealings. She's been let down so many times before, and her initial reaction is to fly off the handle. In the end, he proposes with a plastic washer from Dot's tap,\\" she continued. \\"Heather's thrilled, though, and couldn't be happier ‚Äì the ring could have been from a lucky-dip bag and she'd have still said yes. She can't believe her luck.\\" Fergison also added that Heather and Andrew are likely to have a budget wedding if it goes ahead. She continued: \\"It will all be done on a shoestring, but they'll want it to look like the whole William-and-Kate affair,\\" she said. \\"As for her dress, I'm sure with Mrs Branning and Mrs Cotton interfering, it could be anything from a lacy number to a meringue. Whatever they pick, it won't be very Heather-ish and it'll be completely out of her hands. She won't mind ‚Äî as long as the family pull together to make it a special day, she'll be happy.\\" Fergison said that there will be tension between Andrew and Heather's best friend Shirley Carter. In an interview with Inside Soap, Fergison commented: \\"Heather has put her trust in Andrew in a very short period of time. Recently she walked into the caf√© to see Andrew turn over a table in anger, so she knows he has a temper. But Heather really wants things to work out. She's aware there are alarm bells ringing, and whereas in the past she would have totally ignored them, she's more wary these days. But when better things override that and he's her lovely Andrew again, it's all fine.\\" Speaking about Shirley's take on the situation, she continued: \\"There has always been friction between Shirley and whichever man Heather gets involved with. I think she was even jealous of baby George when he was born. That means there'll be serious sparks as the friction between Andrew and Shirley grows. We're talking fire and brimstone! And that's going to bring out this other side of Andrew once more.\\" Faith Olubunmi Faith Olubunmi, played by Modupe Adeyeye, is the younger sister of Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu). Faith is one of three main characters in the third series of EastEnders spin-off EastEnders: E20, and the only one to appear in EastEnders as well.

Faith was sent to Nigeria by her grandmother Grace Olubunmi (Ellen Thomas) \\"to get back on the straight and narrow, but she is back and worse than ever!\\" She arrives in Walford to tell Mercy's husband Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) that she has had the marriage annulled and asks for his wedding ring so she can sell it. She stays with Grace and attends a party where she kisses several men. Faith later holds a party at Grace's house and she has sex with Fatboy but they are caught by Grace. The next day, when Faith returns home drunk, Grace slaps her and kicks her out of the house. In EastEnders: E20, she is unable to find anywhere to live so starts squatting with Donnie Lester (Samuell Benta) and Ava Bourne (Sophie Colquhoun). They attempt to feed themselves by stealing from local business. When there is no hot water, Faith has sex with Fatboy to get a hot shower. Faith is placed in emergency care by Grace, and the three discover that their squat is to become their hostel. While there, Faith and Donnie have sex, and Faith discovers that Donnie is illiterate but offers to help him learn to read. She is then rejected by both Donnie and Fatboy. She discovers that Ava was involved in an arson attack when she was younger and is using a new identity, and calls a newspaper to tell them this. Ava then tells Faith that she was raped by their keyworker, Richard. Donnie overhears this and Richard is arrested. Journalists arrive but Faith tells them she lied. She ends up soaking their new keyworker, Theresa. Faith distracts the press by wearing a bikini and confronting them on her doorstep, whilst Donnie and Ava seek out another entrance. Faith is described as someone who can be \\"an incredible amount of fun and excitement, and she has a cheekiness that charms most people. But she's not nearly as bright as she thinks she is‚Äîshe can sometimes be reckless and downright dangerous. When Faith runs into [E20 characters] Donnie and Ava, she sees it as her chance to cause even more mischief!\\" Faith also has a profile on Twitter. In September, Adeyeye told Digital Spy that she had finished filming for EastEnders. Craig Moon Craig Moon, played by Elliot Rosen, is the long-lost brother of Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), and son of Eddie Moon (David Essex). he character and casting was announced on 24 July 2011 and Craig first appeared on 16 September 2011. EastEnders worked closely with the Down's Syndrome Association whilst devising the storyline and were praised for \\"Presenting people with Down's Syndrome living successful lives.\\" A spokesperson for the show added they were committed to raising issues such as Down's syndrome. Yasmin Masood Yasmin Masood is the daughter of Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) and Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas). Yasmin is mentioned in two extra scenes available on BBC Online and BBC Red Button, called Amira's Secret, on 6 and 8 September 2011, when Amira reveals that no man will want her any more, as she has Yasmin. Yasmin appears in the second scene. Yasmin made her first appearance in EastEnders on 10 October 2011 and left the show on 12 November 2012. Yasmin made another one off appearance on 19 May 2014. Amira leaves Walford after finding out Syed is having an affair with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), though she is carrying a baby, which he does not know about. When Amira returns to Walford over a year later, she meets Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti), who believes she has come to discuss getting divorced. However, Amira reveals that she wants Syed to meet his daughter. Yusef tries to persuade her she is doing the wrong thing and that Syed will want custody of Yasmin. However, Amira goes to Syed and Christian's engagement party and tells Syed he has a daughter but she does not want Christian to have anything to do with Yasmin but Syed refuses to visit without Christian. However, he later meets Amira and Yasmin in the park. Amira tries to manipulate Syed into spending more time with her and Yasmin. Amira lies, saying that Yasmin has swallowed her ring, leading to Yasmin going for an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Yusef, trying to tear the Masood family apart, tells Christian that Syed may not be Yasmin's father so he and Christian get a paternity test done, taking a hair from each of them. However, Yusef, who is the local GP, swaps Syed's hair sample for one of his own. The test results then show that Syed is not Yasmin's father, causing consternation for those involved, though Yusef's falsification is subsequently exposed. When Amira leaves Walford, she leaves Yasmin with Syed and Christian. When Christian enters Yasmin into a \\"beautiful baby\\" competition, Syed becomes angry and refers to Yasmin as his daughter, not his and Christian's, leading to an argument between them. Amira returns a few months later as she wants Yasmin to live with her and her new fianc√© in Birmingham. Syed eventually agrees but when Christian finds out, he tries to stop her. Syed tells him that it is for the best and after agreeing to stay in touch, Amira and Yasmin leave after a tearful goodbye. However, Syed and Christian soon leave Walford to move nearer to Yasmin. In May 2014, Yasmin appears when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) visits Christian at his home in Birmingham, following the death of his daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater). Christian is looking after Yasmin whilst Syed is at work and Ian is affected by seeing Yasmin, telling Christian the sort of things to expect with having a daughter, and when she grew up. =Development= In August 2011, it was revealed that Amira had \\"[gone] ahead with the pregnancy and will come back with a little girl\\", and Kalidas promised a lot of drama. Kalidas said Amira still loves Syed after what he did, and that Amira wants to get back with Syed as she \\"doesn't want her daughter to grow up without knowing her father\\". She said that Amira cannot move on from Syed, as Yasmin is a constant reminder of him. Nina Wadia, who plays Syed's mother Zainab, said of the storyline, \\"I can't wait for Syed's baby to come. I think it will help Zainab and Syed get closer as she'll want her grandchild and it may make her feel like her son is a proper man.\\" Elliot said in May 2010 that Amira being pregnant was \\"a real shocker\\". Mark Garland Chris Simmons portrays Mark. Mark Garland, played by Chris Simmons, is a love interest for Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace). He first appears on 14 October 2011, when he is delivering alcohol to The Queen Victoria public house, of which Kat is a landlady. Mark tries to flirt with Kat but she tells him she is married. Mark later appears in the local nightclub, R&R;, where he tries to chat up Kat, this time succeeding and they have a one-night stand.

Sources of law The federal government and all the states rely on the following. =Common law= Common law is law developed by judges through legal opinions, as opposed to statutes adopted through the legislative process or regulations issued by the executive branch. A common law crime is thus a crime which was originally defined by judges. Common law crimes no longer exist at the federal level, because of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin, 11 U.S. 32 (1812). The validity of common law crimes varies at the state level. Although most states have abolished common law crimes, some have enacted \\"reception\\" statutes recognizing common law crimes when no similar statutory crime exists. =Statutes= All 50 states have their own penal codes. Therefore, for any particular crime somewhere, it would be necessary to look it up in that jurisdiction. However, statutes derive from the common law. For example, if a state's murder statute does not define \\"human being,\\" that state's courts will rely on the common-law definition.Keeler v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619 (1970) State vs. federal The states, since they possess the police power, have the most general power to pass criminal laws in the United States. The federal government, since it can only exercise those powers granted to it by the Constitution, can only pass criminal laws which are related to the powers granted to Congress. For example, drug crimes, which comprise a large percentage of federal criminal cases, are subject to federal control because drugs are a commodity for which there is an interstate market, thus making controlled substances subject to regulation by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act which was passed under the authority of the Commerce Clause. Gonzales v. Raich affirmed Congress's power to regulate drug possession under the Controlled Substances Act under the powers granted to it by the Commerce Clause. =Model Penal Code= The Model Penal Code (\\"MPC\\") was created by the American Law Institute (\\"ALI\\") in 1962. In other areas of law, the ALI created Restatements of Law, usually referred to just as Restatements. For example, there is a Restatement of Contracts and a Restatement of Torts. The MPC is their equivalent for criminal law. Many states have wholly or largely adopted the MPC. Others have implemented it in part, and still others have not adopted any portion of it. However, even in jurisdictions where it has not been adopted, the MPC is often cited as persuasive authority in the same way that Restatements are in other areas of law. Theories of punishment Principle of legality An overarching concept in American criminal law is that people may not be punished for committing merely immoral or unethical acts. They can only be punished if that act has been announced beforehand as a crime. Burden of proof In the United States, the adversarial system is used. The prosecution must prove each element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt for conviction.In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) Elements Crimes can generally be reduced to actus reus elements and mens rea elements. Actus reus elements are elements which describe conduct. Mens rea elements are elements which identify a particular mental state. =Actus reus= The phrase \\"actus reus\\" is typically translated as \\"guilty act.\\" Voluntary act Ordinarily, a voluntary act refers to commission. However, as discussed below, some crimes do punish failure to act. A status is not a voluntary act. For example, no law will be constitutional that makes it a crime to be addicted to illegal drugs, as opposed to using them, as happened in Robinson v. California.370 U.S. 660 (1962) =Omission= Failure to do something can occasionally be criminal. For example, not paying one's taxes is criminal. Typically, the criminality of failing to act will be codified. Certain relationships create a duty to act at common law, such as spouse to spouse, parent to child, or employer to employee, for example. A person may contract to act, such as a babysitter to render aid in the event of the child in their care hurting himself. A person typically has a duty to act when he is responsible for putting the other in peril in the first place, such as through accidental injury. Creation of reliance A person may have a duty to act when he begins to act but then stops. This situation typically arises in the hypothetical where a person is drowning. One bystander among many starts swimming out to rescue him but simply changes his mind halfway and decides to turn around and go back to shore alone. The rationale for holding the bystander culpable is that the other bystanders did nothing because of his act. If the bystander had been the only person around, he would not be causing others not to assist, so he would not be culpable. =Social harm= Criminal law is distinguishable from tort law or contract law, for example, in that society as a whole is theoretically damaged. Obviously, there are particular victims, but society as a whole is the party responsible for the case against and, in the event of a conviction, punishment of the criminal. Social harm is that part of the crime that is sought to be avoided. =Mens rea= The phrase mens rea is typically translated as \\"guilty mind\\" and focuses on the mental state of the accused. General intent is an awareness of factors constituting the crime; including attendant circumstances. The person must be aware that he is acting in a proscribed way and be aware of a high likelihood that attendant circumstances will occur. The requisite intent may be inferred from the doing of the act. A specific intent crime requires the doing of an act coupled with specific intent or objective. Specific intent cannot be inferred from the doing of the act. The major specific intent crimes are: conspiracy (intent to have crime completed), attempt (intent to complete a crime - whether specific or not, but falling short in completing the crime), solicitation (intent to have another person commit a crime), embezzlement (intent to defraud), first degree premeditated murder (premeditation), false pretenses (intent to defraud), forgery (intent to defraud), larceny & robbery (intent to permanently deprive other of interest in property taken), assault (intent to commit battery) and burglary (intent to commit felony in dwelling). A strict liability crime, however, does not require that a mens rea be found. The MPC also addresses intent. One of its major innovations is the use of standardized mens rea terms (in MPC terms, culpability) to determine levels of mental states, just as homicide is considered more severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally. These terms are (in descending order) \\"purposely\\", \\"knowingly,\\" \\"recklessly\\", \\"negligently\\", and \\"strict liability\\". Each material element of every crime has an associated culpability state that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. =Causation= Actual cause Actual cause (also called \\"cause-in-fact\\") holds that the defendant cannot be criminally liable unless it can be shown that he was the cause-in- fact of the prohibited result. In order to find a defendant guilty, a court must be able to affirmatively answer the question, \\"But for the defendant‚Äôs conduct, would the prohibited result have occurred when it did?\\" There are some exceptions to the but-for test, however. For example, in a case where multiple wrongdoers \\"overdetermine\\" the harm that a victim would have experienced. Proximate cause The requirement of proximate cause (also called \\"legal\\" cause) restricts criminal liability to those cases where the harmful result which ensued was a foreseeable result of defendant's conduct. It is often phrased that the harmful result must be the \\"natural or probable\\" consequence of defendant's conduct. =Concurrence of actus reus and mens rea= Concurrence means the mens rea (mental state or guilty mind) coincides with the actus reus elements. X hates Y and knows that she plays soccer every July 4 at a certain park. July 4, 2010, X goes on a high hill overlooking the field that Y is playing on, and then intentionally dislodges a large boulder, and directs it towards Y intending to kill her. If it kills her, concurrence is complete. Same situation, only the boulder rolls halfway down the hill, then gets lodged on a tree. X does everything he can to dislodge the boulder, but cannot do so. He gives up. July 4, 2011, the boulder becomes dislodged in a storm (or otherwise becomes dislodged in any way other than X dislodging it with the intention of killing Y). The boulder kills Y, just as X intended one year ago. There is no concurrence, and X committed no crime. Affirmative defenses There are two categories of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from excuses in that a successful justification will show the defendant's conduct was not wrong, whereas a successful excuse does not show the defendant's conduct was wrong. A successful excuse shows that, while the defendant's conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will not be subject to punishment. =Justification= Justification defenses are full defenses. Society essentially tells the actor that he did nothing wrong under the circumstances. Self-defense An accused will typically raise this defense when he is defending a crime of battery or homicide. Under common law, a person may use non-deadly force to defend himself from a non- deadly attack under certain circumstances. For one, he may not be the aggressor. Moreover, he must believe his force is necessary. Furthermore, that belief must be reasonable. In addition, the person must be facing imminent and unlawful force. Notably, the force the person uses need not be actually necessary. It need only appear so to a reasonable person. Under common law, a person may use deadly force to defend himself from a deadly attack under the same circumstances as for a non-deadly attack except that a person may not use deadly force if non-deadly force would suffice. Other justifications Other justifications include defense of others, defense of property, law enforcement, and necessity. =Excuse= Excuse defenses are also full defenses. However, society is not saying the actor did nothing wrong, only that it will not punish him under the circumstances. Intoxication can serve as a defense, with the law distinguishing between how voluntary and involuntary intoxication can serve as defenses. Mistake is another defense and can be a mistake of fact or a mistake of law. Other excuses include duress and insanity. Voluntary intoxication Voluntary intoxication can be a defense for specific crimes (attempt, solicitation, conspiracy and so on), but not for general intent crimes (assault, battery, rape etc.) Involuntary intoxication Involuntary intoxication can be a defense if you don't know you're ingesting the intoxicant like taking a prescription drug that causes unexpected intoxication and so on. However, intoxication due to peer pressure or addiction is not enough defense. Mistake of Fact Mistake of law Duress Insanity defense Crimes =Homicide= Only a human being can commit a homicide (as opposed to other legal persons, such as corporations). He does so when unlawfully he kills another human being. The two categories of homicide are murder and manslaughter. A person who accidentally causes a fatal car accident because they lost control on black ice and killed a child is still considered to have committed \\"homicide,\\" but is not punishable as long as it is proven that it was a truly accidental car wreck. While homicide is a word carrying a criminal connotation to the layperson, from a legal standpoint it is merely the \\"unlawful killing of another human being\\" and may not be punishable. Murder A human being commits murder when he commits a homicide with malice aforethought, an \\"endangering state of mind.\\" There are four ways to satisfy the element of malice. One is an intent to kill and is the only form of express malice. The remaining ways are implied malice. One is an intent to inflict great bodily harm. A third is a reckless disregard for the value of human life, sometimes called depraved heart. The last only applies when someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. It is often called the felony murder rule and only requires the person to intend to commit the underlying felony. Degrees of murder did not exist under common law. Most states have statutorily created at least two degrees of murder. Usually, a person only commits first-degree murder when he has express malice. If he has any other type of malice, he usually commits second-degree murder. American law reformed old world, common law practices during the ages of Henry VIII where even petty thieves were executed. American law generally categorizes the level of punishment and created lesser sentences, as opposed to the common law \\"one size fits all,\\" hence the first, second, third and fourth degree murder with different level of punishment. (See voluntary manslaughter) =First-degree murder= First degree murder is proven when malice aforethought accompanies \\"willful, deliberate and premediation\\" of the criminal homicide. Since it is the harshest degree of murder in terms of sentencing and societal punishment, a first degree murder must be especially premediated. Premeditation is the time and capacity to appreciate the enormity of the evil imposed. It involves weighing the pros and cons of one's own actions, and allowing one to think calmly, rationally and thoughtfully. A planned event, with a design to maliciously murder another human being, such as a gang member planning a contract murder or a serial killer outlining the steps to kidnapping his next victim, are committing premeditated acts when, if caught and charged, usually are proven to have committed murder in the first degree. =Second-degree murder= Second degree murder, however, initiated by any other crime which satisfies the general malice aforethought whereas \\"malice is merely implied.\\" The MPC does not categorize murder by degrees. Voluntary manslaughter Voluntary manslaughter is the lesser charge of homicide, lesser than murder, for a reason that has come down by American law taken from the felony murder rule doctrine of the common law. American society has come to understand how a loss of self-control, brought about through emotional states, can push a person toward murder when it is not rationally intended. Since Henry the Eighth, common law practices were harsh whereas petty thieves were executed, as well as criminals whose motives were understood as emotionally challenging to maintain self-control. Voluntary manslaughter, although punishable, is an intentional, malicious form of homicide that involves certain elements to justify this lesser charge. The \\"Heat of Passion\\" and \\"Cooling off Period\\" are subjective justifications that are argued in court, by attorneys, based on circumstantial evidence and establishment of motives where proof of a crime may not be fully ascertained. The ideas that a person, whom upon walking into his bedroom, observes his wife having sex with another male (his lifelong rival), reacts harshly, grabs a nearby gun, and within a matter of minutes, kills both of them, is less punishable than other forms of deliberate, premeditated and willful acts of calculated murder. A person is still \\"hot,\\" the heat of passion is so great that reason is dismissed and primal aggression takes over, but it was never the natural intention of the person ever‚Äîwith no evidence of ever having marital problems or the like. Because he or she walked in on his partner's infidelity and kills both of them within minutes, he or she has no chance to cool off. However, the heat of passion and cooling are subjective factors. According to the law, a murder charge can become a voluntary manslaughter charge if there is proof of \\"legally adequate provocation,\\" the objective test. This truly objective standard combines heat of passion and cooling off to determine them from the facts of a case. The question is, \\"Does the defendant have legally adequate provocation to have lost control?\\" In situations of infidelity described above, he does, according to America's general interpretation. (Facts of a particular case may override some of that matter, however). Insulting words alone cannot justify legally adequate provocation. Think about reasonably adequate provocation in terms of a stressful trigger to a loss of self-control. The law says insulting words, or words alone, cannot justify a trigger of criminal homicide. Your lover cannot call you a name, thereby making you justified in killing them. The legally adequate provocation must go beyond insulting words to events, situations and circumstances that surprise the defendant and trigger them to lose any sort of reasonableness without time to think through the consequences nor weigh the pros and cons. In this way, a court may establish a defendant, originally charged with second degree murder, to have been legally adequately provoked to commit the unlawful act of killing of another human being making his crime less punishable, but still punishable. Voluntary manslaughter results in a lesser charge than murder, but more than involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter Although Involuntary manslaughter is unintentional, the law requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of some form of malfeasance or misfeasance. Malfeasance is considered to be any dangerous, unlawful act (felony), misfeasance includes any act, even lawful, that is criminally negligent (misdemeanor). =Rape= American rape law has transitioned common law practices which grew out of a male centric legal interpretation to the feministic view it has today. A woman once had to prove absolute resistance against her aggressor, and rape reformation laws in America did away with the Hale Warning, corroborating evidence, and the early outcry doctrine and instead focused rape law reform onto the aggressive, coercive nature of the \\"rapist.\\" Marital rape law once required \\"forcible, unlawful and carnal knowledge,\\" and common law once believed husbands cannot rape their wives, so these incidents, if reported at all, were never charged. Women in America have reported more rape with these times, however, only 12% of rapes are currently reported nationally out of the thousands of offenses that occur. =Theft= Larceny Robbery Robbery at common law was the trespassory taking of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property by means of force or fear. Robbery charges result in substantial sentences which may be up to ten years with parole. Robbery with a deadly weapon increases this sentence and depends on the present ability of the defendant during the commission of the res gestae, or \\"the thing that happened\\". The precise language of this charge must be carefully reasoned to a jury panel by a trial court judge. In order for a taking to be \\"felonious\\", proof must exist beyond the defendant's animus firandi, or \\"evil in the heart\\". In other words, robbery is a charge reliant on the notion of possession of property of another and the force or fear used to accomplish the transfer of possession. According to the legal standard, a sleeping man cannot be aware that his property is being stolen. Therefore, a thief cannot be charged with robbery based on the force or fear prior to the incident requirement. The transfer of property cannot be a voluntary transaction. In looking at property holding, three major distinctions are made in cases where a charge of robbery is not inexplicably obvious. \\"Mere custody,\\" entitlement, and possession are the three levels of property holding and are specifically important to the precise language of the legal interpretation of what constitutes a robbery. If a person has mere custody of an object belonging to another, he or she is borrowing the object in question. If a citizen loans his vehicle to an associate to go to the grocery store, the associate must return the vehicle. If one purchases a new CD, the purchaser is entitled to the property because it becomes your own under your ownership. Possession, however, is acquiring an object of another without being entitled to it or allowed to possess it. A person charged with a robbery may have reasonably believed he or she owned the iPod, although they may have been incorrect. Possession, in terms of the legal interpretation of robbery, is 9/10 of the law. Possession, to charge robbery, must be a transfer of property acquired through force or fear. That is, a defendant must create fear through force in order to achieve the possession of the object or property in question, otherwise they may have committed another crime. A person who threatens another with future violence cannot be charged with robbery, because they did not use \\"force or fear\\", and insulting words alone cannot allow somebody to be entitled to self-defense. Therefore, a person who holds up victim with a deadly weapon, with or without present ability (bullets in the weapon that is charged and fails to meet its target-assault), and takes possession of a book the victim is holding, is committing robbery according to the law. The force or fear established by the defendant must precede the transfer of possession of the object in question. This can be said, also, as the transfer of possession must be acquired through the use of force or fear as the tool of attaining such goods in order to achieve all aspects of the legal doctrine imposed, \\"the felonious taking.\\" =Estes robbery (California)= Embezzlement False pretenses =Inchoate crimes= An inchoate crime is the crime of preparing for or seeking to commit another crime.

It is mainly used for hosting University Interscholastic League athletic competitions against rival school districts in the region. History The stadium was built in 1971 between C.E. King Middle school and C.E. King high school. In 1999, voters in Sheldon ISD passed a $97 million bond which included plans for new restrooms, ticket booths, and concession stands. In 2004 the stadium renovations were completed, resulting in improved access for handicapped persons. The bleachers kept the original -beam design, but the metallic stands were replaced with concrete ones which allowed for less restrictive seating space. In 2010, the stadium was once again updated to include professional grade track and field materials. The track was widened to 8 tracks and the surface was replaced with a 13mm thick synthetic surface composed of the Conipur SW system from BASF. In addition, the field grass was replaced with Desso D-Vision artificial turf. The home side bleachers also upgraded to include 22 inch wide theatre seats. The theatre seats are reserved for football season ticket buyers, those who make a one-time lifetime payment, and those who pay an extra fee at admission.

The Norwegian broadcaster TV 2 first publicly reported the existence of the network of SDUs, on 3 November 2010. Description In the year 2000, at least 22 United States (US) embassies and consulates around the world operated the US Department of State's \\"worldwide surveillance detection program\\", which \\"[emphasised] quasi- covert operations and information gathering.\\" The SDU operates under the authority of the RSO (Regional Security Officer) and stores the collected data in a system called Security Incident Management Analysis System (SIMAS). Norway Since 2000, former leaders of the police force of Oslo, the Norwegian Police Security Service, and the National Criminal Investigation Service have been recruited to conduct secret surveillance of Norwegians in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassy and the residence of the U.S. Ambassador. The unit consists of 15-20 people that were based on the sixth floor of the building Handelsbygningen at Solli Plass, several hundred metres from the embassy at Henrik Ibsens Gate, until the November 2010 controversy. Its leader, Olaf Johansen, was a former anti-terrorism chief before being recruited for the American unit. Knut Storberget, Norway's Minister of Justice, initially claimed the government was unaware of the program and that there would be an investigation, but later presented updated information to the Norwegian parliament after the U.S. Embassy stated that notification had been made. Norway television channel TV 2 claimed that the SDU's surveillance of Norwegian citizens was illegal. The head of the Norwegian surveillance agency, Datatilsynet, Bj√∏rn Erik Thon, said that the operation was unprecedented, stating \\"I think it's very serious that something like this can be conducted on Norwegian territory and that it's Norwegian citizens carrying out the work.\\" Thon stated that the SDU violated the Norwegian privacy law Personopplysningsloven. He said that he was disturbed \\"that the Norwegians employed by the embassy to, for example, take photos of persons engaging in political demonstrations, apparently have felt they can avoid the law because they were working for a foreign employer.\\" Parliamentary reactions ranged from \\"To the degree [it's] true, it's frightening information\\" from Conservative Party parliamentarian Andr√© Oktay Dahl to a \\"scandal\\" for Socialist Left Party parliamentarians. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re took up the surveillance issue with State Secretary Hillary Clinton in a meeting on 7 December. Finland In late 2010, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo/FSIS) initially stated that it was unaware of an SDU at the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland. The following week, SUPO stated that it was aware of US Embassy surveillance work, that the surveillance was legal and that it had consulted with the embassy. The US Embassy stated that it does have an SDU unit in operation and that the unit does not carry out espionage. Germany The German government initially said that it was unaware of the SDU program, but in December confirmed that the groups were providing security for U.S. installations and that some German security experts were part of them. A statement signed by Ole Schr√∂der, Secretary of State in the Ministry of the Interior, said that such measures were understandable in view of the security threat. Iceland A US Embassy SDU in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland has been \\"broadening security surveillance beyond the embassy building and into the immediate surrounding area.\\" The Icelandic Foreign Office stated that it had found no records of the SDU operations having been discussed with Icelandic authorities. The Vice-Chairperson of the Left-Green Movement parliamentary group √Ålfhei√∞ur Ingad√≥ttir, asked for the SDU to be investigated. Sweden Shortly after the initial report in Norway, the Swedish government confirmed that similar secret surveillance of residents of Stockholm had been sponsored by the U.S. Embassy there, and Justice Minister Beatrice Ask said that the authorities had yet to be adequately informed. She described the situation as \\"very serious\\". The Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat referred to 2000 Swedes under surveillance by the US Embassy's SDU in Stockholm.

He continued at Bishop's Cleeve as a conforming cleric, until the outbreak of the English Civil War, when he subscribed to the Solemn League and Covenant. About 1647 he became vicar of Beckford, near Bishop's Cleeve, where he remained until 1658. By the persuasion of a parliamentary officer who had a farm in Bishop's Cleeve, he returned to his old curacy there in the hope of succeeding to the rectory. From his published sermons it is evident that he had tired of presbyterianism and longed for the king's return. Immediately after the Restoration he delivered an ultra-loyal harangue on the text, \\"As whatsoever the king did pleased all the people\\"2 Sam. iii. 36 before the mayor and aldermen of Gloucester, but all his attempts to conciliate the court party proved unavailing. He remained at Bishop's Cleeve as minister until the Uniformity Act of 1662. He refused then to conform, and silenced himself; but he continued to attend services of the church. Some years before his death he moved to Gretton, in the parish of Winchcomb, Gloucestershire, where he died in the beginning of April 1686, and was buried on the 6th in the middle of the north side of Bishop's Cleeve Church in the presence of a large crowd.

Its aim is to encourage young people from European countries to take an active role in 'making a difference' to the world that they live in. The European Youth Congress (EYC) is a bi-annual gathering of around 100 young people from different European countries, who discuss and debate on social issues that are prominent in the world today. The main focus of the Congress changes from year to year, and subjects of conversation have included: Climate change, Environmental issues, the World economy, and YPFO's (Young people with fewer opportunities). Congresses Information on congresses has been taken from the website of Peace Child International. =The First EYC - St Donat's Castle, Wales, UK (August 2004)= The first congress, hosted in the attractive surroundings of the UK's United World College, Atlantic College, was a conscious Prepcom for the 3rd World Youth Congress in Scotland. Co-hosted by the Scottish Youth Parliament, all the workshop sessions focused on issues of volunteerism, social responsibility and international development to be discussed at the Scottish World Youth Congress. This EYC was perhaps most memorable for the moment when the bus carrying delegates to Scotland broke down causing everyone to stay overnight in Birmingham before traveling on to Stirling Scotland, where they took part in the Ministerial Announcement of the Congress. =The Second EYC - M√ºrzzuschlag, Austria (August 2007)= \\"It's Your Turn\\" was a 6-day event destined at European youth leaders and aimed at exploring good practice in youth-led community improvement project management. A mentored process, hosted in distinctive locations around the town (a ski museum, an 18th-century coffee bar, a railway carriage museum etc.) trained them in needs assessment and prioritisation, project design, scheduling, budgeting, permissions, resource and volunteer mobilisation, project implementation, evaluation and reporting. The meeting also had an excellent cultural programme and a fun opening day in the M√ºrzzuschlag ropes park ‚Äì where the team developed trust in each other. There was also a session discussing the EU-Africa Strategy with young Africans, and a World Caf√© discussing issues to be raised at the 2008 World Youth Congress in Quebec City, Canada. On the final day, the congress delegates were bussed to Vienna, where some of their project ideas were presented to, and discussed by a panel of experts at the UN Office in Vienna. The Congress closed with a day in the Austrian Alps ‚Äì visiting the historic and natural sites of special interest. A book on Youth-led Development was reviewed and analysed by delegates, and published by the Schumacher Society after the end of the congress. The partners, Peace Child International and United Games Austria also produced a handbook, It's Your Turn, listing all the projects developed by delegates during the Congress. =The Third EYC - Izola, Slovenia (August 2009)= The third EYC is a response to the growing young people's apathy in Europe. Besides trying to teach the right approach to criticism, the Congress enlightened an area considered as a taboo topic ‚Äì the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities (YPFO) in decision-making processes. As the YPFOs are considered to be all young people that have had difficulties to integrate in the society due to their background (mental or physical disability, ethnic or difficult family background, socio-economical status, sex orientation, criminal past, being an early school dropper, living in a remote area etc.), the event raised awareness about this specific group of young people that amount to 73 million in the European Union.

The field clearly distinguishes itself from the quantum mind as it is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum mechanical about the brain. Quantum cognition is based on the quantum-like paradigm or generalized quantum paradigm or quantum structure paradigm that information processing by complex systems such as the brain, taking into account contextual dependence of information and probabilistic reasoning, can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory. Quantum cognition uses the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to inspire and formalize models of cognition that aim to be an advance over models based on traditional classical probability theory. The field focuses on modeling phenomena in cognitive science that have resisted traditional techniques or where traditional models seem to have reached a barrier (e.g., human memory), and modeling preferences in decision theory that seem paradoxical from a traditional rational point of view (e.g., preference reversals). Since the use of a quantum-theoretic framework is for modeling purposes, the identification of quantum structures in cognitive phenomena does not presuppose the existence of microscopic quantum processes in the human brain. Main subjects of research  =Quantum-like models of information processing (\\"quantum-like brain\\")= The brain is definitely a macroscopic physical system operating on the scales (of time, space, temperature) which differ crucially from the corresponding quantum scales. (The macroscopic quantum physical phenomena, such as the Bose-Einstein condensate, are also characterized by the special conditions which are definitely not fulfilled in the brain.) In particular, the brain‚Äôs temperature is simply too high to be able to perform the real quantum information processing, i.e., to use the quantum carriers of information such as photons, ions, electrons. As is commonly accepted in brain science, the basic unit of information processing is a neuron. It is clear that a neuron cannot be in the superposition of two states: firing and non- firing. Hence, it cannot produce superposition playing the basic role in the quantum information processing. Superpositions of mental states are created by complex networks of neurons (and these are classical neural networks). Quantum cognition community states that the activity of such neural networks can produce effects formally described as interference (of probabilities) and entanglement. In principle, the community does not try to create the concrete models of quantum (-like) representation of information in the brain. The quantum cognition project is based on the observation that various cognitive phenomena are more adequately described by quantum information theory and quantum probability than by the corresponding classical theories (see examples below). Thus the quantum formalism is considered an operational formalism that describes nonclassical processing of probabilistic data. Recent derivations of the complete quantum formalism from simple operational principles for representation of information support the foundations of quantum cognition. The subjective probability viewpoint on quantum probability developed by C. Fuchs and his collaborators also supports the quantum cognition approach, especially using quantum probabilities to describe the process of decision making. Although at the moment we cannot present the concrete neurophysiological mechanisms of creation of the quantum-like representation of information in the brain, we can present general informational considerations supporting the idea that information processing in the brain matches with quantum information and probability. Here, contextuality is the key word, see the monograph of Khrennikov for detailed representation of this viewpoint. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally contextual. Quantum systems do not have objective properties which can be defined independently of measurement context. (As was pointed by N. Bohr, the whole experimental arrangement must be taken into account.) Contextuality implies existence of incompatible mental variables, violation of the classical law of total probability and (constructive and destructive) interference effects. Thus the quantum cognition approach can be considered as an attempt to formalize contextuality of mental processes by using the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics. =Decision making= Suppose a person is given an opportunity to play two rounds of the following gamble: a coin toss will determine whether the subject wins $200 or loses $100. Suppose the subject has decided to play the first round, and does so. Some subjects are then given the result (win or lose) of the first round, while other subjects are not yet given any information about the results. The experimenter then asks whether the subject wishes to play the second round. Performing this experiment with real subjects gives the following results: # When subjects believe they won the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round. # When subjects believe they lost the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round. Given these two separate choices, according to the sure thing principle of rational decision theory, they should also play the second round even if they don't know or think about the outcome of the first round. But, experimentally, when subjects are not told the results of the first round, the majority of them decline to play a second round. This finding violates the law of total probability, yet it can be explained as a quantum interference effect in a manner similar to the explanation for the results from double-slit experiment in quantum physics. Similar violations of the sure-thing principle are seen in empirical studies of the Prisoner's Dilemma and have likewise been modeled in terms of quantum interference. The above deviations from classical rational expectations in agents‚Äô decisions under uncertainty produce well known paradoxes in behavioral economics, that is, the Allais, Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes. These deviations can be explained if one assumes that the overall conceptual landscape influences the subject's choice in a neither predictable nor controllable way. A decision process is thus an intrinsically contextual process, hence it cannot be modeled in a single Kolmogorovian probability space, which justifies the employment of quantum probability models in decision theory. More explicitly, the paradoxical situations above can be represented in a unified Hilbert space formalism where human behavior under uncertainty is explained in terms of genuine quantum aspects, namely, superposition, interference, contextuality and incompatibility. Considering automated decision making, quantum decision trees have different structure compared to classical decision trees. Data can be analyzed to see if a quantum decision tree model fits the data better. =Human probability judgments= Quantum probability provides a new way to explain human probability judgment errors including the conjunction and disjunction errors. A conjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L and an unlikely event U to be greater than the unlikely event U; a disjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L to be greater than the probability of the likely event L or an unlikely event U. Quantum probability theory is a generalization of Bayesian probability theory because it is based on a set of von Neumann axioms that relax some of the classic Kolmogorov axioms. The quantum model introduces a new fundamental concept to cognition‚Äîthe compatibility versus incompatibility of questions and the effect this can have on the sequential order of judgments. Quantum probability provides a simple account of conjunction and disjunction errors as well as many other findings such as order effects on probability judgments. The liar paradox - The contextual influence of a human subject on the truth behavior of a cognitive entity is explicitly exhibited by the so-called liar paradox, that is, the truth value of a sentence like \\"this sentence is false\\". One can show that the true-false state of this paradox is represented in a complex Hilbert space, while the typical oscillations between true and false are dynamically described by the Schr√∂dinger equation. =Knowledge representation= Concepts are basic cognitive phenomena, which provide the content for inference, explanation, and language understanding. Cognitive psychology has researched different approaches for understanding concepts including exemplars, prototypes, and neural networks, and different fundamental problems have been identified, such as the experimentally tested non classical behavior for the conjunction and disjunction of concepts, more specifically the Pet-Fish problem or guppy effect, and the overextension and underextension of typicality and membership weight for conjunction and disjunction. By and large, quantum cognition has drawn on quantum theory in three ways to model concepts. # Exploit the contextuality of quantum theory to account for the contextuality of concepts in cognition and language and the phenomenon of emergent properties when concepts combine # Use quantum entanglement to model the semantics of concept combinations in a non-decompositional way, and to account for the emergent properties/associates/inferences in relation to concept combinations #Use quantum superposition to account for the emergence of a new concept when concepts are combined, and as a consequence put forward an explanatory model for the Pet-Fish problem situation, and the overextension and underextension of membership weights for the conjunction and disjunction of concepts. The large amount of data collected by Hampton on the combination of two concepts can be modeled in a specific quantum-theoretic framework in Fock space where the observed deviations from classical set (fuzzy set) theory, the above-mentioned over- and under- extension of membership weights, are explained in terms of contextual interactions, superposition, interference, entanglement and emergence. And, more, a cognitive test on a specific concept combination has been performed which directly reveals, through the violation of Bell's inequalities, quantum entanglement between the component concepts. =Human memory= The hypothesis that there may be something quantum-like about the human mental function was put forward with the quantum entanglement formula which attempted to model the effect that when a word's associative network is activated during study in memory experiment, it behaves like a quantum-entangled system. Models of cognitive agents and memory based on quantum collectives have been proposed by Subhash Kak. But he also points to specific problems of limits on observation and control of these memories due to fundamental logical reasons. =Semantic analysis and information retrieval= The research in (iv) had a deep impact on the understanding and initial development of a formalism to obtain semantic information when dealing with concepts, their combinations and variable contexts in a corpus of unstructured documents. This conundrum of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) on the web ‚Äì and data bases in general ‚Äì can be addressed using the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. As basic steps, (a) K. Van Rijsbergen introduced a quantum structure approach to IR, (b) Widdows and Peters utilised a quantum logical negation for a concrete search system, and Aerts and Czachor identified quantum structure in semantic space theories, such as latent semantic analysis. Since then, the employment of techniques and procedures induced from the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory ‚Äì Hilbert space, quantum logic and probability, non-commutative algebras, etc. ‚Äì in fields such as IR and NLP, has produced significant results. =Human perception= Bi-stable perceptual phenomena is a fascinating topic in the area of perception. If a stimulus has an ambiguous interpretation, such as a Necker cube, the interpretation tends to oscillate across time. Quantum models have been developed to predict the time period between oscillations and how these periods change with frequency of measurement.Atmanspacher, H., Filk, T., Romer, H. (2004). Quantum zeno features of bi-stable perception. Biological Cybernetics 90, 33‚Äì40.

Gestalt perception There are apparent similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum theory. In an article discussing the application of Gestalt to chemistry, Anton Amann writes: \\"Quantum mechanics does not explain Gestalt perception, of course, but in quantum mechanics and Gestalt psychology there exist almost isomorphic conceptions and problems: *Similarly as with the Gestalt concept, the shape of a quantum object does not a priori exist but it depends on the interaction of this quantum object with the environment (for example: an observer or a measurement apparatus). *Quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception are organized in a holistic way. Subentities do not necessarily exist in a distinct, individual sense. *In quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception objects have to be created by elimination of holistic correlations with the 'rest of the world'.\\"Anton Amann: The Gestalt Problem in Quantum Theory: Generation of Molecular Shape by the Environment, Synthese, vol. 97, no. 1 (1993), pp. 125‚Äì156, jstor 20117832 Each of the points mentioned in the above text in a simplified manner (Below explanations correlate respectively with the above-mentioned points): * As an object in quantum physics doesn't have any shape until and unless it interacts with its environment; Objects according to Gestalt perspective do not hold much of a meaning individually as they do when there is a \\"group\\" of them or when they are present in an environment. * Both in quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception, the objects must be studied as a whole rather than finding properties of individual components and interpolating the whole object. * In Gestalt concept creation of a new object from another previously existing object means that the previously existing object now becomes a sub entity of the new object, and hence \\"elimination of holistic correlations\\" occurs. Similarly a new quantum object made from a previously existing object means that the previously existing object looses its holistic view. Amann comments: \\"The structural similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable, but even parables can teach us something, for example, that quantum mechanics is more than just production of numerical results or that the Gestalt concept is more than just a silly idea, incompatible with atomistic conceptions.\\" =Quantum-like models of cognition in economics and finance= The assumption that information processing by the agents of the market follows the laws of quantum information theory and quantum probability was actively explored by many authors, e.g., E. Haven, O. Choustova, A. Khrennikov, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov,Haven E. and Khrennikov A. Quantum Social Science, Cambridge University Press, 2012. for detailed bibliography. We can mention, e.g., the Bohmian model of dynamics of prices of shares in which the quantum(-like) potential is generated by expectations of agents of the financial market and, hence, it has the mental nature. This approach can be used to model real financial data, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov (2012). =Application of theory of open quantum systems to decision making and \\"cell's cognition\\"= An isolated quantum system is an idealized theoretical entity. In reality interactions with environment have to be taken into account. This is the subject of theory of open quantum systems. Cognition is also fundamentally contextual. The brain is a kind of (self-)observer which makes context dependent decisions. Mental environment plays a crucial role in information processing. Therefore, it is natural to apply theory of open quantum systems to describe the process of decision making as the result of quantum-like dynamics of the mental state of a system interacting with an environment. The description of the process of decision making is mathematically equivalent to the description of the process of decoherence. This idea was explored in a series of works of the multidisciplinary group of researchers at Tokyo University of Science. Asano, M., Ohya, M., Tanaka, Y., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., 2011. Quantum-like model of brain's functioning: Decision making from decoherence. Journal of Theoretical Biologyvol. 281, no. 1, pp. 56‚Äì64. Asano, M., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., Ohya, M., Yamato, I. 2013. Non-Kolmogorovian Approach to the Context-Dependent Systems Breaking the Classical Probability Law Foundations of Physics, vol. 43, no 7, pp. 895‚Äì911. Since in the quantum-like approach the formalism of quantum mechanics is considered as a purely operational formalism, it can be applied to the description of information processing by any biological system, i.e., not only by human beings. Operationally it is very convenient to consider e.g. a cell as a kind of decision maker processing information in the quantum information framework. This idea was explored in a series of papers of the Swedish-Japanese research group using the methods of theory of open quantum systems: genes expressions were modeled as decision making in the process of interaction with environment. Asano, M., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., Ohya, M., Tanaka, Y. Yamato, I. 2012. Quantum-like model for the adaptive dynamics of the genetic regulation of E. coli‚Äôs metabolism of glucose/lactose. System Synthetic Biology vol. 6(1‚Äì2) pp. 1‚Äì7. History Here is a short history of applying the formalisms of quantum theory to topics in psychology. Ideas for applying quantum formalisms to cognition first appeared in the 1990s by Diederik Aerts and his collaborators Jan Broekaert, Sonja Smets and Liane Gabora, by Harald Atmanspacher, Robert Bordley, and Andrei Khrennikov. A special issue on Quantum Cognition and Decision appeared in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology (2009, vol 53.), which planted a flag for the field. A few books related to quantum cognition have been published including those by Khrennikov (2004, 2010), Ivancivic and Ivancivic (2010), Busemeyer and Bruza (2012), E. Conte (2012). The first Quantum Interaction workshop was held at Stanford in 2007 organized by Peter Bruza, William Lawless, C. J. van Rijsbergen, and Don Sofge as part of the 2007 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. This was followed by workshops at Oxford in 2008, Saarbr√ºcken in 2009, at the 2010 AAAI Fall Symposium Series held in Washington, D.C., 2011 in Aberdeen, 2012 in Paris, and 2013 in Leicester. Tutorials also were presented annually beginning in 2007 until 2013 at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society. A Special Issue on Quantum models of Cognition appeared in 2013 in the journal Topics in Cognitive Science. =Related theories= It was suggested by theoretical physicists David Bohm and Basil Hiley that mind and matter both emerge from an \\"implicate order\\".B.J. Hiley: Particles, fields, and observers, Volume I The Origins of Life, Part 1 Origin and Evolution of Life, Section II The Physical and Chemical Basis of Life, pp. 87‚Äì106 (PDF) Bohm and Hiley's approach to mind and matter is supported by philosopher Paavo Pylkk√§nen.Basil J. Hiley, Paavo Pylkk√§nen: Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework. In Paavo Pylkk√§nen and Tere Vad√©n (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, , pages 119‚Äì144 Pylkk√§nen underlines \\"unpredictable, uncontrollable, indivisible and non- logical\\" features of conscious thought and draws parallels to a philosophical movement some call \\"post-phenomenology\\", in particular to Pauli Pylkk√∂'s notion of the \\"aconceptual experience\\", an unstructured, unarticulated and pre-logical experience. p. 83‚Äì84. The mathematical techniques of both Conte's group and Hiley's group involve the use of Clifford algebras. These algebras account for \\"non-commutativity\\" of thought processes (for an example, see: noncommutative operations in everyday life). However, an area that needs to be investigated is the concept lateralised brain functioning. Some studies in marketing have related lateral influences on cognition and emotion in processing of attachment related stimuli.

Wikipedia has articles about other meanings of the term: Kuyalnik (meaning). Background Sheet: Sea, Coastal Countries ... Kuyalnik estuary. Location map: UkraineKyyal'nyts'ka estuaryKyyal'nyts'kyi estuary Kuyalnytsia estuary in Ukraine General characteristics Below the river Big Kuyalnik Area, depending on the water level, ranges from 52‚Äì60 km¬≤. Length - 28 km, width more than 3 km. The average depth is about 1 m. The volume is about 52 million m¬≥. It is separated from the sea by a sandy Kuyalnytsky-Hajibeysky crossing up to 3 km wide. The Big Kuyalnik River flows into the estuary. The lowest point of Ukraine is located near the Kuyalnytsia estuary: 5 meters below sea level. On the southeast coast of the estuary there is a mud Kuyalnytsky resort, on the banks of the estuary - beaches. The water temperature reaches 28-30 ¬∞C in summer. Once on the place of Kuyalnytsia estuary was located the mouth of the river Big Kuyalnik. Over time, the mouth turned to the Gulf of the Black Sea, and then due to the deposition of river and sea sand formed an overflow, and thus the gulf turned into an estuary. Separation from the sea took place in about the fourteenth century, much later than the branch located near the Hajibeyan estuary. This can be judged at least by the fact that Kuyalnik's overflow is three times narrower than that of Hajibey. The water level in the estuary and its salinity are regularly changed. Long-standing observations have shown that between 1878 and 1968 salinity in the estuary ranged from 29 to 269 ‚Ä∞. During the years with high salinity, salt precipitated at the bottom of the estuary. In the dry years, when the Great Kuyalnik River dried up, the area of the reservoir decreased almost twice. Twice, in 1907 and 1925, seawater was launched to save the estuary from drying out. References * Starushenko L.I., Bushuyev S.G.

The name of the rebellion refers to Abaza Mehmet (or Abaza for short), an Ottoman pasha of Abkhazian origin. Sometimes, this event is considered as a part of the Jelali revolts. But unlike the other Jelali revolts the principal reason of the Abaza rebellion was the resentment towards the jannissary corps.  Background  The Ottoman sultan Osman II (1618‚Äì22), who laid a siege on Khotyn (in modern Ukraine, then a part of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth), could not capture the city. He blamed the unruly jannissaries for the failure. The jannissaries, once elite troops of the Ottoman Empire, had been corrupted during the stagnation era of the empire. Osman planned to create a new army based on Turkmens of Anatolia. Energetic but young and inexperienced, Osman II revealed his intent. This caused a jannissary revolt in the capital Constantinople. Osman was imprisoned and later assassinated by the jannissary partizans on 20 May 1622. This assassination caused a great shock in the Ottoman lands.  First rebellion  Abaza Mehmet was the governor of Erzurum. According to historian Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, he was a consultant of Osman II in his efforts to abolish the jannissaries. Shortly after hearing the news about the assassination, he began expelling and even killing the jannissaries on duty in his province. Although he was formally dismissed by the Ottoman Porte (government) on 17 November 1622, he continued to stay in Erzurum and claimed that he was loyal to the Porte but he was trying to punish those who were responsible for the assassination. The Turkmen people of Central Anatolia, who were also accusing the jannissaries, readily accepted his cause and soon he began controlling most of Eastern and Central Anatolia.Lord Kinross: The Ottoman Centuries (trans: Meral Gaspƒ±ralƒ±)Altƒ±n kitaplar, ƒ∞stanbul, 2008, p295 In 1624, finally the Porte decided to fight against Abaza's forces. Commander () of the army was Hafƒ±z Ahmet Pasha. The clash took place in the plains near Kayseri on 16 August 1624. During the battle, some troops in Abaza's army changed sides and Abaza's forces were defeated. Abaza escaped to Erzurum, and during the ensuing talks he was able to convince the Porte for his good intentions.Joseph von Hammer: Osmanlƒ± Tarihi (condensation: Mehmet Ata) Milliyet Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, cilt II pp 175, 183-184 Thus he continued as the governor.  Second rebellion  During the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì1639), the Safavid (Persian) army was threatening the Ottoman city Ahƒ±ska (modern Akhaltsikhe in Georgia) in August 1627. Abaza was ordered to support the Ottoman army. Although Abaza asked for the commandship of the army, he was refused. He began to move his troops to the battleground. However, instead of supporting the army, he waited for a suitable moment to raid the Ottoman army. The raid was successful. In addition to jannissaries, many Ottoman pashas were killed. Upon this humiliating defeat, the Grand vizier Halil Pasha was dismissed. The new grand vizier became Gazi H√ºsrev Pasha. In September 1628, H√ºsrev Pasha laid a siege on Erzurum. He had cannons at his disposal. On 18 September 1628, Abaza decided to give up. H√ºsrev Pasha accepted his terms. Thus, he was not punished; but he was assigned to govern in one of the European provinces of the Empire, where he had no local support.Joseph von Hammer: Osmanlƒ± Tarihi (condensation: Mehmet Ata) Milliyet Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, cilt II pp 189-191 Prof.Ya≈üar Y√ºcel-Prof Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye Tarihi III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1991, p 69  See also  * Abaza Hasan Pasha  References  Rebellions against the Ottoman Empire 17th century in the Ottoman Empire Conflicts in 1624 Conflicts in 1628 History of Erzurum 1620s in the Ottoman Empire 1630s in the Ottoman Empire 1640s in the Ottoman Empire 1624 in the Ottoman Empire 1628 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Abaza rebellion"},{"id":"30139027","text":"Zgornja Pristava (, in older sources Zgornja Pristova, ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice in eastern Slovenia.

Canadians have differing cultural and political identifications which often overlap. Loyalty towards Canada is tempered by strong regional and ethnic identities, and an affinity toward a common North American culture shared with the United States. The largest and most-apparent differences are between English and French Canada, with the federal government recognizing the Qu√©b√©cois as \\"a nation within a united Canada\\".Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006 Among the provinces, Newfoundlanders also have a strong sense of national identity, having had a period of separate nationhood before joining the Canadian Confederation. Additionally, there has been a revival of Indigenous nationalism, identifying with a specific nation or with First Nations in general. Also common are diaspora nationalisms, with nearly every such community represented in Canada. Most Canadians see no conflict in being loyal to Canada while retaining a sense of ethnic identity and connection to the homeland. With an increasingly diverse cultural landscape in the country, some have advocated for civic nationalism based on shared citizenship and common rights.  Identifying nationalism  There has long been a recognition by scholars that English and French Canada have divergent views of the nation, often referred to as the Two Solitudes, from the title of a 1945 novel. The existence of multiple strains of nationalism within nineteenth century English-speaking Canada was first explored by historian Carl Berger in his 1971 book The Sense of Power and his article in The Journal of British Studies.  History  = First Nations, first nationalism? = In the historiography of nationalism there is significant dispute over whether true nationalism existed in pre-modern societies. Canada's First Nations peoples were generally organized into small societies which anthropologists call bands, which were sometimes part of a larger grouping called a tribe. Occasionally several tribes would form a larger group called a confederacy (the Iroquois, Seven Nations of Canada, Huron, Blackfoot, and Plains Cree-Assiniboine were or are confederacies). None of these resembled nations as understood in Europe in terms of scale or permanence. Today these groupings are referred to as \\"First Nations\\", representing their historical and modern role as sources of identity for many First Nations people. = Settler and refugee nationalism arrive = The first Europeans to exhibit nationalism in Canada may have been the French settlers who inhabited New France. They showed a great deal of loyalty and community in the face of repeated attacks by British and Iroquois rivals during the French and Indian Wars. However, by the end of the French regime in North America, acadiens and canadiens may have already been showing signs of developing identities distinct from France. The interrelated British ideologies of nationalism, unionism, loyalism, and imperialism arrived first in Newfoundland then the Maritimes, and finally in Central Canada with British traders who followed the British Army into these regions as each was successively won from France, ending with the Treaty of Paris (1763). They were reinforced from the 1770s to 1810s by the United Empire Loyalists: pro-British refugees fleeing the American Revolution. = Rival nationalisms under British rule = Reactions to British and American encroachments produced movements for solidarity between native tribes across much of eastern North America during Pontiac's Rebellion of 1759 and Tecumseh's Rebellion of 1811. By the end of the War of 1812, however, natives had lost their national sovereignty across most of Eastern Canada. The influx of British settlers into Canada helped to prompt the development of French-Canadian nationalism which was quite evident during the 1837 rebellion against British rule in Lower Canada. At the same time a few English-speakers in Upper Canada were switching from a British to a Canadian form of identity, as evidenced in the contemporaneous Upper Canada Rebellion, although this was a minority position. Not long afterwards, many English-speakers in Canada became attracted to American nationalism, in the form of annexationism, highlighted by the Montreal Annexation Manifesto of 1850. Irish nationalism in its strong form of physical force Irish republicanism was evident in Canada during the Fenian Raids of the 1860s and assassination of Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868. = Nationalism and Confederation = When the Canadian Confederation was established in 1867, British and Canadian forms of identity and political allegiance continued to coexist. In 1891 election, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, himself a Scotsman, wrapped himself in the Union Jack, swore to keep Canada British, and called proposals for freer trade with the United States \\"veiled treason\\". In Western Canada, native tribes retained their autonomy from Canadian society far longer than in the east. The interaction of European and Canadian traders with Indians in the interior led to the creation of an entirely new nation, the M√©tis. Along with Indian allies, the M√©tis asserted their national rights during the two Riel Rebellions (1870 and 1885). = The turn of the 20th century to the Great Wars = The project of Imperial Federation (creating a federal government for the entire British Empire), had important advocates in English Canada (the \\"imperialists\\") around the turn of the 20th century, but it ultimately floundered due opposition from (\\"anti-imperialist\\" or \\"nationalist\\") French-Canadian leaders such as Henri Bourassa and Wilfrid Laurier, and to indifference in Britain. \\"British feeling\\" in Canada was in decline following the Alaska boundary dispute in 1903, in which Britain sided with the United States' border claims over Canada's. Imperialists in Canada tried to correct this with the creation of the Empire Club of Canada that same year. Newfoundland had persistently resisted offer to join the Canadian Confederation since 1867, and so was elevated to the status of a dominion in 1907, co-equal to Canada within the British Empire. This further solidified Newfoundlander identity and added a period of separate nationhood to the later mythos of Newfoundland. By the 1910 Canadian federal election ‚Äì which again centred on trade with the United States and also the creation of a Canadian Navy separate from the British Royal Navy ‚Äì Prime Minister Laurier complained that in Quebec he was called an imperialist, in Ontario a separatist, but, he protested, he was simply a Canadian. Canadian participation in the World Wars was both divisive and unifying in different ways. French Canadians resisted the implementation of conscription during the crises of 1917 and 1944, leading to an erosion of francophone identification with the Canadian federation. In contrast English Canadians, especially recent immigrants from England, rallied to join the military in large numbers out of a sense of British loyalism. They saw their experience of the war, fighting in the Canadian Corps, as \\"the birth of a nation\\", when Canada replaced Britain as their primary focus of loyalty. = After the wars = Canadian ties with Britain were loosened when Canada became fully legislatively independent of the United Kingdom by the Balfour Declaration of 1926, created its own citizenship law in 1946, and its own flag in 1965. Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, though Newfoundlander identity did not disappear. In Quebec traditional religion- and culture-focused French- Canadian nationalism was being replaced with a new state-centred Quebecois nationalism during the Quiet Revolution, leading many to adopt the goal of Quebec's secession from the Canadian confederation. This has for the most part been a peaceful movement, aside from a string of terrorist attacks by the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) in 1969 and 1970, leading to a government crackdown in 1970. Since the 1970s, there have also been movements that have sought to turn the habitual feelings of Western alienation into a movement for Western separatism or Alberta separatism, although these movements often overlap with annexationist movements. Also since the 1960s and 1970s there has been a revival of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada. This can take the form of identification with a specific band or tribe or with First Nations in general. Cree and Inuit nationalism in northern Quebec (which is generally mutually exclusive with Quebecois nationalism) lead to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (1975) which was concerned with native title over northern Quebec's crown lands. However the potential fate of northern Quebec if Quebec were to secede from Canada remains a point of controversy. Inuit activism (perhaps nationalism) has led to the creation of the federal territory of Nunavut (1994) and intra-provincial territories of Nunavik (in Quebec), Nunatsiavut (in Newfoundland and Labrador), and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (in the Northwest Territories and Yukon).  Present day  Diaspora nationalisms are quite common in Canada, with nearly every diaspora community in the world represented. Prior to the liberalization of Canadian immigration laws in the 1960s, the largest diaspora populations were groups with European or Near Eastern origins like Ukrainian, Irish, Azerbaijani or Armenian nationalists, and Zionists (people who support the existence of Israel). These have since been joined by groups from other continents, especially Asia, such as Punjabi Sikhs, Sri Lankan Tamils, etc. the two largest strains of nationalism in Canada are Canadian nationalism and Quebec nationalism. Most citizens of Canada have a strong sense of loyalty towards Canada and other Canadians, however this is tempered with strong regional and ethnic identities and an affinity towards a common North American culture shared with the United States. Most non-Aboriginal English-speakers in Canada consider Canada to be their \\"nation\\" and are hostile towards any proposals to divide the Canadian Confederation into smaller states, or join it to the United States. French- speakers in Quebec generally refer to Quebec, and not Canada, as their \\"nation\\" ‚Äì although they may also have a strong sense of Canadian-ness and many \\"soft nationalists\\" are federalists (wanting to remain in Canada) rather than sovereigntists (seeking separation). Linguistic minorities (French- speakers outside of Quebec and English-speakers in Quebec) tend to be passionately pro-Canadian, seeing the continuation of Confederation as their only guarantee of continued cultural survival. A minority of the public in provinces other than Quebec also think of their province as their main source of loyalty, instead of Canada. Aboriginal peoples may (or may not) think of their band or tribe as their primary sources of identification, and may at the same time reject Canada as a colonial state or feel no animosity towards Canada (although resentment of perceived instances of racism is high). Recent immigrant groups are often accused in the populist media of being insufficiently loyal to Canada (e.g. being called \\"Canadians of convenience\\"). According to the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be seen as a multinational country. All Canadians are members of Canada as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, and this is a community that contains many other kinds within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, and civic (the provincial and municipal governments) sorts, but also national communities, which often include or overlap with many of the other kinds. He thus recognizes the following nations within Canada: those formed by the various aboriginal First Nations, that of Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians. Since 2018, the Canadian Yellow Vest movement has increasingly defined itself as defending Old Stock Canadians against a right-wing idea known as the Great Replacement.

In January 2018, while serving as provost of the American University of Malta, Ryder presided over the firing of all 13 of the faculty who were still in their probation period just weeks before the second semester began. Brian Leiter referred to Ryder as the ‚Äúaxeman‚Äù because of his significant role in this controversial decision. Weeks later he hired two replacement faculty who jeopardized the institution‚Äôs accreditation, one a proven plagiarist and the other a holder of fraudulent credentials. In July 2019, Ryder announced that he had decided to retire and would therefore resign from his position as provost of the AUM, stating that he had fulfilled the terms of his contract, but would have \\"loved not to have had some of the problems or [made some of the] mistakes\\" he did. In a three- part interview with investigative journalist Lizzie Eldridge, Ryder elaborated on the problems and mistakes he had made while serving as chief academic officer of the fledgling institution. Scholarly activity Ryder is a specialist in American philosophy, especially American philosophical naturalism and pragmatism, its historical development, contemporary applicability, and its reception outside the U.S. His published work tends to focus on issues in systematic ontology and epistemology, and on social and political philosophy. He is the author of Interpreting America: Russian and Soviet Studies of the History of American Thought (Library of American Philosophy, Vanderbilt University Press, 1999), editor of American Philosophic Naturalism in the 20th Century, (Prometheus Books, July 1994), and co-editor of The Blackwell Guide to American Philosophy, (with Armen Marsoobian, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, Russian Translation by Lyubov Bugaeva et al., Amerikanskaya Filosofiya: Vvedenie [American Philosophy: An Introduction] US Embassy Book Translation and Publication Program, Moscow: Idea Press, 2008), and The Philosophical Writings of Cadwallader Colden (with Scott Pratt, Prometheus Books, 2002).

It is also dedicated to studying and bringing a new light on some elements in the history of various towns and regions from all around the world. It first directed its attention to the city and region of Nantes (France) and its historical link to slavery. The association is also active at international level by providing support to anyone interested in doing research on those dark chapters of human history. Shared values of liberty, respect, equality and solidarity and a concern for scientific accuracy in its understanding of historical, social and economic factors are core principles that underpin the association's work and projects. In choosing its name ‚ÄúShackles of Memory‚Äù, the association intended to: * recall the captives' shackles in African caravans, on slave ships and on plantations in the New World; * evoke the links in the historical chain which the populations concerned can relate to; * highlight the alliances which the people of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans can initiate for a renewed triangle cooperation based on respectful and prosperous relationships.  History  The Shackles of Memory Association was created in Nantes (France) in the early 1990s. It was indeed the history of the city and its region, coupled with the amnesia of this history, that prompted the creation of the association. Because they loved their city and wished to change the general denial of its past, the founders of the Shackles of Memory worked with the intention to bring Nantes and its inhabitants to confront their history, convinced as they were that memory can only bring better understanding to the world. = Nantes, a Slave Port = As early as the Middle Ages, Nantes established itself as a trading post for salt and wines with the rest of Europe. Its commercial and maritime rise took place at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century. Navigation and deep-sea fishing, especially cod fishing in the Newfoundland waters, developed, and Nantes also fit out a few privateer ships. Finally, exchanges with the first colonized territories became more numerous. In the 18th century, Nantes embarked in trading with the colonies and in the more risky, but often more profitable, triangular trade. The triangle trade was not Nantes's only outlet, but the high number of ships fit out there for the slave trade compared to other cities in the kingdom gave Nantes the reputation of the chief port for ‚Äúebony‚Äù traders (‚Äúebony‚Äù was a common euphemism used by the slave traders to refer to black slaves). The slave trade is considered today to have been the main driving force in Nantes's maritime expansion, in the 18th and 19th centuries. * From 1700 to 1750, Nantes operated the 2/3 of the French slave trade. * After 1815, when the trade was carried on illegally, Nantes fit out almost 70% of the French slave ships. * 1709 out of 4420 French slave trade expeditions departed from Nantes (about 40%), which means that about 450 000 black people were transported between the 16th and the 19th centuries by slave shipowners from Nantes only. = The Difficult Memory of the Slave Trade and Slavery = The study of the slave trade shows many of the pitfalls inherent to the ‚Äúduty of memory‚Äù on the dark chapters of History: How to establish a history with a firmer ground in attested facts out of fragments of collective memory, and to do so without giving way to simplistic ideologies, nor allowing political issues to encroach upon historians' work. The association strongly believes that in Nantes as in all other territories once involved in the triangular trade, any tendency to read the memory of the slave trade simply as the memory of the liberation of the slaves should be resolutely opposed. It is the association's belief that pragmatic solutions are sooner to be found in varied and uninhibited historical research than in apparent political reconciliations which often overlook the issue of memory. That is why the association is involved in a number of research projects and supports original instructive outreach activities, focused on the most recent discoveries in the memories of slavery. These vary according to where the events took place. Therefore, the association has established partnerships with universities from the three continents formerly involved in the triangular trade, the better to study the history of the slave trade as well as its consequences: this project includes the history of racisms, of miscegenation as well as the unique cultural exchanges which developed on each continent. The association's goal is to turn what used to be the shackles of the slaves into a historical chain that could help avoid hatred towards the enemies of yesterday as well as anachronistic, artificial penitence for the past. By encouraging the heirs of this past to look back with a new gaze and to fully acknowledge a painful history, the Shackles of Memory also seek to unite all peoples in one shared act of memory. = Creation of the association = While the French Association Triangle d'Eb√®ne was celebrating the tricentennial of the Code Noir (Black Code) in Nantes in 1985, more than a hundred highly acclaimed historians from around the world were gathered at the University of Nantes for an international conference on the slave trade (‚ÄúDe la traite √† l'esclavage‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrom the Slave Trade to Slavery‚Äù). This was the first time such a major event had taken place in France on the subjects of slavery and the slave trade. This event resulted in the creation of the Shackles of Memory Association by citizens from Nantes who cared to break the silence surrounding these issues and to do justice to the victims of the Atlantic slave trade and slavery. The Shackles of Memory were officially registered as an association under the French law of 1901 on associations in February 1991. The Shackles of Memory aim at reviving the memory and history of the slave trade ‚Äì which was considered legal until 1815, and illegal afterwards but was still practiced in France until 1830‚Äì and to do so in conjunction with communities, cultural organizations and citizens linked to that history (in France and French overseas territories, in Africa and in America).  The Shackles of Memory Exhibition  In the early 1990s, the Shackles of Memory Association, with the support of the municipality of the time, presented a great historical exhibition on the triangular trade and the role played by Nantes in it, at the Ch√¢teau des Ducs de Bretagne (Castle of the Dukes of Brittany). The exhibition was widely acclaimed in Nantes and, thanks to the support of the United Nations for Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in all of the African, American and European countries linked to the Slave Route Project. Since then, the association has developed and increased the number of its initiatives both in France and abroad, focusing on the best way to provide material to a general audience of all ages and to more specialized history researchers.  Initiatives and Achievements  Ever since its creation, the association launched a wide range of cultural initiatives such as exhibitions in France and abroad, international conferences and colloquiums among other pedagogical activities. The association also publishes its own journal and takes part in other types of articles and research publications. It provides material support to cultural and touristic development projects and policies with the help of its members and international contacts. = Exhibitions = The Shackles of Memory Exhibition (Nantes, Ch√¢teau des Ducs de Bretagne, 1992-1994 - \\"Les Anneaux de la M√©moire\\") Nantes was one of the main slave ports in Europe in the 18th century. It was for this reason, and in order to come to terms with this chapter of history and spread awareness, that the Shackles of Memory Exhibition was organized. It was the largest international exhibition to have taken place surrounding these issues. Its goal was to trace back the history of the Transatlantic slave trade such as it was operated by Europeans from the 15th to the 19th centuries. It was presented at the Ch√¢teau des Ducs de Bretagne in Nantes, from December 1992 through May 1994 and attracted over 400 000 visitors. File:Anneauxmemoire92 sceno entrepont.jpg File:AnneauxMemoire92 sceno sucre.jpg The Exhibition catalogue and a DVD featuring the themes tackled by the Exhibition were released by the association on this occasion.  Exhibitions in France and Abroad  After its first exhibition, the association was approached by several organizations and citizens from countries all around the Atlantic Ocean and called on to host or set up exhibitions and/or museums surrounding these themes. On the theme of the slave trade: * in Ouidah (Benin) * in Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville (Republic of Congo) * in Luanda (Angola) * at the Vill√®le Museum, in R√©union (French overseas territory) * in Port-au-Prince (Haiti), in 2004 * in Bamendjinda (Cameroon), since 2009 * in Paimboeuf (France), in 2010 * in Dschang (Cameroon), since 2010 On the theme of migrations: * ‚ÄúM√©moires de migrations. Tol√©rance, intol√©rance‚Äù (Memories of Migrations: Tolerance and Intolerance), an exhibition shown in Nantes (France) from October 1998 through March 1999. * a double touring exhibition entitled ‚ÄúDes bords de Loire aux rives du Mississippi‚Äù (From the banks of the River Loire to the banks of the Mississippi River‚Äù, which was presented in France and in the United States (Louisiana, Texas and Florida) in 1999 and 2000; * the exhibition ‚ÄúDe Fort- Caroline (1654) √† la vente de la Louisiane (1803)‚Äù (From Fort-Caroline (1654) to the Louisiana Purchase (1803)), presented in Florida in 2000. The Shackles of Memory also set up an educational exhibition about Nantes and the slave trade entitled: ‚ÄúNantes regarde son histoire du 15√®me au 21√®me si√®cle‚Äù (Nantes looks back on its history from the 15th to the 21st century). This exhibition was first set up in 2004 and led to a second edition in 2008. It can be freely used by any teachers, cultural centers, associations or communities interested.  Awareness raising campaigns for a museum on the slave trade and slavery in Nantes  As early as 1994, following the Shackles of Memory Exhibition, the association ‚Äì along with other associations from Nantes (such as M√©moires d'Outre Mer, M√©tisse √† Nantes, etc.) ‚Äì launched an awareness raising campaign and started lobbying local authorities in order to promote the creation of a great international museum on the slave trade and slavery in Nantes. The International Slavery Museum of Liverpool (UK), a first in Europe in this field, was created out of a similar impulse in 2007, as the United Kingdom was celebrating the bicentennial of the abolition of the slave trade. = Educational Activities = Since its creation, the Shackles of Memory Association has endeavored to bring historical knowledge into general use and to make the history of the slave trade, slavery and their modern consequences more accessible. Today, the association offers several activities surrounding these subjects.  School and Group Visits  The association provides the opportunity for schoolchildren, students and other adult groups to go on guided tours of downtown Nantes to explore its historical past as a slave port, its architecture, and the way political and trading elites interacted in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially focusing on the issues of the slave trade, slavery and abolition. The tours also tackle the issue of memory in the 19th and 20th centuries.

It was intended for individual visitors and tourists and provides all the information contained in the group tours. A shorter version, published jointly with the Nantes Tourist Office, is also available for free, both in French and English.  Educational Sets  The association's first educational activities were undertaken during the Shackles of Memory Exhibition at the Ch√¢teau des Ducs de Bretagne. The popularity of this first initiative with children and adolescents, school groups and teachers led the association to make a number of educational sets available to the public. These sets include a variety of documents (novels, children's books, historical surveys, comics, facsimiles and educational booklets) and are available for public use for an autonomous approach to this chapter of history with people of all ages.  Educational Exhibitions  These educational sets and exhibitions are available for rent. They are intended for school groups from elementary school (4th grade) to high school and also for the general public. They can be borrowed by schools, multimedia libraries, recreation centers and other associations. = Historical research publications =  The Shackles of Memory Journal  A Journal (in French), entitled ¬´ Les Cahiers des Anneaux de la M√©moire ¬ª (The Shackles of Memory Journal), is published by the association. It focuses on the themes of the slave trade, slavery and their modern consequences. This annual journal is released by the Shackles of Memory Association in conjunction with Karthala Editions (Paris). Each issue of the journal includes 10 to 15 articles by international researchers. Most of the articles published are based on the work of historians as well as sociologists, anthropologists, psychoanalysts, economists, and linguists specialized in these issues. The articles are selected by an editorial board directed by Jean-Marc Masseaut (October 2010). The Shackles of Memory Journal was meant as a space for dialogue, exchanges and discussion between international researchers of all ages, experiences and origins (European, American or African). The association also intended its Journal to be a forum for young researchers and African researchers, who might encounter difficulties publishing their work, to express their views. 12 issues were released so far, and number 13 is about to be released: * 1st issue (1999): The Slave Trade: History, Memory, and Consequences * 2nd issue (2000): Slavery and Collaboration in the Indian Ocean * 3rd issue (2001): The Slave Trade and Slavery in the Portuguese-Speaking World; the French Revolution and Slavery; Current Debates * 4th issue (2002): The Slave Trades in Africa; Black Pirates and Seamen of the Trade; Collective Memory * 5th issue (2003): Women in the Slave Trade and Slavery * 6th issue (2004): Haiti: Raw Materials * 7th issue (2004): Haiti in the World * 8th issue (2005): Cuba * 9th issue (2006): From Africa to the Far East * 10th issue (2007): Ports in the Slave Trade ‚Äì Nantes * 11th issue (2007): Ports in the Slave Trade ‚Äì France * 12th issue (2009): Artistic Creation, Slavery and the Slave Trade * 13th issue (2010): The Mediterranean According to its website, the association's purpose in publishing this Journal is twofold: 1. To enable historians to establish a universal and scientifically acknowledged history: * by gathering and circulating referential work on the Transatlantic trade; * by supporting research on other routes taken by the trade, either maritime or land routes; * by studying the structures and the evolutions of slave systems. 2. To raise awareness of the many legacies left by slavery and colonization: * by questioning the patterns and institutions which emerged from these confrontations; * by becoming conscious of the influence of past events on our cultural references; * by taking a closer look at the scars left by these traumatic events in the collective psyche and at the dynamics of identity construction.  Other publications  The Shackles of Memory also publish books, exhibition catalogues, DVDs and informational booklets: * an illustrated catalogue of the Shackles of Memory Exhibition (Ch√¢teau des Ducs de Bretagne in Nantes, December 5, 1992 to May 29, 1994). * a bilingual documentary film (French and English) about the \\"Shackles of Memory Exhibition\\". This film features the main themes of the Exhibition and displays the sets, objects, paintings and documents presented in the Exhibition. Available on DVD. 52 minutes. * An illustrated catalogue of the ‚ÄúMemories of Migrations from the Middle Ages to the 20th century: Tolerance, Intolerance‚Äù Exhibition, shown in Nantes from October 3, 1998 to March 31, 1999. * A discovery itinerary booklet with comments and illustrations of Nantes and its region, entitled: ‚ÄúThe Slave Trade from Barbechat and Nantes to Paimboeuf‚Äù.  The Shackles of Memory Research Center  In order to continue the work of memory which the association has carried on for several years, the Shackles of Memory, in conjunction with the University of Nantes, have created a research center focused on expanding and circulating knowledge and research about the Atlantic slave trade and slavery on the one hand; and about the varied instances of slave trades and systems of slavery that existed throughout History on the other hand. The Research Center publicizes the results of its research through an annual conference cycle open to all visitors. The Research Center's activities include: * coordination of conference cycles; * participation in colloquiums and conferences outside the association's circle. Conference and workshop cycles were initiated every academic year since November 2003. In 2010/2011, the central theme for conferences is ‚ÄúSlavery in the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking Worlds‚Äù, in conjunction with the University of Nantes. Seven two-hour conferences are scheduled throughout the academic year. Entrance is free to all. Up to 2009 the Research Center used to organize introduction to historical research workshops, in conjunction with the University of Nantes. The Research Center also participated in the CODES Project for research launched by the French Ministry of National Education. = International Conferences = The association organizes international summits aimed at strengthening cross- cultural relationships and projects between Europe, Africa and America. The circulation of historical research on the slave trade and slavery is also one of the objectives of these conferences. The following conferences were organized by the association: * ‚ÄúAfrica in Question‚Äù, in Nantes (France), 1993; * ‚ÄúThe Caribbean: New Exchanges between Europe and the Americas‚Äù, in Nantes (France), 1994; * ‚ÄúLegacies of the Past: Five Centuries of Relationships between Europe, Africa and the Americas‚Äù, in Dakar, (Senegal), 1997; * ‚ÄúThe Colonial Experience: Atlantic Exchanges in the Time of Slavery, from the 15th to the 19th century‚Äù, in Nantes (France), June 2005, in conjunction with EHESS Paris (French School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences). * ‚ÄúThe Slave Trade and Slavery‚Äù, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Arts, Traditions and Slavery Museum in Bamendjinda (Cameroon); * ‚ÄúCity and Slavery‚Äù Conference Project in Limbe (Cameroon), 2011‚Äì2012. = Data Base = The Shackles of Memory rely on data resources including old and contemporary books and documents on the following themes: * the Atlantic slave trade; * Atlantic slavery; * other forms of slave trades and systems of slavery; * abolitions of the Atlantic slave trade; * the legacies of slavery; * African and West Indian civilizations; * migrations.  International Activities  The various activities undertaken by the association since its foundation have led it to become a member of several international programs such as the Slave Route Project initiated by UNESCO, and to play a role in certain committees, such as the ‚ÄúCommittee of Reflection on French-Haitian Relations‚Äù, presided by R√©gis Debray. The association also initiated international exchanges, especially with Haiti and Africa. In Antananarivo (Madagascar) in 2005 for instance, the association prompted the creation of an ‚ÄúInternational Alliance of the Shackles of Memory‚Äù with several cities historically involved in the slave trade and slavery. = Partnerships with UNESCO = The association has been a member of the scientific committee for UNESCO's Slave Route Project's, and thus took part in international summits in Ouidah (Benin), Havana (Cuba), Luanda (Angola), Nantes (France), Palermo (Italy) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). It still maintains relationships with this committee today. The association is responsible for the coordination of the ‚ÄúSlavery, Museums and Exhibitions‚Äù network, and especially the scientific research Program linked to the Slave Route Project. = A Special Bond with the Republic of Haiti = The former Island of Saint-Domingue (Hispaniola) holds a special place in the historical work on slavery and the slave trade. The Shackles of Memory Association has created many ties with the Republic of Haiti, the first Black Republic, born out of the rebellion of slaves against their masters in the wake of the French Revolution.  The ¬´ Committee of Reflection on French-Haitian Relations ¬ª presided by R√©gis Debray  The Shackles of Memory Association took part in the ¬´ Committee of Reflection on French-Haitian Relations ¬ª created by former President of France Jacques Chirac, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the Independence of the Republic of Haiti (1804‚Äì2004). This committee was presided by Professor R√©gis Debray, who wrote a report suggesting various options for a renewal of relationships between France and Haiti. Yvon Chotard, who took part in this committee as President of the Shackles of Memory Association, pointed to efforts in two specific directions: * the work of memory and history between France and Haiti; * expansion and renewal of decentralized cooperation between towns from both countries. R√©gis Debray submitted his report to French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin in January 2004.  The Society of Friends of the Haitian Republic  In 2005, the association and the city of Nantes jointly prompted the creation of the Society of Friends of the Haitian Republic, bringing together the work of communities, non-profit associations and NGOs, and individuals. It was presided by R√©gis Debray and was aimed at coordinating the cooperation between local communities on one side, and between NGOs on the other side, and avoid overlapping of their activities.  The Shackles of Memory Journal on Haiti  Special attention was given to the 2004 edition of the Shackles of Memory Journal: two special editions featuring many color illustrations were released on that theme as a way to celebrate the bicentennial of the independence of Haiti (1804‚Äì2004). For these two special editions, the Shackles of Memory worked together with Myriam Cottias, researcher at the University of Antilles-Guyane and at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris).  Exhibition in Haiti for the bicentennial of Haitian independence  The association was asked to present a similar exhibition to the one held in Nantes in 1992-1994 about the slave trade and slavery in Port- au-Prince. This exhibition entitled ‚Äú1804-2004: One Land, One People, One Nation‚Äù was to trace back and illuminate the history of the Haitian nation from the origins to independence. This exhibition was to be shown in the center of Port-au-Prince, on the Champ de Mars plaza. The association had appointed the same designers as for the exhibition in Nantes: Jean-Pierre Chesn√©, then director of the International Rochefort Sea Center, and Pierre Combes, the curator of the exhibition. However, due to the deterioration of relations between the French and Haitian authorities, the withdrawal of financial partners (the French Embassy in Haiti and the European Union), and concerns that the exhibition might be misused, the Shackles of Memory decided to put an end to this project.  Cultural Support Program for the Shackles of Memory in Haiti  Nevertheless, since 2004 the association has kept working in collaboration with the Haitian Minister of Culture and various cultural institutions such as the Mus√©e du Panth√©on National Ha√Øtien (Haitian National Pantheon Museum) towards the elaboration of a cultural development program (including training courses for the preservation of historical documents, expertise sharing, exchanges of exhibitions, partnerships for archives...). One particular initiative calls for special credits: Marie-Lucie Vendryes, former director of the Mus√©e du Panth√©on National Ha√Øtien, presented a historical exhibition in Haiti for the bicentennial of Independence entitled: ‚ÄúFrom Ayiti to Haiti: Freedom Gained‚Äù. Thanks to support from the French Embassy and the Shackles of Memory, this exhibition was transformed into a touring exhibition comprising thirty educational panels. This bilingual exhibition (French-Creole) is kept available to the general public and has already been presented in several French cities and towns (such as Angers, Le Mans, Nantes, Paimboeuf). It will likely be shown in Guadeloupe in the year 2011.  Development Assistance Program  As part of the Society of Friends of the Haitian Republic's agenda, the city of Nantes and the Shackles of Memory Association agreed in 2007 to examine the feasibility of a decentralized cooperation project with the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Sun City. Two estimates of Sun City's needs were carried out in November 2007 and January 2008 by the Shackles of Memory. These estimates enabled the association to get better insight into Sun City's situation and to meet Mr Robert Duval, founding President of Haiti's Athletics Center ‚Äì a sports (training) center for underprivileged children from Sun City. This association offers soccer, basketball, ping-pong and athletics training courses as well as hot meals and tutoring to over 1500 children from Sun City everyday. Haiti's Athletics Center was aimed at expanding its activities in a sector that would create jobs for Sun City's young workers, and thus created a green recycling center. This project received technological support from the French association CEFREPADE (French Center for Partnership Research in Decontamination, Waste Management and Environment), an association which is specialized in waste management in countries of the South and sent a volunteer to work on this project in Haiti. The creation of the recycling center was achieved thanks to financial support from the French Embassy in Haiti, the Shackles of Memory Association, the City of Nantes and the Loire Atlantic Region Local Council. The earthquake that occurred on January 12, 2010 destroyed a large part of the city center and suspended all activities for several months. Haiti's Athletics Center had to manage over 600 families who had taken refuge on its grounds after the earthquake. But the Shackles of Memory and the CEFREPADE still provide their support for this project and work to its completion, also in memory of Jean-Christophe Fernandez, delegate of the CEFREPADE in Sun City and who died during the earthquake at age 26. The sorting and composting work started again in April 2010 and the center will be entirely rebuilt by the end of 2010. = Participation in various Development Programs = The Shackles of Memory Association deemed it important not to restrict its action to cultural and educational initiatives but instead provide concrete proofs of solidarity to its partners from various countries. After the ‚ÄúAfrica in Question‚Äù Conference, which took place in Nantes in 1993, the association worked hand in hand with 3 associations from Burkina Faso to the completion of four decentralized cooperation programs: * Construction of a training center for the delegates of farmer groups (project manager: FONADES Association). * Construction of three town pharmacies (project manager: Promo- Femmes/ Developpement-Sport Association, an association for the advancement of women and the promotion of sports). * Construction of a local fruit and vegetable processing center (project manager: Pag-la Yiri Association) * Support for the purchase and use of solar ovens as part of an environmental strategy and for the improvement of women's status in the country (project manager: Promo-Femmes / Developpement-Sport Association, an association for the promotion of women and the promotion of sports). = Partnership with the Pays-de-la-Loire-Region and Cameroon Association = The Shackles of Memory also initiated a partnership with the Association Pays de la Loire-Cameroun (APLC), an association between the Pays-de-la-Loire-Region and Cameroon aimed at providing support to sustainable cultural and eco-tourism development in Dschang (West Cameroon). The Shackles of Memory Association supports the APLC Association in promoting Dschang and its region's cultural heritage, and drawing attention to historical connections between local history and the larger history of the slave trade and slavery. The Shackles of Memory Association is partner of the ‚ÄòRoute des Chefferies‚Äô Project, an initiative of the APLC Association and many Bamileke chefferies. = The Shackles of Memory International Alliance (SMIA) = Since 2005, the Shackles of Memory Association, represented by its President Yvon Chotard, acted as secretary to the International Alliance Network, whose creation it had initiated. The International Alliance met in Nantes (France) in 2006 and 2008 and in Limbe (Cameroon) in 2009. This network involves actors from the three continents related to the history of the slave trade and slavery (Europe, Africa, America). It is aimed at sharing knowledge and furthering research on this common past as well as setting up concrete development and cultural mediation projects (exhibitions, museums, conferences and publications). During the Limbe meeting, the International Alliance decided to organize into 3 departments: * towns and regions; * cultural institutions (museums, research centers, associations...); * individuals (researchers, movie directors, novelists...). Former President of the Republic of Benin and Mayor of Cotonou, Nic√©phore Dieudonn√© Soglo, presided the Alliance. A number of municipalities (such as Nantes, Cotonou, Abomey, Ouidah, Dakar, La Rochelle and Lorient) meeting in Nantes in June 2010, suggested turning the Shackles of Memory International Alliance (SMIA) into an ‚ÄúInternational Alliance of Cities for the Duty of Memory and Development‚Äù. The Shackles of Memory Association expressed the wish to become a member and partner of this new structure, which was granted by the delegates of the towns present in Nantes. Former President of the Shackles of Memory International Alliance, Nic√©phore Dieudonn√© Soglo was then appointed President of this new formation. The Shackles of Memory wanted indeed to maintain relationships with the municipalities previously met, even those which decided to create their own specific structures. The association remains in contact with all municipalities interested. The association intends to keep up the Limbe meeting spirit which brought cities, cultural institutions and individuals together. In accordance with the mission it was given in December 2009, it seeks to reinforce the Shackles of Memory international network. This network is based on four main entities: * Nantes (France), representing Europe; * Haiti, representing the Caribbean; * Cameroon, representing Africa; * South Africa, especially the city of Durban, representing the countries of the Indian Ocean.  Digital Community Project  The Shackles of Memory Association is partner to the International Organization of the Francophonie (OIF), and benefits as such from the Francophonie's Project. The program operates along two complementary lines of action: * creation, online editing and coordination of the website of the Shackles of Memory International Alliance Network (an informational website kept by several contributors) on the themes of the slave trade, slavery and their modern consequences; * providing support to three partners of the Network from countries of the South (in Haiti, Senegal and Cameroon) in mastering information technology resources (IT) and using them in their network activities. These partners are the Mus√©e du Panth√©on National Ha√Øtien (Port-au-Prince, Haiti), the ‚ÄúArts, Traditions and Slavery‚Äù Museum of the Bamendjinda Chefferie (West Cameroon), and the University of Dakar's P√¥le d'Excellence R√©gional (Dakar, Senegal). The project is aimed at using Information Technology resources for a better understanding of the history of the slave trade, slavery and their modern consequences and at creating a community bound by shared knowledge and information.  Other Ongoing Projects  A variety of projects have already received support from the International Alliance and several of them are currently under preparation. The Shackles of Memory supported the creation of the ‚ÄúArts, Traditions, and Slavery‚Äù Museum of the Bamendjinda Cheffery (West Cameroon), which opened on December 12, 2009. The first part of this museum's permanent exhibition shows the history of Bamendjinda from its origins to the present day, the Cheffery's traditional and social organization and its cultural and religious customs. The second part of the exhibition is dedicated to customary slavery, and to the Cheffery's encounter with the global slave trade and its historical and social consequences.

It also owns advisory CFD business, SALT Invest, and futures provider, Daniels Trading. History GAIN Capital was founded in 1999 in Bedminster, New Jersey, and was one of the early developers of on-line forex trading. The company went public in 2010 when it floated part of its shareholdings on the NYSE; however, the initial IPO was scaled back at the last minute as the target price was not reached. In October 2014 the company acquired UK-based rival City Index for $118 million, boosting its CFD business and expanding its Forex business in the UK. On February 7, 2017, GAIN Capital agreed to acquire FXCM's US client base a day after the latter had been barred by the CFTC and NFA from doing business in the United States. The company paid $7.2 million for these accounts, $500 per account that traded within 76 days and $250 for accounts that traded subsequently. In February 2020, INTL FCStone announced the acquisition of US-based brokerage GAIN Capital Holdings Inc. The all-cash deal, approved by boards of both companies, was worth about $236 million in equity value.

Some, however, go unnamed in the Qur'an, but are referenced or referred to in the hadiths, tafsirs, literature or seerah. Other figures are mentioned elsewhere in tradition and in the sunnah and sayings of the prophet Muhammad. Such figures which are not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, are included below. Old Testament =Cain and Abel= A Bible illustration depicting Cain and Abel offering up their sacrifices. Cain and Abel (Arabic: Ÿáÿßÿ®ŸäŸÑ,ŸÇÿßÿ®ŸäŸÑ; QƒÅbƒ´l and HƒÅbƒ´l) are believed by Muslims to have been the first two sons of Adam and Eve. The story in the Qur'an: \\"Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah. It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: 'Be sure I will slay thee.' 'Surely' said the former, '(God) doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous.' is virtually the same as the Hebrew Bible narrative, saying that both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, slew Abel. This was the first ever sin committed upon Earth but Abel was chronicled in history as one of the first believers and as the first ever martyr. A handful of Muslim sources have identified Abel as a prophet like his father, but this identification is not traditional.Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary, Yusuf Ali, note. 57: \\"The slaying of the prophets begins with the murder of Abel, who was in the ancestry of Israel.\\" Story of Cain and Abel Of Adam's first children, Cain was the elder son and Abel the younger. Each of them presented a sacrifice to God but it was accepted only from Abel, because of the latter's righteous attitude and his faith and firm belief in Allah. =Cain speaks to Abel= After the offering of their sacrifices, Cain, the wicked sibling, taunted Abel out of envy and told him that he would surely slay him. Abel justly warned Cain that God only accepted the sacrifice of those that are righteous in their doings. He further went onto tell Cain that if Cain did indeed try to slay him,: \\"'If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee': for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds.'\\" Abel would not retaliate and slay him because the God-fearing would never murder for the sake of envy. Abel then told Cain that in murdering him, he would carry the weight not only of his sin but also of the sins of his victim: \\"'For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.'\\" The victim, as a result, in suffering the injustice, would be forgiven his own sins and the murderer, while being warned, would consequently increase his own sin. Abel preached powerfully and reminded Cain that the punishment for murder would be that he would spend the afterlife in the fires of Hell. =Cain slays Abel= The innocent pleading and preaching of Abel had no effect upon Cain, for he was full of arrogance, pride and jealousy. He subsequently slew: \\"The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones.\\" the righteous Abel, but in doing so, he ruined himself and became of those who remain lost. This would be the earliest example of the murder of a righteous man taking place upon the earth. In the future, many other evildoers would slay the wise and pious believers. =Shame of Cain= Right after the murder took place, God sent a raven who scratched the ground to show Cain how to hide the body of dead person. Cain, in his shame, began to curse himself: \\"Then God sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. 'Woe is me!' said he. 'Was I not even able to be as this raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?' Then he became full of regrets.\\" and he became full of guilt. The thought of the crime at last came to the murderer, as he realized indeed how dreadful it was to slay anyone, the more so as the victim was an innocent and righteous man. Full of regrets, Cain was marked with deep sorrow. This was, however, no true repentance. Message and moral God makes it clear in the Qur'an that the story of Cain and Abel was a message: \\"On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our apostles with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.\\" for the Children of Israel, as it had told them about the consequences of murder and that the killing of one person would be as if he/she had slain the whole of mankind. But still people rejected the message, of the story and continued to commit grave sins, slaying prophets, messengers as well as the righteous people. All the prophets who preached since the time of Adam were persecuted, insulted or reviled in one way or another. With some righteous men, however, the evildoers went one step further, in attempting to slay them or indeed slaying them. The Qur'an itself mentions the slaying of the righteous, saying \\"As to those who deny the Signs of Allah and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty.\\". Historical examples of the righteous slain include Zacharias, son of Barachias,: \\"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.\\" Uriah: \\"And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.\\" and, in later Islamic history, Hamzah, Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Hasan and Husayn, Umar ibn Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan. =Sarah= Sarah, as depicted on Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum by Guillaume Rouill√© Sarah (Arabic: ÿ≥ÿßÿ±ÿ©, SƒÅra), the wife of the patriarch and Islamic prophet IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Abraham) and the mother of the prophet Ishaq (Isaac) is an honoured woman in the Islamic faith. According to Muslim belief, she was Abraham's first wife. Although not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, she is referenced and alluded to via the story of her husband. She lived with Abraham throughout her life and, although she was barren, God promised her the birth of a prophetic son and a prophetic grandson by the name of Ya\`q≈´b (Jacob). Story of Sarah Sarah and Abraham had no children. Abraham, however, prayed constantly to God for a son. Sarah, being barren, subsequently gave him her Egyptian handmaiden,Muhammad, Martin Lings, Chapter 1. The House of God, Suhail Academy Publishing HƒÅjar (Hagar), to wed as his second wife. Hagar bore IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l (Ishmael), when Abraham was 86,: \\"And Abram was fourscore and six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.\\" who too would become a prophet of God like his father. =The birth of Isaac= Thirteen years later, God announced to Abraham, now a hundred,: \\"And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.\\" that the barren Sarah would give birth to a second son, Isaac, who would also be a prophet of the Lord. Although the Qur'an does not mention Sarah by name, it vividly mentions the annunciation of the birth of Isaac. The Qur'an mentions that Sarah laughed when the angels gave her the glad tidings of Isaac, which is perhaps why the name Isaac (in Arabic Ishaq) has the root meaning of 'laughter'.Isaac - name meaning, origin Tomb of Sarah Sarah is believed by Muslims to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs (known by Muslims as the Sanctuary of Abraham). The compound, located in the ancient city of Hebron, is the second holiest site for Jews (after the Temple Mount in Jerusalem), and is also venerated by Christians and Muslims, both of whom have traditions which maintain that the site is the burial place of three Biblical couples: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah. Although Jews alternatively also believe this to be the burial place for Adam and Eve, this is a view not usually adopted by Muslims. =Balaam= Rembrandt's Balaam and the Ass In regards to Balaam in Islam, it is very doubtful whether there is any reference to Balaam in the Qur'an. Old classical commentators applied to him, but with reservations: Many modern commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, however, feel that the tale of Balaam was different and unrelated. =Jeremiah= Ibn Kathir considers Jeremiah (Arabic: ÿ£ÿ±ŸÖŸäÿß, Armaya) to be a prophet of Islam, though he is not mentioned in the Qur'an; in his book Stories Of The Prophets, places Jeremiah in the prophetic pantheon, alongside fellow Old Testament prophets Daniel, Ezekiel and Isaiah. Scholars believe that Jeremiah was a descendant of Levi, son of Jacob, and lived at a troubled time when there were many false prophets spreading false messages. =Daniel= Gustave Dore's engraving Daniel In The Lion's Den Danyal (Arabic: ÿØÿßŸÜŸäÿßŸÑ), known as Daniel in the Bible, is traditionally considered by Ibn Kathirs to be a prophet, alongside the other major prophets of the Old Testament, namely Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Although he is not mentioned in the Qur'an, there are a few Hadith which bear his name and which refer to his time spent in the den of the lions. There are debates, however, that go on about Daniel's time of preaching and some Muslims believe that he was not a prophet but a saintly man. Story of Daniel It was he who preached in Babylonian 'Iraq, exhorting the people to return to God. He lived during the reign of Cyrus, and taught this prince the unity of God and the true religion. al-Tabari says (\\"Chronique,\\" French translation of Zotenberg, i. 44) that thousands of people who had died in a certain town from an epidemic were resuscitated a thousand years later by the prayer of Daniel.Chronigue (French transl. by Zotenberg), i. 44, 496, 503, 571, ii. 283; When Daniel had become a noted prophet, Cyrus made him the chief of all his kingdom in order that he might teach his people the true religion. Daniel asked the king to let him go back to Palestine and re-build the Temple. Cyrus consented to the reconstruction of the sanctuary, but refused to let him go, saying, \\"If I had a thousand prophets like thee, I should have them all stay with me.\\" There is another tradition, to the effect that Daniel was king of the Israelites after their return from captivity.

It took place on 6 February 1864 between Sankelmark and Oeversee, on the road between Schleswig and Flensburg, during the Danish retreat from Dannevirke. Background The Danish army, under General Christian Julius De Meza had taken up position at the defenses of Dannevirke and had managed to hold the Prussians at bay at the Battle of Mysunde on the 2 February. However, two days later, the Prussians managed to cross the Schlei, threatening the Danes with encirclement. With the lack of heavy artillery and judging that the Dannevirke defenses were insufficient for a successful defense, De Meza decided the position was untenable and ordered a withdrawal to preserve the army intact and prevent encirclement. The withdrawal of the Danish Army to Dybb√∏l began on the 4 February. The Danish troops withdrew through the freezing weather. Austrian troops were dispatched in pursuit and in response, the 7th Brigade of the Danish army was ordered to stop the Austrians. Austrian troops reached the Danish rearguard near Sankelmark in the afternoon of the 6 February. Battle The Danish 7th Brigade consisting of the 1st Regiment, made up of soldiers from Copenhagen and the 11th Regiment, made up of soldiers from Vendsyssel was commanded by Colonel Max M√ºller and had taken up positions on both sides of the road. Around 3:30pm, the battle commenced when Colonel Max M√ºller ordered the 1st Regiment to attack. The Danish troops launched a fierce bayonet charge and despite the numerical advantage of the Austrian troops, the Danish troops managed to halt the Austrians. Fierce fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, followed and lasted for hours without either side gaining the decisive upper hand, until an Austrian bayonet charge finally forced the Danes to retreat. The battle ended around 5:00pm, when the sun began to set. The 7th Brigade then withdrew and linked up with the rest of the Danish army. However, they came under Austrian artillery fire and suffered considerable losses. According to the Danes, 210 Danes and 406 Austrians were killed or wounded during the battle. According to the Austrians, however, the Danes lost 962 men and the Austrians only 431. Aftermath The fighting at Sankelmark With this successful rearguard action by the 7th Brigade, the Danish army reached the safety of the redoubts at Dybb√∏l. Despite heavy losses, the Danish soldiers had performed well and the Austrian pursuers were halted. The successful withdrawal of the Danish army was, however, met with anger and disbelief from the Danish public and politicians. Following the victory in the First Schleswig War, a sense of military superiority had spread in Denmark and Danevirke, considered the historical border between Denmark and the German states, was considered a sacred national symbol and a formidable defensive line. In reality the defences of Dannevirke were simply not sufficient for a successful defence. Unfortunately, only the army recognised this, while politicians and the public demanded a defence of this national symbol. Few considered and acknowledged that De Meza had actually saved the army from eventual certain destruction by withdrawing and that the army had successfully withdrawn without significant casualties. De Meza was eventually sacked by the Minister of War and the Danish army lost one of its most capable and resourceful officers at a critical stage of the war. The perceived loss of face also meant that a later withdrawal from defences at Dybb√∏l was almost impossible due to public and political pressure. This became a factor in the later Danish defeat at the Battle of Dybb√∏l.  Literature  * J. Ganschow, O. Haselhorst, M. Ohnezeit: Der Deutsch-D√§nische Krieg 1864. Vorgeschichte - Verlauf - Folgen.

During the Second War of Schleswig, the fortifications of Danevirke were evacuated by the Danish army in 1864. This marked the last military use of the ancient defence structure of Danevirke, which has remained in German possession ever since. Background Due to emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark had expected the coming battle to take place at the Danevirke. The fortifications were already under attack, but no battle took place there, except some early skirmishing in close proximity just south of it, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew his forces to the trenches at Dybb√∏l. General De Meza feared being outflanked, as the Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum had frozen solid in a hard winter, and because the territory immediately in front of the Danevirke had already fallen into German hands. Actions This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never properly used for the evacuation. Aftermath News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General de Meza was promptly relieved of his command.

Forsyth was born at Elgin, Scotland, on 18 February 1763, and was the son, by his second marriage, of Alexander Forsyth, merchant in Elgin, a man of intelligence and piety, and a friend of Isaac Watts. His mother, Ann Harrold, was the daughter of a farmer who fought for Prince Charles at Battle of Culloden, was taken prisoner, and died on board ship while being carried for trial to England. From the grammar school of his native town Forsyth passed at the age of twelve to King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated M.A. in 1779. His parents intended him for the church, but his diffidence induced him to decline. He went to London and became assistant to the master of an academy at Newington Butts; was soon able to purchase the establishment, and carried it on successfully for thirteen years. Then, his health failing, he gave up the school and returned to Elgin. He had now the leisure and the means to give effect to what had been the great desire of his life, a visit to Italy. The Peace of Amiens was known in Elgin on 7 October 1801. On the 12th Forsyth was already on his way south, and on Christmas Day he arrived at Nice. The next eighteen months he spent in the more famous cities of Italy, where he had access to the literary circles, and saw everything with the eyes of a man well read in the poets and historians of the country, both ancient and modern, a connoisseur in architecture and a keen observer of thought and life. He was at Turin on his way home when the war was renewed, and on 25 May 1803 he was seized by the police and carried prisoner to Nismes, France. The restraint there was not severe, but Forsyth was caught in an attempt to escape, and was thereupon marched in midwinter six hundred miles to Fort de Bitch√©, where his confinement was at first intolerably strict. It was, however, gradually relaxed; after two years he was removed to Verdun, where he remained five years. Through the influence of a lady in the suite of the king of Holland he was in 1811 permitted to reside in Paris; but four months after the English in the capital were ordered back to their places of detention, and the utmost relaxation Forsyth's literary friends could obtain for him was the permission to go to Valenciennes instead of to Verdun. Forsyth had solaced his captivity by further study of Italian literature and art. Napoleon at that time affected the part of a patron of both; and Forsyth was induced by the hope of obtaining his release to appear in the character of an author. His ‚ÄòRemarks on Antiquities, Arts, and Letters, during an Excursion in Italy in the years 1802 and 1803,‚Äô were published in London in 1813, and copies were forwarded to Paris with many solicitations in his favour; but the effort failed, and it was not till the allies entered Paris in March 1814 that he regained his liberty. After a year in London he returned to Elgin, intending to settle there; but his constitution, never robust, had been undermined by his thirteen years of exile. He died on 20 September 1815, and was buried in his parents' tomb in the Elgin Cathedral churchyard, where his epitaph may still be read. A second edition of his ‚ÄòItaly‚Äô appeared in 1816, with a memoir of the author by his brother Isaac, who survived till 1859, and it has gone through several later editions, one (1820) issued at Geneva. Forsyth himself says in his ‚Äòadvertisement‚Äô that when he went to Italy he had no intention of writing a book. He wrote nothing else, and his brother informs us that he never to his dying day ceased to regret the publication; but the work, notwithstanding its limits, has proved of permanent value, and both for style and matter it is still one of the best books on Italy in our language.

Robert Forsyth (1766‚Äì1845), was a Scottish writer, best known for his five-volume work, The Beauties of Scotland. Early life Forsyth was born in Biggar, Lanarkshire, on 18 January 1766, the son of Robert Forsyth, a gravedigger, and Marion Pairman. His parents were poor, but gave him a good education, with a view to making him a minister. Forsyth entered Glasgow College at the age of fourteen, and obtained a license as a probationer of the Church of Scotland (a candidate for minister, serving a required probationary period). Careers Forsyth gained considerable popularity as a probationer, but with no influence, he grew tired of waiting for a parish. He tried to start a career in law, but met with resistance, possibly due to his humble origins. The fact that he was a licentiate of the Church was held as an objection to his being admitted to the bar. Refused by the Faculty of Advocates, he petitioned the court of session for redress. The court ruled that to be admitted to the bar, Forsyth would have to resign his office of licentiate, but after he did so the Faculty continued to refuse his admission. In 1792, Forsyth finally won admission as an advocate, after a judgment of Lord-President Campbell persuaded the Faculty to give way. However, he was unable to succeed in law; having fraternised with the \\"friends of the people\\", he was looked upon with suspicion as a \\"revolutionist\\". With few prospects in the legal profession, Forsyth turned next to literature, and managed to make a living by writing for booksellers. He contributed to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from 1802 to 1803, including the \\"Agriculture\\", \\"Asia\\", and \\"Britain\\" articles. He also tried poetry, politics, and philosophy, but with little success. Finally he was able to obtain a fair practice at the bar, where his self-described \\"great fits of application\\" earned him some success. Written works Reflecting his varied professional experiences, Forsyth's chief works include Principles and Practice of Agriculture (2 vols. 1804), The Principles of Moral Science (vol. i. 1805), Political Fragments (1830), and Observations on the Book of Genesis (1846). However, his best-known work is The Beauties of Scotland (5 vols. 1805‚Äì8), which still maintains some popularity today, due in part to the many engravings which it contains of Scottish towns and places of interest. At age seventy-six, Forsyth ‚Äì reflecting his continuing loyalty to the Church ‚Äì published a pamphlet entitled Remarks on the Church of Scotland, &c; (1843). This work was reviewed critically by Hugh Miller, then editor of the Witness, who ridiculed Forsyth's remarks in the pamphlet as well as some of his past speculations on philosophy (several of which bear similarities to commonly accepted current views). For example, Forsyth once noted: \\"Whatever has no tendency to improvement will gradually pass away and disappear for ever\\", hinting at the now-commonplace concept of the survival of the fittest. In addition, Forsyth wrote: \\"Let it never be forgotten then for whom immortality is reserved. It is appointed as the portion of those who are worthy of it, and they shall enjoy it as a natural consequence of their worth.\\" This view seems to parallel the doctrine of conditional immortality now held by many Christians. At the time, however, Hugh Miller said ironically of these views: \\"It was reserved for this man of high philosophic intellect to discover, early in the present century, that, though there are some souls that live for ever, the great bulk of souls are as mortal as the bodies to which they are united, and perish immediately after, like the souls of brutes.\\" Forsyth died in Edinburgh on 30 September 1845.

Graduating B.A. in 1728/9 and M.A. in 1732, he became a fellow of Sidney Sussex in 1730, and was Lady Margaret preacher to the university from 1744 to 1752. In 1751 Garnett went to Ireland as chaplain to the Lord Lieutenant, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. In 1752 he became Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin; he was translated to Clogher in 1758, and remained bishop of Clogher until his death. In 1765 he was touted as a possible successor to William Carmichael as Archbishop of Dublin, though the Irishman Arthur Smyth was ultimately appointed.William Henry to Thomas Secker, 12 December 1765.

There is a mural tablet to his memory in the chancel of St Lawrence's Church, Sigglesthorne,Thomas Moule, The English counties delineated, Vol. 2, 1837, p.420 and a painting of him in St John's College, Cambridge. Garnett married Dorothea, the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet.'Sir Thomas Molyneux, Bart.', Dublin University Magazine, vol. 18 (1841), p.763 According to the DNB, the John Garnett who was appointed dean of Exeter in February 1810, and died 11 March 1813, in his sixty-fifth year, was the Bishop's son.Here ODNB follows DNB. According to Venn, however, the Dean of Exeter was the son of a cook from Fetter Lane in London. See also Notes and Queries, Vol. 170 (1936), p.1081 Reputation Garnett was a patron of the clergyman Philip Skelton: according to Skelton's biographer Samuel Burdy, Skelton \\"would have continued in a wild part of the country all his days had not Providence placed Dr. Garnett in the see of Clogher, who was remarkable for promoting men distinguished for literary qualifications.\\" Elsewhere Burdy praised Garnett as \\"a pious, humble, good- natured man, a generous encourager of literature, kind to his domestics, and justly esteemed by all those who had an opportunity of knowing his virtues\\".ODNB, citing The complete works of the late Rev. Philip Skelton, to which is prefixed Burdy's life of the author, ed. Robert Lynam, 6 vols. (1824). The DNB attributed Burdy's remarks to Lynam. Thomas Campbell corroborated this account in his Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland (1777). Works The only work of Garnett, besides some occasional sermons, was his prolix Dissertation on the Book of Job (1749; second edition 1752). On seeing it at the Duke of Newcastle's, to whom it was dedicated, Lord Morton remarked that it was 'a very proper book for the ante-chamber of a prime minister.' Garnett's theory, by which the book of Job is referred to the period of the Babylonian captivity, and Job regarded as the type of the oppressed nation of Israel, was original for an eighteenth-century divine.

He made one appearance in the Football League for Nelson, but played the majority of his career in non- league football He has also played over 50 times for Barnoldswick and more than 30 times for Trawden as well as starting 100 games for his clubs. Barnoldswick Town Gartside was born in Nelson but played for rivals Barnoldswick Town. He made his debut and scored four in a 12-1 thumping of Halifax Town, which is only their second most heaviest defeat. They then faced Nelson and Gartside scored 5 in a 7-0 trashing. Barnoldswick went on to be promoted to the West Lancashire League. Gartside finished top scorer in the league, scoring 19 in the 24/25 season. Barnoldswick were promoted to the National League North and stayed there. Gartside once again got top scorer with 15 goals. However, in 1927, he broke his leg and fractured his kneecap. This ruled him out for 6 months but he made his return against Northampton in a 3‚Äì1 win. He made a 50th start against Plymouth Argyle where they won 5‚Äì3 with Gartside netting another hattrick, his 10th. He made three more appearances and finished the season with 11 goals. Trawden and Nelson loan Gartside chose to give himself a challenge and signed up for non-league football side Trawden. He made his debut against Colne, scoring 5 in a 7‚Äì3 win. From there on his season thrived, with Gartside grabbing three hattricks in three consecutive matches. He finished the season with 21 goals. Despite his brilliant form, Trawden decided they weren't \\"worthy enough for him\\" and loaned him to Nelson. However, he was outnumbered by better strikers and only made one start in the Football League. After the unsuccessful loan spell, Trawden sold him to Clitheroe. Later life and death Between 1929 and 1933 we don't know much about Gartside. He played for Clitheroe for one season, before he was loaned out to Bacup Borough, where he made another 8 appearances for the club, totalling 100 apps for all the clubs he played for. He scored a hattrick on his second game with the club when they won against Trafford 6-2 and a goal against Charnock Richard as the team won 5‚Äì1, reaching the 70 goal mark. He came back to Clitheroe for another season, but he was outruled by younger players. He went to Nelson and soon after a season there, he retired at 27. Gartside bought a home in Nelson and lived there for the rest of his life. He died on 26 August 1970, aged 64.

The aim of the act is to facilitate the devolution of decision-making powers from central government control to individuals and communities. The measures affected by the Act include an increase in the number of elected mayors, referendums and the \\"Local authority‚Äôs general power of competence\\" (Part 1, chapter 1) which states \\"A local authority has power to do anything that individuals generally may do\\". The official summary of the act is: Although the act was envisaged as having the potential to bring about wide-scale decentralisation, there have been few significant examples of its implementation. Mayor of Hackney Jules Pipe criticised it, saying that it \\"does not challenge the deep-rooted centralisation in the UK\\". One notable outcome of the act has been the combined authorities formed by local authorities pooling their powers of transport and economy and gaining certain functions delegated from central government. As a result, there have been calls for legislation to bring about further devolution to the Core Cities Group, leading to the introduction of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016. Timetable The bill was introduced by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, and given its first reading on 13 December 2010. The Bill completed the third reading in the House of Lords on 31 October 2011. The bill received Royal Assent on 15 November 2011. The main section of the Act is split into ten parts (totalling 240 pages), and this is followed by 25 further schedules (additional 243 pages). A short summary of the main points is available. Sections of the Act involving new regulations are straightforward but the Act also includes many detailed modifications of existing Acts, such as the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Planning Act 2008. =Part 1: Local Government= This is the major part of the Act, and the one which extends the power of all local authorities, from parish and community councils to county councils, to 'do anything that individuals generally may do', as long as that is not limited by some other Act. Sections 27 to 36 deal with the standards expected of council members and with the keeping of public registers of interests. In an important change, it specifically empowers members to take part in a decision on a matter after previously having expressed views on it, without the risk the decision being invalid due to bias or predetermination. =Parts 2 and 3: EU Financial Sanctions= These sections give ministers the right to require public authorities to pay fines to the European Union resulting from an infraction of European Union law. =Part 4: Non-domestic Rates= This appears to consist primarily of technical changes to the rating of business properties. =Part 5: Community Empowerment= This section is concerned with council tax and requires local authorities, fire authorities, and police and crime commissioners to conduct a local referendum if they wish to implement a council tax increase that is considered \\"excessive\\" according to a set of principles defined by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This section also creates new rights for charitable trusts, voluntary bodies and others to apply to councils to carry out services provided by the council, and allows lists to be compiled of Assets of Community Value such as shops, pubs and playing fields, which are privately owned, but which are of value to the community; if such assets are later sold, the Act makes it easier for local communities to bid for and take over the assets. =Part 6: Planning= Regional Strategies are abolished but there is a duty for interested parties to co-operate in the preparation of development plans. The Community Infrastructure Levy now includes the additional costs, besides infrastructure costs, that development places on an area and the money raised can be used to fund the improvement, replacement, operation or maintenance of infrastructure as well as its provision. The Act allows neighborhood plans to be developed but to be adopted they have to pass both an inspection stage and a local referendum. Suitable community organizations can obtain the rights to develop an area. The Act specifies how planning decisions can be legally enforced and allows planning authorities to decline to process planning applications which include any region affected by a planning enforcement notice. Nationally the Infrastructure Planning Commission is abolished and new powers put in place to cover national infrastructure projects. =Part 7: Housing= Each English housing authority must have an \\"allocation scheme\\" for determining priorities. Reasonable preference should be given to groups such as the homeless and those living in unsanitary conditions but otherwise housing authorities may themselves decide whom to support and the conditions of support. People subject to immigration control cannot be supported. The authorities' duty to homeless people, who are not intentionally homeless, now ceases if they refuse reasonable accommodation. The housing authorities must publish a \\"tenancy strategy\\" giving the types of tenancy provided, the circumstances under which they are granted, their length and the circumstances in which they may be extended. This section also includes many changes to tenancy law, to the financing of local authority housing and to the handling of complaints. Home Information Packs, which were required when selling a property, are abolished. =Part 8: London= This section is concerned with changes to the Acts and regulations which affect the Greater London Authority. It abolishes the London Development Agency to be replaced by a subsidiary corporation (GLA Land and Property) and requires the Mayor of London to prepare and publish an \\"Economic development strategy for London‚Äù and \\"The London Environment Strategy\\". The section also allows the Mayor of London to create \\"Mayoral development corporations\\" whose object is to regenerate parts of London identified as \\"Mayoral development areas\\". =Part 9: Compensation for Compulsory Acquisition= This is concerned with changes to the \\"Land Compensation Act 1961\\" which mean that existing planning permissions can be taken into account when compensation is being assessed. =Part 10: General= This section is concerned with administrative details, such as the date at which each section of the Act starts operating, how consultations should be carried out and the powers needed to make and amend the orders and regulations required by the Act. First prosecution under the Act The first prosecution to take place under the Act was thought to be against Spencer Flower, former leader of Dorset County Council and also an East Dorset District Councillor, whose trial took place at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court (then in Stafford Road) on 30 March 2015.\\"Former county council leader Spencer Flower first to be prosecuted under the Localism Act\\", Bournemouth Daily Echo, 30 March 2015. Retrieved 3 November 2019. The charge was that on 25 February 2013, Flower had voted in a council meeting on East Dorset's core strategy despite having a pecuniary interest in Synergy Housing Limited, which owned allotment land in Wimborne that was being considered for change of status under the said strategy. District Judge Nicholls found that Flower had a positive duty under Section 31(4) of the Act not to have participated in that meeting, nor to have voted.\\"Councillor first to be convicted of Localism Act pecuniary interest offence\\", Local Government Lawyer, 1 April 2015. Retrieved 3 November 2019. Flower was given a six-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay ¬£930 in costs. Further areas of influence =Cornwall= It was suggested that the Localism Bill could form a stepping stone to a devolved Cornish Assembly. Greg Clark, the minister responsible for the Bill, had indicated that this would be possible. In November 2010, British Prime Minister David Cameron said that his government would \\"devolve a lot of power to Cornwall - that will go to the Cornish unitary authority.\\" Talks took place in 2011 between the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and a cross party group, including the six Cornish MPs, as to how to bring about the devolution of powers to Cornwall. No progress was made, resulting in Mebyon Kernow relaunching its campaign for a Cornish Assembly in 2014. =Greater Manchester= In November 2011, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority used the Localism Act 2011 to seek provision for a further transfer of powers that would result in an additional devolution of authority from the UK's central government, enhancing its powers over transport and housing and granting it competencies to fund and control schemes on its own terms. However, further devolution required primary legislation and this was announced in November 2014.

The building was designed by the firm Bell, McCulloch, Spotowski and Associates.https://www.emporis.com/buildings/1261088/provincial-courthouse-of- alberta-edmonton-canada  History  During Edmonton's years as a frontier settlement, and later as a booming railway hub, in the North-Western Territory, Edmonton's courts lacked a purpose-built courthouse and relied on rented space. Edmonton was repeatedly passed over while purpose-built courthouses were constructed in much smaller, younger settlements. This finally changed when Edmonton became the capital of the new province of Alberta. In 1908, construction began on new Beaux-Arts/Greek revival courthouse, on what is now the west side of Churchill Square, to the southwest of the current Law Courts where the Edmonton City Centre mall now stands. It was completed in 1912 and demolished in 1972.  Services  As of April 2012, Edmonton's automated traffic ticketing is operated by City of Edmonton's Office of Traffic Safety, overseen by The Edmonton Police Service as per the Provincial Automated Enforcement Technology Guidelines.

Specifically, biological pollution is the introduction of non-indigenous and invasive species. Biopollution may cause adverse effects at several levels of biological organization: * an individual organism (internal pollution by parasites or pathogens), * a population (by genetic change, i.e. hybridization of IAS with a native species), * a community or biocoenosis (by structural shifts, i.e. dominance of IAS, replacement or elimination of native species), * a habitat (by modification of physical-chemical conditions), * an ecosystem (by alteration of energy and organic material flow). Biopollution may also cause decline in naturalness of nature conservation areas, adverse economic consequences and impacts on human health. The notion of \\"biological pollution\\" and \\"biological pollutants\\" described by Elliott (2003)Elliott, M. (2003) Biological pollutants and biological pollution - an increasing cause for concern. Marine Pollution Bulletin 46, 275-280 is generally accepted in invasion biology; it was used to develop the concept of biopollution level assessment (Olenin et al., 2007Olenin S, Minchin D, Daunys D (2007). Assessment of biopollution in aquatic ecosystems. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 55 (7-9), 2007, 379-394) and criteria for a Good Ecological Status descriptor in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (Olenin et al., 2010)Olenin S., Alemany F., A. Cardoso C., Gollasch S., Goulletquer P., Lehtiniemi M., McCollin T., Minchin D., Miossec L., Occhipinti Ambrogi A., Ojaveer H., Jensen K.R., Stankiewicz M., Wallentinus I. & Aleksandrov B. (2010). Marine Strategy Framework Directive - Task Group 2 Report. Non- indigenous species. EUR 24342 EN. DOI 10.2788/87092. Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. 44 pp. The magnitude of the bioinvasion impact or biopollution level (Olenin et al., 2007) may be quantified using a free online service BINPAS. In 1991 The Indiana Academy of Science held a national cross disciplinary conference in Indianapolis (McKnight 1993), the first of its find dealing with the issue.  Biopollution level  \\"Biopollution Level (BPL)\\" is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the biological invasion impact, ranging from \\"no impact\\" (BPL=0) through \\"weak\\" (BPL=1), \\"moderate\\" (BPL=2), \\"strong\\" (BPL=3) and \\"massive\\" (BPL=4) impact. Initially the method of calculation involves assessing the abundance and distribution range of a non-indigenous species (NIS) for a specific area (this can be, for example, an entire regional sea, bay, inlet, lagoon, pond, lake, marina, a sand bank, an aquaculture site etc.). Abundance of a NIS may be ranked as \\"low\\", \\"moderate\\" or \\"high\\"; and the distribution may be scored as \\"one locality\\" (when a NIS was found only at one locality within the assessment area), \\"several localities\\", \\"many localities\\" or \\"all localities\\" (found at all localities). Combination of the abundance and distribution scores gives five classes of the abundance and distribution range. Once obtained this value aids in calculating an impact on 1) native communities, 2) habitats and, 3) ecosystem functioning. The calculation is based on ecological concepts, e.g. \\"key species\\", \\"type specific communities\\", \\"habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss\\", \\"functional groups\\", \\"food web shift\\", etc. Calculations are for a stated time period to enable assessment of temporal changes. The method can be used for a single species or for several species for a specific (assessment) area. The method was designed for species in aquatic ecosystems (Olenin et al., 2007) but is currently being tested for terrestrial environments and there is a free on-line service BINPAS. The biopollution level enables quantification of an impact in a robust manner in a standard and repeatable way. It makes it possible for comparison between different regions and taxonomic groups at different time intervals. The most impacting biota can be readily distinguished for a given region. It does not evaluate whether an impact effect is either good or bad, it states the change in an ecosystem due to an alien species invasion and measures the magnitude of this change. However, the method requires adequate information in order to obtain the magnitude of the impact, assessed at three levels of confidence (low, medium and high) according to the quality of the data available. The method is simple to undertake and provide a means of quantifying impacts within any world region. Some assessments have been published (Olenina et al., 2010).Olenina, I., Wasmund, N., Hajdu, S., Jurgensone, I., Gromisz, S., Kownacka, J., Toming, K., Vaiciute, D., Olenin, S. 2010.

BINPAS translates the existing data on miscellaneous invasive alien species impacts on population, community, habitat or ecosystem into uniform biopollution measurement units. The service is free of charge and available at for anyone interested in biological invasions.

Early life  Mediavilla y Azcona was born in the early eighteenth century. In 1727, he was appointed Captain of the Presidio of Bexar and acting governor of Texas, replacing the Governor Fernando P√©rez de Almaz√°n.MEDIAVILLA Y AZCONA, MELCHOR DE  The Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved 21 December 2010, to 12:45 pm. Under his administration, Mediavilla y Azcona promoted several foundations by Friars between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers. On March 5, 1731 three missions were renamed in San Antonio: Nuestra Se√±ora de la Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n de los Hainai changed its name to Nuestra Se√±ora de la Purisima Concepci√≥n de Acu√±a, San Francisco de los Neches was renamed San Francisco de la Espada, while San Jose de los Nazones was renamed San Juan Capistrano. While Mediavilla y Azcona was governor, Inspector Pedro de Rivera y Villal√≥n revised political management of Mediavilla and found errors in his administration. Villal√≥n recommended to Mediavilla y Azcona to hire more officials. He also indicated that Presidio de Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores should be removed and the number of people who formed the garrison of Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar should be reduced to 60 men. These recommendations were implemented. According to Historian Juan Augustine Morfi, Mediavilla left the government of Texas after his fight with the Viceroy, because he had rejected the recommended reforms. He ruled the province until 1731, when the Viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acu√±a, marqu√©s de Casafuerte appointed a new governor, Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos. Mediavilla never was confirmed in his position as governor. When Canarian settlers came to San Antonio on 9 March 1731, Mediavilla was still in charge of the province of Texas, but it was Juan Antonio Perez de Almazan, captain of the local prison, who welcomed them and given them accommodation in the best houses of the soldiers.

The comic book followed the adventure of superhero, Cole MacGrath, and takes place in between the events of Infamous and Infamous 2. The comic primarily depicts Cole's escape from Empire City in the first game to New Marais in the second game. The comic features illustrations by Eric Nguyen as well as a cover art by Doug Mahnke with the story written by William Harms. The first issue of the six-part comic series was released in March 2011. Story =Issue #1= In the first issue, it is revealed that Moya was working with Kessler on the last stages of the Ray Sphere's Development and also helped fund his research. While working at an old First Sons research facility in the Neon district, Kessler reveals to Moya one of his test subjects, David, who had been exposed to the Ray Sphere eleven times. He explains to her that each exposure to the Ray Sphere \\"unlocks a new ability\\" within a conduit. In the present, the government is still covering up the situation in Empire City while over in the Historic District, Cole is mourning by Trish's grave until he is eventually confronted and consoled by Warden Harms. The two then make plans to flush out the rest of the First Sons by Pier 12. Meanwhile, over by the Steel Harbour, Moya has gathered several volunteer test subjects with one of them, Lieutenant Poole, being replaced by a mysterious man because of a \\"blood abnormality.\\" Moya also has Alden Tate in custody and has her team of surgeons to sedate and perform a biopsy on him. Later that night, tension builds between Cole and Zeke as Cole tells him the truth about Kessler; that he is Cole from the future who came back in time to set up the Ray Sphere, Cole's powers, the quarantine and even Trish's death. All so that Cole would be powerful enough to face the Beast. During that same night, David has escaped his containment from the First Sons' research facility and seeks refuge at his home in North Beach, in the Neon, only to find his wife dead from a drug overdose. Enraged, David begins to seek revenge on Cole, who he believes is Kessler in disguise. =Issue #2= With the Quarantine in its 25th day, Moya continues planning the invasion of Empire City and the capturing of Cole MacGrath. As Alden is already in custody, Moya moves to the next phase of her plan: capturing Sasha. She explains that Sasha likes Cole and that they can't move against him until she is in custody. Sasha is eventually captured by Moya's troops and is taken to the Steel Harbour, where her mind control tar is extracted with the intention of using it to capture Cole. Meanwhile, over in the Warren, Cole is having an identity crisis and confides with Zeke, despite their past issues. Cole feels as though he has lost everything that's made him who he is because of Kessler. Zeke reveals to Cole that after he took off with Kessler and the Ray Sphere, he was just locked in a room with \\"a bed, TV and piss bucket\\". He goes on to say that Kessler would sometimes stumble in \\"drunk off his ass\\" only to leave after an hour or so. Then one day he comes in and tells Zeke goodbye and thanks him for being such a good friend. Zeke, not understanding the significance of this at the time, finally understood what Kessler was talking about. He tells Cole that at the end of the day, Kessler was just \\"some guy\\" and that just because he changed Cole's future, doesn't mean he controls Cole. In that moment of consolation, there is a sudden missile attack and military troops invade the city. Cole tells Zeke to alert Warden Harms before he engages in a fierce battle. In the Neon, troops are flooding the streets and in David's home he has placed the bodies of his wife and daughter on a bed respectfully with crucifixes and lit candles all around the room. He recalls flashbacks of his normal self playing with his daughter. Suddenly troops gather outside his house only to die by his hands. David continues his search to find Cole while killing more Blast survivors (situated in the sewers) in the process. The media continues their cover up by saying that Military troops are demolishing weak structures of the city to prevent them from collapsing and injuring anyone. They also say that they are relocating citizens into security camps when in reality they are actually killing people. In the meantime, Moya contacts Cole through his cell phone and explains that she sent those troops to lock down the rest of the city and to show him how serious she was. She then goes on to say Cole has until tomorrow morning \\"then the gloves come off\\". =Issue #3= In issue #3, a flash back to day of the blast, Kessler teleported to Cole's location and made sure he is fine, then he hopes that Cole can forgive him for what he's done. In the present Cole is in the police station wondering if he should give himself to Moya or not, at the same time David attacks the station and kills some policemen and nearly kills Zeke until Cole comes to the rescue. Moya is informed of what is happening and redeploys the soldiers to stop David from killing Cole. David, who believes Cole to be Kessler, starts beating him without mercy. Moya wanted to use two of who's in the stasis to be in the field to stop David, but the doctor tells her that is impossible and they are not ready. Moya responded by saying she wasn't asking, but the doctor tells her if they are out of the stasis they will die before they take one step. Moya tells him if Cole dies it will be his ass. In the field, as the soldiers are being killed by David, Cole tries to take the fight to another place. At first the plan works but David quickly catches up with Cole and slams him into a building. Moya contacts Cole and tells him to get out of the building before it is bombed. Cole manages to get out, but David is caught in the explosion and buried under the wreckage. Cole returns to the police station and tells them he can't stay because the \\"thing\\" was after him and he needs Zeke's apartment keys because he needs a place to sleep. Zeke argues with Cole. Cole tells him he was saved by Moya but he can still can hear it (David) down there scraping around, trying to escape and if it wants to kill him so bad then it can kill him alone so that no one else will get hurt. In the Steel Harbor Moya tells the general about David and tells him that he was blasted with the Ray Sphere over thirty times but there was a significant flaw that didn't reveal itself until it was too late. The flaw is revealed to be that David consumes neuroelectricity and without it he will die, but he can store enough for a few weeks. The doctor asks them what if David escaped the city or killed Cole, as without Cole they can't replicate the effect of the Ray Sphere. Moya tells them that one of David's powers is to \\"smell\\" people on the genetic level and he is after Cole because he wants revenge for what Kessler did to him. The general reveals that they already know Kessler and Cole are the same person but asks if David knows that. Moya answers with more or less, for David they are the same person and he will not stop until Cole is dead. They decide to get Cole as far away from Empire City as possible and since every attempt to capture him failed, they will change their method and will \\"attack his heart\\" to capture him. The issue ends with Cole in Zeke's apartment looking at pictures of Trish and the picture which he took from Kessler whilst he cries. =Issue #4= In issue #4, a flash back show Moya trying to arrest Kessler, but Kessler kills the soldiers Moya brought along. Moya then asks Kessler what he is, Kessler tells her she doesn't want to know and that the Ray Sphere is with NSA Agent John White. Moya tells Kessler she will deal with John later, and tells Kessler that he will not get out of the city alive. After she leaves, Kessler says to himself he \\"didn't plan to\\". Then Kessler takes a look at the picture of his wedding day and says \\"One short sleep past, we wake eternally, and death shall be no more, thou shalt die.\\" In the present Moya locates Cole, who is sleeping in Zeke's apartment. Cole has a dream involving Kessler showing him where he buried his wife and daughters. Kessler then tells him that The Beast is coming, and that it's ravenous, unstoppable. Kessler tells Cole that the road ahead is full of graves, and if he is going to do what needs to be done, he must ignore all the graves regardless of whose bones they hold. Cole wakes up, not sure how much he can stomach, with the military watching him. Zeke and Warden Harms are moving through the Jefferson tunnel, the warden asks Zeke what happened between them. Zeke tells the warden what happened and that he is not sure if Cole will ever forgive him. The warden tells Zeke before Cole forgive him he must forgive himself first. In the Neon District, David rises from the wreckage' still determined to kill Kessler/Cole before he \\"returns home to his wife and daughter as he promised\\". While Cole is in Zeke's apartment, a group of soldiers prepare to enter the apartment and throw a gas bomb. When Cole is exposed to the gas he starts to suffer hallucinations about Trish blaming him for her death. Sasha contacts him telepathically and tells him what he sees is not real and Moya is using her gift to confuse him. Sasha then tells him to get out of the apartment. He does so by jumping from the window, but the hallucinations don't go away. Zeke and the warden are outside the building the moment Cole jumped, as well as the soldiers who ignore the two and capture Cole. David watches as the soldiers fly away with Cole. Meanwhile, two reporters enter the city and finds one of the survivors who takes them to show them what is really going on. While Cole is being withheld and the doctors try to keep him awake, Sasha contacts him and tells him she's not going to let anything happen to him. She also tells him that Moya thinks she's beaten her, but she's wrong and she'll see her dead. When Cole's vitals stabilize, Moya says the two of them need to have a long talk. =Issue #5= In issue #5, a flashback into the past 4 months prior to the blast shows David's wife, calling his work for the fourth time. Kessler tells her that David turned down the job and stopped working for them a month ago, and that David wanted a fresh start, leaving all of this behind him. He also mentions that he was a very sad, broken man and had a drinking problem. Meanwhile, David is being blasted with the Ray Sphere. She tells Kessler that she knows who he is and warns him she is going to call the police. Kessler tells her that if it will make her feel better, she can call the police, but she should consider the fact that her husband simply left her. Before she could tell him that she was not going to let him get away with what he's done, Kessler hangs up. He tells another person to send someone to keep an eye on her and get in touch with their contact in the police to make sure they stay out of the facility. In the present, the two reporters follow one of the survivors to the sewers. She tells them she will show them what is really going on if they agree to take her and the corpse of her father out of the city. The reporters are initially reluctant, but she convinces them that their station will \\"move heaven and earth\\" to get a story of this magnitude. She then leads them to a makeshift underground hospital. At the Steel Harbor, Moya tries to persuade Cole to work for the military. When she sees that he will not do it willingly, she shows him a device and tells him that when they put it at the base of his skull he will do whatever they say, whether he wants to or not. At the Warren, Zeke, the Warden, and a group of policemen make their move to save Cole, while back at the Neon District in the sewers the reporter interviews the survivors. Back at the Steel Harbor, David arrives and can sense that Cole is there alone, cornered, and this time he can't escape him, At the same time Sasha frees herself, kills some guards and makes her way to Cole just in time to save him, while David is outside killing some soldiers. Zeke's group were seen by the soldiers, who started to shoot at them. David kills most of the soldiers before Moya is informed about Cole's escape. While he is making holes in the ship walls to escape, Moya tells the doctor to open all the stasis containers, but the doctor tells her they are still not ready. At same time, David catches Cole's smell. Cole jumps out of the ship and Moya argues with the doctor before holding him at gun point and telling him she wasn't asking. Sasha is shown killing some soldiers. Cole meets Zeke and the Warden outside. David sees Cole and heads straight for him. Cole tries to run but David catches up with him. The reporters come out from the sewers in time to see Cole at the mercy of David. Moya tells the ones who come out of stasis to make sure Cole is not to be harmed, and everyone else is expendable. Meanwhile, David is killing Cole, blaming him for the death of his wife and daughter. He says he can still hear the voice of his wife on the phone, crying, begging, desperate to find him and it was the last time he heard her voice; it's his last memory of her and it's all that he thinks about. Before he can kill Cole, he is stopped by 3 Military Conduits. Cole mocks David by telling him he thinks \\"David pissed off the wrong people.\\" =Issue #6= In the miniseries' finale, a flashback shows that a few days before the present, Cole is still recovering from the blast with Trish by his side. Zeke tells her that before she met him, Cole was hit by a truck. She mentions that Cole told her about it, but Zeke tells her that's what he tells everyone, to make it sound like it was no big deal; in reality, it should have killed him. The front of the truck hit him in the chest, whipped him around and rolled him under tires, running over both of his legs. A few days later, Cole walked away with only a few bruises. Zeke then reassures Trish that Cole will survive the ordeal. In the present, Sasha is trying to find Moya on the ship. Moya sneak attacks Sasha with a pipe and tells Sasha she should have left when she could and now she is going to kill her. Outside, the Military Conduits are fighting David. Cole is knocked out and Sasha retaliates against Moya. David kills one of the Military Conduits by absorbing his neuro-electricity. Zeke helps Cole to stand up and asks him \\"What are those things?\\". Cole answers that they are probably something Moya cooked up. Soldiers arrive to help Moya, while the reporters and the survivor make a run for it. While David is fighting the other Conduits he notices that they stink just like Moya and concludes that her guilt is thick as Kessler's. He then kills another Conduit by ripping him into two. Sasha escapes and Cole watches as David is killing the last Conduit. Cole remembers how he dropped out of college six credits short of graduation because he got pissed off by how a professor treated one of his friends. He walked away then and he's been walking away ever since, from his father, from jobs, from himself and decides that his days of walking away are over and goes to fight David. Cole cut one of David arms only to be hit and sent right into ship. After the general finds out what Moya did, he threatens to shut her operation down, only for Moya to kill him. David kills the last Military Conduit and goes after Cole to finish him. Moya tells the others that if anything happens to Cole, she is going to kill them herself. Meanwhile, Cole fights David and their fight cause a hole in the ship that David falls into. Moya goes after him and so does Cole. Their fight continues which is tearing the ship apart. Cole finds jet fuel and uses it to burn David. Moya arrives and Cole uses Lightning Storm to finish David off. While David is dying, he sees a vision of his family. He says he's sorry and ask them to forgive him. They tell him there is nothing to forgive and they love him before he dies. Moya tells Cole that with one phone call, there will be $30 million bounty on his head and even his own parents will sell him out. The ship starts to sink, and Moya gets trapped. Cole tries to help her but she tells him there is no time and he must go before the water kills him. Cole runs and Moya dies with the ship sinking. Two days later, the news shows the event of Military conduits and Cole fighting David that was provided by the reporters Phil Maabe and Linda Kaufman. It also shows how the sick and the injured are forced to live in the sewers, the sinking ship claimed 300 lives, Moya was working without the authorization from her superiors or the US Military, Cole is still at large and the CDC confirms that the quarantine will remain in place for the foreseeable future. At the Warren Zeke asks Cole if he thinks that \\"Monster- Thing\\" is dead for good. Cole says he really hopes so. While talking about the news, Cole is called by a woman named Lucy Kuo. She tells him she worked with John White in the NSA and that they need to talk. History The comic is based on a video game that was actually inspired by comic books, namely two DC Comics series, DMZ and Batman: No Man's Land. The series shares similarities in regards to the setting of the story, which is focused on a city after a large scale disaster. Like many comic books published in the 1990s, the series has a grim take on the superhero genre. Apart from influence from those comic series, the film Batman Begins which was based on the DC Comics super hero Batman was also an influence for the series.

With a distinctive pink colour and stepped shape, the building is in downtown Edmonton, where it towers over the neighbouring Edmonton Convention Centre and overlooks the North Saskatchewan River valley. The building was built by the Government of Canada and is the main federal government offices for Edmonton and much of Western Canada. The building opened in 1988 as a replacement for the Federal Public Building, which had been the main federal offices since 1958. Construction lasted from November, 1985 until the summer of 1988, and was worked on by WZMH Group Architects. The building consists of two stepped office blocks, ranging from 15 to 13 storeys in height, connected by an atrium. The total floor space is 85,800 m¬≤. The original design of the building had an additional, taller, third office block at the rear, however this plan was scaled back to two blocks after it was felt office occupancy levels in downtown Edmonton at the time were not low enough to justify the larger building. The pavilion was engineered to accommodate the third tower in the future, should it be desired. In 2006, the federal government hired BMO Capital Markets and RBC Capital Markets Real Estate Group Inc. to study whether continuing to own Canada Place made best fiscal sense. The firms concluded it was more prudent for the Crown to sell and leaseback the building to a private developer, along with eight other Crown-owned properties across Canada. All nine buildings were sold in 2007 to Larco Investments Ltd., a Vancouver, BC-based company, and leased for 25 years. The building is linked to the Edmonton Convention Centre and the Citadel Theatre via the Edmonton Pedway. There is a publicly open food court in the lower level of the building, as well as underground parking.

A Hollyoaks spokesperson said that the students are \\"possibly the coolest set\\" to ever feature in the serial because they \\"shake things up\\" and face \\"life's hardest lessons\\". Their fresher's week branded the \\"most fun and cringe-worthy\\" one ever. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly later announced Rob would depart the serial on 18 February 2013. Rob was initially billed as a \\"sporty jock\\", while E4.com have described him as having three passions: his girlfriend Annalise Appleton (Tamaryn Payne), \\"sport and partying\\". Rob is \\"sociable\\", likes \\"the blokey camaraderie of team sports\\" and \\"drunken banter\\". Through his social activities, Rob has gained a large number of \\"drinking buddies\\" and gained a \\"party boy reputation\\", though Annalise does not approve. Rob sees university as a chance to carry on partying. Atkins has said that Rob is \\"a bit of a jock\\" who loves going out with \\"the lads\\" to talk about rugby.

Atkins said they need to give each other more space, but living in the same halls \\"makes it difficult\\".

He also added that the situations that Rob gets into should be easy to relate to by any first-year student. Atkins later gave advice to the National Union of Students; he said that Rob \\"immediately signed up for the rugby team and spent most of his time in the SU bar.\\" Atkins added that Rob's technique is a great way for any student to be \\"involved with the University spirit\\".

The storyline was to highlight the danger of text messaging while driving, making light of the fact that doing so increases the risk of a car accident by \\"23 times\\". Hollyoaks partnered with the independent road safety charity Brake for the storyline, which helped launch \\"Road Safety Week\\". The charity's director, Julie Townsend, said that \\"too many young lives are lost and ruined through road crashes\\". They added that it was important for television programmes such as Hollyoaks to highlight \\"appalling consequences of crashes\\". While the Hollyoaks press office said \\"Ethan realises the enormity of his actions. He shouldn‚Äôt have been texting while driving and he knows he could very well lose his job.\\" On screen, the storyline plays out when Ethan is texting Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) and Liberty Savage (Abi Phillips) while driving.

Atherton told Alison Slade from TVTimes that tensions arise from how they both fare on the rugby team. He explained that Rob \\"has never really recovered\\" from his leg injury sustained as a result of being run over. Will continues to progress in the team, which sparks an \\"element of jealousy\\" from Rob, who feels as though Will has taken his place. Rob then flirts with Theresa; Atherton said that Rob breaks the \\"mates code\\" and \\"it all kicks off\\" leading to a scuffle. Rob then has sex with Will's sister Liberty, which causes more trouble. Will and Barney Harper-McBride (Tom Scurr) stage an intervention and tie Rob to a chair; Atherton added that is in order to \\"make him get in touch with his feelings, he admits how he really feels about Annalise, and realises that he's been an idiot.\\" Rob arrives at HCC with Annalise and meets his flatmates Barney, Will and Scott.

Daytona Lights Daytona Lights are a real world five piece indie band that are introduced to Hollyoaks, with all members playing partially fictional versions of themselves. The characters were billed as \\"cool characters who provide an authentic youth story and can rock out the SU Bar.\\" The band's arrival was announced in September 2011. The band consists of lead singer Danny Lawrence and fellow members Laurence Saywood, Louis Souyave, Matt Gill, Sam Fordham. Lawrence said his band's inclusion was a \\"great opportunity\\" for his band to promote their music out to a \\"mass audience\\" because \\"that's what every musician wants\\". He also said his bandmates were enjoying the lifestyle Hollyoaks had to offer. Three of the band's members met while studying at a drama school in Hackney. Prior to their involvement with the serial, Daytona Lights were signed to a Hubris Records, a small record label which is headed by Steve Levine. Levine wanted to find a platform to promote the band on. British actor Stephen Fry introduced Levine to the Audio Network, a music library which offers commercial television low price and license free music. At the same time one of Hollyoaks producers, Tony Wood was using the music from the library as he wanted the serial to gain a more \\"cool and indie\\" image. When Wood visited the band, he and Levine decided to work on joint venture to include the band in Hollyoaks for a promotional push on both parts. Wood also wanted to bring a real band into the serial as opposed to a fictional one. Wood said their inclusion shows another example of Hollyoaks having more layers than just storyline. As the serial features popular culture and has a specific target audience, Wood felt that Daytona Lights are characters that are \\"aspirational, fun and who they could relate to.\\" The band will be \\"softly\\" introduced during October and a slow build in storylines will progress. The members will debut onscreen separately and eventually form a band, Levine explained that \\"the concept is as you would have in real life where you come across a real band.\\" Daytona Lights will be seen rehearsing and perform sound checks, while the Hollyoaks students drink in the SU Bar. Over their duration, the band's music will be made available for download and some tracks given to viewers for free. Their story arc culminated during a \\"big\\" storyline airing during a New Year's Eve episode. While off-screen Daytona Lights planned to release their first studio album. In March 2012, it was announced thart Daytona Lights would return to the series. The band filmed scenes at the Blue Planet Aquarium in Cheshire. Rebecca Wade who works for the aquarium, told Laurie Stocks-Moore of the Ellesmere Port Pioneer that the band had filmed at a number of locations in the attraction, but said the storyline had to remain a secret. The regular characters of Dodger (Danny Mac), Liberty (Abi Phillips) and Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini) also took part in the scenes; which aired later in 2012. Laurence and Louis arrive in the village with Kelly Saunders (Danielle Malone), while she meets up with Duncan Button (Dean Aspen). Duncan thinks that Kelly is attracted to Laurence and Louis, unaware they are trying to pair Kelly off with Duncan. Danny and Sam arrive as friends of Ash Kane (Holly Weston) and perform at the S.U. Bar, while Matt turns up working as a bouncer at the venue. Sam meets Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) and they start dating. Louis and Laurence secure a spot singing in the SU Bar, after an argument Laurence refuses to join in. Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest) tries to sort out their differences and they perform as planned. When Louis snubs Leanne's advances, Michaela tries to set Leanne up with Danny so she can spend more time with Sam. He shows no interest in her so Michaela tries to set her up with Matt. She starts following Matt around thinking he likes her. Michaela asks Sam, Danny, Louis and Laurence if they can form a band. However, they are not impressed with Michaela's vocals. They remove Michaela from the band which makes her dump Sam. They invite Matt to join as their drummer and Sam reconciles with Michaela. Laurence and Louis move in with Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) and Ruby Button (Anna Shaffer) plants stolen money on them. They forgive her when she tells Frankie the truth. Michaela tells Sam that a scout is going to visit the band's performance at the SU Bar. They nearly mess their performance up after a technical fault and think that the scout did not show. Michaela uploads video footage of the performance and sends it to the scout. Louis reveals that they have been offered a developmental contract in London. The band then leave to start a new life in London. Michaela and Leanne go to Sheffield to film an online video of their tour. Leanne starts following Matt around again and he tells her to stop. Sam then tells Michaela that he is not interested in getting back with her. The gig is cancelled and Dennis finds them an alternative venue. Bobby Costello Bobby Costello, played by Jayden Fox, is the son of Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), who made his first appearance on 2 November 2011, the episode in which he was born. Mercedes went into labour in the basement of The Dog in the Pond public house because she was being held captive by Riley's grandfather Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), a serial killer who wanted revenge on Mercedes for betraying Riley by having an affair with Riley's father Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). After Riley was shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon) in an accidental struggle with Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) and Mercedes was arrested for stabbing herself and framing Riley's girlfriend Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton), Bobby was taken from the McQueens to live in California with Carl and his family, hoping he would have a better life without Mercedes. Bobby returns in 2018 after his mother Mercedes, who has spent the last year in America bonding with him, leaves him in the care of her cousin Cleo McQueen (Nadine Rose Mulkerrin). Bobby is happy to be reunited with his maternal family, especially his maternal grandmother, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane). Carl returns to take Bobby back, where it is revealed that Mitzeee and Mercedes agreed that Bobby should live away from Carl because he has developed alcoholism. Dennis Savage Dennis Savage, played by Joe Tracini arrives on-screen on 15 November 2011. Tracini's casting was first publicised in July 2011, when his father, comedian Joe Pasquale, told the Cornish Guardian of his involvement. Entertainment website Digital Spy later confirmed the casting and revealed that Dennis is a new member of the already established Savage family. Tracini revealed via his Twitter account that he began filming in August and also filmed a spot in the Hollyoaks opening titles. A spokesperson refused to release any advance storyline information about Dennis, but stated that Tracini has \\"great comic timing\\" for the role. Soap opera magazine Inside Soap later revealed Dennis' relation to the rest of the Savage family, as being a cousin of Liberty (Abi Phillips), Dodger (Danny Mac) and Will Savage (James Atherton). Dodger is not pleased to see his cousin and does not want him living in his caravan. Dodger convinces Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) and Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest) to let Dennis move in with them. Digital Spy said Dennis arrives being \\"confident and full of beans\\" and said he looks likely to \\"cause a stir\\". In January 2012, series producer Emma Smithwick told Inside Soap that Dennis would be leaving for a small period of time. Smithwick said that on his return, she see Dennis and his family \\"having a bigger place in Hollyoaks\\". She also revealed that she couldn't get enough of Tracini because of the \\"charisma and great comic timing\\" he brings to the role. Tracini told Inside Soap that Dennis temporary exit storyline begins when he receives an offer for a two-month work placement in India. As Dennis is \\"quite taken\\" with Leanne he decides to let her know in case she wants him to stay. Tracini said that Leanne has been \\"using\\" Dennis to make Matt jealous. Leanne is \\"forced to admit facts and Dennis doesn't take the revelation too well\\". Kate White from Inside Soap said that Dennis had \\"injected originality, laughs and much-needed kookiness back into the show\\". White said that she could not wait until Dennis was back on-screen making \\"his next move\\". For his portrayal of Dennis, Tracini earned a nomination for \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" at the 2012 British Soap Awards. Tracini was later nominated for \\"Funniest Male\\" at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. On 24 April 2014, it was announced that Tracini had quit the show. Dennis's departure aired on 21 November 2014. Dennis arrives to stay with his family as his parents have kicked him out. He meets Leanne and is instantly attracted to her, however she does not show any interest in him. Dodger tells Dennis he cannot live with them and convinces Texas to let him move into her flat. Dennis is delighted to discover that Leanne also lives there. Dennis becomes disgruntled when Leanne show more interest in Matt Gill, but still comforts her when Matt tells Leanne to keep her distance. Dennis waits for Leanne to return home from her Christmas break. When she returns he gives her intimate lingerie. Leanne feels uncomfortable because he knows what size underwear she takes. Dennis refuses to believe that Leanne does not want him. Dennis receives a job offer in Mumbai, Dodger tries to convince him to take the job regardless of Leanne. Dennis chooses not to listen, Dodger convinces Leanne to tell Dennis she is not interested. Texas and Leanne throw Dennis a leaving party and he goes to Mumbai. Upon his return Dennis reveals that could not go to Mumbai due to his fear of flying. He stayed in a bed and breakfast and lost his job, so Dodger hires him to work in the SU Bar. Dennis' old work friend Neesha (Kiran Landa) visits him and tells him that he is too good for bar work so he later resigns from his job. When Dennis goes on a date with Neesha, Leanne becomes jealous and warns Neesha her off Dennis. Neesha tells Dennis that she thinks he still has feelings for Leanne and leaves. He later helps out when his family host a tent party. When Will gets into trouble for fooling customers into thinking famous bands would be playing, Dennis goes on a road trip and convinces Maverick Sabre to perform. Dennis later becomes jealous when Leanne agrees to stage a sham wedding with Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) to hide his sexuality from his family. Dennis helps out with the arrangements but tells Doug's boyfriend Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) that he does not want it to go ahead. The wedding does not happen but Leanne is upset that she did not get a wedding. Dennis agrees to marry her, but the minister says it would not be legal. They exchange false vows and Leanne tells Dennis that she does not want a relationship with him again. Dennis and Blessing Chambers (Modupe Adeyeye) later move to Blackpool in November 2014. In August 2018 it was announced that Tracini will reprise his role as Dennis. The character will return for Dirk's funeral. On 15 August 2018 on the day Dennis returns, Liberty asks how Blessing is and he tells her they are not together anymore. Joel Dexter Joel Dexter, played by Andrew Still from 2011 to 2013 and by Rory Douglas-Speed from 2016 onwards, debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 22 November 2011. He is the long-lost son of established character Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Jodie Wilde Jodie Wilde, played by Montana Manning, arrived on-screen during the episode airing on 19 December 2011. A spokesperson for the serial said that \\"Jodie is ambitious to a fault - she'll allow nothing to stand in the way of her dreams to be a dancer. Let's hope she's not setting herself up for a fall.\\" In her early appearances she shared scenes with fellow characters Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) and Dodger Savage (Danny Mac). Manning said that Jodie is \\"different\\" to most females because she can \\"switch on and off\\", which makes her popular with men as she sets their \\"hearts racing\\". Jodie has a keen interest in performing arts; she views love as a \\"fool's game\\" and prefers to conform to a \\"treat em' mean and keep em' keen\\" attitude. Manning said that Jodie's attitude is strong enough to cause conflict with other female characters. Dodger's attraction to Jodie puts her in the firing line of the serial's jealous females. Initially describing her future hopes for the \\"likeable\\" Jodie, Manning stated; \\"I hope she has some gritty storylines, I think there is a lot behind her confidence and flirty eyes that she keeps hidden.\\" Manning, a former singer, said that she did not want to portray Jodie singing because she wanted to keep her acting and singing career separate. She added that she shares Jodie's \\"drive\\" because she too is \\" very ambitious\\". A columnist for Soaplife commented on Jodie's promiscuity. They opined that \\"lucky\\" Jodie had \\"barely been in Hollyoaks for five minutes\\" before she managed to get Dodger's \\"kit off\\". When Jodie kisses Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove), they jested that they were not sure who was more surprised out of Texas and Dodger. While a columnist for All About Soap also judged \\"sexy\\" Jodie's early appearances. They said that Jodie had managed to get all of \\"the men in Hollyoaks in a spin\\" and that \\"the girls can't seem to resist her ample charm either\\". They said she has no class because she has sex in a caravan. Their conclusion on Jodie left them undecided as to whether Jodie is the type of character to \\"fancy anything with a pulse\\" or out to \\"stir up trouble between every couple in town\\". In May 2012, Manning announced via her Twitter account that she had left the series. The actress thanked everyone who supported Jodie's storyline with Texas and described her time on the show as \\"fun\\". In August 2012, series producer Emma Smithwick told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that it was always planned that Jodie would depart the series because Texas and Dodger were \\"the main story\\". She explained that Jodie is a character who brought challenge to Dodger and Texas' lives and \\"turned the heads\\" of two people who thought that they were comfortable with who they were. But Jodie \\"ultimately reaffirmed what they both liked about each other\\". They used Jodie and a \\"detour\\" and Smithwick stressed that Jodie and Texas was never intended to be a lesbian storyline - rather about Jodie being pansexual and liking a person regardless of their gender. Jodie arrives to meet her friend Texas, who introduces her to Doug. Jodie agrees to meet up with Doug again for a drink. Doug presumes they are on a date and when it becomes clear he is not over his ex-girlfriend, Jodie tells him she is not interested in him romantically. Jodie then sleeps with Dodger who is surprised at her willingness to have a one-night stand. Jodie also makes friends with Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes), who initially takes a disliking to Jodie. Jodie and Dodger begin to flirt again but she rebuffs Dodger's advances. Jodie and Dodger sleep together again and Jodie admits that it meant something to her. She tells Texas she that she can do better than Dodger. When both Dodger and Doug compete for her affections, she arranges a night out with them and invites Texas. While both men wait, Texas tells Jodie that she should chose which one she wants, Jodie agrees and grabs Texas and kisses her, who reciprocates. Jodie senses that Texas is awkward around her and tries to resolve the situation. Texas tells her that she is straight and does not appreciate Jodie using her to make Dodger jealous. Jodie tells Texas that she actually likes her. Jodie enlists Texas and Dodger to help on her dance assignment. When Texas turns out to be a bad dancer, she asks Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) to take her place. Texas becomes jealous and gets drunk, Jodie helps her into bed and they lean in for a kiss. Waking up together the next morning, Jodie tells a relieved Texas that they did nothing sexual. Jodie helps Texas out on her photography course work and fails her own assignment. On a night out, Texas becomes jealous of Jodie, who is flirting with Theresa. Texas kisses Jodie, but the following day Texas will not talk about their encounter. Texas later decides to start a relationship with Jodie, but then becomes confused about Dodger once again and dumps Jodie, but they agree to remain friends.

History  Originally started in 1970 as Rapid Air, the company was purchased in 1974 and renamed Mombasa Air Services. Based in Mombasa MAS has, since that date, always served the coast tourism industry. An additional MAS company, Malindi Air Services, was created with the purchase of Sunbird Aviation ( Malindi) in 1977. A further company, Mombasa Air Services (Ukunda) Limited was added the same year with the purchase of Amphibians Ltd, based at Diani Beach at Ukunda airfield. The three companies were known as the M.A.S. group, and a fourth organisation, Mombasa Air School, was added to the group as an ab- initio pilot training school in 1978. To inject capital and provide growth the MAS group of companies was sold in 1982 to CMC Aviation, owned by Cooper Motor Corporation, a publicly-traded company, based in Nairobi. The MAS identity was changed to Cooper Skybird. In 1986 there was a further change of ownership to another publicly traded group, and the airline was named Prestige Air, and all its operations were transferred to Nairobi. The company eventually was wound down and ceased flight operations. In 1985 the original owners brought back the MAS name with a new aviation company under a new AOC that became known as Mombasa Air Safari. MAS operates along the Kenya coast with hubs at Mombasa ( Moi Airport) and Diani Beach (Ukunda Airfield) with regular departures also from Malindi. The airline colours are dark blue, light blue and gold and in 2004 the logo was changed to a lions paw, which is featured on all MAS aircraft tail fins. The MAS Air Operator Certificate Number 016 provides for air charter and also scheduled services for both PAX and CARGO operation. In 2008 the Kenya Ministry of Transport granted MAS the status of a designated carrier to for services to Tanzania. In 1995 the owners/directors of MAS created a separate maintenance company, Benair Engineering Limited that holds an Authorised Maintenance Certificate (AMO), based at Mombasa's Moi International Airport, to service the MAS fleet and undertake third-party maintenance to other airlines such as Blue Sky Aviation Services. Benair is an authorised LET Service Centre. Fleet Mombasa Air Safari operates eight Cessna 208 Grand Caravan aircraft.

No passengers were on board. Both pilots died. The accident report found no technical problem and cited possible pilot error with the flap settings. Two pilots and two passengers died on Wednesday 22 August 2012, after a 19-seat Let L-410UVP-E9, registration number 5Y-UV7, with 13 people on board, including 2 crew, crashed at an airstrip in the Maasai Mara Game Reserve.

Life  Born in Kor√ß√´, southern Albania, then part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, on July 28, 1911, Athanas and his mother Evangeline traveled on a donkey to a port and emigrated to Bedford, New York in 1915‚Äì16, where his father, who was a mason, and siblings had settled. At the age of thirteen Athanas left school and worked in several restaurants until 1938, when he bought his first restaurant: Anthony's Hawthorne Caf√© in Lynn, Massachusetts, which by the early 1950s had become the highest-grossing restaurant in Massachusetts, with profits of more than $1 million annually. The Lynn restaurant closed in 2008.

He studied Irish literature and obtained employment as a scribe with the Royal Irish Academy. Over the following twenty years he copied a great part of the Books of Lecan and Ballymote. When King George IV visited Ireland Connellan translated his \\"Letter to the Irish people\\" into Irish, and was appointed Irish historiographer to the king. When Queen's College was opened he was appointed professor of Irish at Cork. Despite some issues with the college president, Robert Kane, he held the chair until 1863.

Dispute with Henry Monck Mason In 1830 Henry J. Monck Mason, founder of Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language, dedicated to spreading the Scripture in Ireland through the means of the Irish language, published a Grammar of the Irish Language. In the preface of this book he acknowledged that he was not acquainted with Irish as a colloquial but only as a written language. Little notice was taken of the book until he was rash enough to print in the Christian Examiner for September 1833 a long letter on \\"The Irish Language\\", ostensibly a critique of Owen Connellan's edition of the Irish prayer-book, but in reality a personal attack upon him and Thady Connellan, a relative. Owen Connellan replied, as far as the editor of the magazine would allow him, in the October number (pp. 729‚Äì732). He showed that Mason's Grammar was a mass of errors, and that the pocket edition of Bishop Bedell's Irish Bible, issued by the Irish Society under Mason's supervision, was just as inaccurate.Christian Examiner, October 1833, pp. 729-732 In these strictures Connellan was supported by Dr. Charles Orpen and John O'Donovan.

Sacraments are visible rites seen as signs and efficacious channels of the grace of God to all those who receive them with the proper disposition. The sevenfold list of sacraments is often organized into three categories: the sacraments of initiation (into the Church, the body of Christ), consisting of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist; the sacraments of healing, consisting of Penance and Anointing of the Sick; and the sacraments of service: Holy Orders and Matrimony. Enumeration The seven sacraments of the Catholic Church = History = The number of the sacraments in the early church was variable and undefined; Peter Damian for example had listed eleven, including the ordination of kings. Hugh of Saint Victor enumerated nearly thirty, although he put Baptism and Holy Communion first with special relevance. The current seven sacraments were set out in the Sentences by Peter Lombard, and these seven were confirmed by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1213. = Current = The Catechism of the Catholic Church lists the sacraments as follows: \\"The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves around the Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments. There are seven sacraments in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.\\" The list of seven sacraments already given by the Council of Florence (1439)Clarence R. McAuliffe, Sacramental Theology (Herder 1958), p. 8 was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), (1545‚Äì1563), which stated: Dogmatic aspects \\"Sacred tradition and Sacred Scripture form one sacred deposit of the word of God, committed to the Church.\\" \\"In the liturgy, above all that of the sacraments, there is an immutable part, a part that is divinely instituted and of which the Church is the guardian, and parts that can be changed, which the Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the cultures of recently evangelized peoples.\\" Baptism cannot be changed to allow a non-Trinitarian formula. \\"Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion.\\" Regarding marriage, \\"basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that 'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered' [...] contrary to the natural law.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357 \\"The ordination of women is not possible.\\" The efficacy of sacraments does not depend on the celebrant's being in the state of grace. Their power comes not from the celebrant nor from the recipient but from God. In them Christ himself is at work. However, the actual effects (\\"the fruits\\") of the sacrament depends also on the recipient's disposition: \\"in order that the liturgy may be able to produce its full effects, it is necessary that the faithful come to it with proper dispositions, that their minds should be attuned to their voices, and that they should cooperate with divine grace lest they receive it in vain\\".Sacrosanctum Concilium, 11 Faith and grace Distribution of divine graces by means of the Catholic Church and the sacraments (Johannes Hopffe, Wrisberg epitaph, Hildesheim, before 1615) The Catholic Church teaches that the sacraments are \\"efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us.\\" The Church teaches that the effect of a sacrament comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it.New Catholic Dictionary However, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block the effectiveness of the sacrament in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, are meant to nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.Sacrosanctum Concilium, 59, quoted in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1123 While the Church itself is the universal sacrament of salvation, the sacraments of the Catholic Church in the strict sense are seven sacraments that \\"touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith\\". \\"The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the New Covenant are necessary for salvation\\", although not all are necessary for every individual.  Sacraments of initiation  The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"Christian initiation is accomplished by means of the sacraments which establish the foundations of Christian life. The faithful born anew by Baptism are strengthened by Confirmation and are then nourished by the Eucharist.\\" = Baptism = Scene of baptism. thumb The Roman Catholic Church sees baptism as the first and basic sacrament of Christian initiation. In the Western or Latin Church, baptism is usually conferred today by pouring water three times on the recipient's head, while reciting the baptismal formula: \\"I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\\" (cf. ). In the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite immersion or submersion is used, and the formula is: \\"The servant of God, N., is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\\" Though sprinkling is not normally used, its validity is accepted, provided that the water flows over the skin, since otherwise it is not a washing. =Confirmation= Confirmation or Chrismation is the second sacrament of Christian initiation. \\"It is called Chrismation (in the Eastern Churches: anointing with holy myron or chrism) because the essential rite of the sacrament is anointing with chrism. It is called Confirmation because it confirms and strengthens baptismal grace.\\" It is conferred by \\"the anointing with Sacred Chrism (oil mixed with balsam and consecrated by the bishop), which is done by the laying on of the hand of the minister who pronounces the sacramental words proper to the rite.\\" These words, in both their Western and Eastern variants, refer to a gift of the Holy Spirit that marks the recipient as with a seal. Through the sacrament the grace given in baptism is \\"strengthened and deepened.\\" Like baptism, confirmation may be received only once, and the recipient must be in a state of grace (meaning free from any known unconfessed mortal sin) in order to receive its effects. The \\"originating\\" minister of the sacrament is a validly consecrated bishop; if a priest (a \\"presbyter\\") confers the sacrament ‚Äì as is done ordinarily in the Eastern Churches and in special cases (such as the baptism of an adult or in danger of the death of a young child) in the Latin Church (CCC 1312‚Äì1313) ‚Äì the link with the higher order is indicated by the use of oil (known as \\"chrism\\" or \\"myron\\") blessed by the bishop on Holy Thursday itself or on a day close to it. In the East, which retains the ancient practice, the sacrament is administered by the parish priest immediately after baptism. In the West, where the sacrament is normally reserved for those who can understand its significance, it came to be postponed until the recipient's early adulthood; in the 20th century, after Pope Pius X introduced first Communion for children on reaching the age of discretion, the practice of receiving Confirmation later than the Eucharist became widespread;Liam G. Walsh, Sacraments of Initiation (Liturgy Training Publications 2011 ), pp. 153‚Äì154 but the traditional order, with Confirmation administered before First Communion, is being increasingly restored.John Flader, \\"The age for Confirmation\\" in Question Time (Taylor Trade 2010 ), pp. 86‚Äì87 =Eucharist= Saint Teresa, by Juan Mart√≠n Cabezalero, Museum of L√°zaro Galdiano, Madrid The Eucharist, also called the Blessed Sacrament, is the sacrament ‚Äì the third of Christian initiation, the one that the Catechism of the Catholic Church says \\"completes Christian initiation\\" ‚Äì by which Catholics partake of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ and participate in the Eucharistic memorial of his one sacrifice. The first of these two aspects of the sacrament is also called Holy Communion. The bread ‚Äì which must be wheaten, and which is unleavened in the Latin, Armenian and Ethiopic Rites, but is leavened in most Eastern Rites ‚Äì and wine ‚Äì which must be from grapes ‚Äì used in the Eucharistic rite are, in Catholic faith, transformed in their inner reality, though not in appearance, into the Body and Blood of Christ, a change that is called transubstantiation. \\"The minister who is able to confect the sacrament of the Eucharist in the person of Christ is a validly ordained priest alone.\\" The word \\"priest\\" here (in Latin sacerdos) includes both bishops and those priests who are also called presbyters.While in the English language, the word \\"priest\\" usually means someone received into the second of the three holy orders (also called the presbyterate) but not into the highest, that of bishop, the Latin text underlying this statement uses the Latin term sacerdos, which comprises both bishops and, in the common English sense, priests. To refer exclusively to priests in the more common English sense, Latin uses the word presbyter. See Dennis Chester Smolarski, The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 1969‚Äì2002: A Commentary (Liturgical Press 2003 ), p. 24. Deacons as well as priests (sacerdotes) are ordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and lay people may be authorized to act as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion. The Eucharistic celebration is seen as \\"the source and summit\\" of Christian living, the high point of God's sanctifying action on the faithful and of their worship of God, the point of contact between them and the liturgy of heaven. So important is it that participation in the Eucharistic celebration (see Mass) is seen as obligatory on every Sunday and holy day of obligation and is recommended on other days. Also recommended for those who participate in the Mass is reception, with the proper dispositions, of Holy Communion. This is seen as obligatory at least once a year, during Eastertide. = Restored order of initiation = During the second half of the 2010s some dioceses of Latin Rite in the United States, as elsewhere, returned to the original order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation, that is: Baptism, Confirmation and, lastly, first Communion. The Catechism of the Catholic Church references this order at No. 1212, and at No. 1322 says: \\"The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation.\\". Administering the Eucharist before Confirmation began in the Latin Rite, unlike other rites, in consequence of Pope Pius X's 1910 decree Quam singulari Christus amore (transl.: \\"How special was Christ's love\\"), which said Communion should not be delayed beyond when a child reaches the age of reason. U.S. dioceses complied but did not bring confirmation forward with it from a subsequent age.  Sacraments of healing  = Penance = The Sacrament of Penance (or Reconciliation) is the first of two sacraments of healing. The Catechism of the Catholic Church mentions in the following order and capitalization different names of the sacrament, calling it the sacrament of conversion, Penance, confession, forgiveness and Reconciliation. It is the sacrament of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from God resulting from sins committed. When people sin after baptism, they cannot have baptism as a remedy; Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, cannot be given a second time. The sacrament involves four elements: # Contrition (the penitent's sincere remorse for wrongdoing or sin, repentance, without which the rite has no effect); # Confession to a priest who has the faculty to hear confessions (Canon 966.1) ‚Äì while it may be spiritually helpful to confess to another, only a priest has the power to administer the sacrament; # Absolution by the priest; and, # Satisfaction or penance. \\"Many sins wrong our neighbour. One must do what is possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins. This satisfaction is also called 'penance'\\" (CCC 1459). In early Christian centuries, this element of satisfaction was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution, but now it usually involves a simple task for the penitent to perform later, in order to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further temptation. The priest is bound by the \\"seal of confession\\", which is inviolable. \\"Accordingly, it is absolutely wrong for a confessor in any way to betray the penitent, for any reason whatsoever, whether by word or in any other fashion.\\"canon 983 of the Code of Canon Law A confessor who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs an automatic excommunication whose lifting is reserved to the Holy See. In some dioceses, certain sins are \\"reserved\\" which means only certain confessors can absolve them. Some sins, such as violation of the sacramental seal, consecration of bishops without authorization by the Holy See, direct physical attacks on the Pope, and intentional desecration of the Eucharist are reserved to the Holy See. A special case-by-case faculty from the Sacred Penitentiary is normally required to absolve these sins. = Anointing of the Sick = Extreme Unction, from Rogier van der Weyden's altarpiece Anointing of the Sick is the second sacrament of healing. In this sacrament a priest anoints the sick with oil blessed specifically for that purpose. \\"The anointing of the sick can be administered to any member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger by reason of illness or old age\\" (canon 1004; cf. CCC 1514). A new illness or a worsening of health enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time. When, in the Western Church, the sacrament was conferred only on those in immediate danger of death, it came to be known as \\"Extreme Unction\\", i.e. \\"Final Anointing\\", administered as one of the Last Rites. The other Last Rites are Confession (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the Eucharist, which when administered to the dying is known as \\"bread for the journey\\" or by the Latin name \\"Viaticum\\", literally \\"provisions for a journey\\".  Sacraments of service  = Holy Orders = Holy Orders is the Sacrament by which a layman is made a deacon, a deacon is made a priest and a priest is made a bishop, dedicated for service to the Church. In descending order of rank, the three degrees are referred to as episcopate, presbyterate and diaconate. The bishop is the only minister of this sacrament. Ordination as a bishop confers the fullness of the sacrament, with membership of the College of Bishops, the successor body in the Church to that of the Apostles, and entrusting to him the threefold office to teach, sanctify, and govern the People of God. Ordination as a priest calls the priest to take, in the Eucharistic celebration, the role of Christ, the Head of the Church, the one essential High Priest, and confers on him the power and responsibility, as the bishop's assistant, to celebrate the sacraments except for Holy Orders. Ordination as a deacon configures the man in the service of the bishop, especially in the Church's exercise of Christian charity towards the poor, and preaching of the word of God. Men who discern a vocation to the priesthood are required by canon law (canon 1032 of the Code of Canon Law) to undertake a seminary program with graduate level philosophical and theological studies and a formation program that includes spiritual direction, retreats, apostolate experience, and learning some Latin. The course of studies in preparation for ordination as a \\"permanent\\" deacon (one not intending to become a priest) is decided by the regional episcopal conference. = Matrimony = Matrimony, from Rogier Van der Weyden's altarpiece Matrimony, or Marriage, is another sacrament that consecrates for a particular mission in building up the Church, and that provides grace for accomplishing that mission. This sacrament, seen as a sign of the love uniting Christ and the Church, establishes between the spouses a permanent and exclusive bond, sealed by God. Accordingly, a marriage between baptized people, validly entered into and consummated, cannot be dissolved. The sacrament confers on them the grace they need for attaining holiness in their married life and for responsible acceptance and upbringing of their children. As a condition for validity, the sacrament is celebrated in the presence of the local Ordinary or Parish Priest or of a cleric delegated by them (or in certain limited circumstances a lay person delegated by the diocesan Bishop with the approval of the Episcopal Conference and the permission of the Holy See) and at least two other witnesses,canons 1108 and 1112 of the Code of Canon Law though in the theological tradition of the Latin Church the ministers of the sacrament uniquely are the couple themselves. For a valid marriage, a man and a woman must express their conscious and free consent to a definitive self-giving to the other, excluding none of the essential properties and aims of marriage. If one of the two is a non-Catholic Christian, their marriage is licit only if the permission of the competent authority of the Catholic Church is obtained. If one of the two is not a Christian (i.e. has not been baptized), the competent authority's dispensation is necessary for validity. Validity and liceity As stated above, the effect of the sacraments comes ex opere operato (by the very fact of being administered). Since it is Christ who works through them, their effectiveness does not depend on the worthiness of the minister. The belief that the validity of the sacrament is dependent upon the holiness of the administrator was rejected in the Donatist crisis. However, an apparent administration of a sacrament is invalid if the person acting as minister does not have the necessary power (as if a deacon were to celebrate Mass). They are also invalid if the required \\"matter\\" or \\"form\\" is lacking. The matter is the perceptible material object, such as water in baptism or bread and wine for the Eucharist, or the visible action. The form is the verbal statement that specifies the signification of the matter, such as, (in the Western Church), \\"N., I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\\". Furthermore, if the minister positively excludes some essential aspect of the sacrament, the sacrament is invalid. This last condition lies behind the 1896 judgement of the Holy See denying the validity of Anglican Orders, a judgment that, though questioned, is still upheld. A sacrament may be administered validly, but illicitly, if a condition imposed by canon law is not observed. Obvious cases are administration of a sacrament by a priest under a penalty of excommunication or suspension, or an episcopal ordination without the Pontifical mandate (except in certain circumstances outlined in Canon Law). =Impediments= Canon law specifies impediments to reception of the sacraments of orders and marriage. Some impediments are merely prohibitive and only concern liceity, but a diriment impediment renders invalid any attempt to confer the sacrament. In the Latin Church, only the Holy See can authentically declare when divine law prohibits or invalidates a marriage, and only the Holy See has the right to establish for those who are baptised other impediments to marriage (canon 1075). But individual Eastern Catholic Churches, after having fulfilled certain requirements that include consulting (but not necessarily obtaining approval from) the Holy See, may establish impediments.Canon 792, Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches If an impediment is imposed by merely ecclesiastical law, rather than being a matter of divine law, the Church may grant a dispensation from the impediment. Conditions for validity of marriage such as sufficient use of reason (canon 1095) and freedom from coercion (canon 1103), and the requirement that, normally, a marriage be contracted in the presence of the local Ordinary or parish priest or of the priest or deacon delegated by either of them, and in the presence of two witnesses (canon 1108), are not classified in the Code of Canon Law as impediments, but have much the same effect. =Conditional conferral= Three of the sacraments may not be repeated: Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders: their effect is permanent. This teaching has been expressed by the images of, in the West, an indelible character or mark and of, in the East, a seal (CCC 698). However, if there is doubt about the validity of the administration of one or more of these sacraments, a conditional form of conferral may be used, such as: \\"If you are not already baptized, I baptize you ‚Ä¶\\"Code of Canon Law, canon 869; cf. New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law By John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J., pp. 1057‚Äì1059. In the recent past, it was common practice in the Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete instance. In the case of the major Protestant denominations, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Eastern Orthodox Church, but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It does not recognize a baptismal ceremony in which the names of the three divine persons (or hypostases) of the Trinity‚ÄîFather, Son and Holy Spirit‚Äîare replaced by descriptors such as Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, or Creator, Liberator, and Sustainer, and requires that the conditional form should not be used when baptizing those who have received this kind of baptism.

There are various views on the existence and meaning of such rites. Many Christians consider the sacraments to be a visible symbol of the reality of God, as well as a channel for God's grace. Many denominations, including the Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed, hold to the definition of sacrament formulated by Augustine of Hippo: an outward sign of an inward grace, that has been instituted by Jesus Christ. Sacraments signify God's grace in a way that is outwardly observable to the participant. The Catholic Church, Hussite Church, and the Old Catholic Church recognise seven sacraments: Baptism, Reconciliation (Penance or Confession), Eucharist (or Holy Communion), Confirmation, Marriage (Matrimony), Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick (Extreme Unction). The Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church also believe that there are seven major sacraments, but apply the corresponding Greek word, ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (mysterion), also to rites that in the Western tradition are called sacramentals and to other realities, such as the Church itself.Sacramental Rites in the Coptic Orthodox Church. Copticchurch.net. 4 August 2016. Many Protestant denominations, such as those within the Reformed tradition, identify two sacraments instituted by Christ, the Eucharist (or Holy Communion) and Baptism. The Lutheran sacraments include these two, often adding Confession (and Absolution) as a third sacrament. Anglican and Methodist teaching is that \\"there are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,\\" and that \\"those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel.\\"Thirty-Nine Articles, Article XXVArticles of Religion (Methodist), Article XVI Some traditions, such as Quakerism, do not observe any of the rites, or, in the case of Anabaptists, hold that they are simply reminders or commendable practices that do not impart actual grace‚Äînot sacraments but \\"ordinances\\" pertaining to certain aspects of the Christian faith.Jeffrey Gros, Thomas F. Best, Lorelei F. Fuchs (editors), Growth in Agreement III: International Dialogue Texts and Agreed Statements, 1998‚Äì2005 (Eerdmans 2008 ), p. 352 Etymology The English word \\"\\" is derived indirectly from the Ecclesiastical Latin sacrƒÅmentum, from Latin sacr≈ç (\\"hallow, consecrate\\"), from sacer (\\"sacred, holy\\"). This in turn is derived from the Greek New Testament word \\"mysterion\\". In Ancient Rome, the term meant a soldier's oath of allegiance. Tertullian, a 3rd-century Christian writer, suggested that just as the soldier's oath was a sign of the beginning of a new life, so too was initiation into the Christian community through baptism and Eucharist.

McAuliffe, Sacramental Theology (Herder 1958), p. 8 was reaffirmed by the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563), which stated: The seven sacraments of the Catholic church: Baptism, Confirmation, Matrimony, Eucharist, Penance, Holy Orders and the Anointing of the Sick During the Middle Ages, sacramental records were in Latin. Even after the Reformation, many ecclesiastical leaders continued using this practice into the 20th century. On occasion, Protestant ministers followed the same practice. Since W was not part of the Latin alphabet, scribes only used it when dealing with names or places. In addition, names were modified to fit a \\"Latin mold\\". For instance, the name Joseph would be rendered as Iosephus or Josephus. The Catholic Church indicates that the sacraments are necessary for salvation, though not every sacrament is necessary for every individual. The Church applies this teaching even to the sacrament of baptism, the gateway to the other sacraments. It states that \\"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.\\" But it adds: \\"God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments,\\" and accordingly, \\"since Christ died for the salvation of all, those can be saved without Baptism who die for the faith (Baptism of blood). Catechumens and all those who, even without knowing Christ and the Church, still (under the impulse of grace) sincerely seek God and strive to do his will can also be saved without Baptism (Baptism of desire). The Church in her liturgy entrusts children who die without Baptism to the mercy of God.\\" In the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, \\"the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.\\" While the sacraments in the Catholic Church are regarded as means of Divine Grace, The Catholic definition of a sacrament is an event in Christian life that is both spiritual and physical.https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2.htm The seven Catholic sacraments have been separated into three groups. The first three Sacraments of Initiation are Baptism, Communion, and Confirmation. The two Healing Sacraments are Anointing of the Sick and Penance. The two Sacraments of Vocation are Matrimony and Holy Orders. The Church teaches that the effect of the sacraments comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it.New Catholic Dictionary However, as indicated in this definition of the sacraments given by the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block a sacrament's effectiveness in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and, through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.Sacrosanctum Concilium, 59, quoted in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1123 Though not every individual has to receive every sacrament, the Church affirms that for believers the sacraments are necessary for salvation. Through each of them, Christ bestows that sacrament's particular healing and transforming grace of the Holy Spirit, making them participants in the divine nature through union with Christ. Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy The Eastern Orthodox tradition does not limit the number of sacraments to seven, holding that anything the Church does as Church is in some sense sacramental. However, it recognizes these seven as \\"the major sacraments\\" which are completed by many other blessings and special services. Some lists of the sacraments taken from the Church Fathers include the consecration of a church, monastic tonsure, and the burial of the dead.Meyendorff, J. (1979). The Sacraments in the Orthodox Church, in Byzantine Theology. Obtained online at More specifically, for the Eastern Orthodox the term \\"sacrament\\" is a term which seeks to classify something that may, according to Orthodox thought, be impossible to classify. The Orthodox communion's preferred term is \\"Sacred Mystery\\", and the Orthodox communion has refrained from attempting to determine absolutely the exact form, number and effect of the sacraments, accepting simply that these elements are unknowable to all except God. On a broad level, the mysteries are an affirmation of the goodness of created matter, and are an emphatic declaration of what that matter was originally created to be. Baptism and Chrismation, the sacraments of initiation, in an Eastern Orthodox church Despite this broad view, Orthodox divines do write about there being seven \\"principal\\" mysteries. On a specific level, while not systematically limiting the mysteries to seven, the most profound Mystery is the Eucharist or Synaxis, in which the partakers, by participation in the liturgy and receiving the consecrated bread and wine (understood to have become the body and blood of Christ) directly communicate with God. No claim is made to understand how exactly this happens. The Eastern Orthodox merely state: \\"This appears to be in the form of bread and wine, but God has told me it is His Body and Blood. I will take what He says as a 'mystery' and not attempt to rationalize it to my limited mind\\".Holy Eucharist obtained online at http://www.orthodoxy.org.au/eng/index.php?p=74 The emphasis on mystery is characteristic of Orthodox theology, and is often called apophatic, meaning that any and all positive statements about God and other theological matters must be balanced by negative statements. For example, while it is correct and appropriate to say that \\"God exists\\", or even that \\"God is the only Being which truly exists\\", such statements must be understood to also convey the idea that God transcends what is usually meant by the term \\"to exist\\". The seven sacraments are also accepted by Oriental Orthodoxy, including the Coptic Orthodox Church,Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate, Archdiocese of North America, \\"Church Sacraments\\" Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the Armenian Orthodox Church. Anglicanism and Methodism Anglican and Methodist sacramental theology reflects its dual roots in the Catholic tradition and the Protestant Reformation. The Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism and Methodism places on the sacraments as a means of grace and sanctification, while the Reformed tradition has contributed a marked insistence on \\"lively faith\\" and \\"worthy reception\\". Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians participating in an Anglican/Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission declared that they had \\"reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\\".See Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation and Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement. Accessed 15 October 2007. Similarly, Methodist/Roman Catholic Dialogue has affirmed that \\"Methodists and Catholics affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. This reality does not depend on the experience of the communicant, although it is only by faith that we become aware of Christ's presence.\\" The Catholic Church and the World Methodist Council jointly understand the word \\"sacrament\\" as referring not only to the sacraments considered here, but also to Christ and the Church. Article XXV of the Thirty- Nine Articles in Anglicanism and Article XVI of the Articles of Religion in Methodism recognise only two sacraments (Baptism and the Supper of the Lord) since these are the only ones ordained by Christ in the Gospel. The article continues stating that \\"Those five commonly called Sacraments ... are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel ... but have not the like nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord's Supper, for they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained by God.\\" These phrases have led to a debate as to whether the five are to be called sacraments or not. A recent author writes that the Anglican Church gives \\"sacramental value to the other five recognised by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches\\" but these \\"do not reveal those essential aspects of redemption to which Baptism and Communion point\\". Some Anglicans maintain that the use of \\"commonly\\" implies that the others can legitimately be called sacraments (perhaps more exactly \\"Sacraments of the Church\\" as opposed to \\"Sacraments of the Gospel\\"); others object that at the time the Articles were written \\"commonly\\" meant \\"inaccurately\\" and point out that the Prayer Book refers to the creeds \\"commonly called the Apostles' Creed\\" and the \\"Athanasian\\" where both attributions are historically incorrect. Anglicans are also divided as to the effects of the sacraments. Some hold views similar to the Roman Catholic ex opere operato theory. Article XXVI (entitled Of the unworthiness of ministers which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament) states that the \\"ministration of the Word and Sacraments\\" is not done in the name of the minister, \\"neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness,\\" since the sacraments have their effect \\"because of Christ's intention and promise, although they be ministered by evil men\\". As in Roman Catholic theology, the worthiness or unworthiness of the recipient is of great importance. Article XXV in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Anglicanism and Article XVI in the Articles of Religion in Methodism states: \\"And in such only as worthily receive the [sacraments], they have a wholesome effect and operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase for themselves damnation,\\" and Article XXVIII in Anglicanism's Thirty-Nine Articles (Article XVIII in Methodism's Articles of Religion) on the Lord's Supper affirms \\"to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\\". In the Exhortations of the Prayer Book rite, the worthy communicant is bidden to \\"prepare himself by examination of conscience, repentance and amendment of life and above all to ensure that he is in love and charity with his neighbours\\" and those who are not \\"are warned to withdraw\\". This particular question was fiercely debated in the 19th century arguments over Baptismal Regeneration. Lutheranism The Church is the congregation of saints, in which the Gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered. ‚ÄìAugsburg ConfessionSee Augsburg Confession, Article 7, Of the Church Lutherans hold that sacraments are sacred acts of divine institution., , , , , Whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God, , , , along with the divine words of institution,, , , God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component., , , He earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament, , forgiveness of sins, , , , , , , and eternal salvation., , He also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession., , Melanchthon's Apology of the Augsburg Confession defines sacraments, according to the German text, as \\"outward signs and ceremonies that have God's command and have an attached divine promise of graces\\". His Latin text was shorter: \\"rites that have the command of God, and to which is added a promise of grace\\".Apologia Augustanae Confessionis quote=die √§u√üerlichen Zeichen und Ceremonien, die da haben Gottes Befehl und haben eine angehefte g√∂ttlichen Zusage der Gnaden (p. 367); ritus, qui habent mandatum dei et quibus addita est promissio gratiae This strict definition narrowed the number of sacraments down to three: Holy Baptism, the Eucharist, and Holy Absolution, with the other four rites eliminated for not having the ability to forgive sin, although at least one or two have the command of God. Lutherans do not dogmatically define the exact number of sacraments.The Apology of the Augsburg Confession XIII, 2: \\"We believe we have the duty not to neglect any of the rites and ceremonies instituted in Scripture, whatever their number. We do not think it makes much difference if, for purposes of teaching, the enumeration varies, provided what is handed down in Scripture is preserved\\" (cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 211). In line with Luther's initial statement in his Large Catechism some Lutherans speak of only two sacraments,Luther's Large Catechism IV, 1: \\"We have now finished the three chief parts of the common Christian doctrine. Besides these we have yet to speak of our two Sacraments instituted by Christ, of which also every Christian ought to have at least an ordinary, brief instruction, because without them there can be no Christian; although, alas! hitherto no instruction concerning them has been given\\" (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 733). Baptism and the Eucharist, although later in the same work he calls Confession and AbsolutionJohn 20:23, and Engelder, T.E.W., Popular Symbolics. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 112‚Äì3, Part XXVI \\"The Ministry\\", paragraph 156. \\"the third sacrament\\".Luther's Large Catechism IV, 74‚Äì75: \\"And here you see that Baptism, both in its power and signification, comprehends also the third Sacrament, which has been called repentance, as it is really nothing else than Baptism\\" (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 751). The definition of sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession lists Absolution as one of them.The Apology of the Augsburg Confession XIII, 3, 4: \\"If we define the sacraments as rites, which have the command of God and to which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to determine what the sacraments are, properly speaking. For humanly instituted rites are not sacraments, properly speaking, because human beings do not have the authority to promise grace. Therefore signs instituted without the command of God are not sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps serve to teach or admonish the common folk. Therefore, the sacraments are actually baptism, the Lord‚Äôs Supper, and absolution (the sacrament of repentance)\\" (cf. Tappert, 211). Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article 13, Of the Number and Use of the Sacraments It is important to note that although Lutherans do not consider the other four rites as sacraments, they are still retained and used in the Lutheran church (with the exception of Extreme Unction although some Lutheran churches do practice it Fink, Peter E., S.J., ed. Anointing of the Sick. Alternative Futures for Worship, vol. 7. Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1987). Luther himself around the time of his marriage and afterwards became one of the greatest champions of Marriage (Holy Matrimony), and the other two (Confirmation and Ordination) were kept in the Lutheran Church for purposes of good order. Within Lutheranism, the sacraments are a Means of Grace, and, together with the Word of God, empower the Church for mission.Use and Means of Grace, Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1997, 56 Reformed (Continental Reformed, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian) Henry John Dobson's A Scottish Sacrament John Calvin defined a sacrament as an earthly sign associated with a promise from God. He accepted only two sacraments as valid under the new covenant: baptism and the Lord's Supper. He and all Reformed theologians following him completely rejected the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the treatment of the Supper as a sacrifice. He also could not accept the Lutheran doctrine of sacramental union in which Christ was \\"in, with and under\\" the elements. The Westminster Confession of Faith also limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper. Sacraments are denoted \\"signs and seals of the covenant of grace\\". Westminster speaks of \\"a sacramental relation, or a sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other\\". Baptism is for infant children of believers as well as believers, as it is for all the Reformed except Baptists and some Congregationalists. Baptism admits the baptized into the visible church, and in it all the benefits of Christ are offered to the baptized. On the Lord's supper, Westminster takes a position between Lutheran sacramental union and Zwinglian memorialism: \\"the Lord's supper really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.\\" Latter Day Saints Members of the Latter-day Saint movement often use the word \\"ordinance\\" in the place of the word \\"sacrament\\", but the actual theology is sacramental in nature. Latter-day Saint ordinances are understood as conferring an invisible form of grace of a saving nature and are required for salvation and exaltation. Latter-day Saints often use the word \\"sacrament\\" to refer specifically to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, also known as the Lord's Supper, in which participants eat bread and drink wine (or water, since the late 1800s) as tokens of the flesh and blood of Christ. In Latter-day Saint congregations, the sacrament is normally provided every Sunday as part of the sacrament meeting and, like other Latter-day Saint ordinances such as baptism and confirmation, is considered an essential and sacred rite. Latter-day Saint ordinances which are considered \\"saving\\" include Baptism, Confirmation, Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist), Ordination (for males), Initiatory (called Chrismation in other Christian Traditions), Endowment (similar to a monastic initiation involving the taking of vows and reception of priestly clothing), and Marriage. In the Community of Christ, eight sacraments are recognized, including \\"baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, the Lord's Supper, ordination, marriage, the Evangelist Blessing, and administration to the sick\\". Other traditions The Eucharist is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations. The enumeration, naming, understanding, and the adoption of the sacraments formally vary according to denomination, although the finer theological distinctions are not always understood and may not even be known to many of the faithful. Many Protestants and other post-Reformation traditions affirm Luther's definition and have only Baptism and Eucharist (or Communion or the Lord's Supper) as sacraments, while others see the ritual as merely symbolic, and still others do not have a sacramental dimension at all. In addition to the traditional seven sacraments, other rituals have been considered sacraments by some Christian traditions. In particular, foot washing as seen in Anabaptist, Schwarzenau Brethren, German Baptist groups or True Jesus Church, and the hearing of the Gospel, as understood by a few Christian groups (such as the Polish National Catholic Church of America–ü–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å ), have been considered sacraments by some churches. The Assyrian Church of the East holds the Holy Leaven and the sign of the cross as sacraments. Since some post-Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically sacerdotal or priestly function, they avoid the term \\"sacrament\\", preferring the terms \\"sacerdotal function\\", \\"ordinance\\", or \\"tradition\\". This belief invests the efficacy of the ordinance in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation. This view stems from a highly developed concept of the priesthood of all believers. In this sense, the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role. Baptists and Pentecostals, among other Christian denominations, use the word ordinance rather than sacrament because of certain sacerdotal ideas connected, in their view, with the word sacrament. These churches argue that the word ordinance points to the ordaining authority of Christ which lies behind the practice. =Non-sacramental churches= Some denominations do not have a sacramental dimension (or equivalent) at all. The Salvation Army does not practice formal sacraments for a variety of reasons, including a belief that it is better to concentrate on the reality behind the symbols; however, it does not forbid its members from receiving sacraments in other denominations.The Salvation Army: Why does The Salvation Army not baptise or hold communion? . The Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) also do not practice formal sacraments, believing that all activities should be considered holy. Rather, they are focused on an inward transformation of one's whole life. Some Quakers use the words \\"Baptism\\" and \\"Communion\\" to describe the experience of Christ's presence and his ministry in worship. The Clancularii were an Anabaptist group in the 16th century who reasoned that because religion was seated in the heart, there was no need of any outward expression through the sacraments. Members of the Chinese new religious movement known as The Church of Almighty God, or Eastern Lightning, do not practice formal sacraments per the Church's theology.

The position of the name on the lists implies that Muspa was somewhere on the southwest coast of Florida between the Calusa capitol, believed to have been Mound Key, and Cape Sable. Depositions given by Franciscan missionaries expelled by the Calusa Chief in 1697 also place Muspa on or near Marco Island.Hann:20-25, 29 Marco Island is in the Ten Thousand Islands district of the Glades culture area, as defined in archeology. Around 1300, pottery and artifact styles on Marco island changed to become very similar to those of the Caloosahatchee culture, practiced by the Calusa people to the north, indicating a close alliance with or absorption by the Calusa.MacMahon and Marquardt:6 Muspa was an important sub-chiefdom under the Calusa chief. In 1623 Muspa was named by the Spanish as one of five places in southern Florida they searched for treasure that may have been recovered by Florida Indians from the wrecked treasure fleet of 1622. When the Franciscan missionaries were expelled from the Calusa capital in 1697, they were escorted to the Florida Keys by the Chief of Muspa.Hann:34, 89 Muspa, along with all Calusa territory, was subject to frequent raids early in the 18th century by Muscogee and Yamasee people allied with the English of the Province of Carolina. Refugees from all of the indigenous peoples of southern Florida tried to flee to Cuba. The Chief of Muspa was among 270 refugees who arrived in Cuba in 1711. Along with most of the other refugees, he died there shortly afterwards.Hann:56-57, 179-80 The indigenous peoples of southern Florida, including the Muspa, were largely gone by the time Florida was transferred from Spain to Britain in 1763. People living in the area of Charlotte Harbor in the 18th century and early 19th century were called \\"Muspa\\", and it was long assumed that they were remnants of the Calusa. Indians living in the area were associated with Spanish-Cuban fishing ranchos, and historians have now concluded that, at least in the 19th century, most of those people were descendants of Muscogean people, who elsewhere in Florida became known as Seminoles.

Education  Born in New Orleans, in the Touro Infirmary, because no nursing center existed in Brookhaven, Brady graduated from the Brookhaven High School on 1920 and then went to the Lawrenceville School (Class of 1923) and then to the Yale University (Class of 1927). The next year Brady went to the University of Michigan Law School, then to the University of Mississippi, where he completed his law studies and also was instructor there. Parallel to this, he was a member of the Society of Science.  Legal career  Upon graduating from law school on 1930, Brady joined his father's firm, Brady, Dean and Hobbs. In July 1963, he was appointed an Associate Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court to complete the unexpired term of Justice R. Olney Arrington, and would serve until his death. While there, in spite of his personal segregationist views, he ruled on 1965 a White-only park in Greenwood was to be integrated, and vacated one year later the conviction of a Black by an All-White grand jury.  Political activism  In an interview, Brady affirmed his passion for politics came on 1932, when he heard Paul B. Johnson Sr. and Martin Sennet Conner in Brookhaven. That year he attended his first Democratic National Convention in Chicago; followed by the DNC in Chicago in 1936, the 1948 event in Philadelphia, during which he was the Chairman of the Speakers Bureau for the Dixiecrats, and the 1960 one in Atlantic City. He served as a Democratic National Committeeman from 1960 to 1964, on the urging of Ross Barnett and State Executive Committee members who wanted an anti-Civil Rights delegate to the Convention, and who thereafter refused to sign any loyalty pledge, describing this obligation as \\"smack[ing] of totalitarianism\\". Brady rose to national prominence through his strident discourse against civil rights and integration. On October 28, 1954 while a Mississippi Circuit Court Judge he delivered an address entitled 'Black Monday' to the Sons of the American Revolution in Greenwood, Mississippi, which he later published in an eponymously-titled book.Brady, Tom P., Black Monday, Winona, Mississippi: Association of Citizens' Councils, 1955. https://www.amazon.com/Black-Monday-Tom-P- Brady/dp/B0006AUD92/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1406224973&sr;=8-4&keywords;=black+monday+brady He later gave the copyrights to the Citizens' Council, earning them enough funds to operate. In 1965, Time magazine called Brady \\"the philosopher of Mississippi's racist white Citizens' Councils.\\" He later affirmed he was offered three times since 1925 to join the Ku Klux Klan but always refused.  Political and racial views  Brady was a white supremacist: in Black Monday Brady opined on the sanctity of Southern white women (\\"[t]he loveliest and the purest of God's creatures, the nearest thing to an angelic being that treads this terrestrial ball is a well-bred, cultured Southern white woman or her blue-eyed, golden-haired little girl\\") and the bestiality of Blacks: > You can dress a chimpanzee, housebreak him, and teach him to use a knife and > fork, but it will take countless generations of evolutionary development, if > ever, before you can convince him that a caterpillar or a cockroach is not a > delicacy.

It is currently owned by the Baring family, Barons Ashburton. English Heritage have a guardianship deed on the scheduled monument and Grade I listed building, with the Grade II* listed gardens and monument's exterior open to the public. The house and gardens are also available to rent for parties and weddings. Grange Park Opera staged opera at The Grange every Summer from 1998- to 2016. From June 2017 The Grange Festival will become the new resident opera company. 17th‚Äî18th centuries  1662: Robert Henley bought the estate and a modest house known as The Grange. In 1665 he commissioned William Samwell to build an impressive four storey red brick residence to replace the house. 1764: Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington (1708‚Äì1772) commissioned Robert Adam to design a kitchen block and an entrance bridge. The same year he laid out a naturalistic English landscape park, including a lake and folly. 1787: The second Earl died childless and his sisters sold the house to the Drummond banking family. 1795: The Grange was leased to George, Prince of Wales as a hunting lodge with over 400 deer in the park. 19th century = Greek Revival temple = East Elevation In 1804, Henry Drummond commissioned his friend the architect William Wilkins to transform his brick house into a neoclassical Ancient Greek temple. Wilkins, a promising young architect and antiquary, had been much influenced by his recent travels to Greece and Asia Minor. The massive Doric portico is a copy of the Theseion in Athens and the side elevations imitate the Choragic Monument of Thrasyllus.History of Northington Grange, English Heritage Whilst commonly claimed to be the earliest Greek Revival style house in Europe, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, for instance, was using the primitive Greek Doric at Hammerwood Park in 1792. The transformation was largely external - the old house was literally wrapped in Roman cement, a very hard render made from ground flint. This is when the podium visible today was built. What had been ground floor rooms became basement rooms and the main reception rooms which had been on the piano nobile were now at the same level as the podium. The windows of servants‚Äô rooms on the uppermost storey were covered by the entablature of the temple facade, and is partly why it was necessary to extend the house. As at Hammerwood, the giant Doric portico is echoed by a single storey portico behind so as to provide an enhanced perspective when viewed from the hill opposite beyond the lake in the style of the Picturesque.Google satellite image. The intended perspective trick available from the park is demonstrated by the gap in the woodland opposite in the appropriate position which would have been the intended viewing point, visible on the satellite photograph. The lake may or may not have been able to mirror the building from this point. In 1817, before the works were finished, Drummond sold the house to Alexander Baring, second son of Sir Francis Baring who owned Stratton Park, five miles north of The Grange. = Additions = On 6 November 1819, Baring ordered from the Birmingham ironmasters Jones & Clark two metallic pine houses to be built in the new walled kitchen garden on the opposite side of the lake about half mile south east of The Grange. He later ordered peach houses and vineries. In 1820, Alexander Baring commissioned Robert Smirke, a pupil of George Dance, to build the single storey west wing. He increased the size of the park, extended the flower gardens, and planted many ornamental trees, such as the cedars which survive today. In about 1821 he purchased Buckenham Tofts, an estate near Thetford in Norfolk, with a large neo-classical house. Orangery The Conservatory In January 1823, Baring invited Charles Robert Cockerell to visit and discuss proposed additions. Designs were ready by June and included an elegant dining room (now demolished) and orangery conservatory (approx 80‚Äòx50‚Äô) with a four columned Ionic portico on its east elevation. In December 1823 Baring spent two days discussing the conservatory design with Jones (of Jones & Clark) and the order was placed the following March. There were two large rectangular planting beds running the length of the building with a central and an outer walkway all the way round, paved in Portland stone. Slim hollow cast iron columns held up the roofs and channelled rainwater into a large reservoir under the portico which supplied the house and the conservatory.History of Northington Grange, English Heritage The external elevations were rendered pilasters with full length glazed sashes of rolled iron with copper sash bars. The side lights and the doors at each end were mahogany glazed with British glass. In 1826, writing in the Gardener's Magazine, Baring‚Äôs head gardener, Peter McArthur, gives technical details of the building, the balance of humidity, light and heat, how the beds were constructed, the mix of soils, a list of about 150 plants ‚Äúthe principal and most conspicuous sorts‚Äù. The vestibule inside the east end of the conservatory had standing boxes of orange trees, camellias, proteas and magnolias which were brought out onto the terraces for the summer (picture). Around this time terrace gardens with fountains and balustrades were finished. In January 1827 Jones & Clark wrote to Baring ‚ÄúWe think we may safely venture to affirm that the conservatory at The grange is not surpassed by anything of the kind in the United Kingdom.‚Äù'‚ÄúThe whole of the conservatory, with the exception of the brick and stone work, was executed, and its different parts put together at our Birmingham and aftwards [re-]erected in its present situation by our own workmen.‚Äù This use of prefabrication was revolutionary and a precursor to Paxton's Crystal Palace. In June 1828 Cockerell took his new bride, Anna Maria (n√©e Rennie) to The Grange. = Further additions and alterations = Grange Park photographed in 1870 In 1852, Frederick Pepys Cockerell (son of C. R. Cockerell) added a second storey to Smirke‚Äôs west wing. In 1868, John Cox further extended the buildings and modernised the interiors. This was the heyday of the house - with a staff of more than a hundred and exuberant house parties attended by Thomas Carlyle, Alfred Lord Tennyson and other society figures. The grand hostess at this time was Lady Ashburton who was renowned for her wit and intelligence.K. D. Reynolds, ‚ÄòBaring , Harriet Mary, Lady Ashburton (1805‚Äì1857)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 13 Jan 2015 In 1890, Francis Baring, the 5th Lord Ashburton, sold Bath House in Piccadilly, and to accommodate his paintings, converted the orangery into a picture gallery which doubled as a ballroom. Cockerell‚Äôs full-height external window sashes were removed and walls built in their place. The interior and planted beds were removed and the walls were plastered and fitted with oak dado panelling and a new flat partly glazed ceiling inserted. 20th century = Wallach era = In 1934 The Grange and 600 acres of the park were sold to Charles Wallach whose fortune was from the medicinal use of paraffin and other petroleum by-products. The rest of the estate remained in the ownership of the Baring family. In the October 1935 edition of Antique Collector it was stated that The Grange ‚Äúwhich seemed doomed to become derelict‚Äù had ‚Äúduring the last 18 months been transformed into a palace of art treasures entirely fitting its former glory‚Äù. The picture gallery ‚Äúformerly a ball-room had been debased to a badminton court before Mr Wallach adapted it to its present purpose. In 1943 Wallach allowed the American Army to use the main house, and soldiers of the 47th US Infantry enjoyed a large Christmas party in the picture gallery. On 24 March 1944 Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower met at The Grange to discuss the Invasion of Normandy. = Baring family returns = In 1964 Charles Wallach died and the main house and 600 acre park was bought again by John Baring, now 7th Lord Ashburton, who promptly demolished the rear wing of the main building and, in 1972, proposed to dynamite the remainder. However, the furious correspondence in The Times persuaded the Hon. John Baring to pass the house into the voluntary guardianship of the Department of the Environment with a commitment from the Government to pay for restoration to enable public access. The Government quickly reneged on this and neglected the house until 1978 when, following a vigorous campaign by the conservation group, SAVE Britain's Heritage, the Government was forced to honour its pledge and, at a cost of ¬£500,000, stopped the decline and secured the house. However, with the loss of the interiors and so much of the building, The Grange is now probably the most impressive and beautiful garden ornament in England.  Opera house  The Grange from the south-east 2013 Martha Fiennes used The Grange for her film Onegin, starring her brother Ralph Fiennes, in 1998. The picture gallery served as Onegin's library. Grange Park Opera staged its first summer festival at The Grange in 1998. A new theatre was designed by Studio E Architects in 2002, to convert the interior of the former orangery-picture gallery for performances. The project won the RIBA Award 2004, RIBA Conservation Commendation 2004, Georgian Group Award for Best New Building in a Georgian Context 2004 and was shortlisted for the Crown Estate Conservation Award 2004.Studio E Architects, Grange Park Opera project In 2015 a dispute arose over rental payments and, as a result, Grange Park Opera left the Grange Estate after the 2016 season. A new opera company led by Michael Chance CBE has been launched to continue performances at this Hampshire landmark. The Grange Festival opened on 7 June 2017 with operas by Monteverdi, Mozart, Bizet and Britten.

It is one of Alberta's top 100 companies in terms of profit (85) and assets (94). It is the biggest transporter of oil sands' bitumen (over 1 million bbls/d after the Cold Lake oil sands upgrade) and in 2010 it was Alberta's 23rd fastest growing business. Soon after the millennium, the energy infrastructure business was divided into 4 segments: conventional oil pipelines, natural gas extraction, liquid storage and oilsands transportation. Major companies such as Encana, Canadian Natural Resources, Shell Canada, Chevron, Marathon Oil and Imperial Oil rely on the pipelines for transportation of oil to refineries and distribution to markets. In 2010 other Canadian trusts/funds converted to corporations but Inter Pipeline's board of directors decided against it citing costs, a lack of tax benefits and the market response to other companies that converted. Overseas it operates in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands. via its subsidiary Inter Terminals Limited (formerly Simon Storage Limited) a bulk liquid storage business. History Inter Pipeline's origins go back to 1997 to Koch Industries a refiner out of which sprang two pipelines one of which formed Koch Pipelines Canada, a conventional oil pipeline transportation company that Inter Pipeline directly traces its roots to. Within the next year it went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange listing under the symbol KPC.UN. * In 2000 it purchased a 15% interest in the Cold Lake pipeline system which it later increased to a controlling stake through a deal with Encana. * In early 2003 it purchased a 70% interest in the Cold Lake Pipeline system from Encana for $425 million giving it access to transportation hubs in major cities like Edmonton. * In 2004 it paid Williams Companies US$540 million for 3 of Canada's biggest natural gas treatment plants (which processed a combined 3.9 billion ft3 per day). That move gave it direct access to gas supplies from the Mackenzie Delta. * In 2005 Inter Pipeline entered the European bulk liquid storage market by buying Simon Storage, the UK's biggest terminal operator for C$250 million. * In 2006 annual revenue reached $1 billion after the $38 million takeover of German storage company Tanklager-Gesellschaft Hoyer mbH (TLG) * It entered the oilsands in March 2007 when it acquired the Corridor Pipeline from Houston-based Kinder Morgan for C$275 million in cash and C$485 million in debt; the deal gave Inter Pipeline the infrastructure used to transport about 30% of the oilsands output (including the 85% interest it had in Cold Lake it is 50%) but also left it with a $1.8 billion infrastructure expansion commitment). A decision by Enbridge and Inter Pipeline to move their pipelines east of the Labiche River helped to reduce the environmental impact and risk associated with the pipelines. * In 2018 Inter Pipeline Ltd. acquired NuStar Energy L.P.'s European bulk liquid storage business (\\"NuStar Europe\\") for cash consideration of US$270 million. * In August 2019 Inter Pipeline Ltd. announced that it was exploring the sale of its European bulk liquid storage business. * In August 2019 Inter Pipeline Ltd. confirmed that it received a \\"proposal\\" unsolicited take-over bid to purchase the company, after trading in its stock was halted by the market regulator. In September 2019, it was disclosed that Li Ka-shing was the author of the rejected $12.4 billion proposal. Operations The business segments are: * Cold Lake - the transportation system sends oil from Cold Lake to Edmonton and Hardisty Alberta. Much of the expansion happened in 2008 when its capacity increased from a 330,000 bbl/d to 560,000 bbl/d. Between it and Corridor there are 1,900 km of pipeline. * Corridor Pipeline - offers services related to oil sands storage and transport. * Bulk Liquid Storage - The Inter Terminals business (headquartered in Redhill, Surrey, in the UK), is a bulk liquid storage provider with more than 5.8 million cubic metres of storage capacity (approximately 37 million barrels) located across 23 terminals in the UK, Eire, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and The Netherlands. * Conventional Oil Pipelines - The Bow River, Central Alberta and Mid-Saskatchewan pipeline systems which transport almost 200,000 bbls/d to locations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. * NGL Extraction - Includes 2 wholly owned plus a 50% owned natural gas processing facilities. At the NGL's processing plants natural gas is separated from associated liquids which contain valuable ethane and a mix of propane, butane and pentane. The liquids components have a variety of uses ranging from asphalt to lubricants.

It is bounded by the River Welland and the River Glen, and is extensively drained, but the efficient drainage of the land exercised the minds of several of the great civil engineers of the 17th and 18th centuries. Drainage schemes were first authorised during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, but from 1632, a group of Adventurers took control of the drainage, in return for which they were granted land. They faced the problem that the outfalls of the River Welland and the River Glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper drainage by gravity, and most schemes included improvement to the rivers. John Perry, an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, began work in 1730, and was followed by John Grundy, Sr., a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. His son, John Grundy, Jr., was another capable engineer, who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full-time Surveyor of Works. In 1800 the civil engineers William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers with plans for improvements, the chief of which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was the largest in the Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public. From 1801 the fen was managed by trustees, appointed under the terms of an act of Parliament obtained in that year, and this remained the case until 1939 when the administrative structure was replaced by the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.  Location  Deeping Fen is a low-lying area bounded by the River Welland and the River Glen, which meet at its northern tip, covering around . It was originally an extra-parochial liberty, as it was formed of waste land which had previously belonged to a number of other parishes, but because it had been reclaimed by Adventurers, was free from land tax and ecclesiastical tithes. About half of the fen became the parish of Deeping St Nicholas in 1846, which became a civil parish in reforms authorised by an act of Parliament of 1856. The name of the fen is derived from the Old English 'Deoping', which means a \\"deep or Low place\\". The village was listed as \\"Estdeping\\" in the Domesday Book, an inventory of the country compiled in 1086. History People of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James, together with other villages along the River Welland, presented a petition to Elizabeth I, requesting that the fens should be drained, as the banks of the river and of the neighbouring River Glen were in a poor state of repair. They suggested that Thomas Lovell should undertake the work, which he did, at a cost of ¬£12,000, for which he received of the land which was reclaimed as a result of the work. Unrest in the early 1600s resulted in most of the works being destroyed, but in 1632 a group of adventurers led by the Earl of Bedford were granted permission to drain Deeping Fen, South Fen and Croyland. The work included making the Welland deeper and wider from Deeping St James to its outfall beyond Spalding, and the construction of side drains. These included a drain running from Pode Hole to below Spalding, which is still known as Vernatt's Drain, after one of the adventurers called Sir Philibert Vernatti. Although declared completed in 1637, efficient drainage would have to wait until the construction of Pode Hole pumping station in 1827. The drainage of the fen was again addressed in 1664, when the Deeping Fen Act awarded the Earl of Manchester and others of land in return for the drainage works. They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the Welland. The inadequacy of its outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion that the only way to improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of scouring sluices on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt's drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly in payment for the work. He sold one third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730. Cowbit sluice on the Welland had six wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel. At high tide, water was penned in Cowbit Wash, between banks which were set well back from the main channel. At low tide, the sluice gates were opened, and the flow scoured out silt from the river bed for some downstream. Perry died in February 1733, before the other works were completed, and was buried in Spalding churchyard. =Scientific Drainage= Perry was succeeded by John Grundy, Sr., who had arrived in the region in 1731 at the request of the Duke of Buccleuch, who wanted his estates surveyed. Perry was building the Spalding sluice at the time, and Grundy's work allowed him to study drains, banks, sluices and outfalls. He formed the opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to the drainage of low-lying regions. In 1733, he surveyed the parish of Moulton, a little further downstream, to assess how drainage could be improved for the Commissioners of Sewers. He demonstrated the use of a telescopic spirit level, which enabled him to achieve accurate levels, with errors of less than 1 inch per mile (2 cm per km). Next he addressed the issue of flow in open drains. Using his mathematical principles, he calculated that water in a drain which was long, and had a fall of over its length should travel at around , taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel the length of the drain. Observations in the field showed him that other factors, such as fluid friction, resulted in the actual flow rate being less than half of this. He published a paper of his findings in April 1734, and insisted that accurate mapping and levels, together with physical observation of drains and rivers, were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained. In the same month, he began working for the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, to produce a drainage scheme. He spent some time mapping of the Welland, and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at the outfall of the River Glen, which would enable the outfall to be scoured at low tide, by releasing water from the reservoir. In July 1737 Grundy and Humphry Smith set out their plans for the fen, and a bill was put before Parliament, to allow the Adventurers to raise the ¬£15,000 estimated cost by taxes. The act was granted in 1738, and Smith and Grundy were appointed \\"Surveyors and Agents of Deeping Fen.\\" They oversaw a programme of repairs to the Deeping Bank, which ran for along the south-eastern edge of the fen, protecting it from the Welland. John Scribo did the same for the Country Bank, which ran for on the far side of the river. Grundy made the river deeper above Spalding, and also constructed a sluice and reservoir at the mouth of the Glen. The reservoir covered and provided water to scour the channel below the sluice. Two drainage mills were constructed, each with a scoop wheel, one on Vernatt's Drain and the other on Hill's Drain. The bed of the Glen had also been regraded and its banks raised by 1742, when Smith retired and Grundy took sole charge of the works. He oversaw the job of making the Welland through Spalding deeper and wider, and suggested that the outfall of Vernatt's Drain should be moved downstream from its existing position. Although not implemented immediately, his son completed this task in 1774. Grundy died in 1748, having been a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. =Civil Engineers= John Grundy, Jr., took over as Surveyor of Works after the death of his father in 1748, and spent nearly ¬£10,000 on repairs to the Deeping Bank and the Country bank between then and 1764. He rebuilt Perry's sluice on the Welland soon after 1750, with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent the tide moving upstream. In 1755 three more drainage mills were built on Hills Drain, while a sluice on the Forty Foot Drain followed in 1758. From 1759 to 1761 he was engaged in lowering the bed of the Welland below the outfall sluice by . After 1764, Thomas Hogard became the Surveyor of Works, but Grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer. Hogard devised a scheme to cut a new channel from the junction of the Welland and the Glen to Wyberton, on the estuary of the River Witham below Boston. At the end of the cut, there would be a huge sluice and a navigation lock. The Adventurers asked Thomas Tofield for a second opinion, who suggested a shorter cut from Spalding to Fosdyke. They requested help from Grundy, who proposed a cut to Fosdyke, and that the outfall of Vernatt's drain should be moved downstream as his father had suggested. Improvements to the drain were carried out under an act of Parliament obtained in 1774, and an act was obtained in 1794 to sanction the Wyberton cut, although the work was not carried out, and Grundy's shorter cut was built under a new act of 1801. The fen was inundated in 1798, and the civil engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which formed the basis for the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented. =Pumping Stations= After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The land which formed the North Drove was at a lower level to that in the South Drove, and so it was intended to keep the water at different levels in each drain, so that a less powerful engine could be built to pump the South Drove Drain. By the time the details had been finalised, engines of and were ordered. Both engines were beam engines. The larger one was manufactured by Butterley, was called the Holland engine, and drove a scoop wheel which was in diameter. The wheel had 40 scoops and lifted the water by . The smaller engine, which was called the Kesteven engine, was made by Fenton & Murrey, and drove a similar scoop wheel. They were operational by August 1825, having cost ¬£26,673. The pumping station was the largest in the Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Upgrading of the plant occurred several times. The Kesteven and Holland engines were overhauled in 1881 and 1883 respectively. Flow into the wheel pits was restricted by the provision of shuttles, and rising breasts were fitted on the outflow, so that the height at which the water was discharged could be varied as the water level in Vernatt's drain varied. Five new boilers, which could supply either engine, were fitted in 1883, and had been replaced by five more some time before 1928, for the new boilers failed in that year. The Kesteven engine had its scoop wheel removed, although the rest of the plant was not scrapped until 1952. Two twin-cylinder diesel engines were installed to aid the steam plant, the first in 1914 and the second in 1920. They were made by Mirrlees, and were scrapped in 1956. Following the demise of the steam engines, a Mirrlees five- cylinder diesel engine, which drove a pump was obtained. The first electric pump was installed in 1939, to be joined by three more in 1957, once the Mirrlees engines had been decommissioned. A new engine house was built in 1964, which held two Ruston diesel engines driving Gwynnes Limited pumps, and a third Ruston unit, fitted with a Gwynnes pump. The remaining Mirrlees engine and the first electric pump were scrapped at this time. =Other Districts= Pinchbeck South Fen is a region covering lying on the west side of Vernatt's Drain. It was originally managed as the Fourth District by the Deeping Fen trustees, but was independent in 1828, when the occupants approached the trustees with a plan to drain some of the water from the fen to the Pode Hole pumps. A tunnel already existed under Vernatt's drain, and so the trustees agreed. However, the charges levied by the trustees for this service rose dramatically, so that the South Fen residents decided to build their own pumping engine at Pode Hole in 1830. A Fenton & Murray beam engine driving a scoop wheel was installed, at a cost of ¬£3,000, which was considerably less than the charge the trustees wanted to make. The engine was replaced by a suction gas engine and Ruston pump in 1919, which was decommissioned in 1943 when a Petter oil engine with a Gwynnes pump was installed. This only lasted for ten years, as two electric motors driving and pumps were fitted in 1953. Pinchbeck Marsh was also part of Deeping Fen, but following the failure of the work carried out under the 1801 Act to effectively drain the area, an act of Parliament was obtained in 1832 to create a separate district, called the Spalding and Pinchbeck District, or Blue Gowt, as water from the feeds into the River Glen from the Blue Gowt Drain. A Butterley beam engine driving a scoop wheel was installed in 1833. Although a new boiler was installed in 1895, the engine and wheel continued to operate until 1952, making it the last beam engine and scoop wheel combination to be used in the Fens, and also the one which ran for the longest time. Its function was replaced by the two electric pumps fitted in 1953, which also pump the Pinchbeck South Fen, but the plant was retained, and is now open to the public, although the steam engine is now turned by an electric motor. The management of Deeping Fen by trustees, appointed under the terms of the 1801 Act, continued until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, which became part of the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board, when it amalgamated with three other local internal drainage boards in 1973.

It focused on both the physical and human geography features of the European continent and especially on Southeastern Europe, and is considered one of the most remarkable works of the modern Greek Enlightenment. The authors of the Geographia Neoteriki adopted new geographical methodologies for that time, which were primarily based on personal examination of the described areas and used as sources a number of contemporary European handbooks. The work, written in a vernacular language, also described the contemporary social developments and expressed ideas that were considered revolutionary and anticlerical, and addressed the political and economic decay of the Ottoman Empire. Geographia Neoteriki was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectual circles, especially in France, but on the other hand, it was largely neglected by Greek scholars.Kopeƒçek (2006), pp. 76-77 Background A category of historical and geographical literature, focused on regional history and geography, emerged during the 18th century among Greek scholars. This kind of literature combined the collection of ethnographic data with a conviction in geography's moral and religious purpose. Major representatives of this field were two scholars and clerics, Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas. They came from the village of Milies in Thessaly, modern Greece, and were nicknamed Dimitrieis, from the ancient name of their birthplace (Dimitrias). Both scholars were active members of the Greek diaspora in the Danubian Principalities, in modern Romania, where they studied and taught at the courts of the Greek Orthodox Phanariot and the Princely Academies of Bucharest and Ia≈üi. This environment offered in general a special attraction for ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to the enlightenment of their nation. Philippidis' and Konstantas' work Geographia Neoteriki, published in Vienna in 1791, belongs to a body of contemporary texts which strove to map out the European parts of the Ottoman Empire and Greece in particular. Content This work was the first and only volume by Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas, and their intention was not only to define and describe the lands that were populated by Greeks, but also to describe the current social developments in the wider region. With this work they gave a precise delimitation of European Hellas (Greece) of that time, a few decades before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821). According to their description this area would not only include present-day Greece, but also Albania, North Macedonia and the southern half of Bulgaria, an area that included all the areas ruled by the Macedonian Kings, in addition to those of classical Greece incorporating most of the Orthodox populations of the Balkan peninsula, which was during that time under Ottoman rule. They concluded that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location at the crossroads of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights. Reflecting a new revolutionary era in the European history after the outbreak of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating the corruption of the church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome backwardness and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time. The book introduced a number of new ideas in the field of human geography and social organization models, that had been developed in the western world during the 18th century. Among the sources that the authors used to compose Geographia Neoteriki, were the G√©ographie Moderne by Nicolle de La Croix, the G√©ographie Ancienne, and the G√©ographie Moderne, which were part of the Encyclop√©die M√©thodique by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke.Kopeƒçek (2006), p. 75 Additionally, the authors had personally examined the areas described in the work. This element served both as the work's primary organizing mode as well as the basis for their historical approach. Popularity Chapter 1: Earth In general, Geographia Neoteriki, was welcomed with enthusiasm by western intellectual circles. Jean- Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, used it as a textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. Fran√ßois Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron mentioned this work, and used it as a source of information.Kopeƒçek (2006), p. 76 The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model. On the other hand, especially due to the vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook.Kopeƒçek (2006), p. 77 It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It is worth noting that the work's linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century. References Sources * External links * ŒìŒµœâŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± ŒùŒµœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ.

Sortito was a pioneer in product tie-ins in movies. An example of one of the first product tie-ins was in the movie E.T. In the story, the stranded alien character, E.T. was lured out of hiding with a trail of Reese's Pieces. Karen Sortito was born in New Haven, Connecticut. Her father, John, worked for the New Haven Parking Authority; her mother, Phyllis, was a bookkeeper. Sortito was a graduate of Southern Connecticut State University where she worked at the fledgling cable channel MTV. While there she rose to director of marketing and promotion. Later, Sortito moved from New York to Los Angeles in the late 1980s. While in Los Angeles, she worked for 20th Century Fox, MGM/UA among other Hollywood film companies. While there she earned a reputation for being a brash, intelligent and forthright character. Sortito came to prominence in 1995 when she created the BMW product tie-in for the James Bond film GoldenEye. The BMW car, a Z3, was a new model at the time. Afterwards, while the film was number one at the box office, sales of the car spiked. For the next film in the Bond franchise, Tomorrow Never Dies, Sortito created a $100 million promotional campaign that included tie-ins with Visa, L'Or√©al, Ericsson, Heineken, Avis rental cars and Omega watches. This time the film brought in more than $300 million but the product placements were criticized. Sortito defended the product placements. \\"It's all cool and hip. If this wasn't creative, we would not be doing it.\\" Sortito was used to contributing outlandish ideas. She once suggested a Bond tie-in to the lingerie maker Victoria‚Äôs Secret, in which an actress would be clad in a diamond-studded bra that also happened to spray nerve gas. \\"I thought it was campy, the filmmakers thought it was crass,\\" Sortito said of the idea. Most recently Sortito was head of the entertainment division of NYC and Company, New York city's marketing and tourism organization. She created promotions to coincide with the 2007 release of Spider-Man 3 and a celebration of the 40th anniversary of Sesame Street in 2009.
