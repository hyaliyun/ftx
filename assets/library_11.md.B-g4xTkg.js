The members originate from Tokyo, and initially formed in June 2003. The founding members are Jyou, Naoto, and Mally, who met Miko and Omi after placing an advertisement for guitarists.exist‚Ä†trace on JaME Retrieved on Sep 21, 2007 (English) To date, Exist Trace has released four albums, eight EPs, and nine singles. In addition, the band has appeared on eleven compilation albums and three omnibus DVDs, plus their self-released 2012 concert DVD Just Like a Virgin. Exist Trace made their U.S. debut at Sakura-Con 2011 in Seattle, Washington. On June 15, 2011, they made their major label debut on Tokuma Japan Communications with the EP True. Their song \\"I Feel You\\" was featured in Nadeshiko Japan's official 2012 guidebook DVD. Their highest charting release was Virgin, which reached number 84 on the Oricon album chart. Biography =Members= *Lead vocals : Jyou („Ç∏„Éß„Ç¶) *Lead guitar : Omi (‰πôÈ≠Ö) *Rhythm guitar, vocals : Miko („Éü„Ç≥) *Bass : Naoto (Áå∂‰∫∫) *Drums : Mally („Éû„É™) =Musical style and direction= Exist Trace's early music can be described as melodic death metal, with vocalist Jyou's growls and shouts throughout many songs, which contributes to their dark undertone. They have since added more complex sounds to the compositions, their guitar sound often featuring heavy distortion and technically virtuoso riffs and solos. The lyrics are mainly based on gothic themes, and their music style has resemblance to gothic rock. In recent work, they have experimented with different electronic and melodic approaches to their music, such as the jazz-influenced \\"Ginger\\", the electronic rock of \\"Diamond\\" and the '80s disco feel of \\"Spiral Daisakusen\\". =Career= In 2013, Exist Trace introduced their 'new world' musical direction, where long-time main lyricist/composer miko would officially be taking a dual-vocal position with Jyou. The twin vocal style was emphasized on 2013's single \\"Diamond\\". In 2014's \\"Spiral Daisakusen\\", the pair again share front billing and the center spot on the music video. The first album to fully incorporate the twin vocal style, World Maker (2014), revealed an improved duet system, where vocals are typically heavier towards Jyou in allocation, but making good use of miko's sweeter counterbalance. In 2016, the band released the This Is Now mini-album, which included re-recorded versions of the singles \\"Twin Wings\\" and \\"Shout Out\\", which had been previously released as live-show-only CDs. In Japan, the This Is Now EP sold out within a day, across such stores as ZEAL LINK, Disk Union and BRAND-X. On July 29, 2020, Exist Trace released the EP The Only Garden. =International acclaim= Over time, the band has developed a dedicated international following, largely by word of mouth. In 2008, Exist Trace embarked on a tour of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The band also traveled to the US, playing Japanese culture conventions Sakura-Con in 2011, Tekkoshocon X in 2012, and A-Kon in 2013. =Official fan club= 2014 brought the introduction of the band's official international fan club, 'Archangel Diamond', to act as a supplement to the Japanese fan club 'Vanguard'. The club became an active presence on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, featuring fan artworks and responding to fan questions. It officially opened for membership on May 19, 2014, the 19th of each month being generally used for Exist Trace announcements as it is 'Igu day'/„Ç§„Ç∞„ÅÆÊó• ( Japanese wordplay on the shortened form of the band's name). Archangel Diamond promised to connect international fans more closely with the band, and offered fan club exclusive merchandise, special prices on merchandise, monthly newsletters with messages from the band members, and special contests and interactions with the band. As of late 2017, the club changed its identification to \\"International Support Team\\", and ceased paid activities but continues to post English updates.

He won the British Rally Championship with a Ford Escort RS1800 in 1977 and with an Opel Manta 400 in 1985.Daily Express page 4 Monday 16 September 1985 In 1978, he won the Rally New Zealand, a round of the FIA Cup for Drivers, the predecessor to the World Championship for Drivers. In the World Rally Championship, he finished on the podium of his home event, the RAC Rally, three times in a row from 1977 to 1979. Career The only son of a firefighter, Brookes made his competitive debut in club events in 1963. At first he drove a number of privately entered cars including a BMC Mini Cooper. Progress was slow until 1973 without the support of family money in a sport which, at that time, did not permit sponsorship of individual cars. He then came to the attention of the Ford Motor Company Ltd when contesting their Ford Escort Mexico (One Make) championship.Autosport page 9 OBITUARY RUSSELL BROOKES 7 November 2019 Motorsport Network (2019) ISSN 0269-946X Brookes prior to the 1982 Scottish Rally. Brookes' Opel Manta 400 lining up before the 1986 Scottish. In 1974, Brookes started one of the longest running sponsorship deals in motorsport when he signed with Andrews - Heat for Hire (a portable heating and air conditioning company). Their distinctive yellow colour scheme graced nearly all of his cars through to 1991. During this period the sponsors' turnover grew from ¬£1.5m to over ¬£60m making it a benchmark for other sponsorship deals. In 1976, Brookes was invited to join the Ford 'works' team to drive an Escort RS1800 in the British Rally Championship.Motorsport News page 19 OBITUARY RUSSELL BROOKES Wednesday 6 November 2019 Autosport Media UK Ltd (2019) At that time the British Championship was highly competitive having eclipsed the World Rally Championship for publicity. Brookes found himself in formidable company not least from within the team, Bj√∂rn Waldeg√•rd, Hannu Mikkola and Ari Vatanen (all world champions), being his team-mates. He won the Open Championship in 1977 and then stayed with Ford until the end of the 1979 World Rally Championship season. Two years in the Talbot team followed before he joined Vauxhall/Opel dealer team, first in the Chevette HSR then the mighty Group B Opel Manta 400. The two years with the Opel Manta put Brookes head to head with his team mate Jimmy McRae (father of the late world champion Colin McRae). The needle match contest was more about the unofficial title of 'Top British Driver' than the championship itself. McRae won in 1984 and Brookes in 1985. The intensity of the contest lives in the memory of enthusiasts to this day. After a year in the uncompetitive Vauxhall Astra and a one off event in a 'works' Lancia Delta Integrale Brookes rejoined Ford in 1988 for an assault on the British Rally Championship, championing first a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth. Latterly he drove a Ford Sapphire Cosworth 4x4 giving Ford their first international win with the new four wheel drive car. Here he stayed until the end of 1991 when he more or less retired from competitive rallying. Until shortly before his death, he was still making sporadic appearances in various cars on historic rallies and at motorsports events. In September 2008, Brookes took part in the Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally, a round of the Scottish Rally Championship centred in Perth in Scotland. He competed the event in a historic Ford Escort RS1600. He was one of a number of ex-world and British champions to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007. Brookes died on 30 October 2019, at the age of 74 from injuries sustained from a bicycle accident.

He was one of many Jewish actors and actresses who were forced to flee Europe when the Nazis came to power in 1933. Biography St√∂ssel began performing on the stage in Austria and Germany when he was only 17. He soon became a successful character actor and performed on the most prestigious stages in Germany, among them the Max Reinhardt, the stage and the in Berlin. St√∂ssel later became a movie actor. His first motion picture was a small role in the silent movie In der Heimat, da gibt's ein Wiedersehn! (We'll Meet Again in the Heimat) in 1926 at the age of 43. He appeared in about a half dozen silent movies in Germany and landed more roles with the arrival of sound. St√∂ssel's first sound movie was Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Skandal um Eva ((Scandalous Eva)) in 1930. The following year, he appeared in Max Neufeld's Opernredoute (The Opera Ball). Later that year, he appeared as a hotel owner in the German comedy Die Koffer des Herrn O.F. (The Suitcases of Mr. O.F.), starring Peter Lorre and Hedy Lamarr. In 1932, he appeared as Riederer in Der Rebell (The Rebel). In 1933, St√∂ssel had a small part in Fritz Lang's famous mystery thriller Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (The Testament of Dr. Mabuse), a film that was later banned by the Nazi government. His appearance in Carl Boese's 1933 comedy Heimkehr ins Gl√ºck (Homecoming to Happiness) would be his last movie in Germany. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, St√∂ssel was forced to leave Germany because of his Jewish background. He returned to Austria and appeared in a few movies, but he concentrated on the theater. In 1934, he appeared in the comedy Eine Nacht in Venedig (A Night in Venice). His last movie in Austria was in 1937 with Pfarrer von Kirchfeld (The Priest from Kirchfeld). After Hitler's forces took over Austria in the Anschlu√ü of 1938, St√∂ssel was imprisoned several times before he was able to escape Vienna and get to Paris. He and his wife, Lore Birn, eventually reached London. He appeared in Dead Man's Shoes and another British film production before heading to Hollywood in 1939.Ludwig Stossel, second cabin Passenger List, S/S Vandyke, ex Liverpool, England, 1 September; arrived Port of New York, 13 September 1939. St√∂ssel made his American movie debut in 1940, playing a pastor in Czechoslovakia during the Nazi takeover in the wartime drama Four Sons, starring Don Ameche. In 1942, he appeared with Ilka Gr√ºning in Underground. St√∂ssel and Gr√ºnig were reunited in the Oscar-nominated Kings Row, starring Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains. St√∂ssel and Gr√ºnig also appeared together in the Sonja Henie film Iceland. Later that year, St√∂ssel was cast to play Lou Gehrig's father in Pride of the Yankees starring Gary Cooper in the title role. A few months later, at the age of 59, he played Mr. Leuchtag, who is leaving Europe for America with his wife in Casablanca. St√∂ssel appeared in supporting roles in over 40 movies after Casablanca, most in the following ten years. The next year, he had a small role in another Humphrey Bogart movie, Action in the North Atlantic. He did a couple of anti- Nazi movies, such as Hitler's Madman (1943), in which he portrayed the mayor of a small town that is wiped out by a Nazi mass execution in reprisal for the assassination of SS Commander Reinhard Heydrich. Later that year, he appeared in The Strange Death of Adolf Hitler. In 1944, he appeared in the Boris Karloff horror movie The Climax. Later in 1944, St√∂ssel teamed up with his movie wife from Pride of the Yankees, Elsa Janssen, to play Mr. and Mrs. Steelman, a German couple loyal to America who drive their traitorous pro-Nazi son, played by George Sanders (who is actually working undercover for the U.S. government), out of their house in the spy drama They Came to Blow Up America. In 1945, they teamed up again to play Mr. and Mrs. Otto in the \\"B\\" crime drama Dillinger. Next, he was bitten in the throat by Count Dracula, played by John Carradine, in House of Dracula. Later in 1945, St√∂ssel played a teacher, who along with a llama, is in the opening scene of the Fred Astaire musical Yolanda and the Thief. When the Second World War ended in 1945, St√∂ssel decided not to return to Germany like many other German actors and actresses, but remained in his adopted country making movies. In 1946, Gr√ºnig and St√∂ssel got to play husband and wife again in Temptation starring Merle Oberon, George Brent and Paul Lukas. In 1947, he had a small role portraying Albert Einstein in The Beginning or the End. In 1948, he portrayed one of the lonely bachelor professors at a musical research institute in the Danny Kaye musical A Song is Born. In 1949, Gr√ºnig and St√∂ssel appeared in their last film together when they received roles in the drama The Great Sinner, starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. In 1953, St√∂ssel played a grand duke in the musical Call Me Madam, starring Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor. His last film was in 1960, where he had a small role in the Elvis Presley movie G.I. Blues. St√∂ssel also performed on television. In 1955, he played Ludwig, a Carl the waiter clone, in the television version of Casablanca. He made two guest appearances on Perry Mason during the series' second season, including the role of Adolph Van Beers in \\"The Case of the Shattered Dream.\\" From 1958 to 1960, St√∂ssel played Charles Bronson's father in ABC's television series Man with a Camera. From 1953 to 1963, St√∂ssel appeared as a guest in a number of television shows, including Cavalcade of America, My Three Sons, The Donna Reed Show, and The New Phil Silvers Show (where he parodied his Gallo wine television commercials). He guest-starred in two Robert Young series, the situation comedy Father Knows Best and the comedy-drama series Window on Main Street. St√∂ssel became famous for a long series of commercials for Italian Swiss Colony wine producers. Dressed in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, he was their spokesman. His motto was \\"That Little Old Winemaker, Me!\\" (they did not use his voice, but had Jim Backus dub the line). St√∂ssel died on January 29, 1973 in Beverly Hills after a fall just 14 days short of his 90th birthday. He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, with the ashes sent to Vienna, Austria.

The circular establishes guidelines for the management of digital spatial data and the use of those assets. It also appoints the FGDC to the interagency coordinating body for NSDI-related activities. The Secretary of the Interior is established as chair, with the Deputy Director for Management, OMB as Vice- Chair.  National Spatial Data Infrastructure  The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) ensures that spatial information is accurate and available to state, local, and tribal governments as well as to academia and the private sector. The NSDI obeys four primary values: * Privacy and Security of raw and processed citizens' personal data and accuracy of statistical data * Access to these data per guidelines subject to OMB Circular A-130 * Protection of proprietary interests to these data * Interoperability between various federal agencies' information systems within these data The NSDI supports the advancement for a Global Spatial Data Infrastructure that coincides with National Security interests. Any Federal system that develops international data in accordance with these systems must follow international voluntary standards as outlined by Circular A-119. The NSDI has five parts: * Data themes * Metadata * National Spatial Data Clearinghouse * Technical standards * Partnerships  Spatial Data  Spatial Data is considered a national capital asset. The NSDI manages the distribution of these assets across all interconnected systems, federal and private sector, and analyzes it to determine the impact of the world economically, physically and socially upon the United States. Part of NSDI's mission is to help avoid duplication or erroneous modification of this spatial data. Accurate and dependable spatial data allows NSDI to analyze current situational trends such as weather patterns, traffic congestions, and other various infrastructures to create a national snapshot in order to make predictions or projections based on these data. Federal Geographic Data Committee  The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is an interagency committee delegated to manage OMB Circular A-16 related activities and implementation of NSDI policy and procedures in accordance with existing federal law and policy. The Department of the Interior provides administrative support to the FGDC when necessary in the event of enforcement of the structure and bylaws mentioned in this circular. Circular policy Any agency that collects, produces, acquires, maintains, distributes, uses, or preserves any form of spatial data either directly or indirectly with any other agency or organization must follow the policies set forth by the circular. The following exemplary list is representative of the kinds of systems to which the circular applies: * the National Mapping Program * the National Spatial Reference System * the National Geologic Mapping Program * the National Wetlands Inventory * the National Cooperative Soil Survey Program * the National Public Land Survey System * Geographic Coordinate Database * the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charting and nautical data collection and information programs * the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) inland waterway charting program * the Offshore Minerals Program * the NASA's Earth Science Enterprise * the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Plain Mapping program and other federal activities that involve national surveying, mapping, remote sensing, spatially referenced statistical data * Global Positioning System (GPS) There are few exemptions to adherence to the policy described in the circular: * spatial data related to tribal governments not paid for with federal funds * classified national-security related activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), unless declassified by Executive Order 12951 (under direction of the Secretary of Defense) * those activities of the Department of Energy under determination of the Secretary of Energy * intelligence spatial data activities, under determination of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Agency responsibility Every agency that uses NSDI information must adhere to a set of responsibilities as outlined by the circular.

The family members in humans are PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX3, PRDX4, PRDX5, and PRDX6. The physiological importance of peroxiredoxins is illustrated by their relative abundance (one of the most abundant proteins in erythrocytes after hemoglobin is peroxiredoxin 2).  Classification  Prxs were historically divided into three (mechanistic) classes: *Typical 2-Cys Prxs *Atypical 2-Cys Prxs and *1-Cys Prxs. The designation of \\"1-Cys\\" and \\"2-Cys\\" Prxs was introduced in 1994 as it was noticed that, among the 22 Prx sequences known at the time, only one Cys residue was absolutely conserved; this is the residue now recognized as the (required) peroxidatic cysteine, CP. The second, semi- conserved cysteine noted at the time is the resolving cysteine, CR, which forms an intersubunit disulfide bond with CP in the widespread and abundant Prxs sometimes referred to as the \\"typical 2-Cys Prxs\\". Ultimately it was realized that the CR can reside in multiple positions in various Prx family members, leading to the addition of the \\"atypical 2-Cys Prx\\" category (Prxs for which a CR is present, but not in the \\"typical\\", originally identified position). With the large amount of information currently available regarding Prx structures and sequences, family members are now recognized to fall into six classes or subgroups, designated as Prx1 (essentially synonymous with \\"typical 2-Cys\\"), Prx5, Prx6, PrxQ, Tpx and AhpE groups. It is now recognized that the existence and location of CR across all 6 groups is heterogeneous. Thus, even though the \\"1-Cys Prx\\" designation was originally associated with the Prx6 group based on the lack of a CR in human PrxVI, and many Prx6 group members appear not to have a CR, there are \\"1-Cys\\" members in all of the subgroups. Moreover, the CR can be located in 5 (known) locations in the structure, yielding either an intersubunit or intrasubunit disulfide bond in the oxidized protein (depending on CR location). To assist with identification of new members and the subgroup to which they belong, a searchable database (the PeroxiRedoxin classification indEX) including Prx sequences identified from GenBank (January 2008 through October 2011) was generated by bioinformatics analysis and is publicly available.  Catalytic cycle  These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. The recycling of the sulfenic acid back to a thiol is what distinguishes the three enzyme classes. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are reduced by thiols such as thioredoxins, thioredoxin-like proteins, or possibly glutathione, while the 1-Cys enzymes may be reduced by ascorbic acid or glutathione in the presence of GST-œÄ. Using high resolution crystal structures, a detailed catalytic cycle has been derived for Prxs, including a model for the redox-regulated oligomeric state proposed to control enzyme activity. Inactivation of these enzymes by over-oxidation (also known as hyperoxidation) of the active thiol to sulfinic acid can be reversed by sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins are frequently referred to as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) in bacteria. Other names include thiol specific antioxidant (TSA) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). Mammals express six peroxiredoxins: * 1-Cys enzymes: PRDX6 (in the Prx6 group) * 2-Cys enzymes: PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX3, PRDX4 (all four in the Prx1 group), and PRDX5 (in the Prx5 group) Enzyme regulation Peroxiredoxins can be regulated by phosphorylation, redox status such as sulfonation, acetylation, nitration, truncation and oligomerization states.  Function  Peroxiredoxin uses thioredoxin (Trx) to recharge after reducing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the following reactions: * Prx(reduced) + H2O2 ‚Üí Prx(oxidized) + 2H2O * Prx(oxidized) + Trx(reduced) ‚Üí Prx(reduced) + Trx(oxidized) The oxidized form of Prx is inactive in its reductase activity, but can function as a molecular chaperon, requiring the donation of electrons from reduced Trx to restore its catalytic activity. The physiological importance of peroxiredoxins is illustrated by their relative abundance (one of the most abundant proteins in erythrocytes after hemoglobin is peroxiredoxin 2) as well as studies in knockout mice. Mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 develop severe haemolytic anemia, and are predisposed to certain haematopoietic cancers. Peroxiredoxin 1 knockout mice have a 15% reduction in lifespan. Peroxiredoxin 6 knockout mice are viable and do not display obvious gross pathology, but are more sensitive to certain exogenous sources of oxidative stress, such as hyperoxia. Peroxiredoxin 3 (mitochondrial matrix peroxiredoxin) knockout mice are viable and do not display obvious gross pathology. Peroxiredoxins are proposed to play a role in cell signaling by regulating H2O2 levels. Plant 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts, where they protect the photosynthetic membrane against photooxidative damage. Nuclear gene expression depends on chloroplast- to-nucleus signalling and responds to photosynthetic signals, such as the acceptor availability at photosystem II and ABA.  Circadian clock  Peroxiredoxins have been implicated in the 24-hour internal circadian clock of many organisms.

Makana is a Hawaiian language term meaning gift or reward. It is often used as a person's name or as part of a name. Limahuli Garden and Preserve preserves the valley below. It was featured in the 1958 film adaptation of the musical South Pacific as Bali Hai, a name that is still used to this day. Makana Mountain is one of only two locations where the fire- throwing ceremony, ≈çahi, was performed in ancient Hawaiian times. The ≈çahi was a celebration of very special occasions such as the graduation of students from the hƒÅlau hula (hula school) at Kƒìƒì or the visit of an alii (high chief). On the day of the ceremony, skilled firethrowers climbed the steep cliffs to the very top of Makana Mountain laden with light, dry logs of pƒÅpala (Charpentiera spp.) or hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus). When night fell, they set the logs afire and hurled them out over the ocean. Ridge lifts created by trade winds hitting the sheer cliff of Makana kept the firebrands aloft, soaring as far as out to sea. The result was a night sky filled with sparks and fiery torches tracing long arcs of light. It is sometimes called \\"Fireworks Cliff\\". People in canoes would crowd the ocean below Makana, trying to catch the firebrands. It was considered heroic to catch the flaming embers, and those who succeeded would often mark themselves with the fire in honor of the occasion. Couples who caught the firebrands would both mark themselves in the same way, as a sign of love and commitment. The practice ended in the 19th century, with the last ceremony having been in honor of Queen Emma.

Neurophysin II is a cleavage product (formed by splitting of a compound molecule into a simpler one) of the prepro-vasopressin. It is a neurohypophysial hormone that is transported in vesicles with vasopressin, the other cleavage product, along axons, from magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus to the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Although it is stored in neurosecretory granules with vasopressin and released with vasopressin into the bloodstream, its biological action is unclear. Neurophysin II is also known as a stimulator of prolactin secretion.  Function  Neurophysin II is a carrier protein for vasopressin (ADH). It is produced in the cell bodies of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and transported to its site of release in the axon terminals of the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin, a hormone similar in structure to vasopressin, is analogously bound and transported by Neurophysin I. Both hormones are nine residues long, and only differ by the amino acids at positions three and eight. Oxytocin possesses Ile-3 whereas vasopressin possesses Phe-3. Both Ile and Phe are hydrophobic amino acids and undergo analogous binding to neurophysins.  Structure  Neurophysin II is a dimer with each monomer consisting of two anti-parallel Œ≤-sheets. Each chain is identical with the exception of a single amino acid substitution (Chain 1 contains Lys-18, whereas chain 2 contains Ala-18).

In an attempt to corner the local market on gas stations, Dhinsa defrauded customers, evaded taxes, committed at least two murders, and is believed to have ordered eight others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in a federal prison. Early life Dhinsa was born a Sikh in Punjab, India, and emigrated to the Bronx in 1982. He worked as a car-wash attendant until he was able to purchase a filling station of his own. As business improved, Dhinsa's holding company, Citygas Gasoline Corp Entity Information for Citygas Gasoline Corp., New York State Department of State Division of Corporations \\"City Gas\\" opened more stations in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. At its height, City Gas had 51 locations and 300 employees, with annual revenues of $100 million. Criminal activities When Dhinsa leased his first gas station in 1984, neighborhood residents were illegally using the lot to park their cars. According to a witness, Dhinsa smashed every windshield with a baseball bat. The cars were moved, and the gas station became profitable. As he expanded his business, Dhinsa modified gas pumps, evaded taxes on gasoline bought in bulk, and kept his employees silent with death threats. He was arrested in 1990 on suspicion of kidnapping, robbery, and assault, but served only 90 days by pleading guilty to a weapons charge. In 1993, he was convicted of weapons charges again and served a year in prison. In July 1995, Dhinsa ordered associates to kidnap an employee he suspected of stealing. When the victim's brother came looking for him in early 1997, Dhinsa ordered his murder. This killing was reported to police by several residents of the neighborhood. Police discovered that Dhinsa's brother Gurdip, who had fled to India to avoid prosecution for a 1991 murder, was back in the U.S. and was working at City Gas. On May 16, 1997, police surrounded the City Gas headquarters and arrested three employees, including Gurdip. When Gurmeet Dhinsa arrived at the scene, he was held for questioning and released. Although Dhinsa was released, a task force was formed to look into his operation, including the investigation of several disappearances and unsolved homicides. The kidnapped employee was never found. On July 1, 1997, police were called by a man who claimed Dhinsa had threatened him and his family. Later that day, investigators stopped Dhinsa and searched the car he was driving. When Dhinsa opened the trunk, the police discovered circuit boards for gas pumps.This evidence, along with other evidence obtained from Dhinsa's car, was suppressed during pretrial motions due to doubts of probable cause. Dhinsa claimed that the traffic stop was unconstitutional, and that the seizure of his car six days later constituted an unreasonable search. This decision was overturned before trial; see \\"Docket No. 98-1605\\" from U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. Arrest and trial Police arrested Dhinsa on 7 July 1997. At the same time, Dhinsa's car was seized and inventoried. Evidence of gas pump tampering, including Department of Consumer Affairs metal seals and inspection stickers, was found during the search. On 22 August 1997, Dhinsa was indicted by a grand jury on 29 counts including racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and witness intimidation. Dhinsa was represented by high-profile defense attorney Gerald Shargel, but was found guilty of murder and racketeering after an eight-week trial. Although the prosecution sought the death penalty, the jury turned down the request and Dhinsa was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In addition, Dhinsa was forced to pay $1.75 million in restitution and fines--$625,000 to the family of each victim as well as a separate $500,000 fine to the city--and his businesses were auctioned by the government to cover civil fines. Dhinsa is currently serving a life sentence at FCI Schuylkill.53546053 - BOP Find an inmate(07/21/2018)  Television  The story of the police investigation and prosecution of Dhinsa is the subject of an episode of The FBI Files entitled \\"Deadly Business\\" (Season 3, Episode 9).

It is said that the novels' characters, Aasha Rani and her lover Akshay, were based on the real life love- affairs of Amitabh Bachchan with Rekha Ganesan and Dharmendra Singh Deol with Hema Malini. It was a best seller in India and cemented its authors reputation as being a provocative and daring author.  Plot summary  The protagonist of the book is Aasha Rani, a dark, chubby girl from Madras who has striven for seven years to become a famous Bollywood starlet. Her mother, Amma, has pushed her to attain this status by selling herself into the world of blue films before she was twelve years old, and when she was fifteen to Kishenbhai, a once-famous producer who was encouraged by Amma to take her as a lover in exchange for a film role. Kishenbhai, unable to secure a role for her any other way, finances a film with his own money after promoting her as the newest Bollywood starlet and having her sleep with the appropriate people to secure her attention and renaming her from Viji to Aasha Rani. He then proceeds to fall madly in love with her, who abandons him as she strives to get ahead in the filmi world, fully aware that she was just being used by him at first and is thus unable to return the affection of the older man. She falls in love with Akshay Arora, a famous Bollywood sex symbol who stars in a string of hits with her. Amma, who had been living with her in Mumbai, was sent away to Madras by Aasha for objecting to Akshay beating her one day. Eventually Akshay gets bored with her and after his wife confronts her unsuccessfully about her affair with her husband, he reveals to Showbiz magazine that she was a former pornographic actress, and effectively has her blackballed from making further films. When she accosts him at a society party about this, he beats her. Sheth Amirchand, a Member of Parliament and the gangster that controls most of the Mumbai underworld, then takes an interest in Aasha Rani and she becomes his lover and restarts her career under his protection. She then has an affair with Linda, a gossip columnist for Showbiz magazine and Abhijit Mehra, the son of an industrialist, who is about to be married. Linda advises her to go to the south and do an art film, which she does, where she tries to seduce the director only to find that he is impotent. Her interest in her work declines as she continue to obsess over Akshay Arora. She confronts him at a traffic light as their cars are next to each other and their affair is rekindled for a short time. She attempts to get Akshay to marry her, but when it becomes apparent that his interest in her is only due to his flagging stardom and not out of affection for her, she attempts suicide. Her lesbian lover Linda, meanwhile, writes a juicy scoop on her suicide attempt. After she recovers she rekindles her affair with Abhijit Mehra, but Malini, Akshay's wife, reports this to his father and he has his weak-willed son Abhijit cut the affair off and sends Aasha to New Zealand with instructions to keep out of Abhijit's life. Aasha then retires to New Zealand and decided to leave the film business. She marries a New Zealander named Jamie Phillips (Jay) and has a child with him. Since Jay is not Indian and not in the film business, it occurs to her that she does not have to retire once she is married as is the custom in India. It is then revealed that Akshay has succumbed to AIDS as a result of his promiscuous lifestyle. Sudha Rani claims that Jay tried to seduce her and in revenge, Aasha Rani initiates an affair with Jojo, the producer of her next film. Aasha Rani is forced out of the film industry by Jojo's wife, who sends goondahs to threaten her. She flies back to New Zealand and meets a man called Gopalakrishnan who she has sex with in the bathroom of the plane. She discovers that her husband is having an affair with her babysitter and they decide that their marriage is over. Her daughter, Sasha rejects her and begins to have her own identity crisis as a multiracial child. Aasha then meets a young lady named Shonali who she begins to spend a lot of time with. She is a London socialite and call girl and introduces Aasha to London High Society. At a party, Aasha notices Gopalakrishnan, the man she had sex with on the flight to London. He turns out to be an arms dealer. She accosts him and later he has an assassin quartered at her house and threatens to have her daughter murdered if she tells. Shonali murders the assassin and ushers Aasha Rani out of the country. Sudha Rani has meanwhile had a film financed by the mob and she begins to doctor the books instead of repaying her debts. The gangsters have her assaulted by some thugs and they set her on fire. Sudha Rani is badly burned and is forced out of the film industry, and Aasha reconciles with her. As Appa weakens, he reveals that he has kept position of a studio that Aasha can use to support herself by preparing her daughter, Sasha, to take her place as Bollywood's next starlet.

He defeated Harold Macmillan to get elected as a member of parliament, but later left Parliament to become Director of the North East Development Council for five years in the 1960s. Education Chetwynd was the son of a miner, and was brought up in north Warwickshire. An academically gifted child, he passed the Eleven plus and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Atherstone; he then won a place at King's College London where he obtained a BA (Hons.) in History and a postgraduate scholarship in the same subject. He joined the Labour Party in 1936 and earned a living by being a lecturer for the Workers Educational Association. Wartime service In 1940, during the Second World War, Chetwynd enlisted in the Royal Artillery. Two years later he was commissioned into the Royal Army Educational Corps where he trained troops; by the end of the war he held the rank of captain. At the 1945 general election, Chetwynd fought Stockton-on-Tees as the Labour Party candidate against the rising Conservative minister Harold Macmillan; in one of the first results to be declared, he won with a majority of 8,664. Parliament He made his mark in Parliament as a generally loyal supporter of the government, which was put under pressure from the left. He saw nothing inconsistent in membership of the United Nations while retaining strong armed forces for the United Kingdom. Although initially opposed to the continuation of national service in peacetime, he later came round to support it. He also spoke in favour of the Town and Country Planning Bill in 1947. In March of that year he appealed for greater efforts to build new factories on Tees-side. In March 1948 he signed an all party motion calling for a 'Council of Western Europe' to prepare the way for an organic federation of European states. Chetwynd was approached to sign a telegram to Pietro Nenni, a Communist-allied Italian socialist, but refused to have anything to do with it. Alliance with Hugh Dalton With Chetwynd being particularly close to Hugh Dalton, when Dalton returned to government in May 1948 he chose Chetwynd as his Parliamentary Private Secretary. He was a strong supporter of nationalisation of the steel industry, which was a major employer in his constituency. He retained his seat through the 1950 and 1951 general elections, and made an easy transition into opposition after 1951. Opposition politics His interest in European co- operation was marked by appointment as a delegate to the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe from 1952 to 1954. He was also a Governor of Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton and was Chair of the Governors in 1952. He was also a supporter of walking in the countryside (and went rambling with Hugh Dalton); he was a member of Nature Conservancy. In 1953, Chetwynd seconded a Private member's bill brought in by Samuel Viant which banned the sale of toy weapons; he argued that possession of these weapons \\"was a real incentive to development of the gangster mentality\\". In the late 1950s Chetwynd became more concerned with economic development in his constituency. He sponsored a private member's bill in 1957 to make Stockton-on-Tees into a County borough, but was defeated by 201 to 95. He was also concerned over problems with nuclear power stations, although supportive of nuclear power and nuclear weapons generally. He opposed government spending on space research, regarding it as \\"an attempt to keep up with the Joneses\\". North East development After the 1959 general election, Chetwynd was made an opposition spokesman on Aviation. He pressed for investment in the aviation industry, including the construction of a supersonic airliner. However, in late 1961 he was applied for and was offered the job of Director of the North East Development Council, giving him responsibility for selling the region to overseas investors. Chetwynd resigned his seat and took up the appointment in January 1962. Shortly after his appointment Chetwynd began to 'sell' the North East region by giving a press conference for American firms where he argued that France was too politically unstable and West Germany had a labour shortage. Later that year, his annual report complained that the north east had received fewer government grants for industrial development than other regions. He objected to the London-centric economy of the United Kingdom and called for better transport infrastructure to redress it. The North East Development Council made several attempts to get a personal meeting with Harold Macmillan, then Prime Minister, in 1963. He often complained about the poor public image of the north-east. Other public roles From 1964, Chetwynd began to receive other public appointments, first as a member of the General Advisory Council of the Independent Television Authority and of the North-East Advisory Committee for Civil Aviation. He was put on the Northern Economic Planning Council in the same year. Chetwynd's interest in aviation was also used on the board of the British Overseas Airways Corporation from 1966 to 1974. In 1968 he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees. Business appointments Chetwynd left the North East Development Council in February 1967 to become Deputy Chairman of the Land Commission. This appointment was part-time and allowed him to increase his business involvement: he was a Director of the Northern and Tubes Group of British Steel Corporation from 1968 and a board member of the whole British Steel Corporation group from 1970. He was Chairman of the Land Commission from 1970, an appointment intended to be for three years but actually lasted only one. A Director of the Northern Industrial Development Board from 1972, Chetwynd decreased his involvement as the 1970s went on. He moved onto the Northern Regional Health Authority as vice-chairman from 1973 to 1976, and as chairman from 1978. He was also Chairman of the Council of BBC Radio Cleveland from 1976 to 1978. He was given a Knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. He was replaced as Chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority in June 1982 by Norman Fowler shortly after criticising the Conservative government's conduct of a pay dispute, although this was said to have been a coincidence.

Most fast neutron therapy beams are produced by reactors, cyclotrons (d+Be) and linear accelerators. Neutron therapy is currently available in Germany, Russia, South Africa and the United States. In the United States, three treatment centers are operational in Seattle, Washington, Detroit, Michigan and Batavia, Illinois. The Detroit and Seattle centers use a cyclotron which produces a proton beam impinging upon a beryllium target; the Batavia center at Fermilab uses a proton linear accelerator. Advantages Radiation therapy kills cancer cells in two ways depending on the effective energy of the radiative source. The amount of energy deposited as the particles traverse a section of tissue is referred to as the linear energy transfer (LET). X-rays produce low LET radiation, and protons and neutrons produce high LET radiation. Low LET radiation damages cells predominantly through the generation of reactive oxygen species, see free radicals. The neutron is uncharged and damages cells by direct effect on nuclear structures. Malignant tumors tend to have low oxygen levels and thus can be resistant to low LET radiation. This gives an advantage to neutrons in certain situations. One advantage is a generally shorter treatment cycle. To kill the same number of cancerous cells, neutrons require one third the effective dose as protons.Keyhandokht Shahri, Laleh Motavalli, and Hashem Hakimabad.\\"Neutron Applications in Cancer Treatment\\" Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine 14:2(May‚ÄìAugust 2011) Another advantage is the established ability of neutrons to better treat some cancers, such as salivary gland, adenoid cystic carcinomas and certain types of brain tumors, especially high-grade gliomas Feng-Yi Yang, Wen-Yuan Chang, Jia-Je Li, Hsin-Ell Wang, Jyh-Cheng Chen, and Chi-Wei Chang.\\"Pharmacokinetic Analysis and Uptake of 18F-FBPA-Fr After Ultrasound-Induced Blood‚ÄìBrain Barrier Disruption for Potential Enhancement of Boron Delivery for Neutron Capture Therapy\\" Journal of Nuclear Medicine 55:616‚Äì621(2014) =LET= Comparison of Low LET electrons and High LET electrons When therapeutic energy X-rays (1 to 25 MeV) interact with cells in human tissue, they do so mainly by Compton interactions, and produce relatively high energy secondary electrons. These high energy electrons deposit their energy at about 1 keV/¬µm.Johns HE and Cunningham JR. The Physics of Radiology. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition 1978 By comparison, the charged particles produced at a site of a neutron interaction may deliver their energy at a rate of 30‚Äì80 keV/¬µm. The amount of energy deposited as the particles traverse a section of tissue is referred to as the linear energy transfer (LET). X-rays produce low LET radiation, and neutrons produce high LET radiation. Because the electrons produced from X-rays have high energy and low LET, when they interact with a cell typically only a few ionizations will occur. It is likely then that the low LET radiation will cause only single strand breaks of the DNA helix. Single strand breaks of DNA molecules can be readily repaired, and so the effect on the target cell is not necessarily lethal. By contrast, the high LET charged particles produced from neutron irradiation cause many ionizations as they traverse a cell, and so double- strand breaks of the DNA molecule are possible. DNA repair of double-strand breaks are much more difficult for a cell to repair, and more likely to lead to cell death. DNA repair mechanisms are quite efficient,Goodsell DS. Fundamentals of Cancer Medicine The Molecular Perspective: Double-Stranded DNA Breaks The Oncologist, Vol. 10, No. 5, 361‚Äì362, May 2005 and during a cell's lifetime many thousands of single strand DNA breaks will be repaired. A sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, however, delivers so many DNA breaks that it overwhelms the capability of the cellular mechanisms to cope. Heavy ion therapy (e.g. carbon ions) makes use of the similarly high LET of 12C6+ ions.Kubota N, Suzuki M, Furusawa Y, Ando K, Koike S, Kanai T, Yatagai F, Ohmura M, Tatsuzaki H, Matsubara S, et al.

The RBE of neutrons is also energy dependent, so neutron beams produced with different energy spectra at different facilities will have different RBE values. =Oxygen effect= The presence of oxygen in a cell acts as a radiosensitizer, making the effects of the radiation more damaging. Tumor cells typically have a lower oxygen content than normal tissue. This medical condition is known as tumor hypoxia and therefore the oxygen effect acts to decrease the sensitivity of tumor tissue.Vaupel P, Harrison L. Tumor Hypoxia: Causative Factors, Compensatory Mechanisms, and Cellular Response The Oncologist 2004;9(suppl 5):4‚Äì9 The oxygen effect may be quantitatively described by the Oxygen Enhancement Ratio (OER).

Radiation Protection Dosimetry 70:471‚Äì475 (1997) Side effects No cancer therapy is without the risk of side effects. Neutron therapy is a very powerful nuclear scalpel that has to be utilized with exquisite care. For instance, some of the most remarkable cures it has been able to achieve are with cancers of the head and neck. Many of these cancers cannot effectively be treated with other therapies. However, neutron damage to nearby vulnerable areas such as the brain and sensory neurons can produce irreversible brain atrophy, blindness, etc. The risk of these side effects can be greatly mitigated by several techniques, but they cannot be totally eliminated. Moreover, some patients are more susceptible to such side effects than others and this cannot be predicted in advance. The patient ultimately must decide whether the advantages of a possibly lasting cure outweigh the risks of this treatment when faced with an otherwise incurable cancer.The neutron-therapy saga: a cautionary tale ‚Äì MedicalPhysicsWeb Fast neutron centers Several centers around the world have used fast neutrons for treating cancer. Due to lack of funding and support, at present only three are active in the USA. The University of Washington and the Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center operate fast neutron therapy beams and both are equipped with a Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) to shape the neutron beam.Brahme A, Eenmaa J, Lindback S, Montelius A, Wootton P. Neutron beam characteristics from 50 MeV protons on beryllium using a continuously variable multi-leaf collimator. Radiother Oncol. 1983 Aug;1(1):65‚Äì76.Farr JB.

The UW Cyclotron is equipped with a gantry mounted delivery system an MLC to produce shaped fields. The UW Neutron system is referred to as the Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS).Clinical Neutron Therapy System (CNTS) The CNTS is typical of most neutron therapy systems. A large, well shielded building is required to cut down on radiation exposure to the general public and to house the necessary equipment. A beamline transports the proton beam from the cyclotron to a gantry system. The gantry system contains magnets for deflecting and focusing the proton beam onto the beryllium target. The end of the gantry system is referred to as the head, and contains dosimetry systems to measure the dose, along with the MLC and other beam shaping devices. The advantage of having a beam transport and gantry are that the cyclotron can remain stationary, and the radiation source can be rotated around the patient. Along with varying the orientation of the treatment couch which the patient is positioned on, variation of the gantry position allows radiation to be directed from virtually any angle, allowing sparing of normal tissue and maximum radiation dose to the tumor. During treatment, only the patient remains inside the treatment room (called a vault) and the therapists will remotely control the treatment, viewing the patient via video cameras. Each delivery of a set neutron beam geometry is referred to as a treatment field or beam. The treatment delivery is planned to deliver the radiation as effectively as possible, and usually results in fields that conform to the shape of the gross target, with any extension to cover microscopic disease. =Karmanos Cancer Center / Wayne State University= The neutron therapy facility at the Gershenson Radiation Oncology Center at Karmanos Cancer Center/Wayne State University (KCC/WSU) in Detroit bears some similarities to the CNTS at the University of Washington, but also has many unique characteristics. This unit was decommissioned in 2011. While the CNTS accelerates protons, the KCC facility produces its neutron beam by accelerating 48.5 MeV deuterons onto a beryllium target. This method produces a neutron beam with depth dose characteristics roughly similar to those of a 4 MV photon beam. The deuterons are accelerated using a gantry mounted superconducting cyclotron (GMSCC), eliminating the need for extra beam steering magnets and allowing the neutron source to rotate a full 360¬∞ around the patient couch. The KCC facility is also equipped with an MLC beam shaping device,Farr, J. B., R. L. Maughan, et al. (2007). \\"Radiologic validation of a fast neutron multileaf collimator.\\" Med Phys 34(9): 3475‚Äì3484. the only other neutron therapy center in the USA besides the CNTS.

Within this soccer league there are three divisions, Division I, Division II, and Division III. Divisions I and II have 10 teams each. Division III has 7. In the past, there were two different seasons in a year. The spring season would start in the middle of January and end in the first week of July. The fall season would begin in August and end in December. In the present day, the league president issued a change of the scheduling process. Instead of having two short seasons, they decided to make one long season which lasts approximately a year. The new season starts in the August and ends in July. This new long soccer season started in the Fall of 2006. The soccer participants vary in age. The ages range from high school students to adults in their 40s. Soccer has been on the rise in Hawaii and allowing high school players to participate with older, mature, and better players will allow them to learn and grow. Soccer players out of high school or just out of college have an opportunity to keep up their fitness as well as their soccer abilities. Within the league there is a tournament in which all teams participate in, the Robledo Cup. This gives a chance to the second and third division teams to prove that they are worthy to be in the first division. At the end of every season, the team from Division II who wins their season is promoted to Division I. The same happens with the winner of Division III. The team in Division I and II with the fewest points at the end of the season will be relegated and sent down to Division II and Division III respectively Goals The goals of the league are: * To provide an amateur soccer league where participants can have a competitive soccer environment. * To encourage sportsmanship from the players for the public. A positive example should be shown for future soccer players. * To build a setting for young, gifted soccer players to perform against quality soccer stars. Division I Teams 1\\\\.

These colours are the same as in the flag of the United Kingdom. The colours of the flag are in turn taken from the flags of England (white and red) and of Scotland (blue and white), which have been combined to form the union flag; to this was later added a red saltire for Ireland. The UK's constituent countries are normally identified respectively with white (England), blue (Scotland), red (Wales), green (in respect of Ireland in general), and occasionally black (for the culturally distinctive English county of Cornwall). History In maps of the 19th and 20th centuries, the territories of the British Empire were usually coloured red or pink. Historically, the British Armed Forces fought in red, a traditional colour that remains in use in formal and ceremonial uniforms. Militarily, and in other contexts, the single chief colour associated with the UK is therefore red, such as in the famous British Army red coats. Usage =Sport= In many international team sports the different countries of the United Kingdom are represented by separate teams. In those where the United Kingdom competes as one team, either under its own name or that of Great Britain (such as in the Olympic Games), colours used for the team are red, white and blue, where the blue is often a very dark blue. In motor racing, the national colour of the United Kingdom is green; this is known as British racing green and its somewhat uncertain origin purports that it stems from the Gordon Bennett Cup of 1903. Britain was hosting the race in Ireland and adopted the shamrock green in honour; the colour has been retained ever since, and featured in several Commonwealth racing colours too. =Transport= The colours on British airways parked at London Heathrow Airport tube train in London Red, white and blue are also the colours of the London Underground, the rapid transit system of the United Kingdom's capital. Since the 1990s, the underground trains have been painted in red, white and blue. =Orders and decorations= British orders and medals whose ribbons are in the national colours include the Royal Victorian Order, the Royal Victorian Medal, the Queen's Gallantry Medal, and all the commemorative Coronation and Jubilee Medals since 1936. =At sea= At sea, 'national colours' refer to a distinctive flag used to demonstrate a vessel's country of origin. In 1867, an Order in Council defined that \\"the Red Ensign and Union Jack with a White Border continuing as at present the national colours for all British Ships. The white bordered Union Jack is now commonly known as the Pilot Jack.

Early and family life Born in Old Mount Airy, Virginia, Davis attended the old field schools and was privately tutored as a child. He later attended and graduated from Emory and Henry College, then read law. He married Mary Jane Dickenson Davis (1848 - 1896), daughter of Col. John Dickenson of Grayson County (and for whom Dickenson County was named upon its creation in 1880). They would have at least three sons: Albert Conley Davis (1869 - 1893), Joseph C Davis (1871 - 1888) and James Garnett Davis (1873 - 1931). Career Admitted to the bar in 1854, Davis began his private legal practice in Wytheville, Virginia, and later moved to Independence, Virginia. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Davis served in the Confederate Army as captain of Company C of the 45th Regiment, Virginia Infantry in 1861. He earned a promotion to major in 1862 and another to lieutenant colonel in 1864. Captured near the end of the war, he was held prisoner on Johnson's Island in Lake Erie. After his release, Davis was elected to the Virginia Senate, and served from 1869 to 1871, when he was succeeded by fellow Confederate veteran Abner W. C. Nowlin. The following year Davis ran as a Democrat for the United States House of Representatives. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 50.55% of the vote, defeating Republican Christopher Yancy Thomas. However, Thomas successfully contested the result and was seated in March 1874. Afterward, Davis resumed practicing law in Independence, Virginia Death and legacy Davis died on September 25, 1889, and was interred in the Davis Family Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=53803339 Some of his family's papers are held in the special collections at the College of William and Mary.

Biography  Headstone marking the resting place for the poet Nguyen Chi Thien at the Christ Cathedral in Orange County, California Thien was educated in private academies and was a supporter of Viet Minh revolutionaries in his early life. In 1960, however, he challenged the official account of World War II ‚Äì that the Soviet Union had defeated the Imperial Army of Japan in Manchuria, ending the war ‚Äì while teaching a high school history class. Thien told the class that the United States defeated Japan when they dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and served three years and six months in re-education camps. Thien began composing poems in prison and committed them to memory. After a brief release in 1966, he was jailed again for composing politically irreverent poems. He denied the charges, and spent another eleven years and five months in labor camps.talawas  B√πi VƒÉn Ph√∫ ‚Äì Hai gi·ªù v·ªõi thi sƒ© Nguy·ªÖn Ch√≠ Thi·ªán In 1977, two years after Saigon fell, Thien and other political prisoners were released to make room for officers of the Republic of Vietnam. Thien used the opportunity of his release to write down the poems he had thus far committed solely to memory. Two days after Bastille Day, on 16 July 1979, after having been thwarted from his initial plan to enter the French embassy because of the closely guarded compound, Thien dashed into the British embassy in Hanoi with his manuscript of four hundred poems and the cover letter drafted in French as it was meant for the original destination. British diplomats welcomed him and promised to send his manuscript out of the country. When he got out of the embassy, security agents were already waiting for him at the gate. He was imprisoned yet again, this time in the Hoa Lo prison (\\"Hanoi Hilton\\") for six years, then six more years at other prisons in northern Vietnam. During this imprisonment, Thien's poems which made their way to the West were translated into English by Hu·ª≥nh Sanh Th√¥ng of Yale University. The work won the International Poetry Award in Rotterdam in 1985. He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in 1986. Twelve years after bringing his manuscript to the British Embassy, he was released from jail. He lived in Hanoi under close watch by the authorities, but his international following also kept an eye on Thien. Human Rights Watch honored him in 1995. That year he was also permitted to emigrate to the United States with the intervention of Noboru Masuoka, a retired Air Force colonel and career military officer who was drafted into the U.S. Army following internment in Heart Mountain camp for Japanese Americans in 1945. He immediately wrote Hoa Dia Nguc II, poems composed in his memory (as he was not allowed pen and paper in prison) from 1979 to 1988. They were published in bilingual editions (Vietnamese and English) then again in its Vietnamese entirety in 2006. In 1998 Nguyen Chi Thien was awarded a fellowship from the International Parliament of Writers. He lived in France for three years, writing the Hoa Lo Stories, prose narrative of his experiences in prison. These were translated and published in English as the Hoa Lo / Hanoi Hilton Stories by Yale Southeast Asia Studies in 2007. Thien's original manuscript was returned to him in early 2008 by the widow of Prof. Patrick Honey of the University of London, who had shared the material with many Vietnamese exiles, but always guarded the original work. Nguyen Chi Thien died in Santa Ana, California on 2 October 2012.

The pair began silkscreening t-shirts with artwork from their friends in Long‚Äôs San Francisco garage. They wanted to help promote the San Francisco art scene and distract from their day jobs. Shortly after starting, one of Long‚Äôs friends, artist Tim Biskup joined them, and printed shirts with Biskup‚Äôs Gama- Goon character. The three of them together took the basement hobby and turned it into a company. In 2006, Tim Biskup ceased his creative involvement with the company. In 2006, GAMAGO shifted their focus from apparel to gifts for the home and kitchen. 2009 saw the release of The Flipper, a guitar shaped spatula. The success of The Flipper helped to cement GAMAGO's name among the top gift-ware design companies. GAMAGO products are available in 3000+ stores internationally. In June 2017 the company was acquired by NMR America and Greg Long exited. He next co-founded the consumer cannabis brand, Murmmr. Chris Edmundson remains the Creative Director of the GAMAGO brand.

Joe. In West Germany, he was known as the Schwarzer Major. Characterisation The Black Major was depicted in the Battle Action Force comic book series as a member of the Red Shadows and second-in-command to Baron Ironblood. Limited information is given in to his background on the file cards that accompanied the action figure although it is variously believed that he was either a traitor from Action Force (as a former British Special Boat Service marine commando) or was otherwise a captive of Baron Ironblood, subsequently brainwashed into: > a dedicated and ruthless follower. Brilliant military commander and > tactician. Totally emotionless. The Black Major carries out Baron > Ironblood's orders without question. His primary military specialty is stated as Combat Control though all other information is classed as Classified. However, his real name is referred to a number of times in his extensive back story. Court martialled in absentia by his former Royal Marine unit and disowned by his family following his treachery, his name is derived from the Spanish phrase el comandante negro, which was shouted at him by Andean soldiers in his first engagement for the Red Shadows. =Graphic representation= The figure is a repaint of the Action Force commander (a figure only available via a mail-in offer), giving some weight to his characterisation as a former Action Force member. The figure was provided with an AK-47 assault rifle and a red paper codebook. Using the codebook one was able to decipher the characters used on Red Shadow vehicles (such as Shadowtrak), decals and armour as well as occasional Red Shadow wording used in the comic books. Transition to Cobra The Black Major was one of the key characters retained in the storylines surrounding the transition from the Red Shadows to Cobra. The evolution of both the action figures and the comic strip to conform to G. I. Joe in the mid-1980s saw a storyline where Ironblood betrayed the Red Shadows, leaking information about their bases and intentions to the UN. As the Shadows were wiped out, Ironblood constructed a new identity for himself, becoming Cobra Commander, and creating Cobra as a new enemy force. While Red Jackal sought his own revenge and instead became Destro, the Black Major, Red Laser and Red Vulture stuck together and went in search of Cobra Commander. The Major finally confronted him at gunpoint during a battle with Action Force. He was taken aback when Cobra Commander addressed him by his real name of \\"Shepherd\\" and was even more surprised to recognise his voice as Ironblood's. He dropped his guard long enough for Cobra Commander to squirt him with cobra venom from a ring on his finger. He was rescued by Red Laser and Red Vulture. Determined on revenge, the Black Major now led his own group of surviving Red Shadows and fought his own war against Cobra, independent of Action Force. The Major's next appearance in Battle Action Force was in Showdown for the Shadows, in which he sought one final counter-attack against the combined AF forces. The Black Major escaped with a fortune in valuables. On another occasion, he destroyed the so-called School for Snakes where Cobra had assembled child prodigies from all over the world and brainwashed them into serving Cobra Commander. A chance encounter with Destro lead to them plotting to assassinate Cobra Commander, though this truce was short-lived. His final appearance was in the Battle Action Force Annual 1987 Storm Shadow story where, acting upon a tip-off, Cobra Commander dispatched Storm Shadow to eliminate the Black Major. He barely escaped with his life and was not heard from again. In 2010, the Red Shadows were the main adversary featured in the Official G.I. Joe Collectors' Club Convention Set. The set featured a new, G.I. Joe-style version of the Black Major as one of the figures in the set, and the file card information stated that the Black Major was in charge of the Red Shadows. In 2013 The Black Major and his Red Shadows returned in the IDW G.I.Joe comic book. They had allied themselves with Cobra forces to gain influence over the ruler of a small country. The Major quickly betrayed his allies when the G.I.Joe team attacked. His Red Shadows were either slain or captured.

Mandate The mandate of the Federation is to advance and promote the vitality and excellence of Canadian fine craft, nationally and internationally, and to the benefit of Canadian craftspeople and the community at large. The acts as a catalyst for projects managed by members in the provincial and territorial craft councils, operating as the initiator, facilitator and promoter of local, national and international events representing Canadian craftspeople and fine craft. History Since in 1900 there has been a national craft organization in Canada. The foundation of the Canadian Guild of Crafts in that year heralded the beginning of nationwide cooperation in the crafts sector. In 1974 the Guild merged with other craft organizations and associations to create the Canadian Crafts Council (CCC). When federal government funding to the CCC was discontinued in 1966 the office in Ottawa was closed. A small band of five volunteers formed a transition board and kept the legal entity alive. In May, 1998, at a meeting of stakeholders in Montreal the future of a national organization was discussed. It was agreed the CCC should be transformed into a national network for crafts under the name Canadian Crafts Federation / F√©d√©ration canadienne des m√©tiers d'art (CCF/FCMA). An Interim Directorate was elected. They oversaw the transformation process and conducted the affairs of the new organization pending election of Federation board. The Canadian Crafts Federation held its first general meeting in September 1999 at which time a slate of officers were elected. Projects Major projects by the CCF/FCMA include large scale market studies (such as the Canadian Fine Craft Niche Market Study and the Profile and Development Strategy for Craft in Canada) as well as national and international collaborative projects (such as the Craft Year 2007 festival). In the fall of 2009, the CCF/FCMA spearheaded the largest exhibition of Canadian contemporary fine craft ever compiled, 'Unity & Diversity'. This exhibition of 212 works by 206 artists was displayed in its entirety at the Cheongju Arts Centre in the Canadian Pavilion at the 2009 Cheongju International Craft Biennale in Cheongju, South Korea. Canada was the special guest country for 2009, which had the CCF/FCMA and the Biennale working together on special lectures, presentations, demonstrations, tours, an educational lounge and a special boutique. Over 300,000 visitors attended the events, which ran from September 23 to November 1, 2009. Selected Works from 'Unity & Diversity' went on to be displayed at the Museum of Vancouver as one of three exhibitions in a triptych of shows titled 'Art of Craft'. 72 pieces from the original 'Unity & Diversity' exhibition were showcased alongside 'By Hand', an exhibition of fine craft from British Columbia and the Yukon, as well as 'Moments In Between', an exhibition of fine craft from South Korea. The show was a featured event of the 2010 Cultural Olympiad for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver.

The object of the club is to promote social discourse among its members and to further the interests of organists. Origins The club was founded in 1908, following an October 5 dinner meeting convened by Dr. Leighton Parks, rector of St. Bartholomew's Church, to introduce 17 of the city's leading church musicians to Arthur S. Hyde,\\"Capt. Arthur S. Hyde Dies\\", The New York Times, February 26, 1920. Leopold Stokowski's successor as St. Bartholomew's organist. The founders named the club in honor of Saint Wilfrid (sometimes spelled Wilfred or Wilfrith, c.633 ‚Äì c.709), an influential English bishop known for his strong advocacy of sacred music. In a typical year, the club would have three formal dinner meetings with invited guest speakers.\\"St. Wilfred Club to Meet\\", The New York Times, May 30, 1937. Membership The club was limited to 25 members at first, and membership was still just 30 in 1939. Today there are three classes of membership: resident, non-resident, and honorary. Resident members, currently limited to 85 in number, consist of organists of recognized standing who work in greater New York City or within a radius of 60 miles of New York City. While election to the club is limited to those who meet these requirements, there are no other exclusions to club membership. Prospective members are proposed and seconded by current resident members in good standing and voted on by the entire membership. New members may be nominated as vacancies occur. Organists of note, outstanding professional musicians who are not organists, and others who have rendered distinguished service in any line of endeavor, may be elected honorary members through the same process of balloting as that for resident members. Resident members, upon removing from the greater New York City area, automatically become non-resident members. Other organists of recognized standing, who reside at a considerable distance from New York, may be elected to non-resident membership through the same process as that for resident members. A non-resident member returning or moving to work in the greater New York City area may request to be transferred to the resident member list, if and when there is a vacancy.St. Wilfrid Club bylaws, updated July 31, 2011. Members in all three categories enjoy equal club access and privileges, except the holding of office and voting, which is confined to resident members. Regular attendance is expected as evidence of active interest in the club. If unable to attend a meeting, resident and non- resident members are asked to notify the Secretary of the club. Those who consistently fail to reply may be asked to resign in order to secure openings for proposals of candidates who may have expressed interest in membership. While there are no secret rituals or other specific attributes of membership, the identities of the club's living members are not generally known except to other members. Governance The club is governed by a Chair, elected for a term of two years (originally one year), together with an executive committee consisting of two members, who are also elected for a term of two years. Two years must have elapsed before the Chair, or members of the executive committee may be re-elected. Two other officers maintain the operation of the club: a recording secretary and a treasurer, who are each elected for a term of two years, but who are eligible for re-election without restriction.

The musical is the story of a fourteen-year-old boy growing up in the heartland of America. This Broadway musical version of Mark Twain's novel is set in 1840 in St. Petersburg, Missouri, a bustling town on the banks of the Mississippi River. In the course of the story, Tom matches wits with his stern Aunt Polly, falls in love with the beautiful, feisty Becky Thatcher, and goes on the adventure of his life with Becky and Huckleberry Finn. Along the way he meets a terrifying villain named Injun Joe, Tom's bratty half-brother Sid, and all the other boys and girls in the village. Productions The Adventures of Tom Sawyer opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theater on April 26, 2001 and closed on May 13, 2001, after 21 performances and 34 previews. The musical was directed by Scott Ellis with choreography by David Marques, and featured Joshua Park as Tom Sawyer, Kristen Bell as Becky Thatcher, Jim Poulos as Huckleberry Finn, with Linda Purl (Aunt Polly), Tom Aldredge (Muff Potter), Stephen Lee Anderson (Doc Robinson/Pap), Jane Connell (Widow Douglas), John Dossett (Judge Thatcher) and Kevin Durand (Injun Joe). Synopsis =Act One= In 1840, Tom Sawyer is fishing outside St. Petersburg, Missouri as his friends arrive, and the children play a game of Robin Hood (\\"Hey, Tom Sawyer\\"). Tom's Aunt Polly sends him to school, where he tricks the schoolmaster, Mr. Dobbins, into letting the class have the day off. Aunt Polly, Mr. Dobbins and the preacher, Reverend Sprague, lament that they \\"can‚Äôt do a thing about the boy.\\" That Saturday, Aunt Polly orders Tom to whitewash a fence in front of their house, and Tom's half-brother, Sid, is happy. Frustrated, Tom plans to run away (\\"Here's My Plan\\"). As Tom procrastinates, he meets beautiful newcomer Becky Thatcher, and they are mutually attracted. The town's outcast and Tom's best friend Huckleberry Finn appears and arranges for the two of them to meet at the local graveyard that night so that Huck can \\"cure his warts.\\" Huck remarks that painting the fence looks like fun, and Tom then swindles his friends into painting the fence for him after having them trade their valuables. (\\"Smart Like That\\"). That night, Tom and Huck visit the local graveyard and see Doc Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe, a \\"half- breed\\" troublemaker, robbing a man's grave (\\"Hands All Clean\\"). After a scuffle about ownership of the dead man's watch, Joe murders Doc Robinson and frames Muff for it. The boys run away and swear in blood to \\"keep mum forever\\" about what they saw (\\"The Vow\\"). On the way to church, single parents Aunt Polly and Judge Thatcher lament about \\"Raising A Child By Yourself.\\" In church, Tom tries to impress Becky by fooling Reverend Sprague into giving him the \\"Bible Prize\\" (\\"It‚Äôs In The Bible\\"). Tom tries to convince a fearful Huck to learn to read. When Huck saves old Widow Douglas from the advances of the town drunk, she offers to teach him to read and to live in her home. However, Huck declines (\\"It Just Ain‚Äôt Me\\"). That day in school, the girls are gossiping over a book of poetry that Becky found belonging to Mr. Dobbins, the teacher. When Mr. Dobbins enters, the girls panic and drop the book. When Mr. Dobbins is teaching, he discovers the book on the ground and angrily interrogates the students about who took it. When he is about to get Becky to confess, Tom lies and says he took the book. Before Tom can be punished, the Sheriff calls Dobbins away, needing a coroner after discovering Doc Robinson's body. Tom and Becky proclaim their undying love for each other (\\"To Hear You Say My Name\\"). Muff Potter is arrested for murder, and he pleads with Injun Joe to save him from hanging. Joe agrees to help, but in return, he wants a map that Muff has found: a map leading to a treasure, Murrell's Gold (\\"Murrel's Gold\\"). After Joe leaves and Muff is taken away, Tom expresses his wish to tell everyone what really happened in the graveyard, but Huck says that if he does, they'll both surely be killed by Injun Joe, and Tom would be breaking their vow (\\"Murrell's Gold (Reprise)\\"). At Muff Potter's trial, Tom go through with his plan to testify. He tells the truth and swears that Injun Joe committed the murder. Injun Joe yells \\"You are dead, boy!\\", throws a knife at Tom, and runs from the courtroom chased by the Sheriff (\\"The Testimony\\"). =Act Two= As school ends for the summer, the children celebrate, but their parents remind them that they have chores and that they \\"can't just sit and twiddle [their] thumbs\\" (\\"Ain‚Äôt Life Fine\\"). Huck tells Tom that Injun Joe has returned, and Tom tells Aunt Polly that he won't be attending the annual town picnic. Aunt Polly tries to convince him to go, and then tells him she'll still love him (\\"This Time Tomorrow\\"). After weeks of secret tutoring by Widow Douglas, Huck finally learns how to read and they celebrate (\\"I Can Read\\"). At the annual town picnic the festivities start with the exploration of McDougal's Cave. As the town people go to the cave, Injun Joe makes his presence known to Muff, wanting to know where he found the map. After a violent interrogation, Muff reveals to Joe that the map came from the cave. Injun Joe states that he will go into the cave to find Murrell's Gold (\\"Murrell's Gold (Second Reprise)\\"). As the children explore the cave, Tom takes Becky to a hidden part of the cave. As they explore, Tom and Becky realize they are lost. Aunt Polly and Judge Thatcher, with the rest of the town people, frantically search for them (\\"Angels Lost\\"). Underground, as Tom and Becky seek a way out of the cave, Tom comforts Becky after telling her they are on their last candle.(\\"Light\\"). Tom uses a reel of kite string to look for a way out while Becky can rest. As Becky prays to God that they will be found (\\"Angels Lost (Reprise)\\"), Injun Joe grabs Becky, but Tom jumps out from behind a rock and fights him off until Huck arrives. The three friends all come together to fight Injun Joe, which ends with Tom accidentally stabbing Joe in the chest, leading Joe to stumble into a ravine to his death. The shaken children find Murrell's Gold and see daylight shining through a crack in the wall. They escape from the cave, finally safe. As the people of St. Petersburg hold a funeral service for the lost children (\\"Light (Reprise)\\") Tom, Huck and Becky limp into town. They realize that they're watching their own funeral. The children are discovered and the town people are wild with happiness (\\"Ain‚Äôt Life Fine (Reprise)\\"). Huck tells Tom that he can read, and the two friends join the celebration (\\"Finale\\").

No one was hurt in the robbery, and Brown had voluntarily returned the wallet to the victim. Brown's case attracted some attention in the press in 2006, and he was later granted a conditional pardon by Texas Governor Rick Perry.Avila, Jim, Martelli, Joan, and Clarke, Connie, Update: Man Jailed for Joint Set Free, ABC News 20/20, March 26, 2007. He was released on March 16, 2007. Press attention Brown's case was contrasted in the press with the case of an influential white defendant; both defendants were sentenced by the same judge, Keith Dean. The other man had committed murder by shooting an unarmed prostitute in the back (and then taking money from his victim after shooting him), and had then violated his parole by repeatedly testing positive for cocaine use over a period of several years, breaking through the glass door of a woman's home to confront her in a dispute, living with at least two men who had multiple criminal convictions, and being arrested for crack cocaine possession while driving a congressman's car. Probation records indicated that the man had failed five drug tests over a three-year period. In contrast with the way Brown was treated, the other defendant was never sent to jail and received an early lifting of all of the usual conditions of probation. After Brown's case and the contrasting treatment of the other man became well known, in part due to a feature report on the ABC News television program 20/20, the judge involved in the two cases, Keith Dean, failed to win re-election to his position. Original crime When he was 17 years old, Brown and another 17-year-old committed a robbery. Brown and his partner confronted a man with a pistol and demanded that he give them his wallet. The victim handed his wallet to Brown, and after removing the two dollars that it contained, Brown returned the wallet to him. Brown was a high-school dropout and had been a victim of child abuse by his father, who had reportedly beat him. Judge Keith Dean in Dallas, Texas originally sentenced Brown to 10 years of probation for the crime, before changing his sentence to life in prison after he tested positive once for marijuana use.

He studied at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in 1699. He was one of the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations between July 1717 and October 1721. He entered Parliament in March 1721 as Member of Parliament for Tregony in Cornwall. In September he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty, a post which he held until 1725. He was also later appointed Clerk of the Council in Ireland. At the general election of 1722, Pulteney was elected for two constituencies, Hedon (the Yorkshire borough owned by his cousin William Pulteney, who was its other MP) and Preston, which he chose to represent. He sat as Preston's MP for the remaining nine years of his life. Although a Whig, he detested Robert Walpole. At first he was enthusiastic supporter of Sunderland, having married his wife's sister; after Sunderland's fall he was one of the early members of the Patriot Whigs (of which William Pulteney quickly became the central figure). He married Margaret Tichborne (c. 1699-1763), daughter of Benjamin Tichborne, on 14 December 1717. Their three sons all died in childhood. His youngest daughter, Frances, who married William Johnstone, inherited the vast Pulteney fortune from Daniel's cousins, at which her husband changed his name to Pulteney.

The name of these figures comes from the Sanskrit ≈õƒÅlabha√±jikƒÅ meaning 'breaking a branch of a sala tree'. They are also known as madanakai, madanika or shilabalika, and the term is somewhat interchangeable with female, tree-graping yakshi. Shalabhanjika on Eastern Torana (gateway), Sanchi Stupa The shalabhanjika is a standard decorative element of Indian sculpture, a graceful stone sculpture representing a young female under a stylised tree in various poses, such as dancing, grooming herself or playing a musical instrument. The salabhanjika's female features, like breasts and hips, are often exaggerated. Frequently these sculpted figures display complex hairdos and an abundance of jewellery. Most hold that salabhanjika is emerged from ancient tree deities in Indian popular religion, related to fertility.Heinrich Zimmer, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization. (1946) The shalabhanjika concept stems from ancient symbolism linking a chaste maiden with the sala tree or the asoka tree through the ritual called dohada, or the fertilisation of plants through contact with a young woman. The symbolism changed over the course of time and the shalabhanjika became figures used as ornamental carvings, usually located in the area where worshipers engage in circumambulation, near the garbhagriha of many Hindu temples. Placed at an angle, salabhanjika figures also were used in temple architecture as a bracket figures. Salabhanjikas are also often mentioned in ancient and modern Indian literature. Locations Some of the most renowned salabhanjika sculptures are to be found in the 12th-century Hoysala temples of Belur, Halebidu and Somanathapura, in south-central Karnataka. The shalabhanjika on the East gateway (Torana), is the best known sculpture of the Sanchi Stupa near Bhopal, a World Heritage site, built from the 1st to the 12th centuries. One of early examples are the shalabhanjikas of built in Shunga dynasty dating to the 2nd or 1st century BC, found at the Durakhi Devi Temple, after the excavation of Kumhrar, the remains of an ancient city of Pataliputra.An overview of archaeological importance of Bihar Directorate of Archaeology, Govt. of Bihar.\\"Shalabhanjika (the breaker of branches),\\" Another less-known location famous for its outstanding salabhanjikas is a Chalukya period temple in Jalasangvi, Homnabad Taluk on the Gulbarga-Bidar state highway, at the northern end of Karnataka. Its well- endowed Madanika figures in seductive tribhanga poses are \\"...moon breasted, swan-waisted and elephant-hipped\\", according to the Indian artistic canons. These older feminine sculptures were the source of inspiration for the later Hoysala bracket-figures.India Travelogue ‚Äì Jalasangvi Related iconography The sal tree (Shorea robusta) is often confused with the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) in the ancient literature of the Indian subcontinent.Eckard Schleberger, Die indische G√∂tterwelt.

Components () have at least one independent backup component (+1). The level of resilience is referred to as active/passive or standby as backup components do not actively participate within the system during normal operation. The level of transparency (disruption to system availability) during failover is dependent on a specific solution, though degradation to system resilience will occur during failover. It is also possible to have +1 redundancy with active-active components, in such cases the backup component will remain active in the operation even if all other components are fully functional, however the system will be able to perform in the event that one component is faulted and recover from a single component failure.  Examples of N+1 redundancy  = N+1 redundancy = * Connecting devices (server etc.) in dual switch storage area network (SAN) fabrics employ a discrete path to each switch. Only one path is active at any given time, resiliency is provided by the availability of an additional path if the active path becomes unavailable. * Data centre power generators that activate when the normal power source is unavailable. = 1+1 redundancy = 1+1 redundancy typically offers the advantage of additional failover transparency in the event of component failure. The level of resilience is referred to as active/active or hot as backup components actively participate with the system during normal operation. Failover is generally transparent (no disruption to system availability) as failover does not actually occur (just degradation to system resilience) as the backup components were already active within the system. * Dual active power supplies in a server. * Mirrored hard drives within a server/PC system. = 2+1 or 3+1 redundancy = 2+1 redundancy or 3+1 redundancy is common on power systems for blade servers where a relatively small number of highly rated Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) efficiently power a greater number of blades. An example is a server chassis that has three power supplies; the system may be set to 2+1 redundancy so that the blades can enjoy the power of two PSUs and have one available to give redundancy if one fails. It is also common to mix live (hot) redundancy where UPS's are online, and cold standby redundancy where they are offline until needed. The reason for this, in the case of UPS's, is that a common failure mode is component's end-of-life failure, and if UPS's are equally used, then they are highly likely to fail within a short space of time of each other when toward the end of service life.  Applications  Redundant systems are often used in data centers to ensure that computer systems continue without service interruption. Other common implementations include aerospace, where redundant systems are used to improve safety and integrity of spacecraft, electric power systems and automobiles, where the emergency brake is available in a car as a redundant component in case of failure of the main brake systems.

The originality of the developed automated means of calculation of machine tool nodes is made with new methods of the advanced final element and empirical methods of calculation. There were developed the technology and equipment for plotting multi-layers abrasive resistant covers on tools and details ensuring essential increase of their reliability and resource. There was developed the system of interpreters of the dialogue \\"person - computer\\", intended for acceleration and reduction of labour input of creation of appropriate appendices. The source submission of dialogues are the graphs of states, system functions on platforms of Windows 95 and Windows NT. The system was created as the tool for fast development and modernising of MMI appendices for open systems of the numerical control. There was developed the method of substitutions of problem solving on the graphs. With the help of the given method it is possible to decide both optimisation problems relating the class of discrete programming problems and combinatorial problems on the graphs with edges without weights. The principle of pair substitutions with combination of the possibility of use the vectors of topology has allowed mathematically to formulate new classes of optimisation and combinatorial problems on the graphs, which could not be solved earlier by known widely classical methods.

When this technique is used with a large number of closely related species, this is called phylogenetic shadowing.Phylogenetic Shadowing of Primate Sequences to Find Functional Regions of the Human Genome Researchers have found that non-coding pieces of DNA contain binding sites for regulatory proteins that govern the spatiotemporal expression of genes. These transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), or regulatory motifs, have proven hard to identify, primarily because they are short in length, and can show sequence variation. The importance of understanding transcriptional regulation to many fields of biology has led researchers to develop strategies for predicting the presence of TFBS, many of which have led to publicly available databases. One such technique is Phylogenetic Footprinting. Phylogenetic footprinting relies upon two major concepts: # The function and DNA binding preferences of transcription factors are well-conserved between diverse species. # Important non-coding DNA sequences that are essential for regulating gene expression will show differential selective pressure. A slower rate of change occurs in TFBS than in other, less critical, parts of the non- coding genome.Neph, S. and Tompa, M. 2006. MicroFootPrinter: a tool for phylogenetic footprinting in prokaryotic genomes. Nucleic Acids Research. 34: 366-368 History  Phylogenetic footprinting was first used and published by Tagle et al. in 1988, which allowed researchers to predict evolutionary conserved cis-regulatory elements responsible for embryonic Œµ and Œ≥ globulin gene expression in primates.Tagle, D. A., Koop, B. F., Goodman, M., Slightom, J. L., Hess, D., and Jones, R. T. 1988. Embryonic Œµ and Œ≥ globin genes of a prosimian primate (Galago crassicaudatis): nucleotide and amino acid sequences, developmental regulation, and phylogenetic footprints. J. Mol. Biol. 203:439-455. Before phylogenetic footprinting, DNase footprinting was used, where protein would be bound to DNA transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) protecting it from DNase digestion. One of the problems with this technique was the amount of time and labor it would take. Unlike DNase footprinting, phylogenetic footprinting relies on evolutionary constraints within the genome, with the \\"important\\" parts of the sequence being conserved among the different species.Zhang, Z. and Gerstein, M. 2003. Of mice and men: phylogenetic footprinting aids the discovery of regulatory elements.J. Biol.2:11-11.4  Protocol  Phylogenetic Footprinting technique protocol It is important when using this technique to decide which genome your sequence should be aligned to. More divergent species will have less sequence similarity between orthologous genes. Therefore, the key is to pick species that are related enough to detect homology, but divergent enough to maximize non-alignment \\"noise\\". Step wise approach to Phylogenetic footprinting consists of : # One should decide on the gene of interest. # Carefully choose species with orthologous genes. # Decide on the length of the upstream or maybe downstream region to be looked at. # Align the sequences. # Look for conserved regions and analyse them.  Not all TFBS are found  Not all transcription binding sites can be found using phylogenetic footprinting due to the statistical nature of this technique. Here are several reasons why some TFBS are not found: = Species specific binding sites = Some binding sites seem to have no significant matches in most other species. Therefore, detecting these sites by phylogenetic footprinting is likely impossible unless a large number of closely related species are available. = Very short binding sites = Some binding sites show excellent conservation, but just in a shorter region than the ones were looked for. Such short motifs (e.g., GC- box) often occur by chance in nonfunctional sequences and detecting these motifs can be challenging. = Less specific binding factors = Some binding sites show some conservation but have had insertions or deletions. It is not obvious if these sequences with insertions or deletions are still functional. Though they may still be functional if the binding factor is less specific (or less 'picky' if you will). Because deletions and insertions are rare in binding sites, considering insertions and deletions in the sequence would detect a few more true TFBSs, but it could likely include many more false positives. = Not enough data = Some motifs are quite well conserved, but they are statistically insignificant in a specific dataset. The motif might have appeared in different species by chance. These motifs could be detected if sequences from more organisms are available. So this will be less of a problem in the future. = Compound binding regions = Some transcription factors bind as dimers. Therefore, their binding sites may consist of two conserved regions, separated by a few variable nucleotides. Because of the variable internal sequence, the motif cannot be detected. However, if we could use a program to search for motifs containing a variable sequence in the middle, without counting mutations, these motifs could be discovered.  Accuracy  It is important to keep in mind that not all conserved sequences are under selection pressure. To eliminate false positives statistical analysis must be performed that will show that the motifs reported have a mutation rate meaningfully less than that of the surrounding nonfunctional sequence. Moreover, results could be more accurate if the prior knowledge about the sequence is considered. For example, some regulatory elements are repeated 15 times in a promoter region (e.g., some metallothionein promoters have up to 15 metal response elements (MREs)). Thus, to eliminate false motifs with inconsistent order across species, the orientation and order of regulatory elements in a promoter region should be the same in all species. This type of information could help us to identify regulatory elements that are not adequately conserved but occur in several copies in the input sequence.Blanchette, M. and Tompa, M. 2002.

History  The first heat-shrinkable sleeves were introduced as polyethylene pipeline coatings started to replace bituminous or tape coatings in the oil and gas industry. At the time, the processing for polyethylene to make the sleeve backing was new technology and the adhesives used in sleeves were much the same as those used on pipeline coating. The technology used to make sleeves has advanced significantly since then, with new methods of cross-linking the polyolefin backings and new-generation adhesives that are formulated to provide performance under more-demanding pipeline conditions.\\"Coating properties and test procedures.: An article from: Pipeline & Gas Journal \\" written by J.M. Leeds (April 2, 2010)  Composition & Manufacture  =Polyolefin Backing= Heat-shrinkable means just that, heat them up and they shrink, or more correctly, they recover in length. A heat-shrinkable sleeve starts out with a thick extruded poly olefin sheet (polyethylene or polypropylene) that is formulated to be cross-linkable. After extruding the thick sheet, it is taken to the \\"beam\\" where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation.Accelerator apps: heat- shrink tubing , Symmetry, Dimensions of Particle Physics. V. 7, Issue 2, Apr. 10 The irradiation process cross-links the polyolefin. This improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work as part of a heat- shrinkable sleeve and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in-service. It makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough, heat- resistant, elastic material or rubber,Covalence, the Principles of Heat Shrinking, Berry Plastics rather than like a plastic material. After cross- linking, the sheet is stretched by feeding it into a machine that heats it up, stretches it and cools it down. Because the sheet has been cross-linked, after stretching, it will want to recover to its original length when re-heated. In recent years, many manufacturers had already developed their technologies of extruding and expansion of polyolefin backing. In the past, the production process of backing was done by extruding, cross-linking and expansion. However, in order to increase the production efficiency, some of manufacturers expand the backing during extruding, and then send the backing to e-beam for the cross-linking process. =Adhesives and Functions= An adhesive is then applied to the sheet and various manufacturers use proprietary techniques depending on the type, viscosity and melting temperature of the adhesive. The adhesive is the key to ultimate performance of the installed system, which is why different adhesive types will be specified depending on the pipeline operating conditions. The adhesive has many functions; it adheres the installed sleeve to the steel at the coating cutback and mainline coating, it resists shear forces imparted by soil pressure after the pipeline is buried and provides long term corrosion protection to the steel. The choice of which adhesive to use is based on the pipeline design and operating conditions. As an example, for small diameter flow lines operating at ambient temperatures, a soft mastic-based adhesive may be chosen, while on large diameter pipelines operating at higher temperatures, a hard, semi-crystalline hot-melt adhesive is used. The adhesive needs to be chosen based on its corrosion protection properties, adhesion strength, and resistance to shear forces imparted by pipe movement and the effects of soil pressures. The coated sheet is then cut into individual sleeves suitable for application on a pipeline Heat Shrink Sleeves in FEP and PFA, Holscot Fluoroplastics. As mentioned before, the sheet is stretched and wants to recover when heated, so a sealing strip or \\"closure\\" is applied during sleeve installation so that the sleeve will stay in place during and after recovery. =Epoxy Primer= A final component is an optional epoxy primer. Primers for heat-shrinkable sleeves work in the same manner as an FBE primer does when it is specified on 3-layer polyolefin pipeline coatings and is typically applied between 150 Œºm and 300 Œºm thick. Usually, the primer of heat shrinkable sleeve is two components non-solvent Epoxy, one is primer base and the other is curing agent.  Use  When steel pipelines are built, they commonly consist of 10~12m long sections of steel pipe that has had a corrosion protective coating applied to it in a factory. The factory will leave an uncoated area at each end of the pipe called a \\"cutback\\" so that when welding the pipe sections together, the coating is not damaged. Heat- shrinkable sleeves are applied onto the cutback at the field weld or \\"field joint\\" during the construction of a pipeline. As described above, the heat- shrinkable sleeves have an adhesive that sticks the sleeve to the cutback and the factory applied mainline coating and also acts as a corrosion protective layer. The backing provides mechanical protection against abrasion and soil stress forces after the pipeline is buried. Heat wrap tape may used in addition for pipe bends, or as an alternative method for wrapping the whole pipe.

It was purchased by local communities and the Trust for Public Land in 2015, with plans to reopen a smaller version of a ski area, and keep the rest of the mountain preserved. History The Mt. Ascutney Ski Club cut the first trail at Ascutney in 1938. Skiers initially had to hike up the mountain to be able to ski down the trail, now known as Screaming Eagle. In 1946, Catharine Cushman, with the help of others, began to develop real estate on the mountain, in essence opening Ascutney as a ski area. It wasn't until the second year, 1947, that two rope tows were installed to take skiers up the mountain. The first groomer was bought in 1947, while snowmaking was installed ten years later, when the ski area was owned by John Howland. Kurt Albert is the only man to ski 24 straight hours at Ascutney to raise money for charity in 2001. When Summit Ventures owned Ascutney, they invested $80 million into operating the resort, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1990. After three years of closure, Steven and Susan Plausteiner from New York City bought Ascutney for over one million dollars. Improvements under the Plausteiners include snowmaking coverage being expanded to 95% of the skiable area and installation of a high-speed detachable quad chairlift in 2000 from the bottom of the mountain to a new, higher peak. 2010 closure In 2010, rumors spread of severe debt and financial troubles on the part of the owners, the Plausteiners. In October 2010, the State of Vermont admitted that Ascutney Mountain had not yet filed for lift inspections, and the resort did not open for the 2010 winter. Despite the closure of the ski operations, the resort hotel at the base of the mountain, a Holiday Inn affiliate, continued to operate. Holiday Inn Club Vacations had no ownership ties to the ski operation. Following a protracted legal battle, Dan Purjes of MFW, the principal lien holder on the property, assumed ownership as the only bidder at an auction of the resort's assets in November, 2013. The high speed quad, known as the \\"North Peak Express,\\" was sold to Crotched Mountain, which installed it in 2012. The Triple Chairs were removed in 2014 and sold to Pats Peak ski area in Henniker, N.H. On January 8, 2015, the ski lodge burnt down, and has since been demolished. In 2017, Pats Peak re-installed the Snowdance Triple Chair, a CTEC Triple Chair that had operated as backup for the North Peak Express Quad, as the Peak Triple to replace a 1962 GMD Mueller Double Chair. In late 2015, a group of local residents with help from the Trust for Public Land purchased the area, a total of 468 acres, with plans to reopen a smaller, community ski area, keeping much of it preserved as open space.

History The Atelier 17 studio was formed as an experimental workshop for the graphic arts in Paris, France in 1927 by Stanley William Hayter (1901‚Äì1988). The studio was known for its collaborative atmosphere, with artists sharing ideas on technique and aesthetics. The studio was located at 17 rue Campagne-Premi√®re in Paris. By 1940 the studio's founder, Hayter, left Paris as World War II was starting. He moved to New York City and reopened his Atelier 17 studio there. Originally connected to the New School, by 1945 the studio was located as East 8th Street. The studio attracted many European artists who had fled from Europe and also introduced American artists to fine art printmaking. Hayter moved his studio back to Paris in 1950 where it continued to operate until Hayter's death in 1988. That year the studio was renamed Atelier Contrepoint and remains active. Techniques Atelier 17 artists worked with established and experimental techniques including multi-color printing and textured patterns.

Synopsis In December 1890, near the end of their collaboration, and still estranged by their famous carpet quarrel, W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan have neither seen nor spoken with each other in months. Now they must supervise a rehearsal for a revue of songs from their comic operas, a command performance for Queen Victoria at the Savoy Theatre. The underprepared show is set to open in about eight hours. Sullivan has been ill and has missed most of the rehearsals; he is in love with pretty Violet Russell, a young soprano of whom Gilbert disapproves. To make matters worse, Sullivan has invited Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh (a son of the Queen), to join the cast. The eager duke can't sing, dance or remember his cues.

The East Bank side of the ferry is near the end of paved roadway; on the West Bank the river road continues down to Venice, Louisiana. As the eastbank of Plaquemines Parish has little population in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ferry service to the eastbank occurs at the top of every hour between 6 AM and 10 PM, as well as at 6:30 AM. Likewise, ferry service to the westbank occurs at 6:15 AM, 6:45 AM, and on the bottom of every hour between 7:30 AM and 10:30 PM. History Ferry service began at this site in June 1933.

They were formalized after Lithuania regained independence in 1918, based on historic names, and celebrate natural phenomena; three months are named for birds, two for trees, and the remainder for seasonal activities and features. The days of the week are simply ordinal numbers. History The Gediminas Sceptre, a medieval Lithuanian calendarRussian, the right in Polish A Lithuanian language calendar by Laurynas Ivinskis Ancient Baltic cosmological schemes have been found on burial urns dated from 600-200 BC. As with other Bronze Age cultures, there were megaliths associated with the summer and winter solstices; hill enclaves with solar calendars have been discovered at Birutƒó Mountain near Palanga,Lithuanian archeoastronomy and at the Purmaliai mound near Klaipƒóda. A modern interpretation of the ancient solar calendar was created in 2002 at the Kretinga Museum. Lithuanian calendar shows some similarities with Slavic calendar, and so may have roots in Proto- Balto-Slavic era. The Gediminas Sceptre, discovered in 1680, indicates that during his reign the year started in April and was divided into 12 months, varying in length from 29 to 31 days. Each month began with a new moon; the weeks were nine days long The month names on this artifact are expressed in symbols, based on natural phenomena and agricultural cycles.Cosmology of the ancient Balts (i.e. the sidereal month was divided into three parts). The Julian calendar was used in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; the Gregorian calendar was adopted by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1586, a few years after its promulgation in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. In 1800, following Lithuania's annexation by the Russian Empire, the Julian calendar again became the norm, although a part of ethnic Lithuania left of Nemunas River (Suvalkija) retained the Gregorian calendar (see Aleksotas).Timeline of Lithuanian history The Russian Revolution of 1917 re-instated the Gregorian calendar, which had been the Western European standard for over a century, in January 1918. These changes caused some confusion before their usage became familiar.Lithuanian calendar from the 13th to 20th centuries Names of the months The standardization of month names was made difficult by the fact that publication in the Lithuanian language was illegal from 1864 to 1904 (see Lithuanian press ban) and some drift in the usages occurred. Month names are not capitalized in the Lithuanian language, reflecting their secular origins. * Sausis (January) derives from the adjective sausas, \\"dry\\". At this point in Lithuania's winter, precipitation is usually in the form of fine, dry snowflakes, and indoor humidity is very low. Its historic names included ragas, didysis ragutis, siekis, sausinis, and pusƒçius. * Vasaris (February) derives from the noun vasara, \\"summer\\". At this point, the days have begun to lengthen, there are occasional thaws, and thoughts and plans of summer reawaken. Its historic names were ragutis, kovinis, and pridƒótinis. * Kovas (March) may derive from either the noun kovas, the rook, or the noun kova, meaning battle. Rooks increase their activity at this time, building their nests and mating. The alternate derivation refers to the struggle between winter and spring. It was formerly known as morƒçius and karvelinis. * Balandis (April) is derived from balandis, the dove, which at this point has begun to coo, nest and mate. Earlier names included ≈æied≈≥, sultekis, gegu≈æinis, karvelinis, bir≈æƒótas, and Velyk≈≥. * Gegu≈æƒó (May) is derived from gegu≈æƒó, the cuckoo. Its call is felt to herald the final arrival of spring. Several folk beliefs are associated with this event. It was earlier known as gegu≈æinis, sƒótinis, sƒómenis, ≈æied≈æius, ≈æied≈≥, ber≈æelis, sultekis, milƒçius, and mildinis. * Bir≈æelis (June) is derived from ber≈æas, the birch, which flowers during this month. Birch branches are used as decorations during Pentecost. Its earlier names were visjavis, jaunius, ≈æienpjovys, sƒómenis, kirmƒóli≈≥, bir≈æis, mƒó≈°linis, and p≈´dymo. * Liepa (July) is derived from liepa, the linden tree, which flowers during this month; the flowers pleasantly scent the air, are used to make herbal teas, and attract honeybees. Older names for the month were liepinis, liep≈æiedis, plaukjavis, pl≈´kis, ≈°ienpj≈´tis, and ≈°ienpj≈´vis. * Rugpj≈´tis (August) is derived from rugiai, rye, and the verb pjauti, to cut. This staple Lithuanian grain is harvested then; before mechanization, this was performed with sickles. It was also known as degƒósis, pauk≈°tlƒókis, and pj≈´ties. * Rugsƒójis (September) is also derived from rugiai, with the suffix sƒóti, to sow. The grain is sown at this time, germinates, and overwinters in the fields, resuming growth in the spring. Other names for this month were rudenio, vƒósulinis, pauk≈°tlƒókis, ≈°il≈≥, rujos, strazdinis, rudugys, vir≈æi≈≥, sƒójos, veselinis, and vesulis. * Spalis (October) is derived from spaliai, flax hards. The plant was harvested at this time; it was and is used for fiber, food, and as a cash crop. The historic names for this month were vƒólinis, spalinis, lapkristys, visagalis, and septintinis. * Lapkritis (November) is derived from lapas, leaf, and kristi, to fall. Its older names include vƒóli≈≥, vƒólius, spalinis, lapkrƒóstys, lapkristys, grodis, gruodinis, and vilk≈≥. * Gruodis (December) is derived from the noun gruodas, which has no direct English equivalent; it may be described as \\"a frozen clod\\". Its older names include sausinis, vilkinis, vilk≈≥, and Kalƒód≈≥. Days of the week The days of the week are named in sequence, beginning with Monday. They are pirmadienis (\\"first day\\"), antradienis, treƒçiadienis, ketvirtadienis, penktadienis, ≈°e≈°tadienis, and sekmadienis. They are not capitalized.

Donna reprised her role in 90210 for a multi-episode arc in 2009. Auditioning When Tori Spelling auditioned for the role, she auditioned with a different last name, to avoid nepotism since her father was the series producer. Background Donna was introduced in the first season as Kelly Taylor's best friend. For the early part of the first season, the Donna character was a supporting role, but gradually became a main character with her own storylines. Donna grew up in a very wealthy Beverly Hills household, the only child of Dr. John Martin, a successful physician and her mother Felice Martin, a socialite. Donna grew up as a strict Catholic, and her mother's strict rules on morality would be a running storyline for much of the show. Because of this, Donna by choice remained a virgin for much of the show's run, until she was well into college. In high school, Donna discovered she had dyslexia and struggled at exams. She also almost failed to graduate after she was caught drinking alcohol at the senior prom. This led to a student demonstration to support her, and the slogan of her classmates \\"Donna Martin graduates!\\" would go on to become a pop culture catchphrase. Donna graduated from the show's fictional California University with a degree in Fashion & Marketing and would later go on to run her own fashion boutique. In the final season, Donna discovered that her cousin Gina Kincaid, with whom she had a troubled relationship, was actually her half-sister. Then, when Donna's father died, she blamed Gina for his death, but they eventually made up at the funeral. During the late 1990s, she and long time friend Kelly Taylor opened a clothing store called \\"Now Wear This\\". Relationships Donna first became romantically involved with David Silver in high school, after going to a dance together. After they had been dating for a couple of months, David tried to get Donna to have sex with him, at which point Donna admitted to being a virgin and revealed that she wanted to wait until marriage. David agreed to respect Donna's wishes, and they continued dating. David cheated on Donna the next summer, but he apologized. Finally, at the senior prom, Donna agreed to have sex with David, but was then caught drinking and her punishment disrupted their plans. The next year, David's pressures on Donna finally led her to agree to have sex with him, but she changed her mind at the last minute, and David got upset and broke up with her. David then started doing drugs, including crystal meth. and when Donna found out, she tried to help him. Because of this, Donna and David got back together. However, a few months later, Donna found David in the back of a limo, having sex with someone else and they split up once again. The following year after entering college, Donna met Griffin Stone (Casper Van Dien), and they began dating. Donna became romantically involved with Ray Pruit, a construction worker and budding singer. Donna was dating Griffin Stone while talking to Ray Pruit. Donna was then stuck with both guys but did not know whom to choose. She then dumped Griffin Stone for trying to sleep with her. Ray agreed to respect Donna's virginity, and wrote a song for her. Ray told Donna that he was not going to pressure her into doing anything she was uncomfortable doing. A few months later, a man named Garret Slan tried to rape her at knifepoint. She was rescued by David, but she and Ray continued dating. Donna and Ray celebrated the holidays together and their relationship got more intimate. Donna dated Ray for a year, but he eventually became abusive. He knocked her down a flight of stairs in Palm Springs but she lied about what happened and stayed with him. It was only when she learned that Ray had cheated on her with Valerie Malone that she broke up with him. She then got involved with Joe Bradley (Cameron Bancroft). A jealous Ray then started to harass the newly formed couple, but decided to drop the charges against Joe then he left town. Joe proposed to Donna, but she tearfully refused and they broke up. Finally, on their college graduation night, Donna and David had sex and decided to move in together, causing a rift with her mother over this decision. But when David forged a check using Donna's name, Donna broke up with him once again. She then had a serious romance with Noah Hunter, but that eventually ended and in the final season, she got back together with David again. Donna and David got married in the show's series finale in 2000. 90210 In episode 4 of the spin-off 90210, Kelly and Brenda crack a joke about being back at West Beverly and still hearing \\"Donna Martin Graduates.\\" Also, in conversation Kelly and Brenda mention that Donna has a baby and that it is \\"so cute.\\" It is revealed that Donna has returned to Beverly Hills after experiencing a rough patch in her relationship with David. Later on, Donna finds herself in a dilemma when she must decide between returning to Japan and being with David or moving back to Beverly Hills and bringing their daughter, Ruby, with her. =Recurring themes= One of the recurring themes of the show was Donna's many attempts to lose her virginity. Some TV and social critics have criticised the character for further stigmatising virginity. Reception Tori Spelling was often accused of getting the role of Donna Martin due to her father Aaron Spelling, the creator and executive producer of Beverly Hills 90210. The character has become part of a popular meme called \\"Donna Martin graduates\\".

It took place between 9 and 11 June 2006. The attendance was around 55,000 and the event was dubbed the biggest festival in England, because Glastonbury was on its break year. It was the last of three consecutive years of Nokia sponsorship, which saw the likes of The Who, David Bowie and R.E.M. grace the Island stage. New additions to the festival site included the Bandstand, which allowed local bands to perform, the Carling warm beer amnesty and the Strawberry fields a large area of bars and music venues. The festival achieved island-wide promotion by displaying the 2006 logo on Isle of Wight service buses. These buses were used to shuttle festival goers to a commemorative statue of Jimi Hendrix at Dimbola Lodge in Freshwater Bay near Afton Down (where the 1970 festival was staged). The festival was filmed and highlights were shown on late night broadcasts on Channel 4. Notable moments included Coldplay covering Lou Reed's 1972 song 'Perfect Day' during their Sunday night headline performance after the ex-Velvet Underground frontman failed to play it in his 'unpredictable' set earlier in the day. Coldplay singer Chris Martin told media that Lou Reed had asked them to do the cover to 'placate the crowd'. The Sunday also saw Procol Harum return to the festival for the first time since they played at the original version of the festival in 1970.

Released in the same year as The Concorde ... Airport '79 and featuring actor Joseph Cotten, who appeared in Airport '77, the film was an attempt by producers to take advantage of the success of the \\"Airport\\" film franchise of the 1970s.  Plot  L.P.A. Flight 820, a Concorde test flight, is sabotaged which forces the plane to crash land in the ocean off coast of Martinique in the French Antillies of the Caribbean. The only survivor is a Jean Beneyton (Mimsy Farmer), a French hostess on the flight. Two fishermen find her, but then are soon killed off by a group of suited corporate agents who ride out in a speedboat, because they were witnesses to the crash. In New York City, an American investigative reporter, Moses Brody (James Franciscus), receives a phone call from his ex-wife Nicole (Mag Fleming), who runs a local restaurant in Martinique, who tells him about an \\"important story\\". But upon arrival in Martinique, Brody learns that Nicole has died from an apparent \\"heart attack\\". Brody is devastated. Later that evening, while wandering the streets of the town, Brody is attacked by a gang of thugs, but is rescued by a mysterious local man named George, who owns a fishing trawler and tells him that Nicole was a friend of his and she was killed because she knew that the crashed Concorde flight landed on a reef nearby and the two of them decide to investigate. Meanwhile, a shady businessman named Milland (Joseph Cotten) and his business partner Danker (Edmund Purdom) learn about the Concorde crash and after consulting with their associate, Martinez, plot to cover up any evidence involved with the crash. It becomes apparent that Milland and Danker are behind the events. Brody and George are in a boat when they see Jean Beneyton jump off of the henchmen's boat and attempts to swim away before she is recaptured. Later, they arrive at the crash site and after donning scuba gear they find the wreck of the Concorde submerged under 100 feet of water in the Caribbean. While Brody goes inside the wreck, George gets his arm stuck in a jagged part of machinery and Brody has to amputate George's left arm to free him. Moses discovers explosive charges on the downed plane which were planted earlier by Milland's henchmen to destroy any evidence of foul play. Upon surfacing, George gets hit in the goggles by a bullet as several henchmen in a speedboat appear and attack. Brody is forced to go back down under the water with two scuba men in chase. Brody outwits them by hiding in an underwater cave in which he goes back to the surface and pulls out the henchman who remained behind in the speedboard and steals it. Brody then goes to the United States Consul of Martinique, and wants to start an investigation. He then takes them to the site and finds nothing. They call off the search for the missing Concorde. Brody then says that he saw Jean on a yacht. The Consul then says that if he knew it was Brody, he would have gotten him off the case as Brody was reporting a scandal concerning a Congressman. Meanwhile, Milland and his men watch a video as the submerged Concorde explodes. They then find out that Jean is alive and being held for a $1 million ransom. At the same time, another L.P.A. Concorde plane lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which prepares itself for a flight from Venezuela to London. That evening, Brody sneaks on board the henchmen's boat, where he overhears them saying that they want to get rid of Jean and also overhears them talking about their superiors taking down a second Concorde flight. Brody rescues her and they escape from the boat. After reaching the shore, Brody tries talking to Jean about the crash, but she is so shaken by the traumatic experience that she can't remember very much. In the morning, they hitch a ride on a banana truck driven by a local farmer. But soon Milland's henchmen, led by Forsythe (Venantino Venantini) find Brody and Jean again and give chase, but they are cut off by a construction vehicle. On board the airborne second Concorde, L.P.A. Flight 128, a crew member turns on one of the inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which same thing happened as with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts vials of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin. In Martinique, Brody calls the Consul and has Jean begin to tell her story about it, but they are cut off as the henchmen are back. As the Consul calls up his associates in London with his ideas to what might be happening, the chase continues. The Concorde then loses radio contact with London control, and the cabin lights begin to flicker. Captain Scott soon regains contact with London, who suggests they run a circuit control. The London air traffic controller (Robert Kerman) also gets a call from Jean. The controller then reports they can't reach the Concorde. On board the plane, the navigator (Roberto Santi) then reports that pressure in the main cabin is dropping. On the ground, Jean contacts the American Consul at a bank, but Forsythe and his henchmen arrive again, and she and Brody have to run. This time, the police are there and enter a shootout with the men in which all of the henchmen are killed. Meanwhile, London Air Traffic Control gets radio contact with the Concorde on a VHF frequence. Captain Scott on the Concorde then descends the aircraft to a lower altitude below 12,000 feet, but London now can't get Concorde on the VHF frequency, either. Brody and Jean reach the American Consul and she begins describing what happened. The Concorde banks and the number one engine overheats. London control reports that the crash began with overheating of the oven. The crew discovers the number one engine is now on fire, and they quickly extinguish it. The Concorde continues its descent, as one passenger becomes hysterical. The plane then levels out at 9,000 feet. London control can now see them on radar, and proceed to clear a runway. Concorde then makes a beautiful landing. Brody is relieved. The next day, Milland contacts Brody by phone where he wants to offer him a shady contract after reading the headline \\"Concorde Passengers Saved by Journalist\\". Jean thinks that he'll get a big welcome in New York. Brody jokingly states that he doesn't have to go, and they laugh. He says he has to pay a visit \\"to a certain bigshot\\". Jean then gets on an Air France flight to return to Paris, but before she leaves he says he'll give her a call. Brody then calls his friend Alfie and says that he wants to \\"push a certain Humpty Dumpty off his wall\\". He says he wants to know the heads of the top corporations in New York City, heavily involved in aircraft sales to South American countries, specifically those most hurt by competition from Concorde. The credits begin over footage of a Concorde in flight.

He is best known as the author of three books for parents: Boys Adrift, Girls on the Edge, and Why Gender Matters. According to his web site, he is currently employed as a physician at a healthcare facility in Chester County Pennsylvania, where he also resides. Biography Sax grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where he was the third of three children. Sax graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in biology. He completed the combined M.D.-Ph.D. program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. His Ph.D. is in psychology. He completed the 3-year residency in family practice at Lancaster General Hospital in 1989. In 1990, he founded Poolesville Family Practice, a primary care practice in Montgomery County, Maryland. He began an extended sabbatical from medical practice in June 2008. In December 2013, he returned to full-time clinical practice as an employee of Lancaster General Health.  Sax's views on gender  Sax's work has attracted most attention, positive and negative, for his views on gender. Broadly, he supports the notion of innate differences between the sexes, and advocates parenting children differently based on their gender. A 7 March 2005, cover story for Time Magazine included this statement: > \\"Until recently, there have been two groups of people: those who argue sex > differences are innate and should be embraced and those who insist that they > are learned and should be eliminated by changing the environment. Sax is one > of the few in the middle ‚Äì convinced that boys and girls are innately > different and that we must change the environment so differences don't > become limitations.\\" On his web site, Sax says that he wrote Boys Adrift and Girls on the Edge because he is concerned about > \\"... a growing proportion of girls who are anxious, depressed, and tired; > girls who can tell you a great deal about what they do but not so much about > who they are. Likewise, we find a growing proportion of boys who are > disengaged not only from school but from the real world. Those boys are > comfortable in the virtual world, where they play their online video games, > and/or surf the net for photographs of girls.\\" Cordelia Fine criticizes Sax's use of brain imaging in her talk that shared its name with her book, Delusions of Gender, at the 2010 Festival of Dangerous Ideas = Why Gender Matters (2005 edition) = Mark Liberman, a professor of linguistics and computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, questioned on his blog, Language Log, many of the claims which Sax made in his first book Why Gender Matters. Liberman asserted that there were serious problems with Sax's claims about sex differences in hearing, vision, and connections between emotions and language. Sax wrote to Liberman, and, receiving no reply, in October 2010 on the website of Why Gender Matters, Sax acknowledged that points in his book were \\"out-of-date or inaccurate\\" and that his work, which was initially published in 2005, has been clarified by studies published by third parties in 2007 and 2009. He now provides updated references to scholarly papers on these three issues and he \\"expanded, updated, and corrected\\" the discussion of sex differences in hearing with a new article, \\"Sex Differences in Hearing\\", in October 2010; and the discussion of sex differences in vision is updated in Chapter 5 of his book Girls on the Edge. Sax provides a detailed refutation of Liberman and other critics in two appendices to the 2017 edition of Why Gender Matters, titled \\"Sex Differences in Hearing\\" and \\"Sex Differences in Vision.\\" Conservative opinion columnist David Brooks calls Dr. Sax's first book, Why Gender Matters, \\"... a lucid guide to male and female brain differences.\\" = Boys Adrift (2007 edition) = Dr. Sax's second book, Boys Adrift, was reviewed by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in December 2007\\\\. According to the review, Boys Adrift is \\"powerfully and persuasively presented\\", and provides \\"excellent and informative references and information\\". The review concludes that > \\"Boys Adrift is at its strongest in providing practical advice to parents > about how to increase their sons' academic motivation; how to set > appropriate limits on video game use; and how to protect their sons from the > potential harm of psychotropic medications and environmental estrogens. Boys > Adrift is at its weakest in supporting the thesis that there is an epidemic > of unmotivated and underachieving young men.\\" = Girls on the Edge = Dr. Sax's third book Girls on the Edge was reviewed by Library Journal which called the book \\"... essential reading for parents and teachers, and one of the most thought-provoking books on teen development available.‚Äù Mark Bauerlein, professor at Emory University, reviewed Girls on the Edge for the Chronicle of Higher Education and called it \\"crucial\\" and said that \\"Parents of ‚Äòtween‚Äô and teen girls would do well to check this book.\\" Booklist called Girls on the Edge \\"persuasive, often fascinating ... a holistic, sobering call to help the current generation of young women develop the support and sense of self that will allow them to grow into resilient adults.‚Äù According to a January 2011 review in the Atlantic magazine, Girls on the Edge is \\"... the best book about the current state of girls and young women in America.\\" = Single-Sex Education Advocacy = Sax's advocacy of single-sex public education has also attracted criticism. In 2008, The New York Times Magazine published a lengthy piece written by freelancer Elizabeth Weil, about half of which is about Sax (the other half is about single-sex education at, for example, the Young Women‚Äôs Leadership School in Harlem, New York City). The article asserts that \\"many academics and progressives tend to find Sax‚Äôs views stereotyped and infuriating\\". The article cites criticism by Michael Younger of the University of Cambridge as well as by Liberman. Sax responded on the NASSPE website that Weil's article is \\"awash in misrepresentations and distortions\\". Sax' advocacy of single-sex education was also criticized in an article \\"The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling\\" by Diane F. Halpern and others. Bibliography =National and international media= Sax has contributed articles and made appearances in the popular media in a number of English-speaking countries. In the United States, Sax was a guest on the Today show during February 2005 and July 2007. Matt Lauer interviewed Sax about the controversy surrounding boys' achievement, which was the topic of the cover story in Time that week. Al Roker interviewed Sax about his book Why Gender Matters. In Canada, Sax was a guest in the Toronto studio of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for an interview broadcast nationwide in January 2008. In Australia, Sax was a guest in the studio for the Today Show, interviewed by Jessica Rowe. In New Zealand, Sax was a studio guest of New Zealand's Channel One in May 2008 for a discussion of single-sex public education. In the United Kingdom, Sax was the subject of a full-page feature article in The Times. In May 2010, Sax was a guest on CNN's American Morning, discussing his book Girls on the Edge and some of the challenges facing girls in the era of texting and Facebook. He returned as a guest on national television in New Zealand in August that year, discussing the girl-specific challenges of 'the cyberbubble'. He was again a guest on CNN's American Morning during the same month, discussing recent research suggesting that ADHD is over-diagnosed in American schoolchildren. =Popular press= * \\"Child psychiatry is sick with hidden conflicts of interest\\" New York Daily News December 14, 2008. * \\"The boy problem: why so many boys think reading is stupid and school stinks\\" School Library Journal September 1, 2007. * \\"Single- sex education: Separate but better?\\" Philadelphia Daily News, March 1, 2006. * \\"The Promise and the Peril of Single-Sex PUBLIC Education\\".

He was born in 1944 in Great Falls, a small town in South Carolina, United States. His interest and passion for art began at an early age, but because he grew up in a small town, he had no way to visit museums. After high school, Edmund Gaither attended Morehouse College in Georgia, only male historically black college in the United States. College was an extremely important time for Gaither, because it allowed him access to the artwork he had such a passion for, a population where he fit in, and an atmosphere to find himself. Gaither graduated Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts and went on to further his education at Brown University. He graduated from Brown with a Masters in Fine Arts in 1968. In 1969, Gaither became a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He went on to found the National Center of Afro-American Artists, located in Roxbury, Massachusetts. The Center has become a vitally important showcase of African-American artists and culture for Boston and the United States. A love for education led Gaither to develop a course on African- American art at which he served as a lecturer at various colleges across the nation. Some of these institutions included Spelman College (1968-1969), Massachusetts College of Art (1970-1971), Harvard College (1972-1975), and Wellesley College (1971-1974). Gaither also taught a course in African American studies at Boston University. He is a respected individual in the museum field and has served many positions, some including Commission on Museums for a New Century, Commission on Equity and Excellence, and Museums and Communities, American Alliance of Museums. Outside the museum world, he served on President George W. Bush‚Äôs Advisory Board on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Gaither was the first president of the African American Museums Association. References * Massachusetts Cultural Council. (2006). Commonwealth Awards.

(\\"The federal flag shall be black, red, and gold.\\"). As Germany was divided into West Germany and East Germany beginning in 1949 and continuing through 1990, both Germanies retained the black, red, and gold colors on each respective flag. After German reunification in 1990, West and East Germany adopted the West German flag as the flag of the reunited Germany, therefore maintaining black, red, and gold as Germany's colors. The colours ultimately hark back to the tricolour adopted by the Urburschenschaft of Jena in 1815, representing an early phase in the development of German nationalism and the idea of a unified German state. Since the 1860s, there has been a competing tradition of national colours as black, white, and red, based on the Hanseatic flags, used as the flag of the North German Confederation and the German Empire. The Weimar Republic in 1919 opted to re-introduce the black, red, and gold tricolour. This was controversial, and as a compromise, the old flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad. As a reaction, Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold was an organization formed in 1924 representing the parties supporting parliamentary democracy, and for the remainder of the existence of the Weimar Republic, black-red-gold represented the centrist parties supporting parliamentary and black-white-red represented its nationalist and monarchist opposition. Black, red, and gold = Supposed pre-modern origins = Henry VI, Codex Manesse The Reichsbanner of the Holy Roman Emperors as used from the 15th century The choice of black, red, and gold as national colours was retrospectively motivated by occurrence of this combination of colours in the medieval coat of arms of the Holy Roman Emperors, the black Reichsadler in a golden field used since the 12th century. The imperial colours black and gold were adopted by many imperial cities to underline their immediacy. The colours black, red, and gold were supposedly used at the election of Frederick Barbarossa as King of the Romans on 4 March 1152 in Frankfurt.George Henry Preble: The symbols, standards, flags, and banners of ancient and modern nations, prior to 1900, reprint: Flag Research Center, Winchester, USA. According to contemporary sources, the new king's way from Frankfurt Cathedral to the R√∂mer square was covered with a coloured carpet, which was afterwards cut into numerous small parts and distributed to the crowds. A red-clawed, -beaked and -tongued imperial eagle was used from the 14th century onwards, as depicted in the Codex Manesse about 1304. The Habsburg Monarchy used the colours black and gold as its dynastic flag from about 1700; when emperor Francis II abdicated from the throne in 1806, he adopted the colours as the flag of his Austrian Empire. The black-red-gold tricolour's first known appearance on a state flag, anywhere in a German-ethnicity sovereign state within what today comprises Germany, occurred in 1778. Following this documented \\"first-use\\" by the elder Reuss noble line of the modern tricolor combination, the connection of the black-red-gold tricolour with the Reichsbanner design appears to have been made as early as during the March Revolution. Ferdinand Freiligrath in his poem Schwarz-Rot-Gold, published 1851 and dated 17 March 1848, has the lines Das ist das alte Reichspanier, Das sind die alten Farben! (\\"This is the old imperial banner, these are the old colours!\\"), and in addition provides a symbolism for the colours as Pulver ist schwarz, Blut ist rot, Golden flackert die Flamme! (\\"Gunpowder is black, blood is red, golden flares the flame!\\"). Communist authors also attributed use of the colours by insurgents of the 1525 German Peasants' War, so Friedrich Engels in his The Peasant War in Germany (1850, p. 91), and Albert Norden, Um die Nation (1953, p. 17). = Wars of Liberation = Urburschenschaft banner (replica) Uniforms of the L√ºtzow Free Corps during the German campaign (1813‚Äì1814) against French occupation under Napoleon also consisted of a combination of black, red, and gold‚Äîthough mainly for functional reasons: the corps under command of the Prussian major Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L√ºtzow was made up of volunteer university students from all over Germany, whose varied clothing was uniformly coloured in black, festooned with common brass knobs and red facings. The Uhlan forces used red and black lance pennons. Black, red, and gold ‚Äì if even in reverse order compared to nowadays, i.e. gold at the top ‚Äì resembling the former imperial colours soon became symbols of the German struggle for freedom, symbolizing the road from servitude (black) through bloody fight (red) to the stars (gold), similar to the famous saying per aspera ad astra (to the stars through difficulties). This interpretive culture was perpetuated in the memory of venerated martyrs like Theodor K√∂rner. The red and black colours with a golden oak leaf cluster were adopted as couleur by the first German national Urburschenschaft student fraternity established on 12 June 1815 in Jena, and publicly displayed on the 1817 Wartburg Festival. The students' hopes of a national awakening dashed with the implementation of the German Confederation, not a nation state but a loose federation of the German monarchs, who by the 1819 reactionary Carlsbad Decrees banned any fraternity activities. Since then the black-red-gold tricolour became a widespread symbol of the pursuit of liberty, democracy and liberal unity, thus the colours were used on horizontal tricolour flags by L√ºtzow veterans and other democratic revolutionaries of the Hambach Festival in 1832, and in the Revolutions of 1848. = March Revolution = Germania As a result of the 1848 revolutions, the Federal Convention of the German monarchs, who had continued the use of the Imperial Eagle coat of arms in 1815, also adopted the tricolour (\\"from German time immemorial\\") in order to steady the nationalist unrest. Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria had the Black, Red, and Gold flag hoisted on St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and showed himself with the flag on a window of Hofburg Palace. In Berlin, King Frederick William IV of Prussia had to bow to the fallen insurgents of the liberation movement and to wear a Black, Red and Gold armband while riding through the city. When on 18 May 1848 the Frankfurt Parliament first convened, the city streets were decorated in the \\"German colours\\" like the assembly room in St. Paul's Church. On November 12, the parliament passed a resolution whereafter black-red-gold became the German war and merchant flag. However, as official flag of the German Confederation, the tricolour was mainly used in the small Imperial fleet (Reichsflotte), which was dissolved by 1852. The Frankfurt Constitution, adopted in 1849 and never carried into effect, omitted any provision of national symbols. After the dissolution of the Frankfurt Parliament, the tricolour vanished from public space. Mocked by Heinrich Heine as \\"old Germanic rubbish\\", it nevertheless remained the official flag of the German Confederation, \\"revitalized\\" in 1866 as the banner of Austria and her allies in the War with Prussia and the North German states.  Black, white, and red  North German merchant flag, 1868 After the war and the breakup of the German Confederation, the Prussian-led North German Confederation was established at the instance of Minister-President Otto von Bismarck to answer the German question. Another colour scheme was desired, as the black and gold colours were associated with Habsburg Austria. From 1867, the black, white, and red colours became the flag of the newly established federated state; the tricolour derived from the combination of the Prussian black and white with the white and red flag of the North German Hanseatic League. Since the 13th century, a black cross on white coat had been carried by medieval Teutonic Knights which had founded the State of the Teutonic Order in Prussia. Their Grand Master Hermann von Salza received the rights to bear the imperial black eagle by the 1226 Golden Bull of Rimini, issued by Emperor Frederick II, to indicate that he enjoyed imperial immediacy as a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. When the Teutonic state was secularized in 1525 as the Duchy of Prussia, the black eagle on a white shield became the Prussian coat of arms. The ruling House of Hohenzollern also had a black and white family coat of arms. In addition to the black and white of Prussia, the white and red colours of the former Hanseatic League were added. Even though this medieval international trade organization had lost its influence over two centuries earlier, the city-states of Bremen, Hamburg, and L√ºbeck, all former Free Imperial Cities, took pride in their centuries-old Hanseatic tradition. The navy commander Prince Adalbert of Prussia strongly advocated the implementation of a combined tricolour of Prussian black and white and Hanseatic white and red as a war flag and a civil ensign. Bismarck (\\"I don't care whatsoever about those colors! Whatever, green and yellow and dancing pleasure, or the flag of Mecklenburg-Strelitz...\\") made no objections. \\"One People! One Emperor! One God!\\", German postcard, about 1900 From the 1871 German unification until 1918, black, white, and red were widely accepted as the national colours of the German Empire, though they were not officially adopted as the imperial flag by law before 1892. Numerous German associations embraced the patriotic tricolour, and sports organisations that were founded prior to World War I often choose white with additional black and/or red as their colours.  State colours  In the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, the \\"imperialist\\" black, white, and red were abandoned in favour of the \\"democratic\\" black, red, and gold colours of 1848. In view of Germany's unfortunate position after the lost war and under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, monarchist and German National forces advocated the retention of the imperial colours as a matter of national pride. Since then, and up to today, black, white, and red are often associated with right wing radicalism because of their use by right wing parties and in far-right circles. = Weimar Republic = Though even liberal deputies in the Weimar National Assembly spoke against a change of colours, Article 3 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 determined black, red, and gold both for the tricolour national flag and the eagle coat of arms of the Weimar Republic. Considering the preceding debates however, the former black, white, and red colours were retained as the German civil ensign, with black, red, and gold in the upper left corner. Not until 1922, the Reichskriegsflagge banner was officially outlawed on ships of the German Navy. The official black, red, and gold colours were refused by wide circles in the Reichswehr armed forces and World War I veterans' associations. The issue of the national colours was, however, continuously debated in the German society. Studentenverbindung organisations emphasized the Greater German meaning of black, red, and gold, which had actually been frustrated by the Allied Powers prohibiting the accession of German-Austria to Germany. Most of the centrist political parties were in favour of the new colours, but many people of different political views still felt that black, white, and red were the true colours of Germany. The flag of the Weimar Republic was insulted by conservatives and nationalists, Communists and Nazis alike, who sometimes referred to it as \\"black-red-yellow\\" or even \\"black-red-mustard\\", if not even worse. In 1921, even Gustav Stresemann, chairman of the national liberal German People's Party argued for the reintroduction of black, white, and red. In May 1926, the German government of Chancellor Hans Luther had to resign after a quarrel over the display of flags at German embassies. To encounter antidemocratic forces, the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold society was founded by members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Catholic Centre Party, and the liberal German Democratic Party in 1924. Led by the Social Democrat Otto H√∂rsing, the defined goal of the organisation was to defend the colours and the parliamentary values they represented. Initially a league of World War I veterans, the Reichsbanner soon evolved to a mass organisation with a membership of more than three million. Increasingly attacked by the Sturmabteilung, Der Stahlhelm paramilitary groups, it joined forces with the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund and Allgemeiner freier Angestelltenbund trade unions to form the democratic Iron Front. With the Weimar democracy, the black, red, and gold colours went down fighting. = Nazi rule = Upon the Nazi Party's Machtergreifung when Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, the \\"democratic\\" colours quickly fell out of use, though they were not officially abolished. By order of March 7, two days after the German federal election, Reich President Paul von Hindenburg re-introduced black, white, and red as official decorations on the coming Volkstrauertag public holiday. Alongside the swastika flag of the Nazi Party, the imperial colours were restored as a provisional national symbol, subject to a final decision by the German government. The concurrent Nazi flag also used a combination of black, white, and red colours, but not in the same way as the old flag of the German Empire. Instead, red was the dominant colour. After Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler styled himself F√ºhrer and Reich Chancellor. By law of 15 September 1935 he declared black, white, and red again the national colours but made his own Nazi Party swastika the sole national flag and civil ensign of Germany. National conservative protests had become silent. In a speech, Reichstag president Hermann G√∂ring called the black, white, and red flag of the German Empire \\"honorably pulled down\\". = Post-war = The German Unity Flag is raised as national memorial to German reunification in front of the Reichstag in Berlin on 3 October 1990 After World War II, Germany was occupied and divided. Both new states founded in 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), took up the \\"democratic\\" colours of black, red, and gold again, with the GDR adding their own socialist symbols to their flag in 1959. As a compromise, the Olympic United Team of Germany, which had first competed in 1956, had to add white Olympic rings to the flag for the games of 1960 and 1964, and also for 1968 when two separate German teams entered under common symbols. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, East German citizens cut out the socialist symbols of the East German flag in order to show support for a unification with West Germany, which had also continued the use of the traditional eagle coat of arms, called Bundesadler. In the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949), and especially after the 1960s, only very far-right parties use black, white, and red, especially radical conservatives and neo-Nazis. Right-wing populist and national conservative parties, for example The Republicans, pointedly display black, red, and gold in their logo. Beside the right-wing extremists only the very small group of monarchists display the old colours.  Use of colours in sports  German rower Richard Nagel, wearing white with a red chest band German sports teams often use white as a main colour, as organisations that had been founded prior to 1919 often have chosen the Prussian colours: white with additional black and sometimes red. Examples are the German national football team fielded by the German Football Association (DFB) since 1908, German track and field athleteshttp://www.leichtathletik.de/index.php?SiteID=419 and rowershttp://www.rudern.de/ who use a red chest band, and German race cars, which were, according to the international auto racing colour scheme, painted white with red numbers (since 1934, Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union have used unpainted metal, or silver). Between 1918 and 1933, and after 1945, black-red- gold again became the national colours. Organisations founded in that time frame, such as the German American Football Association (AFVD)http://www.afvd.de/ or the German Organisation of Non-Olympic sports (IGNOV), often use black-red-gold in their colours, mostly on a white background. In recent years, most national teams of older organisations have added black-red-gold trim to their uniforms.

It was inaugurated in 2003, and all six events so far have been held at Toyota Speedway at Irwindale in suburban Los Angeles. Historically held in October or November, NASCAR moved the 2008 season event to January 23‚Äì24, 2009, after all of NASCAR's regional series had finished their 2008 seasons. The Showdown was cancelled in 2011. It was replaced starting in 2013 by the UNOH Battle At The Beach. 2006 format In 2006, the Showdown was a two-race card, as it had been throughout its brief history. One was for drivers in the AutoZone Elite Division, comprising the Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest divisions. The other was for drivers in the Grand National Division, which was made up of the Busch East and AutoZone West Divisions. The top 15 drivers in points in each of the two Grand National series comprised the field for that division's race for a total of 30, while the top 10 drivers in points in each of the four Elite series set the field for that division's race, or 40 in total. On Friday night, the fields were split in half and the drivers competed in qualifying races (akin to the Gatorade Duel) to determine the starting lineup for the following night's main event. The drivers with the worst position in their respective division's standings started at the front of the field, and the lineups were filled by alternating the series. (For example, a Northwest driver followed by a Southeast driver followed by a Southwest driver followed by a Midwest driver.) Drivers in the first race took the inside lanes for the Saturday main event, while those in the second race took the outside lane. All drivers entered automatically qualified for the main race. 2007 format The 2007 Showdown was held October 19‚Äì20, again at Irwindale Speedway, with a new two-day format. The first race became a 150-lap Super Late Model race held on the Friday night, with any Super Late Model racer who races in a NASCAR Whelen All-American Series track eligible for the event. The Grand National race featured major changes: * The race is 250 laps (held in 3 segments of 100, 100, and 50 laps with 10-minute breaks in between ‚Äì the only time cars are allowed to change tires except for flats or damage) and features a 40-car starting field. * Top 15 drivers in both Grand National divisions invited and receive bonus money. * Any driver approved by NASCAR to race in this division at tracks of one-half mile or greater may attempt this race. (Previously, only the top 15 in each division was eligible.) * Only exempt cars automatically qualified for the race. * Exemptions were awarded on the following (Any Grand National team may help these champions in other cars obtain a ride): ** Any Grand National race winner in 2007. ** All NASCAR Regional Series champions for 2007 *** Busch East Series *** NASCAR West Series *** Whelen Modified Tour *** Whelen Southern Modified Tour *** Canadian Tire Series *** Corona Series leader as of September 2 (Due to the race being before the NCS season ends; this problem was resolved with the 2008 season by moving the race to January 2009) *** Whelen All-American Series National Champion * These exempt drivers (minimum seven) will be added with the top cars from Friday qualifying to form a 30-car starting field. * A 50-lap last chance qualifier will establish the final ten cars for Saturday's 250-lap feature. The format change was required because the Elite Division is no longer in place. NASCAR disbanded the division after the 2006 season. 2008 season format A major criticism of the format was that because of the All-Star Showdown date, it could result in the race being held before certain major races (such as the ones at Phoenix International Raceway on Sprint Cup weekend) could be held before the Showdown. NASCAR had a problem with the Corona Series still in progress before the Showdown. Thus, NASCAR moved the race to January 2009 for the 2008 season champions, allowing the entire NASCAR season for regional racing to finish before running the Showdown. The 2008 season format will remain the same, with the Camping World East and West, Whelen Modified, Southern Modified, and All- American National, Canadian Tire, and Corona Series champions, and also race winners from the Camping World East and West series entered in the race. The 150-lap late model race on Friday continues. Rain interrupted the Showdown and forced all three races to be run on Saturday; however, only the Camping World Series race was run to its conclusion, with the race going past 10:30 pm. Although Joey Logano crossed the finish line first, he was penalized by NASCAR for rough driving after an incident with Peyton Sellers on the last lap, and dropped to 40th place. Matt Kobyluck, who crossed the finish line in second place was awarded the victory and became the first 2-time winner of the event. The Late Model race, a 75-lap race intended to run before the Camping World feature, was run afterwards, and hit the 40-minute time limit at 55 laps. The 150-lap Super Late Model race, intended for Friday, was run as a race that was after the Late Model race, and only ran until the 12:15 am curfew, which meant just 15 laps. 2009 season format The 2009 season's All-Star Showdown is set for January 30, 2010, again at Irwindale. All race winners during both Camping World Series regional tours, in addition to the Series Champions of both Camping World Series, both Whelen Modified Tours, Canadian Tire Series, and Mexico Series, and the top five in the Whelen All-American Series National Standings (all must be state champions ‚Äì new for the 2009 season; in previous years, it was only the National Champion), will be awarded exemptions to advance to the feature. Qualifying, provisionals for Camping World Series regulars based on the 2009 results, and top drivers in the qualifying race will determine the starting order. For the 2009 season version, the Super Late Model race (100 laps) will have the top five NASCAR Whelen All-American Series state champions automatically qualified. The Late Model race (75 laps) will continue. Nick Joanides, the 2009 Late Model and Super Late Model division champion in the same season was the only driver entered in all three series, including the Camping World Series race where he won the Coca-Cola Move of the Race award. 2010 season format The 2010 NASCAR season concludes with the All-Star Showdown for January 29, 2011, again at Irwindale. The format again will carry the 225-lap K&N; Pro Series (the new name for the Grand National Division for the 2010 season) race as the feature, with two 100-lap segments and a 25-lap final segment. All K&N; Pro Series race winners, both regional series champions, and champions of the Canadian Tire Series, Corona Mexico Series, and Whelen All-American Series are invited. For the 2010 season version, the Super Late Model race (75 laps) will have the top five NASCAR Whelen All-American Series state champions automatically qualified. The Late Model race (50 laps) will continue. Both the Super Late Model (25 laps) and Late Models (20 laps) will have qualification determined by heat races.‚Äì 2010 season edition of NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown Winners NOTE: Beginning with the 2008 NASCAR Camping World Series (now K&N; Pro) season, the race is run in January of the ensuing year of the season listed, similar to the NFL Playoffs. Entry forms for this race since the 2008 season race (held January 2009) specifically state this is a 2008 NASCAR season race. Also, the Late Model and Super Late Model races are also run under the previous season's rules and regulations and do not count towards the track's new season, as the new season for these series does not start until late March or early April. As such, the January 2011 races are 2010 season events, and NASCAR lists the January 2010 race as part of the 2009 season.

Ten film adaptations were also made. Its premise was conceived by Joseph Medill Patterson, but the stories and artwork were by Martin Branner, who wrote the strip for over 40 years. It was one of the first comic strips about working women. The main character was a young woman who had to support her parents and adopted brother, serving as a reflection of the changing role of women in society. It ran in more than 100 newspapers and translations of the strip's Sunday pages were made available in Europe, focusing on her little brother Perry Winkle and his gang. Due to its originality and longevity, Winnie Winkle became a household name and inspired Roy Lichtenstein. It was reprinted in Dell Comics, and some see it as heralding a more independent role for American women after World War I.  Publication history  The Chicago Tribune Syndicate launched the comic strip on September 20, 1920. By 1939, Winnie Winkle was running in more than 140 newspapers. It was titled Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner until 1943. By 1970, Winnie Winkle still ran in more than 150 newspapers. Winnie Winkle had a topper strip on the Sunday page, originally called Looie Blooie when it debuted on January 11, 1931, and shortened to Looie on May 6, 1934. This was based on Branner's short-lived 1919 daily strip, Looie the Lawyer. As a topper, Looie ran for three decades, until 1962. From 1935 to 1936, there was also a paper-doll panel in the topper with several different titles: Winnie Winkle Fashion Cut-Outs, Winnie Winkle Style Story and Winnie Winkle Fashion Film Cut-Out. Winnie Winkle ended July 28, 1996, after 76 years, one of the longest runs in American comic strip history. Tribune Media Services, the syndicate that distributed the comic strip, \\"felt that the Winnie Winkle character was not recognized as a contemporary role model for the '90s.\\" At the time, the strip was carried by only a handful of newspapers. Characters and story The eponymous character Winnie Winkle was a young, unmarried woman who had to support her parents, making it the second popular comic strip about working women (after Somebody's Stenog, which debuted in 1918). But Somebody's Stenog, featuring secretary Cam O'Flage and her female officemates, debuted on December 16, 1918: It was a reflection of the new role of women in society, as could also be seen in comics such as Tillie the Toiler from 1921. Writing for the Associated Press in 1993, Hugh A. Mulligan noted, \\"After women got the vote and joined the work force, family-centered comics were joined by working-girl strips like Winnie Winkle, Tillie the Toiler, Dixie Dugan, Somebody's Stenog and Brenda Starr, which was drawn by a woman, Dale Messick. Almost from the beginning, politics and a social conscience hovered over the drawing board.\\" During its first years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new character was introduced in the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood. The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as \\"loafers.\\" One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase \\"Youse is a good boy, Denny.\\"Cartoonacy: Denny Dimwit Winnie Winkles Denny Dimwit has not been forgotten. In recent years, the character has been referenced several times in Bill Griffith's Zippy the Pinhead comic strip.Griffith, Bill. Zippy the Pinhead, December 19, 2005. Other major plot elements were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and the disappearance of Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqu√© for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including a stint in the Peace Corps. Artists Branner employed a number of assistants, including Royal King Cole (during the 1930s), Rolf Ahlson, Mike Peppe, and Max Van Bibber (1938‚Äì1962). Another assistant was the young French author Robert Velter, who on his return to Europe created the famous series Spirou et Fantasio. From 1941 until 1958, Branner's assistant was John A. Berrill, who later created Gil Thorp. After Branner suffered a stroke in 1962, Van Bibber continued the series until 1980, later followed by students from the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art and finally by veteran artist Frank Bolle. Bolle (who enlisted Leonard Starr to write the strip in 1985)Carlson, Mark. Winnie Winkle‚ÄìThe Saga of America‚Äôs Working Girl recalled: :I did Winnie Winkle for 20 years, and when they told me, \\"You have 90 days to wrap it up,\\" because they were discontinuing it, I felt terrible, but after I finished it, I didn't even miss it. I was depressed because I lost a good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but I have a lot of good memories of doing that strip.Petrilak, Joe. Frank Bolle Interview International spin-offs and translations In 1923, Winnie's adopted younger brother Perry Winkle and his friends the Rinkydinks became the focus of the Sunday pages. In Europe, only the Sunday pages were translated. In Holland and France, local artists made new comics about Perry when the number of weekly pages by Branner was no longer sufficient. * The Dutch translated the strip as Sjors van de Rebellenclub which became very popular in the Netherlands, where it was the predecessor of the long-running series Sjors en Sjimmie by Frans Pi√´t. * In France, it was known as Bicot and published by Hachette in 14 albums between 1926 and 1939. * In Flanders, Belgium the series De Vrolijke Bengels by Willy Vandersteen and De Lustige Kapoentjes by Marc Sleen were directly inspired by this strip.VAN HOOYDONCK, Pieter, ‚ÄúWilly Vandersteen: de Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal‚Äù, Standaard Uitgeverij, Antwerpen, 1994, page 67-68, 87, 88, 89, 95, 113, 116, 118, 125, 130, 175, 177, 183. * The Sunday page of Winnie Winkle was the first American comic published in a Yugoslavian daily newspaper, Jutarnji list from Zagreb. It first appeared on August 5, 1923, and lasted until April 1941, the beginning of World War II in that country. Perry, the hero, was renamed \\"Ivica\\" (Johnny), and Winnie \\"Suzana.\\" The Rinkydinks were rechristened \\"Rantanplanci,\\" allegedly after a group of kids from a contemporary Hollywood film series. The title was Pustolovni Ivica (\\"Adventurous Johnny\\"). A single Christmas episode taking place in Zagreb was published, the work of unknown local authors. Three albums collected the stories published in the newspaper. Films From 1926 to 1928, ten Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner movies were produced, written by Branner and starring Ethelyn Gibson as Winnie, with Billy West as director. # Working Winnie (1926) # Happy Days (1926) # Winnie's Birthday (1926) # Oh!

It is open seasonally from May to September and opens for special events taking place September to March. The Burnaby Village Museum is a reconstructed 1920s village, containing 31 full scale buildings; its costumed staff demonstrate traditional trades. The museum spans of land. Some of the buildings are original heritage buildings, moved from other locations in the community and restored. Others are replica buildings, created to house specific displays and artifacts, including a 1912 B.C. Electric Railway interurban tram. The Museum is also known for the 1912 C. W. Parker Carousel, available for visitors to ride.Burnaby Village Museum History Founded in 1971, the Museum was originally known as the Heritage Village. It has grown from a site with a small number of displays, to a heritage site and major attraction in Metro Vancouver. On November 19, 1971 the official opening of the museum took place, officiated by Roland Michener, then Governor General of Canada. Over 15,000 visitors attended the museum during its special three-day opening. It opened for its first season in 1972, and included several shops located in replica buildings on the main street, and the \\"manor house\\" (the 1922 home of the Bateman family, today known as Elworth). Livestock was part of the display, including horses who were shod in the blacksmith shop. An early promotional brochure promised visitors they would be able to \\"smell the burning hoof.\\" In 1975, the B.C. Society of Model Engineers opened a model railway at the Village. The same year, a Chinese Herbalist display was opened, and a 1911 bachelor's house built by Burnaby resident Tom Irvine was moved to the site. In 1976, the Royal Bank building from Britannia Beach was moved to the Village, as well as a 1927 Burnaby heritage building set up as a real estate and surveyor's office. In partnership with the Japanese-Canadian Citizens Association, an ofuru (Japanese bathhouse) display was opened at the Village in 1977. The replica ofuru was built to commemorate the arrival in B.C. of the first Japanese immigrant in 1877. The Vorce B.C. Electric railway station was also acquired in 1977. In 1979, the Heritage Village became the set for the Canadian/German co-production of the 26-part TV series Huckleberry Finn and His Friends. In 1984, the Museum's name was changed from \\"Heritage Village\\" to \\"Burnaby Village Museum\\" to reflect its role as Burnaby's community museum. Iredale Partnership was hired in 1985 to create an expansion concept for Burnaby's Municipal Council to consider. The plan was completed in 1986, and accepted by Council in 1987. At that time, the site was expanded to approximately 9 acres, with new lands across Deer Lake Brook made available to the Museum to expand, and to create a new entrance facility and administration building. In 1987 the Seaforth School display was opened at the Village, with the restored 1922 school open to the public. By 1989, the popular \\"3R's\\" school program was being offered on a regular basis at the schoolhouse. In 1988, the 1893 Jesse and Martha Love farmhouse was acquired and moved to the Museum, to be part of the \\"rural zone\\" display established in the newly acquired museum space across Deer Lake Brook. In 1989, the miniature railway moved to Confederation Park. That same year, the PNE's historic carousel was decommissioned. The Friends of the Carousel were formed to raise the money to purchase and restore the 1912 carousel. Burnaby promised to provide a building for the carousel at the Burnaby Village Museum. In 1990, the Municipality of Burnaby took over operation of Burnaby Village Museum from the Century Park Museum Association. In 1993 the C.W. Parker Carousel was officially opened, housed in the newly constructed Don Wrigley Pavilion. The Museum's popular \\"Business as Usual\\" school program was launched in 1999, with \\"Home Sweet Home\\" following soon behind in 2000. In 2000, the museum opened its \\"Stride Studios\\" temporary exhibit gallery, allowing for temporary exhibits that explored topics beyond Burnaby in the 1920s to be featured as part of the visitor experience. In 2001, the Museum's 1912 British Columbia Electric Railway interurban tram was moved offsite to a warehouse, where it would undergo a 5-year restoration project by the Friends of Interurban 1223. In 2007, the restored Interurban 1223 was returned to the Museum, and installed in the newly constructed tram barn. Vorce station was installed adjacent to the tram barn, and was restored to its original appearance in 2008 under the auspices of the City of Burnaby Community Heritage Commission. The Burnaby Village Museum was an official stop for the Olympic Torch Relay in 2010. In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Museum, Burnaby City Council agreed to offer free admission to museum visitors for the 2011 summer and Christmas seasons.

Widely considered as one of the most respected and most acclaimed Argentine comedians by the public and critics.http://noticiasesquel.com.ar/noticiasesquel/el-profesor-patagonico-la- pelicula-que-trajo-a-luis-sandrini-y-piero-a-esquel/ He has made over 80 appearances in film between 1933 and 1980.  First Years  He was born in the neighborhood of Caballito and was the son of Genovese immigrants. His father was a theatrical actor, and Luis began to work in a circus next to his parents, like clown. In the 1930s he entered the theatrical company of Enrique Mui√±o and El√≠as Isaac Alippi, where he met his first wife, the actress Chela Cordero. Made his debut in the cinema in 1933 acting in the first Argentine sound film Tango (film) (directed by Luis Moglia Barth) in which he worked with a great of the theater of magazines like Pepe Arias and the stars of the tango Libertad Lamarque, Azucena Maizani, and Tita Merello,http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2024654-tita-merello-y-luis-sandrini-un- amor-con-la-melancolia-del-tango with the last one he had a romance when they filmed the film Juan Tenorio. He also appeared on the radio, where he made Felipe, who was the prototype of Buenos Aires nice man, creation of Miguel Coronatto Paz, who was so successful that years later was taken to television on Channel 13, where he shared screen with other great comedians as Tato Bores, Alberto Olmedo, Pepe Biondi, Jos√© Marrone, Carlos Bal√°, Dringue Far√≠as, and Juan Carlos Altavista, among others.http://noticiasesquel.com.ar/noticiasesquel/el-profesor-patagonico-la- pelicula-que-trajo-a-luis-sandrini-y-piero-a-esquel/ In the theater he made Cuando los duendes cazan perdices, then taken to the movies, and, behind the scenes, was astonished by the beauty of the young actress Malvina Pastorino whom he married. This resounding success made him become the most representative figure of the golden age of Argentine cinema; which then became entrenched in the film that inaugurated the \\"hotel accommodation series of the sixties\\", which was Daniel Tinayre's La Cigarra no es un Bicho. His last appearances were in costumbristas familiar films of Enrique Carreras. He died when he filmed the movie, My Family's Beautiful!, by Palito Ortega, where he worked alongside another great of the show, Nin√≠ Marshall. Luis Sandrini in popular culture Luis Sandrini by Annemarie Heinrich, c. 1948 Luis Sandrini knew to conquer the heart not only of the people of his country but also the rest of the Hispanic world due to the great characterizations of his personages, by which the films in which this great comedian act are known by all like the films of Sandrini, standing out from the rest of the cast and even overshadowing the directors of the films. Even famous expressions of his characters have passed into history, like that well-known of his film \\"Cuando los duendes cazan perdices\\": \\"¬°La vieja ve los colores!\\" (Literally: \\"The old lady sees the colors!\\"). He was highly praised for his characterizations and his characters have given people talk even many years after the first releases of his films. The TV program Peter Capusotto y sus videos features a character played by Diego Capusotto called Bombita Rodr√≠guez, who is believed to be inspired by Professor Tirabombas or Professor Hippie, both of Sandrini. Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010, recalls Sandrini in a passage in his novel Who Killed Palomino Molero?: \\"Lituma and the lieutenant had been at the movies, watching an Argentine film by Luis Sandrini, which made people laugh a lot, but not at them.\\" Mexican comedian Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os, Chespirito, in his memoirs, says about Sandrini:Among the prizes and recognitions that he obtained they count the Argentine Academy of Cinematography Arts and Sciences Award to the best actor in 1950 por The Fault the Other One Had, and a special mention in 1949 \\"for his brilliant performance in the Argentine cinema\\", the Silver Condor Award for Best Comedian in 1950 for Don Juan Tenorio and Juan Globo, the Silver Condor for Best Actor in 1954 for La Casa Grande and in 1972 for La Valija, and the 1981 Honour Konex Award, the latter posthumously.

It depicts the lives of labourers who extract salt from the sea off the Araya Peninsula in Venezuela. Their method for extracting salt, virtually unchanged for centuries, depends on gruelling physical labor, but provides a dependable, if meagre, living for the men and their families. The film ends with a recently built plant for mechanised salt extraction that could eliminate the community's traditional source of income.  Filming  Araya was produced by a two-person crew consisting of Margot Benacerraf and her cameraman Giuseppe Nisoli. On arriving at the arid and barren landscape of the Araya peninsula on the north coast of Venezuela Benacerraf remarked it was like \\"arriving on the moon\\". Although colour photography was available to Benacerraf and Nisoli, the decision was made to shoot in black and white, as it was deemed a more powerful way of portraying the subjects. The Soundtrack to Araya includes sounds from the sea, remixed in diverse ways including playing in reverse. Benacerraf noted that the Andalusian polos songs, rare in Venezuela, had lasted due to the extreme isolation of the Araya community.  Reception  The film was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, where it shared the Cannes International Critics Prize with Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour. The audience at Cannes doubted Benacerraf's claim that the film has been shot by a two-man crew, especially due to the dramatic shots from a crane, Benacerraf responded that they had merely made use of a vacant crane left at the mine. In 2009, Milestone Films released Araya in North American theaters for the first time as well as rereleasing it internationally. Milestone also distributes a restored DVD version of the film.

The festival is celebrated for two days and ends up with march past of dhulev jawans Main Temple Kesariyaji Tirth The temple is dedicated to Lord Rishabh dev. The temple is very artistic. Its pinnacles, arches, doors, walls are very artistic, beautiful and fascinating. The fifty two pinnacles of the temple are seen from a long distance. The main temple of Atishaya Teerth Kshetra Rishabhanatha is very attractive, magnificent and artistic having 52 beautiful spires on it. It is believed to be built in 9th century. According to Jain's opinion, as a symbol of Nandishwar Dweep's 52 temples, this temple was constructed having 52 spires. This temple is constructed scientifically according to the art of architecture. Just before the courtyard and in front of the main temple there is an idol of Marudevi Mata, the mother of Lord Rikhabdev, seated on a marble elephant. =Construction style= The first gate of the temple in the form of Vaikarakhana. The square of outer orbits comes from the temple of Dakshar Khel. It is also there on the other entrance. There is an elephant of black stone standing at both the doors. Aahwankund near the elephant On the north side, where Durga is worshiped in the days of Navratri, one of the two sides of the upper door is Brahma and the other is Shiva idol. There is an arrangement for going to this temple through the stairs. There is a statue of Marudevi sitting on the middle of the middle of the pavilion above the sidewalk. The platform of Lord Bhagwad Gita is made on the left side ahead of the stairs, where the story of Bhagwat is in chaos. Due to 9 columns, it is known as the nine-poster.

Two oxen are carved in the center of the simhasana (platform) of the main idol, which also has 14 dreams of the mother of Tirthankar. Surrounding the main deity, there are 23 idols, 2 standing and 21 seated, in an ashtadhatu (composed of eight metals) parikar. Here, pilgrims are bound to be lost in unstinted devotion; both Jain and non- Jain visitors and pilgrims experience a sort of sacredness, thanks due to the simply indescribable aura of the image of Shri Prabhu. The round face of Shri Prabhu is extremely attractive and pleasing to the mind.

All Hindu castes and Jain sects have been offering prayers here since a long time ago, the management of the temple is done by the state Government. = History = The history of the temple is not known clearly. Different communities put their own version of it. There are many beliefs regarding the antiquity and history of this splendid, miraculous and extraordinary idol. It was very much worshipped in the times Bhagawan Munisuvrat Swami. In course of time, it appeared under a banyan tree outside Vatpradnagar. It was worshipped for some years. Again it appeared under a tree at distance of one kilometer from the village. This is the Chief Tirth of Jains in the Mevad State. A fair is held here every year on the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Fagan. With all the five fingers, people worship God here with saffron. They give a gift of saffron to God. Bhils, know God by the name of 'Kalababa'. Non - Jain devotees come here with faith. Since centuries, there is a custom of giving saffron to God as a gift. Sometimes so much saffron is plastered on God, that God looks saffron - colored. People, therefore, call God Kesariyanath. =The temple and the Maharanas of Udaipur= Udaipur became the capital of the Sisodias in 1559. The revival of the fortunes of the Sisodias was made possible by the Jain ministers, like Bhamashah, who provided funds to reestablish the Maharanas after they had to leave Chittor. Because of significant Jain influence, the Maharanas became devotees of Lord Rishabh and worshipped here. They also made gifts to the temple. Maharana Fateh Singh (1884‚Äì1930) presented a jewel-studded angi (coat) to the temple which is used on special occasions costing one hundred thousand rupees. The administration was handed over to the government after India's independence. =The temple dispute= The nature of the temple has been in issue between Digambara, Swetambers and other Hindus. However, the Supreme Court of India in its judgment delivered in 'The State of Rajasthan & Ors. Vs. Shri Sajjanlal Panjawat & Ors.' [reported as (1974) 1 SCC 500] has, after considering the material produced, decided that it is a 'Jain temple' [see para. 12 at pg. 509/510 SCC]. However, since the right to manage the said temple had been taken over by the State of Mewar before promulgation of the Indian Constitution, therefore, Jains had no right to manage the temple after the Indian Constitution came into force. For that reason, it was held, that the Jains had no right to protect under Article 25/26 of the Indian Constitution. The issue of management of the said temple was again cropped up, and Digambers, Swetambers, Hindus and the State of Rajasthan again brought the matter in the Supreme Court of India, claiming to have the right to manage the temple. However, this time on the strength of 'Rajasthan Public Trust Act', which says that those temples to which chapter X of the said Act is applicable, would be managed by a Committee constituted from the persons interested in the management. That case was decided by a Bench of the Indian Supreme Court and Hon'ble Justice S.B. Sinha and Hon'ble Justice Markandey Katju vide in the judgment dated 4 January 2007, delivered in Civil Appeal No.4092-95 of 2002 titled as \\"Deewan Singh & Ors. vs. Rajendra Prasad ARdevi & Ors\\". Other connected Civil Appeals, confirmed the judgement of Single Judge (which was modified by the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court) and ordered that the management of the said temple be handed over to the committee, as envisaged under Section 53 of the 'Rajasthan Public Trust Act' within four months. A 2007 Supreme Court decision to hand over the administration to the Jain community had led to protests and violence by the local tribals.Fresh violence rocks Udaipur town, IBN Live, 9 February 2007 http://www.ibnlive.com/news/cops-fire-on-udaipur- protest-1-killed/top/33164-3.htmlArmy alerted, Hindu, 9 Feb 2007, http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/09/stories/2007020916490500.htm : \\"The revenue earned by the temple was also perhaps the main issue behind the legal tangle and the current confrontation, in which tribal people have been used as cannon fodder. The temple complex lies on 378 hectares of land and houses a guest house as well. Its moveable property alone is said to be valued at about Rs. 510 million. It is estimated that on an average 2,000 devotees visit Rishabdeo every day. : \\"The temple's eight Brahmin priests share the bulk of the offerings. : \\"The priests insist that the management cannot be handed over to the Jain community. \\"Where will we go?

Because of this self interest, the group of priests do not want the management to go to the Jains.\\" Bhaskar reported the anonymous pamphlets were distributed among the tribals to incite them. The violence had erupted on 7 February 2007, when several hundred tribals attacked the members of the Jain community and destroyed theirs shops, houses, cars, etc. The police were unable to contain the destruction after the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. One person was killed in the police firing. There is pressure being put on the state government not to implement the Supreme Court decision. This has been causing alarm in the Jain community.

Rotary feeders are primarily used for discharge of bulk solid material from hoppers/bins, receivers, and cyclones into a pressure or vacuum- driven pneumatic conveying system. Components of a rotary feeder include a rotor shaft, housing, head plates, and packing seals and bearings. Rotors have large vanes cast or welded on and are typically driven by small internal combustion engines or electric motors. Use Rotary airlock feeders have wide application in industry wherever dry free-flowing powders, granules, crystals, or pellets are used. Typical materials include: cement, ore, sugar, minerals, grains, plastics, dust, fly ash, flour, gypsum, lime, coffee, cereals, pharmaceuticals, etc. Industries requiring this type include cement, asphalt, chemical, mining, plastics, food, etc. Rotary feeders are ideal for pollution control applications in wood, grain, food, textile, paper, tobacco, rubber, and paint industries, the Standard Series works beneath dust collectors and cyclone separators even with high temperatures and different pressure differentials. Rotary valves are available with square or round inlet and outlet flanges. Housing can be fabricated out of sheet material or cast. Common materials are cast iron, carbon steel, 304 SS, 316 SS, and other materials. Rotary airlock feeders are often available in standard and heavy duty models, the difference being the head plate and bearing configuration. Heavy duty models use an outboard bearing in which the bearings are moved out away from the head plate. Housing inlet and discharge configurations are termed drop-thru or side entry. Different wear protections are available such as hard chrome or ceramic plating on the inner housing surfaces. Grease and air purge fittings are often provided to prevent contaminants from entering the packing seals. Uses *Rotary airlock The basic use of the rotary airlock feeder is as an airlock transition point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas while maintaining a flow of material between components with different pressure and suitable for air lock applications ranging from gravity discharge of filters, rotary valves, cyclone dust collectors, and rotary airlock storage devices to precision feeders for dilute phase and continuous dense phase pneumatic convey systems. *Rotary valve Rotary airlock feeders/ rotary airlock valves are used in pneumatic conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls. *Volumetric feeder Rotary airlock valves are also widely used as volumetric feeders for metering materials at precise flow rates from bins, hoppers, or silos onto conveying or processing systems. Types =Angle of Repose rotary Feeders= ARF is a variable speed rotary feeder for bulk materials that works in harmony with the natural flow of the material being fed. The ARF, using a rotating member and articulable gate, controls the volume of material flow based on the material's inherent angle of repose. The speed of rotation and the positioning of the articulable gate provides a consistent feed of your material. Drum rotation allows the material to be gently fed without retarding material flow, while minimizing surge loading, product degradation, dust generation and maintaining uniformity of material flow. =Rotary airlock feeders= Drop through rotary airlock feeders are designed for rugged applications that require an outboard bearing style unit where contamination and /or an abrasive product cannot be handled with an inboard bearing style. The outboard bearing feeders is engineered for use in high pressure pneumatic conveying systems, with high temperatures where more of an effective seal is required due to high or excessive wear that is experienced with a simple dust collector. =Blow-thru rotary airlock feeder= The blow-thru rotary airlock feeder is ideal for pneumatic conveying applications in food, grain, chemical, milling, baking, plastics and pharmaceutical industries. The blow-thru airlocks feature a low profile with large capacity. High pressure differentials integral mounting feet, and retrofit competitive units. The blow-thru valves are available with 10-vane open-end rotor; outboard bearings and replaceable shaft seals. =Rotary airlock feeder degassing= Rotary airlock feeders are very often installed to dose material in a pneumatic conveying line. As a consequence, a lot of gas coming from the conveying line is brought upstream by the rotation of the valve and the leakages in between the rotor and the stator. In order to have a functional system and a good flow of material, a small hopper equipped with a filter is very often connected to the feeder. The air can then be vented and the product admitted to the valvehttp://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Airlock_Rotary_Valve.html. = Easy clean rotary feeder = The easy-clean series rotary feeders can be fast and simply disassembled, thoroughly quick cleaned, sanitized and inspected or maintenance in a minimum amount of time without the use of tools or removal from service, thereby reducing downtime and increasing system production. Reassembly without tools is accomplished in minutes. Internal clearances are automatically re-established every time. The Clean-in-place rotary feeder is a special purpose valve designed for where cross- contamination is a major concern and lengthy shut-downs for clean-out are cost-prohibitive, suited for Dairy, Pharmaceutical industries, Food, Baking, Chemical, Plastics, Paint, and Powder Coating plants. It is ideal for batch mixing systems such as those handling different colored resins which demand regular cleaning between cycles. = Filter valve = The filter valve is a low-cost solution designed for light duty dust collector applications. = Knife rotary feeder = This type of feeder is used for discharge of secondary fuel as for example: plastics or wood. The knife is cutting the oversize material and is preventing the rotor from blockage.

It shares its name with the original city of Sybaris () which was destroyed in 510 BC. Its former inhabitants built a new city, Thurii, not far from the site of Sybaris. This new colony was founded together with other Greek settlers in 446/445 BC. Soon a conflict arose between the two groups and most of the Sybarites were killed by the other Greek colonists of Thurii. The Sybarites who managed to flee then founded Sybaris on the Traeis a short time after 444 BC. The city was destroyed by the Bruttii not long after their emergence as an ethnic group in 356/355 BC. In the present day the Trionto river flows through the Province of Cosenza in Calabria, Italy. The mouth of the river lies approximately 25 kilometers southeast of the site of Thurii. The exact location of Sybaris on the Traeis has not been found along the course of the Trionto yet. History =Foundation= Diodorus Siculus relates how the Sybarites, whose city had been destroyed by Croton, were assisted by other Greeks in founding Thurii in 446/445 BC. Soon a conflict broke out between the Sybarites and the other colonists over their privileges. According to Diodorus, the Sybarites had assigned the most important offices to themselves, had their wives sacrifice to the gods the first and took the land which lied the closest to the city. Being more numerous and powerful, the other colonists killed many of the Sybarites. Some of them managed to flee and founded Sybaris on the Traeis. John Wonder dates the founding of the city to have taken place shortly after 444 BC. Strabo also mentions Sybaris on the Traeis, stating that some people thought it was of Rhodian origin. Frank Walbank argues that this idea was probably a mistake not endorsed by Strabo himself. =Two alliances= Polybius writes that Sybaris was allied with two other Achaean colonies, Croton and Caulonia. Walbank thinks it very likely that Polybius meant Sybaris on the Traeis. Wonder agrees, noting that the original Sybarites would have been hostile to Croton and would not have formed an alliance with that city. Wonder argues the cities formed this alliance in the second half of the 5th century BC because they felt threatened by neighboring Greek city-states in Southern Italy. In spite of Croton's destruction of the original Sybaris, an alliance would have been mutually beneficial to the former enemies. The establishment of Thurii and its expansionist policy now threatened both cities. Sybaris on the Traeis probably would have been small and not powerful enough to threaten Croton. It could have functioned as a buffer against Thurii for Croton. In turn, the city could benefit from Croton's protection. In the early fourth century BC the situation drastically changed when Dionysius I of Syracuse and the Lucanians threatened the Greek cities of Southern Italy. With the exception of Locri, which was an ally of Dionysius, the cities formed an alliance called the Italiote League in 393 BC. Wonder thinks Sybaris on the Traeis probably was a member of the league together with Croton, Caulonia, Thurii, Rhegium and Velia by 389 BC. =Destruction= Diodorus Siculus writes that Sybaris on the Traeis was eventually destroyed by the Bruttii, but does not give a specific date. Because he dates the formation of the Bruttii as an ethnic group to 356/355 BC the city could not have been destroyed before that date.

The function of GHBP is still unknown. Current research suggests that the protein is associated with regulation of the GH supply in the circulatory system as well as GH receptor function.  Expression  In humans, GHBP is formed by post-translational modification after the complete transcription and translation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene into the cell-surface receptor protein. The gene that codes for GHR (and inherently GHBP) is on Chromosome 5. A precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) from the complete gene first is transcribed and then spliced to encode the full receptor protein. This mature mRNA is composed of exons. Exons are peptide encoding regions of DNA genes that remain in the transcript after splicing and during the maturation of mRNA. The mRNA transcript encodes for a receptor protein that is made up of three distinct parts: an intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain. Specifically, part of exon 2 and exons 3-7 of the GHR gene will translate to amino acids that make up the extracellular domain of GHR. This extracellular domain physically binds GH in the receptor-ligand interaction. \\"Receptor Ectodomain Shedding\\" - Tumor- necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (T.A.C.E.) proteolytically cleaves the extracellular domain off of (two) growth hormone receptor(s) to release the soluble carrier-protein growth hormone-binding protein. Adapted from Fisker. = Receptor ectodomain shedding = When the extracellular domain of GHR is proteolytically cleaved (see: proteolytic cleavage) from the rest of the receptor protein, the extracellular domain is released as the water-soluble, carrier protein GHBP. As the extracellular domain alone, the polypeptide consists of 246 amino acids and is roughly 60 kDA in size. This cleaving process is called ‚Äúreceptor ectodomain shedding. In humans and rabbits, tumor- necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (T.A.C.E.) is postulated to play a significant role in the post-translational processing activity that sheds GHBP from GHR. Studies show that this activity primarily occurs in the liver. When growth hormone is bound to two dimerized GH receptors, the shedding activity is inhibited. This occurs because when the ligand binds to the receptors, a conformational change occurs in them that potentially blocks the proteolytic activity of T.A.C.E. = Alternative splicing = In humans, studies have shown that alternative splicing of the GHR gene can lead to increased rates of proteolysis. For example, a deletion within the mRNA that encodes part of the transmembrane domain of the protein effectively leads to non-translation of the intracellular domain due to the presence of a stop codon. This truncated version of GHR is cleaved more frequently into GHBP and may potentially explain the reasoning behind increased concentrations of GHBP present in some tissues. In mouse and rat models, the extracellular domain is formed primarily through alternative splicing of the precursor GHR mRNA to form a mature transcript that translate GHBP alone. These animals can potentially shed GHBP via post-translational modification as well, although this activity is minimal.  Function  Two growth hormone-binding proteins (blue, pink) in a two-to-one ratio with growth hormone (green). Source: PDB 1HWG The fully characterized, physiological consequences of GHBP binding GH is not known at this time. = Binding stoichiometry = GHBP and GHR bind growth hormone by using the ligand‚Äôs C-terminal disulfide bridges. In GH, two disulfide bridges link four alpha-helices, and these helices make direct contact with the extracellular domain of GHR. Two receptor molecules are pre-dimerized upon GH binding, so it always binds in a 1:2 ratio. Assays estimate that growth hormone and growth hormone binding protein form a natural complex at a 1:1 ratio for transport and preservation of the ligand through the bloodstream. However, some sources have shown that high physiological concentration of GHBP will result in a 1:2 ratio. When the cysteine amino acids in GHBP are mutated and the disulfide bridges are disrupted, the stability of the ligand to bind to the active site of the GHBP is significantly lessened.Junnila RK, Wu Z, Strasburger CJ. The role of human growth hormone's C-terminal disulfide bridge. Growth Horm IGF Res. 2013;23(3):62-7 = Activation = Growth-hormone binding protein (blue) in a one-to-one ratio with modified growth hormone (green). Source: PDB 1HWH The clearance rate, or the rate at which the carrier protein is broken down, for GHBP alone is much faster than when it is bound to its ligand. Additionally, current literature provides evidence that the carrier-protein prolongs the half-life of growth hormone through its binding with the ligand. One purpose of GHBP can be inferred: to maintain the level of GH in the blood, as roughly half of its concentration is complexed with GHBP. Yet this could be confounded by the fact that GH binding to GHBP prevents the ligand from binding to GHR and ultimately proteolytic activity. Another function is that GHBP displays competitive inhibition for GH against the GHR receptor. Studies elucidate another aspect of GHBP physiological role: The proteolytic cleavage activity that forms GHBP ultimately regulates GHR production in humans as well as rats. If there is low GHBP concentration then there are high levels of GHR expression. Conversely, high levels of GHBP protein show negative correlation with levels of growth hormone receptor expression.  Isoforms  = Exon 3 = Studies have identified a GHBP isoform that exists due to gene polymorphism, or variable expression of the allele. These isoforms differ based on whether or not the extracellular domain of GHR includes the amino acids encoded by exon 3 - exon 3 is either kept (dominant) or spliced out (recessive). As human are diploid, they may genotype as homozygous dominant (two copies of the allele retain exon 3), heterozygous (one copy with Exon 3, and one without), or homozygous recessive (two copies of the allele without exon 3). Studies have shown that the two isoforms can co-exist as dimerized GH receptors, as E3+/E3+, E3+/E3-, or E3-/E3-. Furthermore, the two isoforms both exist in the blood as GHBP. However, they may have separate functions that are poorly understood. The presence or absence of exon 3 in humans is individual-specific, but one study suggests that gender may play a role in this variable splicing, as females were shown to express higher levels of deleted-exon 3 GHBP in their blood. The evolutionary reason for exon-3 variable GHBP expression has not clearly be defined, and the isoforms in the blood have not been shown to differ with respect to GH affinity, which is unusual for an isoform that is missing an entire exon.

Depending on the speed of the purchase cycle in the category, tracking can be done continuously (a few interviews every week) or it can be ‚Äúpulsed,‚Äù with interviews conducted in widely spaced waves (ex. every three or six months). Interviews can either be conducted with separate, matched samples of consumers, or with a single (longitudinal) panel that is interviewed over time. Since the researcher has information on when the ads launched, the length of each advertising flight, the money spent, and when the interviews were conducted, the results of ad tracking can provide information on the effects of advertising. Purpose The purpose of ad tracking is generally to provide a measure of the combined effect of the media weight or spending level, the effectiveness of the media buy or targeting, and the quality of the advertising executions or creative. Advertisers use the results of ad tracking to estimate the return on investment (ROI) of advertising, and to refine advertising plans. Sometimes, tracking data are used to provide inputs to Marketing Mix Models which marketing science statisticians build to estimate the role of advertising, as compared to pricing, distribution and other marketplace variables on sales of the brand. Methodology Today, most ad tracking studies are conducted via the Internet. Some ad tracking studies are conducted continuously and others are conducted at specific points in time (typically before the advertising appears in market, and then again after the advertising has been running for some period of time). The two approaches use different types of analyses, although both start by measuring advertising awareness. Typically, the respondent is either shown a brief portion of a commercial or a few memorable still images from the TV ad. Other media typically are cued using either branded or de-branded visual of the ad. Then, respondents answer three significant questions. # Do you recognize this ad? (recognition measure) # Please type in the sponsor of this ad. (unaided awareness measure) # Please choose from the following list, the sponsor of this ad. (aided awareness measure) The continuous tracking design analyzes advertising awareness over time, in relation to ad spending; separately, this design tracks brand awareness, and then develops indices of effectiveness based on the strength of the correlations between ad spending and brand awareness. The most popular alternate approach to the continuous tracking design is the Communicants System longitudinal design, in which the same people are interviewed at two points in time. Changes in brand measures (for example, brand purchasing and future purchase intentions) exhibited among those who have seen the advertising are compared to the changes in brand measures that occurred among those unaware of advertising. By means of this method, the researchers can isolate those marketplace changes that were produced by advertising versus those that would have occurred without advertising. Internet tracking There are several different tools to track online ads: banner ads, ppc ads, pop-up ads, and other types. Several online advertising companies such as Google offer their own ad tracking service (Google Analytics) in order to effectively use their service to generate a positive ROI. Third-party ad tracking services are commonly used by affiliate marketers. Affiliate marketers are frequently unable to have access to the order page and therefore are unable to use a 3rd-party tool. Many different companies have created tools to effectively track their commissions in order to optimize their profit potential. The information provided will show the marketer which advertising methods are generating income and which are not and allows him to effectively allocate his budget.

The famine of 1921-1922 epitomized the adverse effects of War Communism, and to mitigate those effects, Vladimir Lenin instituted the NEP, which encouraged private buying and selling, with people even being encouraged to \\"enrich yourselves\\", as one Bolshevik leader, Nikolai Bukharin, put it. However, many Bolsheviks saw the policy as \\"a step backwards\\". That included Lenin himself, who defended the measure as \\"taking one step backward to take two steps forward later on\\". The biggest group of the 3 million or so NEPmen were engaged in handicrafts in the countryside, but those who traded or ran small businesses in the cities faced the most negative attitudes, especially because some amassed considerable fortunes. One of the main objectives of the Communist Party was to promote socialism, and the capitalist behavior of the NEPmen challenged that goal. However, given the economic benefits that NEPmen provided, the government allowed their existence. As they gained a better standard of living compared to their poor, working class counterparts, NEPmen became reviled, and stereotyped as greedy. Among ordinary folk, traditional hatred of profiteers found focus in the NEPmen, some of it acquiring an anti-Semitic tinge. That was reinforced by the official media representation of NEPmen as vulgar nouveau riches. As Joseph Stalin consolidated his power, he moved aggressively to end the NEP and to put NEPmen out of business, eventually abolishing private commerce in 1931.  Under Lenin  When the NEP was introduced by Lenin in 1921, many NEPmen took advantage of the chance to establish themselves in Soviet society. Lenin's plan was to use the NEP as a temporary measure to rebuild the devastated Soviet economy. The NEPmen‚Äôs role in the new economic climate was to help spread trade to the parts of the country the government could not reach. In fact, in 1922 the NEPmen accounted for almost 75% of the Soviet Union's retail trade. However, not everyone in the country was happy about the NEP and the emergence of NEPmen. Many Bolsheviks saw the NEPmen as competition and feared that they would end up in positions of power, turning the Soviet Union into a capitalist nation. Lenin was highly criticized by his party members for the NEP because it was essentially capitalism controlled by the state. The disapproval of the NEP by many members of society greatly affected a NEPman‚Äôs quality of life. They were closely scrutinized and heavily taxed, and their right to vote was revoked. Socialist advertising was also produced to oppose the NEPmen's capitalistic activities, and this war on capitalism became one of the main goals of Soviet socialist advertising at the time. Lenin combated this slander and disapproval by asserting that the NEP was just a temporary measure required to repair the Soviet‚Äôs crumbling economy. He also pointed out that the NEPmen were helping the economy because they could be heavily taxed, providing more revenue for the state. The increase in revenue would aid the government in securing its plans for a socialist society, while also strengthening the economy. In the eyes of those who supported the policy, NEPmen were nothing more than a stepping stone, providing stability for the creation of the Soviet socialist state in that era. However, by the time of Lenin‚Äôs death in 1924, the NEPmen were being phased out of society to make room for socialist values, and during the Stalin era, NEPman became a dying breed.  Under Stalin  Street Market In 1922, Lenin had his second stroke, which affected his ability to lead. Before his death in 1924, an obvious power struggle between Stalin and Leon Trotsky had begun. Given the instability in Russian leadership, NEPmen gained a small window of opportunity. After a dramatic drop in sales directly from state industry to NEPmen (14.7% to 2.1%) in 1924, the Soviet economy once again relied heavily on NEPmen for stabilization. Decrees in 1925 and 1926 reduced taxes, state loans were no longer mandatory, and employee penalties were alleviated (i.e., lower number of employees, lower taxes). Although NEPmen enjoyed a more hospitable economic and social environment, it did not indicate that they were universally accepted, but rather tolerated. Stalin frequently expressed his disdain for the NEP and NEPmen. It was public knowledge that he was frustrated with members within the Communist Party who supported the policy. Through a series of tactical political moves, Stalin began to solidify his power. By October 1927, Zinoviev and Trotsky, Stalin's main opposition, had been removed from the Central Committee, and could no longer threaten Stalin. As a result, Stalin gained the maneuverability to propose a new economic strategy, and the freedom to develop means of eliminating private entrepreneurship. In 1928, Stalin reignited the attitudes of the October Revolution era, and aggressively propagated anti-NEPmen propaganda. In the same year, the NEP was replaced by Stalin's Five Year Plan, suggesting that NEPmen would also be replaced. However, some scholars argue that a modified version of NEPmen existed into the 1930s. Nonetheless, with Stalin's increasingly unlimited power, tensions escalated, and force became an acceptable means of removing the wealthier class or the \\"enemy of the people\\".

It was a private residence of the Princes of Carignano, after whom it is named. Its rounded fa√ßade is different from other fa√ßades of the same structure. It is located on the Via Accademia delle Scienze. History  The construction of the Palazzo Carignano was ordered by Prince Emmanuel Philibert, son of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano and his French wife Marie de Bourbon. The Prince commissioned architect Guarino Guarini to design a suitable residence for his home and the cadet house of the reigning House of Savoy. Guarini designed the structure in the shape of a square, with a straight and restrained east fa√ßade and an elliptical fa√ßade on the west. Guarini also added a forecourt at the center of the palace. Construction began in 1679, when the Prince was 51 years old. The decorations over the windows of the piano nobile recall the campaign of the Carignano family with Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment against the Iroquois in 1667. The interior has always been described as lavish and has splendid frescoes and stucco decorations. Among the frescoes are some by Stefano Legnani, called il Legnanino. The main stairwell is decorated with busts by Pietro Somazzi. The building, constructed in brick in a typical Baroque style, has an elliptical main fa√ßade. This fa√ßade represents the only example of civic architecture making use of the undulating 'concave ‚Äì convex ‚Äì concave' rhythm established by Francesco Borromini in the church of S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. The Palazzo was the birthplace of Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe in 1749 ‚Äì confidant of Marie Antoinette and for whom she died in 1792. Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano was born there in 1770. It was also the birthplace of the first King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II in 1820. From 1848 to 1861 the palace was used as the House of Deputies of the Subalpine Parliament. In 1861, with the creation of the parliament of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy, the room was not large enough to host the House of Deputies, which was moved elsewhere.

She was martyred by the servants of her angry husband because she preferred to become a nun rather than marry. Hagiography Tradition, as recorded in her Vita, states that she was pious as a young girl, and became much sought after by suitors as a beautiful young woman. Godelieve, however, wanted to become a nun. A nobleman named Bertolf (Berthold) of Gistel, however, determined to marry her, successfully invoked the help of her father's overlord, Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. Berthold's servants were ordered to provide only bread and water to the young bride. Godelieve shared this food with the poor. Godelieve managed to escape to the home of her father, Hemfrid, seigneur of Wierre-Effroy. Hemfrid, appealing to the Bishops of Tournai and Soissons and the Count of Flanders, managed to have Bertolf restore Godelieve to her rightful position as his wife. In July 1070, Godelieve returned to Gistel and soon after, at the order of Bertolf, was strangled by two servants and thrown into a pool, to make it appear as if she had died a natural death. Legend According to legend, Bertolf married again, and had a daughter Edith, who was born blind: the legend states that Edith was cured through the intercession of Saint Godelieve. Bertolf, now repentant of his crimes, went to Rome to obtain absolution. He went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and became a monk at St. Winnoc's Abbey at Bergues. Edith founded a Benedictine monastery at Gistel, which was dedicated to Saint Godelieve, which she joined herself as a nun. Veneration Godelieve's body was exhumed in 1084 by the Bishops of Tournai and Noyon, in the presence of Gertrude of Saxony, the wife of Robert I, Count of Flanders, the Abbot of St. Winnoc's and a number of clergymen. It was Radbod II, bishop of Noyon-Tournai, that consecrated Godelieve's relics in 1084, and Godelieve's popular cult developed thereafter. Drogo, a monk of St. Winnoc's Abbey, wrote Godelieve's biography, the Vita Godeliph, about ten years after her death. The abbey of Ten Putte Abbey in Bruges was dedicated to her, and the name of the first Abbess was Agatha. Every year, on the Sunday following 5 July, a procession celebrating Saint Godelieve takes place in Gistel. Godelieve's feast day, 6 July, was, like that of Saint Swithun in England and Saint Medard in France, connected with the weather. She is thus considered one of the \\"weather saints\\". The Godelieve Polyptych Godelieve's life is represented in the Godelieve Polyptych, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.The Life and Miracles of Saint Godelieve Image:JanProvostDonorwithStNicholas andwifewithStGodelina.JPGDonor with Saint Nicholas and Wife with Saint Godelina by Jan Provoost.

Function  PIT1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor responsible for pituitary development and hormone expression in mammals and is a member of the POU family of transcription factors that regulate mammalian development. The POU family is so named because the first 3 members identified were PIT1 and OCT1 (MIM 164175) of mammals, and Unc-86 of C. elegans (Herr et al., 1988).

Early life and career He was the eldest of five children born to Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Horatio Kitchener (1805‚Äì1894) and his first wife Anne Frances Chevallier (1826‚Äì1864). Among his siblings was the military commander Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. He spent his early life in Tralee in Ireland, where he and his siblings received their education from governesses and tutors. Kitchener joined the British Army in 1866 and was commissioned into the 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, before joining the newly created Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry when it was founded in 1881. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, he served alongside his brother in France. He served as garrison instructor at the Curragh Camp in Ireland from July 1876 until July 1878 and was appointed the instructor in military topography at the Royal Military College in 1879, a post he held until August 1886. He saw his first action in Burma with the British Army, where he was chief transport officer of the Field Force's during the Manipur Expedition in 1891. He was posted to Jamaica in December 1898, where he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant general for the British colony before receiving his final posting in the army when he was appointed commander of the Depot for the West India Regiment. He retired from the army in 1903 with the rank of colonel. Post-retirement After retiring he remained in Jamaica where he was a property owner. He became involved in local politics and contested the St Andrew Parish in the legislative council elections but was not elected. With the outbreak of the First World War, he was recalled to the army and was posted to take up a command post in South West Africa; he was also put in command of a British Expeditionary Force sent to fight the Germans in East Africa. In accordance with a special remainder in the letters patent, he succeeded his younger brother as second Earl Kitchener on 5 June 1916. He left Jamaica to return to Britain in 1918. After the war he moved to Kenya where he was active in encouraging the settlement of war veterans in the British colony; he also developed a number of flax-producing estates there.

Cotswold was originally a separate community, but was amalgamated with other communities to create the Town of Minto.  History  The name Cotswold is English, associated with a range of hills in the Midlands renowned for sheep grazing. The name does not reflect the backgrounds of the early settlers in the district, most of whom where Scottish and Irish; legend says that a settler imported sheep from Cotswold hills and borrowed the name for the post office. The early settlement did have several stores, including a blacksmith shop, cobbler, cheese Factory, gristmill, log schoolhouse, and sawmill, one of which also functioned as the post office.. The Cotswold Cheese factory (Minto and Arthur Cheese and Butter Manufacturing Company Limited) opened in 1881 and was successful in its 30 years of business, but was still only a marginal operation. Records show a change in ownership of various businesses (possibly due to low profits). The community declined as the roads to Palmerston and Harriston improved. The post office was the last holdout; it closed in 1914. After 50 years of settlement, most of Cotswold's pioneers were gone.

They include remnants of the Yeltsin family, Saint Petersburg lawyers and economists, and security-intelligence elements called the siloviki.  Background  When Putin came to power, he had few prot√©g√©s or long-term associates, and had to balance various competitive elements as he crafted his team. In contrast to the Yeltsin years, Putin's regime was marked by personnel stability, a gradual elevation of trusted associates and coalition-building across competing interests both within the presidential administration and with other political actors.  Overview  As President Vladimir Putin, former employee of the Leningrad and Leningrad Oblast KGB Directorate and former Chief of the Committee for External Relations of Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office, had come to the presidency in 2000, many political observers noticed quick career promotion of bureaucracy and businesspeople from Saint Petersburg to the federal power bodies (especially the Presidential Executive Office, a very influential institution that has always been totally controlled by the presidential authority) and large state-controlled companies (such as Gazprom and Rosneft) and their struggle against old Moscow elites loyal to Boris Yeltsin's family, known as Family group, as well as against influential media tycoon Boris Berezovsky and his allies, who helped Putin on his way to power in 1999‚Äì2000.–ü—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø—É—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–ª–∏–≥–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–∏ (Origins of Putin's oligarchy) by Vladimir Pribylovsky (2005).Back in business - how Putin's allies are turning Russia into a corporate state by Neil Buckley and Arkady Ostrovsky, The Financial Times, June 19, 2006.Meet the chief exec of Kremlin inc ... by Nick Paton Walsh, The Guardian, July 6, 2005.St. Petersburg Team Building Their Own ‚ÄôFamily‚Äô by Dmitry Koptev, The Moscow News, July 28, 2004,As Russian's Trial Ends, So Does Era Of First Oligarchs by Peter Finn, The Washington Post, April 27, 2005. According to Associate Professor of Political Science John P. Willerton, it is difficult to make general judgements about the various informal groups, their backgrounds and political preferences.  Major groups  Major informal groups of the second-term Putin presidency = St. Petersburg economists and lawyers = According to Associate Professor of Political Science John P. Willerton of the University of Arizona in the United States, reformist St. Petersburg economists and lawyers constitute a prominent group in the Putin team. Many of them have career and personal ties to Putin dating back to the early 1990s. Many of the members of the economic reform team, both in the presidential administration and the government, are drawn from the St Petersburg group. They are academically qualified and have significant administrative experience, are often focused on the technical complexities of the country's system transformation. They are - in general - committed to market development, privatization and the continued diminution of the state's role in the country's socioeconomic life. The liberal economists contend that the consolidation of democracy comes with improving the population's standard of living and developing the private sector. Prominent St Petersburg economists include Alexei Kudrin, Herman Gref and Putin's economic adviser Andrey Illarionov. Putin with Sergei Ivanov, Dmitry Medvedev, Dmitry Kozak, Valentina Matviyenko, Sergey Naryshkin, and Sergey Shoygu at the funeral of Yevgeny Primakov, 29 June 2015 The St Petersburg lawyers focus on constitutional- legal-administrative arrangements to bolster and efficient democratic system, favouring reforms that strengthen simultaneously the market economy and political stability. Prominent members included the former presidential administration head Dmitry Medvedev and Dmitry Kozak. = Siloviki = Much foreign attention has been given to the security-intelligence elements, what Russians refer to as the siloviki. They began coming to power under Yeltsin, but this accelerated during Putin's premiership and presidency. A common view in Russia is that these siloviki are generally non-ideological, are corrupt, have a pragmatic law and order focus and have Russian national interests at heart. They do not form a cohesive group. It is worth noting that Putin himself is a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the KGB. = Remnants of the Yeltsin family = Another identifiable group are the remnants of the so- called \\"Family\\" - a term which originally referred to relatives and associates of the former president Yeltsin. Most senior members of the group have left the highest corridors of power, but some have been able to survive and secure influential positions. = Ozero = Ozero is the name of a co-operative society headed, inter alia, by Putin. The co-operative administers Putin's substantial personal wealth generated over the course of his presidency. The immense financial power of members of the co-operative fundamentally creates a wealthy clique of new oligarchs capable of replacing the financial power of Yeltsin era oligarchs.  Outside opinion  According to a The Washington Quarterly article written by Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap in 2006-2007, at the start of his presidency, Vladimir Putin announced that he would consolidate political powers in Russia into the so-called power vertical. However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within the president's inner circle. Although other institutions now became largely irrelevant, disputes and clashes between Kremlin factions, rather than the president's will, are getting more and more important in determining major policy outcomes, Bremmer and Charap write.*The Siloviki in Putin‚Äôs Russia: Who They Are and What They Want by Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap, The Washington Quarterly 30.1 (2006-2007).  History  During the final years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, Alexander Voloshin, chief of the Presidential Executive Office, was considered to be the most influential figure within the Family group. Despite his obvious connections to Russian commerce, he was dominating Russia's politics of that time. In 1999 the Family group, Vladimir Putin, Boris Berezovsky and their allies united their efforts in order to prevent coming to power of the Fatherland-All Russia political alliance of former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov that was supported by media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky and to some extent by the public opinion. The efforts were successful, but as soon as Putin had won the 2000 presidential election, an acute conflict with Boris Berezovsky developed, and in 2002 Berezovsky fled to London. As a result, Russian authorities consolidated their power over Russian TV companies NTV and ORT previously controlled by Vladimir Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky, respectively. The Family group has also almost entirely lost its influence by 2004 after the dismissals of Alexander Voloshin (October 2003), Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov (February 2004) and some key figures of his Cabinet, but some of the group's members secured their political survival. Vladislav Surkov, initially being an aide to Voloshin, gained much influence, as well as Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, who had leaned towards new Saint Petersburg elites and whose son had become Igor Sechin's son-in-law. Tycoon Roman Abramovich, who had leaned towards the Family group in the 1990s, also remained influential, as well as former Mass Media Minister Mikhail Lesin. Each of them, however, had already distanced away from the Family group by that time. As the Family group had lost its influence, especially during Vladimir Putin's second four-year presidential term (since May 7, 2004), some conflicts between parts of the new elites of Saint Petersburg origin became evident, as witnessed e.g. by the disputes over the fate of YUKOS, failed project of merging Rosneft and Gazprom, struggle for Sibneft and upcoming 2008 presidential election, some appointments and dismissals in Mikhail Fradkov's Second Cabinet and consequences of the Three Whales Corruption Scandal, but the exact configuration of these new groups still remains unclear. However, it is widely acknowledged that Igor Sechin and Dmitry Medvedev are key figures heading their own factions and opposed to each other but both very close to Putin. Former Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov is considered a close ally of Sechin.

It was determined he had died three days earlier, on April 5. The Seattle Police Department incident report states that Cobain \\"was found with a shotgun across his body, had a visible head wound and there was a suicide note discovered nearby\\". Conspiracy theories that Cobain was murdered began shortly after the incident and have persisted into the present day.  Background  Kurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the American rock band Nirvana, one of the most influential acts of the 1990s and one of the best- selling bands of all time.\\"Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl\\". CBC.ca. March 21, 2009. Retrieved March 7, 2012. Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition. He was also prone to alcoholism and regularly used drugs and inhalants. According to The Telegraph, Cobain had depression. Two uncles of his cousin had killed themselves using guns. On March 3, 1994, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome following an overdose of painkillers. His management agency, Gold Mountain Records, said that the overdose was accidental, and that he was suffering from influenza and fatigue.Harper, Marla. \\"NAMES & FACES.\\" The Washington Post. N.p., March 5, 1994. Web. February 20, 2015. . However, Cobain's wife Courtney Love later said the overdose had been a suicide attempt: \\"He took 50 pills. He probably forgot how many he took. But there was a definite suicidal urge, to be gobbling and gobbling and gobbling.\\" Now in Commentators have cited Cobain's persistent drug addiction, clinical depression, and handwritten suicide note as proof of his poor mental state. Members of Cobain's family had noticed patterns of depression and instability in Cobain before he achieved fame. Cobain mentioned that the stomach pains were so severe during Nirvana's 1991 European tour that he became suicidal and stated that taking heroin was \\"[his] choice\\"; saying, \\"This [heroin] is the only thing that's saving me from shooting myself right now.\\"Azerrad, p. 236 Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, stated that the singer's family had a history of suicide, and that Cobain's bipolar disorder and his struggles with drug addiction led him to suicide. In Charles Cross's biography Heavier Than Heaven, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic is quoted on seeing Cobain in the days before his intervention: \\"He was really quiet. He was just estranged from all of his relationships. He wasn't connecting with anybody.\\" Novoselic's offer to buy a dinner for Cobain resulted in unintentionally driving him to score heroin: \\"His dealer was right there. He wanted to get fucked up into oblivion ... He wanted to die, that's what he wanted to do.\\"  Death  On March 31, 1994, Cobain left the rehabilitation center he had checked into the day before, Exodus Recovery Center, by scaling a six-foot brick wall. On April 2, 1994, a taxi driver drove Cobain to a Seattle gun shop, where Cobain received a receipt for firearm shells. Cobain told the driver he wanted to buy shells because he had been burglarized. closing, \\"[I]t's better to burn out than to fade away,\\" is a quote from Neil Young's \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\". On April 8, 1994, a body was discovered in the greenhouse above the garage at Cobain's Lake Washington Boulevard East house by VECA Electric employee Gary T. Smith, who arrived that morning to install security lighting. Smith thought he was asleep until he saw blood oozing from Cobain's ear. He also found a suicide note with a pen stuck through it inside a flower pot. A Remington Model 11 20-gauge shotgun purchased for Cobain by his friend musician Dylan Carlson was found on Cobain's chest. It had been legally purchased by Carlson at Stan Baker's Gun Shop in Seattle. Cobain did not want the gun purchased in his name because he thought the police might seize it for his own protection. The police had taken away his guns twice in the previous 10 months. The King County Medical Examiner noted puncture wounds on the inside of both the right and left elbows. The shotgun, a 20-gauge Remington Model 11, was not checked for fingerprints until May 6, 1994. According to the Fingerprint Analysis Report, four latent prints were lifted, but they were not usable. The Seattle police report states that the shotgun was inverted on Cobain's chest with his left hand wrapped around the barrel. On April 14, 1994, the Seattle Post- Intelligencer reported that Cobain was \\"high on heroin when he pulled the trigger\\". The paper reported that the toxicological tests determined that the level of morphine in Cobain's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter and that there was also evidence of valium in his blood. The report contained a quote from Dr. Randall Baselt of the Chemical Toxicological Institute, stating that Cobain's heroin level was at \\"a high concentration, by any account\\". He also stated that the strength of that dose would depend on many factors, including how habituated Cobain was to the drug. In March 2014, the Seattle Police Department developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault. According to the Seattle police, the photographs depict the scene of Cobain's corpse more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a cold case investigator, was asked to look at the film because \\"it is 20 years later and it's a high media case\\". Ciesynski stated that the official cause of Cobain's death remains suicide and that the images would not be released to the public, but in 2016, the images were released. According to a spokesperson for the Seattle police, the department receives at least one request weekly, mostly through Twitter, to reopen the investigation. This resulted in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.  Memorial and cremation  On April 10, 1994, a public memorial service was held at Seattle Center, where a recording of Courtney Love reading Cobain's suicide note was played. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived, and distributed some of his clothing to fans who remained.Azerrad, Michael (2001). Come As You Are: the Story of Nirvana. Broadway Books/Random House: New York. p. 350 In the following days, Love consoled and mourned with fans who came to her house. Cobain's body was cremated. Love divided his ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. She took another portion of his ashes to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York. There, some of his remains were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay, which were used to make memorial sculptures. A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain by his mother on May 31, 1999, that was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. A Buddhist monk chanted while his daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, scattered his ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington, the city where he \\"had found his true artistic muse\\".  Reactions from Cobain's friends  Several of Cobain's friends were surprised when he committed suicide. Mark Lanegan, a long-time friend of Cobain, told Rolling Stone: \\"I never knew [Cobain] to be suicidal. I just knew he was going through a tough time.\\" In the same article, Carlson stated that he wished Cobain or someone close to him had told him that Rome was a suicide attempt. Danny Goldberg, husband of Carroll and founder of Gold Mountain Records, refers in his book Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit to \\"the crazy Internet rumors that Kurt Cobain had not committed suicide but had been murdered,\\" stating that Cobain's suicide \\"haunts [him] every day\\".Goldberg, Danny. Dispatches From the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit. Miramax, 2003. Anthony Kiedis, lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, expressed his feelings in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, writing: > The news [of Cobain's death] sucked the air out of the entire house, I > didn't feel like I felt when Hillel died; it was more like \\"The world just > suffered a great loss.\\" Kurt's death was unexpected ... It was an emotional > blow, and we all felt it.

The song \\"Tearjerker\\" from the band's One Hot Minute album was written about Cobain. A musical hero of Cobain's, Greg Sage, said in an interview: > Well, I can't really speculate other than what he said to me, which was, he > wasn't at all happy about it, success to him seemed like, I think, a brick > wall.

Murder conspiracy theories  The official ruling of suicide has been disputed by people familiar with the death. = Richard Lee = The first to object publicly to the report of suicide was Seattle public access host Richard Lee. A week following Cobain's death, Lee aired the first episode of an ongoing series called Kurt Cobain Was Murdered, claiming there were several discrepancies in the police reports, including several changes in the nature of the shotgun blast. Lee acquired a video that was taped on April 8 from the tree outside Cobain's garage, showing the scene around Cobain's body, which he claimed showed a marked absence of blood for what was reported as a point- blank shotgun blast to the head. Several pathology experts have stated that a shotgun blast inside the mouth often results in less blood, unlike a shotgun blast to the head. = Tom Grant = Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after his departure from drug rehabilitation, said he believes that Cobain was murdered. Grant's theory has been analyzed and questioned by several books, television shows, films, and the 2015 docudrama Soaked in Bleach. Grant was still under Love's employment when the body was found. Grant has stated that the events surrounding the death of Cobain are \\"filled with lies, contradictions in logic, and countless inconsistencies. Motivated by profit over truth as well as a web of business deals and personal career considerations, Courtney Love, her lawyers, and many of Courtney's industry supporters have engaged in an effort to keep the public from learning the real facts of this case.\\" There are several components to Grant's theory. Grant argues that Cobain could not have injected himself with such a dose and still have been able to pull the trigger. Grant does not believe that Cobain was killed by the heroin dose. He suggests that the heroin was used to incapacitate Cobain before the final shotgun blast was administered by the perpetrator. Grant, Wallace, and Halperin have used the dosage reported in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, not the actual autopsy report, and may not have the correct figure. The Seattle police cannot release the information to the media because reports and records of autopsies are confidential and protected under state and federal law. While working for Love, Grant was given access to Cobain's suicide note and used her fax machine to make a photocopy, which has since been widely distributed. After studying the notes, Grant believed that it was actually a letter written by Cobain announcing his intent to leave Love, Seattle, and the music business. Grant asserts that the lines at the very bottom of the note, separate from the rest, are the only parts implying suicide. While the official report on Cobain's death concluded that Cobain wrote the note, Grant claims that the official report does not distinguish these final lines from the rest of the note and assumes it was entirely written by Cobain. Despite consulting with many handwriting experts, some disagree with Grant's claims. Document examiner Janis Parker concluded that the note was written by Cobain after spending two weeks examining the original copy. When Dateline NBC sent a copy of the note to four different handwriting experts, one concluded that the entire note was in Cobain's hand, while the other three said the sample was inconclusive.Lauer, Matt. \\"More questions in Kurt Cobain death?\\" Dateline NBC. April 5, 2004. One expert contacted by the television series Unsolved Mysteries expressed the difficulty in drawing a conclusion, given that the note being studied was a photocopy rather than the original. But in the same documentary, two other experts found the writing, especially the last four lines, suspicious. Grant also cites circumstantial evidence from the official report. For example, the report claimed that the doors of the greenhouse could not have been locked from the outside, meaning that Cobain would have had to lock them himself. Grant said that when he saw the doors for himself, he found that they could be locked and pulled shut. He also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to key evidence, including the shotgun. Grant notes that the official report said that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note as well as the pen that had been shoved through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on. None of the circumstantial evidence directly points to murder, but Grant has said he believes it supports the larger case. In studying the Rome incident, journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace contacted Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, who treated Cobain after the incident. Galletta contested the claim that the Rome overdose was a suicide attempt, telling Halperin and Wallace, \\"We can usually tell a suicide attempt. This didn't look like one to me.\\" Galletta also specifically denied Love's claim that 50 Rohypnol pills were removed from Cobain's stomach. However, they also stated, \\"Grant believes Courtney may have mixed a large number of pills into Kurt's champagne so that when he took a drink, he was actually unknowingly ingesting large amounts of the drug, enough to kill him. But if that's the case, why did she call the police when she found him unconscious on the floor? If she wanted Kurt dead, why didn't she just leave him on the floor until he died?\\" Grant believes that the claim of the Rome incident being a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's death. He claims that people close to Cobain, including Gold Mountain Records, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's death. Grant believes that if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told so that they could have watched over him. Others have asserted that the claims by Gold Mountain and others were simply efforts to mask what was happening behind the scenes. Lee Ranaldo, guitarist for Sonic Youth, told Rolling Stone, \\"Rome was only the latest installment of [those around Cobain] keeping a semblance of normalcy for the outside world.\\"Strauss, Neil. \\"The Downward Spiral\\". Cobain: By the Editors of Rolling Stone. 1994. Grant spoke to Love's attorney, Rosemary Carroll, at her office on April 13, 1994. He said she pressed him to investigate Cobain's death, and that Cobain was not suicidal. Carroll also claims that Cobain had asked her to draw up a will excluding Love because he was planning to file for divorce. Grant said this was the motive for Cobain's death, thus alleging he had been murdered by Love. Carroll also provided Grant with a handwriting practice note that she found in Love's backpack that was left at her home. It has been suggested that the handwriting on this practice note is markedly similar to the handwriting found on the last four lines of Cobain's suicide note. Grant has contended that another motive for Love wanting Cobain dead was him turning down nearly $10 million to headline the 1994 Lollapalooza festival. Grant counters the claim that he profits from the sale of casebook kits on his website by stating that it offsets some of the costs of his investigation. Grant stated: \\"I wrestled with that ... but if I go broke, I'll have to give up my pursuit and Courtney wins.\\"Halperin & Wallace, p. 126 Sergeant Donald Cameron, one of the homicide detectives involved in the case, specifically dismissed Grant's theory, claiming, \\"[Grant] hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide.\\" Grant in turn has accused Cameron of being a personal friend of Love's. Dylan Carlson told Halperin and Wallace that he also did not believe that the theory was legitimate, and in an interview with Broomfield implied that if he believed that his friend was murdered, he would have dealt with it himself. In Kurt & Courtney, he specifically states that he would kill Love and any others involved if he believed that they had murdered Cobain. = Nick Broomfield = Filmmaker Nick Broomfield, deciding to investigate the theories himself, brought a film crew to visit a number of people associated with both Cobain and Love, including Love's estranged father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couples' former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to The Mentors' bandleader Eldon \\"El Duce\\" Hoke, who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed that he knew who killed Cobain, he did not mention a name and offered no evidence to support his assertion. However, he mentioned speaking to someone called \\"Allen\\" (of the band Kill Allen Wrench), before quickly interjecting, \\"I mean, my friend\\", then laughing, \\"I'll let the FBI catch him.\\" According to Mentors' bass player Steve Broy, the whole story was concocted to sell supermarket tabloids. Broomfield incidentally captured Hoke's final interview, as he died days later when he was struck by a train in the middle of the night. Broomfield titled the finished documentary Kurt & Courtney, which was released on February 27, 1998. In the end, Broomfield felt he hadn't uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, he summed up his thoughts: \\"I think that he committed suicide. I don't think that there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.\\" = Ian Halperin and Max Wallace = Journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace followed a similar path and attempted to investigate the murder theory themselves. Based on evidence gathered in interviews, Halperin and Wallace believed that Cobain wanted to divorce Love near the time of his death, and that she was looking for \\"a vicious divorce lawyer\\" to help crush a prenuptial agreement she'd reportedly signed that would keep their respective fortunes separate in the event of divorce. They also made the case that because Nikolas Hartshorne (the coroner in Cobain's case) was an admitted friend of Love's, that this was a conflict of interest. Their initial book, Who Killed Kurt Cobain?, was released in 1999, and drew a similar conclusion to Broomfield's film: while there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively prove foul play, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened. A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation he had undertaken while he was working for Love. Halperin and Wallace insisted that Grant play the tapes of his conversations with Carroll so that they could confirm his story. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain. = Friends and family = Several of Cobain's friends and even members of his own family also believe Cobain was murdered. Hank Harrison, Courtney Love's father, has shared his belief that Love had a motive, there is evidence of foul play, and the case should be re-opened. Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain, also publicly stated that he believed Cobain was murdered.Gold, Todd. \\"Remembering Kurt\\" People Magazine, April 12, 2004. Retrieved October 17, 2008.

The species is found in a small area of western central Africa. Black colobuses are large, completely covered with black fur, and like all other Colobus monkeys, do not have a thumb. The species has faced large declines in population due to habitat destruction and hunting by humans, and was consequently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1994. Taxonomy The black colobus monkey is one of five recognised species in the genus Colobus. The black colobus is the oldest species in this genera and is thought to have diverged 3-4 million years ago. There are two subspecies of black colobus monkey: *Colobus satanas satanas ‚Äì Bioko black colobus (Waterhouse, 1838) *Colobus satanas anthracinus ‚Äì Gabon black colobus (Le Conte, 1857) Etymology The word 'Colobus' comes from the Greek word for 'mutilated', as all Colobus monkeys only have a short stump where the thumb would be. The word 'satanas' means 'the accuser' or 'the devil' in Greek. Description Colobus satanas skull The black colobus monkey is a large species with a head-body length of 50‚Äì70 cm and a long tail of around 80 cm. As in all Colobus species, the black colobus has a slender build and ischial callosities - tough pads of skin on the rump. There is little sexual dimorphism between the two sexes - adult males can weigh between 10‚Äì15 kg, whilst females weigh between 10‚Äì11 kg. The black colobus is covered in black fur apart from the ears and face, and has longer hairs on its cheeks and forehead. Unlike other species of colobus monkey, black colobuses have no white markings. The two subspecies of black colobus look very similar, although the fur of Colobus s. satanas is slightly longer and fluffier. There is currently not enough data to estimate the life expectancy of the species. Distribution and habitat The black colobus monkey is found in Equatorial Guinea, south west Cameroon and central and north-western Gabon. Small populations may also occur in the north of the Republic of the Congo. The subspecies C.s.satanas is only found on Bioko Island, off the coast of Cameroon. The distribution of the black colobus has decreased dramatically - the species is now rare or absent in some areas of its range due to its habitat being destroyed for logging. Black colobuses are known to live at low densities, but there is currently no total population estimate for the species. One of the largest remaining populations of the species, consisting of 50,000-55,900 individuals, is found in Lope Reserve, Gabon. Other remaining large populations are found in the Foret des Abeilles in central Gabon and Douala-Edea Reserve in Cameroon. The black colobus is an arboreal species that lives high in the canopy of dense rainforest and occasionally coastal sand dune or wooded meadows. Black colobuses are unable to survive in secondary forest that has regrown after a major disturbance such as logging and therefore tend to avoid areas populated by humans. The black colobus cannot be bred in captivity due to the food and habitat it requires. Behaviour =Diet= Black colobus monkeys are herbivores and feed predominantly on seeds. Their robust, flat teeth allow them to chew tough seeds easily. This diet means that the species plays an important role as seed dispersers in the ecosystem. Black colobuses also eat large amounts of leaves, in particular lianas, as well as flowers, buds and unripe fruits. Unlike most primates, Colobus monkeys have multi-chambered ruminant stomachs which allow them to easily digest these leaves. Younger leaves and seeds are preferred, as these are rich in nutrients and contain lower amounts of digestion-inhibiting compounds such as tannin. However, the black colobus monkey can withstand high levels of these poisonous compounds and can therefore eat food that is undigestable to other colobus monkeys. This means they can live in areas unoccupied by other species. Black colobus monkeys have also been observed eating soil, which may be to ensure that they have enough minerals such as sodium in their diet. =Social structure= Black colobus monkeys live in multi-male groups of 10-20 individuals. The species is territorial and will make loud calls to warn other groups away from the area in which they are feeding. The black colobus call is distinctive from other primate species and sounds like a loud 'sneeze' followed by a roaring noise. Black colobus groups are sometimes joined by single male crested mona monkeys (Cercopithecus pogonias). These individuals take part in black colobus grooming and socialising and are thought integrate themselves into black colobus groups for protection. Colobus monkeys have been known to respond to crested mona monkey alarm calls. =Activity= Black colobus monkeys are diurnal and spend around 60% of their time resting. The remaining part of their day is spent feeding, socialising and moving. Black colobuses have large home ranges and will move up to 850 metres each day in search of food. =Reproduction= Black colobus monkeys do not have a specific breeding season, but most mating occurs during rainy times of the year. Males reach sexual maturity at age 6, in females this occurs at age 4. Females do not have a sexual swelling as seen in other primate species and give birth to a single baby after a gestation period of around 195 days. Females have a baby every 20 months on average. Black colobus babies are born with brown fur and become black, unlike all other Colobus species, which are born with white fur. Allomothering, when other members of the group help mothers to care for their babies, is relatively rare in the black colobus monkey. Black colobus babies are carried around by the mother and spend time playing with other members of the group as they grow in order to learn and socialise. Conservation The black colobus monkey is one of the most threatened primate species in Africa and is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. This is because the species‚Äô population has declined by over 30% in the past 30 years. The subspecies C.s.satanas is classified as Endangered as its population has declined by over 60% in the last 30 years. The black colobus monkey is now only found in areas which cannot be easily accessed by humans. The species has faced population declines due to logging and illegal hunting for the fur trade which began in the 19th century. Due to improved roads and increased wealth in the area, commercial hunting for the species has become more profitable. Today, black colobus monkeys are mainly traded for their meat and account for 20% of the bushmeat sold in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea. One adult black colobus carcass is sold for around US$20.42. The black colobus monkey is listed under Appendix II of CITES, which restricts international trade of the species. The species is also listed under Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Further information and data is needed to in order to help conserve the species. Conservation programs such as the Bioko Biodiversity Protection Program aim to work with local people to learn more about the black colobus monkey and protect it from extinction.

It was the first Linux distribution created for computer users who were not Unix expertsMoody, Glyn (2002) Rebel Code and featured a menu- driven installer that installed both the kernel and a set of end-user and programming tools. The MCC first made Linux available by anonymous FTP in November 1991. Le Blanc's irritations with his early experiments with Linux, such as the lack of a working fdisk (he would later write one), the need to use multiple FTP repositories to acquire all the essential software, and library version problems, inspired the creation of this distribution. Le Blanc claimed he referred to the distributions as \\"interim\\" because \\"...they are not intended to be final or official. They are small, harmonious, and moderately tested. They do not conform to everyone's taste -- what release does? -- but they should provide a stable base to which other software can be added.\\" History Prior to its first release, the closest approximation to a Linux distribution had been H J Lu's \\"Boot/Root\\" floppy disk images from early 1992.https://www.maketecheasier.com/history-of-early-linux-distros/ These were two 5¬º\\" diskette images containing the Linux kernel and the minimum tools required to get started. So minimal were these tools that to be able to boot from a hard drive required editing its master boot record with a hex editor.A Short History of Linux Distributions by Joe Klemmer [LWN.net] The first release of MCC Interim Linux was based on Linux 0.12 and made use of Theodore Ts'o's ramdisk code to copy a small root image to memory, freeing the floppy drive for additional utilities diskettes. He also stated his distributions were \\"unofficial experiments\\", describing the goals of his releases as being: *To provide a simple installation procedure. *To provide a more complete installation procedure. *To provide a backup/recovery service. *To back up his (then) current system. *To compile, link, and test every binary file under the current versions of the kernel, gcc, and libraries. *To provide a stable base system, which can be installed in a short time, and to which other software can be added with relatively little effort. Indeed, no attempt was ever made to distribute it with a wide range of software or even the X386 windowing system. Successors Soon after the first release came other distributions such as TAMU, created by individuals at Texas A&M; University, Martin Junius's MJ, Softlanding Linux System and H J Lu's small base system. These in turn were quickly superseded by Debian, Red Hat Linux and Slackware, the oldest surviving distributions. The 1.0 distribution of MCC Interim pointed out that Debian was \\"five times the size of MCC, and quite comprehensive\\", and the final distribution encouraged users to switch to Debian by providing transitional support.http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc- interim/2.0+/debian/Debian.README Included software =Version 0.95c+= As discussed in an email dated 23 April 1992, the boot and utilities disk pair included: *bash *compress *elvis *gawk *The GNU shell/file/text utilities *grep/egrep/fgrep *joe *less *make *more *mtools *sed *tar *uuencode/uudecode An optional pair of disks contained gcc and g++ 2.1, kermit and shoelace. =Version 0.99.p8= Released on 14 April 1993.http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non- debian/mcc-interim/old/0.99p8/Changelog Added to version 0.95c+ were bison, flex, gdb, gprof, groff, gziphttp://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc- interim/old/0.99p8/Acknowledgements and man.http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non- debian/mcc-interim/old/0.99p8/README.package =Version 0.99.p8+= Released on 26 April 1993.http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc- interim/old/0.99.p8+/Changelog Added to version 0.99.p8 were emacs and info.http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc-interim/old/0.99.p8+/README.ftp =Version 1.0+= Added to version 0.99.p8+ were elm,http://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc- interim/old/1.0+/documentation/Origins lp, mail, progman, timezone and wordshttp://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc- interim/old/1.0+/documentation/README.ftp References External links *MCC's site featuring versions 0.97-p2-12 to 2.0+ *MCC Interim Linux at ibiblio Discontinued Linux distributions Science and technology in Greater Manchester University of Manchester ","title":"MCC Interim Linux"},{"id":"9678519","text":"Kenny Kingston (February 15, 1927 ‚Äì June 30, 2014) was an American psychic.

It flows northwestward and empties to Bombetoka Bay, forming a large delta. It originates to the east of Antananarivo. The river is surrounded in mangroves. The river is distinctive for its red-coloured water, which is caused by river sediments. The river carries an enormous amount of reddish-orange silt to the sea. Much of this silt is deposited at the mouth of the river or in the bay. It is dramatic evidence of the catastrophic erosion of northwestern Madagascar. Removal of the native forest for cultivation and pastureland during the past 50 years has led to massive annual soil losses approaching 250 metric tonnes per hectare (112 tons per acre) in some regions of the island, the largest amount recorded anywhere in the world. Several fish species are endemic to the river basin, including the three cichlids Paretroplus petiti, P. tsimoly and P. maculatus. The Betsiboka's largest tributary, the Ikopa River, drains the capital city of Antananarivo.

It was the first production boat featuring a retractable bowsprit, which allows for an unusually large asymmetric spinnaker. It was introduced in 1991 by J/Boats and designed by Rod Johnstone. J/105s are a common sight in one design racing and to date, Jboats has built 685 J/105s. The J/105 is regarded as a fast design with a clean deck layout. It was selected as the 1992 \\"Boat of the Year\\" in the Racer/Cruiser category by Sailing World Magazine. The concept behind the J/105 line is to produce boats that are fast, strong, fun and easy to sail shorthanded while racing in One Design fleets or while cruising with dodger raised, sails furled and swim ladder swung off the transom. J/105 has the stability, rig and sail controls to handle 15-20 knot winds without the need of reefing. It has the strength and seaworthiness for oceangoing passages. The J/105 is the most successful one-design keelboat class over 30' in the USA with 685 boats sailing worldwide. The class association is an owner managed organization with strict one-design rules. In addition to its active use in one design sailing, the J/105s affordability makes it an attractive choice for PHRF and Single/Double handed offshore sailing. J/105s are also well suited for community sailing programs training high school age sailors in keel boat and offshore racing. In 2008, J/Boats announced that new J/105 production commenced at the US Watercraft facility in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Hull #672 was the first of this production, with at least two more confirmed produced (#673, #674) in fall 2008, made from construction molds copied from French molds. Base price was $159,000 USD as of fall 2008 not including options. The last five hulls, #681-685 were produced in United States and all shipped to customers in Chile where a fleet of over 25 exists. US Watercraft was also the official builder for the International J/22 (since 2001) and International J/24 (since 1999), however US Watercraft is currently in receivership and its future is uncertain.

Early and family life Born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, Thomas attended local schools as a child and went on to graduate from a private academy in 1838. Career Thomas read law and was admitted to the bar in 1844, commencing practice in Martinsville, Virginia. He served in the Confederate Virginia Senate from 1860 to 1864 and was member of the commission to settle the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina. Thomas also served as prosecuting attorney for Henry County, Virginia (surrounding Martinsville), and in 1867 was elected to serve the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868. After approval of the new state Constitution (and rejection of a proposed provision forbidding former Confederates from holding office), Thomas served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1869, both succeeding fellow Confederate delegate and Conservative George W. Booker and being succeeded by him. In 1872, Thomas ran as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives for Virginia's 5th district. He ran against former Confederate officer and Conservative Democrat Alexander Davis, who was initially declared the victor, but Thomas contested the result and was seated. However, Thomas served only a single term from 1874 to 1875, losing his reelection bid in 1874 to Democrat George Cabell, another lawyer and former Confederate officer active in railroad promotion. Death and legacy Thomas resumed practicing law until his death in Martinsville, Virginia on February 11, 1879. He was interred in the family cemetery on Leatherwood plantation.

However, it is doubtful that this language will survive much into the 21st century.

There are many indigenous terms in \\"camba\\" (Spanish of the Beni) but they mostly of Guaran√≠ origin carried to the Beni by the original settlers from Santa Cruz.

The head of UDA activity in the area during one of the organisation's most active phases, Bratty was suspected by security forces of playing a role in, or at least orchestrating, around 15 killings. Early years Bratty first came to attention in his native Ballynafeigh (an area in south Belfast) as a teenage street-fighter battling with local Catholic/republican youths and was responsible for altering the Workers' Party of Ireland slogan \\"Sectarianism Kills Workers\\" on the side of Havelock House to \\"Sectarianism Kills Taigs\\".McDonald and Cusack 2004, p. 270 Bratty, who was also known for his hatred of black people, also appended the initials of the Ku Klux Klan to this piece of graffiti. During his years as a street-fighter, Bratty, who had distinctive oriental shaped eyes, was given the nickname 'Chinky' by his Catholic opponents. Given the proximity of the two communities on the Ormeau Road, Bratty had grown up alongside Catholics and as such had for a number of years been accused of terrorising people he knew to be Catholic with beatings and intimidation before becoming involved in murder around 1990.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p.184 UDA activity Ulster Freedom Fighters insignia continues to be displayed in the Annadale Flats area, January 2012 Eventually, Bratty became head of the UDA in Ballynafeigh, leading his own unit from Annadale Flats. Bratty's unit struck on 7 September 1990 when they entered the house of a 34-year-old Catholic, Emmanuel Shields, and shot him dead as he lay in bed with his pregnant girlfriend. According to his family, Shields, who had a criminal record but not for republican activity, had regularly been targeted by Bratty and his associates for physical attack in the past and they had fired shots into his mother's house in nearby Burmah Street when he lived with her. Bratty christened his unit 'Ku Klux Klan', and members of the group, including himself, had the initials KKK tattooed on their arms.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 1373 Bratty, together with Stephen \\"Inch\\" McFerran, UDA military commander for the Ormeau area and RUC Special Branch agent, ordered the attack on the lower Ormeau branch of Sean Graham's bookmakers on 5 February 1992, an act resulting in the death of five civilian men.McDonald and Cusack 1997, p. 285 His right-hand man, Raymond Elder, was identified by witnesses as one of the gunmen in the attack, and fibres from the getaway car were found on his denims. Bratty was widely believed to have been present during the attack, although the rest of the team that Bratty sent was made up of UDA members from East Belfast rather than local members.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p. 224 Another gunman had been provided by UDA West Belfast Brigade leader Johnny Adair, who had first conceived of the action.Lister and Jordan 2004 p. 134 Alex Kerr, Bratty's commanding officer as South Belfast brigadier, commended the attack, claiming that Lower Ormeau residents had been involved in shielding republicans before suggesting that the attack was revenge for the Teebane bombing. In addition to the 5 February Ormeau Road shootings, Bratty's unit was allegedly involved in the murder of Michael Gilbride, a Catholic taxi driver who had settled in the Lower Ormeau area.McDonald and Cusack, 2004, p. 238 Gilbride was killed outside his parents' home on Fernwood Street not far from Bratty's Annadale Flats base.Sutton Index of Deaths 1992 Another victim was Donna Wilson, a Protestant and resident of Annadale Flats who had recently moved to the area from Tullycarnet, East Belfast. A number of residents had complained to Bratty in his role as local UDA commander about the noise of her stereo and he assembled a team of ten men armed with baseball bats who broke in, beat her to death (seriously injuring three of her companions) and wrecked the flat. In the end, only a sixty-year-old who had led the complaints to Bratty was charged in relation to Wilson's death.McDonald and Cusack 2004, pp. 238-39 Bratty was also identified as the getaway driver for the attack in which Teresa Clinton, the wife of a Sinn F√©in election candidate, was murdered in her Lower Ormeau home.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p. 255 Thomas \\"Tucker\\" Annett, one of Bratty's closest lieutenants, was identified as the main gunman although not charged. Annett died on 12 July 1996 as part of an internal UDA dispute when two fellow members of the organisation kicked him to death outside a bar on the Ormeau Road. One of the killers has since been identified as Stephen \\"Inch\\" McFerran.\\"Guilty plea meant loyalist's double life remained secret\\". Irish News. Barry McCaffrey. 13 April 2007 retrieved 28 May 2015 Death Bratty was first targeted in late 1991 by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) when they decided to adopt the tactic of focusing on prominent loyalist paramilitaries alongside the security forces. Bratty's Annadale Flats home was attacked on 13 November, but Bratty was not at home and no one was hurt.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 104 Some time after this attack, Bratty moved from the Annadale Flats to live in Greenwood Lodge on the Upper Newtownards Road in East Belfast.McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, p. 1372 Bratty and Raymond Elder were shot dead by the IRA on 31 July 1994, in an act seen as one of a number of \\"revenge attacks\\" immediately prior to the IRA ceasefire. The pair had been drinking in the Kimberley Bar off the Ormeau Road unaware that two gunmen were waiting outside in a van, and both died at the scene of the attack.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p. 269 The gunmen were armed with AK-47 assault rifles.Lister &Jordan;, Mad Dog, p. 225 The getaway car was pursued by a Royal Ulster Constabulary vehicle that was in the area but the chase stopped when the police vehicle was impeded by a crowd of republicans. Bratty was 33 years old at the time of his death.Loyalists pledge to avenge shootings: Ian MacKinnon finds tension running high in parts of Belfast after the latest sectarian killings, with IRA gunmen promised a 'summary execution' He left behind a widow and three children. His son was given honorary membership of the Paisley Imperial Blues flute band, the leading UDA-aligned flute band in Scotland, immediately following his father's death.Wood 2006, p. 337 Reaction Contemporaneous graffiti celebrating the killings of Bratty and Elder, still extant in 2017. Lower Ormeau Road The killing of Bratty was greeted with relief, even by some nationalist residents of the Lower Ormeau normally opposed to violence. However, the aftermath saw three Catholics killed by the UDA in separate attacks with these sparking a series of IRA bomb attacks on loyalist bars, thus bringing about a temporary return to the spiral of tit-for-tat killing.McDonald and Cusack 2004, pp. 259-70 The killings of Bratty and Elder, along with that of Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) leader Ray Smallwoods earlier the same month, played a central role in delaying the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire. The CLMC had been considering declaring a ceasefire following the Loughinisland massacre, but reversed their decision after these three killings as they believed that any cessation of violence would have then been seen as a sign of weakness.Taylor 2004, p. 231 This was confirmed by the UDP's David Adams, who said the CLMC was ready to call a ceasefire in late June/early July 1994, although his party colleague Gary McMichael admitted the killings of Bratty and Smallwoods convinced him that an IRA ceasefire was near as he felt these were long- standing targets who were being killed before calling a halt to hostilities.Wood 2006, p. 189 Certain hardline elements with the UDA would later claim that Bratty's killing had been sanctioned by members of the CLMC who were eager to see a ceasefire as Bratty had been an outspoken opponent of the initiative, although these allegations were never proven. Pastor Kenny McClinton, a dissident former UDA gunman who was variously associated with the Ulster Independence Movement, the Loyalist Volunteer Force and the Orange Volunteers, even suggested in a pamphlet that Bratty's killing had been arranged by the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP). This was part of a wider theme in McClinton's writing arguing that the PUP was a front for MI5 activity.McDonald and Cusack 2004, p.283 Bratty and Elder were commemorated in a wall plaque erected outside the Kimberley Bar. The pub, where the pair had been on the day they were killed, was known as a UDA stronghold in the area.Wood 2006, pp. 288-89 In 2007, a banner honouring Bratty during Twelfth of July celebrations by members of the Orange Order was met by outrage from the relatives of those Bratty allegedly killed. An August 2014 march commemorating the pair was condemned by both nationalist politicians and the Ulster Unionist Party after it ended with a ceremony in a Housing Executive- funded First World War garden of remembrance close to the Annadale Flats.

Early life  He belonged to the noble family of the Manassei and was a Doctor of Medicine and well versed in letters and philosophy before he entered the Order of Friars Minor in Umbria.  Religious work  After devoting himself assiduously to the study of theology, Barnabas began to preach with wonderful success, but a severe illness obliged him to abandon this work. He was almost continually employed in different offices of importance. He proved himself a zealous promoter of that branch of the order known as the Observance.  Founding of first mont de pi√©t√©  After consulting his fellow religious Fortunatus Coppoli, who had been an eminent jurisconsult, and with the generous co- operation of the wealthy Perugians, Barnabas established the first Monte di Piet√†, a charitable loan-institution, in their city in 1462. Violent opposition ensued, but Barnabas and Fortunatus prevailed over their enemies at a public disputation. Barnabas next extended his work to other cities; it was enthusiastically taken up by several great Franciscan missionaries, and in their day, the monti di piet√† wonderfully improved the social conditions of Italy.  Death  He died at the Eremo delle Carceri on Monte Subasio at an advanced age and his remains were deposited there in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene.

The story follows the tiny Tom Thumb as he is abducted from his loving parents and taken to an experimental laboratory, and his subsequent escape. He discovers a community of similarly-sized people living in a swamp, who help him on his journey to return to his parents. The film is largely dialogue-free, limited mostly to grunts and other non-verbal vocalisations. Plot Inside an artificial insemination factory, a mechanical wasp hovering around the establishment is crushed to death by the machinery's gears, causing its vitals to drop into one of the jars on the conveyor belt. This results in a woman giving birth to a thumb-sized fetus- like child in her and her husband's house in a grim and slum urban town. Outside, a man in a black suit witnesses the whole scene and goes to an alley to encounter Pa Thumb, who picks up a ventriloquist box-shaped doll house to make his son's bedroom. The man simply grins at the him but leaves when he gets creeped out by the ventriloquist's dummy at the window of a toy shop. Pa and Ma Thumb raise their son and decide to call him \\"Tom Thumb\\". Production  The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb was made using a combination of stop- motion animation and pixilation (live actors posed and shot frame-by-frame), often with live actors and puppets sharing the frame. It was originally commissioned as a 10-minute short for BBC2's Christmas programming, but was rejected for being too dark for the festive season. The short version nevertheless garnered critical acclaim through showings at animation festivals, and a feature-length version was commissioned by the BBC a year later.

Biography  Locker graduated from George High School in 1956, where he played baseball and basketball. He enrolled at Iowa State University, and made the varsity team in both sports. Locker graduated from ISU in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in geology and was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After graduation, he signed his first professional baseball contract, with the Chicago White Sox.  Career  =Minor Leagues (1960‚Äì61, 1964)= Locker began his professional career in 1960 at Idaho Falls, appearing in a handful of games. The next year, he made 33 starts, winning 15 games, pitching 228 innings and leading the Three-I league with 215 strikeouts. Locker missed the next two seasons due to military service. He returned to baseball in 1964, and winning 16 games for Indianapolis. It would be his last year in the minors. =Chicago White Sox (1965‚Äì1969)= At age 27, Bob Locker had made the big leagues, joining a bullpen that featured knuckleballers Hoyt Wilhelm and Eddie Fisher.

Locker settled down, however, and in a stretch from May 30 to June 20‚Äî10 total appearances‚Äîhe was unscored upon. He would finish his rookie campaign with 93‚Öì innings pitched and a 3.15 earned-run average. During his time in Chicago, Locker was the most often-used reliever. He appeared in 77 games in 1967 and 70 games in 1968. In 1969, Locker got off to a rough start (2‚Äì3 record, 6.55 ERA), and on June 8, the White Sox shipped him to the expansion Seattle Pilots for Gary Bell. =Seattle Pilots (1969) / Milwaukee Brewers (1970)= Upon arriving in Seattle, the 31-year-old Locker began a reversal of fortune, posting a 2.18 ERA for an expansion team that would finish in last place in the division. He finished the season with a flourish, allowing just eight runs in his last 30 appearances on the season. When the Seattle Pilots moved to Milwaukee at the end of spring training, 1970, Locker went with them. He didn't stay there long; after appearing in 28 games for the Brewers, Locker's contract was purchased by the Oakland Athletics. =Oakland Athletics (1970‚Äì1972)= Locker made his presence felt once he arrived in Oakland, having allowed no runs in his first seven innings for the Athletics. His most impressive outing came on August 12, 1970, against the Cleveland Indians, in which he pitched 5‚Öî of scoreless relief, the longest outing of his career. In 1972, Locker was a key member of the World Series champion team, posting a 6‚Äì1 record and 2.65 ERA, often appearing in the seventh and eighth innings as the setup man for closer Rollie Fingers. Locker struggled in the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, giving up three runs in two innings of work. On October 21, he made his first and only World Series appearance, relieving Vida Blue with two outs in the sixth inning of Game 6. He gave up a single to Tony P√©rez but got the final out of the inning before being removed for a pinch-hitter. A month later, Oakland traded Locker to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Billy North. =Chicago Cubs (1973, 1975)= Pitching in the National League for the first time, Locker had one of his best seasons, winning 10 games, saving 18 and topping 100 innings pitched for the first time since 1969. In an odd twist, in November the Cubs sent him back to Oakland. According to Bruce Markusen in his 1998 book, Baseball's Last Dynasty: Charlie Finley's Oakland A's, Locker had told Cubs general manager John Holland that he would only pitch one season for the Cubs, then he wanted to be traded back to the A's as owner Charlie Finley had agreed to try to arrange. Locker moved his family to Oakland and planned to live and work there after his baseball career. Holland and Charlie Finley obliged the pitcher's request but it turned out to be a bad deal for the A's. Locker had to undergo surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow and would sit out the entire 1974 season. Finley sent Locker back to the Cubs just days after winning the 1974 World Series in exchange for veteran outfielder Billy Williams. Locker's 1975 season would be his last in the majors. Retirement Since April 2010, Locker has been the creator and webmaster of a Marvin Miller tribute site, ThanksMarvin.com. The site collects memorabilia about the late Major League Baseball Player Association Executive Director in an attempt to raise awareness of Miller's importance in the American Labor Unions in the United States and to get Miller elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame when his name comes up for a ballot in 2014 as part of the \\"Expansion Era\\" group. Miller passed away on November 27, 2012 at the age of 95, but was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in December 2019, for induction in 2020.

It was particularly popular in Hong Kong and South Korea. There were three versions of this system made, unofficially called Mark I, Mark II and Voice Command Lock-On. The Mark I and Mark II versions operated the same and differed in their overall appearance. Each system consists of a headset and a gun for each player, the aim being to shoot the opponent's headset. The headset required one 9-Volt battery while the gun required two C batteries. The Mark II headset used four AAA batteries instead of the single 9V one. Each gun and headset was able to select between two teams, A and B. A gun set to team A could only hit a headset set to team B and vice versa. This way friendly fire was not possible. The guns have a primary trigger which can be pressed once for a single shot or held for continuous fire, with an unlimited number of shots. A second trigger called the high power button is located on the left hand side of the gun and when pressed gives a quick tone indicating that a high powered shot is ready. If, within a few seconds, the main trigger is then pressed, a high power shot would be fired. This high power shot would take off three hit points from a headset, whereas a normal shot would take off one. When turned on, each headset would start at nine hit points and when shot would count down and display the remaining hit points. When they reached zero, the headset sounds a death tone and the player is tagged out.

The user would activate the headset, and during the power-on process, would shoot at the headset from the gun. The headset would go dark and silent for a random period of time before beeping and lighting up, indicating a target to shoot. After a short interval, if the user didn't shoot it, it would go dark. The process would then continue.

Coppinger was a real person, but various legends grew up around him, lending him near superhuman powers and a fearsome reputation. He is portrayed as huge and fearsome Dane who after being shipwrecked off Cornwall became the leader of a feared band of smugglers. Legend The legend of Cruel Coppinger recognised today, is that recorded by Rev. Robert Stephen Hawker, the composer of the Cornish anthem The Song of the Western Men, who collected the existing legends and, with a few additions of his own, published them in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words in 1866. His story was prefaced with the verse: Will you hear of Cruel Coppinger He came from a foreign land; He was brought to us by the salt water, He was carried away by the wind! According to the legend, one night, during a great storm, a ship got into trouble near the shore of Cornwall. The local inhabitants turned out to the beach as they often would when there was a chance that a ship would be wrecked and valuable commodities washed up on shore. On the deck of the ship they saw the lone figure of a huge man, who, leaping into the sea, waded through the surf until he reached the shore. There he grabbed the cloak of an old woman and leapt up on the horse of a young woman who had come down to the shore. Shouting something in a foreign tongue, later held to be the language of the Vikings, he rode off with the girl and made his way to her house where he installed himself, uninvited. He announced himself as Coppinger from Denmark, and little-by-little secured the favour of Dinah Hamlyn, the girl he had carried off. Eventually he secured her hand in marriage. He mysteriously raised enough money to buy himself a house and lands, and set himself up as the leader of a feared band of smugglers, wreckers and pirates in Cornwall. He controlled a number of bridle paths and footpaths which converged at a steep cliff, at the foot of which was a cave where he kept his booty and stolen livestock. To discourage surveillance by the Revenue Officers, one of his gang beheaded one of them. Among the ships used by the \\"Cruel\\" gang was the Black Prince, a ship built to Coppinger's own design in the shipyards of Denmark, with which he terrorised the English Channel. Using his knowledge of the waters of the Cornish coast he lured a Revenue cutter into the shallow waters of a cove and wrecked her. When his father-in-law died Coppinger was eager to secure the remainder of his money, and to force his widowed mother-in-law to hand it over, he would threaten to whip his wife with a cat-o-nine-tails. His son was born a deaf-mute. It was said that because of his father's crime, he was born without a soul. He was known to be mischievous and cruel, and one day was found laughing at the top of cliff, at the bottom of which was the body of a neighbour's child. Coppinger is said to have disappeared one night when the pressure from the Revenue Officers finally became too much. A lone man saw him put out in small boat to a ship anchored off shore, which raised its sails and disappeared into the night. Coppinger was \\"carried away with the wind\\" and never seen again. History Little is known of the real Coppinger. Two possible models are John Coppinger who arrived in Cornwall in around 1793 and Daniel Coppinger who was shipwrecked in 1792. It is likely that the Cruel Coppinger of legend is based on an amalgamation of the two. John Coppinger was of Danish stock, but his family had established itself in Ireland. Reports in his family history suggest he left Cork in about 1760, and moved to Roscoff in Brittany where he had estates. His property in Brittany was destroyed during the French Revolution in 1793 and around this time he moved to Cornwall where he bought an estate named Trewhiddle, near St Austell. It is likely that he supplied contraband from Brittany to Cornwall Daniel Coppinger is closer to the version of Cruel Coppinger in the legend. Shipwrecked in 1792, he married a woman named Hamlyn, though she was much older than the young girl featured in the legend and was called Ann rather than Dinah. He had property in Hartland and was known to be a \\"Free Trader\\" (a pirate or smuggler). He claimed to be a former Navy surgeon; a Coppinger did serve in the Royal Navy as a surgeon around that time, but whether these two were the same person is unknown.

After serving the Angevin kings of England, in 1202 he changed his loyalty to King Philip II of France and became a leading member of his government. Origins Born about 1160, his origins are unknown but he is taken to be from the same family of knightly status in or near Ch√¢teau-du-Loir that produced his contemporary Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester.Some sources give his father as Baldwin des Roches and his mother as Alice de Ch√¢tellerault, while a suggested birthplace is Longu√©-Jumelles. Early career William des Roches early in his life had been a mesnie knight of King Henry II of England. During the rebellion of 1189, Richard of Poitou (later Richard I of England) and King Philip II of France attacked the ageing king of England in the city of his birth, Le Mans. Guillaume had participated in the defense of Le Mans in the company of such knights as William Marshal and Gerard Talbot and was with King Henry when he was forced to flee the city. According to \\"The History of William the Marshal\\", des Roches rode in the vanguard of the retreating royal force. He wheeled around with William Marshal and engaged Count Richard's vanguard where he successfully charged and knocked Philip de Colombiers off of his horse. After the death of King Henry, Guillaume enrolled in the royal mesnie of Richard, now King of England, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine and Count of Anjou. William was a trusted confidant of King Richard, and during the Third Crusade he was involved in the conquest of Sicily, the Siege of Acre, the Battle of Arsuf, and the Battle of Jaffa. In 1192, he was sent with Pierre de Preaux and Gerard de Fournival as part of a deputation to obtain safe conducts for the crusading host to enter Jerusalem and its environs. William remained a steadfast adherent to Richard in his wars with King Philip of France from 1194‚Äì1199 and it may have been at this time that he was arranged to be married to Marguerite, the daughter and heiress of Robert de Sabl√©. Angevin Civil War At the death of Richard at Chalus in April 1199, the Angevin kingship faced a serious succession dispute between Prince John of England, brother of King Richard, and Arthur of Brittany, Richard's nephew. The leaders of England, Normandy, and Poitou sided with John, while the barons of Anjou and Brittany chose Arthur according to their customs of succession. William, then at Le Mans, threw in his support for Arthur along with a very powerful group of Manceaux and Angevin barons, including Juhel II of Mayenne and his mother Isabella of Meulan. Des Roches became Arthur's seneschal of Anjou and was entrusted with the defense of Le Mans. The city of Tours was surrendered to Arthur and Eleanor, duchess of Aquitaine and queen-mother of England. In addition, she was Arthur's grandmother. She sent a force under Viscount Aimery VII of Thouars, John's newly appointed seneschal of Anjou (replacing Robert of Turnham), Hugh IX of Lusignan, and his brother Raoul I of Exoudun, count of Eu. Eleanor's force was successful in entering the suburbs of Tours, but was driven back by King Philip II of France who had himself chosen Arthur as Richard's rightful successor. In May 1199, King Philip of France met with William des Roches at Le Mans and together they attacked the border fortress of Ballon, the fortress was surrendered by Geoffrey de Br√ªlon, the castellan, but not before being demolished. A quarrel ensued between King Philip and William over the lordship of the site. William was adamant that Ballon belonged rightfully to Duke Arthur, while King Philip wished to retain it as his own. In June 1199, King John of England launched a massive attack into Northern Maine from Argentan. On 13 September he was successful in repulsing King Philip from the fortress of Lavardin which protected the route from Le Mans to Tours. Arthur's supporters were forced to come to terms with John, and William met with the English king at Bourg-le-Roi, a fortress of the pro-John viscounts of Beaumont-en-Maine on or about 18 September. John convinced William that Arthur of Brittany was being used solely as tool of Capetian strategy and managed to convince him to switch sides. With this, John promised him the seneschalship of Anjou. During the night, John's incumbent seneschal, Viscount Aimery, took Arthur and Constance and fled the court. They fled first to Angers, then to the court of King Philip. King John officially designated William seneschal of Anjou in December 1199 and entered Angers triumphantly on 24 June 1200. During the summer of 1201, William married Marguerite de Sabl√©. With this marriage came a vast landholding that included Sabl√©, La Suze, Briollay, Maiet, Loupeland√©, Genneteil, Precign√©, and the Norman manor of Agon (which was held of the lord of Mayenne). William had become overnight one of the greatest barons of Anjou and Maine and relative-in-law to the most exclusive houses of the region. Coinciding with a renewed French attack on upper Normandy, Arthur along with many prominent knights of France and Poitou attempted to capture Eleanor of Aquitaine as she traveled from Anjou to her chief seat at Poitiers. Taking refuge in the castle of Mirebeau on the road just north of Poitiers, she came under siege. William agreed to help John with the relief of the castle as long as any prisoners captured were treated within common custom. He led a large contingent of Angevin knights along with Aimery of Thouars (now returned to favor with John by the diplomacy of Eleanor of Aquitaine) in John's company, and they arrived outside the castle on the night of 31 July 1202. The Battle of Mirebeau, fought the following day, was a decisive victory for King John in which Duke Arthur of Brittany was captured. Many of the prisoners captured were important Poitevins and Bretons that were grossly mistreated, including royal relatives like the viscount Hugh of Ch√¢tellerault and Andr√© de Chauvigny, they were starved to death. Arthur himself disappeared in John's Norman prisons and many, including the French king, came to the conclusion that Arthur was in fact murdered by his uncle, King John. William immediately left John's service (between 17 and 25 August) and departed to the court of Juhel de Mayenne. John sent soldiers to secure Angers and Tours and revoked William's seneschalship. King John then split the office and gave the seneschalship of Anjou to Brice the Chamberlain, a mercenary in his pay. The seneschalship of Tours was given to another mercenary captain, Martin Algais. Des Roches launched an attack on Angers and captured the city on 30 October 1202. Simultaneously, Sulpice III d'Amboise captured the town, but not the citadel at Tours. In January 1203, John mustered an army at Argentan for the reconquest of his Loire provinces. John took up court in Alen√ßon and then Le Mans while his army was mustering. While in Le Mans he learned of the treachery of the count of Sees who had usurped authority in the town of Alen√ßon ( a town that belonged to his grandfather, Count William Talvas, up to 1166). Along with Count Robert of Sees rebelled Viscount Ralph of Beaumont. With two great barons of northern Maine now in the French camp, John's chances of retaining even Maine were reduced significantly. John, avoiding fortresses belonging to rebels, slowly made his way back to his army at Argentan. Alen√ßon was offered to King Philip of France by the rebellious count in return for Philip's recognition of his comital authority over the area and possession of the family's castle at La Roche-Mabile. While the barons of northern Maine kept John busy, William and a league of barons from the region including Maurice III of Craon, Thibaud V of Blaison, Bernard III of La Ferte, and Juhel II of Mayenne traveled to Paris and offered their homage and fealty to King Philip of France. With this, King Philip launched his forces into Anjou to attack strongholds that still held out for John. Saumur was captured in April 1203 and Beaufort-en-Vall√©e and Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Sarthe fell soon thereafter. William, and his forces launched an attack on Le Mans and captured the city by about 17 May. One of John's final acts of 1203 was to bring Alen√ßon under siege in August, he was unsuccessful in capturing the castle, and with many of his Norman castles under siege or already captured (including Vaudreuil), he must have known that the end of Angevin rule north of the Loire was upon him. King Philip triumphant William's family had originated from the lesser aristocracy, knights from Chateau-du-Loir, a castle that was granted as a dowry property of King Richard's widow, Berengaria of Navarre. Guillaume arranged for the exchange of his lordship of Le Mans (split with the bishop and the hereditary Manceaux seneschals, the 'Mauchien' family) for Berengaria's castle which he then became lord of. The exchange was ratified by King Philip. King Philip had conquered Normandy (receiving the surrender of Peter de Preaux at Rouen in April 1204. Philip had then marched through Anjou and entered Poitiers after the death of Duchess Eleanor on 1 April. It was in Poitiers that Philip officially granted the hereditary seneschalship on to William. By a later charter (1206) William received custody of Angers, Loudun, Saumur, Brissac, Beaufort, and \\"all the land of Anjou\\" at the King's pleasure. The lasting settlement arranged in 1208 had King Philip retain authority in Touraine with the castles of Chinon, Bourgueil, Loudun, Saumur, and Langeais. William was granted custody of all of Anjou and Maine including the fortresses of Bauge and Chateauneuf-sur-Sarthe. In addition, William was granted the \\"third penny\\" of justice in Anjou and one mark of silver per fifty livres of demesnial revenue. He was also permitted to assign baillis to assist him, Hamelin de Roorta being the most prominent. Coincidentally, Aimery of Thouars was conferred the seneschalship of Poitou by King Philip to similar terms with exception to the added revenue. King John's senechal of Poitou for 1205 had been Savaric of Mauleon, who was limited to the Aunis coastline and later in the year the castle of Niort. Des Roches and Dreux of Mello, constable of France conducted the attack in Touraine culminating with capture of John's last Angevin fortresses, Chinon and Loches. Hubert de Burgh, John's castellan of both locations was forced to surrender in June 1205. In 1206, John restabilized his rule in Poitou, Guienne, and Gascony, driving Castilian forces from Bourg, Bayonne, and Dax. Leading barons of Poitou preferred the absentee rule of King John to the more autocratic rule of King Philip; the Thouars, Mauleon, Lusignan, Parthenay, and Sugeres families all allied with King John. William set out with a force of knights to defend the Roman road connecting Tours and Poitiers. Other than a brief occupation of Angers, John was unsuccessful in making further progress north of the Loire. John departed after signing a two-year truce with King Philip that recognized the status quo. As soon as the truce was up in 1208, William and Dreux de Mello (based at Loches) collected some 300 knights and launched numerous attacks on Thouars holdings in Poitou. Albigensian Crusade and later life William took the cross in 1209 and left Anjou to crusade in the Toulousain and Languedoc with the Eudes III of Burgundy against the Cathar heretics. He was active at the siege of B√©ziers in July and Carcassonne in August. He wouldn't again participate in the Albigensian Crusade until 1219 at the Siege of Marmande under Prince Louis (later Louis VIII of France, the eldest son and heir of King Philip II of France. King John again attacked Anjou from the south during the Bouvines Campaign of 1214. John was repulsed from Nantes but was able to enter Angers on 17 June. John moved out of the city to reduce the local forts, two succumbed quickly, but the garrison of the new fort at La Roche-aux- Moines, located just south of Angers, held out. An army of 800 knights under the command of the seneschal, Prince Louis, Amauri I de Craon, and Henri Clement, marshal of France collected at Chinon. John was deserted by his Thouars and Lusignan allies upon hearing of the collection of so great a force. On 2 July 1214, William and Prince Louis were victorious at the Battle of La Roche-aux-Moines and forced John to retreat clear to La Rochelle. The seneschal died in 1222 and his eldest daughter, Jeanne brought the Sable barony and the hereditary seneschalship to her husband, Amauri de Craon.

Campers can canoe for a radius of in all directions. The majority of the adjacent land is owned by the state and is utilized as a state park. History In 1916 Ray K. Phillips established the Cedar Island Camp for girls on Fourth Lake, near Inlet, New York. In 1920 the Cedar Island Corporation, of which she was a member, purchased the Antlers Hotel on Raquette Lake and she moved the girls' camp to the Antlers property, changing the name to Raquette Lake Girls Camp. Construction on the present girls' camp site began in 1922. At that time she formed a partnership with Max Berg to build a boys' camp across the lake on Woods Point (Timm, 1989). In 1951 Philips and Berg sold their camps on Raquette Lake. The hotel was acquired by S. & I. Hotels, the girls' camp by Lee Krinsky, and the boys' camp by Phil Drucker and Gordon Liebowitz (Timm, 1989). The boys' and girls' camps then operated as separately owned \\"brother and sister\\" camps. Drucker and Liebowitz sold the boys' camp to Dave Gold in 1967 and Krinsky sold the girls' camp in 1973 to Jerry Halsband, who also purchased the boys' camp from Gold, returning the two camps to unified ownership after 22 years. He owned both camps until 2000. From 1981 through 1995 Helene (Falk) Leibowitz (1943-2008) was head counselor. The \\"Helene Leibowitz\\" camper spirit awards named for her are given at the final campfire. At times through their history the camps have alternately been named Raquette Lake Girls Club, Raquette Lake Boys Club, but have always been private, tuition-based summer camps. Campers in the 1950s and 1960s travelled overnight by train in sleeping cars from Grand Central Station in New York City to the Thendara station, then transferred to the Town of Webb school buses to reach Raquette Lake. Girls were dropped off at their camp site but boys needed to walk down to the Antlers dock to ride the barge across to Woods Point.Timm, R. (1989). Raquette Lake: A time to remember.

Officials state the aircraft did pass safety checks prior to its departure. Boeing announced that they would also provide technical assistance to both the authorities and the airline during the course of the investigation. The final report from the NTSC stated that the probable cause of the accident was an excessive sink rate upon touchdown, following an unstabilised approach. In the report, the NTSC noted that the approach was unstable below , with a vertical speed occasionally greater than 2500 ft/min (13 m/s). The vertical acceleration on landing was measured at 5 g. Additionally, the aircraft initially touched down with the right main gear approximately outside of the runway edge. The investigation further revealed that there was no technical malfunction on the aircraft prior to touchdown. The flight crew was criticised for not maintaining a sterile cockpit during the landing, with excessive non- flight related discussion going on throughout the flight. Unusually for an aircraft accident investigation, the investigative committee was not provided information as to the identities of the aircraft flight crew. Safety concerns The safety record of Adam Air was heavily criticised, especially in the aftermath of Flight 574. Pilots reported repeated and deliberate breaches of international safety regulations, with aircraft being flown in non- airworthy states for months at a time. They claimed that there had been such incidents as requests to sign documents to allow an aircraft to fly while not having the authority to and while knowing the plane to be not airworthy, flying a plane for several months with a damaged door handle, swapping parts between aircraft to avoid mandatory replacement deadlines, being ordered to fly aircraft after exceeding the take-off limit of five times per pilot per day, flying an aircraft with a damaged window, using spare parts from other aircraft to keep planes in the air, and the ignoring of pilots' requests not to take off due to unsafe aircraft. The Associated Press quoted one pilot as saying that \\"Every time you flew, you had to fight with the ground staff and the management about all the regulations you had to violate.\\" They also claim that if pilots confronted their seniors in the airline, they were grounded or docked pay.\\"Falling skies for Indonesian aviation\\" .

It was commissioned on 30 September 1965. An explosion occurred during refueling of the submarine at Chazhma Bay, Vladivostok. There were ten fatalities and 49 other people suffered radiation injuries. TIME magazine has identified the accident as one of the world's \\"worst nuclear disasters\\". Reactor refueling disaster K-431, completed around 1965 as unit K-31, was a Project 675 (Echo II)-class submarine with two pressurized water reactors, each 70 MWt capacity and using 20% enriched uranium as fuel.Some sources confuse this submarine with K-314, a Project 671 or Victor I class submarine launched in 1972 and withdrawn from service after a reactor accident in December 1985. On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor tank lid was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly and had to be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control rods was lifted up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a criticality excursion of about 5¬∑1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the machine enclosures, ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as in a swath long and wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products. In part because the reactor did not contain spent fuel, the fraction of biologically active isotopes was far smaller than in the case of the Chernobyl disaster. M. Takano et al. suggest that only 29 GBq of I-131 was released, but larger amounts (620 GBq of I-133 and 1840 GBq of I-135) of other isotopes. The same source suggests that the total release was about 259 PBq but due to radioactive decay this decreased to 43 TBq after 24 hours. The same source suggests that the fission yield was 5¬∑1018 fissions which would deliver 156 MJ of heat into the reactor. Ten naval personnel were killed (8 officers and 2 enlisted men), probably by the explosion itself and not from radiation injuries. Radiation injuries were observed in 49 people, with 10 developing radiation sickness; the latter figure included mostly firefighters, some of whom sustained doses up to 220 rad (2.2 Gy) external and 400 rem (4 Sv) to the thyroid gland. Of the 2,000 involved in cleanup operations, 290 were exposed to high levels of radiation compared to normal standards. High-level waste gathered during clean-up operations was placed in temporary disposal sites. Due to the rapid decay of most of the fission products and the cleanup operations, some dockyard facilities were able to resume operations four days later. About two months post-accident the radioactivity in water in the cove was comparable to background levels, and 5‚Äì7 months post-accident the radiation levels were considered normal throughout the dock area. The damaged submarine was towed to Pavlovsk Bay and berthed there.

The previous year they were ranked 39th. That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters. Entrance to company headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon, which is adjacent to the Mentor Graphics campus. In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants. FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations. The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million. The next month FLIR executed its third stock split. FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million. For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company. On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P; 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation. FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the Seattle Times in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003). It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009, and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million. FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million. In December 2012 FLIR acquired Lorex Technology Inc. for approximately $60 million. On November 30, 2015 FLIR announced that it had acquired DVTEL, Inc, a leader in software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately $92 million in cash. In November 2016, FLIR acquired Point Grey Research for $259 million. This acquisition made FLIR the owner of the Brickstream brand of camera products. In December 2016, FLIR acquired Prox Dynamics, the makers of the Black Hornet, a nano-drone used by the military and law enforcement for surveillance and reconnaissance, for $134 million.

Birth and education Philip Euen Mitchell was born on 1 May 1890 in London to a Scottish family. His father, Captain Hugh Mitchell (1849‚Äì1937) had served in the Royal Engineers, and after retiring had studied law at the Inner Temple and had become a barrister. His father had played for the Royal Engineers team in the 1872 FA Cup Final. His mother, Mary Catherine n√©e Creswell, died when he was two years old, and his father moved to Gibraltar where he built up his legal practice, living at Campamento in Spain. Philip was educated by a French tutor, becoming equally fluent in English, French and Spanish. He won a scholarship to St Paul's School, London. From St Paul's, he won a classical scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford. While at university he was a friend of Joyce Cary. His behaviour was often wild, risking encounters with the police or the university proctors. He was physically strong and good at most games, particularly golf. He dropped out of University after two years and after losing his scholarship could not afford to return. Early career Mitchell joined the Colonial Administrative Service in 1913. He was sent to Zomba District in Nyasaland as an assistant resident. While there he learned the Nyanja language, with some difficulty since it is a Bantu language completely unrelated to European languages. He served in the King's African Rifles during World War I (1914‚Äì1918). During this period he became completely fluent in the Swahili language. In 1922 he was promoted to District Commissioner at Tanga, a seaport on the coast of Tanganyika near the Kenyan border. In 1925, while on leave in South Africa, he married Margery Tyrwhitt-Drake. As Tanganyika Secretary for Native Affairs, in 1929 Mitchell supported cooperatives, and claimed that \\"in a sense every Bantu village is in fact a co-operative society\\". The Tanganyika government did not act on his recommendation, using lack of staff and budget as the reason. Colonial governor =Uganda= Mitchell was appointed Governor of Uganda in 1935. During the depression, capital expenditure in Uganda had been slashed, and public infrastructure and services had deteriorated. In 1936, Mitchell appointed a committee to set priorities for development and to provide for financing. He saw a need to completely review the relationship between Buganda and the government of the Protectorate. He was concerned with political reform, recognising that the eventual goal was self-government. In 1937 he implemented reforms that increased the planning and budgetary capacity of the Secretariat, and introduced district-level planning teams working with the District Commissioners. All these changes had little time to show results when World War II (1939‚Äì1945) began. In mid-1940 Sir Philip was transferred to Nairobi to co-ordinate the East African war effort. In January 1941 he was appointed Chief Political Officer to General Sir Archibald Wavell, the Commander in Chief Middle East. He was given the delicate job of administering the Italian African colonies that had fallen to the British. In January 1942, as Chief Political Officer for the Commander in Chief, East Africa, Major-General Sir Philip Euen Mitchell signed a treaty with the Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. The reconquest of that country from the Italians had recently been completed. =Fiji= Mitchell became Governor of Fiji, arriving there on 21 July 1942. Mitchell was also British High Commissioner in the Western Pacific, and a large part of his job was to smooth out differences between the allied forces in the struggle with Japan. Fiji had a mixed-race population of 210,518 of whom about 100,000 were Fijians and 90,000 Indians. Although the white and Fijian people were on good terms and often intermarried, there were tensions with the large Indian population, most of whom were descendants of indentured labourers. Another issue was that, while the Fijian people were happy to belong to the British Empire, many of the Indians were in sympathy with the independence movement in India and could not be called loyal subjects. A further source of tension was that between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian community. Mitchell proposed that the islanders should be given greater power, but to his surprise found that the Fijians preferred the status quo, at least for the time being. Their reason was that they needed more time to develop experience in local government, or they would be dominated by the Indians. Mitchell nevertheless intended that Fiji should be put on course towards self- government, and wrote to the Colonial Office describing his views on how this would be achieved, and on the program for post-war reconstruction. Nothing was done about his recommendations during his term in office. Even while the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were under Japanese occupation, Mitchell was in charge of planning for the colony\`s future after the British regained control. At first, he was in favour of merging the colony with Fiji, since he felt it was too small to be viable on its own. The Colonial Office would not accept this proposal. Later he moved to the idea that the Gilbert and Ellice Islands would have to remain as a Native Territory, but wanted the islanders to be trained so they could take on their own administration as far as possible. =Kenya= Mitchell was Governor of Kenya from 11 December 1944 until 1952. In February 1952, he received Princess Elizabeth on a visit just before her father died and she ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. Death Mitchell died at the Royal Naval Hospital in Gibraltar on 11 October 1964 from heart failure, aged 74. Attitudes Talking after his retirement of the lack of planning in the early days in East Africa, Mitchell said \\"there was no colonial policy, for Secretaries of State changed every eighteen months or so; so no one ever disciplined a Governor and no Secretary of State would ever force a row with settlers\\". However, Mitchell had a paternalistic attitude towards Africans, considering that they needed help from white settlers to become civilised. In The Agrarian Problem in Kenya he said of Africans: \\"They are a people who, however much natural ability and however admirable attributes they may possess, are without a history, culture or religion of their own and in that they are, as far as I know, unique in the modern world.\\" Once progressive, by 1947 Mitchell had become highly conservative. In May that year he wrote to Arthur Creech Jones, Secretary of State for the Colonies, saying Britain's task was \\"to civilise a great mass of human beings who are at present in a very primitive moral, cultural and social state\\".

He was Chichele Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford, 1946‚Äì1950. He was noted for his conservative interpretation of the past, showing an empire-oriented ideology in defence of hierarchical authority, paternalism, deference, the monarchy, Church, family, nation, status, and place. Early life and education He was born at Elms House, Leatherhead, the son of stockbroker Ernest Feiling and Joan Barbara (n√©e Hawkins). His mother was the sister of novelist Sir Anthony Hope and a first cousin of Kenneth Grahame, who wrote the classic The Wind in the Willows. Keith was educated at Marlborough College, Marlborough, Wiltshire, and Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated with first-class honours in Modern History in 1906.Oxford University Calendar 1913, p. 160 In 1907, he was appointed lecturer in history at the University of Toronto under Professor George MacKinnon Wrong. Two years later, he returned to Christ Church, Oxford to lecture and resume his studies toward a doctorate. When the First World War began, he was commissioned into the Royal Highlanders. In 1916, he was posted to India and served in Jhansi and Dalhousie. From 1917 to 1919, he worked as secretary to the Central Recruiting Board of India. Academic career Following the war, Feiling returned to Oxford to teach and research. He was chairman of the Board of Modern History during 1922 to 1924, lecturer in Modern History from 1928 until 1936, and Ford's Lecturer in English History, 1931 to 1932. He also founded the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1924. He was Chichele Professor of Modern History at All Souls College, Oxford between 1946 and 1950, after which he retired and became Professor Emeritus. During this time, he also published a number of works. A Tory Democrat, he felt that conservatives possessed more character than other people, as he tried to demonstrate in his books on the history of the Conservative Party. He acknowledged the necessity of reform‚Äîas long as it was gradual, top-down, and grounded not in abstract theory but in an appreciation of English history. Thus he celebrated the reforms of the 1830s.Soffer (2009) English historian A.J.P. Taylor in 1950 praised Feiling's historiography, calling it \\"Toryism\\" in contrast to the more common \\"Whig history\\", or liberal historiography, written to show the inevitable progress of mankind. Taylor explains, \\"Toryism rests on doubt in human nature; it distrusts improvement, clings to traditional institutions, prefers the past to the future. It is a sentiment rather than a principle.\\"A.J.P. Taylor, Essays in English history (1976) p 18 Honours He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours for his work during the First World War. He was awarded the James Tait Black Award for his biography of Warren Hastings in 1954 and was knighted in the 1958 Birthday Honours. For Feiling's 80th birthday in 1964, Hugh Trevor-Roper edited a festschrift, Essays in British history presented to Sir Keith Feiling with a foreword by Lord David Cecil. Personal life In December 1912, he married Caroline (n√©e Janson), with whom he had two daughters and one son. He died in a nursing home in Putney, London, aged 93.

For about a month in June and July, a concert is held most evenings; tickets for each night are sold separately, with varying lineups and pricing. Acts have represented many genres of popular music, including rock, folk, electronic, hip hop, rhythm and blues, and country; as well as stand-up comedy acts. The first season was part of Cork's 2005 year as European Capital of Culture. It proved successful enough to be repeated annually. The venue for the first two years was the Cork Showgrounds, then owned by the Munster Agricultural Society. When the Showgrounds were acquired by the Munster GAA for its redevelopment of the adjoining P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh stadium, Live at the Marquee moved to an adjacent site previously used by Ford as a vehicle distribution centre. In 2018 National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), which had acquired the site after the 2008 economic crash, announced that it would be selling it. Aiken Promotions said it would seek an alternative site for further seasons of Live at the Marquee. It has attracted many well-known names in the music industry to perform including Little Mix, Elton John, JLS, Ellie Goulding, 50 Cent, Diana Ross, Bob Dylan, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, The Script, Pink, Christy Moore, Jason Derulo, Eric Clapton, Flo Rida, Jay-Z, Morrissey, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Anastacia, Jessie J, Olly Murs, Steps, Meat Loaf, Ke$ha, Picture This, Jedward, Ne-yo, Snoop Dogg, Lana Del Rey, Alexandra Burke and Sting.

He is the maternal grandfather of mathematicians Yakov Sinai and Grigory Barenblatt. Biography Kagan was born in Shavli, in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now ≈†iauliai, Lithuania) in 1869, to a poor Lithuanian Jewish family. In 1871 his family moved to Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro), where he grew up. Kagan entered the Imperial Novorossiya University in Odessa in 1887, but was expelled for revolutionary activities in 1889. He was put on probation and sent back to Yekaterinoslav. He studied mathematics on his own and in 1892 passed the state exam at Kiev University. In 1894 Kagan moved to St Petersburg where he continued his studies with Andrey Markov and Konstantin Posse. They tried to help him to obtain an academic position, but Kagan's Jewish background was an obstacle. Only in 1897 was he allowed to become a dozent at the Imperial Novorossiya University, where he continued to work until 1923. His students in the theory of relativity class he taught in 1921-22 included Nikolaj Papaleksi, Alexander Frumkin and Igor Tamm. Kagan worked at Moscow State University where he held the Geometry Chair from 1923 till 1952. In 1924 he joined Otto Schmidt in drawing up plans for the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Mathematical work He published over 100 mathematical papers in different parts of geometry, particularly on hyperbolic geometry and on Riemannian geometry. He received the USSR State Prize in 1943. He founded the science publisher Mathesis in Odessa. He was a director of the mathematics and natural sciences department of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia.

They were known for their metalcore sound as well as for their straight edge, vegan and anti-government ideas. The band was a \\"sister band\\" to Culture, often switching members after one had left the other. Several members went on to play in other bands such as As Friends Rust and Dead Blue Sky. The band was originally from Cooper City, Florida, but moved to Fort Lauderdale in 1998. History John Wylie who had left Culture earlier that year wanted a band with more intense and personal views. In December 1995, Morning Again was formed with Damien Moyal and Louie Long who had both been in Culture in the two prior years, on vocals and drums. Mike Wahls came in on second guitar, and Eric Ervin on bass. The band recorded an EP's worth of material which was sent to Conquer the World Records as it had released Born of You and the members were familiar with it. The label agreed to put it out, and the band made some promo tapes to help promote the upcoming release. Soon after the mini-album came out, Intention Records, who had also worked with Culture on their split with Roosevelt, asked John to release a 7\\" of new material. After landing a deal with the then-new label Good Life Recordings (as the first American band on the label) in Belgium (H8000 area), a compilation of all the released material was compiled for the European market. Tensions between Moyal and Wylie once again surfaced, as they had in Culture. During one of the last shows with Moyal, Morning Again played with Ohio band Outcast. Byers and Wylie were getting along well and he was asked to replace Moyal. Within a week Byers had moved to Cooper City and was the new vocalist. During this time Ervin was also replaced by Peter Bartsocas (who was in Bird of Ill Omen, a band that had toured with MA early that year, and was on Wylie's record label). Immediately they started working on new songs, which would be released on a split with Shoulder on Moo Cow Records. Wahls and Bartsocas left almost immediately after, and Jerry Villarroel became the first stable bassist. They released another 7\\", as a four piece, on Immigrant Sun Records, My Statement of Life in a Dying World. Joe Simmons would come in as second guitarist and would help to write most songs on the sophomore Good Life release, Martyr. Matt Thomas came in to replace Long and the band gained attention of Revelation Records who quickly signed them. As Tradition Dies Slowly was released on Revelation in 1998.Morning Again biography at Allmusic They released their final record for Good Life, a split with 25 Ta Life, and went back to Europe to tour. The group ultimately decided on breaking up by the end of the tour in the fall of 1998, partially as a result of Wylie's growing interest in pursuing Eulogy Recordings. Their final release was To Die a Bitter Death on Immigrant Sun. In 2000, Wylie's own label released a compilation of both Immigrant Sun Records 7\\"s as The Fallen... The Few That Remain. =Reunions= The band has since done multiple reunion shows. The first was in 2000, where they played under the name \\"The Cleanest War\\", which featured Damien Moyal back on vocals as well as the original line- up. The second was under the name \\"Hand of Hope\\" in 2002, where they had merchandise made specially for the show in Orlando, Florida. In 2003, a compilation of Hand of Hope and Martyr, Hand of the Martyr, was released by Eulogy Recordings. The line up for that show was Moyal on vocals, Wylie on guitar, Ervin on bass and Wes Keely on drums. On April 22, 2011 they performed at the Groezrock festival in Belgium, with Kevin Byers on vocals. For this show they also had unique merchandise made. In 2014 they played at the Belgian hardcore festival Ieperfest in the H8000 area. Moyal was also on vocals during this show. In 2015 they toured Japan and played some shows in the States, including This is Hardcore in Philadelphia, PA.

Wall  History  Lawrence Station was established by the Massachusetts State Board of Health, based on the earlier work of scientists William Thompson Sedgwick and Theobald Smith who understood the linkage of water-borne germs to specific diseases. In 1886 the Massachusetts legislature required its Board of Health to adopt water pollution standards, which led to creation of the station under the direction of Hiram Francis Mills, the \\"Father of American Sanitary Engineering\\". MIT professors William Ripley Nichols, Ellen Swallow Richards, and Thomas Messinger Drown also played important early roles. Allen Hazen and George W. Fuller were in charge of some of the earliest research on sewage treatment and drinking water filtration.EPIDEMICS, DEMONSTRATION EFFECTS, AND MUNICIPAL INVESTMENT IN SANITATION CAPITAL At first, the station's main mission was to develop practical methods for treating wastewater. Its task as to determine the effect of filtration as compared to natural oxidation, which it decided by experiments in its chemistry laboratory. During this time, Sedgwick and students invented techniques for identifying and quantitatively analyzing the microorganisms in water and sewage. These studies helped set the standards in Massachusetts, other states, and other countries. A bacteriological laboratory was added two years later. In 1893 when a typhoid epidemic (Salmonella typhi) arose along the Merrimack River, the City of Lawrence began filtration of river water using Mills' slow sand filters, thus becoming the first American city to filter its water for disease prevention. This filtering led to marked reductions in typhoid fever rate and overall death rate in the city.

It consists of a central National Police Directorate, seven specialty agencies and twelve police districts. The government agency is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and has 16,000 employees, of which 8,000 are police officers. In addition to police powers, the service is responsible for border control, certain civil duties, coordinating search and rescue operations, counter-terrorism, highway patrolling, writ of execution, criminal investigation and prosecution. The police service dates to the 13th century when the first sheriffs were appointed. As the first city in Norway to do so, Trondheim had a chief of police appointed in 1686, and Oslo established a uniformed police corps in 1859. The directorate is led by National Police Commissioner Odd Reidar Humleg√•rd. Police districts were introduced in 1894, with the current structure dating from 2003. Each police district is led by a chief of police and is subdivided into several police stations in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas. The Governor of Svalbard acts as chief of police for Svalbard. Norwegian police officers do not carry firearms, but keep their Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 pistols locked down in the patrol cars. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is partially integrated with the police. Specialist agencies within the services include the National Criminal Investigation Service, the National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (√òkokrim), the National Police Immigration Service, the National Mobile Police Service, the Norwegian Border Commissioner, the National Police Computing and Material Service and the Norwegian Police University College. Several other national responsibilities are under the command of Oslo Police District, such as the police tactical unit Delta and the two police helicopters. The Police Security Service is separate from the National Police Directorate. History The police force in Norway was established during the 13th century. Originally the 60 to 80 sheriffs (lensmann) were predominantly used for writ of execution and to a less degree police power. In the cities the duties were originally taken care of by a gjaldker. The sheriffs were originally subordinate to the sysselmann, but from the 14th century they instead became subordinate to the bailiff (fogd) and the number of sheriffs increased. In the cities the police authority was transferred directly to the bailiff. By the mid-17th century there were between 300 and 350 sheriffs. With the introduction of the absolute monarchy in 1660 and subsequent strengthening of the civil service, the importance of the police increased. The bailiffs as such became part of the police structure, with their superiors, the county governor, receiving a similar role as that of chief of police. The first titled chief of police was hired in Trondheim in 1686, thus creating the first police district, although his jurisdiction only covered the city proper. Chiefs of police were hired in Bergen in 1692, Christiania (Oslo) in 1744 and Christianssand in 1776. Norwegian police constables in 1908 From the 19th century, deputies were hired in larger areas to assist the sheriffs. Following the democratization in 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary responsibility for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large increase in the number of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889. In 1894 the authorities decided to abolish the position of bailiff and it was decided that some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters‚Äîin civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors. Minister of Justice and the Police Knut Storberget (middle) and Oslo Chief of Police Anstein Gjengedal (right) in 2008 The police school was established in 1920 and the Governor of Svalbard was created in 1925. To increase the police force's flexibility, the municipal funding was cut and replaced with state funding in 1937. That year also saw the first two specialty agencies were created, the Police Surveillance Agency (later the Police Security Service) and the Mobile Police Service. After a border agreement was reached between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1949, the Norwegian Border Commission was established the following year. The Criminal Investigation Service was established in 1959, and the search and rescue system with two joint coordination centers and sub-centers for each police district was created in 1970. The number of police districts was nearly constant from 1894 to 2002, although a few have been creased and closed. However, the organization in the various police districts varied considerably, especially in the cities. In particular, some cities had their civilian responsibilities taken care of by the municipality. This was confusing for the public, resulting in the police services reorganizing to a homogenous organization during the 1980s, whereby the civil tasks being organized as part of the police stations. √òkokrim was established in 1988 and in 1994 the administrative responsibilities for the sheriff's offices was transferred to police districts. Only once has the order to shoot to kill been issued, during the Torp hostage crisis in 1994. The police school became a university college in 1993 and introduced a three-year education; in 1998 a second campus opened in Bod√∏. Police Reform 2000 was a major restructuring of the police force. First the National Police Directorate was created in 2001,National Police Directorate (2010): 7 and from 2003 the number of police districts were reduced from 54 to 27. The Police Computing and Material Service and the Criminal Investigation Service were both established in 2004. Ten police officers have been killed in service since 1945. The Gj√∏rv Report following the 2011 Norway attacks criticized several aspects of the police force, labeling the work as \\"unacceptable\\". National Commissioner √òystein M√¶land withdrew following the criticism, in part because an internal report of the attacks had not found any criticism of the police force. Structure Head offices of the National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway in Oslo The National Police Directorate, located in Downtown Oslo, is the central administration for the Norwegian Police Service. It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate is led by the National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar Humleg√•rd. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol.National Police Directorate (2010): 15 The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime is responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases.National Police Directorate (2010): 16 The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected.National Police Directorate (2010): 17 The National Mobile Police Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country.

Their jurisdiction border goes at the 65th parallel north (Nord-Tr√∏ndelag‚ÄìNordland border). Organizationally they are directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, although their operations are subordinate to the chiefs of police in Salten and Rogaland, respectively. The Police Security Service is Norway's security agency; although considered a law enforcement agency, it is not subordinate to the National Police Directorate nor part of the Norwegian Police Service.National Police Directorate (2010): 5 Metropolitan Norway is divided into 27 police districts. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each police district is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a chief of police. Police districts hold a common pool of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an emergency call center for 112. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated in the smaller districts.National Police Directorate (2010): 8 The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000 to Eastern Finnmark which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.

It is responsible for the two police helicopters, which is mostly used for traffic motoring, search and rescue and apprehension. The tactical unit Delta is for terrorism, sabotage and hostage incidents, which is separate from the crisis and hostage negotiation service. Oslo's dog patrol service includes the national bomb squad. The departments further has a mobile deployment squad against demonstrations and riots, a Police Negotiation Unit for use against barricades and kidnapping, a mounted police, and the responsibility for protecting high-ranking government and royal officials.National Police Directorate (2010): 13 Svalbard is not part of the regular police districts‚Äîinstead it law enforcement it handled by the Governor of Svalbard. He holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch.

Jan Mayen is subordinate to Salten Police District. Jurisdiction and capabilities The National Mobile Police Service performing a traffic control on E18 Norway has a unified police, which means that there is a single police organization and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack. Responsibilities and functions related to security includes patrolling, continual emergency availability, highway patrolling, sea patrolling, coordination of search and rescue activities, embassy security and as a body guard service for members of the government, the royal family and other in need. The crime fighting responsibility is split between preventative measures, such as information, observation and controls, and consequential measures, such as investigation and prosecution. The police further have duties related to civilian court cases, such as writ of execution, evaluation of natural damage, assisting the courts after bankruptcies and functioning as a notary public. Romerike Police District is responsible for the passport control at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen The police have a series of functions related to public management, such as the issuing of passports, firearms licenses, police certificates, permissions for lotteries and withdrawal of driving licenses, approval of security guard companies and bouncers, recommendations to municipal councils for issuing alcohol sales licenses, approval of second-hand shops and arrangements which are otherwise unlawful, dealing with unowned dogs and animals in the care of people sentenced unsuitable to hold animals. The police also have the responsibility for prisoner transport during detention, including transport to and from court. The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the Schengen Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees‚Äîall other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which is the responsibility of the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of international police cooperation, such as Interpol, Europol, the Schengen Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations. In 2011 the police force had 746,464 assignments, the most common with 180,000 assignments being investigation cases, such as reported deaths, controls and reports of motor vehicle theft. This was followed by traffic assignments, public disturbance of peace, animal cases, theft, private disturbance of peace, and sickness and psychiatry. Seventy-five percent of assignments are solved with a single patrol, while ninety percent are solved with one and two. In armed situations only twenty percent are solved with a single patrol. In 2010 the Norwegian Police Service had 13 billion Norwegian krone in costs, of which seventy percent was used on wages. It employed 13,493 man-years, or 1.6 man-years per 1000 residents. There were 394,137 reported offenses, or 81.1 per 1000 people, of which 46 percent were solved. There were 5,399 debt settlements, 226,491 applications for writ of execution, 195,345 immigration cases and 4,615 forced returns. Investigation and prosecution A police student demonstrates securing DNA evidence. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is integrated into the Norwegian Police Service. The authority is divided into a higher and lower authority, with the higher authority (public prosecutor) being a separate government agency and the lower authority (police prosecutor) being members of the police. The latter includes chief of police, deputy chief of police, police prosecutors and deputy police prosecutors. In questions of prosecution the police districts are subordinate to the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority and in other matters subordinate to the National Police Directorate. The higher authorities will take decisions in serious criminal charges and for appeals. The Norwegian Persecuting Authority is led by the Director General of Public Prosecutions,National Police Directorate (2010): 29 which since 1997 has been Tor-Aksel Busch. The director general makes decisions of indictment in cases with a maximum penalty of twenty-one years and certain other serious crimes. There are twelve subordinate agencies, ten regional and two supporting Kripos and √òkokrim, respectively. The regional public prosecution offices take decisions regarding cases not covered by the director general or the police prosecutors. If an offense is filed, the issue may be investigated by police on duty. Permission for search and seizure is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. Investigations are led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, the case may be concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.National Police Directorate (2010): 31‚Äì33 Criminal cases with an assumed perpetrator are sent to the public prosecutor, who will consider issuing an indictment. If positive, the trial will take place at a district court, with a police prosecutor presiding over the case. Cases with more than six years maximum penalty will normally be carried out with public prosecutors prosecuting. Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway. Education and employment Education of police officers is the responsibility of the Norwegian Police University College, which is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. The main campus is located at Majorstuen in Oslo, while the secondary campus is located at M√∏rkved in Bod√∏. In addition the college has training centers in Kongsvinger and Stavern. Police officer training is a three-year bachelor's degree, where the first and third year take place at the college and the second year is on- the-ground training in police districts. In 2009, 1990 people applied for 432 places at the college. From 2010, admission is administrated through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. The college also has a three-year part-time master's degree in police science. As the chief of police and deputy chief of police are part of the prosecuting authority, they must be a candidate of law to act in such a position. Although there no longer is a formal requirement for such an education, the role as prosecutor effectively hinders others from holding the position. At the time of graduation all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main reason is that the police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel. Each police district may dictate that operational personnel have a higher amount of training, for instance 80 hours is required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each police district, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the tactical unit Delta (73 officers). All certification curriculum is developed by and organized by the university college. One of Oslo Police District's two Eurocopter EC135 The Norwegian Police Federation is the trade union which organizes employees from all levels within the police force. The federation is a member of the Confederation of Unions for Professionals, Norway and the European Confederation of Police. It is illegal for police officers to strike. The federation have nonetheless undertaken several actions, including collective sick leave to close a police station and by members sabotaging courses by not participating. Reports of misconduct and criminal offenses by officers during duty is investigated by the Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs. Based in Hamar, it is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police and is not part of the Norwegian Police Service. Equipment As of 2011 the police's new patrol cars are four-wheel drive Volkswagen Passat with automatic transmission. New transport cars are Mercedes-Benz Vito for light transport and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for heavy transport. The police force operates two Eurocopter EC135 and two AW169 helicopters, which are based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In addition, Delta can use the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Bell 412 helicopters. Police officer armed with a Heckler & Koch MP5. The police have two main types of uniforms, type I is used for personnel which primarily undertake indoor work, and type II is used for personnel which primarily undertakes outdoor service. Both types have summer and winter versions, and type I also has a dress uniform version. Both types use black as the dominant color with light blue shirts. Police officers are not armed with firearms during patrolling, but have weapons locked down in the patrol cars. Arming of the locked-down weapons requires permission from the chief of police or someone designated by him. The police use Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 semi- automatic pistols. Delta uses Diemaco C8 assault rifles. Norwegian police officers use electroshock weapons called Taser X2 and they started using it in 2018. Previously the police used a decentralized information technology system developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel have access to the system via thin clients. The police have a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online. The Norwegian Public Safety Radio has been installed in Oslo, √òstfold, Akershus and southern Buskerud. The system is uses Terrestrial Trunked Radio and allows for a common public safety network for all emergency agencies. Features include authentication, encryption and possibilities to transmit data traffic. As the system is rolled out, central parts will receive transmission speeds of 163 kbit/s. The rest of the country uses an analog radio system specific for each police district. In addition to lack of interoperability with paramedics and fire fighters, none of the systems are encrypted, forcing police officers to rely heavily on GSM-based mobile telephones for dispatch communication when transmitting sensitive information. Police cars lack GPS navigation devices and mobile data terminal. Instead, all communication must be radioed to the dispatcher at the joint operations center, and officers must rely on printed road atlases for navigation. In contrast, GPS navigation and terminal equipment was finished installed in ambulances and fire trucks in 2003. The Norwegian Public Safety Radio is scheduled for completion in 2015. It was reported in November of 2018 that the Norweigian Police had adopted the SIG Sauer P320 X-series 9mm handgun as their new service pistol. https://www.all4shooters.com/en/shooting/pistols/sig-sauer-p320-x-series-for- the-norwegian-police/ https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2018/11/9/sig- sauer-p320-x-series-new-sidearm-for-norwegian-police/  RanksNorwegian National Police  {style=\\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\\" +Police ranks of Norway - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background: #E0E0E0\\" !

For example, after the release of The Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll, who was kidnapped in Iraq, McGuirk stated: \\"She strikes me as the kind of woman who would wear one of those suicide vests. You know, walk into the tent or try and sneak into the Green Zone. =Cardinals O'Connor and Egan= The son of Irish immigrants and an altar boy in his youth, McGuirk has done impersonations of John Cardinal O'Connor and Edward Cardinal Egan (both Archbishops of New York) in which he \\"fashions an oversize FedEx envelope into a cone on his head ... Using a high-pitched Irish brogue ... the producer-as-cardinal said on the March 16 installment of the show that 'the only thing Hillary Clinton has in common with the late great President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, God rest his soul, is that they both enjoyed extramarital affairs with women.'\\" =U.S. President Barack Obama= Regarding Presidential aspirant Barack Obama, McGuirk stated: \\"He's a neophyte, no experience. It's all because he's half black, it's patronizing, he's Oprah's guy.\\" After Imus tried to interrupt him, McGuirk went on again to say it was patronizing to support Obama, and referred to him as a \\"jug-eared neophyte\\". =Satanist controversy= On January 9, 2014, during a debate on Imus in the Morning about a group erecting a statue of Satan next to a sign of the Ten Commandments, McGuirk advocated that \\"They should be able to put the statue up, and then they should be shot right next to it, and then we take it down.\\"\\"FBN Guest: Satanists 'Should Be Shot' Next to Statue They Wish to Erect in Oklahoma\\", Mediaite.com, January 9, 2014. McGuirk subsequently apologized, claiming that his comments were \\"rooted in ignorance\\". =Rutgers basketball controversy= McGuirk played a role in an on-air incident on April 4, 2007 that caused a nationwide controversy and ultimately led to both him and Imus being fired. During a discussion of the Rutgers University women's basketball team, Imus characterized the players as \\"rough girls with tattoos.\\" McGuirk responded in his familiar \\"urban-speak\\" vernacular by referring to them as \\"hardcore hos\\". The ensuing \\"urban-speak\\" conversation involved Imus describing the girls as \\"nappy-headed hos\\" and McGuirk wondering if Imus meant to imply that the two teams looked like something out of Spike Lee's film School Daze, the \\"jigaboos versus the wannabes\\"; apparently referring to the two teams' differing appearances. Imus said \\"Yeah.\\" On April 11, 2007, MSNBC announced that it would immediately stop simulcasting the show. Originally, both CBS and MSNBC had announced a two-week suspension of the program. The next day, CBS fired Imus and canceled Imus in the Morning, effective immediately. CBS President and Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves stated: > From the outset, I believe all of us have been deeply upset and revulsed by > the statements that were made on our air about the young women who > represented Rutgers University in the NCAA Women's Basketball Championship > with such class, energy and talent. There has been much discussion of the > effect language like this has on our young people, particularly young women > of color trying to make their way in this society. That consideration has > weighed most heavily on our minds as we made our decision.\\"Newly fired Imus > meets with Rutgers players\\" , CNN.com, April 13, 2007.\\"CBS fires Don Imus > from radio show\\", MSNBC.com, April 13, 2007. The day before, CBS chairman Sumner Redstone said he trusted Moonves would \\"do the right thing\\", but didn't elaborate. McGuirk was noticeably absent the following week when other Imus contributors, including newsman Charles McCord and sportscaster Chris Carlin, were on the air with the WFAN replacement team of Mike Francesa and Chris \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo. McGuirk was fired by WFAN on April 19, 2007.\\"Imus sidekick-producer McGuirk also fired\\", MSNBC.com, April 20, 2007. Post-firing On April 26, 2007, McGuirk appeared on the Fox News Channel program Hannity & Colmes to discuss his dismissal. On May 14, 2007, he reappeared on the program to debate Al Sharpton on the events that led to the cancellation of the Imus in the Morning program.\\"The Great Debate! Bernard McGuirk vs. Rev. Al Sharpton\\", FOXNews.com, May 14, 2007. On May 2, 2007, McGuirk made a guest appearance on Jay Severin's radio program. Although there was some speculation in the media that the sometimes controversial station might be auditioning McGuirk for a job, executives of WTKK denied that this was the case. Boston talk radio station WRKO had scheduled McGuirk to appear as a co-host with Thomas Finneran from May 23, 2007 to May 25, 2007, but canceled the appearance reportedly due to public criticism.\\"Radio Station May Hire Ex-Imus Sidekick Bernard McGuirk\\", FOXNews.com, May 18, 2007.\\"WRKO cancels appearance by McGuirk\\", The Boston Globe, May 21, 2007. McGuirk was also a weekly guest on The O'Reilly Factor, appearing on the segment What the Heck Just Happened? with Greg Gutfeld. =Return to WABC= McGuirk returned to the airwaves with Imus on December 3, 2007. Along with serving as the executive producer, he also had an on-air role. The program was heard on WABC in New York as well being carried on stations owned by or affiliated with the ABC Radio Network, and Fox Business Network simulcasted the program. McGuirk was one of the several people who rotated hosting of the post-Imus midday slot in from May to October 2010 on WABC, a job that eventually went to Joe Crummey. In early 2016, McGuirk partnered with Sid Rosenberg to host a morning radio talk show on WABC, called \\"The Bernie and Sid Show\\", which became the replacement show when Don Imus retired on March 29, 2018.

Tucker, MD- University of Virginia profile He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his wife, Christine McDowell Tucker, a clinical psychologist, and has presented at academic and public conferences.The Unexplained - San Francisco Conference on proof of afterlife Tucker felt unfulfilled by his work in child psychiatry, but was open to the possibility that humans are more than their material bodies and wished to investigate the matter further. Though raised as a Southern Baptist, Tucker does not subscribe to any particular religion, and claims to be skeptical about reincarnation, but sees it as providing the best explanation for phenomena associated with the strongest cases investigated to date. After reading Ian Stevenson's work, Tucker became intrigued by children's reported past-life memories and by the prospect of studying them.  Reincarnation research  While Ian Stevenson focused on cases in Asia, Tucker has studied U.S. children.Miller, Lisa (Sunday, August 29, 2010). \\"Remembrances of Lives Past.\\" New York Times Tucker reports that in about 70% of the cases of children claiming to remember past lives, the deceased died from an unnatural cause, suggesting that traumatic death may be linked to the hypothesized survival of self. He further indicates that the time between death and apparent rebirth is, on average, sixteen months, and that unusual birth-marks might match fatal wounds suffered by the deceased.Coast to Coast AM Tucker explained that individual cases are investigated and checked for accuracy. For instance, birth-marks of an unusual shape or size might match fatal wounds that the deceased had. Tucker has developed the Strength Of Case Scale (S.O.C.S.), which evaluates what Tucker sees as four aspects of potential cases of reincarnation;Tucker, Jim (2000), ‚ÄòA scale to measure the strength and weakness of children‚Äôs claims of previous lives: Methodology and initial findings‚Äô, Journal of Scientific Exploration, 14 (4), pp 571‚Äì81.Mills, Antonia. ‚ÄòBack from Death: Young Adults in Northern India Who as Children Were Said to Remember a Previous Life, with or without a Shift in Religion (Hindu to Moslem or Vice Versa)‚Äô, in Anthropology and Humanism, Volume 31.

Setting Criteria for Ideal Reincarnation Research Journal of Consciousness Studies, 14, No. 12, 2007, pp. 92‚Äì101 Although critics have argued there is no material explanation for the survival of self, Tucker suggests that quantum mechanics may offer a mechanism by which memories and emotions could carry over from one life to another. He argues that since the act of observation collapses wave equations, the self may not be merely a by-product of the brain, but rather a separate entity that impinges on matter. Tucker argues that viewing the self as a fundamental, nonmaterial part of the universe makes it possible to conceive of it continuing to exist after the death of the brain.Tucker JB. Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives New York: St. Martin's Press, 2005, 256pp. He provides the analogy of a television and the television transmission; the television is required to decode the signal, but it does not create the signal. In a similar way, the brain may be required for awareness to express itself, but may not be the source of awareness.  Media coverage  Since taking over the research into claimed past-life memories from Ian Stevenson in 2002, Tucker has been interviewed about reincarnation in print and broadcast media in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. In 2006, Tucker investigated the case of Cameron Macaulay as part of the Channel 5 Documentary Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Lived Before. Tucker's investigation took him firstly to Glasgow to interview the six-year-old boy and his mother Norma about Cameron's reported recollections of life on the isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, around two hundred miles from the family's home in Glasgow. Tucker then accompanied the family as they traveled to Barra in an attempt to verify Cameron's statements about life on the island. Cameron's descriptions of his previous family home were entirely accurate; while the family name of \\"Robertson\\" also rang true, nothing could be found of the man Cameron recalled as his father on the island. The documentary also briefly covered another of Tucker's cases: that of Gus Taylor from the Midwest U.S., who claimed from around the age of a year and a half to be his own grandfather returned to the family. In addition to speaking of a previous life, Tucker notes that both boys speak of falling through a 'hole' or ‚Äòporthole‚Äô from one life to the next. In 2009, he was interviewed on Larry King Live about the cases he has studied.

As a result of the 17th to 19th century Russian conquest of Siberia and the subsequent population movements during the Soviet era, the demographics of Siberia today is dominated by native speakers of Russian. There remain a considerable number of indigenous groups, between them accounting for below 10% of total Siberian population (about 4,500,000), some of which are distantly genetically related to indigenous peoples of the Americas. History Ethnographic map of the 16th-century Siberia from a Russian Empire period encyclopedia Koryak men at the ceremony of starting the New Fire In Kamchatka the Itelmens' uprisings against Russian rule in 1706, 1731, and 1741, were crushed. During the first uprising the Itelmen were armed with only stone weapons, but in later uprisings they used gunpowder weapons. The Russian Cossacks faced tougher resistance from the Koryaks, who revolted with bows and guns from 1745 to 1756, and were even forced to give up in their attempts to wipe out the Chukchi in 1729, 1730‚Äì1, and 1744‚Äì7. After the Russian defeat in 1729 at Chukchi hands, the Russian commander Major Dmitry Pavlutsky was responsible for the Russian war against the Chukchi and the mass slaughters and enslavement of Chukchi women and children in 1730‚Äì31, but his cruelty only made the Chukchis fight more fiercely.Forsyth 1994, pp. 145-6. A war against the Chukchis and Koryaks was ordered by Empress Elizabeth in 1742 to totally expel them from their native lands and erase their culture through war. The command was that the natives be \\"totally extirpated\\" with Pavlutskiy leading again in this war from 1744 to 1747 in which he led to the Cossacks \\"with the help of Almighty God and to the good fortune of Her Imperial Highness\\", to slaughter the Chukchi men and enslave their women and children as booty. However this phase of the war came to an inconclusive end, when the Chukchi forced them to give up by killing Pavlutskiy and decapitating him.Forsyth 1994, p. 146. The Russians were also launching wars and slaughters against the Koryaks in 1744 and 1753‚Äì4. After the Russians tried to force the natives to convert to Christianity, the different native peoples like the Koryaks, Chukchis, Itelmens, and Yukaghirs all united to drive the Russians out of their land in the 1740s, culminating in the assault on Nizhnekamchatsk fort in 1746.Forsyth 1994, p. 147. Kamchatka today is European in demographics and culture with only 2.5% of it being native, around 10,000 from a previous number of 150,000, due to infectious diseases, such as smallpox, mass suicide and the mass slaughters by the Cossacks after its annexation in 1697 of the Itelmen and Koryaks throughout the first decades of Russian rule.Jack 2008, p. 388. The genocide by the Russian Cossacks devastated the native peoples of Kamchatka and exterminated much of their population.\\"Cond√© Nast's Traveler, Volume 36\\" 2001, p. 280.\\"Yearbook\\" 1992, p. 46. In addition to committing genocide the Cossacks also devastated the wildlife by slaughtering massive numbers of animals for fur.Mote 1998, p. 44. 90% of the Kamchadals and half of the Vogules were killed from the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries and the rapid genocide of the indigenous population led to entire ethnic groups being entirely wiped out, with around 12 exterminated groups which could be named by Nikolai Iadrintsev as of 1882. Much of the slaughter was brought on by the fur trade.Etkind 2013, p. 78. President of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Yegor Borisov in 2010 In the 17th century, indigenous peoples of the Amur region were attacked and colonized by Russians who came to be known as \\"red- beards\\".Stephan 1996, p. 64. The Russian Cossacks were named luocha (ÁæÖÂâé), rakshasa by Amur natives, after demons found in Buddhist mythology. They feared the invaders as they ruthlessly colonized the Amur tribes, invaders who were subjects of the Qing dynasty during the Sino‚ÄìRussian border conflicts. Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu is of Tuvan descent The regionalist oblastniki was, in the 19th century, among the Russians in Siberia who acknowledged that the natives were subjected to violence of almost genocidal proportions by the Russian colonization. They claimed that they would rectify the situation with their proposed regionalist policies. The colonizers used slaughter, alcoholism and disease to bring the natives under their control, some small nomadic groups essentially disappeared, and much of the evidence of their obliteration has itself been destroyed, with only a few artifacts documenting their presence remaining in Russian museums and collections. In 1918-1921 there was a violent revolutionary upheaval in Siberia. Russian Cossacks under Captain Grigori Semionov established themselves as warlords by crushing the indigenous peoples who resisted colonization. The Russian colonization of Siberia and conquest of its indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization in the United States and its natives, with similar negative impacts on the natives and the appropriation of their land. However Siberian experience was very different, as settlement was not resulted to dramatic native depopulation. The Slavic Russians outnumber all of the native peoples in Siberia and its cities except in Tuva and Sakha (where the Tuvans and Yakuts serve as the majority ethnic groups respectively), with the Slavic Russians making up the majority in Buryatia and the Altai Republic, outnumbering the Buryat and Altaian natives. The Buryats make up only 29% of their own Republic, and Altai is only one-third, and the Chukchi, Evenks, Khanty, Mansi, and Nenets are outnumbered by non-natives by 90% of the population. The Czars and Soviets enacted policies to force natives to change their way of life, while rewarding ethnic Russians with the natives‚Äô reindeer herds and wild game they had confiscated. The reindeer herds have been mismanaged to the point of extinction.  Overview  Nenets child Painting of Chukchi couple Classifying the diverse population by language, it includes speakers of the following language families (number of speakers reflect the 2002 Russian census): * Uralic **Samoyedic (some 70,000 speakers) **Ugric (some 15,000 speakers) * Yukaghir (nearly extinct) *Turkic **Yakut (456,288 speakers) **Dolgan (population: 7,261; speakers: 4,865) **Tuvan (population: 243,442; speakers: 242,754) **Tofa (population: 837; speakers: 378) **Khakas (population: 75,622; speakers: 52,217) **Shor (population: 13,975; speakers: 6,210) **Siberian Tatar (populations: 6,779) **Chulym (population: 656; speakers: 270) **Altai (some 70,000 speakers) *Mongolic (some 400,000 speakers) * Tungusic (some 80,000 speakers) *Ob-Yeniseian **Ket (population: 1600; some 210 speakers) *Chukotko-Kamchatkan (some 25,000 speakers) *Nivkh (some 200 speakers) Simplified, the indigenous peoples of Siberia listed above can be put into four groups, # Uralic # Altaic # Yeniseian # Paleosiberian (\\"other\\") Altaic has not been proven to be a language family, a phylogenetic unit. It may be a Sprachbund. Paleosiberian is simply a geographic term of convenience. Here, these two terms are listed just to serve as portal-like starting points ‚Äì without suggesting genetic considerations. Uralic group =Khanty and Mansi= The Khanty (obsolete: Ostyaks) and Mansi (obsolete: Voguls) live in Khanty‚ÄìMansi Autonomous Okrug, a region historically known as \\"Yugra\\" in Russia. By 2013, oil and gas companies had already devastated much of the Khanty tribes' lands. In 2014 the Khanty-Mansi regional parliament continued to weaken legislation that had previously protected Khanty and Mansi communities. Tribes' permission was required before oil and gas companies could enter their land. =Samoyeds= Selkup manalt= Samoyedic peoples include: *Northern Samoyedic peoples **Nenets **Enets **Nganasan *Southern Samoyedic peoples **Selkup **Kamasins or Kamas (now extinct as a distinct ethnic group) **Mator or Motor (now extinct as a distinct ethnic group) **Koibal (now extinct as a distinct ethnic group) Yukaghir group Yukaghir is spoken in two mutually unintelligible varieties in the lower Kolyma and Indigirka valleys. Other languages, including Chuvantsy, spoken further inland and further east, are now extinct. Yukaghir is held by some to be related to the Uralic languages in the Uralic‚ÄìYukaghir family. The Yukaghirs (self- designation: –æ–¥—É–ª odul, –¥–µ—Ç–∫–∏–ª—å detkil) are people in East Siberia, living in the basin of the Kolyma River. The Tundra Yukaghirs live in the Lower Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic; the Taiga Yukaghirs in the Upper Kolyma region in the Sakha Republic and in Srednekansky District of Magadan Oblast. By the time of Russian colonization in the 17th century, the Yukaghir tribal groups (Chuvans, Khodyns, Anauls, etc.) occupied territories from the Lena River to the mouth of the Anadyr River. The number of the Yukaghirs decreased between the 17th and 19th centuries due to epidemics, internecine wars and Tsarist colonial policy. Some of the Yukaghirs have assimilated with the Yakuts, Evens, and Russians. Currently Yukaghirs live in the Sakha Republic and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. According to the 2002 Census, their total number was 1,509 people, up from 1,112 recorded in the 1989 Census. Mongolic group Buryat shaman of Olkhon, Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia The Buryats number approximately 436,000, which makes them the largest ethnic minority group in Siberia. They are mainly concentrated in their homeland, the Buryat Republic, a federal subject of Russia. They are the northernmost major Mongol group.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th Edition. (1977). Vol. II, p. 396. . Buryats share many customs with their Mongolian cousins, including nomadic herding and erecting huts for shelter. Today, the majority of Buryats live in and around Ulan Ude, the capital of the republic, although many live more traditionally in the countryside. Their language is called Buryat. Turkic group alt= The most important examples for Shamanism in Siberia are Yakuts, Dolgans and Tuvans. Most Siberian Tatars are Sunni Muslims. Members of the Shors practice Russian Orthodox Christianity, animism or shamanism. Tungusic group The Evenks live in the Evenk Autonomous Okrug of Russia. The Udege, Ulchs, Evens, and Nanai (also known as Hezhen) are also indigenous peoples of Siberia, and are known to share genetic affinity to Indigenous Peoples of the Americas. \\"Paleosiberian\\" groups Ket womanalt= Four small language families and isolates, not known to have any linguistic relationship to each other, compose the Paleo-Siberian languages: :1. The Chukotko-Kamchatkan family, sometimes known as Luoravetlan, includes Chukchi and its close relatives, Koryak, Alutor and Kerek. Itelmen, also known as Kamchadal, is also distantly related. Chukchi, Koryak and Alutor are spoken in easternmost Siberia by communities numbering in the dozens (Alutor) to thousands (Chukchi). Kerek is now extinct, and Itelmen is now spoken by fewer than 10 people, mostly elderly, on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. :2. Yukaghir is spoken in two mutually unintelligible varieties in the lower Kolyma and Indigirka valleys. Other languages, including Chuvantsy, spoken further inland and further east, are now extinct. Yukaghir is held by some to be related to the Uralic languages. :3. Ket is the last survivor of the Yeniseian family along the middle of the Yenisei River and its tributaries. It has recently been claimed to be related to the Na-Dene languages of North America, though this hypothesis has met with mixed reviews among historical linguists. In the past, attempts have been made to relate it to Sino-Tibetan, North Caucasian, and Burushaski. :4. Nivkh is spoken in the lower Amur basin and on the northern half of Sakhalin island. It has a recent modern literature and the Nivkhs have experienced a turbulent history in the last century. Relationship to Indigenous peoples of the Americas Kranoyarsk Regional Museum, Russia Paleo-Indians from modern day Siberia are thought to have crossed into the Americas across the Beringia land bridge between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago. Analysis of genetic markers has also been used to link the two groups of indigenous peoples. Studies focused on looking at markers on the Y chromosome, which is always inherited by sons from their fathers. Haplogroup Q is a unique mutation shared among most indigenous peoples of the Americas. Studies have found that 93.8% of Siberia's Ket people's and 66.4% of Siberia's Selkup people's possess the mutation. The principal-component analysis suggests a close genetic relatedness between some North American Amerindians (the Chipewyan [Ojibwe] and the Cheyenne) and certain populations of central/southern Siberia (particularly the Kets, Yakuts, Selkups, and Altaians), at the resolution of major Y-chromosome haplogroups. This pattern agrees with the distribution of mtDNA haplogroup X, which is found in North America, is absent from eastern Siberia, but is present in the Altaians of southern central Siberia.

He played representative football for both Queensland and Australia. Early life Moore grew up in Wallangarra, Queensland. He was born in Tenterfield (NSW), due to the hospital there being closer than the one in Stanthorpe (QLD). Moore was quoted as saying \\"My Mum assures me I was rushed back to the Channel Country before the oxygen had time to affect my lungs.\\" Playing career Moore represented New South Wales under-17s while in high school at Stanthorpe, Qld. He moved to the North Sydney Bears in 1989 and played in the club's reserve grade premiership side. Speaking with the media in 2019, Moore recalled his time when he first joined Norths saying \\"All this talk about the Bears being losers, I didn‚Äôt give a shit about it, I hated it, I despised the fact that we even mentioned it, because that was the legacy of the past, that wasn‚Äôt something we‚Äôd carry into the future\\". With a radical change of the guard the following year, Moore and a number of other players (including long-time back-row partner David Fairleigh) became regular first graders the following year and propelled the club from also-rans in 1989 to finalists in 1991. Although Moore damaged a jaw at the start of that year, he played superbly in the first semi-final win by the Bears for 39 years against Manly, scoring two tries. Moore was first selected in Queensland's State of Origin side in 1992. Moore was the sole try- scorer in the Maroons' 5-4 win in the second match of the series at Lang Park. Moore was a regular selection for the maroon jersey for three seasons and famously yelled 'Queenslander! Queenslander!' in an attempt to motivate an underdog Maroons team on their way out of the tunnel in 1995, even though he is technically from New South Wales (he was born just over the border in Tenterfield, but his family was living QLD).http://www.smh.com.au/rugby- league/state-of-origin/billy-moore-reveals-story-of-the-queenslander- cry-20130626-2owa0.html Moore was reacting to the fact that New South Wales players had said they would belt the first person that said he was a Queenslander. The young Queenslanders won the series 3 nil without its star Super League players. While Moore was initially overlooked for Test duty against New Zealand, he won a place in Australia's World Cup squad at the end of the year. He made one appearance in the competition, against South Africa, before playing further ARL Tests against Fiji (1996) and Rest of the World (1997) in consecutive years. He continued to play for his club in subsequent semi-final campaigns but his representative career ended when he was left out of the Queensland team for the 1998 series. At the end of 1999, Moore failed to secure a contract with the merged Northern Eagles club and reluctantly retired. As part of the South Sydney Rabbitohs push to be reinstated in first grade, Moore played for the club in promotional games to raise money and awareness and to gain support of the rugby league community for a readmission into the NRL which was ultimately successful in 2002.https://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/799633/bush-could-do-with- rabbitohs/https://www.rabbitohs.com.au/news/2018/04/20/flashback-a-day-of- celebration-on-the-central-coast/ Post playing In 2000, Moore was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. In August, 2006 he was named in the North Sydney Bears' Team of the Century.

In July 2015, Moore was forced to apologize after making derogatory comments regarding the New Zealand Warriors playing style.

There were talks of Norths buying the Gold Coast licence with the club being rebranded as the Gold Coast Bears, which would have also resulted in the creation of a new logo and the return of the famous red and black colors.

His sister Evgenia Tur was a popular novelist, critic and journalist and his sister Sofia was a painter of some note. Biography A rich aristocrat who often travelled, Sukhovo-Kobylin was arrested, prosecuted and tried for seven years in Russia for the murder of his French mistress Louise-Simone Dimanche, a crime of which he is nowadays generally believed to have been innocent. He only managed to achieve acquittal by means of giving enormous bribes to court officials and by using all of his contacts in the Russian elite. According to his own version as well as the generally accepted view today, he was targeted precisely because he had the financial capabilities to give such bribes. Based on his personal experiences, Sukhovo-Kobylin wrote a trilogy of satirical plays about the prevalence of bribery and other corrupt practices in the Russian judicial system of the time ‚Äì Krechinsky's Wedding (Russian: –°–≤–∞–¥—å–±–∞ –ö—Ä–µ—á–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ) (1850‚Äì1854, begun in prison), The Trial (alternatively titled The Case) (Russian: –î–µ–ª–æ) (1861), and Tarelkin's Death (alternatively titled Rasplyuyev's merry days) (Russian: –°–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å –¢–∞—Ä–µ–ª–∫–∏–Ω–∞, –†–∞—Å–ø–ª—é–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ—Å–µ–ª—ã–µ –¥–Ω–∏) (1869). The first work had immediate success and became one of Russia's most frequently performed plays. It is also considered Sukhovo-Kobylin's best. The trilogy in its entirety was published in 1869 under the title Scenes from the Past (Russian: –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω—ã –ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–¥—à–µ–≥–æ). Attempts to stage the last two plays ran into difficulties with censorship; in particular, Tarelkin's Death was only staged in 1899. While popular, the two sequels failed to achieve the same success as the first play. Sukhovo-Kobylin in the early 1850s.

In the latter year it was withdrawn as a national monument. It is located in southwestern Mountrail County, west of the city of New Town. It lies within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. This 101-hectare monument was established on June 29, 1917, to commemorate the explorations of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye and his sons in North Dakota and the area of the upper Missouri River. The father was a French-Canadian explorer and fur-trader intent on finding an overland water route to the Western Ocean. Between 1731 and 1737 he built several trading posts between Lake Superior and Lake Winnipeg, assisted by his four sons and a nephew. In 1738 he and son Fran√ßois travelled southwest to what is now North Dakota, arriving in December at a Mandan village a day's journey from the Missouri River. On that trip V√©rendrye established two forts, Fort Rouge and Fort La Reine, in what is now Manitoba. Other forts built to the north and west by people under his command created a large area in the west for French traders. In 1742 two of his sons (probably Louis-Joseph and Fran√ßois) made another expedition to the Missouri. Because of the difficulty of identifying places and Native American tribes in their reports, there is no certainty as to the route they took or how far they travelled, but they may have been the first European explorers to view the Rocky Mountains. This was more than 60 years before the expedition of Lewis and Clark. It was on this 1742-43 expedition that the V√©rendrye brothers were thought to have camped at Crowhigh Butte (now called Crow Flies High Butte) in North Dakota. This 565 foot high butte dominates the surrounding plains and is an ideal vantage point. In 1917 the state historical society was instrumental in getting the butte and surrounding area proclaimed a national monument. A plaque at the monument reads: > The Verendrye National Monument. Established June 29, 1917. To commemorate > discovery of this area in 1742 by the Sons of Verendrye, celebrated French > explorer. Crowhigh Mountain was used as an observation station to spy out > unknown land farther west. In 1738 the elder Verendrye and one son made a > trip to within a day's journey of the Missouri River, and were the first > white men to enter what is now North Dakota. This was in the course of a > journey from Verendrye's trading post in Manitoba, Canada, in an effort, > which was unsuccessful, to reach the western sea by an overland route. However, later opinion suggested that the site was inaccurately located. On July 30, 1956, the site was withdrawn as a national monument and transferred to the State of North Dakota. Much of the original site has since been flooded by a reservoir (Lake Sakakawea). Ironically, new research indicates that Crow Flies High Butte may indeed be the site where the Verendryes climbed to view the Little Missouri Valley in 1742.

Life and career Ives was the illegitimate son of an English army officer and a Spanish baroness. He was raised by his paternal grandmother, Emma Ives. They lived between Bentworth in Hampshire and the South of France. Ives was educated at home and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he started to amass 45 volumes of scrapbooks (between 1892 and 1949). These scrapbooks consist of clippings on topics such as murders, punishments, freaks, theories of crime and punishment, transvestism, psychology of gender, homosexuality, cricket scores, and letters he wrote to newspapers. His interest in cricket led him to play a single first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1902. Ives met Oscar Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Ives was already working for the end of the oppression of homosexuals, what he called \\"the Cause.\\" He hoped that Wilde would join \\"the Cause\\", but was disappointed. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. By 1897, Ives created and founded the Order of Chaeronea, a secret society for homosexuals which was named after the location of the battle where the Sacred Band of Thebes was finally annihilated in 338 BC. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson. The same year, Ives visited Edward Carpenter at Millthorpe. This marked the beginning of their friendship. In 1914, Ives, together with Edward Carpenter, Magnus Hirschfeld, Laurence Housman and others, founded the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. He also kept in touch with other progressive psychologists such as Havelock Ellis and Professor Cesare Lombroso. The topics addressed by the Society in lectures and publications included: the promotion of the scientific study of sex and a more rational attitude towards sexual conduct; problems and questions connected with sexual psychology (from medical, juridical, and sociological aspects), birth control, abortion, sterilisation, venereal diseases, and all aspects of prostitution. In 1931, the organisation became the British Sexological Society. Ives was the archivist for the Society whose papers are now held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Ives was a member of the Humanitarian League, a radical advocacy group, which operated between 1891 and 1919. Ives also visited prisons across Europe and specialised in the study of the penal methods, particularly that of England. He lectured and published books on the topic. He died in London but was buried in the village of Bentworth, Hampshire. The Ives papers At his death in 1950, George Ives left a large archive covering his life and work between 1874 and 1949. The papers were bought in 1977 by the Harry Ransom Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. They have been divided into four sections as follows: =I. Correspondence, 1874‚Äì1936= This section contains invitations and letters regarding Ives' writings and lectures on prison reform, sodomy, the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, and other topics. Ives' correspondents include Adolf Brand, Oscar Browning, Edward Carpenter, Havelock Ellis, Norman Gale, Augustus Hare, Ernest Jones, Cesare Lombroso, C.M. North, Reggie Turner and Edward Westermarck. =II. Works, 1897‚Äì1937= This section groups examples of Ives' published works, lectures, notes and samples of verse, both as typescripts and holographs. The topics represented include: prison reform, crime and punishment, historical views of sexuality, religion. =III. Diaries, 1886‚Äì1949= The bulk of the material consists of 122 volumes of diaries kept by Ives from the age of nineteen until about six months before his death at age eighty-two. Most of the diaries have daily entries for the period from 20 December 1886 to 16 November 1949. The view Ives provides in his diary of the life of an upper- middle class English homosexual from the end of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century is of particular interest for understanding the homosexual movement in England during this time. The content varies from descriptive impressions of social events to detailed examinations of his friends and acquaintances, analyses of the treatment of criminals, and the workings of prisons. From volume thirteen on, Ives indexed his diaries, and he often used them when he was preparing for a lecture or other writings. =IV. Miscellaneous, 1888‚Äì1949= This section includes the rules and wax seal impressions for the Order of Chaeronea, along with a library catalogue for the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, and a scrapbook of reviews and loose clippings for three of Ives' books, Eros' Throne (1900), A History of Penal Methods (1914), and Obstacles to Human Progress (1939).

Weeks Marine is a marine construction and dredging contractor based in Cranford, NJ. It was founded by Francis Weeks and his son Richard B. Weeks in 1919 as the Weeks Stevedoring Company.  Company  Weeks has three key divisions‚ÄîConstruction, Dredging and Marine Services‚Äîwhich are bolstered by two major subsidiaries, Healy Tibbitts Builders, Inc. and McNally International, Inc. Weeks manages a network of regional offices in Louisiana, Texas, Hawaii, Ontario and Nova Scotia.  History  Established in 1919 by Francis H. and Richard B. Weeks, the company started with two cranes in the Port of New York, handling bunker coal and dry ballast. By the beginning of World War II, they had purchased their seventh crane and were loading military equipment bound for Europe to support the Allied Forces. The workload of the war overseas had taken its toll on the Weeks fleet, so after WWII, the wooden hulls of the cranes were replaced with steel hulls, creating the Weeks #6 and #7. In the 1950s, the Weeks Stevedoring Company ventured into a number of marine projects outside the field of stevedoring. The company performed salvage and dredging work, installed navigational aids for the United States Coast Guard, and even constructed a breakwater to protect the air shaft leading from the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel to Governors Island. They also became the prime contractor assigned to remove abandoned wooden vessels for the Army Corps of Engineers, work still contracted today. In 1958, Weeks purchased their first crane to be used exclusively outside the field of stevedoring, the Weeks #500. In 1960, Weeks brought their first vessels to the fleet as two by deck barges were built by Richmond Steel for the company. In 1962, they added their first dump scow, the Weeks #250, a by vessel. Also in 1962, the Weeks Contracting Company was formed to remove limitations which might restrict the company in ventures they would choose to pursue. Over the next ten years, the Weeks barge fleet had grown proportionally, creating a vital infrastructural core of the Weeks operation today. During the 1970s, the first dredge, the Venture, a by hydraulic dredge, and the first large tug, the William J. McPhillips, a 2,400 horsepower single screw tug, were purchased in an effort to broaden the company even further. In the 1980s and 90s, the Weeks organization grew by acquiring other marine companies. During that time, Weeks substantial acquisitions were M.P. Howlett, a New York based stevedoring company, in 1983, American Dredging Company, one of the most famous dredging companies in history, in 1993, and T.L. James, another dredging company based in Louisiana, in 1998. Between 2001-2003, and 2008-2009, Weeks Marine was the prime consultant and contractor for the reefing of retired MTA New York City Subway cars from classes R26, R28, R29, R33, and R36 from the IRT's A Division, and classes R32, R38, R40 and R42 from the BMT/IND's B Division, which were retired, stripped and loaded onto barges and taken to designated reef sites in the States of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The cars were reefed into the Atlantic Ocean, thus creating an artificial and diving reefs from same.

He was responsible for the development and marketing of Windows, Internet Explorer, and online services such as Outlook.com and SkyDrive. Sinofsky is currently a board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where he serves on boards of investments. Early life and Education Steven Sinofsky was born in New York City in 1965 to parents Marsha and David Sinofsky. Growing up, Sinofsky attended Lake Brantley High School in Altamonte Springs, Florida. Subsequently, he attained his Bachelor of Arts from Cornell University, after graduating cum laude in 1987, in the fields of chemistry and computer science. Furthermore, he pursued his postgraduate education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he acquired a Masters of Science in computer science in 1989. He also spent 3 semesters learning Russian while he was in college. Career In July 1989, Sinofsky joined Microsoft as a software design engineer. In 1994, when the Office Product Unit was formed, Sinofsky joined the team as the director of program management, and led the design of the shared technologies in Microsoft Office 95 and Microsoft Office 97. He spent about four years as a software design engineer and project lead in the Development Tools group, where he helped lead the development of the first versions of the Microsoft Foundation Classes C++ library for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Visual C++. He previously oversaw the development of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers and services, responsible for the product development of Microsoft Office 2007 and its new ribbon UI. Prior to that he also oversaw the development of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office XP, and Microsoft Office 2000. Sinofsky was actively involved in recruiting for Microsoft. His particular task was to convince engineers not to move to Google. Sinofsky has blogged in detail about his efforts at Steven Sinofsky's Microsoft TechTalk, about what it's like to be a Microsoft employee, and what new hires in general most of the time never suspect or know about Microsoft, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and Windows. =Sinofsky at the Windows division= Steven Sinofsky became the president of the Windows division in July 2009. His first heavily involved projects included Windows Live Wave 3 and Internet Explorer 8. Sinofsky and Jon DeVaan also headed the development of the next major version of Windows to come after Windows Vista, Windows 7. Sinofsky's philosophy on Windows 7 was to not make any promises about the product or even discuss anything about the product until Microsoft was sure that it felt like a quality product. This was a radical departure from Microsoft's typical way of handling in-development versions of Windows, which was to publicly share all plans and details about it early in the development cycle. Sinofsky also refrained from labeling versions of Windows \\"major\\" or \\"minor\\", and instead just called them releases. Under Sinofsky's leadership, the Windows Division successfully shipped the successor to Windows Vista, Windows 7, which had a rapidly growing user-base of over 450 million. The success of Windows 7 contributed to record-breaking revenue earnings for Microsoft in 2010. Sinofsky's leadership style influenced many other Microsoft divisions to follow his principles and practices on product development. Sinofsky and Windows executive Jon DeVaan worked as editors for the Engineering Windows 7 blog. Sinofsky worked on Windows 8 and regularly blogged about the feature set and the process of developing the new OS in his blog, Building Windows 8. After Windows 8 reached the release to manufacturing milestone, it was indicated that Sinofsky and his team were working on a future version of the Windows operating system. Sinofsky left Microsoft on December 31, 2012. His departure was described by both parties as a mutual decision, but widely seen externally as the result of a power struggle or friction between himself ‚Äì tipped as a future leader of the company ‚Äì and CEO Steve Ballmer. Technology website Ars Technica drew attention to the sense of staffing changes after a major project ‚Äì the Windows 8 rollout, but also noted the abrupt and exceptional manner of departure and a similar analysis of recent politics within Microsoft by ZDNet. Sinofsky was succeeded by Julie Larson-Green and Tami Reller. Larson-Green will run the engineering function of Windows, while Reller will oversee the business operations. Microsoft disclosed in an SEC filing that Sinofsky would have a one-year non-compete contract in exchange for an estimated $14M of stock.June 2013 Microsoft SEC filing Book One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making, published by John Wiley & Sons in November 2009, was co-authored by Sinofsky and Marco Iansiti of Harvard Business School. The book discusses Sinofsky's struggle with refocusing the Windows Division after the Vista debacle, and the planning and development of the next major version of Windows that would come after Vista. Sinofsky talks about the focus of making a desirable high-quality product, while making no promises to the public, and shipping and delivering that product on time.

The story, written in December 1914 and the beginning of 1915, was not published in Kafka's lifetime. It first appeared in Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer (Berlin, 1931). The first English translation by Willa and Edwin Muir was published by Martin Secker in London in 1933. It appeared in The Great Wall of China. Stories and Reflections (New York: Schocken Books, 1946).The Great Wall of China: Stories and Reflections. Franz Kafka - 1946 - Schocken Books Plot introduction The narrator discusses the phenomenon of a giant mole in a far village, and the attempt of the village schoolmaster to bring its existence to the public attention, only to become an object of derision to the scientific community. Without knowing the schoolmaster, the narrator tries to defend him and his honesty in a paper about the giant mole. The narrator's attempts to help, stretched out in an unspecified stretch of years, are even more unsuccessful, only inspiring the teacher's jealousy and bitterness. In an argument during Christmas he and the village schoolmaster reveal the wildly different outcomes they had been hoping for all along. Without being able to finish the conversation, they reach a stalemate and the story ends abruptly. Process of writing Kafka discusses the story in a diary entry from December 19, 1914: > Yesterday wrote \\"The village schoolmaster\\" almost without knowing it, but > was afraid to go on writing later than a quarter to two; the fear was well > founded, I slept hardly at all, merely suffered through perhaps three short > dreams and was then in the office in the condition one would expect. > Yesterday father's reproaches on account of the factory: 'you talked me into > it.' Then went home and calmly wrote for three hours in the consciousness > that my guilt is beyond question, though not so great as father pictures it. > Kafka, Franz. The Diaries, 1910-1923. New York: Schocken Books, 1975. p. 322 In a January 6, 1915 entry Kafka mentions abandoning the story. References * Kafka, Franz (ed. Nahum N. Glatzer). The Complete Stories of Franz Kafka.

The surge in anti-British feeling which prompted these threats followed Bloody Sunday in January, and also resulted in the cancellation of the rugby union 1972 Five Nations Championship. As a result, Northern Ireland's home fixture was rescheduled to Hampden Park, effectively granting the Scottish team an extra home match. This was not the last time that The Troubles would interfere with the Home Championship; the 1981 British Home Championship would have to be abandoned following similar heightened tension after the death of Bobby Sands. Scotland used their home advantage well, securing victory over the Irish and Welsh to take a major points advantage into the final match against England, who had lost at home to Northern Ireland following a heavy defeat of Wales. In the last match however, England gained a slight advantage over their old rivals, winning 1‚Äì0 and thus equalling the tournament on points and resulting in a shared victory (goal difference was not at this stage used to differentiate between teams).

Ives became known in the UK after a piece in the Peterborough Column in the Daily Telegraph. His record as oldest British veteran, at 111 years, 146 days, of any war was broken on 1 November 2007 by First World War veteran Henry Allingham. Biography Ives was born in Brighton, England. The family worked for the Tidmarsh family. He worked in his father's workshop in Bristol until 1899. That December, Ives was eager to enlist after hearing that the British had been defeated at Colenso, Magersfontein. In the Boer War, George fought with the Imperial Yeomanry, along with 122 other veterans, of the British Army in South Africa. Ives emigrated to Canada in 1903 with his father and purchased of land for ten dollars. He was rejected from service in World War I because of a heart murmur. In 1910, he married Kay Nelson. The couple had three sons and three daughters. Nelson disliked the hard life of the prairies, so the family moved in 1919 to White Rock, British Columbia. Ives owned a farm there and eventually retired from it in 1941. He looked and found another job because he said that his retirement was an excuse to change jobs. He worked in a shipyard building wooden scows for another 15 years until 1956, when he finally announced his retirement. The Ives resided in the same house until 1984, after which they moved into a retirement home. His wife died in 1987. He attended the Royal Albert Hall service on Remembrance day 1992 in England and met Queen Elizabeth and her mother; Margaret Thatcher, and Prime Minister John Major. At the time, he was the last living veteran entitled to wear a Queen Victoria Medal and laid a wreath at the memorial.

He was a nephew to naturalist Friedrich Sigismund Leuckart (1794‚Äì1843).  Academic career  He earned his degree from the University of G√∂ttingen, where he was a student of Rudolf Wagner (1805‚Äì1864). Afterwards he participated on a scientific expedition to the North Sea for the study marine invertebrates. Later he became a professor of zoology at the University of Giessen (1850) and the University of Leipzig (1869).ADB: Leuckart, Rudolf @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.  Parasitological research  Leuckart is remembered for his work in parasitology, particularly research regarding tapeworm and trichinosis. He was the first to prove that Taenia saginata occurs only in cattle (and humans), and Taenia solium occurs only in swine (and humans). His study of Trichina helped support Rudolf Virchow's campaign to create meat inspection laws in Germany. With Virchow and Friedrich Albert von Zenker (1825‚Äì1898), he was the first to document the life cycle of the parasite Trichinella spiralis in swine and humans. He, and independently Algernon Thomas, experimentally discovered the life-cycle of the sheep liver fluke in 1881‚Äì1883. Today the \\"Rudolf- Leuckart-Medaille\\" is an annual award given for research in parasitology by the Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Parasitologie (German Society of Parasitology).  Other contributions  Leuckart is credited with splitting George Cuvier's Radiata into two phyla: Coelenterata and Echinodermata. As a scientist, his provided excellent descriptions of morphologic details giving credence to the idea that zoological evolution can be learned through its anatomical changes. Between 1877 and 1892, he developed a series of zoological wall charts that have been used worldwide as teaching aids. In the field of entomology, he conducted investigations into the micropyle and fertilization of insect eggs, the reproduction and development involving members of Pupipara, parthenogenesis among insects, and studies on the anatomy and life history of the honeybee.

With 4 Birinci Lig titles, 3 Cumhurba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± Kupasƒ± (President's Cup), 2 Dr. Fazƒ±l K√º√ß√ºk Kupasƒ± titles and 1 Ba≈übakanlƒ±k Kupasi (Prime Minister's Cup) title to its name, the club is among the most successful sports clubs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus football. History The football leagues were set up in Cyprus upon the establishment of Cyprus Football Association in 1934 and √áetinkaya T√ºrk S.K. joined the Cypriot First Division as the sole representative of the Turkish Cypriot community. The idea of Turkish Cypriots living in Baf establishing a sports club started to evolve and in 1947 a petition was submitted to the British authorities ruling Cyprus at that time for the formation of the club. Two prominent members of the Turkish Cypriot community in Baf were assigned the responsibility to proceed with the establishment of the club; Mr. Halit Ali Rƒ±za and Mr. Dervi≈ü Ahmet Ra≈üit. The petition was approved and √úlk√º Yurdu Spor Kul√ºb√º was formally established on 23 April 1947. Since the petition was prepared by Mr. Halit Ali Rƒ±za, who was a lawyer, he became the founding president of √úlk√º Yurdu Spor Kul√ºb√º and Mr. Dervi≈ü Ahmet Ra≈üit was elected as the first president in the first assembly of club's members. A house was rented in Moutallos neighbourhood of Baf that served as the headquarters of the club. =1947‚Äì1960= Upon its establishment, √úlk√º Yurdu became a focal point in the lives of the Turkish Cypriot community in Baf. Due to the inter- communal conflict between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots at the time, the club did not register to play in the Cypriot First Division and only participated in some friendly matches. When the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation was formed in 1955, √úlk√º Yurdu was invited to the league that was to be formed as the sole representative team from Baf. From 1955 to 1960, √úlk√º Yurdu participated at various levels of the Turkish Cypriot league that was formed. =1961‚Äì1980= In early 1960s, √úlk√º Yurdu continued to take part in the Turkish Cypriot football league. The team achieved its highest ranking during the 1963‚Äì64 season when it was ranked 2nd in the First Division of the Turkish Cypriot football league. However, that season was not completed due to the increased level of inter-communal violence between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The league was resumed in 1968‚Äì69 season and √úlk√º Yurdu became a regular in the league in the years that followed. Following the summer of 1974, the Turkish Cypriot community in Baf moved to the north of the island due to the political situation in Cyprus. The majority of the Turkish Cypriot community of Baf settled in G√ºzelyurt, which also became √úlk√º Yurdu's new home. The club added Baf meaning Paphos in Turkish to its name in order to stay loyal to its roots. =1981‚Äì2000= √úlk√º Yurdu enjoyed great success during the later part of the 1980s. The team was crowned the champions of the Turkish Cypriot First Division four years in a row; in 1986‚Äì87, in 1987‚Äì88, in 1988‚Äì89 and in 1989‚Äì90. √úlk√º Yurdu became the first team to achieve such a feat and no other Turkish Cypriot team has achieved the same level of success to date. √úlk√º Yurdu also won the Cumhurba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ± Kupasƒ± (President's Cup) 3 times and Dr. Fazƒ±l K√º√ß√ºk Kupasƒ± twice during the same period. Following its success at home, √úlk√º Yurdu became the first Turkish Cypriot football team to be invited to a tournament in Turkey and won it as well. The team entered into a gradual decline afterwards and was relegated to ƒ∞kinci Lig in the 1994‚Äì95 season. Despite being promoted back to Birinci Lig in the 1997‚Äì98 season, the team did not manage to survive and spent the later parts of 1990s between Birinci Lig and ƒ∞kinci Lig. =2001‚Äì2010= Due to economic underdevelopment and negligence of the G√ºzelyurt area, √úlk√º Yurdu continued to suffer from inconsistency during the early 2000s.

It is the 14th and penultimate song on their second album Absolutely Free. The song is one of his most widely renowned works, declared by the AllMusic as \\"Zappa's first real masterpiece\\". History The title was inspired by an event covered by Time magazine reporter Hugh Sidey in 1966. The reporter correctly guessed that something was amiss when the fastidiously dressed President Lyndon B. Johnson made the sartorial faux pas of wearing brown shoes with a gray suit. Johnson flew to Vietnam for a surprise public relations visit later that day. Live versions of this song are featured on the albums Tinsel Town Rebellion and Road Tapes, Venue 2. Music and lyrics The lyrics start off as a general attack on suburban American society: TV, greed and conformity are all mocked openly in the song. It then shifts in tone, dealing with a city hall official fantasizing about having sex with a thirteen-year-old girl. The music makes several stylistic shifts, covering hard rock, classical, psychedelic rock, music hall and jazz. It is cited by AllMusic as being a \\"condensed two-hour musical\\". The song lasts 7:30 and is the twelfth track (fourteenth on CD reissues) on Absolutely Free. According to Zappa, the beginning background music was inspired by Lightnin' Slim's \\"Have Your Way\\". Reception The song has received widespread acclaim from critics, and is considered by many as \\"Zappa's first masterpiece\\". In a positive review of the album, Dominique Chevalier said \\"there are snatches of dodecaphonic scales, ballads, rock, R&B;, Beach Boys, soap opera and more ... and ensures that this is no piece of easy listening\\".Chevalier, Dominique \\"Viva Zappa!\\" 1985 Page 62 As well as giving its parent album 4.5 stars, AllMusic gave a very positive review of the song.http://www.allmusic.com/song/brown-shoes-dont-make-it-t998763 allmusic review It is also included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

He was one of the early innovators of the wooden movable type printing technology. His illustrated agricultural treatise was also one of the most advanced of its day, covering a wide range of equipment and technologies available in the late 13th and early 14th century. Life and works Wang Zhen was born in Shandong province, and spent many years as an official of both Anhui and Jiangxi provinces.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 59. From 1290 to 1301, he was a magistrate for Jingde, Anhui province, where he was a pioneer of the use of wooden movable type printing. The wooden movable type was described in Wang Zhen's publication of 1313, known as the Nong Shu (), or Book of Agriculture. Although the title describes the main focus of the work, it incorporated much more information on a wide variety of subjects that was not limited to the scope of agriculture. Wang's Nong Shu of 1313 was a very important medieval treatise outlining the application and use of the various Chinese sciences, technologies, and agricultural practices. From water powered bellows to movable type printing, it is considered a descriptive masterpiece on contemporary medieval Chinese technology. Wang wrote the masterpiece Nong Shu for many practical reasons, but also as a means to aid and support destitute rural farmers in China looking for means to improve their economic livelihoods in the face of poverty and oppression during the Yuan period.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 60. Although the previous Song Dynasty was a period of high Chinese culture and relative economic and agricultural stability, the conquering Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty thoroughly damaged the economic and agricultural base of China during the conquest of it. Hence, a book such as the Nong Shu could help rural farmers maximize efficiency of producing yields and they could learn how to use various agricultural tools to aid their daily lives. However, it was not intended to be read by rural farmers (who were largely illiterate), but local officials who desired to research the best agricultural methods currently available that the peasants otherwise would know little of. The Nong Shu was an incredibly long book even for its own time, which had over 110,000 written Chinese characters. However, this was only slightly larger than the early medieval Chinese agricultural treatise Chi Min Yao Shu written by Jia Sixia in 535, which had slightly over 100,000 written Chinese characters.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 56. Technological innovations =Water powered bellows= An illustration of furnace bellows operated by waterwheels, from the Nong Shu, by Wang Zhen, 1313, during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. The Chinese during the Han Dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì AD 220) were the first to apply hydraulic power (i.e. a waterwheel) in working the inflatable bellows of the blast furnace in creating cast iron. This was recorded in AD 31, an innovation of the engineer Du Shi, Prefect of Nanyang.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 370 After Du Shi, Chinese in subsequent dynastic periods continued the use of water power to operate the bellows of the blast furnace. In the 5th century text of the Wu Chang Ji, its author Pi Ling wrote that a planned, artificial lake had been constructed in the Yuan- Jia reign period (424‚Äì429) for the sole purpose of powering water wheels aiding the smelting and casting processes of the Chinese iron industry.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 371-371. The 5th-century text Shui Jing Zhu mentions the use of rushing river water to power waterwheels, as does the Tang Dynasty geography text of the Yuan-he Jun Xian Tu Chi, written in 814.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 373. Although Du Shi was the first to apply water power to bellows in metallurgy, the first drawn and printed illustration of its operation with water power came in 1313, with Wang Zhen's Nong Shu.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 371. Wang explained the methods used for the water-powered blast-furnace in previous times and in his era of the 14th century: File:Áª≥ËΩ¶.jpg File:Á∫∫ÁªáÊú∫.jpg File:Ê∞¥Á£®ÈΩøËΩÆ.jpg File:Ê∞¥Êç£.jpg File:Ê∞¥ËΩÆ.jpg File:Ê∞¥Èî§.jpg =Wang's movable type printing= In improving movable type printing, Wang mentioned an alternative method of baking porcelain printing type with earthenware frame in order to make whole blocks.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 203. Wang is best known for his usage of wooden movable type while he was a magistrate of Jingde in Anhui province from 1290 to 1301.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 206. His main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable types.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 208. Wang summarized the process of making wooden movable type as described in the passage below: A revolving table typecase with individual movable type characters arranged primarily by rhyming scheme, from Wang Zhen's Nong Shu, published 1313. Wooden movable type had been used and experimented with by Bi Sheng in the 11th century, but it was discarded because wood was judged to be an unsuitable material to use.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 205-206 Wang improved the earlier experimented process by adding the methods of specific type cutting and finishing, making the type case and revolving table that made the process more efficient.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 207 In Wang's system, all the Chinese writing characters were organized by five different tones and according to rhyming, using a standard official book of Chinese rhymes. Two revolving tables were actually used in the process; one table that had official types from the book of rhymes, and the other which contained the most frequently used Chinese writing characters for quick selection. To make the entire process more efficient, each Chinese character was assigned a different number, so that when a number was called, that writing character would be selected. Rare and unusual characters that were not prescribed a number were simply crafted on the spot by wood-cutters when needed. While printing new books, Wang described that the rectangular dimensions of each book needed to be determined in order to make the corrected size of the four-sided wooden block used in printing. Providing the necessary ink job was done by brush that was moved vertically in columns, while the impression on paper the columns had to be rubbed with brush from top to bottom. Two centuries before Hua Sui pioneered bronze-type printing in China in 1490, Wang had experimented with printing using tin, a metal favored for its low melting point while casting.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 217 In the Nong Shu, Wang wrote: Thus, Chinese metal type of the 13th century using tin was unsuccessful because it was incompatible with the inking process. Although unsuccessful in Wang's time, the bronze metal type of Hua Sui in the late 15th century would be used for centuries in China, up until the late 19th century.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 216-217. The Chinese Diamond Sutra (868), the oldest existent woodblock printed book in the world. Although Wang's Nong Shu was mostly printed by use of woodblock printing, his innovation of wooden movable type soon became popularly used in the region of Anhui. Wang's wooden movable type was used to print the local gazetteer paper of Jingde City, which incorporated the use of 60,000 written characters organized on revolving tables. During the year of 1298, roughly one hundred copies of this were printed by wooden movable type in a month's time. Following in the footsteps of Wang, in 1322 the magistrate of Fenghua, Zhejiang province, named Ma Chengde, printed Confucian classics with movable type of 100,000 written characters on needed revolving tables. The process of metal movable type was also developed in Joseon Korea by the 13th century, while metal movable type was not pioneered in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) printer Hua Sui used bronze movable type in 1490. Although metal movable type became available in China during the Ming period, wooden movable type persisted in common use even until the 19th century.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 208-209. After that point, the European printing press machine first pioneered by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century became the mainstay and standard in China and for the most part the global community until the advent of digital printing and the modern computer printer. With movable type printing during the Ming dynasty of the 14th to 16th centuries, however, it was known to be used by local academies, local government offices, by wealthy local patrons of printing, and the large Chinese commercial printers located in the cities of Nanjing, Suzhou, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 209. There were many books from a wide variety of subjects published in wooden movable type during the Ming period, including novels, art, science and technology, family registers, and local gazettes. In 1541, two different significant publications using wooden movable type were made under the sponsorship of two different princes; the Prince of Shu printing the large literary collection of the earlier Song Dynasty poet Su Che, and the Prince of Yi printing a book written as a rebuttal against superstitions written by a Yuan Dynasty era author. During the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1911), wooden movable type was used on a much wider scale than even the previous Ming period. It was officially sponsored by the imperial court at Beijing, yet was widespread amongst private printing companies. The creation of movable type writing fonts became a wise enterprise of investment, since they were commonly pawned, sold, or presented as gifts during the Qing period. In the sphere of the imperial court, the official Jin Jian (d. 1794) was placed in charge of printing at the Wuying Palace, where the Yongzheng Emperor had 253,000 wooden movable type characters crafted in the year of 1733. Jin Jian, the official in charge of this project, provided elaborate detail on the printing process in his Wu Ying Tian Ju Zhen Ban Cheng Shi (Imperial Printing Office Manual for Movable Type). In nineteen different sections, he provided detailed description for: *type body *cutting the type *making type cases *form trays *strips in variable thickness *blanks *center columns *sorting trays *page and column rule forms *setting the text *proofing *printing *distribution of the type *and a schedule for rotation There are notable differences between Wang's movable type process and Jin Jian's. Wang carved the written characters on wooden blocks and then sawed them apart, while Jin initiated the process by preparing type bodies before the characters were individually cut into types.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 211. For setting type, Wang employed a method of revolving tables where the type came to the workers, whereas Jin developed a system where the workers went to the organized type. Wang's frame was also added after the type had already been set, whereas Jin printed the ruled sheets and text separately on the same paper. =Agriculture= harrow. The main focus of the Nong Shu written by Wang was the realm of Chinese agriculture. His book listed and described an enormous catalogue of agricultural tools and implements used in the past and in his own day.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 75. Furthermore, Wang incorporated a systematic usage of illustrated pictures in his book to accompany every piece of farming equipment described.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 92. Wang also created an agricultural calendrical diagram in the form of a circle, which included the Heavenly Stems, the Earthly Branches, the four seasons, twelve months, twenty-four solar terms, seventy-two five-day periods, with each sequence of agricultural tasks and the natural phenomena which signal for their necessity, stellar configurations, phenology, and the sequence of agricultural production.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 53-55. Amongst the various contemporary agricultural practices mentioned in the Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, cultivation of mulberries, etc. It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China. The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but food-processing, irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications. For example, one of the many devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large mechanical milling plant operated by the motive power of oxen, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the toothed gears of eight different mills surrounding it.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 195-196. Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 61-62.

The origin of Kashtha Sangha is often attributed to Lohacharya in several texts and inscriptions from Delhi region. The Kashtasangh Gurvavali identifies Lohacharya as the last person who knew Acharanga in the Digambara tradition, who lived until the 683rd year of the nirvana of Lord Mahavira. the Darshanasara of Devasena (VS 990) attributes the origin to Kumarasena in Vikram Samvat 753.
