Its territory borders the municipalities of Accadia, Anzano di Puglia, Ariano Irpino (AV), Panni, San Sossio Baronia (AV), Sant'Agata di Puglia, Savignano Irpino (AV), Zungoli (AV). History In 1942, during World War II, Monteleone was the seat of a revolt women, sparked by the arrogance of a Carabinieri officer who confiscated a pot of corn flour that was being carried to a local bakery by three women. The women resisted, pleading with the officer. The women were brought by the officer to the Fascist regime-appointed mayor. The mayor sided with the officer, and the women were promptly imprisoned in a warehouse filled with cheese and other foods. The women set the warehouse on fire and escaped. Upon hearing of the hoards of food being stored by the Carabinieri while the people were hungry, an angry mob formed and the Carabinieri office was stormed. Police had trouble controlling the riot and fired warning shots into the air. Soon after, police began firing bullets towards the crowd. Eventually, the citizens of Monteleone - armed with clubs and pitchforks - were subdued. Overall, 180 citizens were arrested and detained. Most rioters arrested had to serve a prison sentence of between a few days and 15 months. This revolt was the first of its kind in Italy during the Second World War. In the years following the war, a large number of migrants from the town and their descendants established an expatriate community in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There is a club in Toronto for those who have roots in Monteleone. Festivals The patron saints of Monteleone are San Rocco and Saint John the Baptist.

The high plain is also known as the Buckskin Mountain, Buckskin Plateau, and Kaibab Mountain. Description View of the Vermillion Cliffs (to the northeast) from the Kaibab Plateau, June 2008 The plateau, part of the larger Colorado Plateau, is bordered on the south by the Grand Canyon and reaches an elevation of . The plateau is divided between Kaibab National Forest and the \\"North Rim\\" portion of Grand Canyon National Park. Tributary canyons of the Colorado River form the plateau's eastern and western boundaries, and tiers of uplifted cliffs define the northern edges of the landform. Winter snowfall is often heavy (sometimes exceeding ), and this creates opportunities for backcountry Nordic skiing and snow camping. This broad feature is heavily forested with aspen, spruce-fir, ponderosa pine, and pinyon-juniper woodland, and stands in sharp contrast to the arid lowlands encircling it. The cool forests of the plateau are home to the Kaibab squirrel, which is endemic to the region. Other fauna includes deer, turkey, cougar, and bobcat. The Kaibab deer are particularly important because of the changes in their population during the early 1900s. This particular fluctuation is a great example of population engineering and the effects humans can have on nature. Physiography The Kaibab Plateau consists of approximately which are above . The highest point has an elevation of , a topographic prominence of , and a topographic isolation of . The plateau is bounded on the south by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, the elevation in this southern area of the plateau varies from to slightly less than . The most extensive platform of the plateau is the Esplanade, which is called \\"Sand Rocks\\" by local cowboys. This area was formed as a result from weathering of the Hermit shale, which left a hard layer of Permian sandstone exposed. This red sandstone is one of the outstanding features of the plateau. The plateau's western boundary is the Kanab Creek Canyon which high perpendicular walls form a natural barrier to the movement of most animals. The northwestern boundary of the plateau is marked by a fault line north of the Snake Gulch which is approximately sixteen miles to the east of the Kanab Creek. The eastern boundary is marked by the so-called Houserock Valley, which is a marble platform caused by a monoclinical fold, which strata dips down 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Climate The climate of the Kaibab Plateau consists of rain and thunderstorms in late summer during the summer monsoon season, snow, heavy at times, in winter, and drier weather in early summer. There was an average annual precipitation of for the period 1925 to 1936. During winter, snow is heavy and often accumulates at a depth of . June is the driest month of the year, followed by May and early July. Storms occur several times each week until early September. The highest portions of the plateau are usually touched by snow, and snowstorms usually occur in May and September. Kaibab deer Kaibab deer from the DOCUMERICA series, a program sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency to photograph subjects of American environmental concern during the 1970s, May 1972 image At the beginning of the 20th century, the Kaibab Plateau was witness to an interesting experiment in what some might call population engineering. The plateau's pre-1905 population of mule deer was estimated to be around 4,000. This number was never confirmed by any kind of count or survey, and has become an accepted number mainly because no other estimate is available. The average carrying capacity of the land was unknown, in part because this concept was not widely used by naturalists at the time. Years later, Aldo Leopold estimated that the capacity had been about 30,000 deer. The idea in 1906 was simply to protect and expand the herd, so on November 28, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon National Game Preserve. Overgrazing by herds of sheep, cattle, and horses had taken place on the plateau since the 1880s. During that time, many predators were also killed by ranchers and bounty hunters. By the time Roosevelt established the game preserve, ranchers had moved most domestic livestock elsewhere. The primary change brought by the creation of the game preserve was to ban deer hunting. Government efforts, led by the United States Forest Service, began to protect the deer's numbers by killing off their natural predators once again; to this end, between 1907 and 1939, 816 mountain lions, 20 wolves, 7388 coyotes and over 500 bobcats were reportedly killed. The deer population experienced a great increase in numbers during the early decades of the 20th century. One estimate put the population as high as 100,000 deer inhabiting the range in 1924. Again, there was no systematic survey to support this estimate, which may have been exaggerated to twice the actual number. Shortly after that time, however, the deer population did begin to decline from over-browsing. By the mid-1920s, many deer were starving to death. After a heated legal dispute between the federal government and the state of Arizona, hunting was once more permitted, to reduce the deer's numbers. Hunters were able to kill only a small fraction of the starving deer. The range itself was damaged, and its carrying capacity was greatly reduced. =Prey and predator population dynamics= X Fire Tree Planting Restoration Project, Kaibab National Forest, April 2012 Once ecologists began to study the area and reflect on the changes that had occurred there, they began to use the Kaibab deer as a simple lesson about how the removal of the deer's natural predators, which had been done in the interest of preserving the deer population, had allowed the deer to over- reproduce, and quickly overwhelm the plateau's resources. Some ecologists suggested that the situation highlighted the importance of keeping a population in balance with its environment's carrying capacity. The more meaningful lesson of the Kaibab suggests that human efforts to protect wildlife and preserve wild areas must be balanced with ecological complexity and social priorities that are difficult to predict. Changes take place, sometimes rapidly, but their effects linger for decades. Today, the Arizona Game Commission manages the area, controlling the numbers of deer as well as predators, and issues hunting permits to keep the deer in balance with the range. Kaibab Lake in the Williams Ranger District, Kaibab National Forest, August 2020 Although the story of the Kaibab deer rose to fame in the 1920s due to their sudden increase and decrease in population, the story can also be used to demonstrate the way in which scientific studies and ideas about history can help educate current students. The first interpretation of the deer story as demonstrated in textbooks was that predator control had destroyed the deer‚Äôs population growth. It was thought that initially the high number of deer predators were obtruding the growth of the deer‚Äôs population, therefore rules were put in place in order to minimize the predator population and allow the deer to increase their population size. However, as scientific studies continued, ecologist Greame Caughley suggested that predator control alone could not have caused the Kaibab irruption, but rather factors like climate, grazing by other animals, and preservation policies actually had more significant impacts on the deer Caughley‚Äôs opinion led to confusion by teachers and scientists over what to include and teach in ecology and biology classes, therefore this story stopped being used as an example of prey and predator population dynamics. This is important to the development of scientific studies because it shows that events‚Äî-like the Kaibab deer controversy‚Äî-do not have a definitive start and beginning but include other opinions and approaches which teachers use to showcase the richness of controversy. The Kaibab deer controversy has revolutionized the way science is taught in textbooks, and the way students question ecology and biology. In addition, students now learn that human intervention can lead to big repercussions regarding specific animal‚Äôs population and development in certain regions.

Directed by Charles Walters, the screenplay is by Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Sidney Sheldon, the songs are by Harry Warren (music) and Ira Gershwin (lyrics) with the addition of \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\" by George and Ira Gershwin, and the choreography was created by Robert Alton and Hermes Pan. Also featured in the cast were Oscar Levant, Billie Burke, Jacques Fran√ßois and Gale Robbins. Rogers came in as a last minute replacement for Judy Garland, whose frequent absences due to a dependency on prescription medication cost her the role. This turned out to be the last film that Astaire and Rogers made together, and their only film together in color. Plot Josh and Dinah Barkley (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) are a husband-and-wife musical comedy team at the peak of their careers. After finishing a new show, Dinah meets serious French playwright Jacques Pierre Barredout (Jacques Fran√ßois), who suggests that Dinah should take up dramatic acting. Dinah tries to keep the suggestion a secret from Josh, but when he finally discovers Dinah hiding a script for Jacques' new show from him, the couple splits up. Their good friend, acerbic composer Ezra Millar (Oscar Levant) tries to trick them back together again, but fails. When Josh secretly watches Dinah's rehearsals for Barredout's new play and sees how she is struggling, he calls her up and pretends to be the Frenchman, giving her notes that help her to understand her part, the young Sarah Bernhardt. As the result, Dinah gives a brilliant performance. After the show, she accidentally learns that her late-night mentor was Josh and not Barredout, so she rushes to Josh's apartment and the two reconcile.

Barkleys was his first film in English, and was to be his last American film, although he appeared in two U.K.-based productions. His French film career was extensive: he worked up until his death in 2003. Production The Barkleys of Broadway began with the working title of You Made Me Love You, and with Judy Garland in the lead role opposite Fred Astaire, a repeat of their pairing in Easter Parade (1948). In fact, producer Arthur Freed had Comden and Green working on the script for the new film even before Easter Parade was finished. The film went into rehearsals with Garland, but it was soon clear that she would not be physically and emotionally able to do it. Freed contacted Ginger Rogers to see if she was interested in reuniting with Astaire: there had been rumors, denied by both, that the Astaire-Rogers working relationship had not been particularly warm, and they had not worked together since The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle in 1939. Rogers was interested, and The Barkleys of Broadway became their tenth and final film together, as well as their only film in color. The production period was from 8 August through 30 October 1948, with some additional work on 28 December. The Technicolor process required very bright lights which were uncomfortable to work under. While the film was in production, Fred Astaire won an honorary Academy Award for \\"his unique artistry and his contributions to the technique of musical pictures,\\" presented to him at the awards ceremony by Ginger Rogers. The Barkleys of Broadway premiered in New York on 4 May 1949 and went into general American release shortly after.IMDB Release dates Songs * \\"Swing Trot\\" ‚Äì music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Ira Gershwin.

The basic conventions of yayue were established in the Western Zhou. Together with law and rites, it formed the formal representation of aristocratic political power. The word ya (ÈõÖ) was used during the Zhou dynasty to refer to a form of song-texts used in court and collected in Shijing. The term yayue itself appeared in the Analects, where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting. Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance. It means the kind of solemn ceremonial music used in court, as well as ritual music in temples including those used in Confucian rites. In a broader sense, yayue can also mean a form of Chinese music that is distinguishable from the popular form of music termed suyue (‰øóÊ®Ç) or \\"uncultivated music\\", and can therefore also include music of the literati such as qin music. The court yayue has largely disappeared from China, although there are modern attempts at its reconstruction. In Taiwan yayue is performed as part of a Confucian ceremony, and in China in a revived form as entertainment for tourists. Other forms of yayue are still found in parts of East Asia, notably the gagaku in Japan, aak in Korea, and nh√£ nh·∫°c in Vietnam. Although the same word is used in these countries (but pronounced differently), the music does not necessarily correspond to Chinese yayue. The Korean aak however preserved elements of Song dynasty yayue long lost in China. History According to tradition, yayue was created by the Duke of Zhou under commission from King Wu of Zhou, shortly after the latter's conquest of Shang. Incorporated within yayue were elements of shamanistic or religious traditions, as well as early Chinese folk music. Dance was also closely associated with yayue music, each yayue pieces may have a ceremonial or ritual dance associated with it. The most important yayue piece of the Zhou dynasty were the Six Great Dances, each associated with a legendary or historical figure ‚Äì Yunmen Dajuan (Èõ≤ÈñÄÂ§ßÂç∑), Daxian (Â§ßÂí∏), Daqing (Â§ßÁ£¨, or Dashao Â§ßÈü∂), Daxia (Â§ßÂ§è), and Dahu (Â§ßÊø©), Dawu (Â§ßÊ≠¶). Note some of alternate names given for these dances, such as Xianchi (Âí∏Ê±†), Dashao (Â§ßÈü∂), and Dazhang (Â§ßÁ´†) The Book of Rites records a number of situations where yayue might be performed. These included ceremonies in honour of Heaven and Earth, the gods or the ancestors. There were also detailed rules on the way they were to be performed at diplomatic meetings. Yayue was also used in outdoor activities, such as aristocratic archery contests, during hunting expeditions, and after the conclusion of a successful military campaign. Yayue was characterised by its rigidity of form. When performed, it was stately and formal, serving to distinguish the aristocractic classes. It was sometimes also accompanied by lyrics. Some of these are preserved in the Book of Songs. With the decline of the importance ceremony in the interstate relations of the Spring and Autumn period, so did yayue. Confucius famously lamented the decline of classical music and the rites. Marquess Wen of Wei was said to prefer the popular music of Wey and Zheng to the ancient court music, listening to which he may fall asleep. Much of the yayue of the Zhou dynasty continued into the Qin dynasty. However, some pieces appeared to have been lost or were no longer performed by the Han dynasty, and the content and form of yayue was modified in this as well as the succeeding dynasties. During the Tang dynasty components of popular music were added to yayue. However, the dominant form of music in the Sui and Tang court was the entertainment music for banquets called yanyue (ÁáïÊ®Ç), and the term yayue became reserved for the music of Confucian rituals used in temples of the Imperial Family and the nobility as well as in Confucian temples. During the Song dynasty, with Neo-Confucianism becoming the new orthodoxy, Yayue was again in ascendancy with major development, and a yayue orchestra in this era consisted of over 200 instrumentalists. Two important texts from the Song dynasty describing yayue performances are Zhu Xi's Complete Explanation of the Classic of Etiquette and Its Commentary (ÂÑÄÁ¶ÆÁ∂ìÂÇ≥ÈÄöËß£) and Collection of Music (Ê®ÇÊõ∏) by Chen Yang (Èô≥Êöò). In 1116, a gift of 428 yayue instruments as well as 572 costumes and dance objects was given to Korea by Emperor Huizong upon request by the Emperor Yejong of Goryeo. As a result, elements of Song dynasty yayue music such as melodies are still preserved in Korea. Some forms of yayue survived for imperial ceremonies and rituals until the fall of the Qing dynasty when the imperial period of China came to an end. Yayue however was still performed as part of a Confucian ritual in China until the Communist takeover in 1949 when it completely disappeared. There has been a revival in yayue in Confucian ritual in Taiwan since the late 1960s, and in mainland China since the 1990s. A major research and modern reconstruction of yayue of the imperial court was initiated in Taiwan in the 1990s, and in mainland China a performance of yayue music in 2009 by Nanhua University's yayue music ensemble in Beijing also spurred interest in this form of music. There are however questions over the authenticity of these revived and recreated yayue music and dances, especially the use of modern forms of instruments and various substitutions rather than the more ancient and original forms, nonetheless some argued that such music and dances have always changed over time through succeeding dynasties, and that any changes introduced in the modern era should be seen in this light. Performance The court yayue orchestra may be divided into two separate ensembles that may represent the yin and yang, a smaller one (the yin) that was meant to play on the terraces of a building, and a larger one (the yang) that performed in the courtyard. The smaller ensemble consisted of mainly chordophones (such as qin and se zithers) and aerophones (such as the dizi and xiao flutes, and panpipes), as well as singers. The larger ensemble was primarily instrumental and contained all the categories of musical instruments with the musicians arranged in five directions (four points of the compass and the center) in the courtyard. The wind instruments occupied the center, and the bronze bells and stone chimes at the four sides, while the drums occupied the four corners. At the front were two wooden instruments, used to mark the start and end of a piece. The 'outside' music in the courtyard was meant for the praise of heaven, and the size and disposition of the orchestra varied with the importance of the occasion, while the 'inside' music was used to extol the virtue of the emperors and their ancestors. A dance performed at the Jongmyo jerye in the Confucian Jongmyo temple in Korea The music is typically slow and stately, and monophonic with little rhythmic variety. When sung, there may be four to eight beats per phrase depending on the number of words in the text. The music performed in the courtyard are accompanied by dances, and the number of dancers varies strictly according to the rank and social status of the patron. The emperor may have the largest number of musicians and dancers (64 dancers in eight rows of eight), while a noble or chief minister may have a smaller ensemble and 36 dancers (six rows of six), and a lesser officer even fewer (four by four or two by two). In Confucian rituals the six row dance (ÂÖ≠‰ΩæËàû) was originally performed as appropriate for the status of Confucius, later the eight row dance (ÂÖ´‰ΩæËàû) was also performed as Confucius had been granted various posthumous regal titles, for example the title of King Wenxuan (ÊñáÂÆ£Áéã) that was granted by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang dynasty. The dances are divided into two types: Civil dance and Military dance. In Civil Dance the dancers hold a yue flute (Á±•) in their left hand and a feather plume (ÁæΩ) in their right, while in Military Dance the dancer may hold a shield (Âπ≤) in the left hand and a battleaxe (Êàö) in the right hand. Instruments used bronze bells (Bianzhong) from the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, dated 433 BC. Yayue music does not use just any kind of traditional Chinese musical instruments, but instead includes only a small selection, taken from the oldest ones, according to the eight categories of materials used in their construction.Fran√ßois Picard.

Biography =Early life and career= Steranko History of Comics 2 (1972), helped introduce Fine's art to a new generation. Lou Fine was born in either the Manhattan or BrooklynInterview with son Elliot Fine, Alter Ego, p. 15: \\"He was probably born in Brooklyn\\". \\"His father was...probably a Russian immigrant, though I don't know where he was born\\". boroughs of New York City, the son of a house painter, Meyer, who was possibly a Russian immigrant. Fine's mother died while Fine was attending Cooper Union college, studying engineering. He had an older brother, Sam, who died in October 2000, at age 86, and a sister. According to Fine's son Elliot, Lou Fine's family lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of \\"East New York, which was called Brownsville in those days.... It was a tenement Jewish neighborhood back then\\". Either at about age two or in his early teens, Fine's left leg became crippled by polio. Developing a talent for art, and influenced by such commercial illustrators and other artists as Dean Cornwell, Heinrich Kley, and J.C. Leyendecker, Fine went on to study at Manhattan's Grand Central Art School and Brooklyn's Pratt Institute. In 1938, Fine, like many other comics artists of the time, found work at Eisner & Iger, a prominent \\"packager\\" that supplied complete comic books to publishers testing the emerging medium. Fine's first published comics art was the strip \\"Wilton of the West\\" in Fiction House's Jumbo Comics #4 (Dec. 1938), signed with the house pen name Fred Sande (which strip originator Jack Kirby had used in previous issues). Other early pseudonyms Fine employed (reflecting the fledgling Eisner & Iger's attempts to convince publishers they had a large stable of artists) were Curt Davis and Basil Berold. Eisner would later say, \\"I had respect for his towering kind of draftsmanship. He was the epitome of the honest draftsman. No fakery, no razzle-dazzle ‚Äî very direct, very honest in his approach\\". Fine went on to do exquisite and acclaimed work for Fox Feature Syndicate, where he supplied the cover of 1939's Blue Beetle #1 and drew such features as \\"The Flame\\" in Wonderworld Comics and the later eponymous series. For publisher Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold's Quality Comics, he drew features including \\"The Black Condor\\" (initially under the pseudonym Kenneth Lewis) in Crack Comics; \\"Doll Man\\" (under the pseudonym William Erwin Maxwell) in Feature Comics; \\"The Ray\\" (initially under the jokey pseudonym E. Lectron) in Smash Comics; \\"Uncle Sam\\" (for which Eisner & Iger co-founder Will Eisner received credit) in National Comics; and \\"Stormy Foster\\" in Hit Comics. Fine became particularly prominent as a cover artist. Fine, along with Plastic Man creator Jack Cole, was a ghost-artist on Will Eisner's celebrated Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book The Spirit during Eisner's World War II military service, Fine inking over Cole's pencil work. Some of these were reprinted in Quality's Police Comics and The Spirit comic book, where Fine's work continued to appear through 1949, five years after Fine had left comics. Joe Simon, an artist and the first editor of Marvel Comics, called Fine his \\"favorite artist.... He was also Jack Kirby's favorite artist. I know that Jack was a fan of and greatly influenced by Fine‚Äôs work\\". =Advertising and comic strips= Leaving comic books in 1944, Fine segued into newspapers by drawing Sunday advertising comics.

Fine also worked on the strip Space Conquerors in the magazine Boys' Life from the late 1960s until his death. He and writer Gill Fox, whom he had met during his time with Eisner & Iger and remained in contact with, were developing new comic strips when Fine was found dead of a heart attack in his studio.Interview with Gill Fox, Will Eisner's Shop Talk (Dark Horse, Milwaukie, Oregon, 2001) =Later life= By the late 1960s, Fine lived in Lido Beach, New York, on Long Island, owning two houses there.

Early life Daveiss was born on March 4, 1774, in Bedford County, Virginia. He moved at a young age with his parents to Kentucky, eventually settling near Danville, Kentucky. Admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1795, he appeared in court dressed as a backwoodsman. He served as a second in a duel in 1799, and was for a time a fugitive. Daveiss eventually defended his principal in court, and achieved an acquittal. Career as lawyer Daveiss is said to have been the first lawyer west of the Appalachian Mountains to argue a case before the United States Supreme Court. He married Chief Justice John Marshall's sister Nancy, and returned to Kentucky. Daveiss served as United States Attorney for Kentucky. He has been described as a \\"Kentucky Federalist\\". In February and March, 1806, he wrote President Thomas Jefferson several letters warning him of possible conspiratorial activities by Aaron Burr. Daveiss's July 14 letter to Jefferson stated flatly that Burr planned to provoke a rebellion in Spanish-held parts of the West in order to join them to areas in the Southwest to form an independent nation under his rule. Similar accusations were appearing against local Democratic-Republicans in a Frankfort, Kentucky newspaper, Western World, and Jefferson dismissed Daveiss's accusations against Burr, a Democratic-Republican, as politically motivated. In 1806, Daveiss brought treason charges against Burr in Kentucky. The charges were, however, dismissed thanks to the help of Burr's attorney, Henry Clay. Battle of Tippecanoe In 1811, Daveiss volunteered to serve in the Indiana militia, answering Governor Harrison's call for troops to march against Tecumseh's village at Prophetstown. He was placed in command of two companies of dragoons, and all the cavalry in Harrison's army. On the night of November 6, 1811, Harrison's army made camp near Prophetstown. Major Daveiss' dragoons occupied a position in the rear of the left flank. The dragoons were instructed to fight dismounted, with pistols, as a reserve in the event of a night attack. When the Indians attacked early the next morning, Major Daveiss advanced toward the heaviest fire with a small detachment. He was driven back, and mortally wounded in the process. He died soon after. At the time of the Battle of Tippecanoe, Daveiss was serving as the eighth Grand Master of Masons of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. He was a member of Lexington Lodge #1.

KLTH gradually segued into a format called \\"New Adult Contemporary,\\" an early predecessor to the Smooth Jazz format, and re-branded as \\"Breeze 97.\\" On August 2, 1989, the station was sold once again, and the new owners flipped the station to Top 40 as \\"Hot 97\\" with the call letters KHTK.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-07-28.pdfhttps://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-08-04.pdf The Top 40 format ended when then-rival WKBQ was briefly under lease by the station's owner Saul Frischling of Pittsburgh, and both top 40 stations were merged at 106.5, taking personalities from both stations. On November 11, 1992, KHTK changed call letters to KXOK-FM, and flipped to Urban AC as \\"Mix 97.1\\", after the Urban Oldies format from the former KXOK (630 AM) was moved to FM.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-11-13.pdfhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-11-20.pdf \\"Mix\\" would try to compete with the Urban AC leader in St. Louis, KMJM-FM (\\"Majic 108\\"). The two stations simulcasted briefly before the AM was taken off the air completely, pending a sale to a religious broadcaster. In 1998, Frischling sold KXOK to the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owned ABC affiliate KDNL-TV. In September of that year, the Urban format was dropped, and the station began simulcasting KPNT. On September 25, KXOK began stunting with a 48-hour loop of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses. Two days later, KXOK switched formats to classic rock as \\"The Rock\\" while retaining the KXOK-FM call letters.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-10-02.pdf The station enjoyed the most success seen on the frequency to that date as a competitor to Emmis Communications' KSHE. In the fall of 2000, Emmis Communications added to its St. Louis radio portfolio by purchasing properties from Sinclair Broadcasting, which wanted to focus on its television properties. The sale to Emmis led KXOK and KSHE to become sister stations. Upon purchasing KXOK, and to avoid overlap with KSHE, KXOK changed formats to talk radio on October 16, 2000;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-10-13.pdf the call letters changed to KFTK two days later. Initially, the station focused on a female audience, which included such syndicated personalities as Bob and Sheri, Dr. Joy Browne, Clark Howard, Dr. Laura, Phil Hendrie, Rhona at Night, Loveline, and John and Jeff, as well as local host Dave Glover. The station used the name \\"97.1 FM Talk.\\" Failing to reach much of an audience, the station shifted towards more political talk in 2002, adding such talkers as Don Imus, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity. The station briefly changed its name to \\"97-1 the Link...Real Life Radio\\" but soon returned to the \\"FM Talk\\" moniker. The call sign was modified from KFTK to KFTK-FM on September 8, 2016. On September 15, 2016, KFTK-FM began simulcasting on WQQX, renamed KFTK (1490 AM), and FM translator station K254CR to improve the station's coverage in downtown St. Louis and the Illinois side of the market. The simulcast over KFTK ended on March 20, 2020 when that station's license was cancelled by the commission, after it was revealed that the AM station's ownership was a shell corporation that allowed a convicted felon to own it.

The city of Jerusalem is given special status in Jewish religious law. In particular, Jews outside Jerusalem pray facing its direction, and the maaser sheni, revai and First Fruits must be eaten in Jerusalem. Any expansion of the city for these purposes must be approved by the Sanhedrin. Also, when the Temple in Jerusalem was standing, Jerusalem observed special laws regarding the Four Species on Sukkot, and the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. Jerusalem has long been embedded into Jewish religious consciousness. Jews have studied and personalized the struggle by King David to capture Jerusalem and his desire to build the Jewish temple there, as described in the Book of Samuel and the Book of Psalms. Many of King David's yearnings about Jerusalem have been adapted into popular prayers and songs. Jerusalem appears in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) 669 times and Zion (which usually means Jerusalem, sometimes the Land of Israel) appears 154 times. The first section, the Torah, only mentions Moriah, the mountain range believed to be the location of the binding of Isaac and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and in later parts of the Tanakh the city is written explicitly. The Tanakh (or Old Testament), is a text sacred to both Judaism and Christianity. In Judaism it is considered the Written Law, the basis for the Oral Law (Mishnah, Talmud and Shulkhan Arukh) studied, practiced and treasured by Jews and Judaism for three millennia.List of Jewish prayers and blessings The Talmud elaborates in great depth the Jewish connection with the city.

Many members of the Ultra-Orthodox Community travel to and live in Jerusalem In Christianity In Christian faith, Jerusalem's place in the life of Jesus gives it great importance, in addition to its place in the Old Testament. Jerusalem is the place where Jesus was brought as a child, to be \\"presented\\" at the Temple (Luke 2:22) and to attend festivals (Luke 2:41). According to the Gospels, Jesus preached and healed in Jerusalem, especially in the Temple courts. There is also an account of Jesus' \\"cleansing\\" of the Temple, chasing various traders out of the sacred precincts (Mark 11:15). At the end of each of the Gospels, there are accounts of Jesus' Last Supper in an \\"upper room\\" in Jerusalem, his arrest in Gethsemane, his trial, his crucifixion at Golgotha, his burial nearby and his resurrection and ascension.

In Christianity, the Jewish connection with the city is considered as the account of God's relationship with His chosen people‚Äîthe original covenant‚Äîand the essential prelude to the events narrated in the New Testament, including both universal commandments (e.g. the Ten Commandments) and obsolete or Judaism- specific ones. In medieval times, Christians thought Jerusalem was the center of the world (Latin: umbilicus mundi, Greek: Omphalos), and was so represented in the so-called T and O maps. Byzantine hymns speak of the Cross being \\"planted in the center of the earth,\\" and the imagery is tied to the concept of the Death and resurrection of Jesus being for the benefit of all mankind. Medieval maps of Europe usually placed the east (\\"orient\\")‚ÄîJerusalem‚Äîat the top, and this arrangement led to the use of the term \\"to orient\\" to mean to align a map with actual compass directions.

Islamic tradition holds that previous prophets were associated with the city, and that the Islamic prophet Muhammad visited the city on a nocturnal journey (Isra and Mi'raj). Due to such significance, it was the first Qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims and the prophet Muhammad designated the Al-Aqsa for pilgrimage. Born in 570 AD, Muhammad is believed by Muslims to be a messenger for God.\\"Muhammad.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition.

The Dome of the Rock is an Islamic sacred shrine in Jerusalem, built on the Temple Mount.

Muhammad is believed to have been taken by the miraculous steed Buraq to visit Jerusalem, where he prayed, and then to visit heaven, in a single night in the year 610. Jerusalem is not directly mentioned by name in the Qur'an, nor is it mentioned by its Arabic translation (Al Quds). However, the Qur'anic verse (17:1) is interpreted by Islamic tafsirs (commentaries) as referring to this journey, with the term \\"the farthest Mosque\\" (al-masjid al-Aqsa) referring to the Noble Sanctuary in Jerusalem, where the mosque stands. There he meets other prophets (in particular, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus).Brooke Olson Vuckovic. Heavenly journeys, earthly concerns (2004). Routledge. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is specified of being in Jerusalem as per numerous hadith: > Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: \\"Then he heard Allah's Apostle saying, \\"When > the people of Quraish did not believe me (i.e. the story of my Night > Journey), I stood up in Al-Hijr and Allah displayed Jerusalem in front of > me, and I began describing Jerusalem to them while I was looking at it.\\" > Sahih Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 58, Number 226. Part of Jerusalem's significance and holiness to Muslims derives from its strong association with Abraham, David, Solomon, and Jesus. They are all regarded as Prophets of Islam and their stories are mentioned in the Qur'an. Jerusalem served as the first qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims. Whilst Muslims were in Mecca, and also for 17‚Äì18 months in Medina, Muslims prayed towards Jerusalem. Early mosques in Medina were built to face Jerusalem. In 625, the qibla was changed to the Kaaba in Mecca. After Muhammad, many of his Companions lived in Jerusalem, and upon their death they were buried there.Significance of Jerusalem to Jews and Christians , IslamOnline, July 10, 2002. In Mandaeism In Mandaeism (an ancient Gnostic-like non-Christian religion, once significant in numbers but now a small group found primarily in parts of southern Iran and Iraq), Jerusalem is considered a city of wickedness, dedicated to the god of Judaism, whom they call Adunay (Adonai) or Yurba (possibly YHWH) and consider to be an evil spirit. According to Sidra d-Yahia 54, Jerusalem is \\"the stronghold that Adunay built ... [he] brought to it falsehood in plenty, and it meant persecution against my tarmidia (Manda d-Hiia's disciples).\\" In the Ginza Rba (15.11), it is said to have come into being as a result of the incestuous union of the seven planets with their evil mother Ruha d-Qudsha, meaning Holy Spirit, who \\"left lewdness, perversion, and fornication in it. They said: 'Whoever lives in the city of Jerusalem will not mention the name of God. (Elsewhere, however, it more prosaically says the city was built by Solomon.) However, Yahya (John the Baptist), an important figure in the religion, is said to have been born there.

After two years at Fairbridge he went to Perth to work on a poultry farm, then ticket writing until 1937 when he entered Perth Bible Institute. In 1938 at the age of 21 he went to the siding of Badjaling in the Western Australian wheatbelt as a school teacher for the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) and in those early days started to take an interest in the language of the Noongar people who lived at Badjaling. After a period in the Australian Army from 1941‚Äì45, working at Hollywood Military Hospital, Karrakatta Military Camp and Rottnest, he went to Gnowangerup Mission then in 1945 married Elizabeth Weir. The following year after the birth of their son, John, they went to the Kimberley, and it was at Sunday Island that Wilf attempted to translate verses from the Bible into the Bardi language. This struggling attempt, initially with John 3:16, led to a long association with the Wycliffe Bible Translators through their annual Summer Institute of Linguistics and a lifetime of Bible translation and detailed study of Aboriginal languages. After he undertook some linguistic studies at Sydney University, an opportunity arose in 1951 for the Douglas family to go to Ooldea on the Transline in South Australia to do language work with the UAM. Here he worked for the first time with speakers of the Western Desert Language and produced a phonology and grammar. A year later they moved to Warburton Ranges and during this time their second son Robert was born. It was here that he produced his works Introduction to the Western Desert Language (pub. Sydney Uni 1957) and his Illustrated Topical Dictionary of the Western Desert Language (1959). Wilf's concern for the establishment of an indigenous Church with a Bible in its own language became a central factor in his work, leading to the establishment in 1955 of the Western Desert Bible School and Translation Centre at Mt Margaret. In 1957 the family moved to Kalgoorlie and the following year Wilf established the UAM Language Department which he headed up for another 24 years, until the establishment of the Aboriginal-run Ngaanyatjarra Bible Project. The Language Department provided oversight of Bible translators in the Western Desert and Kimberley regions of Western Australia and led to opportunities for many hundreds of people in these regions to read and understand the Bible in their own language. Douglas continued his work with the Noongar language and in 1968 he published his The Aboriginal Languages of the South-West of Australia (AIAS press). He also carried out work in the Geraldton region on Wajarri (which he spelled 'Watjarri'). In 2002, the Bible Society in Australia presented him with the Elizabeth Macquarrie Award for his contribution to Bible translation. Douglas continued his work throughout his life, continuing work on a new edition of his Illustrated Dictionary of the South West Language until just before his death.

It is the sequel to Age of Sail. It has similar historically accurate game play, and is enhanced with 3D graphics and a free-floating camera. Unlike the original Age of Sail, the sequel's maps are embellished with strategic landmasses. Age of Sail II accurately portrays the mighty fighting ships from 1775 to 1820, and has a realistic combat engine. You can play its campaign which includes a full career ladder, or play one of the 100+ historical scenarios. The game also includes a map editor allowing players to create custom scenarios. A stand-alone expansion, titled Age of Sail II: Privateer's Bounty, was released in 2002. Gameplay The gameplay of Age of Sail II features a minimap, helm, and lists of vessels in play. The player controls one or more vessels each with a specified number of cannons, health, and sails. There are also controls for speed of the gameplay. To achieve victory, the player must either cause the enemy ships to surrender, or simply sink them. Damage inflicted on a vessel is determined by the type of shots fired (round, chain, grape, canister), and the target (hull/sail). Each fire also inflicts damage on the ship's crew. Canister shots are made specifically to inflict damage on crew members. The fewer men aboard a ship, the higher chance for the ship to surrender. Speed of activities such as manoeuvring the sails, repairing damage, and cannon reload speed are also affected. The game was accused by reviewers of the time of having an overcomplicated and sometimes downright broken interface, with unnecessary complication when directing crews to perform the various actions to keep a vessel in operation. The 3-D game engine also came in for criticism, occasionally running as slowly as four frames per second in large fleet actions.

He succeeded Cleghorn in 1859 and remained Chief Conservator until 1882. Botanist, herpetologist, malacologist He became a member of the University of Madras in 1880. He made many floral studies in India and Ceylon, including Trees of the Madras Presidency in 1863 and Handbook of the Ferns of British India, Ceylon and Malaya Peninsula in 1892. He also studied reptiles, amphibians, and molluscs. Colonel Beddome was essentially a botanist. In the study of the flora of South India, he devoted the best days of his life. The result was the publication of a series of valuable works containing figures of many species. The drawings were executed with great accuracy by the native draughtsmen he had trained to draw. His botanical publications included The Flora Sylvatica for Southern India, 1869‚Äì73; Ferns of Southern India, 1873; Ferns of British India, 1876; Forester's Manual of Botany for Southern India, 1869‚Äì74; Icones Plantarum Indies Orientalis, 1874. On Reptilia and Batrachia, he wrote at least 15 papers, and described over 40 new species of reptiles\\"Beddome\\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. and amphibians.\\"Beddome\\".

The case had sparked an intense national debate as to the ethics of what was claimed as a mercy killing. In its decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the crime could not be justified through the defence of necessity, and found that, despite the special circumstances of the case, the lengthy prison sentence given to Latimer was not cruel and unusual and therefore not a breach of section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court also ruled that Latimer was not denied rights to jury nullification, as no such rights exist. The prison sentence was thus upheld, although the Court specifically noted that the federal government had the power to pardon him. Background The Supreme Court described the background this way: Robert Latimer's daughter, Tracy Latimer, was 12 years old and had cerebral palsy. As a result, she was quadriplegic, could not speak, and had the mental abilities of an infant. However, she was not dying of her disability. It was also believed that a feeding tube could help her health, but her parents believed such a medical device would be \\"intrusive\\". Thus, numerous surgeries were performed, and after the scheduling of another surgery in 1993, her father, who viewed the upcoming operation as also being cruel, \\"formed the view that his daughter's life was not worth living\\". He proceeded to poison her with carbon monoxide. When the police made the discovery, Latimer denied responsibility but later admitted he had killed her. He was convicted of second degree murder, but in R v Latimer,[1997] 1 SCR 217. the Supreme Court overturned that finding due to the Crown's improper actions at the jury selection stage. In the subsequent second trial, Latimer was again convicted of second degree murder, but he was sentenced to only one year in prison rather than the minimum ten under the Criminal Code, since in the circumstances of the case, ten years was viewed as cruel and unusual. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal later increased the sentence to ten years. Latimer eventually appealed the case to the Supreme Court, arguing not only that the sentence was too long, but also that the trial was unfair because the judge decided the defence of necessity could not be argued even though this decision came only after the defence had argued it. It was also claimed the judge had misled the jury into thinking that they could influence the length of the sentence. Since many in the jury wished for a lighter sentence than that prescribed by the Criminal Code, it was argued the jury might have resorted to jury nullification had they known they could not decide the length of the sentence. Decision The decision upholding the ten-year sentence was unanimous and was written by The Court. =Defence of necessity= The Court first held that not only was the defence of necessity unable to justify Latimer's actions but also the inapplicability of the defence should have been so obvious that his lawyers should have anticipated its rejection, and therefore the fact that judge rejected it only after the defence was argued was not unfair. The Court first cited precedent that the defence of necessity is invoked only where \\"true 'involuntariness' is present\\". This involves being confronted with a serious danger, no other options but to commit a crime to avoid that danger, and \\"proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided.\\" While the Court acknowledged that the individual's subjective views in measuring approaching dangers and other options could be taken into account, along with an objective assessment (this was called a \\"modified objective test\\"), in this case the defence of necessity failed. First, the claimed danger being avoided, the surgery, threatened not Mr. Latimer but his daughter. Moreover, the Court wrote that \\"ongoing pain did not constitute an emergency in this case\\". The Court believed Mr. Latimer should have been able to understand this, especially since there were alternatives to surgery, such as the feeding tube. The Court went on to find that Latimer had other alternatives to killing his daughter, namely that \\"he could have struggled on\\", albeit \\"with what was unquestionably a difficult situation\\". The Court also ruled that subjective views could not influence an assessment whether the crime is worse, equal or lesser than the threatened danger to the criminal, since \\"fundamental principles of the criminal law\\" would be sacrificed. In this case, the rights of the disabled, based in section 15 of the Charter, were considered to be the important factor in considering how serious the crime was. The Court had difficulties in deciding whether any type of emergency could justify homicide, and at any rate found Tracy's death was worse than the pain Tracy might have felt during life. =Jury nullification= The Court went on to reject the argument that the trial was unfair because the chances of jury nullification were impaired by the judge. As the Court argued, there is no right to a trial in which one's chances of jury nullification are not impaired. Indeed, the justice system is not supposed to advocate jury nullification. Moreover, the judge's apparent suggestion that the jury might have some influence in determining the sentence was not considered misleading or unfair because, while juries cannot decide sentences, they can indeed make recommendations. =Section 12= Finally, the Court rejected the argument that the minimum ten-year sentence might be so long as to be cruel and unusual and thus unconstitutional under section 12 of the Charter. Since a section 12 test demands consideration of the seriousness of the crime, the Court pointed out that the crime led to the \\"most serious of all possible consequences, namely, the death of the victim, Tracy Latimer\\". Consideration of the mens rea of the offence therefore guided the Court to argue that even though Latimer had been convicted of second as opposed to first-degree murder, \\"second degree murder is an offence accompanied by an extremely high degree of criminal culpability\\". At this point, the Court, in balancing other factors in the case, namely how Mr. Latimer had planned his crime and did not regret it, and conversely, how he was distressed over Tracy's condition and was otherwise respected, did not find that any of the positive factors outweighed the crime. Moreover, the punishment was also considered by the Court to be valid because it might discourage others from taking similar actions.

Immensely popular in his own lifetime, he fell into neglect almost immediately upon his death, with the result that now, four hundred years later, it's often extremely difficult to distinguish works by the master from copies or from original creations by his most gifted followers. The Tooth Puller The Toothpuller. c. 1607/1608. Pitti Palace, Florence The case in favor of recognizing The Tooth Puller as was first advanced by the scholar Mina Gregori in 1992, and discussed by John Gash in an article in Melita Historica in 1998. On the side of arguments for genuineness, almost every figure in the painting is based on figures in other, genuine, works by Caravaggio, and from such a variety of sources and cities that it's almost inconceivable that any Caravaggisti could have seen them all; the style is typical of Caravaggio's late style, specifically his Maltese stay in 1607/1608; and he had begun his career in Rome with broadly similar genre works. On the other hand, there is no other surviving example of a genre painting by Caravaggio after about 1600, and, of course, there is no mention of the painting ‚Äì or of any late-period genre painting ‚Äì in sources such as Giovanni Bellori, who otherwise seems to have been thorough in seeking out Caravaggio's works. Still Life with Flowers and Fruits Still Life with Flowers and Fruit. 1590s. Borghese Gallery, Rome According to tradition, Caravaggio painted flowers and fruit when he first came to Rome. Individual pieces of this Still Life with Flowers and Fruit are brilliantly painted and call to mind the mastery of such subjects that Caravaggio showed in early works such as Boy with a Basket of Fruit, as well as his reported comment that it took as much trouble to paint a flower as it did to paint a man. Nevertheless, the overall composition is awkward and it is not accepted as genuine. The painting is ascribed to an artist known as the Painter of the Wadsworth Atheneum Still-Life, after a work in the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut. John the Baptist (Basel √ñffentliche Kunstsammlung) John the Baptist. Date unknown. √ñffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basle The John the Baptist from Basel has many of the stylistic marks of Caravaggio ‚Äì the use of deep shadows, the isolated youthful Baptist ‚Äì but is not widely accepted as genuine. A comparison with Carlo Sellitto shows how well the more gifted of Caravaggio's followers absorbed not only the superficial tricks of style but the underlying ethos as well, to the point of becoming virtually indistinguishable from the work of the master. The Basle Baptist, despite being a very attractive painting in its own right, is a quite forthright and traditional piece of Counter-Reformation iconography (the Baptist is holding out roses, symbol of the Passion, before the sheep, representing Christ's future sacrifice), and has none of the deep pathos and ambiguously mingled sensuality and spirituality that Caravaggio brought to his long contemplation of John the Baptist.

Almost 1000 people, mostly Cree, live in the adjacent village of Whapmagoostui. The community is only accessible by air, Kuujjuarapik Airport and, in late summer, by boat. The nearest Inuit village is Umiujaq, about north-northwest of Kuujjuarapik. The police services in Kuujjuaraapik are provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force. Like most other northern villages in Quebec, there is an Inuit reserved land of the same name, Kuujjuarapik. However, unlike most other Inuit reserved lands, the Inuit reserved land of Kuujjuarapik is not adjacent to its eponymous northern village; rather, it is located considerably farther north and in fact borders on the Inuit reserved land of Umiujaq. Although the permanent cohabitation of Inuit and Cree at the mouth of the Great Whale River only goes back to the year 1950, the two Indigenous peoples were rubbing shoulders in this area for a very long time: Inuit close to the coast and the Cree more in the interior lands. History While the Inuit have hunted and fished along the Hudson Bay coast long before the arrival of Europeans, it was not until 1820 when a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) trading post was built there, known variously as Great Whale River House, Great Whale River or just Great Whale. On maps of 1851 and 1854, the post is called Whale River House and Whale House. Protestant and Catholic missions settled there in the 1880s. In 1895, a weather station was set up by the Federal Government. Medical and police services began to be offered in the first half of the 20th century, yet it was not settled permanently and only used as a summer encampment. The official 1901 census count for Great Whale River numbers 216, making note of all the Inuit and their families who lived in the surrounding area and who came to trade at Great Whale River over the course of several months. However, the census taker notes of this official number: \\"I should say it does not represent one-third of the Eskimos, but I am sending on as many (names) as I could obtain.\\" In the late 1930s, the Inuit gave up their nomadic way of life and settled in the village. In 1940, the American army opened a military air base here, using Inuit and Cree workers. In 1941, the HBC post closed. After the Second World War in 1948, the military base was transferred to the Canadian government and in 1955, it began operating a Mid-Canada Line radar station called RCAF Station Great Whale River. Though the radar station was not operational for long and closed in 1965, it established the village permanently. In 1961, when the Quebec Government decided to give French names to Nordic places, the name Great Whale River was replaced with Grande-Baleine which itself was replaced a year later with Poste-de-la-Baleine. When the village was incorporated, it officially adopted its current name, a name the Inuit had already been using for some time to designate this place. Fearing the impact of planned large-scale hydroelectric works on the Great Whale River, a referendum was held in 1982 in which the Inuit decided to relocate to a new village (Umiujaq) some to the north. A large portion of the Inuit moved there in 1986, causing the population of Kuujjuarapik to drop significantly. Climate Predictably, given its northern latitude, Kuujjuarapik has a subarctic climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dsc), but strongly modified by its location on the southeastern (predominantly windward) shore of Hudson Bay, particularly from May/June through November, the primary season when Hudson Bay's surface is unfrozen, i.e. open water. Winters are long and cold; summers are cool, strongly influenced by the chilly open waters of Hudson Bay, with August (the warmest month, on average) mustering an average monthly high temperature of only . Freezing conditions (0 degrees C) have occurred every month of the year. Year-round, climatic conditions are influenced strongly by Hudson Bay's freeze-thaw cycle. January is the coldest month on average; August, the warmest. The average annual precipitation cycle demonstrates a minimum from mid-winter (January) to mid-spring (May), with sharply rising average monthly precipitation amounts beginning in June, reaching a peak in September, but with only slowly falling average monthly precipitation amounts from September to November. As such, compared to most Northern Hemisphere sub-Arctic climates (which usually have strong precipitation maximums between June and August, usually July), Kuujjuarapik demonstrates a strong tendency favouring a relatively drier spring and relatively wetter autumn. This pattern is a direct consequence of Kuujjuarapik's location on the lee shore of Hudson Bay. Similar to a pattern evident in heavily \\"lake-influenced\\" areas around the U.S. Great Lakes (i.e. Holland and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan), in spring and early summer, water temperatures are cooler than those of surrounding land areas, encouraging low clouds and fog, but also stable conditions and less precipitation. In fall and early winter, the pattern is reversed: water temperatures are warmer than those of surrounding land areas, encouraging cumulus cloud formation and unstable conditions, meaning low-pressure systems passing from cooler land to warmer water often intensify. In Kuujjuarapik, this pattern means average monthly precipitation peaks in September - when increasingly cold air masses passing eastward and southeastward across the open waters of Hudson Bay are warmed and destabilized by their over-water passage, producing thick clouds and frequent, often-heavy instability rain (and from October to December, snow) showers. This pattern also results in the heaviest average monthly average snowfall amounts coming from October to January, but concentrated in November and December, with \\"Hudson-Bay effect\\" snows most common, and markedly less average monthly snowfall from February to May. From late November into December, Hudson Bay freezes, and by January, its frozen surface provides little modification to Arctic air masses, and less moisture, i.e. snow, to Kuujjuarapik. Also, because Hudson Bay in the fall is open water into mid to late November when freezing begins, the speed of temperature fall during the autumn months is relatively slight from August to October, and steepest from November to January (by which time the bay is fully frozen over). Overall, Kuujjuarapik's climate is severe and sub-Arctic, but with a relatively slow temperature fall from summer to November due to water influence and delayed freezing of Hudson Bay (late November into December), and a dry spring and wet and stormy fall. Further evidencing these patterns is monthly sunshine data (as a percentage of daylight hours), which shows a marked maximum most months from February to July, and a marked minimum from September to December, when \\"Bay-induced\\" cloud cover is highest; in November, the cloudiest month, average sunshine bottoms out at only 13.5% of available daylight hours. Considering its marine position on the 55th parallel, the climate is extremely cold when compared with cities like Glasgow and Copenhagen in northern Europe and Chinook-affected areas further to the west in Canada's interior.

New York: Arno Press, A New York Times Company (1978) A single volume in the complete set The American Catholic Tradition; . He wrote several works in prose and verse, and was a distinguished lecturer and preacher. Among his many literary works, he wrote three Catholic devotional novels and one semi-fictional work, Letters to Ada. Between 1827-30, he published a five- volume History of the Church from Its Establishment to the Present Century (although the work stopped at the 16th century). In honor of this effort, Pope Gregory XVI made him a knight of the Sacred Palace and Count Palatine, \\"the first time these honors had come to an American.\\" At this point, he was also made a knight of the Holy Roman Empire and was granted a Doctor of Divinity degree by examination. During these years, Pise was an assistant at St. Patrick's Church in Washington, DC. Henry Clay arranged for him to be appointed Chaplain of the Senate. Pise served as Chaplain from 1832-33. Pise was the first (and, to date, only) Roman Catholic United States Senate Chaplain, coming into that office on December 11, 1832. Answering objections to the presence of a Catholic in such a prominent government role, and prefiguring a similar speech by John F. Kennedy more than 125 years later, on July 4, 1833, Pise made \\"an eloquent address\\" before the Maryland House of Delegates describing in what sense he felt an American Roman Catholic owed 'allegiance' to the Pope. In 1849, he was assigned as rector at Saint Charles Borromeo Church in Brooklyn, New York; he died in Brooklyn on May 26, 1866.\\"Pise, Charles Constantine\\", in John Julian (1907), A Dictionary of Hymnology, reprint, New York: Dover, Vol. 2, p. 1687. Appraisal Pise had a career of such prominence that it was unusual he was not made a bishop. One biographer suggests that his friendship with Catholic intellectual Orestes Brownson may have been the problem, at a time when the American Church was turning away from intellectualism as a result of growing Irish domination. Alternatively, the same biographer suggests that it may have been an anti- Irish, anti-Jesuit streak in Ambrose Mar√©chal, Bishop of Baltimore, which led him to suppress this logical cap to Pise's career.

In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) phonological system. Among other things, most dialects have vowel reduction in unstressed syllables and a complex set of phonological features that distinguish fortis and lenis consonants (stops, affricates, and fricatives). This article describes the history phonology of English over time, starting from its roots in proto-Germanic to diverse changes in different dialects of modern English.

Within each subsection, changes are in approximate chronological order. The time periods for some of the early stages are quite short due to the extensive population movements occurring during the Migration Period (early AD), which resulted in rapid dialect fragmentation. =Late Proto-Germanic period= This period includes changes in late Proto-Germanic, up to about the 1st century. Only a general overview of the more important changes is given here; for a full list, see the Proto- Germanic article. * Unstressed word-final and were lost. Early ' > late PGmc ' \\"you carried (sg)\\". * Word-final became . ** Word-final was then lost after unstressed syllables with nasalization of the preceding vowel. Hence *' > early PGmc ' > late PGmc > Old English \\"day (acc. sg.)\\". The nasalisation was retained at least into the earliest history of Old English. * Word-final was lost after an unstressed syllable. This followed the loss of word-final , because it remained before : PrePGmc *' > early PGmc ' > late PGmc ' \\"they carried\\". * was raised to in unstressed syllables. ** The original vowel remained when followed by , and was later lowered to . * Early i-mutation: was raised to when an or followed in the next syllable. ** This occurred before deletion of word-final ; hence *' > early PGmc ' > late PGmc ' > German \\"over\\". Compare PIE *' > early PGmc ' > late PGmc ' > German \\"over\\". ** But it occurred after the raising of unstressed to : PIE *' > PGmc ' > ' \\"you carry (pl)\\". ** This also affected the diphthong , which became . ** As a consequence of this change, > . The Elder Futhark of the Proto-Norse language still contained different symbols for the two sounds. * z-umlaut: is raised to before . ** Early PGmc ' \\"me, dative\\" > late PGmc ' > Old High German mir, Old Saxon mi, Old Norse m√©r (with general lowering and lengthening of i before r). ** This change was only sporadic at best because there were barely any words in which it could have occurred at all, since remained only in stressed syllables. The umlauting effect of remained, however, and in Old West Norse it was extended to other vowels as well. Hence OEN gla Ä, hrau Ä, OWN gler, hreyrr. * Pre-nasal raising: > before nasal + consonant. Pre-PGmc *' > PGmc ' > ' > OE bindan > ModE bind (Latin ). ** This was later extended in Pre-Old English times to vowels before all nasals; hence Old English niman \\"take\\" but Old High German neman. * Loss of before , with nasalization and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. ** The nasalization was eventually lost, but remained through the Ingvaeonic period. ** Hence Pre-PGmc *' > PGmc ' > OE √æencan > ModE think, but PrePG *' > PGmc ' > ' > OE > ModE thought. ** This change followed the raising of before a nasal: PGmc ' > ' > ' > Gothic . * Final-syllable short vowels were generally deleted in words of three syllables or more. PGmc ' > Goth \\"(he) carries\\" (see above), and also PGmc ', ' > ' (dative and instrumental plural ending of nouns, 1st person plural ending of verbs, as on the Stentoften Runestone). =Northwest Germanic period= This was the period that existed after the East Germanic languages had split off. Changes during this time were shared with the North Germanic dialects, i.e. Proto-Norse. Many of the changes that occurred were areal, and took time to propagate throughout a dialect continuum that was already diversifying. Thus, the ordering of the changes is sometimes ambiguous, and can differ between dialects. * Allophonic i-mutation/Germanic umlaut: Short back vowels were fronted when followed in the next syllable by or , by i-mutation: > , > , > ** In this initial stage, the mutated vowels were still allophonically conditioned, and were not yet distinct as phonemes. Only later, when the and were modified or lost, were the new sounds phonemicized. ** i-mutation affected all the Germanic languages except for Gothic, although with a great deal of variation. It appears to have occurred earliest, and to be most pronounced, in the Schleswig-Holstein area (the home of the Anglo-Saxons), and from there to have spread north and south. However, it is possible that this change already occurred in Proto-Germanic proper, in which case the phenomenon would have remained merely allophonic for quite some time. If that is the case, that would be the stage reflected in Gothic, where there is no orthographic evidence of i-mutation at all. ** Long vowels and diphthongs were affected only later, probably analogically, and not in all areas. Notably, they were not mutated in most (western) Dutch dialects, whereas short vowels were. * a-mutation: is lowered to when a non-high vowel follows in the next syllable. ** This is blocked when followed by a nasal followed by a consonant, or by a cluster with in it. Hence PG ' > OE/ModE gold, but PG ' > OE gyldan > ModE gild. ** This produces a new phoneme , due to inconsistent application and later loss of word-final vowels. * Final-syllable long vowels were shortened. ** Final becomes , later raised to . PG ' (\\"saw (tool)\\") > OE sagu, ON s«´g. ** Final becomes in ON (later raised to ), in West Germanic. PG ' (\\"he/she/it healed\\") > ON heil√∞i, but OE h«£lde, OHG heilta. ** The final long diphthong loses its final element and usually develops the same as from that point on. PG ' (\\"gift\\", dative singular) > NWG ' > ON gj«´f, OHG gebu, OE giefe (an apparent irregular development). * \\"Overlong\\" vowels were shortened to regular long vowels. * PG (maybe already by late PG) becomes . This preceded final shortening in West Germanic, but postdated it in North Germanic. * Unstressed diphthongs were monophthongized. > , > . The latter merged with ≈ç from shortened overlong √¥. PG ' (\\"son\\", genitive singular) > NWG ' > ON sonar, OE suna, OHG suno; PG ' (\\"he/she/it take\\", subjunctive) > NWG ' > ON nemi, OE nime, OHG neme; PG ' (\\"stone\\", dative singular) > NWG ' > ON steini, OE , OHG steine. =West Germanic period= This period occurred around the 2nd to 4th centuries. It is unclear if there was ever a distinct \\"Proto-West Germanic\\", as most changes in this period were areal, and likely spread throughout a dialect continuum that was already diversifying further. Thus, this \\"period\\" may not have been a real timespan, but may simply cover certain areal changes that did not reach into North Germanic. This period ends with the further diversification of West Germanic into several groups before and during the Migration Period: Ingvaeonic, Istvaeonic (Old Frankish) and Irminonic (Upper German). * Loss of word-final . ** This change occurred before rhotacization, as original word-final was not lost. ** But it must have occurred after the Northwest Germanic split, since word-final was not eliminated in Old Norse, instead merging with . ** was not lost in single-syllable words in southern and central German. Compare PG ' > OS mi, OE me vs. OHG mir. ** The OE nominative plural (ME ), OS nominative plural may be from original accusative plural ', due to the Ingvaeonic Nasal-Spirant law, rather than original nominative plural ', which would be expected to become *-a (OHG -a, compare ON ). * Rhotacization: > . ** This change also affected Proto-Norse, but only much later. and were still distinct in the Danish and Swedish dialect of Old Norse, as is testified by distinct runes. ( is normally assumed to be a rhotic fricative in this language, but there is no actual evidence of this.) ** PG > Goth ; OE dƒìor > ModE deer * West Germanic gemination: single consonants followed by except became double (geminate). This only affected consonants preceded by a short vowel, because those preceded by a long vowel or by another consonant were never followed by due to Sievers' law. ** PG > OE biddan, habban > ModE bid, have =Ingvaeonic and Anglo-Frisian period= This period is estimated to have lasted only a century or so, the 4th to 5th; the time during which the Franks started to spread south into Gaul (France) and the various coastal people began colonising Britain. Changes in this period affected the Ingvaeonic languages, but not the more southerly Central and Upper German languages. The Ingvaeonic group was probably never homogeneous, but was divided further into Old Saxon and Anglo-Frisian. Old Frankish (and later Old Dutch) was not in the core group, but was affected by the spread of several areal changes from the Ingvaeonic area. The Anglo-Frisian languages shared several unique changes that were not found in the other West Germanic languages. The migration to Britain caused a further split into early Old English and early Old Frisian. * Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law: Loss of nasals before fricatives, with nasalization and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. Hence PG ' became ModG Mund but in Ingvaeonic dialects first became '. Old English then denasalised the vowels, giving OE > ModE \\"mouth\\". ** Following this > . PrePG *' > PG ' > ' > ' > OE > ModE \\"tooth\\". (ModG Zahn < OHG zant.) This also applied to arising earlier in Proto-Germanic: PG ' > Late PG ' > OE > ModE \\"(I) thought\\". * Anglo-Frisian brightening: ** Fronting of to (unless followed by a geminate, by a back vowel in the next syllable, or in certain other cases). Hence OE d√¶ƒ° \\"day\\", plural dagas \\"days\\" (dialectal ModE \\"dawes\\"; compare ModE \\"dawn\\" < OE dagung ). ** This does not affect nasal . And since this is a back vowel, in a preceding syllable was prevented from being fronted as well. This created an alternation between the infinitive in *-anƒÖ and strong past participle in *-ana (< PG *anaz), where the former became -an in OE but the latter became *-√¶n√¶ > -en. ** Fronting of to (generally, unless followed). * Final-syllable , and are lost. ** No attested West Germanic languages show any reflexes of these vowels. However, the way it affected the fronting of as described above shows that at least was retained into the separate history of Anglo-Frisian. =Old English period= This period is estimated to be c. AD 475‚Äì900. This includes changes from the split between Old English and Old Frisian (c. AD 475) up through historic early West Saxon of AD 900: * Breaking of front vowels. ** Most generally, before , and + consonant (assumed to be velarized in these circumstances), but exact conditioning factors vary from vowel to vowel. ** Initial result was a falling diphthong ending in , but this was followed by diphthong height harmonization, producing short , , from short , , , long , , from long , , . *** Written ea, eo, io, where length is not distinguished graphically. ** Result in some dialects, for example Anglian, was back vowels rather than diphthongs. West Saxon ceald; but Anglian cald > ModE cold. * Diphthong height harmonization: The height of one element of each diphthong is adjusted to match that of the other. ** > through this change, possibly through an intermediate stage . PG ' > OE > ModE stone. ** was first fronted to and then harmonized to . PG ' > OE ' \\"joy\\" (cf. ModE dream, ModG Traum). PG ' > OE > ModE death (Goth , ModG Tod). PG ' > OE ' > ModE eye (Goth , ModG Auge). ** is harmonized to . * A-restoration: Short is backed to when a back vowel follows in the next syllable. ** This produces alternations such as OE d√¶ƒ° \\"day\\", pl. dagas (cf. dialectal dawes \\"days\\"). * Palatalization of velar consonants: were palatalized to in certain complex circumstances. A similar palatalization happened in Frisian, but by this point the languages had split up; the Old English palatalization must be ordered after Old-English-specific changes such as a-restoration. ** Generally, the velar stops were palatalized before or ; after when not before a vowel; and was palatalized at the beginning of a word before front vowels. (At this point, there was no word-initial .) ** was palatalized in somewhat broader circumstances: By any following front vowel, as well as by a preceding front vowel when a vowel did not immediately follow the . ** later becomes , but not before the loss of older below. ** is palatalized in almost all circumstances. PG ' > ModE ship (cf. skipper < Dutch schipper, where no such change happened), but West Frisian skip. PG ' > OE scyrte > ModE shirt, but > ON skyrt > ModE skirt. An example of retained is PG ' > OE ascian > ModE ask; there is evidence that OE ascian was sometimes rendered metathetized to acsian, which is the presumed origin of ModE ask. * Palatal diphthongization: Initial palatal , , trigger spelling changes of a > ea, e > ie. It is disputed whether this represents an actual sound change or merely a spelling convention indicating the palatal nature of the preceding consonant (written g, c, sc were ambiguous in OE as to palatal , , and velar or , , , respectively). ** Similar changes of o > eo, u > eo are generally recognized to be merely a spelling convention. Hence WG > OE geong > ModE \\"young\\"; if geong literally indicated an diphthong, the modern result would be *yeng. ** It is disputed whether there is Middle English evidence of the reality of this change in Old English. * i-mutation: The most important change in the Old English period. All back vowels were fronted before a in the next syllable, and front vowels were raised. ** > (but > before or ); ** > > ; ** > ; ** , > > ; this also applied to the equivalent short diphthongs. ** Short > by an earlier pan-Germanic change under the same circumstances; often conflated with this change. ** This had dramatic effects in inflectional and derivational morphology, e.g. in noun paradigms (f≈çt \\"foot\\", pl. fƒìt \\"feet\\"); verb paradigms (bacan \\"to bake\\", b√¶c√æ \\"he bakes\\"); nominal derivatives from adjectives (strang \\"strong\\", streng√æ(u) \\"strength\\"), from verbs (cuman \\"to come\\", cyme \\"coming\\"), and from other nouns (fox \\"fox\\", fyxenn \\"vixen\\"); verbal derivatives (f≈çda \\"food\\", fƒìdan \\"to feed\\"); comparative adjectives (eald \\"old\\", ieldra \\"older, elder\\"). Many echoes of i-mutation are still present in the modern language. * Close-vowel loss: Loss of word-final and (also from earlier ) except when following a short syllable (i.e. one with a short vowel followed by a single consonant.) For example, PIE *' > PG ' > OE sunu \\"son (nom. sing.)\\", PIE *' > PG ' > OE feohu \\"cattle (nom. sing.)\\", PIE *' > PG ' > OE ∆øine \\"friend (nom. sing.)\\", but PrePG *' > PG ' > WG ' > OE \\"foot (nom. pl.)\\". * Loss of and following a long syllable. ** A similar change happened in the other West Germanic languages, although after the earliest records of those languages. ** This did not affect the new (< ) formed from palatalisation of PG , suggesting that it was still a palatal fricative at the time of the change. For example, PG ' > early OE *' > OE ∆ørƒìƒ°an (). ** Following this, PG occurred only word-initially and after (which was the only consonant that was not geminated by and hence retained a short syllable). * H-loss: Proto-Germanic is lost between vowels, and between and a vowel. The preceding vowel is lengthened. ** This leads to alternations such as eoh \\"horse\\", pl. ƒìos, and ∆øealh \\"foreigner\\", pl. ∆øƒìalas. * Vowel assimilation: Two vowels in hiatus merge into a long vowel. ** Some examples come from h-loss. Others come from loss of or between vowels, e.g. PG frij≈çndz > OE frƒ´ond > frƒìond \\"friend\\"; PG saiwimiz \\"sea (dat. pl.)\\" > *s«£∆øum > OE s«£m. * Back mutation: Short e, i and (in Mercian only) a are sometimes broken to short eo, io, and ea when a back vowel follows in the next syllable. ** Hence seofon \\"seven\\" < PG *sebun, mioluc, meoluc \\"milk\\" < PG *meluks. * Palatal umlaut: Short e, eo, io become i (occasionally ie) before hs, ht. ** Hence riht \\"right\\" (cf. German recht), siex \\"six\\" (cf. German sechs). * Vowel reductions in unstressed syllables: ** became in final syllables, but usually appears as o in medial syllables (although a and u both appear). ** and (if not deleted by high-vowel loss) became in final syllables. ** normally became in a final syllable except when absolutely word-final. ** In medial syllables, short are deleted; short are deleted following a long syllable but usually remain following a short syllable (except in some present-tense verb forms), merging to in the process; and long vowels are shortened. * are unrounded to , respectively. This occurred within the literary period. ** Some Old English dialects retained the rounded vowels, however. * Early pre-cluster shortening: Vowels were shortened when falling immediately before either three consonances or the combination of two consonants and two additional syllables in the word. ** Thus, OE gƒÅst > ModE ghost, but OE gƒÉstliƒã > ModE ghastly (ƒÅ > ƒÉ/_CCC) and OE crƒ´st > ModE Christ, but OE crƒ≠stesm√¶sse > ModE Christmas (ƒ´ > ƒ≠/_CC$$). ** Probably occurred in the seventh century as evidenced by eighth century Anglo- Saxon missionaries' translation into Old Low German, \\"Gospel\\" as Gotspel, lit. \\"God news\\" not expected *Guotspel, \\"Good news\\" due to g≈çdspell > g≈èdspell. * and were lowered to and between 800 and 900 AD. * Initial became in late Old English. This occurred within the literary period, as evidenced by shifting patterns in alliterative verse. =Until Middle English= This period is estimated to be c. 900‚Äì1400. * Homorganic lengthening: Vowels were lengthened before , , , , probably also , , , when not followed by a third consonant or two consonants and two syllables. ** This probably occurred around AD 1000. ** Later on, many of these vowels were shortened again; but evidence from the Ormulum shows that this lengthening was once quite general. ** Remnants persist in the Modern English pronunciations of words such as child (but not children, since a third consonant follows), field (plus yield, wield, shield), old (but not alderman as it is followed by at least two syllables), climb, find (plus mind, kind, bind, etc.), long and strong (but not length and strength), fiend, found (plus hound, bound, etc.). * Pre-cluster shortening: Vowels were shortened when followed by two or more consonants, except when lengthened as above. ** This occurred in two stages, the first stage occurring already in late Old English and affecting only vowels followed by three or more consonants, or two or more consonants when two syllables followed (an early form of trisyllabic laxing). * Diphthong smoothing: Inherited height- harmonic diphthongs were monophthongized by the loss of the second component, with the length remaining the same. ** and initially became and . ** and initially became and . * Middle English stressed vowel changes: ** (from Old English ) and became and , respectively. ** (from Old English ) and merged into . ** New front-rounded and (from Old English ) were unrounded to and . ** and were unrounded to and . * became or , depending on surrounding vowels. * New diphthongs formed from vowels followed by or (including from former ). ** Length distinctions were eliminated in these diphthongs, yielding diphthongs plus borrowed from French. ** Middle English breaking: Diphthongs also formed by the insertion of a glide or (after back and front vowels, respectively) preceding . * Mergers of new diphthongs: ** Early on, high-mid diphthongs were raised: merged with (hence eye < OE ƒìƒ°e rhymes with rye < *riƒ°e < OE ryƒ°e), merged with and merged with (hence rue < OE hrƒìo∆øan rhymes with hue < OE hƒ´∆ø and new < OE nƒ´∆øe). ** In Late Middle English, and merge as , so that vain and vein are homophones (the vein‚Äìvain merger). * Trisyllabic laxing: Shortening of stressed vowels when two syllables followed. ** This results in pronunciation variants in Modern English such as divine vs divinity and south vs. southern (OE s≈´√∞erne). * Middle English open syllable lengthening: Vowels were usually lengthened in open syllables (13th century), except when trisyllabic laxing would apply. * Reduction and loss of unstressed vowels: Remaining unstressed vowels merged into . ** Starting around 1400 AD, is lost in final syllables. * Initial clusters , , were reduced by loss of . * Voiced fricatives became independent phonemes through borrowing and other sound changes. * before back vowel becomes ; becomes . ** Modern English sword, answer, lamb. ** in swore is due to analogy with swear. * The cluster, present in words imported from Norman, is deaffricated, and merges with (which had perhaps been apical in medieval times, as in closely related Dutch and Low German), thus merging sell and cell. ** But unlike French, and are fully preserved. =Up to Shakespeare's English= This period is estimated to be c. AD 1400‚Äì1600. * H-loss completed: (written gh) lost in most dialects, so that e.g. taught and taut become homophones, likewise bow (meaning \\"bend\\") and bough. * and when not followed by a vowel undergo mutations: ** Before , a coronal consonant or word-finally, they are diphthongized to and . (By later changes, they become and , as in modern salt, tall, bolt, roll.) After this, the combinations and lose their in most accents, affecting words like talk, caulk, and folk. Words acquired after this change (such as talc) were not affected. ** Before , the becomes silent, so that half and calf are pronounced with , and salve and halve are pronounced with . is exempt, so that solve keeps its . is not wholly exempt, as the traditional pronunciation of golf was . ** Before , become , as in alms, balm, calm, palm; Holmes. ** Some words have irregular pronunciations, e.g. from non-standard dialects (salmon) or spelling pronunciations (falcon in American English). * Short develop into lax * Great Vowel Shift; all long vowels raised or diphthongized. ** become , respectively. ** become , respectively. ** become or , later and . ** New developed from old (see below). *** Thus, effectively rotated in-place. ** are shifted again to in Early Modern English, causing merger of former with ; but the two are still distinguished in spelling as ea, ee. * Initial cluster reductions: ** merges into ; hence rap and wrap become homophones. * Doubled consonants reduced to single consonants. * Loss of most remaining diphthongs. ** became , merging with the vowel in broad and the of the lot‚Äìcloth split below. ** The long mid mergers: are raised to , eventually merging with , so that pane and pain, and toe and tow, become homophones in most accents. ** The above two mergers did not occur in many regional dialects as late as the 20th century (e.g. Northern England, East Anglia, South Wales, and even Newfoundland). ** merge to , so that dew (EME < OE dƒìa∆ø), duke (EME < Old French duc ) and new (EME < OE nƒ´∆øe) now have the same vowel. *** This later becomes in standard varieties of English, and in some cases through yod- dropping. *** remains in Welsh English and some other non-standard varieties. ** and merge to , the only Middle English diphthong that remains in the modern standard English varieties. =Up to the American‚ÄìBritish split= This period is estimated to be c. AD 1600‚Äì1725. * At some preceding time after Old English, all become . ** Evidence from Old English shows that, at that point, the pronunciation occurred only before a consonant. ** Scottish English has consistently. * Initial cluster reductions: ** both merge into ; hence gnat and Nat become homophones; likewise not and knot. * The foot‚Äìstrut split: In southern England, becomes unrounded and eventually lowered unless preceded by a labial and followed by a non-velar. This gives put but cut and buck . This distinction later become phonemicized by an influx of words shortened from to both before (flood, blood, glove) and after (good, hood, book, soot, took) this split. * Ng-coalescence: Reduction of in most areas produces new phoneme . * In some words, coalesce to produce , and the new phoneme , a sound change known as yod-coalescence, a type of palatalization: nature, mission, procedure, vision. ** These combinations mostly occurred in borrowings from French and Latin. ** Pronunciation of -tion was from Old French , thus becoming . ** This sound mutation still occurs allophonically in Modern English: did you ‚Üí didjou. * Long vowels , from ME , inconsistently shortened, especially before : sweat, head, bread, breath, death, leather, weather ** Shortening of occurred at differing time periods, both before and after the centralizing of to ; hence blood versus good : also foot, soot, blood, good. * The meet‚Äìmeat merger: Meet and meat become homophones in most accents. * Changes affect short vowels in many varieties before an at the end of a word or before a consonant ** as in start and as in north are lengthened. ** merge before , so all varieties of ModE except for some Scottish English and some Irish English have the same vowel in fern, fir and fur. ** Also affects vowels in derived forms, so that starry no longer rhymes with marry. * , as in cat and trap, fronted to in many areas. In certain other words it becomes , for example father . is actually a new phoneme deriving from this and words like calm (see above). ** Most varieties of northern English English, Welsh English and Scottish English retain in cat, trap etc. * The lot‚Äìcloth split: in some varieties, lengthening of before voiced velars (, ) (American English only) and voiceless fricatives (, , ). Hence American English long, dog, loss, cloth, off with (except in dialects with the cot‚Äìcaught merger where the split is made completely mute). * becomes in many words spelt oo: for example, book, wool, good, foot.

Examples of sound changes  Summary of vowel developments =Development of Middle English vowels= Monophthongs This table describes the main historical developments of English vowels in the last 1000 years, beginning with late Old English and focusing on the Middle English and Modern English changes leading to the current forms. It provides a lot of detail about the changes taking place in the last 600 years (since Middle English), while omitting any detail in the Old English and earlier periods. For more detail about the changes in the first millennium AD, see the section on the development of Old English vowels. This table omits the history of Middle English diphthongs; see that link for a table summarizing the developments. The table is organized around the pronunciation of Late Middle English c. 1400 AD (the time of Chaucer) and the modern spelling system, which dates from the same time and closely approximates the pronunciation of the time. Modern English spelling originates in the spelling conventions of Middle English scribes and its modern form was largely determined by William Caxton, the first English printer (beginning in 1476). As an example, the vowel spelled corresponds to two Middle English pronunciations: in most circumstances, but long in an open syllable, i.e. followed by a single consonant and then a vowel, notated aCV in the spelling column. (This discussion ignores the effect of trisyllabic laxing.) The lengthened variant is due to the Early Middle English process of open-syllable lengthening; this is indicated by (leng.). Prior to that time, both vowels were pronounced the same, as a short vowel ; this is reflected by the fact that there is a single merged field corresponding to both Middle English sounds in the Late Old English column (the first column). However, this earlier Middle English vowel is itself the merger of a number of different Anglian Old English sounds: # the short vowels indicated in Old English spelling as , and ; # the long equivalents , , and often when directly followed by two or more consonants (indicated by ƒÅ+CC, «£+CC, etc.); # occasionally, the long vowel when directly followed by two consonants, particularly when this vowel corresponded to West Saxon Old English . (Middle English, and hence Modern English, largely derives from the Anglian dialect of Old English, but some words are derived from the West Saxon dialect of Old English, because the border between the two dialects ran through the London area. The West Saxon dialect, not the Anglian dialect, is the \\"standard\\" dialect described in typical reference works on Old English.) Moving forward in time, the two Middle English vowels and correspond directly to the two vowels and , respectively, in the Early Modern English of c. 1600 AD (the time of Shakespeare). However, each vowel has split into a number of different pronunciations in Modern English, depending on the phonological context. The short , for example, has split into seven different vowels, all still spelled but pronounced differently: # when not in any of the contexts indicated below, as in man, sack, wax, etc. # A vowel pronounced in General American (GA) and in Received Pronunciation (RP) when preceded by and not followed by the velar consonants , as in swan, wash, wallow, etc. (General American is the standard pronunciation in the U.S. and Received Pronunciation is the most prestigious pronunciation in Britain. In both cases, these are the pronunciations typically found in news broadcasts and among the middle and upper classes.) # (GA) or (RP) when followed by a written , as in hard, car, etc. (This does not include words like care, where the was pronounced as long in Middle English.) # But (GA) or (RP) when both preceded by and followed by written , as in war, swarm, etc. # when followed by an plus either a consonant or the end of a word, as in small, walk, etc. (In the case of walk, talk, chalk, etc. the has dropped out, but this is not indicated here. Words like rally, shallow and swallow are not covered here because the is followed by a vowel; instead, earlier rules apply. Nor are words like male covered, which had long in Middle English.) # when followed by , as in palm, calm, etc. (The has dropped out in pronunciation.) # In RP only, the pronunciation is often found when followed by an unvoiced fricative, i.e. , or (but not ), as in glass, after, path, etc. This does not apply to GA and also unpredictably does not affect a number of words of the same form, e.g. crass, math, etc. Diphthongs This table describes the main developments of Middle English diphthongs, starting with the Old English sound sequences that produced them (sequences of vowels and g, h or ∆ø) and ending with their Modern English equivalents.

CG stand for Cash Guarantee. It was in production from 1976 to 2008 in Japan and has been in production since 1992 in Pakistan. The CG was originally manufactured in Japan, but the source for the European market was eventually moved to Brazil in 1985, and to Pakistan in 1992 and to Turkey for the W and M models. The CG125 is powered by a four-stroke, overhead valve, single-cylinder engine that has changed little over the years. In Pakistan the original CG125 is still being produced by Atlas Honda Ltd. Except for a few cosmetic changes, the Pakistani version has remained exactly the same as the original 1980s Japanese CG125 over the past years. Other variants, CG 'Dream' and CG125 'Deluxe' with some extra features, such as a modernized styling, were later added. The later 2019 SE model has a 5 speed transmission instead of the original 4 speed, electric start. It is one of the few motorcycles offered By Honda in Pakistan, others include Honda 70 or Honda CD70, which is based on the original Japanese Honda C70. Latest in two wheeler category includes CB125F, CB150F and CB250F. In the UK, the CG125 was popular with learners due to licensing laws which allow a rider to operate a 125 cc motorbike with L plates by completing a Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) course. In Brazil, due to emission laws from 2009, the engine has been redesigned with an overhead camshaft (bore and stroke also changed from 56.5mm x 49.5mm to 52.4mm x 57.8mm). Due to Euro 3 emission laws the Honda CG125 has been replaced by the fuel injected CBF125 in UK and Europe since 2009. Other manufacturers made overhead valve clones of the CG125 engine with same piston bore and stroke (56.5mm x 49.5mm) which to comply with Euro 3 emission laws and they are widely available (as of 2020). History The CG125 was developed from the CB125 for developing countries' markets. The two models were very similar, with many parts in common. The main difference was in the top ends: the CB had an overhead cam(OHC). One fault with many Honda OHC engines of that era (generally denoted CB), was that they had a tendency to wear the camshaft bearings if oil changes were skipped. The CG engine was developed specifically to address this problem (amongst others) as Honda realised that riders in developing countries performed little or no preventative maintenance. To make the bike more reliable with minimal servicing, the CG125 uses overhead valves(OHV) with pushrods, a washable foam air filter, and fully enclosed chain. The fully enclosed chain was dropped in 2004.Honda Corporate Web Site \\"CG125 1975\\" Changes Over its lifetime, the CG125 has received numerous enhancements and tweaks: * The electrics were upgraded from 6 V to 12 V (1985 in UK). * The point (contact breaker) ignition system was replaced by the capacitor discharge ignition(CDI) system (1989 in Japan) and a little later in other countries. By 1993 Honda was using only CDI ignition systems for all of its motorcycles. * An electric start was added in 2001, originally alongside the original kick start and replacing it completely in 2004 (in the European Market). 2004 saw a number of further changes in the European market: * The front drum brake was replaced by a disc brake. * A new instrument cluster, including a fuel gauge for the first time, replaced the old square unit. * The fuel capacity was increased from to . * The styling was modernised. * The chain casing was dropped in favour of a simpler chain guard. This last change is one of the very few changes that sacrificed functionality (longer chain life) in favour of aesthetics.

It is led by a bishop who serves as pastor of the cathedral, the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Boise. The diocese is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Portland. History =Eighteenth and nineteenth century= The first Catholics to arrive in the territory that would eventually become the Diocese of Boise were French-Canadian fur trappers in the mid-eighteenth century. That remained the sole Catholic contact in the area until 1815, when 19 Iroquois migrated into Idaho from eastern Canada. These Iroquois had the rudiments of Catholic belief, and apparently spoke of the need for \\"black robes\\" to show the way to heaven. Thereafter, for the next twenty-five years, members of the Nez Perce and Flathead tribes made four journeys to St. Louis, Missouri, attempting to recruit a priest for their communities. Their efforts bore fruit when, in 1840, Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, S.J., a Belgian missionary, was appointed to minister to them. The first Mass in Idaho was thus celebrated by Fr. De Smet on 22 July 1840 at Henry's Lake. Fr. De Smet's Jesuit order constructed the first Catholic church in Idaho, built in 1843 along the St. Joe River (near the present-day town of St. Maries) under the leadership of Father Nicholas Point, S.J.. The mission was later moved to banks of the Coeur d'Alene River. The church, named after the Sacred Heart, is most commonly known as the Cataldo Mission. It is the oldest building in Idaho. Until 1862, Catholicism in Idaho remained limited to the tribes of Native Americans in north. However, a gold rush began in 1862 that brought tens of thousands of people to the Boise basin, including a large number of Irish Catholics. President Abraham Lincoln created the Territory of Idaho in 1863, and Pope Pius IX followed up five years later in 1868 by declaring Idaho an apostolic vicariate. At that time, both the territory and the vicariate apostolic included the current state of Idaho and the western portions of Montana and Wyoming. Louis Aloysius Lootens, a native of Belgium a priest of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, was named the first Vicar Apostolic of Idaho, being consecrated as such in the old St. Mary's Cathedral on August 9, 1868 by Archbishop Joseph S. Alemany. At the time, the population of Idaho consisted of approximately 20,000 people, of whom only 1,500 were Catholic. Shortly after his appointment, Bishop Lootens was called to Rome to participate in the First Vatican Council. When he returned to Idaho, he found that the gold rush had ended, leaving only scattered ghost towns in its wake. Lootens submitted his resignation, and moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where he died on January 12, 1898. Eight years after Lootens' resignation, on 7 October 1887, a new vicar apostolic Alphonse Joseph Glorieux was appointed by Pope Leo XIII. Glorieux, a native of Belgium and an alumnus of the American College of the Immaculate Conception there, was consecrated bishop by Cardinal James Gibbons while attending the Third Council of Baltimore on 19 April 1885 in the Cathedral of the Assumption (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). The bishop made Boise his see, and established St. John the Evangelist parish as the cathedral. On the 25 August 1893, Pope Leo XIII established Boise as a diocese and appointed Glorieux as its first bishop. =Twentieth century= The opening of large tracts of land to settlement and the arrival of the railroad greatly increased the population of Idaho. When the diocese was officially established in 1893, there were approximately 7,000 Catholics in the state. It grew dramatically over the following century. One group of significance are the Basque people, who began immigrating to Idaho early in the twentieth century and primarily worked within the sheep industry. (Approximately 15,000 of their descendants remain in the diocese today.) Succeeding Glorieux as bishop in 1918 was Monsignor Daniel Mary Gorman selected by Pope Benedict XV. Gorman was a priest of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, Iowa. He oversaw large growth within the diocese during his nine years as bishop, adding 32 diocesan priests, completing construction on the cathedral, and doubling enrollment in parish schools. The third bishop of Boise was Edward Joseph Kelly, a native of The Dalles, Oregon and priest of the Diocese of Baker City. Kelly was selected by Pope Pius XI. Consecrated as bishop in 1928, Bishop Kelly served for 28 years until his death in 1956; the state's only Catholic high school bears his name (Bishop Kelly High School). On the death of Kelly, Pope Pius XII gave the See of Boise to James J. Byrne, who was transferred to the Archdiocese of Dubuque in 1962. The fifth bishop of Boise, Sylvester W. Treinen, a priest of the Diocese of Bismarck, chosen by Pope John XXIII. Treinen was consecrated on July 25, 1962. He promptly departed for Rome, where he attended three sessions of the Second Vatican Council. As bishop, he is remembered for implementing the decrees of that council. Treinen retired in 1988 and died in 1996, having served the diocese as a bishop (and bishop emeritus) for 34 years. Pope John Paul II had Tod Brown installed as the sixth bishop of Boise on April 3, 1989. He became the Bishop of Orange in 1998. On January 19, 1999, Michael P. Driscoll was appointed bishop by Pope John Paul II. Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, large numbers of migrant workers from Mexico arrived in the diocese. Some settled permanently in the region, while many others remained migratory and would return to Mexico after the harvest. Toward the latter part of the century, the number of immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America increased dramatically, with the vast majority of them settling permanently in the southern part of the diocese. So many immigrants have now made Idaho their home that people of Latin American heritage now constitute well over half of the Catholics within the diocese. The diocese today Approximately 150,000 Catholics live within the Diocese of Boise, making them approximately 11% of the population of the state of Idaho. The diocese is divided up into six regions, called deaneries. In the whole of the diocese, there are 51 parishes, 31 stations, and 25 chapels. There are also five Catholic hospitals‚Äînamely Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, Mercy Medical Center in Nampa, St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in Lewiston, St. Mary Hospital in Cottonwood, and St. Benedict Medical Center in Jerome ‚Äî 13 elementary schools, and one high school--Bishop Kelly in Boise. As of November 2014, the diocese has two vicars general, Very Reverend Dennis Wassmuth (Vicar General for Finance), and Very Reverend Joseph daSilva (Vicar General for the Clergy and Parishes). The chancellor is Mark Raper, who also serves as the Director of the Diocesan Canonical Office. On November 4, 2014, Pope Francis appointed Peter F. Christensen as the eighth bishop of Boise. He was installed on December 17, 2014 at St. John Cathedral in Boise, Idaho. =Sex abuse= In 1985, Diocese priest Mel Baltazar was sentenced to 7 years in prison after being convicted of molesting children as early as 1966.http://www.bishop- accountability.org/news3/1985_01_24_Green_JudgeSays_Carmelo_Baltazar_2.htm The presiding judge also stated that the Catholic Church protected Baltazar while he served in various positions throughout the world as well.

It was built intentionally to accommodate tourism, and prior to building commencing the streets were planned, constructed, and serviced in advance. The town has four main beaches, all of which are natural: Playa de los Charcos, Playa de las Cucharas, Playa del Jablillo and Playa Basti√°n.  History  The company Explosivos R√≠o Tinto, then directed by Mr. Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, later President of the Government, bought a 12 million square meter property, in order to destine it to a high level tourist urbanization, which it baptized as \\"Urbanizaci√≥n Costa de Teguise\\", which was therefore planned from the beginning as a tourist nucleus of the island. Construction began in 1970 with the first five-star hotel on Lanzarote, the Gran Meli√° Salinas, designed by architect Fernando Higueras with the collaboration of local artist C√©sar Manrique. This has been followed by many other 4 and 5 star hotels.  Beaches  Costa Teguise has four main beaches. * Playa de las Cucharas is the biggest and the only one with toasted sand. It is well known for the practice of windsurfing, and each year a freestyle event of the PWA World Tour is held here. * Playa de los Charcos is almost joined to Playa de las Cucharas but this one has white sand. * Playa del Jablillo is the smallest and quietest beach of Costa Teguise. This is due to the breakwaters that, especially during low tide, almost form a natural pool. It is also white sand. * Playa Basti√°n is further south of the town and is a mixture of white sand and small volcanic stones known as pic√≥n on the islands.  Sport  =Golf= Costa Teguise Golf was designed by John Harris and built in the late 1970s. For about 30 years it was the only golf course on Lanzarote until Lanzarote Golf was built in Puerto del Carmen.

USWeb's business model was to acquire small, independent web consulting firms with a franchise model and then merge them and their customer bases into its conglomerate, allowing these smaller franchises to use the USWeb brand for their services in exchange for public stock as payment, with USWeb progressively growing its customer base. Critics, including competitors and analysts, expressed skepticism for this business model, citing doubts that USWeb would find a niche market in an industry that puts a high premium on innovation, and questioning its ability to sustain customer growth for its brand and services with this business model. In 1999, during the merger of USWeb and CKS, one of the founders and CEO of USWeb, Joseph P.

Agriculture Vehari is known to be a city of cotton, among other crops. Vehari has dozens of cotton processing factories and cottonseed oil manufacturing plants; sugarcane farming and processing is also common. Agricultural products include mangoes in the summer and guava and other citrus fruits in the winter. The summer in Vehari is extremely hot; the weather became pleasant during October and February but in recent years it has been reduced to barely three months from December to February. During the summers, temperature hit 45 to 50 degree Celsius on a regular basis. The rainfall is very light throughout the year in Vehari. Recent years have seen Vehari struggle for rainfall even during the usually busy monsoon season. When rainfall is light rainfall the land is generally arid and dusty. History Vehari District was an agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley Civilization. The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Vehari was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Shahi kingdoms. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005, he conquered the Shahis in Kabul and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikhs invaded and occupied Vehari District. During the period of British rule, Vehari district increased in population and importance. Vehari District is the result of construction of the Pakpattan canal from Sulemanki Head Works on the Sutlej and the institution of Nili Bar colony project in 1925, so called because of the hints of blue in the water of the Sutlej. The ancient history of the district is obscure. The populated areas in ancient times was restricted to the banks of the river Sutlej where seasonal inundation permitted some cultivation. The rest of the area was a vast sandy scrap-land at best affording pastures itinerant herdsmen. The riparian tract formed the state of Fatehpur during the time of Akbar the Great. This was ruled by Fateh Khan of Joya family who founded and gave his name to the town of Fatehpur. (Fatehpur is still in existence about 15 kilometres to the south of Mailsi and is the oldest town of Mailsi subdivision. It has some remains of archaeological value.) The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Vehari District. The main castes in Vehari are Jatt, Dhudhi- Rajput, Joyia-Rajput, Sheikh, Bhatti-Rajput, Baloch, Khokhars, Daha, Gujjar, Arian, Sial, Awan, Langrial. In May 2002, Vehari District was the scene of a shootout between members of the Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) and local Shia villagers. LeJ members had come to a local village to stage an attack on a prominent local Shia but were met with local armed resistance. In the ensuing shootout, all four LeJ members were killed, including their leader, Riaz Basra.Police kill Pakistan's most wanted man BBC News, 14 May 2002Howard D.

Transport Tehsil Vehari and villages Vehari railway station Vehari is on the southern alternate route of railway and road between Multan and Lahore, the capital of the province. The northern route is the main route. Both run roughly in a northeasterly direction, almost parallel to each other and only 20 to 30 miles apart at any point. A section of the railway between Multan and Lahore was electrified on the main line between Khanewal and Lahore during the 1960s; however, in subsequent decades and lately with rapid decline and deterioration of the infrastructure of Pakistan Railway (PR), the electrified section lies in ruins and is not likely to be restored in the foreseeable future. With the new motorway between Multan and Lahore which was due to be completed sometimes in the early part of 2014, Vehari is set to benefit from its proximity to its north. Culture The Vehari route goes to Lahore through the religiously renowned city of Pakpattan, where the Sufi saint Fariduddin Ganjshakar is buried. Thousands of pilgrims come annually to Pakpattan for the saint's Urs celebration which include all sorts of festivities. Selections from his work are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh sacred scripture. He was commonly known as \\"Baba Farid\\". Power Radio FM 99 has a station for Vehari.

Directly north of the village proper is North Hillsgrove, a typical early to mid-twentieth century suburban neighborhood. In 1867 industrialist Thomas Jefferson Hill built the Rhode Island Malleable Iron Works at what is today Jefferson Boulevard and Kilvert Street.Warwick's Villages: Glimpses from the Past (Donald A.

Early years Moreda was born in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, one of three children born to Alberto Moreda Cifuentes and Celestina Tuya Lafuente. Her siblings were her sister, Adela Moreda Tuya, and her brother, Alberto Moreda Tuya. Her father was born in Gij√≥n, Asturias, northern Spain, and had come with his brother to Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1921, her mother died and she was raised by her father and sisters. Moreda received her primary and secondary education at the Catholic school \\"Colegio La Milagrosa\\" in Mayag√ºez. At first she thought that she would like to become a nun; however, after participating in a school play, she decided that she would prefer to become an actress. Acting career After she graduated from high school, Moreda auditioned for theatre roles and participated in many local productions. At first she would tell everyone that she was a Gallega (a person from Galicia, located in the north-western corner of Spain) and she was nicknamed \\"La Gallega\\". Besides theatre, she also made many presentations on radio. On March 28, 1954, Moreda participated in the first televised program in Puerto Rico, a comedy titled \\"El Caso de la Mujer Asesinadita\\" (The Case of the Assassinated Woman) alongside Mapy Cort√©s and Fernando Cort√©s which was transmitted by WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. In 1960, she acted in \\"Casos y cosas de casa\\" (Cases and things of the house) with Braulio Castillo and Lillian Hurst. She also acted in the soap opera \\"La Gata\\" (The (female) Cat) and became very attached to the cat on the set. She then adopted many cats and dogs, and she named each one of the animals after a famous person. Among the movies in which Moreda acted are the following: Romance en Puerto Rico (Romance in Puerto Rico) (1962), with Jos√© Miguel Agrelot, Bobby Cap√≥ and Luis Vigoreaux; Jucio contra un Angel (Judgement against an Angel) (1964), alongside Braulio Castillo and Luis Vigoreaux and D√≠os los Cr√≠a (God creates them) (1979) alongside Norma Candal, Gladys Rodr√≠guez, Otilio Warrington, Esther Sandoval and director Jacobo Morales.

The network remained on the air until 10 May 1999. It was part of Grupo Bloch, which published the magazine Manchete by Bloch Editores, its publishing division; the television network was named after the magazine. With sophisticated equipment and seeking an upper class schedule, Manchete was known for its programming based on journalism, covering the world and Brazilian sport, with major sporting events. Telenovelas, series and miniseries from Manchete also made history in the Brazilian television dramaturgy. In addition to their own schedule, Manchete is known as airing Japanese programmes like tokusatsu and anime. In May 1999, the partners Amilcare Dallevo and Marcelo de Carvalho (known as TeleTV Group) bought the licenses of Manchete, moved the headquarters to Barueri, and changed the network's name to RedeTV!.  History  = Early history = The successor network not only to Rede Tupi but to Rede Excelsior, two former Brazilian television networks, it was owned by Adolpho Bloch, the Ukrainian ‚Äì Brazilian founder of the publishing group called \\"Bloch Editores\\", from half of the defunct Rede Tupi (the other half became SBT in 1981). Its slogan in 1983 was the unofficial slogan \\"A Televis√£o do ano 2000\\" (The Television of the year 2000) and the official slogan \\"A TV de 1¬™ Classe\\" (First Class Television). Initially planned to launch between September and November 1982, and then March 1983, Manchete began operations at 7:00 pm on 5 June 1983 with a speech by Bloch, followed by a segment with the network's logo flying over Brazil and then stopping on a building. The network received high ratings in Rio de Janeiro, and as a result, it suddenly moved to second place in viewership in that area. In the beginning, the network broadcast various shows and operas, like TV Record in 60s, bringing the focus for the A and B Classes. In 1984, model and actress Xuxa presented the Clube da Crian√ßa program in 1984, beating sometimes TV Globo's morning show, Bal√£o Magico. This was the year it began a rival coverage of the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, its most successful one. In 1985, with two years of existence, losses of Manchete were evident. The network entered its first financial crisis. Bloch, in 1988, wanted to sell the network and asked for US$350 million. In the 1990s, congressman Paulo Oct√°vio made a proposal to Adolpho Bloch of the proposed purchase of TV Manchete for US$200 million. The Paulo Oct√°vio partner was the businessman Jo√£o Carlos Di Genio, but the sale was not made. Editora Abril also showed interest in the network. Then the IBF company took Manchete, but then had revoked its management justice. Adolpho Bloch took control of the network, with staff salaries six months late. Within four months, Bloch had brought staff pay back up to date. By 1987, for the first time, Rede Manchete and Rede Globo jointly broadcast the Brazilian Carnival to all over the country. The next year, however, the network was in a weak financial situation after just 5 years, but came out stronger. = The Pantanal phenomenon = 1990 saw the launch of the telenovela Pantanal (named after the Pantanal wetlands on which it was set), which would beat the TV Globo telenovela Rainha da Sucata (Queen of the Junk) in popularity and score. The story mixed romance, very beautiful images of the Mato Grosso Pantanal and a bit of the supernatural. The plot centered around a son of a big farmer of Mato Grosso that came to know his father for the first time, and also Juma, a wild lady that lives in a forest cabin and transforms herself in a jaguar when she's angry, with which he falls in love. Afterwards, Manchete continued making telenovelas that well known for their good image and content quality. They were exported to various countries, but never proved as successful as Pantanal or competing telenovelas from the Rede Globo. However, beginning in 1992 and continuing through the end of the decade, the network was forced off the air three times; the first of those shutdowns was due to an invasion of employees at the network's transmission tower in S√£o Paulo. = Closure = After Bloch's death in 1995, his nephew Pedro Jack Kapeller became president of Manchete. Manchete's financial troubles deepened after the 1998 FIFA World Cup, when the network's income fell 40 percent. As a result, the network laid off 540 employees, as well as pay day wages of the remaining employees. In October 1998, the network cut the production of almost all of its programs, including the telenovela '. The network was to be sold to Reborn in Christ Church in January 1999, but in February of the same year, the proposal was withdrawn due to a breach of contractual clauses. On 8 May 1999, Rede Manchete's license was sold to TeleTV Group for US$608 million. Against the slogan used when was launched, Manchete didn't reach the year 2000, ceasing operations on 10 May 1999. The final day of Manchete on the air showed a segment with the network's logo flying over Brazil and then stopping on a building, and afterwards showed the logo with the \\"You In First Place\\" slogan for about a minute before permanently fading to black and showing static. On 14 May, control of the network was passed from Bloch Editores to the TeleTV Group; the concessions of channel 9 in S√£o Paulo and channel 6 in Rio de Janeiro was also acquired. Later that month, RedeTV! began test broadcasts under the name TV!; the network broadcast some programs that were previously aired by Rede Manchete, as well as a modified version of its daily newscast.

It is the oldest continuing music publisher in the United States. It has been owned by Carl Fischer Music since 2004.Carl Fischer to acquire Theodore Presser. History =Theodore Presser= Theodore Presser was born July 3, 1848, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to German emigrant Christian Presser and Caroline Dietz. As a young man he worked in an iron foundry helping to mold cannonballs for the army during the Civil War. This activity proved too strenuous for his young physique, and at 16 he began selling tickets for the Strokosch Opera Company in Pittsburgh. In 1864, he began working as a clerk at C.C. Mellor's music store in Pittsburgh. He eventually achieved the position of sheet music department manager. Presser began his musical studies at 19 by learning to play the piano. At 20, he began studies music at Mt. Union College, where he stayed for a year and then worked as a piano teacher at Ohio Northern University for two years. Further studies were completed at Miami Conservatory of Music, the New England Conservatory, and the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany under Reinecke, Jadassoh, and Zwintscher. His late start in learning to play the piano handicapped his technique. He is credited as the founder of the Department of Music at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he taught 1876‚Äì1878. While there, he founded the Music Teachers National Association. His studies in Germany lasted from 1878 to 1880. He then became director of music at Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia. In October 1883, while working at Hollins, he began publication of The Etude music magazine with only $250 in cash. The immediate success of his new magazine prompted him to seek larger publishing facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1884. Presser died in Philadelphia on October 28, 1925. He married Helen Louise Curran (1890; d. 1905) and Elise Houston (1908; d. 1922). =The Presser Company= Presser's need for music content within The Etude resulted in his establishment as a dealer and publisher. Following the purchase of the John Church Company in 1930, the Theodore Presser Company acquired the Oliver Ditson Company in 1931. Through this acquisition, Presser traces its origins to 1783, when Batelle's Book Store (later the Oliver Ditson Company), began a music publishing business in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1972, the Theodore Presser Company acquired Elkan-Vogel and its locally represented agencies (including Hamelle et cie., Henry Lemoine et cie. and others), making the Theodore Presser Company a major distributor of French music in the United States. On August 31, 2004, Presser closed its retail music stores in both King of Prussia and Center City Philadelphia. The company now focuses primarily on publishing and distribution activities from its headquarters in King of Prussia. In addition to its own catalog, Presser represents the music of more than 70 U.S. and foreign publishers including Universal Edition, Peermusic Classical, √âditions Alphonse Leduc, and B√§renreiter. =Presser Foundation= The publishing company that Presser founded was so successful that in 1906 Presser was able to express his appreciation to those who made this success possible by establishing the Presser Home for Retired Music Teachers located on West Johnson Street in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia. His philanthropic zeal is continued to this day through his foresight in forming the Presser Foundation in 1916, nine years before his death. Each year, the Presser Foundation awards scholarships, grants and funds specifically to further the cause of music and music education in America.

Apponaug consists of what is effectively a large rotary. In the 1960s, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation was in need of a faster way to feed the increasing number of cars through Apponaug that were en route to West Shore Road and other locations. Traffic patterns were rerouted in what was supposed to be a temporary solution, creating a one-way hub in the center of the village. Apponaug is located at the intersection of three of Warwick's primary streets: Post Road (U.S. Route 1), Greenwich Avenue (R.I. Route 5), and Centerville Road (R.I. Route 117). It is considered downtown or central Warwick, as Warwick City Hall is located here, plus police and fire headquarters, the Apponaug branch of the Warwick Public Library, a museum, and the post office.

Adelaide career  Stenglein was originally recruited to the AFL by the Adelaide Crows at pick number 29 in the 1998 draft from the Subiaco Football Club in the WAFL, and debuted in his first season (1999) against the West Coast Eagles in round eight at Subiaco Oval in Perth. After playing four games in his debut season, Stenglein became a regular in the Crows side the next year, playing nearly every game over a four-year period, becoming a highly rated player at the club, and indeed often touted as a potential club captain. After 106 games in six seasons at Adelaide he requested to be transferred back to a club in his home city of Perth, and was eventually traded to the Eagles in the trading period after the end of the 2004 season.  West Coast Eagles career  Stenglein moved to West Coast leaving behind his strong fan base in Adelaide. At West Coast, Stenglein had an immediate impact, providing some hardness to a class midfield brigade, and almost immediately became a fixture in the team. Stenglein was part of the Eagles' 2005 losing Grand Final team in his first season, a season in which he missed only three games. During the turmoil of the West Coast Eagles 2006 pre- season, rumour suggested Stenglein was considered one of the possible choices to replace the disgraced Ben Cousins as club captain, but his lack of time at the club would have counted against him, and it was given to the obvious choice, champion Eagle Chris Judd. During the 2006 season, Stenglein played every match, eventually becoming an AFL Premiership player when selected in the West Coast Eagles Grand Final winning side. After playing 11 games in 2009, the Eagles star announced his retirement on 11 September 2009 at the West Coast club champions awards night despite having a year left on his contract.

This is often served alongside clam chowder. The cakes tend to be eaten dry, dipped in clam chowder, tartar sauce or ketchup. Clam fritters are particularly popular during clamming season when clams are in abundance and it is legal during limited, specified periods for private citizens to dig their own, and therefore must be used up quickly so they do not spoil. Hank Shaw described them as, \\"think clam beignet, or donut hole. Only savory. Crispy, golden brown on the outside, pillowy and light on the inside. Steam rises from the first bite. The slightest aroma of brine surrounds you. Tiny chunks of clam nestle themselves in the folds of the pillow, offering surprising bites of chewy meatiness as you down one of these little glories after another.\\"  Preparation  Each clam cake is a deep fried ball-shaped mixture containing chopped clam (usually quahog) combined with various other ingredients to give it a firm, hushpuppy-like consistency once fried. The batter is made from flour, milk, clam juice, eggs and a leavening agent, typically baking powder. Some recipes may include cornmeal.  History  Local legend holds that clam cakes were first served at Aunt Carrie's, a seafood restaurant in Narragansett, Rhode Island in 1920. According to this legend, Carrie Cooper invented clam cakes by adding fresh clams to her corn fritter recipe, thus inventing clam fritters. Clam cake recipes are actually as old as the 19th Century, and are an old staple of Rhode Island banking crisis cuisine.

It includes two lines running from Vyborg to Lubmin near Greifswald forming original Nord Stream, and two lines under construction running from Ust-Luga to Lubmin termed Nord Stream 2. In Lubmin the lines connect to the OPAL line to Olbernhau on the Czech border and to the NEL line to Rehden near Bremen. Nord Stream is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state company Gazprom, and Nord Stream 2 is owned and will be operated by Nord Stream 2 AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. The first line of Nord Stream (also known as Nord Stream 1 ) was laid by May 2011 and was inaugurated on 8 November 2011. The second line of Nord Stream was laid in 2011‚Äì2012 and was inaugurated on 8 October 2012. At in length, Nord Stream is the longest sub-sea pipeline in the world, surpassing the Langeled pipeline. Laying Nord Stream 2 was carried out in 2018‚Äì2019, and before the imposition of U.S. sanctions which halted the work, it was expected to become operational in mid-2020. Nord Stream has a total annual capacity of of gas, and the addition of Nord Stream 2 is expected to double the capacity to a total of . Nord Stream projects have been opposed by the United States as well as several Central and Eastern European countries because of concerns that it would increase Russia's influence in the region. The U.S. resistance of Nord Stream 2 is also influenced by the country's increased production of natural gas, which gives the U.S. Congress economic incentive to resist the Russian supply of gas to the EU, in favour of U.S. shale gas. The name \\"Nord Stream\\" occasionally refers to a wider pipeline network, including the feeding onshore pipeline in the Russian Federation, and further connections in Western Europe. History Nord Stream opening ceremony on 8 November 2011 with Angela Merkel, Dmitry Medvedev, Mark Rutte and Fran√ßois Fillon. =Nord Stream= The original pipeline project started in 1997 when Gazprom and the Finnish oil company Neste (in 1998 merged with Imatran Voima to form Fortum, which in 2004 separated again into Fortum and Neste) formed the joint company North Transgas Oy for construction and operation of a gas pipeline from Russia to Northern Germany across the Baltic Sea. North Transgas cooperated with the German gas company Ruhrgas (which later became part of E.ON, which was split still later into E.ON and Uniper). A route survey in the Exclusive Economic Zones of Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, and a feasibility study of the pipeline was conducted in 1998. Several routes were considered including routes with onshore segments through Finland and Sweden. On 24 April 2001, Gazprom, Fortum, Ruhrgas and Wintershall adopted a statement regarding a joint feasibility study for construction of the pipeline. On 18 November 2002, the Management Committee of Gazprom approved a schedule of project implementation. In May 2005, Fortum withdrew from the project and sold its stake in North Transgas to Gazprom. As a result, Gazprom became the only shareholder of North Transgas Oy. On 8 September 2005, Gazprom, BASF and E.ON signed a basic agreement on the construction of a North European Gas Pipeline. On 30 November 2005, the North European Gas Pipeline Company (later renamed Nord Stream AG) was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland. On 9 December 2005, Gazprom started construction of the Russian onshore feeding pipeline (Gryazovets‚ÄìVyborg gas pipeline) in the town of Babayevo in Vologda Oblast. The feeding pipeline was completed in 2010. On 4 October 2006, the pipeline and the operating company were officially renamed Nord Stream AG. After establishment of Nord Stream AG, all information related to the pipeline project, including results of the seabed survey of 1998, were transferred from North Transgas to the new company, and on 2 November 2006, North Transgas was officially dissolved. The environmental impact assessment started on 16 November 2006 with notification sent to Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, as parties of origin (the countries whose exclusive economic zones and/or territorial waters the pipeline is planned to pass through), as well as to Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia as affected parties. The final report on transboundary environmental impact assessment was delivered on 9 March 2009. On 19 March 2007, Nord Stream AG hired Italian company Snamprogetti, a subsidiary of Saipem, for detailed design engineering of the pipeline. A letter of intent for construction works was signed with Saipem on 17 September 2007 and the contract was concluded on 24 June 2008. On 25 September 2007, the pipe supply contracts were awarded to the pipe producers EUROPIPE and OMK, and on 18 February 2008, the concrete weight coating and logistics services agreement was awarded to EUPEC PipeCoatings S.A. The supply contracts for the second line were awarded to OMK, Europipe and Sumitomo Heavy Industries on 22 January 2010. On 30 December 2008 Rolls-Royce plc was awarded a contract to supply turbines for the compressor, and on 8 January 2009, Royal Boskalis Westminster and Danish Dredging Contractor Rohde Nielsen A/S. were awarded a joint venture seabed dredging contract. The agreement to take Gasunie to the consortium as the fourth partner, was signed on 6 November 2007. On 10 June 2008, Gasunie was included in the register of shareholders. On 1 March 2010, French energy company GDF Suez signed with Gazprom a memorandum of understanding to acquire 9% stake in the project. The transaction was closed in July 2010. In August 2008, Nord Stream AG hired former Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen as a consultant to help speed up the application process in Finland and to serve as a link between Nord Stream and Finnish authorities. On 21 December 2007, Nord Stream AG submitted application documents to the Swedish government for the pipeline construction in the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone. On 12 February 2008, the Swedish government rejected the consortium's application which it had found incomplete. New application was filed later. On 20 October 2009, Nord Stream received a construction permit to build the pipeline in the Danish waters. On 5 November 2009, the Swedish and Finnish authorities gave a permit to lay the pipeline in their exclusive economic zones. On 22 February 2010, the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland issued the final environmental permit allowing construction of the Finnish section of the pipeline. On 15 January 2010 construction of the Portovaya compressor station in Vyborg near the Gulf of Finland began. The first pipe of the pipeline was laid on 6 April 2010 in the Swedish exclusive economic zone by the Castoro Sei vessel. In addition to Castoro Sei, also Castoro 10 and Solitaire were contracted for pipe-laying works. Construction of the pipeline was officially launched on 9 April 2010 at Portovaya Bay. The laying of the first line was completed on 4 May 2011 (the last pipe put in place), while all underwater works on the first line were completed on 21 June 2011. In August 2011, Nord Stream was connected with the OPAL pipeline. First gas was pumped into the first line on 6 September 2011. The pipeline was officially inaugurated by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on 8 November 2011 at the ceremony held in Lubmin. Construction of the second line was completed in August 2012 and it was inaugurated on 8 October 2012. =Nord Stream 2= In 2011, Nord Stream AG started evaluation of an expansion project consisting of two additional lines (later named Nord Stream 2) to increase the overall annual capacity up to . In August 2012, Nord Stream AG applied to the Finnish and Estonian governments for route studies in their underwater exclusive economic zones for the third and fourth lines. It was considered to route the additional pipelines to the United Kingdom but this plan was abandoned. In January 2015, it was announced that the expansion project was put on hold since the existing lines were running at only half capacity due to EU restrictions on Gazprom. In June 2015, an agreement to build Nord Stream 2 was signed between Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie. As the creation of a joint venture was blocked by Poland, on 24 April 2017, Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Royal Dutch Shell signed a financing agreement with Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom responsible for the development of the Nord Stream 2 project. On 31 January 2018, Germany granted Nord Stream 2 a permit for construction and operation in German waters and landfall areas near Lubmin. In May 2018 construction started at the Greifswald end point. In January 2019, the US ambassador in Germany, Richard Grenell, sent letters to companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2 urging them to stop working on the project and threatening with the possibility of sanctions. In December 2019, the Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Ron Johnson have also urged Allseas owner Edward Heerema to suspend the works on the pipeline, warning him that otherwise the United States would impose sanctions. On 21 December 2019, Allseas announced that the company had suspended its Nord Stream 2 pipelay activities, anticipating enactment of the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 containing sanctions. These sanctions were soon imposed. Nord Stream 2 said it would finish construction \\"as soon as possible\\". In January 2020, Russian president Putin said he expected work on Nord Stream 2 to be completed \\"by the end of this year, or in the first quarter of next year\\". German chancellor Merkel said she \\"does not agree with the US approach\\" of sanctions. In May 2020, the German energy regulator refused an exception from competition rules that require Nord Stream 2 to separate gas ownership from transmission. In August 2020, Poland fined Gazprom 50 million euro due to the latter's lack of cooperation with an investigation by UOKiK, the Polish anti-monopoly watchdog. This comes after the watchdog launched a probe under competition rules against Gazprom and five other companies that are financing the pipeline project, suspecting that they have continued to work on the pipeline without permission from the government of Poland. At that time 160km remained to be constructed, all within Danish waters. Technical features A piece of Nord Stream pipe on public display in Kotka, Finland. =Russian onshore pipeline= Nord Stream is fed by the Gryazovets‚ÄìVyborg gas pipeline. It is a part of the integrated gas transport network of Russia connecting existing grid in Gryazovets with the coastal compressor station at Vyborg. The length of this pipeline is , the diameter of the pipe is , and working pressure is , which is secured by six compressor stations. The Gryazovets-Vyborg pipeline, parallel to the branch of the Northern Lights pipeline, also supplies gas to the Northwestern region of Russia (Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast). The pipeline is operated by Gazprom Transgaz Saint Petersburg. To feed Nord Stream 2, of new pipeline and three compressor stations were built, and five existing compressor stations were expanded. The feeding pipeline starts in Gryazovets and follows the existing route of the Northern Lights pipeline. In Volkhov, the pipeline turns south and continues to the Slavyanskaya compressor station near Ust-Luga. =Baltic Sea offshore pipeline= The semi-submersible pipe-laying vessel Castoro Sei operating for Nord Stream in the Baltic Sea south-east of Gotland, Sweden in late March 2011. Two pipes are welded together on the Castoro Sei pipelaying vessel. The Nord Stream offshore pipeline is operated by Nord Stream AG. It runs from Vyborg compressor station at Portovaya Bay along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to Greifswald in Germany. The length of the subsea pipeline is , of which in Russian inland, in Russian territorial waters, in the Russian economic zone, in the Finnish economic zone, in the Swedish economic zone, in the Danish territorial waters, in the Danish economic zone, in the German economic zone, in German territorial waters and in German inland. The pipeline has two parallel lines, both with capacity of of natural gas per year. Pipes have a diameter of , the wall thickness of and a working pressure of . Nord Stream 2 starts at the Slavyanskaya compressor station near Ust-Luga port, located south-east of the village of Bolshoye Kuzyomkino (Narvusi) in the Kingiseppsky District of the Leningrad Oblast, in the historical Ingria close to the Estonian border. A onshore pipeline runs from the compressor station to the landfall at the Kurgalsky Peninsula on the shore of Narva Bay. Also the landfall point in Kolganpya (Kolkanp√§√§) at the Soikinsky Peninsula was considered as an alternative. Except the Russian section, the route of Nord Stream 2 follows mainly the route of Nord Stream. From the Russian landfall, a section runs through Russian territorial waters to the Finnish exclusive economic zone. The Finnish section is and the following section in the Swedish exclusive economic zone is long. The Danish sections runs on the Danish continental shelf southeast of Bornholm. The German part of the pipeline consists of of offshore pipeline and onshore pipeline connecting the landfall with the Nord Stream 2 receiving terminal. Nord Stream 2 has two parallel lines, both with capacity of of natural gas per year. =Middle and Western European pipelines= Nord Stream is connected to two transmission pipelines in Germany. The southern pipeline (OPAL pipeline) runs from Greifswald to Olbernhau near German-Czech border. It connects Nord Stream with JAGAL (connected to the Yamal-Europe pipeline), and STEGAL (connected to the Russian gas transport route via Czech and Slovak republics) transmission pipelines. The Gazelle pipeline, put into operation in January 2013,Czech Nord Stream natural gas link Gazela flowing at full capacity, ICIS 24 Apr 2013 retrieved 28 April 2013 links the OPAL pipeline with South-German gas network. The western pipeline (NEL pipeline) runs from Greifswald to Achim, where it is connected with the Rehden-Hamburg gas pipeline. Together with the MIDAL pipeline it creates the Greifswald‚ÄìBunde connection. Further gas delivery to the United Kingdom is made through the connection between Bunde and Den Helder, and from there through the offshore interconnector Balgzand‚ÄìBacton (BBL Pipeline). Gazprom has also bought an abandoned mine (Hinrichshagen Structure) in Waren, which it plans to convert into the largest underground gas storage in Europe with capacity of . Nord Stream 2 would be connected to the NEL pipeline and European Gas Pipeline Link (EUGAL). Supply sources natural gas proven reserves (2014), based on data from The World Factbook. Russia has the world's largest reserves. The main source of natural gas for the Nord Stream pipeline is Yuzhno-Russkoye field, which is located in the Krasnoselkupsky District, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Tyumen Oblast. Nord Stream is also fed from fields in Yamal Peninsula, Ob-Taz bay. Gazprom has also indicated that the majority of gas produced at the Shtokman field would be sold to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline. For this purpose, the pipeline from the Shtokman field via Kola peninsula to Volkhov or Vyborg in the Leningrad Oblast has to be built. Costs and financing According to Gazprom, the costs of the onshore pipelines in Russia and Germany were around ‚Ç¨6 billion. The offshore section of the project cost ‚Ç¨8.8 billion. 30% of the financing was raised through equity provided by shareholders in proportion to their stakes in the project, while 70% came from external financing by banks. There were two tranches. The first tranche for a ‚Ç¨3.9 billion includes a 3.1 billion, 16-year facility covered by export credit agencies and an ‚Ç¨800 million, 10-year uncovered commercial loan to be serviced by earnings from the transportation contracts. A ‚Ç¨1.6 billion is covered by French credit insures company Euler Hermes, a ‚Ç¨1 billion by the German United Loan Guarantee Programme UFK, and a ‚Ç¨500 million Italian Export Credit Agency SACE SpA. Loans to be provided by 26 commercial banks. Cr√©dit Agricole is documentation bank and bank facility agent. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale is intercreditor agent, Sace facility agent, security trustee and model bank. Commerzbank is Hermes facility agent, UniCredit is UFK facility agent, Deutsche Bank is account bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation is technical and environmental bank. The financial advisers were Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, Royal Bank of Scotland (ABN Amro), Dresdner Kleinwort (Commerzbank), and Unicredit. The legal adviser to Nord Stream was White & Case and legal adviser for the lenders was Clifford Chance. For Nord Stream 2, the loan from Uniper, Wintershall Dea, OMV, Engie, and Royal Dutch Shell covers 50% of the project costs of ‚Ç¨9.5 billion. The rest is being financed by Gazprom. Contractors The environmental impact assessment was carried out by Ramb√∏ll and Environmental Resource Management. The route and seabed surveys were conducted by Marin M√§tteknik, IfA√ñ, PeterGaz and DOF Subsea. Work preliminary front-end engineering was done by Intec Engineering. The design engineering of the subsea pipeline was done by Snamprogetti (now part of Saipem) and the pipeline was constructed by Saipem. Saipem gave sub-contract to Allseas for laying more than 1/4 of both the pipelines. The seabed was prepared for the laying of the pipeline by a joint venture of Royal Boskalis Westminster and Tideway. The pipes were provided by EUROPIPE, OMK, and Sumitomo. Concrete weight coating and logistics services were provided by EUPEC PipeCoatings S.A. For the concrete weight coating new coating plants were constructed in Mukran (Germany) and Kotka (Finland). Rolls-Royce plc supplied eight aeroderivative gas turbines driving centrifugal compressors for front-end gas boosting at the Vyborg (Portovaya) gas compressor station. Dresser-Rand Group supplied DATUM compressors and Siirtec Nigi SPA provided a gas treatment unit for the Portovaya station. For the construction period, Nord Stream AG created a logistic center in Gotland. Other interim stock yards are located in Mukran, in Kotka, in Hanko (Finland) and in Karlskrona (Sweden). Nord Stream 2 was laid by Allseas using pipe-laying vessels Pioneering Spirit and Solitaire, except the part of German offshore section which was laid by Saipem's pipe- laying vessel C10. Pipes were manufactured by EUROPIPE, OMK and the Chelyabinsk Pipe-Rolling Plant (Chelpipe), and were coated by Wasco Coatings Europe. Blue Water Shipping handled the transportation and storage of pipeline segments in Germany, Finland and Sweden for Wasco. A joint venture of Boskalis and Van Oord did rock placement at the preparatory stage of construction. Kvaerner did the civil and mechanical engineering of the onshore facilities in Russia. Project companies Nord Stream head-office building in Zug. Nord Stream is operated by the special-purpose company Nord Stream AG, incorporated in Zug, Switzerland on 30 November 2005. Shareholders of the company are the Russian gas company Gazprom (51% of shares), German companies Wintershall Dea and PEG Infrastruktur AG (E.ON) (both 15.5%), the Dutch gas company Gasunie (9%), and the French gas company Engie (9%). The Managing Director is Matthias Warnig and the chairman of the shareholders' committee is German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. Nord Stream 2 is developed and will be operated by Nord Stream 2 AG, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. It is registered at the same place and has the same management as Nord Stream AG. Transportation contracts On 13 October 2005 Gazprom signed a contract with German gas company Wingas, a joint venture of Gazprom and Wintershall (subsidiary of BASF), to supply of natural gas per year for 25 years. On 16 June 2006 Gazprom and Danish √òrsted A/S (then named DONG Energy) signed a 20-year contract for delivery of Russian gas per year to Denmark, while √òrsted will supply natural gas per year to the Gazprom's subsidiary, Gazprom Marketing and Trading, in the United Kingdom. 1 October 2009 the companies signed a contract to double the delivery to Denmark. On 29 August 2006 Gazprom and E.ON Ruhrgas signed an agreement to extend current contracts on natural gas supplies and have signed a contract for an additional per year through the Nord Stream pipeline. On 19 December 2006, Gazprom and Gaz de France (now GDF Suez) agreed to an additional gas supply through the Nord Stream. Controversies of Nord Stream The pipeline projects were criticized by some countries and environmental organizations (such as the World Wide Fund for Nature). =Political aspects= Major existing and planned natural gas pipelines supplying Russian gas to Europe. Germany imports 50% to 75% of its natural gas from Russia. Opponents have seen the pipeline as a move by Russia to bypass traditional transit countries (currently Ukraine, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Belarus and Poland). Some transit countries are concerned that a long-term plan of the Kremlin is to attempt to exert political influence on them by threatening their gas supply without affecting supplies to Western Europe. The fears are strengthened by the fact that Russia has refused to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty. Critics of Nord Stream say that Europe could become dangerously dependent on Russian natural gas, particularly since Russia could face problems meeting a surge in domestic as well as foreign demand. Following several Russia‚ÄìUkraine gas disputes over gas prices, as well as foreign policy towards Eastern Europe, it has been noted that the gas supplies by Russia can be used as a political tool. A Swedish Defence Research Agency study, finished in March 2007, counted over 55 incidents since 1991, most with \\"both political and economic underpinnings\\". In April 2006 Rados≈Çaw Sikorski, then Poland's defence minister, compared the project to the infamous 1939 Nazi-Soviet Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. In his book The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West, published 2008, Edward Lucas stated that \\"though Nord Stream's backers insist that the project is business pure and simple, this would be easier to believe if it were more transparent.\\" In the report published by the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in 2008, Norwegian researcher Bendik Solum Whist noted that Nord Stream AG was incorporated in Switzerland, \\"whose strict banking secrecy laws makes the project less transparent than it would have been if based within the EU\\". Secondly, the Russian energy sector \\"in general lacks transparency\\" and Gazprom \\"is no exception\\". The Russian response has been that the pipeline increases Europe's energy security, and that the criticism is caused by bitterness about the loss of significant transit revenues, as well as the loss of political influence that stems from the transit countries' ability to hold Russian gas supplies to Western Europe hostage to their local political agendas. It would reduce Russia's dependence on the transit countries as for the first time it would link Russia directly to Western Europe. According to Gazprom, the direct connection to Germany would decrease risks in the gas transit zones, including the political risk of cutting off Russian gas exports to Western Europe. An anti-trust investigation against Gazprom started in 2011 revealed a number of \\"abusive practices\\" the company applied against various recipients in the EU and Nord Stream 2 was criticized from this angle as strengthening Gazprom's position in the EU even more. European Commission officials expressed the view that \\"Nord Stream 2 does not enhance [EU] energy security\\". =Security and military aspects= Swedish military experts and several politicians, including former Minister for Defence Mikael Odenberg, have stated that the pipeline can cause a security policy problem for Sweden. According to Odenberg, the pipeline motivates Russian navy presence in Swedish economic zone and the Russians can use this for military intelligence should they want to. Finnish military scholar Alpo Juntunen has said that even though the political discussion over Nord Stream in Finland concentrates on the various ecological aspects, there are clearly military implications to the pipeline that are not discussed openly in Finland. More political concerns were raised when Vladimir Putin stated that the ecological safety of the pipeline project will be ensured by using the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Navy. German weekly Stern has reported that the fibre optic cable and repeater stations along the pipeline could theoretically also be used for espionage. Nord Stream AG asserted that a fibre-optic control cable was neither necessary nor technically planned. The Economist warned Europe is to become more dependent on Russia while its own reserves decline. Deputy Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of Gazprom Alexander Medvedev has dismissed these concerns, stating that \\"some objections are put forward that are laughable‚Äîpolitical, military or linked to spying. That is really surprising because in the modern world ... it is laughable to say a gas pipeline is a weapon in a spy war.\\" German Bundeswehr asked Nord Stream to change the planned route because the pipeline is laid close to a sea testing ground near R√ºgen, which is actively used for naval exercises. =Economic aspects= Russian and German officials have claimed that the pipeline leads to economic savings due to the elimination of transit fees (as transit countries would be bypassed), and a higher operating pressure of the offshore pipeline which leads to lower operating costs (by eliminating the necessity for expensive midway compressor stations). According to Ukrtransgaz, the Ukrainian gas transportation system operator, Ukraine alone will lose natural gas transit revenues up to $720 million per year. In the same time, according to Naftogaz of Ukraine board chairman Ukraine will lose $3 billion, which it annually receives from the transit of natural gas to the EU countries if the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is built. Gazprom has stated that it will divert of natural gas transported through Ukraine to Nord Stream. Opponents say that the maintenance costs of a submarine pipeline are higher than for an overland route. In 1998, former Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev claimed that the project was economically unfeasible. As the Nord Stream pipeline crosses the waterway to Polish ports in Szczecin and ≈öwinouj≈õcie, there were concerns that it will reduce the depth of the waterway leading to the ports. However, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk as well as several experts have confirmed that the Nord Stream pipeline does not block the development plans of ≈öwinouj≈õcie and Szczecin ports. =Environmental aspects= The greatest environmental impact in connection with the pipeline results from the consumption of the transported gas, if it allows more imports to the EU. That would be in conflict with decarbonization efforts for climate protection. At a nominal capacity of , each pipe pair can cause carbon emissions of 110 million tonnes each annually.Conversion with 10.1 kWh/m3 and 0.056 t /GJ Methane losses during extraction and transport need to be added. For the Portowaja compressor station at the Russian beginning of North Stream 1 with a rating of 366 megawatts, emissions of around 1.5 million tons p.a. are estimated, http://www.gazprom.de/projects/nord-stream/ Retrieved on September 7, 2020, with 40% efficiency of the gas turbines not including compressor stations for the gas pipelines within Russia. Since the pressure loss is the square of the flow velocity, dividing an unchanged gas transport volume between two Nord Stream systems could save around 3/4 of the pumping effort and presumably more than one million tons of emissions could be avoided annually. Using the Umweltbundesamt's discounted damage costs of 180 euros / tonne, this would, after a rough estimate, enable the third tube to be amortized within around 20 years from a global point of view. Possibly also the fourth tube could be amortized in the hypothetical case of an overall optimization of gas flow over various pipelines between Russia and the EU. The production of over 2 million tons of steel for the Nord Stream 2 tubes resulted in more than 3 million tons of emissions; not including the concrete coating and the associated pipeline sections onshore. Before construction there were concerns that during construction the sea bed would be disturbed, dislodging World War II-era naval mines and toxic materials including mines, chemical waste, chemical munitions and other items dumped in the Baltic Sea in the past decades, and thereby toxic substances could surface from the seabed, damaging the Baltic's particularly sensitive ecosystem. Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren demanded that the environmental analysis should include alternative ways of taking the pipeline across the Baltic, as the pipeline is projected to be passing through areas considered environmentally problematic and risky. Sweden's three opposition parties called for an examination of the possibility of rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Finnish environmental groups campaigned to consider the more southern route, claiming that the sea bed is flatter and so construction would be more straightforward, and therefore potentially less disruptive to waste, including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, littered on the sea bed. Latvian president Valdis Zatlers said that Nord Stream was environmentally hazardous as, unlike the North Sea, there is no such water circulation in the Baltic Sea. Ene Ergma, Speaker of the Riigikogu (Parliament of Estonia), warned that the pipeline work rips a canal in the seabed which will demand leveling the sand that lies along the way, atomizing volcanic formations and disposing of fill along the bottom of the sea, altering sea currents. The impact on bird and marine life in the Baltic Sea is also a concern, as the Baltic sea is recognized by the International Maritime Organization as a particularly sensitive sea area. The World Wide Fund for Nature requested that countries party to the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) safeguard the Baltic marine habitats, which could be altered by the implementation of the Nord Stream project. Its Finnish branch said it might file a court case against Nord Stream AG if the company did not properly assess a potential alternative route on the southern side of Hogland. According to Nord Stream AG, this was not a suitable route for the pipeline because of the planned conservation area near Hogland, subsea cables, and a main shipping route. Russian environmental organizations warned that the ecosystem in the Eastern part of the Gulf of Finland is the most vulnerable part of the Baltic Sea and assumed damage to the island territory of the planned Ingermanland nature preserve as a result of laying the pipeline. Swedish environmental groups are concerned that the pipeline is planned to pass too closely to the border of the marine reserve near Gotland. Greenpeace is also concerned that the pipeline would pass through several sites designated marine conservation areas. In April 2007, the Young Conservative League (YCL) of Lithuania started an online petition entitled \\"Protect the Baltic Sea While It‚Äôs Still Not Too Late!\\", translated into all state languages of the countries of the Baltic region. On 29 January 2008 the Petitions Committee of the European Parliament organized a public hearing on the petition introduced by the leader of YCL ‚Äì Radvile Morkunaite. On 8 July 2008, the European Parliament endorsed, by 542 votes to 60, a non- binding report calling on the European Commission to evaluate the additional impact on the Baltic Sea caused by the Nord Stream project. The Riigikogu made a declaration on 27 October 2009, expressing \\"concern over the possible environmental impacts of the gas line\\" and emphasizing that international conventions have deemed \\"the Baltic Sea in an especially vulnerable environmental status\\".Riigikogu avaldus. L√§√§nemerre kavandatava gaasijuhtmega seotud keskkonnariskidest Declaration of the Riigikogu. On environmental hazards connected with the gas line planned into the Baltic Sea. In Estonian. The Riigikogu 27 October 2009 Russian officials described these concerns as far-fetched and politically motivated by opponents of the project. They argued that during the construction the seabed will be cleaned, rather than endangered. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that Russia fully respects the desire to provide for the 100% environmental sustainability of the project and that Russia is fully supportive of such an approach, and that all environmental concerns would be addressed in the process of environmental impact assessment. Concerns were raised, since originally Nord Stream AG planned on rinsing out the pipeline with 2.3 billion liters of a solution containing glutaraldehyde, which would be pumped afterward into the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream AG responded that glutaraldehyde would not be used, and even if the chemical were used, the effects would be brief and localized due to the speed with which the chemical breaks down once it comes in contact with water. One of the problems raised was that the Baltic Sea and particularly Gulf of Finland was heavily mined during World War I and II, with many mines still in the sea. According to Marin M√§tteknik around 85,000 mines were laid during the First and Second World Wars, of which only half have been recovered. A lot of munitions have also been dumped in this sea. Critics of the pipeline voiced fears that the pipeline would disturb ammunition dumps. In November 2008 it was reported that the pipeline will run through old sea mine defense lines and that the Gulf of Finland is considered one of the most heavily mined sea areas in the world. Sunken mines, which have been found on the pipeline route, lay primarily in international waters at a depth of more than . Nord Stream AG detonated the mines underwater. =Ethical issues= The former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr√∂der, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, were strong advocates of the pipeline project during the negotiation phase. International media alluded to a past relationship between the Managing Director of Nord Stream AG, Matthias Warnig, himself a former East German secret police officer, and Vladimir Putin when he was a KGB agent in East Germany. These allegations were denied by Matthias Warnig, who said that he had met Vladimir Putin for the first time in his life in 1991, when Putin was the head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office. The agreement to build the pipeline was signed ten days before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, a few weeks before Schr√∂der had stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover ‚Ç¨1 billion of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee expired at the end of 2006 without ever having been needed. Soon after leaving the post of Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr√∂der agreed to head the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG. This has been widely described by German and international media as a conflict of interest, the implication being that the pipeline project may have been pushed through for personal gain rather than for improving gas supplies to Germany. Information about the German government's guarantee was requested by the European Commission. No formal charges have been filed against any party despite years of exhaustive investigations. In February 2009, the Swedish prosecutor's office started an investigation based on suspicions of bribery and corruption after a college on the island of Gotland received a donation from Nord Stream. The 5 million Swedish kronor (US$574,000) donation was directed to a professor at Gotland University College who had previously warned that the Nord Stream pipeline would come too close to a sensitive bird zone. The consortium has hired several former high-ranking officials, such as Ulrica Schenstr√∂m, former undersecretary at the Swedish Prime Minister's office, and Dan Svanell, former press secretary for several politicians in the Swedish Social Democratic Party. In addition, the former Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, had worked for Nord Stream as an adviser since 2008. =Land-based alternatives= On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a statement on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, Kaliningrad and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, would be easier to flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results. There were also calls from Sweden to consider rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Poland had proposed the construction of a second line of the Yamal‚ÄìEurope pipeline, as well as the Amber pipeline through the Baltic states and Poland as land-based alternatives to the offshore pipeline. The Amber project foresees laying a natural gas pipeline across the Tver, Novgorod and Pskov oblasts in Russia and then through Latvia and Lithuania to Poland, where it would be re-connected to the Yamal‚ÄìEurope pipeline. Latvia has proposed using its underground gas storage facilities if the onshore route were to be used. Proponents have claimed that the Amber pipeline would cost half as much as an underwater pipeline, would be shorter, and would have less environmental impact. Critics of this proposal say that in this case it would be more expensive for the suppliers over the long-term perspective, because the main aim of the project is to reduce transit costs. Nord Stream AG has responded that the Baltic Sea would be the only route for the pipeline and it will not consider an overland alternative. =World War II graves= A former member of the European Parliament from Estonia, Andres Tarand has raised the issue that the Nord Stream pipeline could disturb World War II graves dating from naval battles in 1941. A Nord Stream spokesman has stated that only one sunken ship is in the vicinity of the planned pipeline and added that it would not be disturbed. However, on 16 July 2008 it was announced that one of DOF Subsea's seismic vessels had discovered during a survey for the planned Nord Stream pipeline, in Finland's exclusive economic zone in the Gulf of Finland, the wreck of a submarine with Soviet markings, believed to have sunk during World War II. In addition to the wreck of the Soviet submarine, there are sunken ships on the route of Nord Stream in the Bay of Greifswald and in the Gulf of Finland. The ship in the Bay of Greifswald is one of 20 sunk in 1715 by the Swedish navy to create a physical barrier across the shallow entrance to the Bay of Greifswald coastal lagoon. Russian archaeologists claimed that the ship in the Gulf of Finland \\"was probably built in 1710 and sank during a raid aimed at conquering Finland\\" in 1713 during the reign of Peter the Great. Controversies of Nord Stream 2 =Political aspects= In January 2018, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. and Poland oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. They see it as undermining Europe's overall energy security and stability. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline was also opposed by former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, U.S. President Donald Trump, the European Council President Donald Tusk and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The president of the European Council Donald Tusk has said that Nord Stream 2 is not in the EU's interests. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n have questioned the different treatment of Nord Stream 2 and South Stream projects. Some claim that the project violates the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies. A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, was sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the Nord Stream 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the energy transmission assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure must be secured for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU also criticized the project in July 2016. Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targeting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, Russia, 18 May 2018 In June 2017, Germany and Austria criticized the United States Senate over new sanctions against Russia that target the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany,\\"Germany threatens retaliation if U.S. sanctions harm its firms\\". Reuters. June 16, 2017.\\"The U.S. Sanctions Russia, Europe Says 'Ouch!'\\". Bloomberg.

U.S. News. June 15, 2017. They also said: \\"To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the U.S. market if they participate in natural gas projects such as Nord Stream 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations.\\"\\"Germany and Austria warn US over expanded Russia sanctions\\". Politico. June 15, 2017. =EU regulations= According to the amended EU gas directive, the EU extends its gas market rules to external pipelines entering to the EU internal gas market. It applies to all pipelines which were completed after 23 May 2019 when amended directive entered into force. Nord Stream 2 AG has started the legal proceeding in the Court of Justice of the European Union to annul the amended directive and has started the arbitration against the EU under the Energy Charter Treaty. Although Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and has terminated its provisional application, both‚Äîthe EU and Switzerland, a domicile of Nord Stream 2 AG‚Äîare contracting parties of it. =Legal aspects= Some argue that the Nord Stream project violates the provisions of the European Union's Third Energy Package law and international law's rules concerning the law of war. Additional legal concerns relate to international trade law and to the law of the sea in connection with Nord Stream 2's route through the Danish territorial waters around Bornholm. Most commentators appear to agree, however, that the controversies surrounding the Nord Stream project are mostly political and not legal in nature. Businesses involved in Nord Stream 2 have been sanctioned by the United States, which has been seeking to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) to EU states, with the passing of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 on December 20, 2019. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called the sanctions \\"a severe intervention in German and European internal affairs\\", while the EU spokesman criticized \\"the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business.\\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that \\"European energy policy is decided in Europe, not in the United States\\". Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also criticized sanctions, saying that U.S. Congress \\"is literally overwhelmed with the desire to do everything to destroy\\" the Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations. The German Eastern Business Association (OAOEV) said in a statement: \\"America wants to sell its liquefied gas in Europe, for which Germany is building terminals. Should we arrive at the conclusion that US sanctions are intended to push competitors out of the European market, our enthusiasm for bilateral projects with the US will significantly cool.\\" See also * A gas pipeline from Northern Russia through Belarus and Poland to Germany   References External links * Nord Stream official website * Sweden and the NEGP: A Pilot Study of the North European Gas Pipeline and Sweden's Dependence on Russian Energy, Base data report by Robert L.

They may supply food in the form of fruit, nuts, or leaves that can be used as a vegetable; while at the same time supplying firewood, add nitrogen to the soil, or supply some other combination of multiple outputs. \\"Multipurpose tree\\" is a term common to agroforestry, particularly when speaking of tropical agroforestry where the tree owner is a subsistence farmer. While all trees can be said to serve several purposes, such as providing habitat, shade, or soil improvement; multipurpose trees have a greater impact on a farmer‚Äôs well being because they fulfill more than one basic human need. In most cases multipurpose trees have a primary role; such as being part of a living fence, or a windbreak, or used in an ally cropping system. In addition to this they will have one or more secondary roles, most often supplying a family with food or firewood, or both. When a multipurpose tree is planted, a number of needs and functions can be fulfilled at once. They may be used as a windbreak, while also supplying a staple food for the owner. They may be used as fencepost in a living fence, while also being the main source of firewood for the owner. They may be intercropped into existing fields, to supply nitrogen to the soil, and at the same time serve as a source of both food and firewood. Common multipurpose trees of the tropics include: * Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) ‚Äì the most common tree used for living fences in Central America, firewood, fodder, fixing nitrogen into the soil. * Moringa (Moringa oleifera) ‚Äì edible leaves, pods and beans, commonly used for animal forage and shade (it does not fix nitrogen as is commonly believed) * Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) ‚Äì used for food, purified water (juice from inside the coconut), roof thatching, firewood, shade. * Neem (Azadirachta indica) ‚Äì limited use as insect repellent, antibiotic, adding nitrogen to the soil, windbreaks, biomass production for use as mulch, firewood. Ideally most trees found on tropical farms should be multipurpose, and provide more to the farmer than simply shade and firewood. In most cases they should be nitrogen fixing legumes, or trees that greatly increase the farmer's food security.

Early life and education  Trotti was born in Atlanta, US. He became the first graduate of the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia, when he received a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism (ABJ) in 1921. While at UGA, he was the editor of the independent student newspaper The Red and Black.  Professional career  In the silent film era, he was a reporter for the daily Atlanta Georgian, where he interviewed many show business people, such as Viola Dana. Later, Trotti became an executive at Fox Film Corporation in 1933 and after its 1935 merger with Twentieth Century Pictures to become 20th Century Fox, he remained with the company until his death. He wrote about fifty films for the studio, producing many of them. He only wrote one screenplay for another studio, You Can't Buy Everything (1934) for MGM. He won an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay in 1944 for Wilson and was nominated for Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) and There's No Business Like Show Business (1952). He received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement, the lifetime achievement award of the WGA, in 1983. Personal life Trotti was in ill heath towards the end of his life and had taken six months leave from Fox when he died of a heart attack at hospital near his summer home in St Malo in Oceanside, California. He was survived by a widow, a son and a daughter. His eldest son had died in a car crash in 1950. Henry Koster later wrote that he thought Trotti died of \\"a broken heart\\" because of his son's death. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

It became a station on the T≈çhoku Main Line of Japanese Government Railways (JGR), the pre-war predecessor to the Japanese National Railways (JNR), when the Nippon Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1906. On 4 September 1922 it became a joint station, when the Towada Railway (present-day Towada Kank≈ç Electric Railway, also known as T≈çtetsu) connected Furumaki with Towadashi Station. The T≈çtetsu Furumaki Station was relocated 120 meters away on 1 October 1926 and a new station building was completed on 1 January 1959. The T≈çtetsu station was renamed Misawa Station on 1 March 1961 and the JNR station followed on 20 March of the same year. With the privatization of the JNR on 1 April 1987, the JNR Misawa Station came under the operational control of East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight).

The town is located to the north-east of Bangalore. Devanahalli is the site of Kempegowda International Airport. A multibillion-dollar Devanahalli Business Park with two IT Parks are coming up on nearly adjoining the airport. An Aerospace Park, Science Park and a Financial City are also coming up. A new satellite ring road will connect the city with Doddaballapur. Devanahalli is situated near the upcoming , BIAL IT Investment Region, to be the largest IT region in India. Total infrastructure development in the area is estimated to be well over over the next two years. With significant commercial and residential development in the area, real estate is in high demand in the region. Devanahalli was the birthplace of Tipu Sultan, popularly known as the \\"Tiger of Mysore\\". History Devanahalli was part of Gangawadi and later came under the rule of Rashatrakutas, Nolambas, Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara rulers. The Devanahalli Fort The recent history of Devanahalli dates back to the 15th century, when a family of refugees fleeing from Conjeevaram (modern day Kanchi), camped near the foot of Ramaswami betta, east of Nandi Hills. Their leader Rana Baire Gowda was apparently directed in a dream to set up a settlement in this region. He and his Morasu Wokkalu family settled in a small village, Ahuti, which was later known as Avati. His son Malla Baire Gowda founded Devanahalli, Chikka-ballapura and Dodda-ballapura. Kempegowda, the founder of Bangalore city is also from Morasu Wokkalu family.[5] During the time of Vijayanagra rule, Malla Baire constructed the initial mud fort in 1501 AD with the consent of Devaraya at Devanadoddi, the previous name of Devanahalli. In 1747 AD, the fort passed into the hands of the Wodeyars of Mysore under the command of Nanja Raja. It was conquered many times from the Marathas and later came under the control of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Tipu also renamed it as Yousafabad (the abode of Yousuf, the finest man) which never got popular. The fort finally fell into the British, under Lord Cornwallis in 1791, during the Mysore War. Demographics India census, Devanahalli had a population of 23,190. Males constituted 52% of the population and females 48%. Devanahalli had an average literacy rate of 66%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy was 73% and female literacy was 58%. In Devanahalli, 12% of the population was under 6 years of age. Tourism Devanahalli is just an hour's drive from Bangalore. There has been a growth of tourist traffic recently due to the impetus provided by the Bangalore International Airport.

As the name indicates, it is famous for the sweeping views over the western parts of the Auckland Region. The road passes through the village of Waiatarua, but most of it is through native bush (forest), in Centennial Memorial Park or the neighbouring water catchment area. It connects with West Coast Road, Shaw Road, Konini Road and Piha Road to the surf beaches at Karekare and Piha. It is paralleled by the disused Exhibition Drive, now used by mountain bikers. The Arataki Visitor Centre provides displays of the local flora, fauna and geology and well-maintained walking tracks. Along the parts of the road that pass through private land are a native-plant seller, several potters and a disused winery. Large parts of the WaitƒÅkere Ranges are now closed to the public for hiking and walking to help stop the spread of the incurable Kauri dieback disease.  History  Scenic Drive was built during the 1930s depression as a Schedule 5 project to provide work for the unemployed. It was intended to be a tourist route and assist with maintenance of the dams in the water catchment area. Subsequent urban sprawl has meant those small parts of the route not protected as reserve or for water catchment have prestige housing at the southern end, and life style blocks at the north. During construction of the south-east portion of the Scenic Drive in the early 1930s, several quarries were opened up to supply coarse fill material. Two of these quarries were in Shaw Road and Carter Road, on either side of a narrow ridge that runs north from the Scenic Drive. During blasting operations, fossils were discovered in the Shaw Road quarry.

The bill was backed by Democratic Rep. John Conyers. Its goal is \\"[t]o require certain analog conversion devices to preserve digital content security measures\\", i.e. plugging the analog hole. The bill effectively proposes mandating of the VEIL Rights Assertion Mark technology into new video-handling consumer devices. The bill was referred to subcommittee in 2006 and no further action seems to have been taken since then. Advocates MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman applauded the bill, saying it was a \\"very important piece of legislation that will promote more consumer choice as it protects copyright owners in the digital age.\\" Critics Public Knowledge President Gigi Sohn testified before the House Judiciary Committee (United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. Oversight Hearing on \\"Content Protection in the Digital Age: The Broadcast Flag, High-Definition Radio, and the Analog Hole\\") on November 3. She stated: \\"The broad, sweeping draft legislation to close the analog hole suffers from the same problem; it puts the government in the role of making industrial policy, and will severely limit consumers‚Äô ability to make lawful uses of copyrighted content. Like the broadcast flag, the legislation mandates a one-size-fits-all technology that has not been the subject of public or even inter-industry scrutiny. The prohibitions in the legislation would require redesign of a whole range of currently legal consumer devices, including DVD recorders, personal video recorders and camcorders with video inputs. Importantly, the existence of the analog hole has been touted as a \\"safety valve\\" for making fair use of digital media products where circumventing the technological locks has been rendered illegal by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Should Congress close that hole without amending the DMCA to protect fair use, consumers' rights to access digital copyrighted works will be eroded even further. There are better alternatives for protecting digital content than the heavy-handed technology mandates proposed here today. Those alternatives are a multi-pronged approach of consumer education, enforcement of copyright laws and use of technological tools developed in the marketplace, not mandated by government. The recent Grokster decision and the passage of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, which you spearheaded, Mr. Chairman, are just two of several new tools that the content industry has at its disposal to protect its content.\\" =Secrecy= Ed Felten, a respected Computer Scientist, has criticized the law for its secrecy. He calls it a \\"secret law ‚Äî a requirement that all devices that accept analog video inputs must implement a secret technical specification for something called a VEIL detector.

Life Conrad was the son of Burgrave Frederick I (originally Count Frederick III of Zollern), the first Nuremberg Burgrave of the Hohenzollern, and Sophie of Raabs. As a count of Zollern he is enumerated as Conrad I. After the death of his father around 1204 the rank of burgrave passed first to Conrad's younger brother, Frederick II. However, in 1218 (or possibly 1214) the house's possessions were divided again and Conrad then received the possessions in Franconia with the title of burgrave. In this period he strengthened his power and supported the House of Hohenstaufen in the fight between Guelphs and Ghibellines for the royal crown. Emperor Frederick II wished to develop Nuremberg to a dependable base, and therefore in 1219 bestowed a great charter of freedom upon the castle market. While Conrad took over the military protection of the town as a Burgrave, the citizens were able to attain an increasing autonomy in their internal affairs. Conrad also supported the emperor when he was banished. The death of Frederick II in 1250 was a heavy blow to the Hohenzollerns, because they now lacked their major support against the other German nobility. Between 1237 and 1239 Conrad was an administrator of the duchy of Austria together with the Counts of Henneberg and of Andechs, although for political reasons he often opposed these families. Among other territories, he acquired the Rangau with Ansbach, significant parts of the Pegnitz valley and gained control over the most important trade routes to Nuremberg. He successfully fought against the marauding knights and warded off the nobility. Family and children The exact name of his wife is not known. She may possibly have been Adelheid of Frontenhausen or the daughter of Frederick II, Count of Leiningen and Saarbr√ºcken. He had the following children: # Frederick III of Nuremberg (c. 1220 ‚Äì 14 August 1297, Cadolzburg). # Conrad IV of Nuremberg (d. 1314). # Adelheid (d. 1304), married before 8 July 1241 to Count Rapoto III of Ortenburg, Count Palatine of Bavaria. # Sophie (d. after 16 June 1276), married to Marquard of Arnsberg-Heydeck.

First published in 2001, it won the Philip K. Dick Award for that year. The novel has been rereleased by Orbit Books under the name Unto Leviathan. Overview The Argonos is a space-faring generation ship containing thousands of humans. The Argonos has presumably been traveling through space for centuries upon centuries. The original goal of the Argonos has been lost over time; no one on board can say for certain of their origins. A class-system has developed in which the commoners and poor serve in the lower levels and provide maintenance for the ship. By contrast, the upper-class maintain positions of power. A Bishop sits as the head of the Church which wields some influence over the people, and the Bishop himself is a member of the Executive Council which governs the Argonos. When a signal is received, a team aboard the Argonos prepare to make a landing on the first alien planet to be encountered in years. Plot The story is told by the reserved Bartolomeo Aguilera whose cunning and bravery contribute to the outcome of the novel. Born with physical defects, he has integrated prosthetic material into his body as compensation. Bartolomeo is a close friend and advisor of the Argonos' captain, Nikos. Within the first few chapters it is clear that Nikos is in an increasingly dangerous situation and that tensions on the ship are beginning to rise. Niko's credibility as captain is declining and many are ready for a new leader. Nikos informs Bartolomeo of news which may help to improve or reduce Nikos' position. While the Bishop's previous failed landing helped to place Nikos in good light, there seems little to improve Nikos' ordeal. A planet suitable for human life has been discovered. It is a short distance away and therefore a landing can be attempted, but more importantly, a signal has been sent from the planet. It is a basic signal offering no information as to who sent it or why. Nikos asks Bartolomeo to join the team which is to land on the planet, which the Bishop names Antioch. The team consists of representatives of the Executive Council, Bartolomeo included, and of the different classes on the ship. The crew, along with harvesters which are to collect and process materials for the Argonos, descend on the planet. They soon discover that Antioch appears to have been settled by humans at one time, but it has been deserted for a long time‚Äîdecades, if not centuries. Although the team visits only a handful of the city-complexes, there are presumably numerous cities around the planet. All of them contain enigmatic and crumbling structures. The first startling discovery the team makes foreshadows the epiphany of evil which looms over the Argonos for the latter part of the book. A number of human remains are found outside several of the city-complexes. The remains are all but decayed with only bones remaining, and the few intact skeletons they find reveal no apparent trauma or instance of a violent death. However, the second discovery haunts the team even after leaving the planet. The team enters a glass structure which at first reveals nothing about the world or its former inhabitants. In the structure, they uncover a staircase winding down underground to another chamber. At the bottom of the staircase lies a nightmare: in a vast room there are contained, on hooks and in chains, an unimaginable number of mutilated human skeletons, including a number of children and even (horrifyingly) some mutilated infants. The Argonos is contacted at once and the team decides it is time to leave. The Argonos prepares to leave orbit, but amongst the underclasses there is talk of settling on Antioch. Par, a friend of Bartolomeo asks him for his help in a planned insurrection; the common people of the ship's blue-collar \\"lower decks\\" desire to leave Argonos and live on Antioch in order to escape their lives of unending drudgery on the Argonos. Bartolomeo agrees to help and he obtains access codes for the bay-doors and shuttles. However, the operation is thwarted and fails miserably resulting in several participants, including Bartolomeo, being taken into custody. Bartolomeo soon discovers that Nikos knew about Bartolomeo's involvement and used it to his advantage and reassert himself as captain. Bartolomeo remains in prison for months on end until he is finally released along with all of the other prisoners. He stands before the Executive Council and defends his reasons for aiding in the operation. Under his advice, other political prisoners are pardoned. Bartolomeo's position as advisor is reinstated and he is updated on a new mystery which Argonos has come across. Unbeknownst to the planet exploration team, upon their entry into one of the buildings on Antioch, a signal from the building was sent deep into space. The team was never informed of this, but Nikos decided that the Argonos should travel to where the signal had been sent, which ended up being the location of the alien ship. There, this alien starship‚Äîa vast, immeasurable, structure far larger than the Argonos‚Äîlies dormant in the dead of space, and it appears just as silent and uninhabited as Antioch. Bartolomeo takes head of a team which has been attempting to explore the mysterious ship. There has already been a number of deaths and other unfortunate incidents among previous exploratory team members while exploring the ship. Bartolomeo therefore ensures that extra precautions are taken as he takes control. Some time after Bartolomeo assumes control of the operations aboard the alien ship, the mystery becomes even greater: a solitary old woman is found in a compartment of the ship which, unlike the rest of the explored sections, inexplicably has Earth-like gravity and air breathable to humans. At first, the old woman is unable to understand the languages used to communicate with her and speaks only in gibberish. She eventually begins to communicate with scientists in English. She says her name is Sarah and claims to have been from Antioch, and says the aliens saved her people, but can clarify nothing else in her delirious state. Upon Bartolomeo's urging, the Executive Committee decides that rather than continuing to explore the staggeringly huge vessel themselves, they will attach the ship to the Argonos and take it with them in hopes of delivering it to another human settlement with greater resources to continue the ship's exploration. This proves to be a horrible mistake as the true nature of the ship is revealed. Shortly after this decision is made, a young boy known by Bartolomeo sneaks aboard the alien ship, and Bartolomeo uncovers a horrifying part of the puzzle when he goes on board to bring the boy back to the Argonos: behind a door that the exploration team was not able to open on previous visits, Bartolomeo and the boy discover an enormous chamber containing horribly mangled corpses similar to the ones uncovered on Antioch, but in much greater quantity and more well-preserved because they had been frozen. It becomes clear that the aliens who committed the genocidal acts on Antioch were or still are on board the alien vessel, and were most likely its builders. While talking to the distraught boy, Bartolomeo has a sudden realization: How did the old woman know that they had named the planet \\"Antioch?\\" She is, as deduced by Bartolomeo, an alien. Bartolomeo calls an emergency meeting with the Executive Council and tells those taking care of \\"Sarah\\" to seal the room and sedate her. Once the \\"Sarah\\" realizes something new is happening, her human shape begins to change somewhat and she displays an extreme amount of strength while trying to break out of the medical room. She is eventually sedated and ejected into space, but not before momentarily transforming into something other than human. Attempts made to separate the alien vessel from the Argonos fail. Weapons have no effect. As panic begins to intensify aboard the ship, a final plan is devised. The residents on the Argonos will be crammed into the harvesters and shuttles, and they will travel back to the abandoned planet Antioch. To rid themselves of the aliens, Nikos and a few other trusted crewmen will remain aboard the ship and conduct a random jump out of the galaxy, possibly out of the universe, thereby taking the alien vessel with them. The plan is put into action and while the alien vessel struggles to free itself from the Argonos, the two star-ships are soon gone. The story ends with the convoy still on its way to Antioch, although Bartolomeo hopes for the future.

Named for its founder, Michael Olbrich, the gardens are owned and operated jointly by the City of Madison Parks and the non-profit Olbrich Botanical Society. The gardens were established in 1952. Noteworthy additions to the gardens were the Bolz Conservatory in 1991, and a Sala Thai, a gift to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison from the Thai Chapter of the Wisconsin Alumni Association and the government of Thailand through its king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Opened in 2002, it is one of only four sala outside of Thailand and one of two in the United States (the other is located in Hawaii).  Gardens and grounds  The only Thai pavilion in the contiguous United States The gardens are made up of several separate areas. The Sunken Garden is in the form of a traditional English garden. Surrounded by limestone terraces and hedges, it contains an long reflecting pool ‚Äì designed to connect the garden thematically with nearby Lake Monona. The Thai Garden contains the sala, which is joined to the gardens by a arched footbridge crossing Starkweather Creek. This garden has a shallow reflecting pool near the pavilion and is filled with small examples of Thai sculpture. The plants in this garden were carefully selected to give a tropical appearance to the garden in the summer, while choosing plants capable of surviving Wisconsin winters. A Rock Garden is constructed of a rocky hill, designed to simulate a mountain slope. Plants here are mostly conifers or alpine and two streams flow through it, forming a waterfall and small pond. Here again, a wooden footbridge crosses the stream. A Meadow Garden combines perennial grasses, wildflowers, and plants grown from bulbs. The grass in the meadow garden is mowed only once or twice a year. The small Wildflower Garden contains wildflowers, ferns, berries, and native trees and shrubs. An Herb Garden is a collection of smaller gardens of herbs separated by use; they include medicinal, dye, and kitchen (spice) herbs, as well as 'touch' and 'smell' gardens. A perennial garden displays perennials and three ponds, with a waterfall. Aquatic plants are displayed in the ponds. The Rose Garden is an ongoing project featuring more than 700 varieties and 125 rose cultivars, including hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras, and hardy shrub roses. The Starkweather Creek and Atrium Shade Gardens features a semicircular atrium and plants such as astilbes, hostas, lungwort, bishops' caps, and ferns. The Eunice Fisher Hosta Garden features hostas hybridized by Wisconsin-native, Eunice Fisher.  Bolz Conservatory  The Bolz Conservatory The Bolz Conservatory is a greenhouse housing over 750 plants representing over 70 families and over 550 different species and cultivars. The plants are native to tropical and sub-tropical regions. The structure itself is a glass pyramid measuring 100 by 100 ft (30 by 30 m) and rising to 50 ft (12 m) at the apex. The temperature is maintained between 65 and 80 degrees fahrenheit (between 18 and 26 ¬∞C), although the sun may warm it to 100¬∞F (35 ¬∞C) in the summer. The relative humidity is maintained at 70% or above. In addition to the tropical plants, the conservatory is home to species of birds including canaries, waxbills, diamond doves, Goldian finches and owl finches . There is also a koi pond, featuring koi and goldfish. Frogs, toads, and geckos are also present. While admission to Olbrich Botanical Gardens is free, a small fee is charged for entry into the conservatory.

It is found among Hindus of the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community. History The Baliga surname is used by families of the Goud Saraswat Brahmin community. Baliga is the written form of the surname, but in spoken language it is used as Bale or Ballo. The earliest documented evidence referring to a Baliga or Ballo can be found in the book The Goa Inquisition by Ananth K. Priolkar. During the Goa Inquisition in 1567, soon after the temples in Salcete had been destroyed, a meeting of its inhabitants was convened by the invading Portuguese and they were asked to disclose under oath the information regarding the properties held by the destroyed Hindu Temples. In the list of those who were present in one such meeting there is a Ballo named Naru Ballo.\\"The Goa Inquisition- Being A Quarter Century Commemoration Study On Inquisition On India\\" by Ananth K. Priolkar In 1637, at the flourishing rice port of Basrur (Barcelore in Portuguese Records) on the Canara Coast, a group of merchants expressed their unhappiness over the atrocities by local Portuguese officials to the Portuguese Viceroy of Goa, through a letter. The letter also said that if the problems continued they will leave the port city with their money. This letter was signed by Narayan Ballo, Shiv Ballo and Damo Ballo among other Saraswats and Jain merchants.\\"Studies on Indo Portuguese History\\" by Dr. B.S.Shastry The other notable mention is in The Ancient History of South Canara written by Ganapathi Rao Aigal, which mentions one Damarsa Bale, among nine other Samasthas (Noblemen) of Bantwal, signing a copper inscription of offering to Sri Bhadra Narasimha Temple of Manjeshwar. This inscription was created in the year 1747 A.D.Dakshina Kannadada Pracheena Itihasa; Ganapati Rao Aigal Today, there are families in Goa who use the surname Bale and their Gotra and Kuldev match that of the Manjeshwar Baligas. Since the actual form of the surname Baliga in usage in Konkani language is Bale or Ballo. Some historians claim that foot soldiers wielding spears were called Balle (Ballo for singular, Balle for plural). The soldier Ballo (Baliga) was under the command of the Nayak (Chieftain). The daily requirements of every family for survival, presentations, etc., were the responsibility of the Ballo. The faction of the Baligas that reside in current day Bantwal, called Bantwal Baligas, are said by some to have hailed from the Hegde family.

The frontal glacis plate was sharply sloped to improve protection. A radio antenna was mounted on the front right of the glacis. Development history M38 fitted with a turret from the Chaffee. One M38 was modified to take the turret of an M24 Chaffee tank and went through a series of tests to check a possibility of upgunning the vehicle.

Bartlett moved to Canterbury for the 1963‚Äì64 season where he was a member of the Burnside West Christchurch University Cricket Club then returned to Central Districts in 1966‚Äì67. He played his last first-class matches in the 1969‚Äì70 season. He also played for Marlborough in the Hawke Cup; in his first match, against Waikato in 1957‚Äì58, aged 16, he took 6 for 37 and 2 for 11 and hit the match top score of 52 not out.Waikato v Marlborough 1957-58 International career He toured South Africa in 1961-62, making his Test debut and playing all five Tests. He took only eight wickets but made useful runs (215 at 23.88) batting at eight or nine. He made only occasional Test appearances thereafter, all in New Zealand.

During the Christchurch Test the Indian bowler Syed Abid Ali protested against Bartlett's action by blatantly throwing the ball himself. Bartlett missed the next Test, but when he was selected for the Fourth Test, the Indian manager, Ghulam Ahmed, protested. According to the Nawab of Pataudi, \\"All the Indian players, including myself, considered Bartlett's action to be suspect.\\"Nawab of Pataudi, Tiger's Tale, Hind, Delhi, 1969, p.120.

Later he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw (1973-1978) in the sculpture department in the studios of Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz and Oskar Nikolai Hansen. His diploma was entitled Portret Totalny Karola Marksa (Karol Marx's Total Portrait) and was defended on July 5, 1978. He was later associated with the theater of Jerzy Grotowski, for which, during the period from 1976-1981, he designed posters. At that time, his first son was born and he worked at the quarry in Bor√≥w. Since 1986, he has been living in Rome, Italy.

He was decorated in Poland with Medal for Merit to Culture ‚Äì Gloria Artis. Most important works Karol Marks and KMB =Karl Marx= Portret Karola Marksa (Portrait of Karl Marx) was Bednarski's diploma thesis, which he defended in 1978 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. The author assembled a large photographic documentary collection and created Marx's head in many different sizes. The portrait was considered a critique of communist propaganda. Bednarski continues to create \\"Marxes\\" in various incarnations throughout his subsequent career as a total project adding objects to Marx's head or multiplying it typically as a commentary on social, political as well as his private life. Victoria-Victoria, 1983, marble = Signs and gestures = Signs is a series of monuments based on the left hand of the author. Maryla Sitkowska, a longtime critic and archivist of Bednarski's work, describes them as sculptures of the hand which makes a special gesture. For example, Ticket shows an extended hand presenting a ticket. The most famous of Bednarski's gesture is Victoria-Victoria, sculpture of victory sign with cut fingers created during the Martial law in Poland (1981-1983). One of the versions of this sculpture was created in 1983 in France during the sculpting symposium in Digne-les-Bains. The sculpture shows V sign (of victory and freedom), but with the fingers cut off. The first version of this sculpture was created in Poland couple of years before. Krzysztof M.

Installation, ship hull cut into 16 parts, steel ropes, sound. =Moby-dick= Bednarski writes about the series of Moby-Dick works: Working on Moby Dick completely changed my thinking about sculpture and space. There has been a rapid re-evaluation of my sculptural language [...] Suddenly I felt the \\"freedom opening\\". I knew that I found the foundation of my sculpture. In 1986, he found the hull of a large boat in the snow on the Vistula river which he thought resembled the white whale from the novel of Herman Melville. The hull was cut into sixteen parts, in the act of deconstruction, and was subsequently reconstructed in the attic of the palace on Krakowskie Przedmiescie Avenue in Warsaw. Until 2014, Moby-Dick was presented in over ten museum spaces, creating, according to Bednarski: completely new relationships stimulating interactions between the object and the place. The author writes that his works from the Moby-Dick series create a long lasting passage that led him through art and life. This series of works formed the basis of his doctorate at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 2014. = Portraits from shadows = In the summer of 1980, during the sculptural symposium Granit organized by Zag≈Çƒôbie Miedziowe (June 20, 1980 - August 20, 1980), Bednarski sculpted Krawƒô≈ºnik (A Curb) - sculpture dedicated to stonemason Jan Szeliga. The sculpture was created while working in the quarries of Gniewk√≥w and presents a schematic profile of the human head stretched over the entire length of the stone. The profile of Szliga's face is visible at the edge of the curb in the form of a shadow falling on the ground. The monument is currently exhibited in the village of Chocian√≥w. Later, this idea of shadow projection was applied by Bednarski in the monument to Federico Fellini Incontro con Federico Fellini made in 1994. \\"Vision and Prayer\\" based on Dylan Thomas, 1989.

Bednarski created a number of relief plaques, works on paper and canvas and sculptures that transform this motif. = Sphinx = Sphinx is a sculpture made from matchboxes. The author started to build it in early May 1984 during the economic collapse in Poland. Construction of the Sphinx required acquisition of about ten thousand matchboxes. At the time this represented an enormous effort, as they were rationed. In an ironic way, the Sphinx was dedicated to great builders from the Pharaohs to Joseph Stalin. The construction of the Sphinx took three months and the artist's mother said at one point: Son, I'm afraid for you, please leave these shitty matchboxes. I talked to your brothers, they will borrow the money and buy a marble block for you so that you can carve something decent. Nevertheless, the sculpture is currently in the Polish Sculpture Center in Oro≈Ñsko.

Pleasant, Ohio. The newspaper was originally Elihu Embree's The Emancipator in 1820, before Lundy purchased it the following year. Lundy's contributions reflected his Quaker views, condemning slavery on moral and religious grounds and advocating for gradual emancipation and the resettlement of freed slaves in other countries, including Haiti, Canada, and Liberia. The paper attracted few readers in Ohio, so Lundy moved his base of operations to Greeneville, Tennessee, in an attempt to spread his ideas in a slave state. Although the paper gained national circulation through twenty-one states, Tennessee slave owners were not very receptive to Lundy's publications, and he realized the newspaper could have greater impact on the east coast. In 1824, he moved The Genius to Baltimore, Maryland, where it would spend most of its publishing life. The paper would later be moved to Washington and then Philadelphia, and Lundy continued to publish irregularly until his death in 1839.  Editors  = Benjamin Lundy = Benjamin Lundy, considered by some as \\"The First Abolitionist\\", was born to Quaker parents in 1789, in Sussex County, New Jersey. Lundy was taught to be opposed to slavery at a young age. While working as a saddle maker in Wheeling, Virginia, Lundy witnessed the slave trade for the first time, thus beginning his career in abolitionism. At the time, the abolitionist movement had been losing momentum. In 1815, Lundy revived the movement by establishing The Union Humane Society, which sought gradual emancipation of slaves through legislation and to provide aid to freed slaves. Six years later, Lundy founded The Genius. The paper alternated between monthly and weekly publications, as Lundy spent much of his time traveling to give speeches or to other countries for potential freed slaves. While on a trip to Haiti, Lundy's wife, Esther, died in childbirth, leaving him a single father of twins. As Lundy found himself with less time to devote to the paper, he met William Lloyd Garrison, and offered him an editing position. After Lundy and Garrison parted ways over the \\"Black List,\\" Lundy began working closely with John Quincy Adams to establish freedman's colonies in Mexico, after Mexico abolished slavery completely in 1829. However, Texas revolted in 1836, and effectively ended any chances of such colonies being established. During this time, Lundy hired multiple assistants to keep the paper going, and its publishing regularity faltered. He moved the paper to Washington, then to Philadelphia, where it stopped publishing in 1835. In Philadelphia, he began publishing another newspaper, The National Enquirer and Constitutional Advocate for Liberty, until it too stopped scheduled publications and fell into financial trouble. Lundy decided to move to Illinois, where his family was, and was invited store his work and belongings in Pennsylvania Hall, which was used to host meetings about political topics, especially slavery. Lundy attended the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in Pennsylvania Hall, but on the second day of the convention, pro slavery pamphlets began circulating the city advocating for \\"property rights\\", and on the fourth day of the convention, disaster struck when an angry mob burned down Pennsylvania Hall, including all of Lundy's work and possessions. He moved to Putnam County, Illinois, built a small house and printing shop, and reestablished The Genius. Later that year, Lundy became very ill and he died on August 22, 1839, in debt and with few physical records of his abolitionist work remaining. = William Lloyd Garrison = In 1829, Lundy recruited the young William Lloyd Garrison to join him in Baltimore, Maryland, and help him edit the paper. Garrison's experience as a printer and newspaper editor allowed him to revamp the layout of the paper and free Lundy to spend more time traveling as an antislavery speaker. The two first met in Boston on one of Lundy's speaking tours; this meeting marked the start of Garrison's career in abolitionism. Initially, Garrison shared Lundy's gradualist views, but he eventually became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views, agreeing simply to sign their editorials to indicate who had written it. One of the regular features that Garrison introduced during his time at the Genius was \\"the Black List,\\" a column devoted to printing short reports of \\"the barbarities of slavery‚Äîkidnappings, whippings, murders.\\" One of Garrison's \\"Black List\\" columns reported that a shipper from Garrison's home town of Newburyport, Massachusetts‚Äîone Francis Todd‚Äîwas involved in the slave trade, and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to New Orleans on his ship Francis. Todd filed a suit for libel against both Garrison and Lundy, filing in Maryland in order to secure the favor of pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling and not in control of the newspaper when the story was printed.) Garrison was unable to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months. He was released after seven weeks when the antislavery philanthropist Arthur Tappan donated the money for the fine, but Garrison had decided to leave Baltimore and he and Lundy mutually agreed to part ways. Garrison returned to New England, and soon began his own abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator. Garrison would go on to lead the abolitionist movement right up until the Emancipation Proclamation. Even though Garrison and Lundy parted ways after his arrest, when Lundy died, Garrison said, \\"It is to Benjamin Lundy that I owe all that I am as a friend of the slave.\\"Nameplate from the October 1833 issue See also *Abolitionist publications  References  * Mayer, Henry.

For many years he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw where he earned numerous distinctions. He abandoned representational and realist painting midway through the 1950s and devoted himself entirely to abstract and optical effects. Acknowledging the concreteness of materials and colors, the artist, by his own admission, is mostly intrigued by the dual nature of light, how light is enclosed within a painting and yet somehow escapes it. According to the artist, each painting has a structure and a framework based on physical laws until it leaves the studio and becomes an enigma, at the disposition of the viewer, who discerns its content through a combination of emotional response and introspection. His paintings hang in major galleries in both Europe and the United States and in many countries throughout the world.  Biography  = Early years = Stefan Gierowski was born in Czƒôstochowa, but grew up in Kielce, where soon after his birth the Gierowski family moved. He came from a family of intellectuals, his father, Joseph Gierowski, was a doctor whose passion for painting has played an important role in cultivating his son's artistic talent. Artistic traditions in the family were also strongly present thanks to the figure of Antoni Gierowski, J√≥zef's uncle, who was a nineteenth-century painter and drawer. Patriotic traditions were equally important for the education of the young artist. From an early age, he showed interest in painting and a desire to perfect himself in it. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Stefan Gierowski together with his mother Stefania joined the Union of Armed Struggle (Polish: ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ), and later the Home Army (Polish: Armia Krajowa, AK) and actively participated in underground activities under the pseudonym \\"Hubert\\". In 1941, at the age of 16, he began underground artistic education under the supervision of Andrzej Ole≈õ, a well-known Kielce watercolourist, which he was forced to interrupt in 1944 because of his relocation to the Czƒôstochowa Inspectorate. = Study period = After the dissolution of the Home Army, Gierowski moved to Cracow, where he began parallel studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and the Faculty of Art History at the Jagiellonian University. The experience of studying art history proved to be crucial for young Gierowski in broadening his thinking about painting and art, thereby opening him to modernity. Under the supervision of Wojs≈Çaw Mole, he wrote a seminar paper entitled \\"Impressionism as part of French culture\\". Initially, the artist studied at the school of Prof. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jarocki, but after passing the clandestine classes conducted by Ole≈õ, he was transferred to the third year. He studied in the atelier of Zbigniew Pronaszko, a former formist, as well as Karol Frycz, where he studied painting in architecture and created stage designs. Classes and conversations with Frycz familiarised Gierowski with the art of Young Poland. He also met Jerzy Panek, Zbigniew Grzybowski, Stanis≈Çaw W√≥jcik and Andrzej Wr√≥blewski in his studio and at university. During his studies, he established cooperation with the social and literary weekly magazine \\"Wie≈õ\\", publishing an article on modern art, as well as illustrating subsequent issues. = Activity in the artistic community = After completing his studies, in 1948, Gierowski returned to his hometown of Kielce, where he began working as an advisor for art in the Culture Department of the Provincial Council. He also ran an art campfire at the Association of Polish Artists and Designers (Polish: ZwiƒÖzek Polskich Artyst√≥w Plastyk√≥w, ZPAP). In 1949 the artist was offered a job as a technical editor of the \\"Wie≈õ\\" magazine, which resulted in his move to Warsaw. In June of that year, an accidental meeting between the artist and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski took place at the National Museum in Pozna≈Ñ - fragments of Strzemi≈Ñski's texts on \\"Theory of Seeing\\" and unism were published in the \\"Wie≈õ\\" magazine. The next years are the heyday of family life: a marriage with Anna Golka and the birth of their two children - daughter Magdalena and son J√≥zef. At that time, the artist also illustrated novels by his friend, also a Kielceer, Edmund Niziurski - for example 'Ksiƒôga Urwis√≥w'. In 1951, Gierowski began working for an Artistic and Graphic Publishing House in the portfolios and albums department. In 1955 he took part in the International Exhibition of Young Artists at the Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art where his composition 'I Love Life' won second prize. This distinction inaugurated Gierowski's popularity and recognition as a new generation painter. This position was strengthened by the work 'Go≈Çƒôbnik' / 'The Dovecote' (1955), exhibited at the 6th Exhibition of the Warsaw District in November of the same year, gaining great popularity among critics. Also in 1955, in July the artist took part in the National Exhibition of Young Art entitled \\"Against War - Against Fascism\\", also known as \\"Arsenal\\", which turned out to be a generational exhibition of artists opposing the style of socialist realism. The artists he met there, including Andrzej Wr√≥blewski, Tadeusz Dominik, Magdalena Wiƒôcek, Marian Bogusz, Rajmund Ziemski, Jerzy Tch√≥rzewski, Jacek Sempoli≈Ñski and Alina Szapocznikow, have become long-time friends of Gierowski. Soon these artists were to become the leading art figures of their generation. In January 1957, the artist exhibited his works for the first time at the Krzywe Ko≈Ço Gallery, thus beginning a long and fruitful cooperation with Marian Bogusz and the Gallery's artistic circle. Whereas in February of the same year at the General Meeting of Delegates of ZPAP districts Stefan Gierowski was elected as a secretary. Together with the newly elected board, which included Jan Cybis, the President of the Association, and privately his friend, he started working on the new statute of ZPAP. The statute was completely reorganised and political or socialist elements were removed from it. His task was to reorganize the exhibition and popularization structures and animate artistic life in the country. Thanks to Gierowski's efforts, several dozen exhibition spaces subordinate to the association were opened throughout Poland. In the same year 1957, which proved to be a turning point for the artist's work, Gierowski began a series of Paintings numbered with Roman numerals. These works, shown at the Second Modern Art Exhibition at the Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art, brought the artist wide recognition among critics, including Julian Przybo≈õ and Zbigniew Herbert.. In the following years, Stefan Gierowski, together with Aleksander Wojciechowski and Marian Bogusz, joined the organizing committee of the Confrontation 1960, an event organized by the Krzywe Ko≈Ço Gallery, which was summed up on 8 September 1960 during the 7th Congress of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA). Together with Bogusz and Wojciechowski, he was responsible for the programme of the Confrontation, and also exhibited his own works as part of one of the exhibitions. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Stefan Gierowski repeatedly exhibited his works abroad - he participated in such artistic events as the first Biennale de Paris (1959), the 5th International Biennale of Contemporary Art in S√£o Paulo (1959) and 15 Polish Painters at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1961). As a result of the success of Polish artists at the Biennale de Paris in 1959, Gierowski, as the second Polish artist, was invited to create an individual exhibition at the Lacloche Gallery in Paris, which opened in April 1961. In the same year, persuaded by Marian Wnuk and Jan Cybis, Gierowski began working at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, taking up the course of Painting in Architecture at the Aleksander Kobzdej department. Shortly afterwards, in 1965, he opened his own atelier and began educating his students. His teaching style was characterised by a friendly approach, openness and a programme based on general painting issues such as colour or genre. Over the years, Gierowski's studio has produced over a hundred graduates, including Marian Czapla, Krzysztof Wachowiak, Jaros≈Çaw Modzelewski, Marek Sobczyk, Ryszard Wo≈∫niak, W≈Çodzimierz Pawlak, Tomasz Milanowski, Antoni Starowieyski and Jerzy Kalina. In 1975‚Äì1981 he was Dean of the Faculty of Painting, and in 1983 he was elected rector of the academy, but due to opposition from the martial law authorities, he did not take up his post. In 1980 he became an activist of the Academy of Fine Arts Solidarity, and in 1981 he was a member of the Organizing Committee of the Congress of Polish Culture. Later, in 1982‚Äì1988, he was a member of the General and Higher Education Council and the Council for Higher Artistic Education. In 1986 he obtained the title of full professor. Ten years later, in 1996, he retired from education. Until 1995, he maintained constant contact with ZPAP, having held the position of chairman of the painting section several times. Since 1996 he has lived and worked in Konstancin-Jeziorna near Warsaw.

He was the younger son of Count Friedrich II of Zollern, and became Count of Zollern as Friedrich III after the death of his other male relatives. Life From 1171 Friedrich I proved himself an adherent of the Hohenstaufen party, namely of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and his sons, Friedrich V, Duke of Swabia, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, and German king Philip of Swabia, and was party to the action by Barbarossa against Henry the Lion in 1180. Especially significant would prove the marriage of Friedrich, whose possessions at this time lay in the Duchy of Swabia, to Sophie of Raabs around 1184, the only daughter of Conrad II of Raabs, and heiress of the Burgraviate of Nuremberg. When he was granted the burgraviate by Henry VI after Conrad's death around 1191, he became the founder of both the Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern family, and of the Franconian line of the (later imperial) House of Hohenzollern, which he renamed Hohenzollern at this time to distinguish it from the House of Zollern. Through his wife, as the lone heiress of the Counts of Raabs and Abenberg, Friedrich was able to add possessions in Austria and Franconia, respectively, to his line.

Design  The design used a clamshell case (where the screen folds flat to the rest of the computer when closed), which was made from a magnesium alloy. The computer featured an Intel 8086 processor, a electroluminescent display, 340-kilobyte magnetic bubble memory, and a 1,200 bit/s modem. Devices such as hard drives and floppy drives could be connected via the IEEE-488 I/O (also known as the GPIB or General Purpose Instrumentation Bus). This port made it possible to connect multiple devices to the addressable device bus. It weighed 5 kg (11 lb). The power input is ~110/220 V AC, 47‚Äì66 Hz, 75 W. The Compass ran its own operating system, GRiD-OS. Its specialized software and high price (US$8,000‚Äì$10,000) meant that it was limited to specialized applications. The main buyer was the U.S. government. NASA used it on the Space Shuttle during the early 1980s, as it was powerful, lightweight, and compact. The military Special Forces also purchased the machine, as it could be used by paratroopers in combat. Along with the Gavilan SC and Sharp PC-5000 released the following year, the GRiD Compass established much of the basic design of subsequent laptop computers, although the laptop concept itself owed much to the Dynabook project developed at Xerox PARC from the late 1960s. The Compass company subsequently earned significant returns on its patent rights as its innovations became commonplace.  Production  Development began in 1979 and the initial model, the 1101, was introduced in April 1982; the model 1100 did not exist, except in marketing materials.. The computer was designed by British industrial designer Bill Moggridge.  Competitors  The portable Osborne 1 computer sold at around the same time as the GRiD, was more affordable and more popular, and ran the popular CP/M operating system. But, unlike the Compass, the Osborne was not a laptop and lacked the Compass's refinement and small size.

The forest is notable as the site of the Armistice between the Allies and Germany which ended World War I on 11 November 1918, as well as the Armistice of 22 June 1940 after the Battle of France in World War II. Geography The forest of Compi√®gne is roughly circular with a diameter of about ; it is approximately in circumference and its area is roughly . The forest is lushly irrigated, being adjacent to the Oise and the Aisne rivers, as well as many smaller tributaries and streams. On its northwest, the forest hugs its small namesake city, and to its north and northeast, beyond the Aisne, lies the large national forest of Laigue (For√™t Domaniale de Laigue). Around its remaining perimeter, it contains or is adjacent to numerous communes including Vieux-Moulin, Lacroix-Saint-Ouen, Saint-Sauveur, B√©thisy- Saint-Pierre, Saint-Jean-aux-Bois, and Pierrefonds. On its south it borders the Forest of Halatte. Just outside the city of Compi√®gne, a grand entrance to the forest begins at the resplendent Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne, a former royal residence on the city's western edge. Stretching forward from the ch√¢teau, the Avenue de Beaux Monts scales the heights of the same name, providing a scenic promenade into the woods. Characteristics Signpost in the Compi√®gne forest The forest of Compi√®gne is famous for its picturesque natural attractions, with its arrays of oak and beech trees projecting a \\"noble and ordered beauty\\". The most prominent tree species are oak (Quercus robur), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus). Much of the oak was heavily harvested over the centuries but was replanted aggressively in the nineteenth century when fears of deforestation began to be addressed. Since the late twentieth century, the North American black cherry tree (Prunus serotina) has spread vigorously throughout the forest, eliciting mixed reactions from local arborists. Numerous flowering plants thrive in the woods, notably large numbers of Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis). Small lakes, ponds, brooks and springs abound throughout the forest, including the Spring of Saint-Sauveur, which is actually a pair of therapeutic mineral water springs running both hot and cold. The forest sustains a great number of game animals including deer, rabbit and wild boar, and the varied terrain ‚Äì plateaus cut by valleys and gorges, hills, streams and ponds ‚Äì makes for challenging hunting. For centuries the Compi√®gne forest has been a prized hunting ground for virtually all the kings of France. Some 350 roads and pathways cross it adding up to over six hundred miles of trail with stately vintage signposts marking most of the intersections. The oldest ones include a small red mark which shows the direction to the ch√¢teau, relics of an imperial order given during the Second French Empire after the Empress Eug√©nie found herself lost in the thick woods. The forest of Compi√®gne is a popular destination for all types of tourists. Horse-riders and bicyclists particularly enjoy the forest; a long- running bicycle event, the Paris-Roubaix race, has an established path through the forest. Avenue de Beaux Monts, the promenade into the forest from the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne History =Prehistoric and classical eras= The forest of Compi√®gne area shows evidence of prehistoric habitation, and continuous forest cover has been definitively proven since at least the end of the Roman Empire. Gallic-Roman edifices have been discovered there, and it is traversed on its south and east sides by an ancient Roman road now called by the French the Chauss√©e Brunehaut. During the Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar won a decisive victory in the forest, defeating one of the larger tribes of north- eastern Gaul, the Bellovaci. A multitude of the forest's classical-era artifacts are on display at the Ch√¢teau's museum. =Dark Ages= The earliest Frankish kings established the forest as their privileged hunting grounds, and Clothaire the Great built the first royal residence there in the 7th century, and there he died of a fever.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum i, book IV. The small palace, fitted cozily among the trees, was named Cusia and for some time thereafter the forest itself went by the name For√™t de Cuise that is memorialized in the village of Cuise-la-Motte that lies to the east of the forest boundaries. A battle between the Merovingian-era kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria took place in the forest in the year 715. Most French monarchs enjoyed extravagant hunts at Compi√®gne. This 1811 oil painting by Carle Vernet depicts the Emperor Napoleon I at his sport. =Medieval era= As Empress Eug√©nie's signposts attest, the thick and heavy forest can be a disorienting and potentially fatal place. In the twelfth century, at the age of fourteen, the future King Philip II of France found himself lost in the forest: he came so close to tragedy that his father, Louis VII, felt compelled to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury in England to offer thanks for his recovery. In the sixteenth century, King Francis I commanded the construction of eight hard-surfaced roads through the forest, all of which converge on a single point called the King's Well (Puits du Roi). =Early modern era= Further avenues connected by an octagonal ring were opened through the woods for the formal hunting parties of Louis XIV, and under the Ancien R√©gime the number of rides was increased to 200. Napoleon opened the avenue of Beaux-Monts (illustration).Ren√© Gast, La Picardie (Itin√©raires de d√©couvertes, √©ditions Ouest-France), 2003:111. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the lush woodlands provided lumber for a thriving woodworking community around Compi√®gne. One of the most popular products supplied by the forest was beech oil, used for cooking and folk medicines: it was bottled in prodigious quantities and sold worldwide from Compi√®gne through the 19th century, until its marketshare was supplanted by newer, more refined oils.' =Second Empire= The forest of Compi√®gne witnessed much activity during the reign of the Emperor Napoleon III, for whom the abundant forest was a personal favorite retreat. The Emperor was an avid huntsman, and he reconstituted the forest as grand hunting grounds, even going so far as to revive the age-old office of Grand Veneur to oversee it. The Emperor had a deep affection for the forest and frequently organized his hunting parties at the King's Well. In addition to hunting parties and competitions, the forest of Compi√®gne was the scene of extravagant receptions, parties and even theatrical performances. =Armistices of 1918 and 1940= The forest of Compi√®gne was the site of the Armistice between the Allies and Germany which ended World War I on 11 November 1918. The French commander-in-chief Marshal Foch convened the armistice talks deep in the forest beside the tiny village of Rethondes, with an eye towards secrecy because he wanted to shield the meeting from intrusive journalists, as well as spare the German delegation any hostile demonstrations by French locals. During World War II, a second treaty was signed in the forest, this time arranging an armistice between France and Nazi Germany (22 June 1940). With an unmistakable desire to humiliate his defeated enemy, German dictator Adolf Hitler gave orders that the surrender should be received in exactly the same spot, even the same railway car, where the Germans had surrendered in 1918.

Armistice Clearing A memorial slab marks the location of the original railcar at Armistice Clearing. A memorial site called Clairi√®re de l'Armistice (\\"Glade of the Armistice\\", or \\"Armistice Clearing\\") covers the historic treaty area. Additions include a statue of Marshal Foch and the large Alsace-Lorraine Memorial, which depicts an Allied sword pinning down an Imperial German eagle. A famous memorial tablet placed at the precise location of the cease-fire signing reads (in French), Here on the eleventh of November 1918 succumbed the criminal pride of the German Reich... vanquished by the free peoples which it tried to enslave. The original tablet was destroyed by the Nazis, but a new one was emplaced after the war. For bringing the German delegation to the 1918 meeting, the French had assembled the train with a special saloon car which had once belonged to Napoleon III. The car was decorated with old Imperial emblems, redolent of past glories and mutely confirming the resurgence of French power after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The two sides then met in a newer railcar, supplied by Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, to sign the armistice. After the fall of France in World War Two, this same railway carriage was specifically used by the Germans for the armistice of 1940; it was remanded to Germany where it was eventually destroyed by SS troops in Crawinkel, Thuringia, in 1945, and the remains were buried. In 1950, a faithful replica of this original railcar was installed at the site. Decades later, some vestiges of the original car were discovered in Germany and returned to France: the pieces were added to the memorial display in 1995. The Armistice Clearing remains open to the public six days a week. Visitors routinely leave photographs and other mementos to be displayed or stored in the museum, making it \\"an ever-changing place of pilgrimage\\".

After starting his career at Lemnos (now the Shepparton Swans), Pratt played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League's (VFL) under-19s competition. He was awarded the Morrish Medal in 1953 for being deemed the \\"best and fairest\\" U-19 player that year. Pratt did not continue his footballing career to senior VFL level, instead focusing on other interests. Pratt combined study with acting with the Union Theatre Repertory Company and working as salesman for the family business, Visy Board. After touring London and New York in 1957 with a production of Ray Lawler's Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, playing the role of Johnnie Dowd, he returned to Melbourne and Visy. Following the death of his father Leon in February 1969 Pratt took over his father's business, which at that time had several hundred employees and an annual turnover of A$5 million. Business career Under Pratt's direction, Visy expanded from two factories in Melbourne to more than 55 plants across Australia, United States, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. From cardboard boxes and packaging, Visy moved into waste paper recycling. Later in the 1990s Pratt expanded his operations considerably into the New York waste paper business. In 1993 the National Crime Authority (NCA) raided Pratt's offices in connection with an investigation into businessman John Elliott's foreign exchange dealings and Elliott's spoiling domestic stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP, now BHP Billiton) while Elliott's company, Elders IXL, was insolvent. The following year, NCA paid costs and returned documents seized. Also in the 1990s, Visy was ordered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to pay a half million dollar fine for illegal anti-competitive behaviour. Public career As well as his business interests, Pratt was known for his involvement in public service, having held posts including: foundation chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology, president of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, and Chairman of the Board of Management of the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria. Through the Pratt Foundation, the Pratt family are among Australia's leading philanthropists donating up to A$10 million a year. Pratt was named Environmental Visionary of the Year in 1998 by the Keep Australia Beautiful Campaign. On 8 February 2007 he was appointed president of the Carlton Football Club. On 20 June 2008, the Carlton Football Club announced that Richard Pratt would stand aside from the club until the charges of giving false and misleading evidence to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission hearing were resolved. Pratt also donated considerable funds to both major political parties (for example A$300,000 in Financial Year 2004-5), as well as to former Australian Prime Minister John Howard's Liberal government. In 1996 an investigation by The Australian newspaper documented from internal company documents that Pratt maintained a multimillion-dollar network of advisors. This included an $8,333.33 a month fee to Bob Hawke for consultation on \\"Asian and government matters\\", $27,220.03 for travel to the US for Gough Whitlam as business advisor on overseas markets, and other sums for former state premiers Nick Greiner and Rupert Hamer. Personal life In 1959, Richard Pratt married Jeanne (n√©e Lasker), a journalist, who was also a Jewish immigrant from Poland and was born in the town of ≈Åowicz in Poland 1936, and before their marriage lived in Sydney. After the success of Visy Industries, they enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, with a private jet and a range of apartments, including a penthouse at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York City; their main home was the historic mansion Raheen, in the Melbourne suburb of Kew, the former residence of Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix. The Pratts have had three children, Anthony, Heloise Waislitz, who was married to businessman and Collingwood Football club Vice President Alex Waislitz, and Fiona Geminder. Another daughter, Paula, was born in 1997 to his longtime mistress, socialite Shari-Lea Hitchcock. In 2000 this affair became the subject of widespread media attention owing to a court case involving Ms Hitchcock and a nanny hired to look after her daughter. At the time, Pratt was accused of trying to pay hush money to the nanny who had launched legal action against Ms Hitchcock. Pratt was the godfather of Deborah Beale, who is the former wife of Bill Shorten and daughter of Julian Beale. After a well- publicised battle with prostate cancer, Richard Pratt died at his Kew residence on 28 April 2009, the day after all charges against him had been dropped due to his ill-health. Philanthropy He donated A$10 million every year through the Pratt Foundation to refugees, artists and others. The Foundation was established in 1978 by Jeanne and Richard Pratt as a vehicle for their philanthropy. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Pratts became known in Australia for funding the arts, medical research and higher education. Since then the Pratt family has donated about A$200 million to worthy causes. Conviction for price fixing In December 2005 the ACCC commenced a civil penalty proceeding against Visy companies, Pratt, and others, for alleged involvement in a cartel in the packaging industry.. On 10 October 2007, Pratt was formally accused of price fixing, cheating customers and companies out of approximately A$700 million in the nation's biggest-ever cartel case. The ACCC alleged \\"very serious contraventions\\" of the law and that these had been \\"carefully and deliberately concealed\\" by Visy senior executives. The ACCC counsel further stated: > \\"There can be no suggestion that Visy acted in ignorance of its obligations > under the act\\" and further added that the deliberate use of pre-paid mobile phones that could not be traced and the holding of meetings in private homes, motel rooms and suburban parks > \\"...provides a strong indication that Visy was fully aware that the conduct > was illegal\\". After more than a year of denials Pratt subsequently admitted his guilt, acknowledging he and his company, and \\"rival\\" company Amcor deliberately broke the law. Pratt was aggrieved by the criminal prosecution and its effect on his reputation, stating: > \\"I feel very angry‚ÄîVisy is seen as Richard Pratt's company‚Äîthere is a > certain amount of character assassination for me personally because I am a > tall poppy in the community; it's a big scalp (for the ACCC). My reputation > is something I have been building for 50 years and so I am worried that the > general public will now see me as a rich person who has made his money doing > something that is wrong in the eyes of the law.\\" On 2 November 2007, Pratt and the Visy group received an A$36 million fine, representing both the largest fine in Australian history and an estimated 0.75% of the Pratt fortune. Federal Court of Australia judge Justice Heerey said Pratt and his senior executives were knowingly concerned in the cartel, which involved price fixing and market sharing. \\"This is the worst cartel to come before the courts in 30-plus years\\", Justice Heerey said. Additionally, customers of Visy initiated claims against Visy and Amcor, including a $120 million suit by Cadbury Schweppes against Amcor. =Criminal prosecution for impropriety= On 19 June 2008, Pratt was charged with lying about his knowledge of a price-fixing scandal. Pratt had been facing four separate charges under Section 5 of the Act, the penalty for each charge ranges from a fine of $2,200 to 12 months' jail. On 27 April 2009, this criminal prosecution of Pratt for charges of impropriety (lying to the ACCC during its successful investigation into the Visy/Amcor price fixing scandal) were abandoned on account of his poor health and impending death. However, Commonwealth Prosecutor Mark Dean SC told the Federal Court the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) believed the prosecution would have succeeded. Pratt died the following day. Honours Pratt was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1985, and a Companion of the Order (AC) in 1998. Jeanne Pratt has also been appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia.Companion of the Order of Australia: PRATT, Jeanne, 10 June 2002. For outstanding leadership in the arts, for development of opportunities for young artistic talent on stage and in the orchestral field, and for service to the community through charitable and non-profit organisations. However, Richard Pratt returned his awards in February 2008 after he was fined A$36 million for price fixing.\\"Billionaire Richard Pratt surrenders Order of Australia awards\\", heraldsun.com.au, 25 February 2008. On 16 May 2007, he was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Medal for Corporate Citizenship. This is given to executives who \\"by their examples and their business practices, have shown a deep concern for the common good beyond the bottom line. They are at the forefront of the idea that private firms should be good citizens in their own neighborhoods and in the world at large\\". In April 2010, to mark the first anniversary of his death, the inaugural Richard Pratt Memorial Oration was delivered at the University of Melbourne by the president of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Professor Menahem Ben-Sasson. During the oration, Pratt was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from Hebrew University.\\"Richard Pratt to be awarded posthumous honorary doctorate from Hebrew University of Jerusalem\\", University of Melbourne, melbourne.edu; accessed 13 September 2016.

She is a prominent representative of the Constructivist movement in Poland. Life and career Her father came from a family of Latvian Germans and her mother was Russian. She spent her early years in Riga, then moved with her family to Moscow in 1915. From 1917 to 1920 she studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. She was a member of the Moscow Union of Artists with Casimir Malevich, Olga Rozanova, Vladimir Tatlin, and Alexander Rodchenko, among others. In 1920, Kobro married Polish artist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski (1893-1952). In the beginning of 1922, she fled to Poland and in 1924, obtained Polish citizenship. The couple established themselves in Szczekociny, but later lived near ≈Å√≥d≈∫, in Brzeziny and Koluszki, where they worked as teachers. In 1926, Kobro co-founded the Praesens Group with architects Bohdan Lachert and Szymon Syrkus, but left the group in 1929 over content differences. Kobro, Strzemi≈Ñski, painter Henryk Sta≈ºewski, and poets Jan Brzƒôkowski and Julian Przybo≈õ then founded a.r. group, an initialization that is usually interpreted as \\"Revolutionary Artists\\" or \\"Real Avant-Garde\\". She was instrumental in the establishment of the Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In 1932, she and her husband joined the Abstraction-Cr√©ation group. In 1937, Kobro signed the 1936 Dimensionist Manifesto published by Jean Arp, Marcel Duchamp, and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. Kobro was one of the most progressive interwar avant-garde artists. Under the influence of Constructivism, she rejected individualism, subjectivism and expressionism, and instead postulated the absolute objectivism of form. Her main aim was to build an abstract work of art, based on universal and objective rules discovered through experimentation and analysis. Her sculpture conceptualized infinite space, which was to be seen as uniform and without focal or reference points (such as the origin of a coordinate system). Therefore, she strove to organize space in such a way that it would not be divided into space enclosed within form and excluded from it, but instead for the work to coexist with space and to allow space to penetrate it. Kobro's unique spatial compositions had a considerable impact on various modern artists, among others on the Belgian sculptor and painter Georges Vantongerloo whose sculptures evolved in the course of the 1920s and 1930 under the influence of Kobro's work. Her works have been exhibited in a number of museums around the world including Centre Pompidou, Museo Reina Sofia, Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet Malm√∂, and Whitechapel Gallery.

Opa≈Çka was born on August 27, 1931, in Abbeville-Saint-Lucien, France, to Polish parents. The family returned to Poland in 1946 and Opa≈Çka studied lithography at a graphics school before enrolling in the School of Art and Design in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He later earned a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. He moved back to France in 1977. Opa≈Çka lived in Teille, near Le Mans, and Venice. He died at age 79 after falling ill while on holiday in Italy. He was admitted to a hospital near Rome and died there a few days later, on August 6, 2011, three weeks before his 80th birthday. Work Roman Opa≈Çka by Lothar Wolleh In 1965, in his studio in Warsaw, Opa≈Çka began painting numbers from one to infinity. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the canvas and finishing in the bottom right-hand corner, the tiny numbers were painted in horizontal rows. Each new canvas, which the artist called a 'detail', took up counting where the last left off. Each 'detail' is the same size (196 x 135 cm), the dimension of his studio door in Warsaw. All details have the same title, \\"1965 / 1 ‚Äì ‚àû\\"; the project had no definable end, and the artist pledged his life to its ongoing execution: 'All my work is a single thing, the description from number one to infinity. A single thing, a single life', 'the problem is that we are, and are about not to be'. He had contemplated and tried many different ways to visualize time before settling on this life's work. Over the years there were changes to the process. In Opa≈Çka's first details he painted white numbers onto a black background. In 1968 he changed to a grey background 'because it's not a symbolic colour, nor an emotional one', and in 1972 he decided he would gradually lighten this grey background by adding 1 per cent more white to the ground with each passing detail. He expected to be painting virtually in white on white by the time he reached 7,777,777 (He did not use commas or number breaks in the works): 'My objective is to get up to the white on white and still be alive.' As of July 2004, he had reached 5.5 million. Adopting this rigorously serialized approach, Opa≈Çka aligned himself with other artists of the time who explored making art through systems and mathematics, like Daniel Buren, On Kawara, and Hanne Darboven. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert and in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo. In 1968 Opa≈Çka introduced to the process a tape recorder, speaking each number into the microphone as he painted it, and also began taking passport-style photographs of himself standing before the canvas after each day's work. In 2007 Opa≈Çka participated at the symposium \\"Personal Structures Time-Space-Existence\\" a project initiated by the artist Rene Rietmeyer. The final number he painted was 5,607,249. Exhibitions Opa≈Çka participated in many of the art world‚Äôs most important international exhibitions, including Documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1977; the S√£o Paulo Bienal in 1987; and the Venice Biennale, in 1995, 2003, 2011 and 2013. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert, in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo and, for many years, at John Weber in New York. In 2003, Les Rencontres d'Arles exhibited his work through \\"L‚Äô≈ìuvre photographique\\"'s exhibition (the curator was Alain Julien-Laferri√®re). In 2017, Opa≈Çka has made part of the exhibition \\"Il mio corpo nel tempo / L√ºthi Ontani Opalka, Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Verona 2017. Catalogue Manfredi Edizioni. Collections Opa≈Çka's works can be found in the permanent collections of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and New York‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art among others. Recognition Opa≈Çka won the celebrated Grand Prize of the 7th International Biennial of Arts and Graphics of Cracow in 1969, the C. K. Norwid Art Critics Award in 1970, France ºs National Painting Prize in 1991 and Germany ºs Kaiser Prize in 1993. He was named Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and of Letters) in France. In 2009, he was awarded Medal for Merit to Culture - Gloria Artis by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski. In 2011, the President of Poland Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski awarded him with Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 2011 Opalka was awarded by the European Cultural Centre Art Award for his life long depiction of \\"Time Passing\\".

It published the essays, debates, speeches, events, reports, and anything newsworthy that related to the question of slavery in the United States and other parts of the world. Its audience were the members of the American Anti-Slavery Society and abolitionists in the north. Its two key focuses in the elimination of slavery were religion and politics, which considered slavery as an evil institution. Its strong religious appeal asserted that God was the only being that could end slavery. However, they did assign value to political action. The paper only contained six columns, but its personal accounts of slavery helped express the feelings and moods surrounding the controversy for thirty years.

The paper featured writings from influential abolitionists fighting for suffrage, equality, and most of all emancipation. One activist that was featured most was Charles Lenox Remond, a free elite African American minister who traveled the country speaking out against slavery. Other abolitionists included Frederick Douglass who gave powerful antislavery testimonies. Editors The paper had various editors: N. P. Rogers, 1840‚Äì1841; Lydia Maria Child, 1841‚Äì1843; D. L.

Background During the Russian Civil War (1917‚Äì1923), Cossack leaders and their governments generally sided with the White movement. As a result, the majority of Cossack soldiers were mobilized against the Red Army. As the Soviets emerged victorious in the civil war, many Cossack veterans, fearing reprisals and the Bolsheviks‚Äô de- Cossackization policies, fled abroad to countries in Central and Western Europe. In exile, they formed their own anticommunist organizations or joined other Russian √©migr√© groups such as the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS).Mueggenberg, Brent, The Cossack Struggle Against Communism 1917 ‚Äì 1945 (Jefferson: McFarland, 2019) 170 ‚Äì 189 The Cossacks who remained in Russia endured more than a decade of continual repression, e.g., the portioning of the lands of the Terek, Ural and Semirechye hosts, forced cultural assimilation and repression of the Russian Orthodox Church, deportation and, ultimately, the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33. The repressions ceased and some privileges were restored after publication of And Quiet Flows the Don (1934) by Mikhail Sholokhov. The Second World War After Adolf Hitler launched the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, several anticommunist Cossack leaders, including Kuban ataman Naumenko, Terek ataman Vdovenko, former Don ataman Pyotr Krasnov and the Cossack National Center chairman Vasily Glazkov, all publicly praised the German campaign.Mueggenberg, 224 Despite this outpouring of support, Hitler and other top officials initially denied Cossack √©migr√©s from having any military or political role in the war against the USSR. It was not until 1942 when Ostministrium openly began employing Cossack √©migr√©s for propaganda and administrative purposes.Dallin, Alexander, German Rule in Russia (London: Macmillan, 1981) 298 ‚Äì 302 While top Nazi officials were slow to embrace anticommunist Cossacks, some Wehrmacht field commanders had utilized Cossack defectors from the Red Army since the summer of 1941. In early 1943, most of the Cossack units fighting with the German Army were consolidated into the First Cossack Cavalry Division under the command of General Helmuth von Pannwitz. Later that year, the Cossack cavalry division was deployed to Axis-occupied Yugoslavia to fight Tito's Partisans. In late 1944, the division was incorporated into the Waffen-SS and expanded into the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps.Newland, Samuel, Cossacks in the German Army (Portland: Frank Cass, 1991) 112 - 121 Another Cossack group whose fate became tied with the Germans consisted of approximately 25,000 Cossack refugees and irregulars who evacuated the North Caucasus alongside the Wehrmacht in 1943. This group, known as ‚ÄúCossachi Stan‚Äù migrated between southern Ukraine, Novogrudek (Byelorussia), Tolmezzo (Italy) and was forced to withdraw to Lienz in Allied-occupied Austria, at the close of the war.Mueggenberg, 243 ‚Äì 244, 252 ‚Äì 254, 276 - 283 Yalta and Tehran Conferences Big Three: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at the Yalta conference. The agreements of the Yalta and Tehran Conferences, signed by American President Roosevelt, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Churchill, determined the fates of the Cossacks who did not fight for the USSR, because many were POWs of the Nazis. Stalin obtained Allied agreement to the repatriation of every so-called \\"Soviet\\" citizen held prisoner because the Allied leaders feared that the Soviets either might delay or refuse repatriation of the Allied POWs whom the Red Army had liberated from Nazi POW camps. Although the agreement for the deportation of all \\"Soviet\\" citizens did not include White Russian emigres who had fled during the Bolshevik Revolution before the establishment of the USSR, all Cossack prisoners of war were later demanded. After Yalta, Churchill questioned Stalin, asking, \\"Did the Cossacks and other minorities fight against us?\\" Stalin replied, \\"They fought with ferocity, not to say savagery, for the Germans\\". In 1944 Gen. Krasnov and other Cossack leaders had persuaded Hitler to allow Cossack troops, as well as civilians and non-combatant Cossacks, to permanently settle in the sparsely settled Carnia, in the Alps. The Cossacks moved there and established garrisons and settlements, requisitioning houses by evicting the inhabitants, with several stanitsas and posts, their administration, churches, schools and military units. There, they fought the partisans and persecuted the local population, committing numerous atrocities. The measures consisting of clearing the Italian inhabitants of the area from their homes and taking stern measures to not allow partisans from the hills to ‚Äúpass through alive‚Äù in the area lead the Italians to the use of the epithet ‚ÄúBarbarian Cossacks.‚Äù Naumenko, Volume 2, p. 23. When the Allies progressed from central Italy to the Italian Alps, Italian partisans under Gen. Contini ordered the Cossacks to leave Carnia and go north to Austria. There, near Lienz, the British Army kept the Cossacks in a hastily established camp. For a few days the British supplied them with food; meanwhile, the Red Army's advance units approached to within a few miles east, rapidly advancing to meet the Allies. On 28 May 1945 the British transported 2,046 disarmed Cossack officers and generals‚Äîincluding the cavalry Generals Pyotr Krasnov and Andrei Shkuro‚Äîto a nearby Red Army-held town and handed them over to the Red Army commanding general, who ordered them tried for treason. Many Cossack leaders had never been citizens of the Soviet Union, having fled revolutionary Russia in 1920;Naumenko, Great Betrayal and Great Betrayal, Vol. 2. hence they believed they could not be guilty of treason. Some were executed immediately. High-ranking officers were tried in Moscow, and then executed. On 17 January 1947 Krasnov and Shkuro were hanged in a public square. Gen. Helmuth von Pannwitz of the Wehrmacht, who was instrumental in the formation and leadership of the Cossacks taken from Nazi POW camps to fight the USSR, decided to share the Cossacks' Soviet repatriation and was executed for war crimes, along with five Cossack generals and atamans in Moscow in 1947.Naumenko, Great Betrayal, Volume 2, pp. 314-5. On 1 June 1945 the British placed 32,000 Cossacks (with their women and children) into trains and trucks and delivered them to the Red Army for repatriation to the USSR;Naumenko, Great Betrayal, Volume 2, reports various estimates, of which this number is among the highest. similar repatriations occurred that year in the American occupation zones in Austria and Germany. Most Cossacks were sent to the gulags in far northern Russia and Siberia, and many died; some, however, escaped, and others lived until Nikita Khrushchev's amnesty in the course of his de- Stalinization policies (see below). In total, some two million people were repatriated to the USSR at the end of the Second World War. Lienz On 28 May 1945 the British Army arrived at Camp Peggetz, in Lienz, where there were 2,479 Cossacks, including 2,201 officers and soldiers. They went to invite the Cossacks to an important conference with British officials, informing them that they would return to Lienz by 18:00 that evening; some Cossacks were worried, but the British reassured them that everything was in order. One British officer told the Cossacks, \\"I assure you, on my word of honour as a British officer, that you are just going to a conference\\". By then British‚ÄìCossack relationships were friendly to the extent that many on both sides had developed feelings for one another. The Lienz Cossack repatriation was exceptional, because the Cossacks forcefully resisted their repatriation to the USSR; one Cossack noted, \\"The NKVD or the Gestapo would have slain us with truncheons, the British did it with their word of honour.\\" Julius Epstein described the scene that occurred: The British transported the Cossacks to a prison where they were handed over to the waiting Soviets. In the town of Tristach, Austria, there is a memorial commemorating Gen. von Pannwitz and the soldiers of the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps who were killed in action or died as POWs. Other repatriations =Judenburg, Austria= On 1‚Äì2 June 18,000 Cossacks were handed over to the Soviets near the town of Judenburg, Austria; of those in custody, some ten officers and 50‚Äì60 Cossacks escaped the guards' cordon with hand grenades, and hid in a nearby wood. =Near Graz, Austria= The Russian Cossacks of XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, stationed in Yugoslavia since 1943, were part of the column headed for Austria that would take part in the Bleiburg repatriations, and they are estimated to have numbered in the thousands.Dizdar, 2005, p. 134 Nikolai Tolstoy quotes a telegram by General Harold Alexander, sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, noting \\"50,000 Cossacks including 11,000 women, children and old men\\".Tolstoy, 1986, pp. 124-125: \\"In a second telegram sent to Combined Chiefs of Staff, Alexander asked for guidelines regarding the final disposition of '50,000 Cossacks including 11,000 women, children and old men; present estimate of total 35,000 Chetniks ‚Äì 11,000 of them already evacuated to Italy ‚Äì and 25,000 German and Croat units.' In each of above cases 'return them to their country of origin immediately might be fatal to their health'.\\" At a location near Graz, British forces repatriated around 40,000 Cossacks to SMERSH.Vuletiƒá, 2007, p. 144 =Fort Dix, New Jersey, United States= Although repatriations mainly occurred in Europe, 154 Cossacks were repatriated to the USSR from Fort Dix, New Jersey, in the United States; three committed suicide in the US and seven were injured. Epstein states that the prisoners put up considerable resistance: =Marseilles, France= Cossacks were included in the hundreds who were repatriated to the Soviet Union from Marseilles in 1946.Naumenko, Great Betrayal, Vol 2, pp.197-205. =Rimini and Bologna, Italy= Several hundred Cossacks were repatriated to the Soviet Union from camps close to Venice in 1947. Some 100 Cossacks perished in resistance to forcible repatriations at Rimini and Bologna.Naumenko, Great Betrayal, Vol 2, pp. 205-19. =Liverpool, England= Thousands of Russians, many of them Cossacks, were transported at the height of armed hostilities in 1944 to Murmansk in an operation that also led to the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz.Naumenko, Great Betrayal, Vol 2, pp. 220-8. Aftermath The Cossack officers, more politically aware than the enlisted men, expected that repatriation to the USSR would be their ultimate fate. They believed that the British would have sympathised with their anti-Communism, but were unaware that their fates had been decided at the Yalta Conference. Upon discovering that they would be repatriated, many escaped, some probably aided by their Allied captors; some passively resisted, and others killed themselves. Of those Cossacks who escaped repatriation, many hid in forests and mountainsides, some were hidden by the local German populace, but most hid in different identities as Ukrainians, Latvians, Poles, Yugoslavians, Turks, Armenians and even Ethiopians. Eventually they were admitted to displaced persons camps under assumed names and nationalities; many emigrated to the US per the Displaced Persons Act. Others went to any country that would admit them (e.g., Germany, Austria, France and Italy). Most Cossacks hid their true national identity until the dissolution of the USSR in late 1991. =Amnesty= After the death of Stalin in 1953, partial amnesty was granted for some labor camp inmates on 27 March 1953 with the end of the Gulag system, then extended it on 17 September 1955. Some specific political crimes were omitted from amnesty: people convicted under Section 58.1(c) of the Criminal Code, stipulating that in the event of a military man escaping Russia, every adult member of his family who abetted the escape or who knew of it would be subject to five to ten years' imprisonment; every dependent who did not know of the escape would be subject to five years' Siberian exile. Legacy =In literature= The event was documented in publications such as Nicholas Bethell's The Last Secret: The Delivery to Stalin of Over Two Million Russians by Britain and the United States (1974).Bethell, Nicholas (1974) The Last Secret, Basic Books, New York. The first book written about the subject appears to have been Kontra by the Polish writer J√≥zef Mackiewicz, which was published in Polish in London in 1957.Burgh, Hugo de Investigative Journalism, Milton Park, Taylor & Francis 2000 p.243 Subsequently, in two volumes entitled Velikoe Predatelstvo (The Great Betrayal) published in 1962 and 1970 by a Russian language publisher in New York, Vyacheslav Naumenko, the former ataman of the Kuban Host documented the event. Neither the books of Mackiewicz or Naumenko were translated into English for decades after their publication and hence were almost completely ignored in the English-speaking world. The two volumes of Velikoe Predatelstvo were first translated into English in 2015 and 2018. Kontra has been republished several times in Polish, but has apparently never been translated into English. The first book written in English on the subject was The East Came West (1964) by the British author Peter Huxley- Blythe, but attracted little attention because of Huxley-Blythe's involvement with the European Liberation Front. The cover of The Cast Came West featured an image taken from a Nazi propaganda poster showing a demonical ape dressed in a Red Army uniform surrounded by fire and brimstone reaching out towards Europe. The first book about the subject published on official documentation was Operation Keelhaul in 1973 by the Austrian-born American author Julius Epstein, which was based on U.S. sources and primarily dealt with the American role in the repatriation. The subject of the repatriation was largely unknown in the English-speaking world until 1974 when Lord Bethell published his book The Last Secret, which was also turned into a BBC documentary that aired the same year.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 219 Bethell was critical of the repatriation, accusing the British government of \\"intentionally over-fulfilling\\" the Yalta agreement by handing over people who were not Soviet citizens, but was careful in his treatment of the evidence. The year 1974 also saw the publication in English of Aleksander Solzhenitsyn's book The Gulag Archipelago, where he mentions that many of the prisoners he met in Gulag in the late 1940s were veterans of the Vlasov Army repatriated by the British and Americans in 1945, a policy which he portrayed as craven and self-defeating.Knight Robert \\"Transnational memory from Bleiburg to London (via Buenos Aires and Grozny)\\" pages 39-53 from Zeitgeschichte, Volume 38, 2010 p.46 Through Sozhenitysn in The Gulag Archipelago did not deal specifically with the repatriation of the Cossacks, instead dealing with the repatriation of people to the Soviet Union in general, the book increased popular interest in the subject, as did his claim that Anglo-American policy towards the Soviet Union was driven in a fundamentally sinister and conspiratorial way, punishing the alleged friends of the West such as the Vlasov Army and the Cossacks while rewarding its enemies such as the Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn describes the forced repatriation of the Cossacks by Winston Churchill as follows: \\"He turned over to the Soviet command the Cossack corps of 90,000 men. Along with them, he also handed over many wagonloads of old people, women and children who did not want to return to their native Cossack rivers. This great hero, monuments to whom will in time cover all England, ordered that they, too, be surrendered to their deaths.\\"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: The Gulag Archipelago 1918‚Äì1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation, Parts I‚ÄìII. Harper & Row, 1974. pp. 259‚Äì260; The man who led and supervised the entire operation was Major Davies.Solzhenitsyn, A. (2018). The Gulag Archipelago. Random House. p.140 Subsequently, Count Nikolai Tolstoy published The Victims of Yalta in 1977, which was described by a critical historian, D.R. Thrope, as \\"a work of considerable scholarship\\". Nikolai Tolstoy describes this and other events resulting from the Yalta Conference as the \\"Secret Betrayal\\" (cf. Western betrayal), for going unpublished in the West.Tolstoy's (1977) book Victims of Yalta, Hodder and Stoughton, London, was reprinted in the US in 1978 as The Secret Betrayal by Charles Scribner, New York, and has been reissued in a Kindle edition under the title, Victims of Yalta: The Secret Betrayal of the Allies, 1944-1947. The 1970s were a period when d√©tente had became fashionable in some quarters and many on the right believed the West was losing the Cold War. The subject of the repatriations in 1945 were used by a variety of right- wing authors in the 1970s-1980s as a symbol of both of the malevolence of the Soviet Union and of a \\"craven\\" policy towards the Soviet Union alleged to have been pursued by the successive American and British governments since the Second World War.Knight Robert \\"Transnational memory from Bleiburg to London (via Buenos Aires and Grozny)\\" pages 39-53 from Zeitgeschichte, Volume 38, 2010 p.45-47 Reflecting the increased popular interest in the subject of the repatriations, which had become by the early 1980s to be a symbol of western \\"pusillanimity\\" towards the Soviet Union, a monument was unveiled in London on 6 March 1982 to \\"all the victims of Yalta\\".Knight Robert \\"Transnational memory from Bleiburg to London (via Buenos Aires and Grozny)\\" pages 39-53 from Zeitgeschichte, Volume 38, 2010 p.47 John Joliffe, a conservative Catholic British intellectual whose fund-raising help build the monument accused \\"the British government and their advisors of merciless inhumanity\\", and ignoring the fact that Churchill was a Conservative went on to blame the repatriations on \\"the hypocrisy and feebleness of progressive leftists who turned a blind eye to the communist enslavement of Eastern Europe.\\" In May 1983, Tolstoy published an article \\"The Klagenfurt Conspiracy\\" in Encounter magazine alleging a conspiracy by Harold Macmillan, the British \\"resident minister\\" for the Mediterranean, Field Marshal Harold Alexander and other British officials to hand over the Cossacks.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 220 In his article, Tolstoy alleged that on 13 May 1945 in a meeting in the Austrian city of Klagenfurt that Macmillan gave the orders to repatriate all Cossacks regardless if they were Soviet citizens or not. On 11 December 1984, Macmillan was interviewed on the BBC by Ludovic Kennedy and during the course of the interview Kennedy asked several questions about the Cossack repatriation in 1945.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 223 Macmillan seems to have been taken by surprise by Kennedy's questions, and the defensive tone of his answers certainly gave public the impression that he had something to hide. Several of Macmillan's statements such as he felt no guilt because the Cossacks were \\"rebels against Russia\\", \\"not friends of ours\\" and most damaging of all \\"the Cossacks were practically savages\\" did not help his reputation.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 224 In 1986, Tolstoy followed up his 1983 article with the book The Minister and the Massacres alleging a conspiracy led by Macmillan to deliberately hand over refugees from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia knowing full well they would be executed. As Macmillan went on to serve as prime minister between 1957‚Äì1963, Tolstoy's allegations attracted tremendous attention in Britain while also causing immense controversy. The architectural historian and interior designer James Lees-Milne wrote in his diary: \\"It was wicked to hang Ribbentrop, who was never a criminal. The man who deserved hanging was Harold Macmillan for sentencing all those Poles and Russians who were sent back after the war\\".Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 221 The novelist Robert Graves publicly stated: \\"Harold Macmillan, he's a murderer you know\\". There was a political edge to the attacks on Macmillan, who represented the left-wing of the Conservative Party, the so-called \\"one nation conservatism\\". The \\"one nation conservatives\\" such as Macmillan were often disparaged as the \\"wets\\" by the so-called \\"drys\\" who represented the right-wing of the Conservative Party. In November 1984, Macmillan gave a much publicised speech in which he called the privatisation plans of the Thatcher government ‚Äúselling off the family silver‚Äù, which made him into a hate figure for the \\"dry\\" Conservatives. Additionally, many people on the right-wing of the Conservative Party were passionately opposed to British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) as the European Union (EU) was then called. Through Britain did not join the EEC until 1973, it was Macmillan who as a prime minister first applied to have Britain join the EEC in July 1961, which was ended in January 1963 when President de Gaulle of France vetoed the British application. For many people on the British right, Macmillan is viewed as something alike to a traitor because of the 1961 application to join the EEC. In 1986, the Federation of Conservative Students in their magazine published a cover story with a photo of Macmillan from 1945 with the question \\"Guilty of War Crimes?\\"Knight Robert \\"Transnational memory from Bleiburg to London (via Buenos Aires and Grozny)\\" pages 39-53 from Zeitgeschichte, Volume 38, 2010 p.48 The question was rhetorical as the article accepted Tolstoy's charges against Macmillan and sought to link his \\"one nation conservatism\\" with a policy of weakness towards the Soviet Union.‚Äù In 1985, a British businessman named Nigel Watts became involved in a lengthy and bitter dispute over an insurance claim for the previous ten years with the Sun Alliance insurance company, whose chairman was Lord Aldington. In 1945, Lord Aldington had served as chief of staff of the V corps that carried out the repatriation. In consultation with Tolstoy, Watts wrote and published a pamphlet accusing Aldington of war crimes for his involvement in repatriating the Cossacks. In 1945, Toby Low as Aldington then was known was planning after leaving the Army to enter politics by running as a Conservative candidate for the House of Commons; Tolstoy has suggested several times that Aldington wanted the patronage of Macmillan, a rising star in the Conservative Party, and would do anything that might please Macmillan such as repatriating the Cossacks in accordance with his wishes. In response, Aldington sued Watts for libel, and Tolstoy insisted on being included as a defendant, seeing a chance to promote his cause. In response to The Minister and the Massacres, the British historian Robert Knight in his 1986 article \\"Harold Macmillan and the Cossacks: Was There A Klagenfurt Conspiracy?\\" accused Tolstoy of scholarly misconduct, writing that in May 1945 British policy in Austria was dictated by Operation Beehive, which entitled preparing for a possible war with Yugoslavia and perhaps the Soviet Union.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 222 In May 1945, the Trieste crisis almost caused an Anglo-Yugoslav war as Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia laid claim to the Italian city of Trieste while Britain supported retaining Trieste within Italy. As Yugoslavia was a Soviet ally in 1945, there were very real fears at the time that an Anglo-Yugoslav war could easily escalate into an Anglo-Soviet war. Knight argued that the forced repatriations in Austria undertaken in May 1945 were at least in part an effort to calm down a very tense situation. Knight maintained that the British wanted to clear Austria of all the vast number of prisoners they had taken to free up soldiers now struck guarding the prisoners for a possible war with Yugoslavia and to improve relations by returning peoples who were the enemies of the Yugoslav and Soviet governments. Both the Yugoslav and Soviet governments believed the British were intending to use Axis collaborationist forces such as the Cossack corps against them. To help resolve the raging controversy, Brigadier Anthony Cowgill formed a committee consisting of himself; a former diplomat and \\"Russia hand\\" Lord Brimelow, and Christopher Booker, a journalist well known for his conservative views.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 221-221 Cowgill believed that the honor of British Army had been smeared, but Booker was a supporter of Tolstoy when he joined the committee in 1986.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 221-222 Between 2 October-30 November 1989, the much publicised libel trial of Tolstoy vs. Aldington took place and ended with the jury ruling in the favour of the latter and awarding him ¬£1.5 million. The judgement, which forced Tolstoy into bankruptcy, was widely criticized as excessive and unfair. The way in which the Ministry of Defense supplied Aldington with certain documents that were denied to Tolstoy has been an especially controversial aspect of the trial, and Tolstoy continues to maintain that he was a victim of \\"the Establishment\\". Tolstoy retained a loyal set of defenders consisting of the Conservative MP Bernard Braine, the philosopher Roger Scruton, the journalist Chapman Pincher, the writer Nigel Nicolson, Lord Cranborne and from farther afield Solzhenitsyn, who was living in exile in the United States at the time.Burgh, Hugo de Investigative Journalism, Milton Park, Taylor & Francis 2000 p.250 The Tolstoy vs. Aldington case attracted much publicity as the British journalist Hugo de Burgh wrote: \\"From 1989 to 1993 a historical investigation became news in tabloid and broadsheet media alike as argument raged over the merits of combatants in a struggle over who might have done what over a few days in 1945. The case of \\"the Cossacks\\" has been perhaps the single most prominent example of historical investigation to be turned into journalism, not only in acres of newsprint devoted to the story and based upon several books on the subject, but also in a programme in the BBC historical series, Timewatch\\".Burgh, Hugo de Investigative Journalism, Milton Park, Taylor & Francis 2000 p.240 After four years of investigation, in October 1990 the Cowgill committee published its report, The Repatriations from Austria in 1945 whose conclusions largely echoed those reached by Knight in 1986 that British policy in Austria was largely governed by preparations for a possible war with Yugoslavia and perhaps the Soviet Union as well. About Tolstoy's allegations that Macmillan was a major war criminal, the Cowgill committee concluded that Macmillan's role in the repatriations was very small and largely dictated by military considerations. During its investigation, the Cowgill committee found copies of British documents that were not available in the Public Record Office among the personal papers of Alexander Comstock Kirk, a gay American diplomat who donated all of his personal papers from his death to the National Archives in Washington.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 226 In a column published in the Sunday Times on 21 October 1990, Robert Harris accused the Cowgill committee of a \\"whitewash\\", and maintained that Tolstoy's claims that Britain had willfully sent thousands of people to their deaths in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia was still correct. Cowgill sued Harris and the Times for libel and the case was settled out of court with the Times agreeing to donate to a charity of Cowgill's choice, in this case the Army Benevolent Fund. By contrast, the journalist Daniel Johnson wrote on 19 October 1990: \\"As Cowgill shows, Macmillan was telling the truth; that he had merely advised officers on the ground that Allied policy under the Yalta agreement was to hand back the Cossacks and he had, like everybody else, had been unaware that a large number of them were Russian emigres.\\"Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 227 In 1992, Sir Carol Mather, a veteran turned Conservative MP wrote in his memoirs Aftermath of War: Everyone Must Go Home that the overwhelming feeling shared by himself and other British Army officers in Austria in 1945 was that the Cossacks had willingly fought for Nazi Germany and had committed terrible atrocities against Italian civilians while fighting against Italian partisans in 1944‚Äì1945, meaning no- one had any sympathy for them.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 225 By contrast, Major Harold Lunghi who served as part of the British Military Mission in Moscow during World War Two and was closely involved in the talks to repatriate British POWs taken prisoner by the Germans who had liberated by the Red Army, remained highly critical of the decision to repatriate the Cossacks. Lunghi who worked closely with the \\"very ruthless\\" General Filipp Golikov recalled in an interview on 19 March 2009: > \\"In Moscow, as among most people who had knowledge and experience of Russia, > we were appalled to learn rather late in the day that we were forcibly > returning White Russians and others who did not hold Soviet citizenship to > the Soviet Union. It was all the more misguided because the Soviet side at > first did not lay any claim to them. As far as I recall, Golikov did not > initially refer to them at all. On the contrary, the Soviet side at first > said and wrote that their concern was Soviet citizens. We knew very well > what his, that is, Stalin's priority and why. The Cossacks and the others > were a late icing on the cake for Stalin\\".\\"Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of > Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 228 In 1997, Booker published his book A Looking Glass Tragedy, in which he wrote: \\"there was almost no part of the story which we found to be free from serious error, even to the point where atrocities and massacres described at length were found not to have taken place at all. Even the general belief that most of the Cossacks had died after their return to the Soviet Union turned out to be a wild exaggeration\\". In a review of A Looking Glass Tragedy, the British historian Alistair Horne alleged that four of the six massacres of Cossacks by the NVKD described by Tolstoy never took place and: \\"Of the Cossacks repatriated to Russia, few were actually killed; horrendous as their privations were, the vast majority survived the Gulag.\\" Horne argued that the \\"absurd\\" sum awarded to Aldington had made Tolstoy into a \\"national martyr\\", and felt that the case showed a need for reforming English libel law. Booker described the British media as suffering from a \\"Cleverdick Culture\\", accusing most journalists of being overtly motivated by the need to increase sales in a very competitive business via sensationalistic stories intended to promote public outrage and of being excessively credulous, especially about topics in which the journalists knew little, thus leading journalists to accept the Tolstoy thesis uncritically. Booker noted that the BBC produced 9 television or radio documentaries that largely accepted Tolstoy's allegations at face value, which he saw as an example of the \\"Cleverdick Culture\\". By contrast, Ian Mitchell in his 1997 book The Cost of a Reputation: Aldington versus Tolstoy : the Causes, Course and Consequences of the Notorious Libel Case argued that there had been an \\"Establishment\\" conspiracy against Tolstoy, claiming that the Foreign Office and the Defense Ministry had deprived Tolstoy of documents that had been helpful to him at this trial. The Cost of a Reputation was a book privately printed and paid for by Lord Portsmouth, an admirer of Tolstoy. The British historian Edwyn Morris in his 2008 essay \\"The Repatriation of the Cossacks from Austria in 1945\\" argued that for Churchill a major concern in 1945 was securing the return of all the British POWs in German POW camps who had fallen into Soviet hands as the Red Army advanced into Germany in 1944-45 and British policies on repatriation on people to the Soviet Union was dictated by the fear that Stalin might hold the British POWs as hostages. Morris argued that Churchill had a well founded belief that if the British granted asylum to the Cossacks, then the Soviets would not return the British POWs. Under the Yalta agreement, the Soviets were to repatriate American and British POWs that came into Red Army hands in exchange for the American and British governments were to repatriate people from the Soviet Union who fell into their hands. Morris argued that if Britain broke the terms of the Yalta Agreement by granting asylum to the Cossacks, then the Soviet Union might likewise break the terms of the Yalta agreement and refuse to repatriate the hundreds of thousands of British POWs whom the Germans had concentrated in POW camps in eastern Germany (it was German policy to build POW camps in eastern Germany as it made it more difficult for POWs who escaped to reach western Europe). Morris also maintained that since the Cossacks had fought for Germany, it was unreasonable to expect Churchill to sacrifice thousands of British POWs just to save them. As it was, the British POWs in Soviet hands were returned to the United Kingdom \\"humanely and expeditiously\\".Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 229 The British historian D.R. Thorpe in his 2010 book Supermac came close to accusing Tolstoy of scholarly misconduct, stating that the \\"White Russians\\" that Macmillan mentioned in his diary in 1945 were not the Cossacks as Tolstoy claimed, but rather the Russian Protective Corps, a collaborationist unit that fought for Nazi Germany whose men were either Russian emigres living in Yugoslavia or the sons of these emigres. Thorpe wrote that strictly speaking the term \\"White Russian\\" described any Russian who fought on the White side in the Russian civil war or those anti-Communist Russians who went into exile, but in British official circles in World War Two and in the British Army the term \\"White Russian\\" was used indiscriminately to describe any anti-Communist person from the territory of the modern Soviet Union, regardless if they were Russian or not.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 pages 220 Thus, the British called the Vlasov Army \\"White Russians\\" even through General Andrei Vlasov and his men were all former Red Army POWs who had decided to fight for Germany. Thorpe argued that this blanket use of the term \\"White Russian\\" together with a lack of qualified officers who could speak Russian ensured that the British in 1945 did not make much effort to distinguish between those Cossacks living in the Soviet Union who had volunteered to fight for Germany vs. those Cossacks living in exile who had volunteered to fight for Germany. Thorpe further argued that Tolstoy seemed unaware of the way the British used the term \\"White Russian\\" in World War Two and as he uses the term \\"White Russian\\" in the more limited sense, he assumes that the British were consciously repatriating people whom they knew were not Soviet citizens.Thorpe, D.R.

His journey to Transylvania and encounter with the vampire Count Dracula and his Brides at Castle Dracula constitutes the dramatic opening scenes in the novel and most of the film adaptations. Stoker appropriated the surname from his friend Joseph Cunningham Harker (1855-1920), a set designer at the Lyceum TheatreBram Stoker, Robert Eighteen-Bisang, and Elizabeth Russell Miller, Bram Stoker's Notes for Dracula, McFarland, 2008, p. 280. and father of actor William Gordon Harker (1885-1967) as well as great-grandfather of actress Polly Adams, whose actress-daughters Susannah Harker and Caroline Harker adopted the Harker surname for their stage names. In the novel Harker is a recently admitted solicitor from Exeter, England, who is deputed by his employer, Mr. Hawkins, of Exeter, to act as an estate agent for a foreign client named Count Dracula who wishes to move to London, England. Harker discovers in Carfax, near Purfleet, Essex, a dwelling which suits the client's requirements and travels to Transylvania by train in order to consult with him about it.Dracula Chapter 2 At Bistritz, Harker takes a coach to the Borgo Pass where at midnight another coach drawn by four black horses, waits to take him to Castle Dracula high in the Carpathian Mountains.Dracula Chapter 1 At the castle Harker is greeted by the mysterious and ominous Count Dracula and finalises the property transaction. Soon, however Harker realises he has been made a prisoner by his host who is revealed as a vampire. Harker also has a dangerous encounter with the three seductive Brides of Dracula, whose designs on him are only thwarted by the intervention of the Count. He promises to give Harker to them after his business deal is concluded and gives them a \\"wiggling bag\\" (highly presumed by Harker to be a human child) to appease them. Dracula leaves for England and abandons Jonathan in the castle as a meal for his vampire brides as he promised them.Dracula Chapter 3 Jonathan manages to escape, finding refuge at a convent. He suffers a mental breakdown after his experiences with the vampires; his fianc√©e, Mina Murray, comes to nurse him back to health with the nuns' help and marries him there. He returns home to England and later sees Dracula in London. After learning Dracula killed Lucy, he joins Van Helsing, Seward, Holmwood, and Morris. His clerical skills prove very useful for collecting information and for tracking down Dracula's London lairs by means of paperwork. He vows to destroy Dracula and, if he could, to send \\"his soul forever and ever to burning to hell[..]!\\" even if it be at the cost of his own soul. When confronted with Mina's curse, however, he is unsure how to react; Mina asks the others in the group to kill her if the need comes. While Harker says he would, in the privacy of his journal says that if it is necessary, that he would become a vampire himself out of his love for her. However, Harker manages to avoid that because along with Van Helsing and the others he manages to hunt down and destroy Dracula. At the book's climax, he pries open Dracula's coffin mere moments before sunset and slashes open Dracula's throat with a kukri knife, possibly decapitating him, while Quincey Morris stabs him in the heart with a Bowie knife. In a note following the end of the novel, it is revealed that seven years have passed. Jonathan and Mina have a son whom they have named after all four members of the party, but call Quincey, after Quincey Morris. Noting Quincey Harker's birthday is the day Quincey Morris died fighting Dracula, Mina likes to think that some of Morris's spirit is in their son. Jonathan Harker eventually visits Dracula's castle along with his wife and son and their surviving friends to reminisce. He returns home with his wife and son and is told by Van Helsing that one day his son will learn the whole story.

He manages to escape from the castle into a convent. His undead existence is finished by Dracula after he invites him into the convent. Dracula briefly wears his face as disguise. A few of the adaptions have Harker succumbing to vampirism (either from Dracula or the brides) and having to be killed. In most adaptations, Harker's role is reduced from that of the novel's hero and the focus (and sympathy) is drawn to other characters, notably Van Helsing or Dracula himself. While Harker and Mina are the central romance of the novel and Mina shares no other man's affections, she is often portrayed as Dracula's love interest and not as Harker's. In most adaptations it's usually Van Helsing or some other character, who kills Dracula, while Harker is either already dead by that time, or plays no role (or little role) in killing the vampire. =On stage= * In the Frank Wildhorn musical, Dracula, the Musical, Jonathan was played by Darren Ritchie in 2004 Broadway production.

Prepared by the first Russian consul to China, Ivan Zakharov, the treaty was preceded by a gradual Russian advance throughout the nineteenth century into Kazakhstan in direct competition with British efforts to impose self-advantageous trade terms on China. Historical context Cross-border trade became increasingly important to Russia and China in the 19th century with Russian merchants trading illegally at Kulja in Xinjiang‚Äôs Yili River Valley. In 1803, Tsar Alexander I attempted to negotiate the opening of the entire Sino-Russian border to trade. This effort failed, however, when the Tsar‚Äôs representative refused to kow-tow to a tablet representing the Emperor. Preceded by a gradual Russian advance throughout the 18th century into Kazakhstan, in direct competition with British efforts to impose self-advantageous trade terms on China, the treaty was signed on July 25th 1851 by the General of Ili and his assistant. Under its terms Kulja (Huiyuan and later Ningyuan) and Chuguchak (modern Tacheng) were opened to Russian trade. However the Qing court denied the Russian request to include trading in Kashgar. The treaty also allowed Russian merchants to trade and Russian consuls to reside in the Xinjiang towns of Yili (Huiyuan before 1863 and Ningyuan after 1882) and Tarbagatai. Russian trade with Xinjiang flourished and Alma Ata was founded in 1854 to become an important link in this trade. While the treaty primarily legalized ongoing practice, it also recognized the growing Russian presence in Central Asia. China‚Äôs defenses on this border had been greatly neglected since the start of the 19th century. The official text of the treaty was written in Russian, French and Manchu; the original treaty did not have an official Chinese version.

Initially the school was more technically oriented but has since diversified. The Eagles The Eagles is the name of the school magazine published by the school. School magazines have existed since the 1970s. The first school magazines were published monthly but however, it was then published annually. Students could express their ideas and their vision through the magazines. The Eagles at the time were very successful. One famous part of the magazine was the famous quotes by JKC teachers. The most recent magazine is Eagles 2013, a magazine which commemorated the 50 years of existence of the school. This magazine is the first one to be completely designed by the students themselves.

The film is loosely based on the 1980 Bhagalpur blindings. Gangaajal received considerable acclaim and was a success at the box office.  Plot  The film begins with Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) IPS Amit Kumar (Ajay Devgn) taking charge of the fictitious Tejpur District (West Champaran) in Bihar. The area is notorious for its crime rate, with Tezpur Police under the control of the local don Sadhu Yadav (Mohan Joshi) and his son Sundar Yadav (Yashpal Sharma). While travelling to the headquarters on the first day of his duty, Amit's car breaks down and he uses this as an opportunity to inspect the area. While touring the area, Amit observes a systemic rot in the administration of the place what with the professional laxity among police officials, crumbling infrastructure, outdated weaponry, lack of basic facilities like stationery and transportation and the dependence of the officials on corrupt local contractors for the same. Amit also finds that most of his subordinates are on the payroll of Sadhu Yadav and exchange favors. Amit tries to instill honesty and courage in his subordinates, but in vain. Inspector Bacha Yadav (Mukesh Tiwari), one of Amit Kumar's subordinates, who is a stooge of Sadhu Yadav visits his hideout and sees an infamous local goon Nunwa taking shelter there. Nunwa is found to have been underground all the while, after killing an officer in Bachcha Yadav's department, owing to a heated argument between them. Fearing that arresting him would open the lid on the nexus between Nunwa and the Tezpur Police, he kills Nunwa at Sadhu's behest and misleads the police and public into believing that he was killed in an encounter. Sadhu Yadav's purpose behind getting Nunwa bumped off is that he's trying to kill two birds with one stone, where killing Nunwa would eliminate the danger of the detection of his links with himself and the police force as also would help him to ingratiate himself with Amit Kumar. However, Amit sees through Sadhu's designs and chides Bacha Yadav for his cowardly act. He also warns Bacha that people like Sadhu Yadav are opportunists and fraternization with the latter merely due to belonging to his caste won't help him. He points out that Sadhu sold off Nunwa when he outlived his usefulness even when he sought refuge with him, and would do the same to Bacha some day. Amit puts Bacha off duty temporarily as a punishment and also tries to keep him away from Sadhu Yadav and Sundar Yadav. Anxious that he would be transferred from Tezpur, Bacha Yadav, seeking the help of Sadhu Yadav, visits his home, where he finds out that he is being ditched by Sadhu and vows to settle score with them. Meanwhile, Sundar manhandles a Public Works Department engineer for not heeding to his word during a tendering process. Amit takes notice of the incident and also finds that a girl is missing from her home after being kidnapped by Sundar. Sensing an opportunity, Bacha Yadav urges Amit to give him one more chance, who obliges him. Bacha Yadav tricks Sundar into a factory where Amit and his men are waiting and after a brief scuffle, Sundar is arrested and produced in a local court, where the judge acquits Sundar on the account of lack of evidence against him. Sadhu Yadav's men then try to vandalise the shop of a local pan vendor after he testified against Sundar, before being arrested and jailed in the police station. There, a fight arises between the accused and Bacha Yadav and his colleagues. It reaches an extreme point with Bacha Yadav and his colleagues piercing the eyes of the accused and pouring acid, referred locally as \\"Gangaajal\\", into their eyes. The incident raises a hue and cry in the local media, which accuses Police of vigilante justice. Angered by the incident, Amit Kumar orders his men involved to give their confessions in writing. Taking macabre inspiration from the incident, emboldened police officials in the vicinity conduct the same \\"experiment\\" on hardened criminals languishing in their jails. This creates an acute fear psychosis throughout Tejpur, with crime rates considerably lowering. The violent nature of this vigilantism finds support in the harrowed public of Tejpur which harbors simmering anger against the Yadavs owing to their bullyism and the general circumstances of deprivation in the town. \\"Gangaajal\\" becomes an instrument of extrajudicial \\"instant justice\\", to be meted out to the perpetrators of serious crimes. Any voice of dissent with regard to the practice is swiftly and violently shut down. While all officers, except Bacha Yadav, deny their involvement in the incident, Bacha Yadav writes his confession in a letter and submits it to Amit. When Bacha Yadav reaches his home, he finds his son and wife taken hostage by Sundar Yadav who, after a brief struggle, kills Bacha Yadav by shooting in his eyes. Enraged by the incident, Amit Kumar burns the confession letter of Bacha Yadav and issues a search warrant for Sundar and warns Sadhu Yadav to tell Sundar to surrender himself. Sadhu Yadav applies for an anticipatory bail for Sundar but before Sundar is produced in the court, he is arrested and is taken to jail. This time, the court rejects the bail application and orders the Police to keep Sundar in a 10-day custody. However, Sadhu Yadav influences local home minister and the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) (Mohan Agashe) of the area, Verma, to release his son which Amit Kumar stubbornly refuses to do. As a result, Amit is sent on an emergency leave. Meanwhile, an enquiry commission is set up to investigate the gross human rights violations under Amit Kumar's jurisdiction. While his subordinates including Tiwari, Khan, Pandey, deny involvement and plead their innocence, Amit unconditionally accepts responsibility for the incidents on moral grounds despite receiving overwhelming support from the populace of Tejpur. This perplexes his subordinates who find themselves helpless in the face of this situation. After being released, Sundar disrupts the marriage of the girl who he kidnapped earlier and kills her mother in the process. Unable to bear the loss of her mother and the torture at the hands of Sundar, she kills herself in the presence of Amit. Amit detains both Sadhu and Sundar and tries to take them to the police station. However, an enraged mob of locals stops Amit and demands that both be killed then and there itself by subjecting them to the same practice of gouging their eyes out and pouring \\"Gangaajal\\", before being convinced by Amit that anarchy can never be the answer to oppression and would only bring about social and moral decadence, which in turn would further engender authoritarianism. He insists that they would be tried as per the law. However, on the way to the police station, both Sadhu and Sundar, probably paranoid about their fate in prison, make a last-ditch attempt to escape by overpowering the guards and snatching their weapons . Amit then catches up with them as they hold a family hostage to ward him off. A brief fight takes place between them and the film ends with both Sundar and Sadhu getting killed by falling accidentally on the chisels of a plough, which incidentally pierce through their eyes.

The paper commenced publication on December 3, 1847, and ceased as The North Star in June 1851 when it merged with Gerrit Smith's Liberty Party Paper (based in Syracuse, New York) to form Frederick Douglass' Paper. The North Star's slogan was \\"Right is of no Sex‚ÄîTruth is of no Color‚ÄîGod is the Father of us all, and all we are Brethren.\\",  Inspiration  February 22, 1850 issue In 1846, Frederick Douglass was first inspired to publish The North Star after subscribing to The Liberator, a weekly newspaper published by William Lloyd Garrison. The Liberator was a newspaper established by Garrison and his supporters founded upon moral principles.David B. Chesebrough, Frederick Douglass; Oratory from Slavery, (Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1998), 16-18. The North Star title was a reference to the directions given to runaway slaves trying to reach the Northern states and Canada: \\"Follow the North Star.\\" Figuratively, Canada was also \\"the north star.\\" Like The Liberator, The North Star published weekly and was four pages long. It sold by subscription of $2 per year to more than 4,000 readers in the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. The first of its four pages focused on current events concerning abolitionist issues. The Garrisonian Liberator was founded upon the notion that the Constitution was fundamentally pro-slavery and that the Union ought to be dissolved. Douglass disagreed but supported the nonviolent approach to the emancipation of slaves by education and moral suasion.William S. McFeely, Frederick Douglass (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1991), 84-206. Under the guidance of the abolitionist society, Douglass became well acquainted with the pursuit of the emancipation of slaves through a New England religious perspective.William S. McFeely, Frederick Douglass (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1991), 15-16. Garrison had earlier convinced the Massachusetts Anti- Slavery Society to hire Douglass as an agent, touring with Garrison and telling audiences about his experiences as a slave. Douglass worked with another abolitionist, Martin R. Delany, who traveled to lecture, report, and generate subscriptions to The North Star. Editorial perspective and breadth Douglass's thoughts toward political inaction changed when he attended the National Convention of Colored Citizens, an antislavery convention in Buffalo, New York, in August 1843. One of the many speakers present at the convention was Henry Highland Garnet. Formerly a slave in Maryland, Garnet was a Presbyterian minister who supported violent action against slaveholders. Garnet's demands of independent action addressed to the American slaves remained one of the leading issues of change for Douglass. During a nineteen-month stay in Britain and Ireland, several of Douglass' supporters bought his freedom and assisted with the purchase of a printing press. With this assistance, Douglass was determined to begin an African- American newspaper that would engage the anti-slavery movement politically. On his return to the United States in March 1847, Douglass shared his ideas of The North Star with his mentors. Ignoring the advice of the American Anti- Slavery Society, Douglass moved to Rochester, New York to publish the first edition. When questioned on his decision to create The North Star, Douglass is said to have responded, > I still see before me a life of toil and trials..., but, justice must be > done, the truth must be told...I will not be silent.William S. McFeely, > Frederick Douglass (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1991), 146-147. In covering politics in Europe, literature, slavery in the United States, and culture generally in both The North Star and Frederick Douglass' Paper, Douglass achieved unconstrained independence to write freely on topics from the California Gold Rush to Uncle Tom's Cabin to Charles Dickens's Bleak House.Janet Neary and Hollis Robbins, \\"African American Literature of the Gold Rush,\\" Mapping Region in Early American Writing. Eds. Edward Watts, Keri Holt, and John Funchion. Athens: University of Georgia Press (2015), Besides Garnet, other Oneida Institute alumni that collaborated with The North Star were Samuel Ringgold Ward and Jermain Wesley Loguen. Douglass was assisted by philanthropist Gerrit Smith. Smith later merged his own anti-slavery paper with The North Star to create Frederick Douglass' Paper.

The agency was created on May 31, 1950 with the mission of developing and controlling nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the country. CNEA's facilities include the Bariloche Atomic Centre (in San Carlos de Bariloche), Constituyentes Atomic Centre (in Buenos Aires), and Ezeiza Atomic Centre (in Ezeiza, Buenos Aires Province). CNEA operates research reactors at each of these sites. History Officially established by President Juan Per√≥n's Decree No 10.936, CNEA filled the need for a state organ to oversee the funding of the Huemul Project in Bariloche. Before CNEA came into being, the project was funded by the Direcci√≥n de Migraciones. In practice CNEA had only four members (Juan Domingo Per√≥n, Gonz√°lez, Mend√© and Ronald Richter). In 1951, decree 9697 created another agency, the Direcci√≥n Nacional de la Energ√≠a At√≥mica (DNEA), also under Gonz√°lez, to do research on atomic energy in Buenos Aires (Gonz√°lez left CNEA in April 1952 and was replaced by Iraolagoit√≠a) until 1955. After being assessed by two review panels in 1952, the Huemul Project was closed and Richter was no longer a CNEA member. Research in physics and technology continued in Bariloche, but no longer along Richter's original line. Admiral Oscar Armando Quihillalt was the first director of the National Atomic Energy Commission, and was also an important participant in the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 1955, Jos√© Antonio Balseiro, a research scientist and member of the first review panel on the Huemul Project, took over the recently created Instituto de F√≠sica de Bariloche, now Instituto Balseiro, which used Richter's facilities in the mainland, but abandoned the buildings in Huemul Island. In 1956 Argentina's uranium resources were nationalized with the Commission controlling prospecting, production, and marketing. A yellowcake (uranium oxide) production capability was created that could support future plans for reactors. However, in accord with three presidential decrees of 1960, 1962 and 1963, Argentina supplied its initial production of about 90 tons of unsafeguarded yellowcake to Israel to fuel its Dimona reactor, creating the fissile material for Israel's first nuclear weapons. The facilities in Buenos Aires were expanded after the closure of the Huemul Project, and by the 1960s became larger in terms of size and expenditure than those in Bariloche. It was the Constituyentes research centre that the first Latin American research reactor was built (1957), the RA-1 Enrico Fermi. The 335-MWe Atucha I designed by Germany's (Siemens) was completed in 1974. In 1984 the 600-MWe Embalse designed by Canadian CANDU started its commercial operation. In 1995 CNEA's functions where divided into newly created separate organizations such as the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (Autoridad Regulatoria Nuclear - ARN), which supervises nuclear safety in the country, and the Nucleoel√©ctrica Argentina - NASA, the company that operates the two completed nuclear power reactors. Today, CNEA mainly focuses on research and development of nuclear and related technologies. In 2001 the original 1956 Directory structure of a President and five members designated by the National Executive authority was reduced, eliminating four positions of the Directory by Decrees 1065/01 and 1066/01. On 2010 CNEA reopened the Enriched uranium plant at Pilcaniyeu inaugurated on 198311 de noviembre de 1983: Anuncio del dominio de la tecnolog√≠a de enriquecimiento de uranio por el m√©todo de difusi√≥n gaseosa desarrollado por la CNEA con la colaboraci√≥n de la empresa INVAP S.E. en el Complejo Tecnol√≥gico Pilcaniyeu en la provincia de R√≠o Negro. but closed in the 1990sArgentina To Produce Enriched Uranium In 2011 In 2014 692-MWe Atucha II, also a Siemens design, started operating besides Atucha I. Since then Argentina operates three pressurized heavy-water reactors (PHWR), that use heavy water as moderator and coolant and unenriched natural uranium as fuel, for the generation of electricity. Also in 2014, CNEA begun construction of the world‚Äôs first small modular reactor (SMR), the CAREM-25 a small (25 MWe) pressurized water reactor (PWR) that unlike all previous power reactors in the country has been totally designed and developed domestically. It will use low- enrichment uranium as fuel and light water as coolant and moderator, a first for the country that traditionally used PHWRs designs. In December 2015 a new uranium enrichment plant to manufacture fuel for Argentina's nuclear plants, located in Pilcaniyeu, was inaugurated. The plant will use both gaseous diffusion and more modern laser techniques.  Research, development, production and educational activities  Centro At√≥mico Bariloche entrance.

The caustic is a curve or surface to which each of the light rays is tangent, defining a boundary of an envelope of rays as a curve of concentrated light. Therefore, in the photo on the side, caustics can be seen as patches of light or their bright edges. These shapes often have cusp singularities. Nephroid caustic at bottom of tea cup Caustics made by the surface of water Explanation The rays refracted by a non-flat surface form caustics where many of them cross. Concentration of light, especially sunlight, can burn. The word caustic, in fact, comes from the Greek Œ∫Œ±œÖœÉœÑœåœÇ, burnt, via the Latin causticus, burning. A common situation where caustics are visible is when light shines on a drinking glass. The glass casts a shadow, but also produces a curved region of bright light. In ideal circumstances (including perfectly parallel rays, as if from a point source at infinity), a nephroid-shaped patch of light can be produced.Circle Catacaustic. Wolfram MathWorld. Retrieved 2009-07-17. Rippling caustics are commonly formed when light shines through waves on a body of water. Another familiar caustic is the rainbow.Rainbow causticsCaustic fringes Scattering of light by raindrops causes different wavelengths of light to be refracted into arcs of differing radius, producing the bow. Computer graphics Photograph of a typical wine glass caustic Computer rendering of a wine glass caustic In computer graphics, most modern rendering systems support caustics. Some of them even support volumetric caustics. This is accomplished by raytracing the possible paths of a light beam, accounting for the refraction and reflection. Photon mapping is one implementation of this. Volumetric caustics can also be achieved by volumetric path tracing. Some computer graphic systems work by \\"forward ray tracing\\" wherein photons are modeled as coming from a light source and bouncing around the environment according to rules. Caustics are formed in the regions where sufficient photons strike a surface causing it to be brighter than the average area in the scene. ‚ÄúBackward ray tracing‚Äù works in the reverse manner beginning at the surface and determining if there is a direct path to the light source. Some examples of 3D ray-traced caustics can be found here. The focus of most computer graphics systems is aesthetics rather than physical accuracy. This is especially true when it comes to real-time graphics in computer games where generic pre-calculated textures are mostly used instead of physically correct calculations. Caustic engineering Caustic engineering describes the process of solving the inverse problem to computer graphics. That is, given a specific image, to determine a surface whose refracted or reflected light forms this image. In the discrete version of this problem, the surface is divided into several micro-surfaces which are assumed smooth, i.e. the light reflected/refracted by each micro-surface forms a Gaussian caustic. Gaussian caustic means that each micro-surface obey gaussian distribution. The position and orientation of each of the micro-surfaces is then obtained using a combination of Poisson integration and simulated annealing. There have been many different approaches to address the continuous problem. One approach uses an idea from transportation theory called optimal transport to find a mapping between incoming light rays and the target surface. After obtaining such a mapping, the surface is optimized by adapting it iteratively using Snell's law of refraction.Choreographing light: New algorithm controls light patterns called 'caustics', organizes them into coherent images = Optimal-transport-based caustic pattern design=  Basic principle  Controlling caustic pattern is rather a challenging problem as very minor changes of the surface will significantly affect the quality of the pattern since light ray directions might be interfered by other light rays as they intersect with and refract through the material. This will lead to a scattered, discontinuous pattern. To tackle this problem, optimal- transport-based is one of the existing proposed methods to control caustic pattern by redirecting light's directions as it propagates through the surface of a certain transparent material. This is done by solving an inverse optimization problem based on optimal transport. Given a reference image of an object/pattern, the target is to formulate the mathematical description of the material surface through which light refracts and converges to the similar pattern of the reference image. This is done by rearranging/recomputing the initial light intensity until the minimum of the optimization problem is reached.  Design pipeline  Here considering only refractive caustic, the objective can be determined as follows (similar principle for reflective caustic with different output): _Input:_ image of pattern to be obtained after propagating lights through the material, given the light source position. _Output:_ caustic geometry on the receiver (flat solid surface, e.g.: floor, wall, etc...) In order to achieve the target pattern, the surface where light refracts through and exits to the outer environment must be manufactured into certain shape to achieve desired pattern on the other side of the material. As mentioned, given an input image, this process will produce the similar caustic pattern as the output. In principle, there are two core stages with each includes two sub-stages: *Optimal-transport-based caustic designSolving Optimal Transport Problem *# Compute Target Light Distribution *#Compute Mapping from Initial Distribution to Target Distribution * Optimizing Target Surface *# Compute Normal Representation of Surface *# Surface Refinement  Solving optimal transport problem  As the case refraction occurs through a transparent surface, for instance the patterns appearing under clear water surface, 3 main phenomena can be observed: * Very bright (condensed light intensity) points (so-called singularity) * Curve-like objects that connect the points * Regions with low light intensity To perform computation, the following 3 quantities are being respectively introduced to describe the geometric characteristics of the pattern: point singularity Phi_{p} (measuring light intensity at certain highly concentrated light-point), curve singularity Phi_{c} (measuring light intensity at/around a light-curve), and irradiance measure Phi_{I} (measuring intensity in a certain poorly concentrated light-area). Putting them altogether, the following function defines the total radiant flux measure Phi_T at a certain section Œ© on the target surface: :Phi_T(Omega) = textstyle sum_{i=1}^{N_delta} Phi_{p}^i(Omega) + sum_{j=1}^{N_gamma} Phi_{c}^j(Omega) + Phi_I(Omega)displaystyle After this step, there are two existing measures of the radiant flux measures of the source Phi_{S} (uniform distribution, by initialization) and the target Phi_{T} (computed in previous step). What remains to compute is the mapping from the source to target. In order to do this, there are several quantities to be defined. Firstly, two light intensities evaluated by probabilities: mu_S (light intensity evaluated by dividing Phi_{S} by the flux of the union region between Phi_{S} and Phi_{T}), mu_T (light intensity evaluated by dividing Phi_{T} by the flux of the union region between Phi_{S} and Phi_{T}) are defined. Secondly, the source mesh is generated as multiple sites s_i in (Phi_S cup Phi_T), which is later being deformed. Next, a power diagram P_w (a set of C_i^w power cells) is defined on this set of sites s_i weighted by a weight vector omega. Finally, the goal is to decide whether which power cells are going to be move. Considering all x vertices on the surface, finding the minimizer omega_{min} of the following convex function will produce the matched power diagram for the target: :f(omega) = sum_{s_i in S} (omega_i.mu_S(C_i^0) - intlimits_{C_i^{omega}} (x - s_i^2 - omega_i)dmu_T(x))  Optimizing target surface  Computation Process After solving optimal transport problem, the vertices are achieved. However, this gives no information about what the final surface should look like. To achieve the desired target surface given the incoming light ray d_I, outgoing light ray d_O and power diagram from the step above, the surface normals representation can be computed according to Snell's law as: :n = d_I + {eta x over lVert d_I + eta d_T rVert} = d_I + {eta x over lVert d_I + eta {(x_R - x) over  x_R - x }rVert} where, :eta: refraction coefficient :x_R: target position obtained from solving above optimal transport problem As the normal representation is obtained, surface refinement is then achieved by minimizing the following compound energy function: :underset{x}{operatorname{arg,max}} , omega , cdot[ E_{int}, , E_{dir},, E_{flux}, , E_{reg}, , E_{bar} ] where, : E_{int} = sum_{v in M_T} lVert n_o - nrVert_2^2 is the integration energy that aligns the vertex normals n_o obtained from the Optimal Transport with the target normals n obtained from the Snell's law computation above. :E_{dir} = sum_{v in M_T} lVert x - textbf{proj}_{(x_S, ,d_I)}(x)rVert_2^2 as mesh generated in step Solving Optimal Transport cannot adapt to the sharp instances from the discontinuities, this energy is to penalize the vertices to not change significantly from the incoming light ray. : E_{flux} = sum_{t in M_T} lVert Phi_T(t) - Phi_S(t_s)rVert_2^2 is the energy measuring the flux over the triangle t in the mesh. : E_{reg} = lVert textbf{L}textbf{X}rVert_2^2 is the energy that regularizes the shape of the triangles to maintain its well-shapedness. : E_{bar} = sum_{v in M_T} lVert max(0, -log((1 - n_R.(x - x_R)) + d_{TH})rVert^2 is barrier energy to ensure that surface does not deform beyond a certain distance threshold d_{TH}. = Differentiable inverse rendering caustic pattern design =  Basic principle  Inverse graphics is a method to observe the data from image and infer all possible properties including 3D geometry, lighting, materials, and motion, thus generating realistic image. In conventional computer graphics, to render an image with desired appearance and effects, it is given all the properties/characteristics. This could be considered as the forward process. On the contrary, in caustic design, the properties and characteristics of objects (especially the material surface) are not trivial. The given constraint is the target image to obtain . Therefore, the goal is to get the properties and characteristics by observing and inferring the target image. This can be considered the inverse/backward process. The following is the basic loss function explaining how to optimize the parameters: :L(c) = lVert f(c)-I rVert^2 where, :: loss function, mean square error of the rendered image and the target :: contains elements which can influence the generated image :: target image  Designed pipeline  Differentiable inverse rendering caustic design At first, the target pattern is designed and compute the forward pass to get the synthetic pattern. It's compared to the target pattern and get the loss. The objection is to let the synthetic pattern is similar to the target pattern as much as possible. And then do the back propagation to get the optimized properties need to use in caustic manufacturing.  Elements contributing to generated image  * Appearance (A): per-pixel surface appearance is modeled as product of mipmapped texture and per-pixel brightness. * Geometry (V): assume a 3D scene to be approximated by triangles, parameterized by vertices V. * Camera (C): focal length, the point of view, the center of the camera. There could be more elements, for example albedo and refraction coefficient.  General differentiable framework  Introduce U as an intermediate variable indicating 2D projected vertex coordinate positions. The gradient of these properties can be derived by chain rule indirectly. : frac{partial f}{partial V} = frac{partial f}{partial U} times frac{partial U}{partial V} : frac{partial f}{partial V} = frac{partial f}{partial A} times frac{partial A}{partial V} : frac{partial f}{partial C} = frac{partial f}{partial U} times frac{partial U}{partial C} After applying the stochastic gradient descent, the optimal A, V and C could be achieved. Subsequently, these quantities are used to carve or mill the material to generate the target pattern.  Implementation  One common approach is to utilize the ability to perform differential operations in various deep learning auto- differentiation frameworks/libraries such as: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Theano. One more approach is to make use of the OpenDR framework to build a forward graphics model and to automatically obtain derivatives with respect to the model parameters for optimization. As optimization properties are obtained, the target image can be generated. OpenDR provides a local optimization method that can be incorporated into probabilistic programming frameworks. This can be used to solve the problem of caustic. = Manufacturing = Design and manufacturing process Once the caustic pattern has been designed computationally, the processed data will be then sent to the manufacturing stage to get the final product. The most common approach is subtractive manufacturing (machining). Various materials can be used depending on the desired quality, the effort it takes to manufacture, and the available manufacturing method. * Common refractive materials: Acrylic, Polycarbonate, Polyethylene, Glass, Diamond * Common reflective materials: Steel, Iron, Aluminum, Gold, Silver, Titanium, Nickel 231x231px Caustic pattern design has many real-world applications, for example in: * Luminaires * Jewelry * Architecture * Decorative glass production  See also  *Focus (optics) *Circle of confusion *Caustic (mathematics) *Voronoi diagram *Imperative programming *Parallel programming model  References  Further reading Geometrical optics ","title":"Caustic (optics)"},{"id":"3498699","text":"The Magician's House is a quartet of children's fantasy books by William Corlett. Two mini-series were produced in 1999 for British television, which were directed by Paul Lynch. The series featured Jennifer Saunders and Stephen Fry voicing some of the animal characters. The books were published in the early 1990s, and named as follows: #The Steps up the Chimney #The Door in the Tree #The Tunnel behind the Waterfall #The Bridge in the Clouds Although in a rural setting, this series' focus on subjects such as industrial development and the combining of present-day and past settings in the plotline gives it a feeling tending more towards urban fantasy than simply contemporary fantasy. In addition, though there is no specific mention of Welsh myths and legends, the strong part nature plays in the stories and the settings bring to mind other British children's authors. Authors like Alan Garner, who is perhaps best known for The Owl Service and Elidor, and Susan Cooper, famous for The Dark Is Rising sequence of books, who allude more specifically to British myth and legend in their writings. General Plot The four books centre on young siblings William, Mary and Alice Constant. They spend their holidays at Golden House, a large, 16th Century house in the British countryside. The house is not give a specific location except close to Wales. The books follow the children as they discover the secrets of Golden House and the Magician who once lived there. The events of the four books take place roughly over ten months; with the events of each book occurring during a traditional British school holiday period. Effectively, each book reflects a season: The Steps up The Chimney takes place during the winter and over the Christmas holiday; The Door in the Tree takes place in spring, during the Easter holiday; The Tunnel behind the Waterfall takes place during the long summer holiday; The Bridge in the Clouds takes place during the shorter autumn half-term. During these holidays, the children's parents are carrying out humanitarian work in the Third World, so the children stay with their uncle Jack and his partner Phoebe. The storylines of the respective books incorporate various ecological and animal rights issues, such as badger baiting, fox hunting and industrial development. In addition, the children fight against the Magician's evil assistant, Matthew Morden, whose quest for power leads him to disturb the magical and ecological balance within Golden Valley. Book 1 The Steps up the Chimney (1990)  The first book introduces the majority of the key elements of the series, such as the characters personalities, travelling within various animals and Golden House itself. Before the first chapter in each of the four books a map drawing is shown illustrating where the important aspects of that particular book take place. In this book the picture is of Golden House, and the surrounding Walled Garden with a dovecote in the centre. Book 1 begins with William, Mary and Alice arriving at Golden House for the first time during the Christmas Holidays. It's explained that Jack and Phoebe brought the house and plan to eventually turn it into a hotel, there is much work to be done and the majority of the house is not habitable. All three children dislike Jack's pregnant partner, Phoebe. She is presented as having a liberal attitude with a strong influence over Jack, where the children have a much more traditional and conservative outlook. The children find out Jack and Phoebe are vegetarian, and despite the children not being so, they are expected to respect their lifestyle while at the house. The children are also shocked that Phoebe is pregnant and the baby is expected shortly, consequently will be born out of wedlock. Whilst the children's developing relationship with Jack and Phoebe is explored so is the history of Golden House along with its current layout. While learning about and exploring Golden House they discover hidden steps at the back of the main fireplace, the steps lead to a secret room where they meet the Magician, Stephen Tyler. It's explained that Stephen Tyler is from 400 years previous, and he has the ability to travel to other times. An Elizabethan alchemist his work is focused around the art of Alchemy, however it is quickly established that he is not pursuing riches by making gold from the art. The Magician explains he needs the children's help and he will explain more about his work within the valley and what he hopes to achieve when the time is right. The remainder of the book focuses on the unexpected early arrival of Jack and Phoebe's baby during a snow storm. Golden House is isolated from the nearby town and consequently the baby has to be born in the house. While Jack and William set out in the storm to try to get help, Mary and Alice stay with Phoebe and try to protect her and the baby from an evil rat which is attempting to prevent the birth from taking place. While William is trying to get help he discovers he can speak to and travel with animals within the valley and he does this for the first time with a fox called Cinnabar. Alice also experiences this with a local stray dog called Spot (towards the end of the book Mary also travels with an animal, Jasper the Owl). Together they prevent the rat from interfering and a baby called Stephanie is born in Golden House by the fireplace. The Magician explains that the rat was being influenced by another Magician in his own time named Morden. It's explained that Stephanie and therefore Phoebe are distant descendants of Stephen Tyler and Morden does not want the Tyler family line to exist within Golden House. The holiday is over and the children leave the house, but are able to arrange for Spot to become the family dog before they leave. Book 2 The Door in the Tree (1991)  The map drawing in book 2 is essentially the same as what is in book 1 except everything has panned further out, so more of Golden Valley can be seen. Running through the centre of the map, through Golden house itself is a wide wood trail with a large tree in the centre. At the top a standing stone is shown and beyond that the beginnings of a lake. On the left hand side of the map is another wood trail which is narrower and leads to a quarry. On the right a parallel trail leading to a small house with four fields on either side. The children go back to Golden House to spend their Easter Holidays in Jack and Phoebe's care. Reflecting the drawing at the front of the book, they discover that the left path has become a dark and dangerous place where animals in the valley go to die. The right path leads to a small farm owned by Meg Lewis, an old lady whose family used to own Golden House. She lives alone and spends her time at the farm and looking after the nearby local badger set. The children discover a secret hideout at the top of an old yew tree, which is on a straight line that connects to the secret room at the top of Golden House. The threat in this book comes from modern day badger baiter's, they travel over England and take badgers from sets and force them to fight their dogs for sport. The Magician wants the children to stop trying to help the badgers and focus on the task he has for them, they ignore his request and he leaves them. It is eventually discovered that the baiter's have set up a fighting ring at the end of the dark and dangerous path within the quarry. The children, with the help of their animal friends, Meg, Jack and the local police manage to stop what is happening. It is revealed the Magician wanted the children to help the badgers all along, his work involves maintaining the natural order of Golden Valley in all time periods, seeing as the badgers are part of this order he is pleased they helped them. Book 3 The Tunnel behind the Waterfall (1991)  The map in Book 3 map is the same drawing as book 2's, but again it has been panned further out so a wider view can be shown. The only new elements this time is the rest of Golden Lake and the Golden Valley mountains beyond. It is the school Summer holidays and William, Mary and Alice are back at Golden House with this book focusing on the surroundings of Golden Lake. Morden is influencing his future descendants, the Crawdens, into buying the land surrounding Golden Lake and turning it into an amusement park on par with Disneyland. All the main characters including Stephen Tyler are dismayed by this news, as it would destroy Golden Valley and the natural order as they know it. Eventually the plans for the development are thwarted. Book 4 The Bridge in the Clouds (1992)  The map drawing in the final book once again pans further out, encompassing the entire valley and a large area of land nearby. Annotations on the map show who owns this land or what the land is called. When the children leave Golden Valley at the end of the Summer holidays, Morden increases his negative influence as his powers grow stronger. When the children return to the house in their Autumn school holidays they arrive to a depressingly evil place. The Magician accepts he is an old man and is not able to protect the valley forever, he explains he has been teaching the children all that he knows so that they might pass on this information and guide the newest Tyler at Golden House, Stephanie. A large battle between good and evil ensues, as the animals of the valley pick sides. There are multiple deaths, and Stephan Tyler is fatally injured. He eventually dies in his own time much to the upset of the children and the valley's animals. It's revealed towards the end of the book that Stephen Tyler's wishes likely come true, as a glimpse of the future is shown with Stephanie as a teenager still living at Golden House and exploring its secrets. It's also hinted that Stephanie and one of the Crawden descendants eventually become a couple and have children. Potentially with the two warring families coming together by blood and starting a new era at Golden House. However the book ends within the children's time concluding that they have much work to do before Stephen Tyler's wishes are eventually fulfilled. Television adaptation The television adaptation altered the relationship between the children slightly, with Mary becoming Jack's daughter and William and Alice's cousin. Her character is also considerably more argumentative and headstrong than in the books, as well as having apparently relocated from Canada to Jack's home country, as had Phoebe, who, like Mary, has a Canadian accent.

Pierre Yrieix Daumesnil (14 July 1776 in P√©rigueux - 17 August 1832 in Vincennes) was a French soldier in the armies of Napoleon during the first Empire and Restoration, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general. He participated in the Battle of Wagram, where he lost a leg which was replaced by a wooden prosthesis; hence his nickname jambe de bois (\\"wooden leg\\"). He was assigned to the defense of the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes in 1812. Vincennes was then an arsenal containing 52,000 new muskets, more than 100 cannon and many tons of powder, bullets and cannonballs--a tempting prize for the Sixth Coalition marching on Paris in 1814 in the aftermath of the Battle of the Nations. However Daumesnil faced down the allies and replied with the famous words \\"I shall surrender Vincennes when I get my leg back\\" (Je rendrai Vincennes quand on me rendra ma jambe, with a polysemic pun in French that is lost in translation). With only 300 men under his command, he resisted the Coalition until King Louis XVIII of France ordered him to leave the fortress. Daumesnil rallied to Napoleon at his return, again holding Vincennes against the large mass of Coalition troops. He managed to get a message to Royalist officer Louis-Victor-L√©on de Rochechouart asking for help. He then surrendered and five months later he was retired by the Bourbons. When the Revolution of 1830 began, he was recalled and given the rank of lieutenant general. He died of cholera on 17 August 1832. Napoleon III awarded his wife a pension and the position of superintendent of the imperial house of Saint-Denis.

Visitors used to be able to hike down into the main crater, but increased volcanic activity in 2014-17, resulting in large clouds of volcanic ash, has caused the surrounding Turrialba Volcano National Park to close. The stratovolcano is high and is about 45 minutes from the Atlantic slope town of Turrialba. The summit has three craters, the largest of which has a diameter of . Below the summit is a mountain range and montane forest, with ferns, bromeliads, lichens and mosses. Most of the forest is either primary or secondary forest. Turrialba is adjacent to Iraz√∫ and both are among Costa Rica's largest volcanoes. Turrialba has had at least five large explosive eruptions in last 3500 years. On clear days both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea can be seen from the summit. The volcano is named after its canton, Turrialba, in Costa Rica's Cartago Province. There is no clear consensus on the origin of the name Turrialba, but historians disagree with attempts to attribute the name to the patronym Torrealba (from Aragon in Spain) or from the Latin Turris alba (white tower). The general consensus is that Turrialba derives from the local Indian (Huetar language), but there is no agreement on its actual roots. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. Activity * During the 19th century, the volcano erupted and emitted ash several times (1847, 1853, 1855, 1859, 1866), producing pyroclastic flows. The last major eruption was in 1866. * Small signs of activity start in 1996. * In January 2001, the volcano reported increased activity, displaying strong fumarole activity at the central craters. The volcanic activities have increased since 2005. * On March 31, 2017, the volcano started to show some activity with ash eruptions. * The National Park area opened for visitors was closed from 2009 to 2011.

It had two series of 13 episodes each and each episode runs for 22‚Äì25 minutes. The series was loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's original 1883 novel Treasure Island. Featuring a mysterious and dark storyline, it incorporates magic and many new characters. Billy Bones is not in this series, instead Jim's father Mr. Hawkins is in his place. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom and in other countries throughout Europe and Asia and was also aired in Australia on ABC TV Network. The programme was a FilmFair production for Central Independent Television, The Legends of Treasure Island, is owned by ITV plc. Characters This cartoon, unlike most other Treasure Island cartoons and movies, featured the main characters as anthropomorphic animals: *Jim Hawkins: Dog: The main protagonist, he is cunning for his age, and determined to reach the treasure as his father asked him. *Ben Gunn: Dog: A hermit found living on the Island, he knows more about the dangers of the Island and is able to provide warnings. He frequently describes things as being \\"like a leech\\" and often speaks in very vague terms that can be hard to understand. *Long John Silver: Fox: Unlike the book and most adaptations, Long John Silver is not an anti-hero with dubious morality but rather a straight villain, although he does save Jim's life in episode 3. *Dr. Livesey: Dog: Is a friend of Jim and his father, and aids the boy against the pirates. *Captain Smollett: Dog: A brave captain who offers Jim his aid. When Jim states that he cannot pay Smollett, he states that he will accept a new pair of boots after they find the treasure as payment. He is also the one who decides to go to Squire Trelawney for funding, as the two are close friends. *Squire Trelawney: Giant Pigeon: Squire Trelawney is a friendly, yet money-obsessed character, who is only convinced to fund the expedition upon hearing the promise of treasure. He often acts as if he doesn't have a clue what he's doing, despite supposedly having gone on many adventures. *Blind Pew: Giant Rat: The mysterious blind boss of Long John Silver. *Jane: Vixen: One of the exclusive characters for this Treasure Island incarnation. Jane was kidnapped by Silver to be held for ransom, but since her parents did not want her, he got stuck with her. In the first episode, she switches sides and teams up with Jim, for whom she showed growing feelings as the series progressed. Subsidiary recurring characters included the pirates Morgan (a hog), Nebbich (a hyena), and Rat (who was, ostensibly enough, a rat). These characters featured mainly in the first season and only made minor appearances at the beginning of the second before disappearing altogether. Other minor pirates except Israel Hands seen during series 1 included a weasel and a rabbit among others. Voice talents = Series 1 = *Dawn French (Jim Hawkins) *Juliet Stevenson (Jane) *Richard E.

SSAFA health care and social work services support the Armed Forces community in 13 countries.  Structure and governance  SSAFA are governed by a board of Trustees who make and approve SSAFA policy. They oversee the Chief Executive Sir Andrew Gregory https://www.ssafa.org.uk/about-us/governance-ssafa and his Executive team who together look after to day-to-day management of the charity. SSAFA Trustees are all volunteers who contribute their time and expertise to the management of SSAFA. They have ultimate responsibility for directing SSAFA's affairs and ensuring the charity is solvent, well-run and meet objectives. All Trustees are also members of the Council and meet regularly to discuss the charity's activities and progress. The Chairman of Council is Lieutenant General Sir Gary Coward KBE CB.https://www.ssafa.org.uk/about-us/governance-ssafa SSAFA‚Äôs charitable work is financed by contributions from benevolent funds, generous donations from members of the public and the profits generated by their Health and Social Care department who are contracted by the National Health Service and Ministry of Defence to provide direct support to serving personnel and their families in the UK and overseas. History James Gildea founded the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association in 1885. In 1919, after the establishment of the Royal Air Force (in 1918), the organisation expanded support to become the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA). In 1997, SSAFA Forces Help was established when two charities, the \\"Forces Help Society\\" and \\"SSAFA\\", merged. On 10 April 2013, the charity's name changed to SSAFA as part of a rebranding aimed at improving awareness of the organisation's work amongst members of the armed forces community.

It consists of one transistor and two resistors, and the reference voltage across the circuit is determined by the selected resistor values and the base-to-emitter voltage (V) of the transistor. The circuit behaves as a voltage divider, but with the voltage across the base-emitter resistor determined by the forward base-emitter junction voltage. It is commonly used in the biasing of push-pull output stages of amplifiers, where one benefit is thermal compensation: The temperature-dependent variations in the multiplier's V, approximately -2.2 mV/¬∫C, can be made to match variations occurring in the V of the power transistors by mounting to the same heat sink.

Despite much investigation, the cause of UDN has not been determined. The onset of symptoms occurs after migration into freshwater. Affected fish develop severe skin lesions which begin on the head and back, and near the tail. Lesions become infected with overgrowths of fungi, such as Saprolegnia, giving the affected areas a slimy blue-grey appearance. The most severely affected fish frequently die before spawning. Although the worst effects of the disease were seen in the 1970s and 1980, even now large numbers of salmon will succumb to the disease after spawning. This is thought be due in part to their weak post-spawning condition, and lack of food for several months whilst in the river.

In graph theory, a circulant graph is an undirected graph acted on by a cyclic group of symmetries which takes any vertex to any other vertex. It is sometimes called a cyclic graph, but this term has other meanings. Equivalent definitions Circulant graphs can be described in several equivalent ways:. *The automorphism group of the graph includes a cyclic subgroup that acts transitively on the graph's vertices. In other words, the graph has a graph automorphism, which is a cyclic permutation of its vertices. *The graph has an adjacency matrix that is a circulant matrix. *The vertices of the graph can be numbered from 0 to in such a way that, if some two vertices numbered and are adjacent, then every two vertices numbered and are adjacent. *The graph can be drawn (possibly with crossings) so that its vertices lie on the corners of a regular polygon, and every rotational symmetry of the polygon is also a symmetry of the drawing. *The graph is a Cayley graph of a cyclic group.. Examples Every cycle graph is a circulant graph, as is every crown graph with vertices. The Paley graphs of order (where is a prime number congruent to ) is a graph in which the vertices are the numbers from 0 to and two vertices are adjacent if their difference is a quadratic residue modulo . Since the presence or absence of an edge depends only on the difference modulo of two vertex numbers, any Paley graph is a circulant graph. Every M√∂bius ladder is a circulant graph, as is every complete graph. A complete bipartite graph is a circulant graph if it has the same number of vertices on both sides of its bipartition. If two numbers and are relatively prime, then the rook's graph (a graph that has a vertex for each square of an chessboard and an edge for each two squares that a chess rook can move between in a single move) is a circulant graph. This is because its symmetries include as a subgroup the cyclic group Cmn simeq Cm√óCn. More generally, in this case, the tensor product of graphs between any - and -vertex circulants is itself a circulant. Many of the known lower bounds on Ramsey numbers come from examples of circulant graphs that have small maximum cliques and small maximum independent sets.Small Ramsey Numbers, Stanis≈Çaw P. Radziszowski, Electronic J. Combinatorics, dynamic survey 1, updated 2014.  A specific example  The circulant graph C_n^{s_1,ldots,s_k} with jumps s_1, ldots, s_k is defined as the graph with n nodes labeled 0, 1, ldots, n-1 where each node i is adjacent to 2k nodes i pm s_1, ldots, i pm s_k mod n. * The graph C_n^{s_1, ldots, s_k} is connected if and only if gcd(n, s_1, ldots, s_k) = 1. * If 1 leq s_1 < cdots < s_k are fixed integers then the number of spanning trees t(C_n^{s_1,ldots,s_k})=na_n^2 where a_n satisfies a recurrence relation of order 2^{s_k-1}. ** In particular, t(C_n^{1,2}) = nF_n^2 where F_n is the n-th Fibonacci number. Self-complementary circulants A self- complementary graph is a graph in which replacing every edge by a non-edge and vice versa produces an isomorphic graph. For instance, a five-vertex cycle graph is self-complementary, and is also a circulant graph. More generally every Paley graph of prime order is a self-complementary circulant graph.. Horst Sachs showed that, if a number has the property that every prime factor of is congruent to , then there exists a self-complementary circulant with vertices. He conjectured that this condition is also necessary: that no other values of allow a self-complementary circulant to exist. The conjecture was proven some 40 years later, by Vilfred. √Åd√°m's conjecture Define a circulant numbering of a circulant graph to be a labeling of the vertices of the graph by the numbers from 0 to in such a way that, if some two vertices numbered and are adjacent, then every two vertices numbered and are adjacent. Equivalently, a circulant numbering is a numbering of the vertices for which the adjacency matrix of the graph is a circulant matrix. Let be an integer that is relatively prime to , and let be any integer. Then the linear function that takes a number to transforms a circulant numbering to another circulant numbering. Andr√°s √Åd√°m conjectured that these linear maps are the only ways of renumbering a circulant graph while preserving the circulant property: that is, if and are isomorphic circulant graphs, with different numberings, then there is a linear map that transforms the numbering for into the numbering for . However, √Åd√°m's conjecture is now known to be false. A counterexample is given by graphs and with 16 vertices each; a vertex in is connected to the six neighbors , , and modulo 16, while in the six neighbors are , , and modulo 16. These two graphs are isomorphic, but their isomorphism cannot be realized by a linear map. Toida's conjecture refines √Åd√°m's conjecture by considering only a special class of circulant graphs, in which all of the differences between adjacent graph vertices are relatively prime to the number of vertices. According to this refined conjecture, these special circulant graphs should have the property that all of their symmetries come from symmetries of the underlying additive group of numbers modulo . It was proven by two groups in 2001 and 2002. Algorithmic questions There is a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for circulant graphs, and the isomorphism problem for circulant graphs can be solved in polynomial time.

Operation Disintegrins work by countering the blood clotting steps, inhibiting the clumping of platelets. They interact with the beta-1 and -3 families of integrins receptors. Integrins are cell receptors involved in cell‚Äìcell and cell‚Äìextracellular matrix interactions, serving as the final common pathway leading to aggregation via formation of platelet‚Äìplatelet bridges, which are essential in thrombosis and haemostasis. Disintegrins contain an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) or KGD (Lys-Gly-Asp) sequence motif that binds specifically to integrin IIb-IIIa receptors on the platelet surface, thereby blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the receptor‚Äìglycoprotein complex of activated platelets. Disintegrins act as receptor antagonists, inhibiting aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, platelet-activating factor and collagen. The role of disintegrin in preventing blood coagulation renders it of medical interest, particularly with regard to its use as an anti-coagulant. Types of disintegrin Disintegrins from different snake species have been characterised: albolabrin, applagin, barbourin, batroxostatin, bitistatin, obtustatin, schistatin, echistatin, elegantin, eristicophin, flavoridin, halysin, kistrin, mojastin (Crotalus scutulatus), rubistatin (Crotalus ruber), tergeminin, salmosin, tzabcanin (Crotalus simus tzabcan)Saviola, A.J., Modahl, C.M. and Mackessy, S.P., 2015.

Small Disintegrins: 49-51 amino acids, 4 disulfide bonds Medium Disintegrins: 70 amino acids, 6 disulfide bonds Large Disintegrins: 84 amino acids, 7 disulfide bonds Dimeric Disintegrins: 67 amino acids, 4 intra-chain disulfide bonds Snake Venom Metalloproteinases: 100 amino acids, 8 disulfide bond Evolution of disintegrin family Disintegrins evolved via gene duplication of an ancestral protein family, the ADAM family. Small, medium, large, and dimeric disintegrin family are found only in the family Viperidae, suggesting duplication and diversification about 12-20 million years ago. Snake venom metalloproteinases are found through the entire superfamily Colubroidea, suggesting that they evolved before Colubroidea diversified roughly 60 million years ago. Other sources of disintegrin proteins Disintegrin-like proteins are found in various species ranging from slime mold to humans. Some other proteins known to contain a disintegrin domain are: * Some snake venom zinc metalloproteinases consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain fused to a disintegrin domain. Such is the case for trimerelysin I (HR1B), atrolysin E (Ht-e) and trigramin. It has been suggested that these proteinases are able to cleave themselves from the disintegrin domains and that the latter may arise from such a post-translational processing. *ADAM and ADAMTS protein families, which include important protease enzymes. ** The secreted protease ADAMTS13, found in serum, cleaves Von Willebrand factor and acts as a natural, endogenous inhibitor of platelet adhesion and aggregation. ** ADAM2 (beta- fertilin, the beta-subunit of guinea pig sperm surface protein PH30). PH30 is a protein involved in sperm-egg fusion. The beta subunit contains a disintegrin at the N-terminal extremity. ** ADAM7 (Mammalian epididymial apical protein 1, EAP I). ADAM7 is associated with the sperm membrane and may play a role in sperm maturation. Structurally, ADAM7 consists of an N-terminal domain, followed by a zinc metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain, and a large C-terminal domain that contains a transmembrane region.

Evolution  Although originally a parlor song, the song had undergone the folk process by the time the Carter Family recorded it. For example, the first verse of \\"I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets\\" is whereas the Carter Family's \\"Wildwood Flower\\" begins In some versions, the order of the verses is changed, with the one ending in moved to the end, thus giving the impression that the woman has come to terms with her lost love and can move on. However, the final verse as originally written, clearly shows that the woman remains heartbroken, and thus preserves the sad, tragic nature of the song, rather than ending on an update, but ultimately false note.

Broadcast entertainment, series, cartoons, movies, sports programmings.  History  The channel began broadcasting on 1 February 1995 under the name VT4. The channel initially had no Belgian broadcasting license and was transmitted via London (actually from Arqiva's transmission station at Brookmans Park in Hertfordshire). Today, VIER broadcasts legally from Zaventem in Belgium. It is available on the cable network in Brussels as well as in Flanders. It's also available throughout Belgium on the IPTV network of Belgacom, who offers triple play everywhere in Belgium where VDSL is available. On 17 September 2012, VT4 was rebranded as Vier. HD broadcast Former VT4 HD logo VT4 HD was launched as a temporary high-definition channel on June 7, 2008 to coincide with the kick-off of UEFA Euro 2008. It was merely a simulcast of VT4's schedule, but the Euro 2008 matches and all related talk shows were broadcast in HD. VT4 HD was available exclusively to Telenet Digital TV subscribers and was shut down on June 29, 2008. On September 1, 2012 VT4 HD, along with sister channel VijfTV HD, launched as a HD simulcast. The channel was made available to Belgacom TV subscribers.

This makes it easier to transfer the program with the user's preferences and data between different computers. A program that doesn't have any configuration options can also be a portable application. Portable applications can be stored on any data storage device, including internal mass storage, a file share, cloud storage or external storage such as USB drives and floppy disks‚Äîstoring its program files and any configuration information and data on the storage medium alone. If no configuration information is required a portable program can be run from read-only storage such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs. Some applications are available in both installable and portable versions. Some applications which are not portable by default do support optional portability through other mechanisms, the most common being command-line arguments. Examples might include \`/portable\` to simply instruct the program to behave as a portable program, or \`--cfg=/path/inifile\` to specify the configuration file location. Like any application, portable applications must be compatible with the computer system hardware and operating system. Depending on the operating system, portability is more or less complex to implement; to operating systems such as AmigaOS, all applications are by definition portable.  Portable Windows applications  A portable application does not leave its files or settings on the host computer or modify the existing system and its configuration. The application does not write to the Windows registry nor stores its configuration files (such as an INI file) in the user's profile; instead, it stores its configuration files in the portable directory. Another requirement, since file paths will often differ on changing computers due to variation in drive letter assignments, is the need for applications to store them in a relative format. While some applications have options to support this behavior, many programs are not designed to do this. A common technique for such programs is the use of a launcher program to copy necessary settings and files to the host computer when the application starts and move them back to the application's directory when it closes. An alternative strategy for achieving application portability within Windows, without requiring application source code changes, is application virtualization: An application is \\"sequenced\\" or \\"packaged\\" against a runtime layer that transparently intercepts its file system and registry calls, then redirects these to other persistent storage without the application's knowledge. This approach leaves the application itself unchanged, yet portable. The same approach is used for individual application components: run-time libraries, COM components or ActiveX, not only for the entire application. As a result, when individual components are ported in such manner they are able to be: integrated into original portable applications, repeatedly instantiated (virtually installed) with different configurations/settings on the same operating system (OS) without mutual conflicts. As the ported components do not affect the OS- protected related entities (registry and files), the components will not require administrative privileges for installation and management. Microsoft saw the need for an application-specific registry for its Windows operating system as far back as 2005. It eventually incorporated some of this technology, using the techniques mentioned above, via its Application Compatibility Database using its Detours code library, into Windows XP. It did not make any of this technology available via its system APIs.  Portability on Linux and Unix-like systems  Programs written with a Unix-like base in mind often do not make any assumptions. Whereas many Windows programs assume the user is an administrator‚Äîsomething very prevalent in the days of Windows 95/98/ME (and to some degree in Windows XP/2000, though not in Windows Vista or Windows 7)‚Äîsuch would quickly result in \\"Permission denied\\" errors in Unix- like environments since users will be in an unprivileged state much more often. Programs are therefore generally designed to use the \`HOME\` environment variable to store settings (e.g. \`$HOME/.w3m\` for the w3m browser). The dynamic linker provides an environment variable \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` that programs can use to load libraries from non-standard directories. Assuming \`/mnt\` contains the portable programs and configuration, a command line may look like: \`HOME=/mnt/home/user LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/usr/lib /mnt/usr/bin/w3m www.example.com\` A Linux application without need for a user-interaction (e.g. adapting a script or environment variable) on varying directory paths can be achieved with the GCC Linker option \`$ORIGIN\` which allows a relative library search path. Not all programs honor this‚Äîsome completely ignore $HOME and instead do a user look-up in \`/etc/passwd\` to find the home directory, therefore thwarting portability. There are also cross-distro package formats that do not require admin rights to run, like Autopackage, klik (now called AppImage), or CDE, but which gained only limited acceptance and support in the Linux community in the 2000s. Around 2015 the idea of portable and distro independent packing for the Linux ecosystem got more traction when Linus Torvalds discussed this topic on the DebConf 2014 and endorsed later AppImage for his dive log application Subsurface. For instance, MuseScore and Krita followed in 2016 and started to use AppImage builds for software deployment. RedHat released in 2016 the Flatpak system, which is a successor of Alexander Larsson's glick project which was inspired by klik (now AppImage).Experiments with run-timeless app bundles by Alex Larsson (2007) Similarly, Canonical released in 2016 Snap packages for Ubuntu and many other Linux distros. Many Mac applications that can be installed by drag-and-drop are inherently portable as Mac application bundles. Examples include Mozilla Firefox, Skype and Google Chrome which do not require admin access and do not need to be placed into a central, restricted area. Applications placed into \`/Users/username/Applications\` (\`~/Applications\`) are registered with macOS LaunchServices in the same way as applications placed into the main \`/Applications\` folder. For example, right-clicking a file in Finder and then selecting \\"Open With...\\" will show applications available from both /Applications and ~/Applications. Developers can create Mac product installers which allow the user to perform a home directory install, labelled \\"Install for me only\\" in the Installer user interface. Such an installation is performed as the user.

He served as the caretaker coach of the Richmond Football Club for 11 games in 2009, and has served as the backline coach of the Melbourne Football Club since September 2011. Playing career =Hawthorn= Picked up very late in the 1994 AFL Draft at pick 94 by the Hawthorn Football Club, Rawlings developed into a very handy key position defender and occasionally, forward. He racked up 116 games for the Hawks before going into a contractual dispute at the end of 2003. =Western Bulldogs= He was picked up at number 1 in the 2004 AFL Pre-season Draft by the Western Bulldogs, who needed a tall forward, even though Rawlings was probably more at home in the backline. On debut with his new club, in Round 1, 2004, Rawlings booted 7 goals. However, in what would be a sign of things to come, he missed a relatively simple shot that may have cost the Bulldogs the game. Throughout 2004 Rawlings' kicking was woeful, sometimes kicking difficult goals along the boundary line but missing relatively simple goals (with a 50% accuracy rate). He was dropped to the VFL. In 2005 Rawlings did not fare much better, his knee troubles ruling him out for the Bulldogs after Round 14 of that year. Rawlings soon got into internal disputes at the club and was traded to his third club, the Kangaroos. =Kangaroos= Rawlings joined his brother Brady at the Kangaroos and was believed to be one of the reasons for moving to the club. After his recruitment, coach Dean Laidley did not guarantee Rawlings a senior game in 2006, saying he had to earn his spot. Jade played most of the year in 2006 with the Tasmanian Devils Football Club in the VFL showing some good form. After playing just two games in the 2006 season, Rawlings announced that he would retire after the Round 21 game against one of his former clubs, Hawthorn, despite an interview on Before the Game the week prior which had little no hint of retirement, although he did say his \\"knees weren't too flash\\" ‚Äì a problem which hampered him during the 2005 season. His final game was played in his home state of Tasmania (at Aurora Stadium), a match where Rawlings was visibly emotional, as he was well respected by the Hawthorn and Kangaroos sides. Coaching career For three seasons beginning in 2007Jade Rawlings. Fox Sports 6 June 2009  Retrieved 26 March 2013 Rawlings was an assistant coach at the Richmond Football Club, as well as head coach at Richmond's VFL affiliate club, the Coburg Tigers. Part of the way through 2009 he was replaced at Coburg by former Brisbane Lions player Craig McRae, when after Round 11 he was appointed caretaker coach of Richmond following the resignation of Terry Wallace.Tigers name Jade Rawlings new coach. ninemsn 6 June 2009  Retrieved 26 March 2013 His first game as Richmond coach was a victory against the West Coast Eagles. Rawlings has been dubbed \\"The Blade\\" because of 5 cuts he made to the lineup for his first game as coach, including veteran Joel Bowden. However, on 25 August 2009 the Richmond Football Club appointed Damien Hardwick as their new senior coach and Rawlings was not retained for the 2010 season. Rawlings was an assistant coach at the Brisbane Lions under Michael Voss for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Rawlings became the backline coach at Melbourne Football Club from the 2012 season. Personal life Rawlings was married to Samantha Richardson (sister of former Richmond player Matthew Richardson). They have two children called Gabriella and Andie, he also has two children with new wife Sallee called Macey and Ed Rawlings also has a brother, Brady, who played for the North Melbourne Football Club. In the latter stages of Rawlings' career he was drafted by the Kangaroos and played alongside his brother.

History  The communal territory was already settled during the Neolithic age, and later was a Roman colony, under the name of Bitunia. From the 11th century it was a fief of the bishops of Piacenza, and later of the Malaspina. In 1257 it was included in the State of the Landi, to which it belonged until 1682, when it was confiscated by the Duchy of Parma. During the Unification of Italy, the population was protagonist of an insurrectionary movement for the annexation of the country to Piedmont. In recent times Bedonia has been given an important role as a remembrance community that contributed to the Partisan fights (during World War II). In the life of Bedonia an important role of cultural promotion has been carried out from the Seminary, instituted in 1846 from Mons. Giovanni Agazzi and Stefano Grapnels.  Main sights  The city, just a few miles away from Liguria, is characterized by colorful buildings of obvious Ligurian influence. The city has two important churches: Sant'Antonino, a Baroque church in the historical center, and the Basilica della Madonna di San Marco, which is next to the Seminario Vescovile (built in 1846). In it there is a Planetarium, a Museum of Natural History, a Xylographic Exposition of the works of Romeo Musa, an Art Gallery and a gigantic National Library. A third church, the Oratorio dei Disciplinati, added its bell tower to the skyline of the town up until 1950. Due to issues related to the structures alleged instability, the tower was demolished and the church was desecrated. The Sanctuary of the Madonna di S. Marco (Madonna of S. Mark), built in 1939, houses one wooden statue created in 1531 representing the Madonna with Child on throne. The ancient Arc of Entrance to the old town is now being included in the breathtaking system of the \\"Peschiera Park\\". Also, in Via Trieste (Trieste street) there is an important historical building that shows the Landi family symbol. It's among the most important noble constructions in the whole valley of river Taro. Of value are the natural resources and landscapes. North of the town, the Mountain Pelpi reaches , on top of which there is a huge cross. It is a pilgrimage site after a miracle of the Virgin Mary occurred over a century ago. In the center of the village a river runs (Pelpirana) which converges a few miles after into the Taro River. A few kilometers west, the tallest mountain (Monte Penna) reaches about . It is also a pilgrimage place and a suggestive rocky peak surrounded by green forests. However the province lies between above sea level. During recent years, many sporting structures have been built (swimming pool, camping, tennis fields, etc.).  Economy  Tourism is important to the local economy. The area is dependent on summer tourists drawn by the natural environment of the surrounding countryside. Amenities which support the local tourist economy include modern sports complexes (swimming-pools, tennis courts, volleyball and basketball courts, skating and football) and an equipped camping complex, which is situated on one of the hills in the area. The swimming pool is a major tourist attraction in the town. Also available are mushroom picking opportunities which includes the world famous Porcino Valtarese.

She is a principal dancer with The Royal Ballet, London. Early life N√∫√±ez was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She has three brothers, all older than she is. Her mother sent her to ballet classes when she was three. At first, she took dance classes at her teacher's garage. At age five, N√∫√±ez decided to focus on ballet. She entered Teatro Col√≥n Ballet School at age six. Career At age 14, halfway through her training, Colon Theater Ballet's lead Maximiliano Guerra chose N√∫√±ez to dance with her, and the company selected N√∫√±ez to join the company. She danced with the company in both Buenos Aires and on tour, and danced with the company's lead in various roles. In 1997, at age 15, she auditioned for The Royal Ballet when the company was on tour in Los Angeles, even though she didn't speak English. She was offered a contract, but due to the UK labour law, it would be illegal for her to work in London until the age of 16. Therefore, she attended The Royal Ballet School instead, and was guaranteed she would be offered a contract the following year. She was promoted to First Soloist, the second highest rank of the company, in 2000. In 2001, N√∫√±ez replaced an injured Leanne Benjamin as Kitri in Don Quixote, with Carlos Acosta as Basilio. She was promoted to the principal dancer the following year. She has danced leading roles roles in both classical and contemporary works, by choreographers including Frederick Ashton, John Cranko, Kenneth MacMillan, Wayne McGregor and Christopher Wheeldon. In 2013, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance for Viscera, Aeternum and ‚ÄòDiana and Actaeon‚Äô from Metamorphosis: Titian 2012. In 2018, following a performance of Giselle, N√∫√±ez celebrated her 20th anniversary at the Royal Ballet. Artistic director Kevin O'Hare declared her \\"one of the greats of her generation\\". Present were Lady Sarah Chatto, Peter Wright, Monica Mason, and The Argentine ambassador to the UK Renato Carlos Sersale di Cerisano.

They can start and stop very abruptly and last any amount of time from a few seconds to a few minutes. Canine epilepsy is often genetic but epilepsy in cats and other pets is rarer, likely because there is no hereditary component to epilepsy in these animals.  Characteristics  Epilepsy is most commonly recognised by involuntary movements of the head and limbs, however other characteristics include salivation, lack of bodily functions and anxiety. Animals often lose consciousness and are not aware of their surroundings.  Handling seizures  Watching an animal have a seizure can be quite frightening. There is not much that can be done during a seizure except to remain calm and not leave the animal alone. If your pet is having a seizure it is important to make sure they are lying down on the floor away from any water, stairs or other animals. When an animal has a seizure, do not try to grab their tongue or clear their mouth as there is a high chance you will be bitten; contrary to popular myth, neither humans nor animals can \\"swallow their tongue\\" during a seizure, so it is safest to stay well away from their mouth during one. Timing seizures is also crucial. Take notes of seizures - what time they occur, how often and any other specific information which can be passed onto the vet or emergency animal clinic.  Dogs  A bottle of veterinary pharmaceutical potassium bromide oral solution used in dogs, primarily as an antiepileptic (to stop seizures). In dogs, epilepsy is often an inherited condition. The incidence of epilepsy/seizures in the general dog population is estimated to be between 0.5% and 5.7%.K9web.com, Wiersma- Aylward, A. 1995. Canine Epilepsy. Retrieved August 6, 2007 In certain breeds, such as the Belgian Shepherd, the incidence may be much higher. = Diagnosis = There are three types of epilepsy in dogs: reactive, secondary, and primary.Peterson, M., \\"Inherited epilepsy can be devastating in dogs\\". essfta.org Reactive epileptic seizures are caused by metabolic issues, such as low blood sugar or kidney or liver failure. Epilepsy attributed to brain tumor, stroke or other trauma is known as secondary or symptomatic epilepsy. There is no known cause for primary or idiopathic epilepsy, which is only diagnosed by eliminating other possible causes for the seizures. Dogs with idiopathic epilepsy experience their first seizure between the ages of one and three. However, the age at diagnosis is only one factor in diagnosing canine epilepsy, as one study found cause for seizures in one-third of dogs between the ages of one and three, indicating secondary or reactive rather than primary epilepsy. A veterinarian's initial work-up for a dog presenting with a history of seizures may include a physical and neurological exam, a complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis, bile tests, and thyroid function tests.The Canine Epilepsy Network, canine-epilepsy.net These tests verify seizures and may determine cause for reactive or secondary epilepsy. Veterinarians may also request that dog owners keep a \\"seizure log\\" documenting the timing, length, severity, and recovery of each seizure, as well as dietary or environmental changes. = Treatment = Many antiepileptic drugs are used for the management of canine epilepsy. Oral phenobarbital, in particular, levetiracetam and imepitoin are considered to be the most effective antiepileptic drugs and usually used as ‚Äòfirst line‚Äô treatment. Other anti-epileptics such as zonisamide, primidone, gabapentin, pregabalin, sodium valproate, felbamate and topiramate may also be effective and used in various combinations. A crucial part of the treatment of pets with epilepsy is owner education to ensure compliance and successful management.De Risio, L and Platt, S. 2014. Canine and feline epilepsy: diagnosis and management. CAB International: Wallingford, UK. .  Cats  Seizures in cats have various initiating factors. Cats can have reactive, primary (idiopathic) or secondary seizures. Idiopathic seizures are not as common in cats as in dogs however a recent study conducted showed that of 91 feline seizures, 25% were suspected to have had idiopathic epilepsy. In the same group of 91 cats, 50% were secondary seizures and 20% reactive. = Classifications = Idiopathic epilepsy does not have a classification due to the fact there are no known causes of these seizures, however both reactive and symptomatic secondary epilepsy can be placed into classifications. Cancer Meningiomas, lymphomas and glial cell brain tumours are the most common cancers in cats and are all common causes of seizures.  Vascular disease  Vascular disease refers to any condition that effects the flow of blood to the brain and can potentially result in seizure disorders. Common vascular diseases in cats include, feline ischemic encephalopathy, polycythemia and hypertension.  Inflammatory/infectious  Any inflammatory or infectious disease that reaches the brain can result in inducing seizures. The most common inflammatory or infectious diseases which cause seizures in cats include, feline infectious peritonitis, Toxoplasmosis and Cryptococcus.  Reactive seizure disorders  Many diseases that occur as a result from illness in parts of the body other than the brain can cause felines to have seizures, especially in older cats. Some of the common metabolic causes of seizures in felines include, hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, hypoglycaemia and hypothyroidism.

He is generally agreed to be the author of the 1804 novel Nachtwachen (Nightwatches) under the pseudonym Bonaventura. Life As a young boy, Klingemann developed an interest in the theatre which would last his whole life. After he completed his education at the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig, he went to Jena in 1798 to study law and philosophy. There he heard lectures by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling and August Wilhelm Schlegel and became friends with Clemens Brentano. However, in 1801 he left Jena and returned to Braunschweig, where he became editor of Zeitung f√ºr die elegante Welt (Newspaper for the Elegant World). In 1810 Klingemann married Elise Anschuetz, an actress. In 1818 he became the director of the Braunschweiger Theatre. Under Klingemann the Braunschweiger theatre soon acquired a good reputation. It was here that the first performance of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe‚Äôs Faust (Part 1) was staged, on 19 January 1829. In the same year Klingemann accepted a professorship at his old school, the Collegium Carolinum but only one year later he was once again the director at the theatre. In 1831 Ernst August Friedrich Klingemann died. He is buried in the Magni cemetery in Braunschweig. Controversy of Nachtwachen Authorship The authorship of Nachtwachen was disputed for a long time. It has been attributed to, among others, Clemens Brentano, Friedrich Schlegel, Caroline Schelling and Karl Friedrich Gottlob Wetzel. Jean Paul was of the opinion that Friedrich Schelling was the author, having noticed some similarities with his Gianozzo. Scholars today, however, are in general agreement that Bonaventura was Klingemann. The crucial evidence is a handwritten list by Klingemann found among other papers in the university library of Amsterdam by Ruth Haag.Ruth Haag: \\"Noch einmal. Der Verfasser der 'Nachtwachen von Bonaventura'\\". 1804. In: Euphorion. Bd. 81 (1987).

Playing career Senda started his career as an apprentice with Southampton. He joined Wycombe Wanderers as a striker during the 1998‚Äì99 season, and made his Wycombe debut as a substitute during the home game with Oldham Athletic in March 1999, although he had to wait until January 2000 for his full debut. He scored his first goal at first team level during the 3‚Äì1 victory at Wrexham the following month. He was subsequently converted to a right wing back role by Lawrie Sanchez and became a first team regular. The arrival of Tony Adams as Wycombe boss in November 2003 saw the player eventually preferred in a right midfield position and impressed enough to be awarded a new two-year contract in April 2004. With the arrival of John Gorman in November 2004, Senda was employed as a right full back and enjoyed much success working on the right flank with Winger, Kevin Betsy. Senda was then out of contract with Wycombe Wanderers and had been due to sign for Luton Town but that deal failed to materialise. Senda publicly criticised his agent claiming his agent wanted 'too much' from the deal. Senda subsequently sacked his agent. He also had trials with Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers before finally completing a deadline-day deal with Millwall on 31 August 2006. Senda was injured in the final game of the season on 3 May 2008 against Swindon at The County Ground, a game in which he also scored his only goal for the club.

It is in the parish of Hilmarton and the closest major town is Swindon, some to the northeast. The hamlet of New Zealand is nearby, to the northwest. History The first recorded reference to \\"Godacre\\" occurs in 1242. The name occurs in 1348 as Gatacre and in 1408 as Gotagre, and is derived from the Old English word gat-aecre meaning, literally, goat-acre. The land was generally part of the Hilmarton estate, and was acquired by the Poynder family, owners at Hilmarton, in the mid 19th century. The Poynders built or rebuilt several buildings, including the farmhouse (in the centre of the village) and Corton House (to the west). The village has no Church of England presence, the nearest church being St Laurence at Hilmarton, one mile to the south. Quakers were active from the 17th century, and had a burial ground to the east of the village from 1678. A small Primitive Methodist chapel was erected on the site of the burial ground in 1876, and replaced in 1909 by a larger red brick building by the main road, at the turning for New Zealand; this remained in use until 1994 and is now a private house. An independent, later Congregational, chapel was built in the village c. 1824 and closed in 1917. Amenities Goatacre has a cricket club, founded in 1928; their team won the Cricketer National Village Knockout competition in 1988 and 1990, and in 2017 won promotion to the Premier One division of the West of England Premier League, the region's top tier of recreational cricket.

The village is on the A3102 road between Calne and Wootton Bassett. The part of Lyneham village close to the parish church is known as Church End. The civil parish includes the village of Bradenstoke and the hamlets of Preston and The Banks. History In 1086, Domesday Book recorded 42 households at Stoche in the northwest of the modern parish. Earthworks in this area known as Clack Mount, including a mound 20 metres in diameter, could be from a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, although the early history is uncertain. Bradenstoke Priory was founded nearby in 1142, possibly on the site of an earlier chapel. The hamlet on both sides of the road leading to the priory was called Clack from the 14th century, as shown on Andrews' and Dury's map of 1773; in the 20th century the name Bradenstoke was applied to the whole of this area. Lyneham, about a mile east of Bradenstoke, was first mentioned in 1224. In the east of the parish there was a medieval settlement at Littlecott, on the border with Hilmarton; by 1773 this had shrunk to two farms. Preston hamlet, about a mile southeast of Lyneham, has two farmhouses from the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1940, much farmland became an RAF station, extending close to the western edge of Lyneham village. A National School was built opposite St Michael's church in 1861, replacing an earlier school; average attendance in 1902 was 103. A new primary school was built on adjoining land in 1953, and an infants' school nearby in 1965. The Victorian building continued in use for a while but by 2017 housed commercial offices. In 2018, Wiltshire Council proposed to enlarge Lyneham Primary School to have 630 places, to cater for Army relocations to MoD Lyneham and the leasing of surplus service family houses. The parish boundary in the northeast ran along the lane through Tockenham village, thus the manorial estates known as West Tockenham were within Lyneham parish. Around 1969 the boundary was redrawn closer to Lyneham, uniting Tockenham Court Farm with the rest of Tockenham.  Churches  Church of St Michael A church at Lyneham is first mentioned in 1182, belonging to Bradenstoke Priory. The present Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels dates from the 14th century. Restoration by William Butterfield in 1862‚Äì5 included the rebuilding of the chancel and the re-roofing of the nave. In the 14th- century tower are six bells: one dated c.1450 and two from the 17th century. Stained glass in the east window is by Alexander Gibbs. A 1990 window in the south aisle by Henry Haig commemorates the 50th anniversary of RAF Lyneham. As the settlement at Clack was distant from the parish church, a church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin was built there in 1866. In the same year an ecclesiastical parish called Bradenstoke-cum-Clack was created for it, from parts of the parishes of Lyneham and Christian Malford. In 1924 the chapelry of Bradenstoke-cum-Clack, the vicarage of Lyneham, and the rectory of Tockenham were united to form one benefice, although the parishes remained separate. In 1954, Tockenham became a separate parish and the parish of Lyneham with Bradenstoke was created. A Methodist church was built in 1934 at The Green, Lyneham. RAF Lyneham The former RAF Lyneham station, now MoD Lyneham, is adjacent to Lyneham village, to the south and east. The RAF's C-130 Hercules fleet was based here until June 2011 and C-17 Globemasters from RAF Brize Norton made frequent visits. In 2012 all operations were transferred to Brize Norton in west Oxfordshire, to the north. The site is now home to the Defence Technical Training College, which became operational in September 2015. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council called Lyneham and Bradenstoke Parish Council. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. An electoral ward of the same name exists. The ward stretches south east from the Lyneham area to incorporate the Clyffe Pypard parish. The total ward population taken from the 2011 census was 5,460.

History The NCA was set up in 1984 in the wake of the Costigan Commission, which investigated tax evasion and organised crime. It was intended to lead a national law enforcement response to organised crime which could overcome the jurisdictional barriers of the Australian federal system. It had extraordinary powers which removed many of the barriers which prevented other enforcement organisations from being able to comprehensively investigate or prosecute.The National Crime Authority and the Investigation of Fraud Livermore, Gary, 1992. (\\"Originally published:Complex Commercial Fraud: Proceedings of a Conference held 20-23 August 1991 / edited byPeter N GraboskyCanberra : Australian Institute of Criminology, 1992. (AIC Conference Proceedings; No. 10); pp 121-131\\".) The NCA was frequently criticised both for misuse of these powers and lack of effectiveness. Some argue that perception was often due to the covert operations and extreme secrecy required as a direct result of the level of criminals being targeted, and the risk to the operatives and their families. The staff and operatives of the NCA were often reminded by the Chairman that \\"we are dealing with the most evil, calculating and manipulative people who have significant financial resources and good reason to stop us in our work or harm us as individuals\\". The role of the NCA was essentially to gather the intelligence surrounding a specific matter and then hand the matter across to either AFP, ATO or Customs, along with the assistance of the relevant State Police force to effect a strike on the known targets. For the reasons stated, the NCA operatives were never known or seen to the general public, and the credit for the success of the operation went to those in the public light of the media releases, generally the AFP or Customs. Businessman and former Liberal Party President John Elliott accused the NCA of running a vendetta against him inspired by the then Labor government. On 1 January 2003, the NCA, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments (OSCA) were superseded by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC).  Murder of Geoffrey Bowen  There was a targeted killing of NCA Senior Investigator Det Sgt Geoffrey Bowen occurred on 2 March 1994 at the Adelaide office, on Waymouth Street. Bowen was killed by opening a specifically and personally addressed parcel bomb, with a force so severe that it blew out the window of the building on the 12th floor. Bowen was the senior investigator on Operation Cerberus, an investigation into Italian organised crime in Australia. An NCA staff member also lost an eye and suffered severe burns to 40% of his body as a result of the incident. On 1 March 2018, 61-year-old Domenic Perre was charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack after a -year investigation involving state-of-the-art DNA techniques that failed to link Perre to the crime. he had still not entered a plea. He pleaded not guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on 17 February 2020 but his lawyer conceded that there is a case to answer and he was committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of South Australia.

At the end of the war, a transport vacuum arose when the Ministry of Shipping withdrew the wartime service between St Mary's and Penzance.\\"RMS Scillonian III - Take a look above and below decks on the islands' beloved steamer\\" in The Islander - Life on the Isles of Scilly (Spring 2009), pp. 30-34 On 26 March 1920 the current Isles of Scilly Steamship Company was founded with ¬£20,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) raised by selling shares, mostly in the Isles of Scilly. The company was formed with the express purpose of securing a regular shipping service between the islands and the mainland. It came into service when the company received its Certificate of Incorporation, giving the right to commence business, dated 27 March 1920.\\"Scillonian III Back in Service after ¬£1,700,000 Refit\\" in Scilly up to Date, issue 120 (April 1999) , accessed 2011-08-16 Initially services were operated by the Peninnis (ex-HMS Argus), which the company purchased from the Admiralty Disposals for ¬£8,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Ships Monthly gives an acquisition price of ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in )Ships Monthly, Volume 10, 1975 Following the necessary alterations at a cost of ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) this former fishery protection vessel served as the company's ship from 1920 until 1927 but it soon became clear that a purpose-built, new steamer was required. During 1924 the directors of the Steamship Company began considering the purchase of a larger ship and at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 16 June 1925, the directors were empowered to place the order with Ailsa Shipbuilding Company Ltd of Troon, Scotland. In order to keep their yard open during the economic slump, this work was undertaken at cost, the contract price was ¬£24,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The new ferry, built to carry 400 passengers and cargo, was launched on 17 November 1925 and named Scillonian by Mrs. A.A. Dorrien-Smith of Tresco Abbey. At 11 pm on 25 January 1926 she completed her maiden voyage from Troon and docked at St Mary's. She made her first time-tabled, commercial trip from on Thursday 2 February 1926 from St. Mary's to Penzance. It took her three and a quarter hours. Scillonian was grounded in the St Marys, Annet area on 10 September 1951 but refloated the next day, and kept in service until 1956. Following this ship Scillonian II entered into service in 1956, purpose built for the Steamship Company by John I. Thornycroft & Company of Woolston, Southampton at a cost of ¬£250,000, and was in service until 1977. A second ship operated for a while named Queen of the Isles. At approx 500 tons she was smaller than Scillonian II and was used to augment the larger ship at busy times. She was also used to run charter services to the Islands from other ports. On her sale she went to operate an inter-island service in the Pacific. The present Scillonian III was also purpose built for the Steamship Company and entered into service in May 1977. Scillonian III is the third passenger ship of this name and currently in service for passengers and cargo 8 months of the year. Due to the number of tidal currents which meet off Lands End, and the need for a shallow draught to allow access to the Islands, the sea journey to Scilly can be rough. For this reason Scillonian III was fitted with a \\"Flume\\" antiroll stabilizer system. In early 2007, press reports indicated that Cornwall County Council was expected to approved plans for the construction of a new roll-on/roll-off replacement ferry at a cost of ¬£17.5 million. This vessel would be leased to the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company and would replace both Scillonian III and Gry Maritha. This plan (named in its late stages as Option A) was halted because of local opposition to both the built elements of the scheme and the vessel design. A pressure group called upon the then Transport undersecretary, Norman Baker to halt the scheme. On 1 September 2009, the Steamship Company took over the lease to operate and manage Penzance Dry Dock. Established in 1834, it is one of the UK‚Äôs longest established dry docks and provides facilities for vessels requiring repair and conversion. It takes in 15 to 20 ships a year. At the AGM in September 2010, the following corporate figures were published: During the previous fiscal year, Steamship Company craft had carried 73,000 passengers to Scilly by air and sea. This accounted for 61.4% of the total passenger market on the route between Scilly and the mainland. Skybus Ltd had a market share to 50.2% of all passengers flying to St Mary's. In May 2011, the Steamship Company acquired Nike Engineering of the Porthmellon Industrial Estate on St Mary's, which provides marine and mechanical engineering services to the Isles of Scilly.Steamship acquisition, 26 May 2011 In February 2015, the Steamship Company acquired Island Carriers (also of the Porthmellon Industrial Estate) which provides haulage and courier services on the island.Steamship Co. Isles of Steamship Group purchases Island Carriers In May 2016, the Steamship Company acquired the Mali Rose, a Norwegian freight ship that was expected to replace the smaller and older Gry Maritha in the autumn of that year. The vessel was found to be unsuitable and made her final voyage from St Mary's to Penzance on 9 May 2019. The Gry Maritha returned to regular service the following week. =Sole transport operator= Since British International Helicopters ceased its service from Penzance in 2012, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company has been the sole transport operator to the Isles of Scilly. In February 2017 a new Penzance Heliport was unanimously granted planning permission by the Cornwall Council to reinstate a helicopter service from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly. In May of the same year, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company began proceedings for a Judicial Review of the planning decision. These Judicial Review proceedings began after an anonymous appeal to the Secretary of State to review the planning permission failed a month earlier. The actions of the Steamship Company were widely condemned by businesses, residents, and visitors to Penzance and the Isles of Scilly. The judicial review was opposed by a petition started by an Isles of Scilly resident, which accumulated over 10,000 signatures in just a few days. Penzance Heliport withdrew and resubmitted an amended planning application in January 2018, and is now aiming to begin operations from spring 2020. Following the objection to the Penzance Heliport plans, in February 2018 the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company announced its own helicopter service operating from Land's End, to begin in May 2018. This announcement met widespread condemnation from those aware of the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company's actions. On 21 May 2018, the steamship company inaugurated its new service from Land's End Airport to St Mary‚Äôs with a 10-seater AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter. In October 2018 the company announced its Island Helicopters service would be taking a \\"winter break\\" but in February 2019 it was announced the service was being withdrawn completely.

Services Scillonian III operates a return service from March to November (Monday to Saturday, and some Sundays during July/August). She departs Penzance at 9.15am and returns from St. Mary's at 16.30pm, although these times may differ on certain dates due to tidal conditions, school holidays, and other events. The sailing time is approximately 2 hours 45 minutes. During the winter, when Scillonian III is out of service, a cargo service is provided by the Gry Maritha.

It was named for Louis Eholt, the man who provided the land for the village. The town of Eholt was founded in 1898 and served as a CPR headquarters for the hauling of copper mined in nearby Phoenix. At its peak Eholt had a population of 300 and boasted five hotels, three restaurants, a livery, a butcher shop, a drug store, a clothing and dry goods store, a blacksmith shop and other amenities. Eholt's initial prosperity did not last long, however. A CPR strike in 1908 was enough to drive many of the townsfolk away. The town clung for survival until 1912 when a fire broke out. Later that year, most of the CPR facilities were moved to Grand Forks. Eholt died in 1949 with the closing of its post office. By this time the population had dwindled to 17. Today, all that remains of Eholt is a cement pillar, the foundations of the station and section house, and a commemorative sign in the midst of farm land. The foundation of the third water tower still stands about 700 metres to the east of the station foundation. The former CPR right-of-way is now the Trans Canada Trail/Spirit of 2010 Trail, and may be enjoyed by hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders and cross-country skiers in winter months.

Population Literature Combray was the writer Marcel Proust's name for the village of Illiers (near the Cathedral town of Chartres), vividly depicted by him in the opening chapters of his vast semi-autobiographical novel In Search of Lost Time. The home of Proust's \\"Aunt L√©onie\\" in the heart of the village, where he spent much of his childhood, has been transformed into a museum to the writer's memory. It provides visitors with a delightful view of 19th-century provincial life as well as of the many Proustian mementos on display. It should be added that Proust scholars have recently claimed his descriptions of \\"Combray\\" owe as much to the author's stays in his uncle's home in Auteuil, near Paris, as to Illiers-Combray. As a tribute to Proust's literary masterpiece, the people of Illiers decided, in 1971, to change the town's name to Illiers-Combray, on the occasion of the first centenary of the author's birth. Twinning The village is twinned with Coniston, Cumbria, the home of John Ruskin. Ruskin's work was a source of inspiration to Proust.

Early in World War I he was asked to produce tractors for moving heavy howitzers, the result being eventually the first tanks. Early life Tritton was born in Islington, where his father William Birch Tritton (1845, Hythe, Kent ‚Äì 29 July 1918) and mother Ellen Hannah Ashbee (16 December 1847 ‚Äì 19 April 1921) lived at 51 Carleton Road. His parents had married on 22 October 1873 in Boughton under Blean, Kent. His brother was Percy Kingsnorth Tritton (1878‚Äì1903). He was the son of a London stockbroker, educated at Christ's College, Finchley and King's College London. By 1901 he was living in Altrincham. A Fosters' 1917 Mark IV tank at the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in January 2007, which saw action at the Battle of Cambrai (1917) Career He joined Gwynnes Pumps in 1891. He later became a linotype mechanic and an electrical engineer. In 1906 he joined William Foster & Co. on Waterloo Street in Lincoln, and from 1911 until 1939 he was chairman of the company, after which he became managing director. On 22 July 1915, it was decided on the proposal for the tank ‚Äì 28 tons, to cross a trench four feet wide. The tank was developed at Foster's Wellington Works on Firth Road and tested on a field south of the Lincoln Avoiding Line, a railway line that closed in 1985. The site of Foster's was demolished in 1984. He was the production engineer for the tank at Fosters. He had the idea for steering the tank with the rear wheels. Major Ernest Swinton and Major Walter Dally Jones thought up the name tank. fr. Kenneth Spencer - Personal conversation with John (k/a Jack) Knott My grandfather John (k/a Jack) Knott, worked in the factory in World War I. He always said to us that , in order to maintain a degree of secrecy in the work, the factory workers were told that they were building \\"water carriers for Mesopotamia\\". That, according to my grandfather, was how and why the term \\"tank\\" came to be used. Of course that does not necessarily conflict with the previous statement re. Ernest Swinton, but it may explain it. The construction of the first tank at Fosters began on 11 August 1915. World War I tanks were also built by Metro-Cammell of Wednesbury and a number of other contractors. Foster's was, at the time, the only company in the UK that were commercially making caterpillar-tracked vehicles. Personal life In 1916 he married Isobella Johnstone White, of Scotland, in Willesden. He was knighted on 21 February 1917. He was a JP in Kesteven from 1934. He died in Lincoln aged 71 in September 1946. His wife died in Lincoln on 15 November 1950. He had lived on Eastcliff Road in Lincoln. Tritton Road in Lincoln is named after him and a blue plaque is located at the entrance of a supermarket at the northern end of the road around the site of the original factories.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from through , most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1969 to 1971 and, won the World Series in 1970. He also played for the Chicago Cubs (1972) and New York Yankees (1976-1977). In 2001, he was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame. Biography A native of Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands, Hendricks was selected by the Baltimore Orioles from the California Angels in the Rule 5 draft on November 28, 1967.Folkemer, Paul. \\"The Best Rule 5 Draft Picks in Baltimore Orioles History,\\" PressBox Baltimore, December 2014. He was a superior defensive catcher and a very fine handler of pitchers on a usually strong Orioles rotation that included Mike Cuellar, Pat Dobson, Dave McNally, Jim Palmer and Tom Phoebus. He also spent most of his playing for the Orioles on teams that went to three consecutive World Series from 1969-71, sharing duties with Andy Etchebarren. Hendricks led American League catchers in fielding percentage in 1969 and 1975.Baseball Digest, July 2001, P.86, Vol. 60, No. 7, Hendricks also played briefly for the Chicago Cubs and New York Yankees. Playing for the Cubs on September 16, 1972 against the New York Mets at Wrigley Field, Hendricks received five bases on balls, equaling the league mark at that moment. His most productive season came in 1970, when he hit 12 home runs with 41 RBI. Hendricks went 4-for-11 (.364), hit a solo home run in Game 1, decided Game 2 with a two run opposite field double and had a total of four RBI to help Baltimore defeat the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970 World Series. He also appeared in the 1976 World Series for the Yankees against Cincinnati, made the Orioles bullpen coach following the 1977 season, and was a player-coach in 1978 & 1979. He was involved in the most controversial play of the 1970 World Series when the Cincinnati Reds were batting against the Orioles with one out and the score tied at three in the sixth inning of Game 1. With runners Tommy Helms at first base and Bernie Carbo at third, pinch hitter Ty Cline hit a Baltimore chop off Jim Palmer who, while running towards home plate, immediately signaled to Hendricks that Carbo was trying to score from third. Hendricks fielded the ball barehanded, spun around to his left and lunged at an oncoming Carbo in an attempt to tag him out, but collided with umpire Ken Burkhart who, while positioning himself to judge whether the batted ball was fair, accidentally blocked the runner's path to the plate. Carbo slid around Burkhart on the outside but missed touching home plate. With his back to the play and after being knocked down, Burkhart ruled Carbo out even though Hendricks made the tag with his mitt while holding the ball in his bare hand.Durso, Joseph. \\"Umpire Disputed,\\" The New York Times, Sunday, October 11, 1970. Retrieved April 24, 2020 Having not been properly tagged out, Carbo unknowingly stepped on the plate as he was arguing, but the play was dead once Burkhart made his call. One inning earlier in the fifth, Hendricks had tied the match with a solo home run. He also played a part in a memorable play from the previous year's World Series. With the Mets leading 3-0 and two Orioles on base with two outs in the fourth inning of Game 3, Hendricks cracked a hard- hit line drive into the left-center field gap that most thought would go for extra bases, scoring two runs and putting the Orioles back in the game. But center fielder Tommie Agee, who was playing the left-handed Hendricks to pull in right-center, chased down the ball on a dead sprint, extending his left arm for a memorable backhanded over-the-shoulder catch in the webbing of his glove. Hendricks made the only pitching appearance in his MLB playing career in a one-sided 24-10 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium on June 26, 1978. He was the second consecutive position player used as a relief pitcher after Larry Harlow when he entered the game with two outs and the Orioles losing 24-6 in the fifth inning. He allowed only a hit and a walk over 2 scoreless innings.\\"Blue Jays Rout Orioles By 24-10,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Monday, June 26, 1978. Retrieved April 24, 2020 In 711 games played, including 658 with Baltimore, Hendricks was a .220 hitter with 62 home runs (still the all-time record for a United States Virgin Islands native) and 230 RBI. In nine postseason games, he had .273, 2 HR, 10 RBI. In 602 games as a catcher, Hendricks collected 2783 outs, 228 assists, 31 double plays, and committed just only 29 errors for a significant .990 fielding percentage. Hendricks was a big star in Puerto Rico. He played for 17 seasons with the Cangrejeros de Santurce and occupies third place on the all-time list in homers with 105. =Coaching career= Hendricks became a fixture in Baltimore by holding the position as bullpen coach for 28 years, the longest coaching tenure in Orioles history. His contract was not renewed for that position as of October 2005, in part because he had a mild stroke in April. The 2005 season marked the 37th that Hendricks served in a Baltimore uniform as a player or coach, another club record. He also had the longest active coaching streak with one club among all major league coaches. After his stroke, Hendricks was reassigned to another position within the organization, one that would enable the club to take advantage of his huge popularity within the Baltimore community; along with his loyalty to the \\"Orioles way\\" and to the traditions of baseball, he was a tireless signer of pre-game autographs and a general good-will ambassador. He was slated to be the host for the 2006 Baltimore Baseball Cruise aboard The Golden Princess. =Death= Elrod Hendricks died of a heart attack in Glen Burnie, Maryland, one day shy of his 65th birthday. The Orioles wore the number 44 on the sleeves of their jerseys in 2006, to honor Hendricks. Although the number has not been officially retired, no Oriole player has worn it since Hendricks died. In 2007, St. Frances Academy, Baltimore, MD started an annual baseball tournament in his name.

It was presented by models Jamie Atiko and Darren Malcolm. The non-studio segments of the show were also shown in the United States between 2003 and 2004 on the digital cable channel Nickelodeon GAS as part of a Saturday night gaming block, under the show title Play 2Z. In this version, some segments were redubbed with an American voice. History =Conception= The first series was commissioned by Sky One, in the summer of 2003. The channel had been looking for a new videogaming series since the disappointment that was Blam!, an advertorial show for Gameplay.com, that aired in 2000. The production company that was selected was Shine Limited, which was set up by former BSkyB executive Elisabeth Murdoch after she quit as broadcaster. As part of the unofficial terms of her severance package, Shine was promised several hundred hours of commissioned programming. Jezz Wright, who was then editor of the Lifestyle & Features department at Shine was tasked with coming up with a format that would produce multiple hours of output per week. The budget was challenging so it had to be a simple format whereby, to keep costs down, two or three could be recorded in a day. This would ensure the programme maintained a considerable profit margin from the production budget. It is for this reason that Gamezville ended up being an hour-long show , five times a week. Jezz Wright, who came from a TV news background conceived Gamezville as a zoo type format whereby the production team would play as much a part on camera as they would off it. A 'newsroom' environment would be created that would serve as the off air production office and the on screen newsroom. Every day, the show would have a mix of reviews, news, features and characters, all encased in a heavily graffitied studio presented by real gamers in a rough 'n ready sense rather than the traditionally contrived 'kids TV' type presenting. The show suffered from being a daily 60-minute production. With only a finite amount of news and reviews to cover each week, items and features were sometimes stretched and games that never really should have been featured that prominently had significant airtime. Although the strategy may have not pleased all videogaming fans who watched the show, the approach taken by the production meant that apart from keeping costs low the series showcased new talent and originated some innovative strands. =Cellcast complaint= \\"The Guru\\" segment of the show was previously titled \\"The Gamez Guru\\" in the first series. But due to a complaint from Cellcast who claimed it infringed on the copyright of their own long running gaming cheat TV show Game Guru, when the first series re-aired on Sky One in the early mornings, all \\"Guru\\" graphic sequences were replaced with the second series to keep in line with the new character. Even though mentions of it remain during the live-action sequences. Format The show was filmed in a large set, with audience members on set and near the presenters in a manner similar to Top Gear. Jamie and Darren would introduce the various segments of the show, which would then be presented by another presenter. Though shot in what looked like a studio, it was actually a TV studio sound stage setup. To avoid the costs of the former (especially the hire costs of a three camera setup, complete with broadcast cameramen and a vision mixer), the show was filmed with two cameras. A Sony DSR-500 as the primary, and the cheaper Sony PD-150 for cutaways. This made most of the studio segments (which represented over 80% of the show) very simple and cheap to cut together in post-production. All of the on-screen G-Team were actually the show's production team. Show segments =Face Off= The show would start with the first part of the Face Off segment, where a multiplayer game is used to settle a dispute between two members of the public, or, in the second series, celebrities. This takes the form of a best of three match between the two guests, the winner of which then plays against one of the hosts. Each of these four matches would be in a different quarter of the show. When a player won by all the matches it was referred to as a White Wash. =\\"The Guru\\"= This portion of the show featured The Guru ‚Äì supposedly filmed in the roof space above the studio (Series One) and then a disused lift shaft (Series Two). He would reply to requests for cheats or tips sent in by viewers, and was made to look like a mystic or a druid who claimed to have infinite knowledge. He was a comedy character who would often mock the viewers, calling them \\"Maggots\\" before giving out the cheats, and appearing to be constantly exasperated by the 'worthless' questions from viewers and the 'stupidity' of the two main presenters. =Reviews= Members of the audience would be found to be playing a game during the course of the show, and would be interviewed by a presenter to discuss the various good and bad points of the game and give it a rating out of five 'Gs' (first series). In the second series, the game was rated out of 10, though this time by a member of the show, with the audience member just voicing opinions. Reception Reaction to the show was largely negative. The show received criticism for being out of touch with videogamers who were demographically much older on average than the teenagers the show was seemingly trying to appeal to. The fact that the weekly output was so high, combined with both series running for a combined total of 192 episodes, struck many that Sky One was not concerned with the content of the show or the reception it was receiving from viewers. In a Jolt TV review of the series, it was stated, \\"Gamezville is appalling, and does no favours whatsoever to the games industry\\". =Response from video game TV presenters / producers= During an interview with GamesMaster Magazine about his new game show When Games Attack, Dominik Diamond declared that \\"Gamezville is the equivalent to eating your own shit, the producers must have thought 'Oh because we have black people in it must be street.'\\" Johnny Ffinch, producer of GamesMaster, was also asked about his opinion on Gamezville during an interview, and expressed: \\"I have more respect for suicide bombers than I do for the people who are involved with Gamezville... it's all fucking 'Yo mate...' I mean these guys can't even speak fucking English!\\" Comedian Robert Florence would go on to create the internet show Consolevania as a reaction to the programme, which would later become the BBC Scotland show videoGaiden.

It is in the Bolsover district of the county. It is in the civil parish of Blackwell. Named after West House Farm, the settlement was founded in the 1870s.  Railway  The Midland Railway (later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway) was the main employer and landowner. Many roads such as Allport Terrace, Bolden Terrace and Pettifer Terrace were named after Midland Railway directors, and the school was also built and maintained by the company. Most of the houses were two up and two down, with an outside toilet in the back yard, although the engine drivers' houses were bigger. They did not have mains electricity until the 1950s and were owned by the Midland Railway, later by the British Railways Board until about 1969. There should have been 100 houses by the school but only 75 were built, stopping at 2, Bolden Terrace, making it a semi-detached house by accident. The mainline railway through Westhouses is the Erewash Valley line from Nottingham to Chesterfield. A station existed very early in the lines development but was soon closed. The second station became known as Westhouses & Blackwell. Branchlines ran to New Hucknall colliery and New Hucknall Sidings on the Great Central Railway. A through line ran to Tibshelf, Sutton Colliery, Silverhill, Butcherwood and Pleasley Colliery, finally connecting with the Robin Hood line at Mansfield Woodhouse. Built by the Midland Railway the engine shed included arrival and departure roads, an ash road, six internal roads and the legs road, which once had a shear legged crane positioned over it. This was used for the lifting of locomotives. The shed was intended to be a maintenance centre for the LMS but water supply problems prevented its expansion. Railwaymen's children would often be given a turn driving the locos during the 1930s, and in the diesel era rail enthusiasts would also be allowed to drive locomotives up and down the yard. Besides working on the railway in the various grades, many local residents found employment at Blackwell Colliery, but there was little other employment and many were out of work in the 1930s depression. A chapel of ease (the tin tabernacle) was built near the School and Recreation ground, and stood until its removal to the Midland Railway - Butterley near Ripley. The organ was played by a lady who reputedly only knew two hymns, one of which was \\"The day thou gavest\\" and the other was \\"To be a pilgrim.\\" After the 1926 General Strike many villagers boycotted the Trent Bus Company as it had continued running buses during the emergency, and instead they patronised the local village service, which had gone out in sympathy. Westhouses Motive Power Depot in 1983 In the 1950s and 60's Jinty's 4F's, 8F's and 9F's were most common. In steam days Garratts could be seen pounding up the gradient in front of a long line of coal wagons. When diesels were introduced, classes, 08, 25, 47 and 45 were seen. Into the 1970s British Rail Classes 08, 20, 47 and latterly 56 were the main stay. Classes 25, 45, and 58 also visited the shed. Westhouses - Tibshelf Sidings in 1980 The shed closed to locomotives when traffic defects caused a Class 56 to derail and the shed was deemed to be no longer in a usable condition. Operations were moved to Tibshelf sidings until the complete closure of Westhouses as a traincrew depot in January 1987. The last locally employed railway positions were the travelling shunters based in the flat-topped cabin at the start of Tibshelf Sidings, these positions were however made redundant when Silverhill colliery closed. The village still had a railwayman - Mr.H Turner at Toton, a former Westhouses man from 1960-2002. The building was actually condemned by Walter Warwick, born in 2, Bolden Terrace and who started his career as an engineering apprentice in the Shed, Health and Safety Manager for London Midland Region of British Railways, and the younger brother of Dr.Gordon Warwick, the geomorphologist, born in The Willows, Park Lane.

The janapada was divided into two parts by the Vindhyas, the northern part had its capital at Ujjayini and the southern part had its centre at Mahishmati.Mahajan, V.D. (1960, reprint 2007).

According to the Puranic accounts, the Haihayas were the earliest rulers of Avanti, who captured the region from the Nagas. Initially, they ruled from Mahishmati. Some accounts place Ujjayini as the capital of Avanti.Later, the whole janapada was divided into two parts with the capitals at Mahishmati and Ujjayini. The Haihayas were a confederation of five clans, the Vitihotras, the Bhojas, the Avantis, the Tundikeras and the Sharyatas. Later, the Haihayas were better known by their dominant clan - the Vitihotras. Ripunjaya, the last Vitihotra ruler of Ujjayini was overthrown by his amatya (minister) Pulika, who placed his son, Pradyota on the throne.Raizada, Ajit (1992).

Pradyota captured the Vatsa king Udayana but later he married his daughter Vasavadatta to Udayana. The Mahavagga described him as cruel and according to the Majjhima Nikaya, Ajatashatru, the king of Magadha fortified Rajagriha to protect it from an invasion led by Pradyota.

Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.179-81 Pradyota's chief queen Gopalamata (mother of prince Gopala) was a disciple of Buddhist monk Mahakatyayana and constructed a stupa in Ujjayini. Prodyota had two sons, Gopala and Palaka. He was succeeded by Palaka. According to Jaina accounts Palaka ascended to the throne on the day of passing away of Mahavira. According to the Kathasaritsagara and the Avashyaka Kathanaka, the kingdom of Vatsa was already a part of Avanti during the reign of Palaka and a prince of the royal family was the governor of Kaushambi. In the Mricchakatika, Palaka was described as a tyrant who was overthrown by a popular revolt. This revolt placed Aryaka on the throne of Ujjayini. The Puranas place Nadivardhana or Vartivardhana after Aryaka. But these names are probably corruptions of Avantivardhana, the name of the son of Palaka according to the Kathasaritsagara or the son of Gopala according to the Nepali Brihatkatha. He was defeated by Shishunaga, the king of Magadha.Raychaudhuri, H.C. (1972).

Alternatively, the term is often used in a popular context to refer to literature which is written in a non-Celtic language, but originates nonetheless from the Celtic nations or else displays subjects or themes identified as \\"Celtic\\". Examples of these literatures include the medieval Arthurian romances written in the French language, which drew heavily from Celtic sources, or in a modern context literature in the English language by writers of Irish, Welsh, Cornish, Manx, Scottish or Breton extraction. Literature in Scots and Ulster Scots may also be included within the concept. In this broader sense, the applicability of the term \\"Celtic literature\\" can vary as widely as the use of the term \\"Celt\\" itself. For information on the development of particular national literatures, see: Irish literature, Scottish literature, Welsh literature, Cornish literature, Breton literature and Manx literature. Early Celtic literature Gaelic language and literature from Ireland became established in the West of Scotland between the 4th and 6th centuries. Until the development of Scottish Gaelic literature with a distinct identity, there was a literary standard shared between Gaelic- speaking Ireland and Scotland. The Hiberno-Scottish mission from the 6th century spread Christianity and established monasteries and centres of writing. Gaelic literature in Scotland includes a celebration, attributed to the Irish monk Adomn√°n, of the Pictish King Bridei's (671‚Äì93) victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain (685). Pictish, the now extinct Brythonic language spoken in Scotland, has left no record of poetry, but poetry composed in Gaelic for Pictish kings is known. By the 9th century, Gaelic speakers controlled Pictish territory and Gaelic was spoken throughout Scotland and used as a literary language. However, there was great cultural exchange between Scotland and Ireland, with Irish poets composing for Scottish or Pictish patrons, and Scottish poets composing for Irish patrons. The Book of Deer, a 10th-century Latin Gospel Book with early-12th-century additions in Latin, Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic, is noted for containing the earliest surviving Gaelic writing from Scotland. A facsimile page of Y Gododdin c. 1275 In Medieval Welsh literature the period before 1100 is known as the period of Y Cynfeirdd (\\"The earliest poets\\") or Yr Hengerdd (\\"The old poetry\\"). It roughly dates from the birth of the Welsh language until the arrival of the Normans in Wales towards the end of the 11th century. Y Gododdin is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Britonnic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named Catraeth in c. AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin, and survives only in one manuscript, known as the Book of Aneirin. The poem is recorded in a manuscript of the second half of the 13th century, and it has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date would place its oral composition to soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd (\\"Old North\\") in what would have been the Cumbric variety of Brythonic.Elliot (2005), p. 583.Jackson (1969)‚Äîthe work is titled The Gododdin: the oldest Scottish poem. Others consider it the work of a poet in medieval Wales, composed in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th- century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry. The name Mabinogion is a convenient label for a collection eleven prose stories collated from two medieval Welsh manuscripts known as the White book of Rhydderch (Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch) (c. 1350) and the Red Book of Hergest (Llyfr Coch Hergest) (1382‚Äì1410). They are written in Middle Welsh, the common literary language between the end of the eleventh century and the fourteenth century. They include the four tales that form Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi (\\"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi\\"). The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs, and early medieval historical traditions. While some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of these tales is the product of a highly developed medieval Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written. Lady Charlotte Guest in the mid-19th century was the first to publish English translations of the collection, popularising the name \\"Mabinogion\\" at the same time. No Cornish literature survives from the Primitive Cornish period (c. 600‚Äì800 AD). The earliest written record of the Cornish language, dating from the 9th century, is a gloss in a Latin manuscript of the Consolation of Philosophy, which used the words ud rocashaas. The phrase means \\"it (the mind) hated the gloomy places\\".Oxford scholars detect earliest record of Cornish Sims-Williams, P., 'A New Brittonic Gloss on Boethius: ud rocashaas', Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 50 (Winter 2005), 77‚Äì86. Revival literature in non-Celtic languages The Gaelic Revival reintroduced Celtic themes into modern literature. The concept of Celticity encouraged cross-fertilisation between Celtic cultures. There have been modern texts based around Celtic literature. Bernard Cornwell writes about the Arthurian legends in his series The Warlord Chronicles. Other writers of Celtic literature in English include Dylan Thomas and Sian James. Themes from Celtic Literature within Arthurian Romances Within many Arthurian texts one can see the influence of Celtic literature and folklore. Examples of Arthurian legends with these components are Marie de France‚Äôs Lanval, the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and in Perceval De Troyes, The Story of the Grail. In his work ‚ÄúCeltic Elements in ‚ÄòLanvnal ‚Äòand Graelent‚Äô,‚Äù Cross claims that Lanval is a medieval narrative called a ‚ÄúBrenton Lay‚Äù which is a work that contains themes from Celtic tradition.Cross, Tom P. ‚ÄúThe Celtic Elements in the Lays of ‚ÄòLanval‚Äô and ‚ÄòGraelent‚Äô.‚Äù Modern Philology. 10th ed. vol. 12. The University of Chicago Press, 1915, p.5. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2012. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is said to contain traditions from early Irish Lore, such as the Beheading test.Buchanan, Alice. ‚ÄúThe Irish Framework of Gawain and the Green Knight.‚Äù PMLA. 2nd ed. vol. 47. Modern Language Association, 1932. JSTOR. Web. 9 Oct. 2012. In addition to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Lanval, Perceval, The Story of the Grail contains a combination of these two Celtic themes. While there are other tales whose Celtic elements can be examined, these three are most likely among the best examples. A major aspect of Celtic literature within ‚ÄúLanval‚Äù is the theme itself, the story that a fairy mistress falls in love with a mortal. In Lanval, an unpopular knight of the court becomes the lover of a mysterious and otherworldly woman. Though he breaks his promise to keep their love a secret, he is eventually reunited with her (Marie de France 154-167). Cross states that, ‚ÄúThe influence of one medieval romance of Celtic stories involving both the fairy mistress and the Journey to the Otherworld has long since been recognized‚Äù.Cross, Tom P. ‚ÄúThe Celtic Elements in the Lays of ‚ÄòLanval‚Äô and ‚ÄòGraelent‚Äô.‚Äù Modern Philology. 10th ed. vol. 12. The University of Chicago Press, 1915, p.10. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2012. While we are never told whether or not Lanval‚Äôs lover is a fairy, it is most certain that she is a woman of supernatural origin. There is a similar example to the story of ‚ÄúLanval‚Äù in the Irish story, ‚ÄúAidead Muirchertaig maic Erca‚Äù.Cross, Tom P. ‚ÄúThe Celtic Elements in the Lays of ‚ÄòLanval‚Äô and ‚ÄòGraelent‚Äô.‚Äù Modern Philology. 10th ed. vol. 12. The University of Chicago Press, 1915, p.11. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2012. One of the only differences between the original Irish stories and that of ‚ÄúLanval‚Äù is the fact that Marie de France‚Äôs story is more Christianized and erases any overtly Pagan elements. There are also many other examples of a fairy mistress bestowing favor upon a mortal man within Irish folklore. After providing many examples of this theme within early Celtic literature, Cross states that, ‚ÄúThose given (examples) above demonstrate beyond the possibility of doubt that stories of fee who hanker after mortal earth-born lovers and who visit mortal soil in search of their mates existed in early Celtic tradition‚Ä¶‚Äù.Cross, Tom P. ‚ÄúThe Celtic Elements in the Lays of ‚ÄòLanval‚Äô and ‚ÄòGraelent‚Äô.‚Äù Modern Philology. 10th ed. vol. 12. The University of Chicago Press, 1915, p.15. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2012. In ‚ÄúSir Gawain and the Green Knight‚Äù the theme of the Beheading Test is prevalent. According to Alice Buchanan‚Äôs article: ‚ÄúThe Irish Framework of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,‚Äù Buchanan states: ‚Äúthe theme of Beheading texts, which occurs in Arthurian Romances, French, English, and German, from about 1180 ‚Äì 1380, is derived from an Irish tradition actually existent in a MS. Written before 1106‚Äù.Buchanan, Alice. ‚ÄúThe Irish Framework of Gawain and the Green Knight.‚Äù PMLA. 2nd ed. vol. 47. Modern Language Association, 1932, p. 315. JSTOR. Web. 9 Oct. 2012. In ‚ÄúSir Gawain and the Green Knight,‚Äù it‚Äôs Gawain‚Äôs head which is at stake. This is where the ‚ÄúBeheading Game‚Äù comes into place. This is when a supernatural challenger offers to let his head be cut off in exchange for a return blow.France, Marie de. ‚ÄúLanval.‚Äù The Norton Anthology of English Literature. Gen. ed. Stephen Greenblatt. 9th ed. Vol. 1. New York: Norton, 2012, p. 160. Print. In the journal article, ‚ÄúThe Medieval Mind in ‚ÄòSir Gawain and the Green Knight‚Äô author Dean Loganbill states that the first text in which the ‚ÄúBeheading Game‚Äù is shown is in the Middle Irish tale of Bricriu‚Äôs Feast. However, the Gawain poets put a spin on the simple beheading game by linking it with themes of truth. The article also notes that it is also frequently stated that the Gawain poet was the first to unite the beheading game with the themes of temptation.Loganbill, Dean. ‚ÄúThe Medieval Mind in ‚ÄòSir Gawain and the Green Knight‚Äô.‚Äù The Bulletin of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association. 4th ed. vol. 26. Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association, 1972, p. 123. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2012. The Celtic motifs of the ‚ÄúBeheading Game‚Äù and temptation are also apparent in the first continuation of the French romance, Perceval Chretien de Troyes, The Story of the Grail‚ÄîA story by Chretien which is believed to parallel Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in plot (Grant 7). The early French character known as Caradoc is thought to be one of the first Arthurian characters to use the beheading game as a means to figure out whom his birth father is. The theme of temptation falls into place as many characters fall into the trap of seduction by other people and also by wizards and other mythological creatures that are known to be of Celtic origin (Chr√©tien). Celtic mythology also displays itself in ‚ÄúSir Gawain and the Green Knight.‚Äù Looking at Gawain, we see him as the leading leader at the Primary Table in which he is tested by the rulers of the otherworld in terms of his fitness for fame in this world and the next. With this in mind, the ‚Äúrulers of the otherworld‚Äù have a mythical nature to them; there are references to sun gods, and old and new gods. It might seem as though that would be taking the mythological concept and simplifying it, however in Celtic mythology, the traits of individual and groups of gods are not so distinct.Loganbill, Dean. ‚ÄúThe Medieval Mind in ‚ÄòSir Gawain and the Green Knight‚Äô.‚Äù The Bulletin of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association. 4th ed. vol. 26.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom by Alston Rivers Ltd, London, on April 16, 1909.McIlvaine, E., Sherby, L.S. and Heineman, J.H. (1990) P.G. Wodehouse: A comprehensive bibliography and checklist. New York: James H. Heineman, p. 18. Its subtitle is A Tale of the Great Invasion. An adapted and much abbreviated version, set in the United States, appeared in the July and August 1915 issues of Vanity Fair under the title The Military Invasion of America and with the subtitle A Remarkable Tale of the German-Japanese Invasion of 1916. The original story was not published in the United States until 1979, four years after Wodehouse's death, when it was included in the collection The Swoop! and Other Stories.  Plot summary  The Swoop! tells of the simultaneous invasion of England by several armies ‚Äî \\"England was not merely beneath the heel of the invader. It was beneath the heels of nine invaders. There was barely standing-room.\\"Chapter 3 ‚Äî and features references to many well-known figures of the day, among them the politician Herbert Gladstone, novelist Edgar Wallace, actor-managers Seymour Hicks and George Edwardes, and boxer Bob Fitzsimmons. The invaders are the Russians under Grand Duke Vodkakoff, the Germans under Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig ‚Äì the reigning British monarch of the day was Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha ‚Äî the Swiss Navy, the Monegasques, a band of Moroccan brigands under Raisuli, the Young Turks, the Mad Mullah from Somaliland, the Chinese under Prince Ping Pong Pang, and the Bollygollans in war canoes. The initial reaction to the invasion is muted. \\"It was inevitable, in the height of the Silly Season, that such a topic as the simultaneous invasion of Great Britain by nine foreign powers should be seized upon by the press\\", but the English are far more interested in cricket and one newspaper placard announces \\"Surrey Doing Badly\\" (at cricket), ahead of \\"German Army Lands in England\\".Chapter 1 And when the Germans begin shelling London ‚Äî \\"Fortunately it was August, and there was nobody in town.\\"Chapter 6 ‚Äî the destruction of nearly all the capital's statues, the reduction of the Albert Hall to a heap of picturesque ruins, and the burning of the Royal Academy, earn Prince Otto a hearty vote of thanks from the grateful populace.Chapter 7 The European parties form an alliance and expel the other invaders, but the Swiss soon leave, to be home in time for the winter hotel season, and when Prince Otto and Grand Duke Vodkakoff are offered music hall engagements and the leader of the army of Monaco is not, he takes offence and withdraws his troops. The two remaining armies are overcome thanks to the stratagems of the indomitable Clarence Chugwater, leader of the Boy Scouts. By causing each commander to become jealous of the other's music hall fees, he succeeds in breaking up the alliance and, in the ensuing chaos, Clarence and his Boy Scouts are able to overcome the invaders. In The Military Invasion of America, the United States is invaded by armies from Germany, under Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig, and Japan, led by General Owoki. Once again it is Clarence Chugwater who saves the day.  Explanation of the title  The title alludes to The Swoop of the Vulture, a novel by James Blyth that describes a surprise attack by forces of the \\"Imperial German Vulture\\". Complaining about the difficulties caused by so many simultaneous and surprise invasions, the leader of the German forces, Prince Otto, refers explicitly to Blyth's novel: \\"'It all comes of this dashed Swoop of the Vulture business', he grumbled.\\"  Major themes  The Swoop! is a comical satire on the then- popular genre of invasion literature. Six years before The Swoop, Wodehouse (under the pseudonym Henry William-Jones) contributed a humorous article to Punch magazine in which he outlined, in a mock-serious tone, the plot of an \\"Inspired-Prophecy kind of novel, in which England is overrun by invaders until the last few chapters\\". While it differs in many details from the earlier outline, The Swoop was that novel. In writing The Swoop, Wodehouse was responding to an upsurge in the popularity of the invasion genre: 1909 marked \\"the year of greatest suppuration\\" of the genre. William Le Queux's The Invasion of 1910 had been serialised in the Daily Mail and was a best-seller, while Guy du Maurier's play, An Englishman's Home, which had opened at Wyndham's Theatre on January 27, was a theatrical sensation, playing in three London theatres simultaneously. Many writers of invasion-scare stories took as their starting point an assumed unpreparedness on the part of Britain's armed forces to counter the threat of invasion, and they wrote with the aim of raising public awareness of this deficiency. Du Maurier, for example, was a serving army officer, while Le Queux was assisted by Field Marshal Earl Roberts, who had resigned from active duty a few years earlier to devote himself to the National Service League, which promoted universal military training. For these, and similar, writers, Britain's safety depended on building up its armed forces. Du Maurier's play was described in the Annual Register as \\"a forcible and written argument in favour of universal military training\\". (quoted in ) Wodehouse \\"transforms the established pattern by reversing all expectations\\". Not only is Britain unprepared for invasion, the public shows a complete disregard for the invasion ‚Äì except as a source of entertainment. And the invading armies are defeated not by the might of Britain's military, but by the cunning stratagems of an unknown \\"Man of Destiny\\", the 14-year-old Clarence Chugwater, assisted by his band of Boy Scouts. \\"Wodehouse concocted a preposterous plot which, unlike his models, was preposterous by intent.\\" References and sources ;References ;Sources  *  External links  * The Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with photos of book covers and a list of characters * Free eBook of The Swoop at Project Gutenberg * Novels by P.

It is situated beside the Klang District Education Office. It is a male-only school from Form 1 to Form 5. At the Sixth Form level, where students take their STPM, the classes have both male and female. Klang High School was one of the top-performing schools in Selangor during the British governance and until today, it is still among the respected schools in Selangor. Since its establishment, the school has produced numerous talents serving for the nation and overseas. In Klang, it is one of the most reputable schools known among Klang people. History Klang High School was originally named Temporary English School and was open to students in Klang on 14 January 1928 with the beginning of the academic school year. At the beginning, the school conducted the class in a small hut at the current sports field of the school. English was taught to a small multi- cultural group of junior high school students. The British government could feel the need of English education for this local community in Klang. Thus, after gaining approval from the British central government in Malaya, the school was given better facilities by the British government, particularly the buildings currently named \\"Block A\\" and \\"Block B\\". The main school block (Block A) was officiated by the Sultan of Selangor on 20 March 1930. During the World War II, the small school struggled to remain open on a regular basis and in 1941, it was used by the British as the headquarters of the Medical Auxiliary Service for Klang. There were two doctors assisted by 52 nurses. However, the school went into ruin when the Japanese army invaded Klang. Innocent civilians serving the school were killed by the Japanese army and the school's facilities were damaged during the war. During the Japanese invasion, the school was used as a military base and also as medical camp. The school reopened after World War II having been used as a military hospital by the British Military Authority and the Japanese army.

He was also a journalist, publishing articles in his party's newspaper called 'Afghan Millat'. Shams had recently returned to his homeland after twenty-seven years in exile and had opened an office for his party in Jalalabad.  Early years  Shams, an ethnic Pashtun, was born in Nurgal in the Kunar province of Afghanistan. In 1984, the founder of Afghan Social Democratic Party, Ghulam Mohammad Farhad, died. Three years later in 1987, Shams was elected as the new head of the party. The party then began to split into 3 factions, one led by Shams-ul-Huda Shams, another by Qudratullah Hadad and the third by Mohammad Amin Wakman. Wakman's faction is now led by Afghan Finance Minister Anwar Ul Haq Ahady. During the early days of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Shams established a base for his party in Peshawar, Pakistan. He led his party in the face of strong opposition from religious extremist parties on one hand and the incumbent communist regime on the other. Shams had an uncompromising attitude towards communism, that is why he never agreed to strike a deal with the Soviet-backed government of Kabul in spite of repeated attempts by the latter, up to the point of offering him a cabinet position. Shams was in favor of the establishment of a modern democratic government in the country which could retain its National Islamic character. After the removal of Mohammad Najibullah's Soviet-backed government and Mujahideen take over of Afghanistan, shams continued his opposition with the incumbent regime of religious parties, which he argued, was not representing the majority of Afghan nation. Shams was especially against the Taliban government that was backed by Pakistan. While in Peshawar, Shams continued to publish his party's newspaper Afghan Mellat which published articles that produced nationalistic sentiments and called for democratic development in the war-ravaged Afghanistan. Besides writing in his party's journal, Shams also contributed scholarly articles and essays to other newspapers and journals. A unique feature in his writings was that he described facts regardless of its outcome. Shams kept a close friendly relationship with Pakhtun Nationalist Parties and Pashto literary organizations of Pakistan, especially Pakhtunkhwa Qawmi Party of Afzal Khan Lala. Shams's death was widely mourned by Afghans all over the world. After the death of Shamsul Huda Shams, the party congress held an emergency meeting and elected Ajmal Shams as the new president of the Afghan Mellat Party.

It also was an important tool in legitimizing the Kuomintang controlled Republic of China government that retreated from Mainland China to Taiwan in 1949. 1912-1949 Because the national government of this time was weak, it was difficult for any censorship or propagandistic measures to be carried out effectively. However, a bureau was set up to control the production and release of film in China. Also, newspapers unfavorable to the central government could be harassed at will. After the Northern Expedition, the power of the central government increased significantly, and propaganda campaigns became more effective.

Performing Songwriter. Issue 95.

Early years  Solomon Popoli Linda was born near Pomeroy, on the labor reserve Msinga, Umzinyathi District Municipality in Ladysmith in Natal, where he was familiar with the traditions of amahubo and izingoma zomshado (wedding songs) music.Frith, Simon, Popular Music: critical concepts in media and cultural studies, Volume 4, London: Routledge, 2004. . p. 271Erlmann, Veit, Music, Modernity, and the Global Imagination: South Africa and the West, New York & Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999. He attended the Gordon Memorial mission school, where he learned about Western musical culture, hymns, and participated in choir contests. Influenced by the new syncopated music that had been introduced into South Africa from the US during the 1880s, he included it in the Zulu songs he and his friends sang at weddings and feasts.Malan, Rian, \\"In the Jungle\\", Rolling Stone, 25 May 2000. Retrieved 2007-06-19. ColdType Press, September 2003. In 1931, Linda, like many other young African men at that time, left his homestead to find menial work in Johannesburg, by then a sprawling gold-mining town with a great demand for cheap labour. He worked in the Mayi Mayi Furniture Shop on Small Street and sang in a choir known as the Evening Birds, managed by his uncles, Solomon and Amon Madondo, and which disbanded in 1933.Erlmann, Veit, \\"Imbube: The Career of Solomon Linda\\", in African Stars: studies in Black South African performance, University of Chicago Press, 1991, pp. 165-67. . Linda found employment at Johannesburg's Carlton Hotel and started a new group that retained the Evening Birds name. The members of the group were Solomon Linda (soprano), Gilbert Madondo (alto), Boy Sibiya (tenor), with Gideon Mkhize, Samuel Mlangeni, and Owen Sikhakhane as basses. They were all Linda's friends from Pomeroy. The group evolved from performances at weddings to choir competitions. Linda's musical popularity grew with the Evening Birds, who presented \\"a very cool urban act that wears pinstriped suits, bowler hats and dandy two-tone shoes\\". \\"Mbube\\" After Linda started working at the Gallo Record Company's Roodepoort plant in 1939 as a record packer,\\"Gallo Golden Anniversary: 1926-1976\\", Billboard, 5 February 1977. \\"In the same studios [Gallo's studio in Johannesburg] originated 'Wimoweh' ('The Lion Sleeps Tonight') first brought to the microphone as 'Mbube' by Solomon Linda, then a semi-professional with a job on the Gallo payroll as a record packer\\". the Evening Birds were witnessed by company talent scout Griffith Motsieloa. Italian immigrant Eric Gallo owned what at that time was sub-Saharan Africa's only recording studio. In 1939, while recording a number of songs in the studio, Linda improvised the song \\"Mbube\\" (Lion). \\"Mbube\\" was a major success for Linda and the Evening Birds, reportedly selling more than 100,000 copies in South Africa by 1949. The recording was produced by Motsieloa at the Gallo Recording Studios, in Johannesburg. Linda sold the rights to Gallo Record Company for 10 shillings (less than US$2) soon after the recording was made. However, it is alleged that, by British laws then in effect, those rights should have reverted to Linda's heirs 25 years after his death in 1962. In 1948, the Evening Birds disbanded, and a year later Linda married Regina. While raising a family he continued to perform. His song \\"Mbube\\" had made him well known in South Africa. Linda is credited with a number of musical innovations that came to dominate the isicathamiya style. Instead of using one singer per voice part, the Evening Birds used a number of bass singers. He introduced the falsetto main voice, which incorporated female vocal texture into male singing. His group was the first known to use striped suits to indicate that they were urban sophisticates. At the same time, their bass singing retained some musical elements indicative of traditional choral music. Some of Linda's music can be interpreted as expressing political dissent. For example, \\"Yethulisgqoko\\" (\\"Take off your hat\\", Gallo GE 887) recalls treatment by Pass Office officials, and ends with the words \\"Sikhalela izwe lakithi\\" (\\"We cry for our country\\"). Such expressions were an occasional feature of Mbube songs. Groups such as The Alexandrians were associated with the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union in Johannesburg. Alan Lomax The original South African recording was discovered during the early 1950s by American musicologist Alan Lomax, who gave it to his friend, folk musician Pete Seeger of The Weavers. Seeger retitled it \\"Wimoweh\\", an approximate phonetic rendering of the song's Zulu language refrain, \\"uyimbube\\" (\\"you are a lion\\", from \\"u-\\" [\\"you\\"], \\"yi-\\" [\\"are\\"] and \\"imbube\\" [\\"lion\\"]),https://isizulu.net/ and it was introduced to America by The Weavers; they recorded a studio version in 1952 which became a Top 20 hit in the US, as well as an influential live version recorded at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and released in April 1957. The Weavers' version was subsequently covered by The Kingston Trio in 1959. The Weavers' Carnegie Hall version was also the inspiration for the 1961 version recorded by popular music group The Tokens, for whom English lyrics were written by George David Weiss and retitled \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\"; this is the version which most people are familiar with. (However, at the time, 1961‚Äì62, a fast-tempo version by the Karl Denver Trio was the more successful in the UK.) Death Despite the popularity and wide use of the song, Linda died impoverished in 1962 of kidney failure. It was not until 18 years later that a tombstone was constructed at his gravesite. Rediscovery In 2000, South African journalist Rian Malan wrote a feature article for the magazine Rolling Stone, describing Linda's story and estimating that the song had earned US$15 million for its use in The Lion King alone. Malan and the South African filmmaker Fran√ßois Verster cooperated to make a television documentary called A Lion's Trail that tells Solomon Linda's story, and which was screened by PBS. In 2004, with the backing of the South African government and Gallo Records, Linda's descendants in South Africa sued The Walt Disney Company for its use in The Lion King movie and stage musical without paying royalties to them. The story of the lawsuit against Disney and the aftermath of the settlement is told in the 2019 Netflix documentary, The Lion's Share. Settlement In February 2006, Linda's estate attained a legal settlement with Abilene Music company, which had the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney. This settlement applies to worldwide rights, not just South African, since 1987. The money will go to a trust, to be administered by SA Music Rights CEO Nick Motsatsi. A trial was scheduled to start on 21 February 2006, but just before the trial, a settlement was reached between Linda's estate, Disney and Abilene Music Company, the true defendant of the litigation, who had granted an indemnity to Disney when it licensed use of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" in The Lion King. The primary outcomes of the settlement were: *The estate was to receive payment for past uses of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" and an entitlement to future royalties from its worldwide use. *\\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" was to be acknowledged as derived from \\"Mbube\\". *Solomon Linda was to be acknowledged as a co-composer of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" and to be designated as such in the future. *A trust was to be formed to administer the estate's copyright in \\"Mbube\\" and to receive on their behalf the payments due from the use of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\".Dean, Owen, \\"Copyright in the Courts: The Return of the Lion\\", WIPO Magazine, April 2006.(pdf of full issue) References External links *PBS: The Lion's Trail *The World: Global Hit: Solomon Linda * *\\"Groundbreaking SA lawsuit sends a message to the world‚Äôs cultural power-brokers\\", SA Music News, Thursday, 16 February 2006. *Mark Steyn, The Lion Sleeps Tonight. * Media * Sample of \\"Mbube\\" performed by Solomon Linda's \\"Original Evening Birds\\" (opens directly in a WMA-compatible media player]. * Scanned image of Linda's original Gallotone recording. 1909 births 1962 deaths Deaths from kidney failure People from Umzinyathi District Municipality Zulu people South African composers South African male composers South African musicians South African male singers 20th-century South African musicians 20th-century South African singers 20th-century composers 20th-century male singers ","title":"Solomon Linda"},{"id":"3499096","text":"Patriot Games is a 1992 American action thriller film directed by Phillip Noyce and based on Tom Clancy's 1987 novel of the same name. The film is a sequel to the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, but with different actors in the leading roles, Harrison Ford starring as Jack Ryan and Anne Archer as his wife. James Earl Jones reprises his role as Admiral James Greer. The cast also includes Sean Bean, Patrick Bergin, Thora Birch, Samuel L. Jackson, James Fox, and Richard Harris. The film premiered in theaters in the United States on June 5, 1992 and spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. The following film in the series, Clear and Present Danger, also starred Ford and Archer. Plot Retired CIA analyst Jack Ryan is on vacation with his family in London. Ryan and his family witness an assassination attempt on Lord William Holmes, Minister of State for Northern Ireland only for Ryan to intervene. Injured in the attack, Ryan kills two of the assailants, one being Patrick Miller, while his older brother Sean looks on. The remaining attackers flee as Sean is apprehended by the police. While recovering, Ryan is called to testify in court against Miller, who is part of a splinter cell of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Miller is convicted for his crimes and swears revenge against Ryan. The leader of the splinter cell, Kevin O'Donnell, meets with IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon, who tricks O'Donnell into going into an ambush so he can be assassinated by hitmen. O'Donnell turns the tables on his attackers and kills them all while O'Donnell's lover, Annette, assassinates Reardon. While being transferred to HM Prison Albany on the Isle of Wight, Miller's escort convoy is ambushed by his comrades, including O'Donnell, who execute the police officers and coordinate an escape. Miller and his companions flee to North Africa to plan another kidnapping attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller persuades several members of the group to accompany him to the United States, where he plans to eliminate Ryan and his family. Annette and fellow terrorist Ned Clark attempt to assassinate Ryan outside the United States Naval Academy, but Ryan notices Clark following him. Clark overwhelms Ryan, only to be shot by a Marine guard. Miller and a henchman attack Ryan's pregnant wife Cathy and their daughter Sally on a busy highway, injuring them both. Enraged over the attack on his family, Ryan decides to go back to work for the CIA, having earlier rejected the appeal of his former superior, Vice Admiral James Greer. Ryan's analysis leads him to conclude that Miller has taken refuge in a training camp in North Africa. A Special Air Service team kills everyone in the camp while Ryan looks on through a live satellite feed. Unbeknownst to Ryan, Miller and his companions have left the camp and are on their way to the U.S. to stage their next attack. Lord Holmes decides to visit Ryan at his home to present his honorary knighthood in recognition of his role in foiling the first attack on Holmes. With the aid of Holmes' traitorous assistant, Miller's group tracks Holmes to Ryan's coast-side home in Maryland. The team kill the DSS agents and state troopers guarding the residence, and make an attempt to kidnap Lord Holmes. Ryan leads Holmes and his family to safety. The FBI's Hostage Rescue Team scrambles to pick up Holmes. Ryan develops a ruse to leave his family and Lord Holmes behind, near the shoreline, while racing away from the coast on a boat. Miller, O'Donnell and Annette follow suit, and chase him in a secondary boat. Upon realizing that Ryan is leading them away from Holmes, O'Donnell and Annette try to persuade him to turn around, but an enraged Miller kills them both and continues his pursuit of Ryan. Miller reaches Ryan's boat, jumps aboard, and attacks Ryan. During their fight, Ryan impales Miller on an anchor, killing him. Ryan jumps clear of the boat before it crashes into several rocks, and is rescued by an FBI helicopter. Sometime later, Cathy receives a call from her obstetrician; giving her the baby's latest test results. Cast Samuel L. Jackson portrayed Robby Jackson. Production =Casting= The actors who played Jack and Caroline Ryan in The Hunt for Red October, Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden, did not appear in the film. Baldwin was in negotiations to reprise his role, but committed to perform in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway. In 2011, Baldwin claimed the role was recast due to David Kirkpatrick forcing him to choose between performing in A Streetcar Named Desire or agreeing to an open-ended clause relating to dates for the first sequel. Baldwin further claimed this occurred after a famous actor, widely believed to be the film's eventual star Harrison Ford, offered to play Ryan and was favored by both the studio and the director John McTiernan due to a large debt owed to him from an unproduced film. McTiernan had originally desired Ford in the role in the first film and confirmed that \\"there was a great deal of scheming that went on to push Alec out of that part.\\" Kirkpatrick responded to Baldwin's claims by saying that negotiations with him to reprise the role had already broken due to his insistence on script approval. McTiernan initially wanted to direct an adaptation of Clear and Present Danger using a script written by John Milius. After the studio opted to adapt Patriot Games, he declined to direct because of his Irish-American background and was replaced with Phillip Noyce. In the original novel, the assassination attempt was made on the Prince of Wales and many members of the British royal family appeared as important characters. As a result, they were replaced with fictitious characters in the screenplay, with Prince Charles being replaced by Lord Holmes, a nonexistent cousin of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. =Filming= The movie was filmed on location in areas around London, at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and at Pinewood Studios.Movies: Mr. Nice Guy Dives Back Into Action Welkos, Robert M.

Test audiences responded negatively to the original ending, which had Jack Ryan and Sean Miller fighting underwater. The ending was re- shot with a more explosive finale.The End Kelley, Bill. The Sun Sentinel, June 21, 1992.Paramount to reshoot 'Patriot Games' ending The numerous changes between the film and the novel caused Clancy to distance himself from the film production. Clancy was unhappy with the script and during production asked for his name to be taken off the film. He complained that the final attack scene was \\"unrealistic\\" and that he had not been shown any rushes. He said he was not sure a film would be made of Clear and Present Danger \\"because I think Patriot Games will turn out so bad.\\" =Music= On June 9, 1992, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the RCA Records music label. The film's musical score was composed by James Horner and contains musical references to works by Aram Khachaturian (Adagio from \\"Gayane\\" Suite) and Dmitri Shostakovich (Symphony No. 5, 3rd mvt.). A music video is shown in an early scene featuring Clannad's song \\"Theme from Harry's Game\\", originally made for an ITV drama about The Troubles in 1982. All other vocal performances featured on the soundtrack were performed by Maggie Boyle. In 2013, a 2-disc expanded soundtrack album was released by La-La Land Records. Limited to 3000 copies, the album contains over 50 minutes of previously unreleased music (including cues by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and John Philip Sousa). Reception =Critical reception= Despite receiving generally positive reviews, the film garnered controversy during its release, from Tom Clancy disowning the film, to critics complaining it was too different from the book. Nonetheless the film has earned a 73% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Patriot Games doesn't win many points for verisimilitude, but some entertaining set pieces -- and Harrison Ford in the central role -- more than compensate for its flaws.\\" Roger Ebert called it \\"absorbing\\" while also commenting how actor Harrison Ford \\"once again demonstrates what a solid, convincing actor he is\\". Chris Hicks of the Deseret News mentioned how director Noyce gave the film \\"flourish and tension\\" while star Harrison Ford injected \\"a commanding sense of decency and humanity to the role of CIA analyst Jack Ryan, making it his own.\\" =Box office= The film was a financial success, debuting at the number one position for the weekend of June 5, 1992. During that weekend, the film grossed $18,511,191 in business showing at 2,365 locations. The film's revenue dropped by 39.5% in its second week of release, earning $11,208,134. For that particular weekend, the film remained in 1st place with an increased theater count of 2,396. Patriot Games went on to top out domestically at $83,351,587 in ticket sales and $94,700,000 in foreign business for a worldwide total of $178,051,587 through an initial 9-week theatrical run. For 1992 as a whole, the film would cumulatively rank at a box office performance position of 14.

Trafficators are often located at the door pillar. History They first appeared in the 1900s, when they were actuated either mechanically or pneumatically. In 1908, Alfredo Barrachini in Rome added electric lights inside the arms that turned on as they extended, but operation was still by a cable system. Electric operation came in 1918 when the Naillik Motor Signal Company of Boston added electric motor drive. This system was superseded by two French inventors, Gustave Deneef and Maurice Boisson, who used a linear solenoid in 1923. The final complete system came in 1927 when Berlin-based Max Ruhl and Ernst Neuman combined internal illumination and solenoid operation. The shape of the trafficator arm is closely based upon the shape of the semaphore signal arm used by the Royal Bavarian Railway beginning in 1890. The only difference from the railway arm is that it is halved down its length so as to fit flush with the vehicle's exterior. They were common on vehicles until the introduction of the flashing amber, red or white indicators at or near the corners of the vehicle (and often along the sides as well). They have been increasingly rare since the 1950s, as ever-stricter legislation has prescribed the need for the modern type of flashing signal. Many historic vehicles (e.g. pre-1960 Volkswagen Beetle) that are used on today's roads have had their trafficators supplemented or replaced with modern indicators to aid visibility and to meet legislative requirements. Trafficators can now be fitted with flashing lights as an upgrade. References * The Motor Car: Its Evolution and Engineering Development. John Day. Bosch Ltd., 1975. .

Biography Paget was born in 1885 to Lord Alexander Paget, third son of Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey, and to the Hon. Hester Alice Stapleton- Cotton, daughter of Wellington Stapleton-Cotton, 2nd Viscount Combermere. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1905, he succeeded as Marquess of Anglesey on the demise of his childless cousin, the 5th Marquess. He was also Earl of Uxbridge, Baron Paget, and the 9th Baronet Paget, of Plas Newydd. Career Anglesey briefly served in the Royal Horse Guards before his election as Mayor of Burton upon Trent from 1911 to 1912. Within the first month of the First World War, he rejoined the Royal Horse Guards and was sent to France, but was invalided out. He returned to serve as aide-de-camp to Sir John Maxwell, the General Officer Commanding in Egypt ‚Äì for which he was decorated with the Order of the Nile (4th class) in 1918 ‚Äì and to Sir William Birdwood in Gallipoli. He later served as Assistant Military Secretary to the General Officer Commanding in Ireland in 1916. He served in the Home Guard in World War II. The 6th Marquess of Anglesey was Lord Chamberlain to Queen Mary from 1922 until his death in 1947. In the 1928 New Year Honours, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). In 1931, he was invested as an Officer in the Order of Saint John, and promoted to Commander of the Order in 1944. During the Second World War, he served in the Home Guard, and was Lord Lieutenant of Anglesey from 1942 until his death. Marriage and children On 3 August 1912, he married Lady Victoria Manners, a daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland, in a grand ceremony performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and attended by Prince Arthur of Connaught. They had six children: *Lady Alexandra Mary Cecilia Caroline Paget (15 June 1913 ‚Äì ), married Sir Michael Duff, 3rd Baronet *Lady Elizabeth Hester Mary Paget (1916‚Äì1980), married Raimund von Hofmannsthal, son of Hugo von Hofmannsthal *Lady Mary Patricia Beatrice Rose Paget (19 January 1918 ‚Äì ), died unmarried *Lady Rose Mary Primrose Paget (27 July 1919 ‚Äì ), married Hon. John Francis McLaren *George Charles Henry Victor Paget, Earl of Uxbridge (afterwards 7th Marquess) (8 October 1922 ‚Äì ) *Lady Katharine Mary Veronica Paget (8 Oct 1922 ‚Äì 7 February 2017 (aged 94)), married (1) Jocelyn Eustace Gurney, (2) Charles Farrell The Marquess died in London, aged 61, following an operation. Residences Until World War I, the 6th Marquess of Anglesey mainly lived at Beaudesert, the Paget family estate and stately home on the southern edge of Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. Heavy taxation after the war (combined with the considerable debts resulting from the extravagant lifestyle of the 5th Marquess) meant that the 6th Marquess could no longer afford to maintain the property at Beaudesert, so in 1920 he left to live at Plas Newydd. The Beaudesert estate was broken up and sold off, with the Marquess donating 120 acres of land to the Cannock Chase District in 1920, and a further gift in 1938 was made to the people of Staffordshire. At Plas Newydd, the 6th Marquess commissioned the artist Rex Whistler to undertake a decorative mural scheme. The trompe l'oeil paintings and murals and a permanent exhibition of Whistler memorabilia are now one of the major attractions at the property.

G. Wodehouse. The basic plot first appeared in a novella, The Gem Collector, in the December 1909 issue of Ainslee's Magazine. It was substantially revised and expanded for publication as a book under the title The Intrusion of Jimmy, by W. J. Watt and Co., New York, on 11 May 1910.McIlvaine 1990, p. 21 It was serialised under that title in the British weekly magazine Tit-Bits between 11 June and 10 SeptemberMcIlvaine 1990, p. 187 before being published as A Gentleman of Leisure by Alston Rivers Ltd, London, on 15 November 1910. There are minor textual differences between the American and British editions of the book.Jasen 1986, p. 37 A Gentleman of Leisure was adapted for the stage in 1911 and has twice been filmed, in 1915 and 1923.  Plot summary (A Gentleman of Leisure)  The action begins with bachelor Jimmy Pitt in New York; having fallen in love on a transatlantic liner, he befriends a small-time burglar and breaks into a police captain's house as a result of a bet. The cast of characters head to England, and from there on it is a typically Wodehousean romantic story, set at the stately Dreever Castle, overflowing with imposters, detectives, crooks, scheming lovers and conniving aunts.  Main characters  * Sir James Willoughby Pitt, baronet, a well-off young man and former jewel thief ** Spike Mullins, a thief, who becomes Pitt's valet * Molly McEachern, a pretty girl Pitt saw on a boat ** John McEachern, Molly's father, a policeman * \\"Spennie\\", Earl of Dreever, an impecunious young Earl ** Lady Julia Blunt, Spennie's imperious aunt ** Sir Thomas Blunt, her wealthy husband * Charteris, a keen organiser of amateur theatre * Hargate, a card-sharp who preys on Lord Dreever  Full plot (The Gem Collector)  Sir James Willoughby Pitt, baronet, a former jewel thief who was expelled from Eton and has since inherited wealth, is in London and bored with life. Seeing a stranger in need in a restaurant, he comes to his aid, and so befriends Spennie Blunt. He later encounters Spike Mullins, a former American criminal associate, who has fled to England and fallen on hard times. Pitt takes him in. Spennie invites Jimmy to his home, Corven Abbey in Shropshire (Dreever Castle in the later version), and he decides to take Spike with him as his valet. While there, Jimmy encounters Molly McEachern, with whom he was romantically linked (at least by Spike)The Gem Collector, chapter 2 while in New York. Molly is the daughter of John McEachern, formerly a corrupt New York police officer, now prominent in English society and married to Spennie's mother. The broad outline of the plot then continues as in A Gentleman of Leisure, though the tone is substantially different: in The Gem Collector, Jimmy had been a jewel thief; in A Gentleman of Leisure he merely pretends to be one.  Full plot (A Gentleman of Leisure)  Wealthy Jimmy Pitt falls for a girl on the boat back from England. In New York he finds his old cronies excited by Love, the Cracksman, a new play in the Raffles vein. He makes a bet with his friend Arthur Mifflin, star of the play ‚Äì he will break into a house that very night. Brooding on how to accomplish such a feat, his house is broken into by Spike Mullins, whom he persuades to accompany him on his mission. They pick a house recommended to Mullins by a friend, and break in, only to be caught by John McEachern, whom they convince that Pitt is a prominent London jewel thief. He arranges to be paid off, but his daughter Molly enters, and she and Jimmy recognise each other from their boat-trip. To keep his graft a secret, McEachern pretends to Molly that Pitt is a friendly passer-by. After a year wandering the globe, unable to find or forget Molly, Pitt is in London once more. Seeing a stranger in need in a restaurant, he comes to his aid, and so befriends Lord Dreever, known to all as Spennie. Wandering the streets with his new friend, they run into Spike Mullins, Jimmy's only link to Molly, who has fallen on hard times. Pitt takes him in. Next day, Spennie invites Jimmy to Dreever Castle, and he decides to take Spike with him as his valet. Spennie's Aunt Julia, we learn, owns a valuable necklace, and her husband Sir Thomas has hired a detective to protect it. Arriving at Dreever, there is no space in the car, so Jimmy volunteers to walk. He catches a riderless horse, and when he finds the rider, it is none other than Molly, who is also staying at Dreever. Her father is highly suspicious of Jimmy, even more so when he sees Spike also on the premises, but is unable to denounce them for fear of his own secret coming out, so he hires a detective to keep an eye on them. The house party prepares for some amateur theatricals, and it becomes clear to Jimmy that a plot is afoot to bring Molly and Spennie together. They are soon bullied into an engagement, although Spennie loves another and Molly sees Spennie as a little boy. Pitt makes an enemy of Hargate, a hustler he recognises trying to fleece Spennie, while Spike spots the detectives hired by McEachern and Blunt around the house. Jimmy dodges them, and drags Molly out onto the lake, where he declares his love; she returns it, but happiness is scuppered by her fear of upsetting her father. Meanwhile, Spennie is once more sharped by the hustler, who asks him to drive Pitt from the castle, and Spike, after observing Sir Thomas' detective arrest Galer, the man hired by McEachern, takes advantage of the lull in vigilance to swipe the precious necklace. Spennie, desperate to repay his debts, is reduced to stealing from his uncle, but is caught and stopped by Molly. Hearing a noise, they hide in Sir Thomas' dressing-room, and see Pitt enter, to return the jewels stolen by Spike. They confront him, and he explains about the bet that led him to Molly's house, and his dubious man Mullins; he also unmasks Hargate as a card sharp. Spennie hides just in time as his uncle enters, catching Pitt with the jewels. Pitt reveals the necklace is a fake, and Spennie uses the power of his uncle's secret to regain his independence. The young lord then tells McEachern of his daughter's affection for Pitt, just before the big ex-policeman is arrested by Blunt's detective, for being in league with Galer. Pitt helps him clear his name, and explains to McEachern the background to the similar mix-up that chilled relations between the two of them, offering Arthur Mifflin, now in London with a new play, as witness to the bet which started it all. McEachern is persuaded to come clean to his daughter. Pitt and Molly marry, and Spike returns to America, disappointed that his idol turned down the gems ‚Äì until he learns they were fake... The rewriting process shows complexities not easily explained. For example, the later version has new features more appropriate for, but not included in, the original version, e.g., Jimmy's habitual carrying of a flashlight suitable for burglaryA Gentleman of Leisure, chapter 25 and detailed knowledge of white jargoon.A Gentleman of Leisure, chapter 27 It also contains some apparent self-criticism of its own implausibilities, e.g., \\"a series of the most workmanlike miracles\\".A Gentleman of Leisure, chapter 13. Cp. \\"almost to the extent of making him wish that he really could have been the desperado McEachern fancied him\\", chapter 22 These implausibilities, e.g., impostors as guests at a castle, mistaken identities which could be easily explained but are not, and unlikely encounters with old acquaintances, become common in Wodehouse's later works set in English castes, most notably Blandings Castle. Adaptations =Theatre= In 1911, Wodehouse and playwright John Stapleton collaborated in adapting A Gentleman of Leisure as a stage play. Starring Douglas Fairbanks and Ruth Shepley as Jimmy and Molly, the play opened on 24 August 1911Davis 1993, p.40 at New York's Playhouse Theatre.Green 1981, p.71 The play was revived at McVicker's Theatre in Chicago on 30 March 1913 under the title A Thief for a Night with John Barrymore and Alice Brady in the lead roles.McIlvaine 1990, p. 301 When the UK edition of A Gentleman of Leisure was reissued in March 1921, Wodehouse replaced an earlier dedication with one to Douglas Fairbanks \\"who many years ago played 'Jimmy' in the dramatised version of this novel\\". =Film= In 1915, the stage version of A Gentleman of Leisure became the first of Wodehouse's works to be made into a silent film. It starred Wallace Eddinger as Jimmy and Carol Holloway as Molly. Cecil B. DeMille was credited as the third scriptwriter, behind Stapleton and Wodehouse.McIlvaine 1990, p. 306 In 1923, the film was remade as A Gentleman of Leisure, directed by Joseph Henabery.

Anfus is now the name of a district in the oldest part of Casablanca, located in the Casablanca-Settat region of Morocco.

From there they obtained a special dye, that colored the purple stripe in Imperial Roman Senatorial togas. The expedition of Juba II to discover the Canary islands and Madeira probably departed from Anfa. The Roman port, probably called Anfus, was part of a Berber client state of Rome until Emperor Augustus. When Rome annexed Ptolemy of Mauretania's kingdom, Anfa was incorporated into the Roman Empire by Caligula. But this was done only nominally because the Roman limes was a few dozen kilometers north of the port (the Roman military fortifications of Mauretania Tingitana were just a few kilometers south of the Roman colonia named Sala Colonia). However, Roman Anfa --connected mainly by commerce and by socio-cultural ties to Volubilis (autonomous from Rome since 285 AD)--lasted until the 5th century, when Vandals conquered Roman northwestern Africa. A Roman wreck of the 2nd century, from which were salvaged 169 silver coins, shows that the Romans appreciated this useful port for commerce. There is even evidence of oil commerce with Roman Volubilis and Tingis in the 3rd century. Meanwhile, a large Berber tribe, the Berghouata, settled in the area between the rivers Bou Regreg to the north and Oum er-Rbia to the south of the Roman port.Roman Anfa Consequently, the independent Berber kingdom called Barghawata, in the area then named Anfa, arose around in 744 AD, and continued until it was conquered by the new Berber kingdom of the Almoravids in 1068 AD. Leo Africanus defined Anfa as a Roman city in his famous Della descrittione dell‚ÄôAfrica et delle cose notabili che ivi sono (Description of Africa), written in the 16th century.

The area became an independent kingdom ruled by Barghawata from 744 CE until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. From the 14th century, under the Marinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again. It also became a safe harbour for pirates, which led to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who destroyed the town in 1468. It was used by the Portuguese, who called it Casablanca, as a military fortress from 1515. Anfa is today to the west of central Casablanca, and was the name of one of the city's two airports before being closed in 2007. The region around Casablanca is named Casa-Anfa. The neighborhood of Anfa is the most upper-class and westernized in the city. Subdivisions The district is divided into three arrondissements: *Anfa (ÿ£ŸÜŸÅÿß) *Ma√¢rif (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿßÿ±ŸäŸÅ) *Sidi Belyout (ÿ≥ŸäÿØŸä ÿ®ŸÑŸäŸàÿ∑) See also * Casablanca * Timeline of Casablanca References External links * A 1572 map of Anfa, after an unidentified Portuguese original.

Life Theweleit was born in Ebenrode, East Prussia (now Nesterov, Russia), the son of a railway company worker and a Jewish mother. He wrote the following about his father: \\"Above all he was a railroader, wholeheartedly, as he used to say, and then a human being. He was a rather good human being and a good fascist. His beatings which he gave away abundantly and brutally as it was usual in his time and with the best of intentions were the first lessons I received on fascism, a fact I only later fully discovered.\\"M√§nnerphantasien Theweleit studied German studies and English studies in Kiel and Freiburg. From 1969‚Äì1972, he worked as a freelancer for a public radio station (S√ºdwestfunk). He wrote his dissertation Freikorpsliteratur und der K√∂rper des soldatischen Mannes about Freikorps narratives, a sub-literature produced by paramilitaries organized in Freikorps, who, during the early Weimar republic, had fought external or internal enemies. In academia only few historians had read and analysed this literature before Theweleit. His book M√§nnerphantasien (1977); translated as Male Fantasies (1987), a study of the \\"proto-fascist consciousness\\" in general and the bodily experience of these former soldiers in particular, was well received and much discussed. Throughout the book Theweleit uses ideas, terminology and empirical experience from works of Margaret Mahler, Wilhelm Reich, Gilles Deleuze, F√©lix Guattari, Melanie Klein, and Michel Foucault among others to develop his theory of the \\"fascist male imprinting and socialization\\". In the introduction, Theweleit points out that discussions with Margaret Berger and his wife Monika Theweleit-Kubale (both of whom have professional clinical experience) had an important influence on the book as well as the feedback from Erhard Lucas, a leading German left-wing historian of the Weimar Unrest.M√§nnerphantasien, Vol 1 Rowohlt, Reinbek October 1983, (Paperpack Pdition) p. 9&10 Theweleit writes in a non-orthodox, highly personal and associative style. His book are heavily illustrated with cartoons, advertisements, engravings, posters and artwork. Theweleit lives in Freiburg, he teaches in Germany, the United States, Switzerland, and Austria. He was a lecturer at the Institute of Sociology at the University of Freiburg and lecturer at the film academy in Berlin.

Sam Wo Public School in Muk Wu Village on Tsung Chai Ling off Lin Ma Hang Road Muk Wu Village sign post Muk Wu Village () is a Punti walled village in Ta Kwu Ling, in the north of the New Territories across the Man Kam To border crossing point in Hong Kong. Before January 4, 2016, it was inaccessible to non-permit holders (see Closed Area Permit). These were obtained in Fanling, Sheung Shui Closed Area Permit police station. As the name suggests, originally the village had fertile land with trees and streams derived from the Chinese characters: \\"wood\\" (); \\"lake\\" (). This name derived from the location on the northern periphery right next to the border fence; the Shenzhen River is only a few feet away. Features The village road meanders down into the village court and main door. This gate tower and stone floor has the original Qing dynasty design; a few houses have been unoccupied. Within the village there also stands a Tin Hau Temple, village hall (sun teng) or shrine and several Ancestral rooms (xi fong). The temple is decorated and very well kept by the villagers. It was built around 1912-1913.Antiquities and Monuments Offices - Introduction to 1444 Historic Buildings It is located about 50 metres away left as one faces the village door. Man-made water wells are plentiful but the main one where most villagers used to draw water from is large in comparison. Its disuse came about when alternative means of transporting water was sought. Efficient and effective land cultivation was of prime importance and therefore improvements of water pipe systems obviously meant that they no longer had to depend on it. Going through the village gate tower straight down the narrow lane is a derelict building called the village hall (shrine). This building was used for worshiping of idols, wedding receptions, birth ancestral registrations and village gatherings. The two walled partitions can clearly be identified and one half was once used as a school. Ancestral rooms look similar to residential houses from the outside but the presence of idols and offerings is a common feature. There have been archeological finds of ancient kilns unearthed in Muk Wu; details of this can be found in the Hong Kong Museum of History. The famous Muk Wu pumping station is also notable. Apart from the architecture of Muk Wu, nature and wildlife abound, with great Egrets visiting from time to time, and an abundance of exotic insects during hot seasons. Settlers (The Punti people) The village's original settlers were: \\"To\\" (), \\"Wong\\" () and \\"Yam\\"(), where \\"To\\" () remained the dominant surname even at present. Today, there are various families from China unrelated to the early settlers. Each clan's surname has a remarkable history. \\"To\\" () clan trace their roots back to East of Chang'an present day Xi'an, Shaanxi in China. Today, there are only a handful of indigenous villagers living in Muk Wu and visiting relatives of the \\"To\\" () clan. The Chinese festivals such as: Mid-Autumn festival (), Chinese New Year, Ching Ming () and Chung Yeung () \\"paying homage to ancestors\\", attract most tourists and relations of the clans to reunite. During these public holidays especially Ching Ming and Chung Yeung the bus services are very busy and passengers pack buses to the full. The occasion can be quite a sight and the atmosphere is most welcoming and cheerful. Transportation A 73K or 59K bus from Sheung Shui bus station to Man Kam To Bus Terminus serves the village. From the Terminus, visitors must walk at least 70 metres along Lin Ma Hang Road and turn left at the sign post for Muk Wu Village.

Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The book has been widely used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities and is commonly cited as a reference for algorithms in published papers, with over 10,000 citations documented on CiteSeerX. The book sold half a million copies during its first 20 years. Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation \\"CLRS\\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, \\"CLR\\" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest). In the preface, the authors write about how the book was written to be comprehensive and useful in both teaching and professional environments. Each chapter focuses on an algorithm, and discusses its design techniques and areas of application. Instead of using a specific programming language, the algorithms are written in pseudocode. The descriptions focus on the aspects of the algorithm itself, its mathematical properties, and emphasize efficiency. Editions The first edition of the textbook did not include Stein as an author, and thus the book became known by the initialism CLR. It included two chapters (\\"Arithmetic Circuits\\" & \\"Algorithms for Parallel Computers\\") that were dropped in the second edition. After the addition of the fourth author in the second edition, many began to refer to the book as \\"CLRS\\". This first edition of the book was also known as \\"The Big White Book (of Algorithms).\\" With the second edition, the predominant color of the cover changed to green, causing the nickname to be shortened to just \\"The Big Book (of Algorithms).\\" A third edition was published in August 2009. Plans for the next edition started in 2014, but the fourth edition will not be published earlier than 2021.

An Atari 8-bit family port was released in 1981. Space Eggs is an unofficial version of the arcade game Moon Cresta. Gameplay The player moves a ship from side to side across the bottom of the screen while trying to avoid colliding with or being shot by the aliens attacking above. Each level pits the player against multiple aliens of a particular class, which become more difficult to destroy as the levels progress. The game begins with a view of the player's three ships docked together. The first ship, which is the smallest and has only one cannon, splits off from the others and gameplay begins. If an alien touches the ship or successfully hits it with a bomb, the ship is destroyed and replaced by the next one in the set. The second and third ships have progressively wider wingspans and two cannons each. The game ends when all ships are lost. Aliens begin as harmless, multi-colored \\"eggs\\" bobbing randomly above the ship, and must be shot to release the creatures within. There are four classes of aliens: *Spiders, insectoid creatures that move randomly around the screen and are worth 15 points. *Lips, which move a bit more aggressively. They are worth 30 points. *Wolves, which move randomly and often descend to the level of the spaceship. They are worth 45 points. *Fuzzballs, which bounce up and down rapidly if they are to the left of the ship, or move to the bottom of the playfield and slide horizontally toward the ship if they are to the right (guaranteeing destruction; this appears to be a bug). They are worth 80 points. In the first four waves, all eggs hatch to the same creature. In subsequent waves, eggs hatch random creatures. The wave resets to 1 when the player dies. If the ship is in the second stage (medium width), and the player has scored at least 1,000 points, an opportunity to dock with the first stage will be given. The ship descends from the top of the screen and must be caught by lining up with the ship precisely. If successful, the merged ship will have 3 cannons.

Culross Palace from top of its garden, Culross and Firth of Forth in the distance, Aug 2018 Culross Palace is a late 16th - early 17th century merchant's house in Culross, Fife, Scotland. The palace, or \\"Great Lodging\\", was constructed between 1597 and 1611 by Sir George Bruce, the Laird of Carnock. Bruce was a successful merchant who had a flourishing trade with other Forth ports, the Low Countries and Sweden. He had interests in coal mining, salt production, and shipping, and is credited with sinking the world's first coal mine to extend under the sea. Many of the materials used in the construction of the palace were obtained during the course of Bruce's foreign trade. Baltic pine, red pantiles, and Dutch floor tiles and glass were all used. The exterior boasts the use of crow-stepped gables, including a statue of a veiled woman posing on the gable step. The palace features fine interiors, with decorative mural and ceiling painting, 17th and 18th century furniture and a fine collection of Staffordshire and Scottish pottery. Although never a royal residence, James VI visited the Palace in 1617.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities, of King James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), pp. 326-7. The palace is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland who have restored a model seventeenth-century garden, complete with raised beds, a covered walkway and crushed shell paths. The herbs, vegetables and fruit trees planted in the garden are types that were used in the early seventeenth century.

The temple comprises a main structure, a walled compound with citadels, and four ponds around the main structure one of which is within the walls. Koodalmanikyam Temple is the only ancient temple in India dedicated to the worship of Bharata, the third brother of Rama, however the idol is that of Vishnu. \\"Sangameshwara\\"(Lord of the Confluence) is another name associated with the deity at Koodalmanikyam. The temple is one of four in Kerala state that form a set called \\"Nalambalam\\", each temple dedicated to one of the four brothers in Ramayana: Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. The Thachudaya Kaimal as \\"Manikkam Keralar\\"Epistles by Ananthakumara Swami, Thachudaya Kaimal Stanom, Published 1927 Irinjalakkuda India Office Records, London IOR/R/2/882/104 is the spiritual chief and the temporal ruler of the Koodalmanikyam Temple and its Estates. The line goes back to antiquity and is mentioned in the Skanda Purana. The temporal rights over the ancient temple, that is the office of the Kaimal (as opposed to \\"Manikkam Keralar\\") and the office of \\"Melkoyma\\". History The earliest historical reference to Koodalmanikyam Temple is found on a stone inscription attributed to the Chera king Sthanu Ravi Varma dated 854 A.D, donating vast extents of land for the temple. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the temple must have been in existence for quite some time before this date and that even then Koodalmanikyam occupied a place of importance among temples of Kerala. Koodalmanikyam temple plays a key role in the history of Irinjalakuda as most land in and around the region belonged to the Koodalmanikyam Temple and the Thachudaya Kaimals of Travancore until 1971.http://www.godubai.com/gulftoday/articlearc.asp?aid=113418&section;=asia The temple attracts devotees and tourists, a source of revenue for the Government. Rituals and annual festival Elephant parade during the annual festival The custom in most of the temples in Kerala is to have five poojas and three sivelis a day. But in Koodalmanikyam there are only three poojas and no siveli. There is no Usha Puja and Pantheeradi Puja at this shrine. The deity is taken out for ceremonial procession only during the annual festival. There is no deeparadhana. There are plans to start deeparadhana here. This is the only temple without Deeparadhana. Sticks and camphor are not used for the pooja. The floral offerings to the deity consist of lotus, tulasi (ocimum sanctum) and thechi (ixora). But they are not grown in the temple compound. No other flower is taken for pooja or for making garlands. Lotus garland is an important offering to the deity. A garland will be offered to the deity which does have not less than 101 lotus flowers. The temple holds its chief annual festival for ten days each year in the month of Medam (April/May). The first day of the festival is calculated by the appearance of the Uthram asterism and signified by hoisting a ceremonial flag. (The start day falls one day after the famous Thrissur Pooram festival in nearby Thrissur.) Each day of the festival, a seeveli (procession of caparisoned temple elephants) is held twice, once in the morning and once at night, to the accompaniment of Panchari melam (sacred music). Seventeen elephants take part. Two features of the seeveli are unique to the Koodalmanikyam Temple: first that two baby elephants are included in the procession, one standing on each side of the elephant carrying the deity. Second, while the headdresses ('Netti pattam' in Malayalam) of seven elephants are made of pure gold, the rest are made of pure silver. The last two days of the festival feature Panchavadyam (sacred music from an orchestra of five instruments), and the festival ends at the Thiruvonam asterism. Ponds Koodalmanikyam temple and Kulipini Theertham There are four ponds that are located in and around the temple. The largest of the four are Kuttan Kulam, located outside the compound on the eastern side, and Kulipini Theertham, located inside the compound. Kulipini Theertham is believed to have been sanctified by the sage Kulipini Maharishi, who held a great ritual sacrifice, a yajna, at the spot. Water from this source is used for rituals and ceremonies within the temple. Priests are allowed to take part in the ceremonies after clensing themselves at the \\"Kuttan Kulam\\" outside the temple and then have to take a dip in \\"Kulipini Theertham\\" before entering Sanctum Sanctorum. The pond outside the compound located at the western side is called \\"Padinjare Kulam\\" and the pond outside the compound located at the southern side is called \\"Thekke Kulam\\". These three water bodies constitute a significant area as much as the size of the temple itself. Except \\"Kulipini Theertham\\" the other three water bodies are open to the public.

It was first held in 1997, alongside the Great British Beer Festival. Great British Beer Festival Winter is also home to the Champion Winter Beer of Britain awards.  Host city and date  The festival is generally held in January or February of each year; however there were two festivals in 1997, one at each end of the year. The first one gave the awards for 1996/7 and the second for 1997/8; there was no festival in 1998. While the summer event has been exclusive to London since 1991, the Great British Beer Festival Winter moves between host cities, allocated on 3-year cycle. Branches of CAMRA around the United Kingdom bid for the event. Derby was the host city for 2014 to 2016 where the event was held at the Roundhouse. The final Derby festival drew 13,832 attendees, the largest in the event's history. They drank a combined 57,000 pints of the 470 beers on offer.

She is said to have written several books. Karl May intended to write several novels about her, similar to the Winnetou series, but he never got to it. The character changed from the wild and ugly creature of early publications to what he understood as the female Orient counterpart to the Indian chief Winnetou, both personifying mysticism and the ascent from a low, lustful person, rising to become a nobly spirited person. Several times it is referred to her as the soul of mankind.

While typically seen as a Western phenomenon, non-Western cases, most notably that of Imperial Japan, also had colonial cinemas. Colonial films typically idealized life in the colonies by emphasizing the modernizing aspects of colonization. Feature films set in colonial settings typically represented these parts of empire as refuges for colonizers looking to escape life in the metropole. As a result, colonial films frequently did not attempt to reflect the social realities of life in colonized countries. Representations of local characters, places, and customs were regularly presented as escapist, apologetic or overtly racist. Today colonial cinema is an important source to understand the mentality of the colonizing societies.

He played the violin in the Canberra Youth Orchestra and in many local bands such as The Black Dogs, The Plunderers, and The Gadflys. He was a member of, among others, the Doug Anthony Allstars, Found Objects and the Performing Arts Cafe. In 1985 Branson, Ross Cameron, John Utans, and Patrick Troy founded Splinters Theatre of Spectacle which had its origins in mediaevalist antics in Canberra's inner north. Splinters staged several large productions, sometimes involving hundreds of people, fire sculptures, giant puppets, & large moving metal sculptures. Early Splinters performances were at a now-demolished weatherboard cottage in Downer, and the Causeway Hall at Kingston, as well as backyards in the inner north. Splinters made good use of crowd manipulation.Geoffrey Milne, Theatre Australia (Un)limited . page 371 During his time with Splinters he was involved in more than 20 productions including Cry Stinking Fish (1987) as part of the Melbourne Spoleto Festival, Gumboot Full of Blood (1988), Cathedral of Flesh (1992) (winner Best Promenade Theatre Performance Award in the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Guardians of the Concourse (1993, National Festival of Australian Theatre, Canberra), Utopia/Distopia (1995, Springbank Island, Canberra), and Faust - The Heat of Knowledge (1996, 50th Anniversary Celebrations of the Australian National University). After theatre studies in Melbourne, Branson worked as an actor with many different companies including La Mama Theatre. As a director he staged The Threepenny Opera and Handel's Ariodante.

Branson remained a Canberra identity, and divided his time largely between Canberra and Melbourne. In Canberra he hosted the \\"Terrace Sessions\\" at the Terrace Bar, the Gypsy Bar and the \\"Salons at the Street\\" at the Street Theatre, where many avant-garde performances were staged. Branson often accompanying others with impromptu violin or off-the-cuff poesy. Branson coined the moniker \\"Brian Desire\\" for Canberra artist/poet Brian Hincksmann.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Tropidolaemus huttoni is a little-known species of pit viper, a venomous snake in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. The species is endemic to the southern Western Ghats of India. There are no subspecies that are currently recognized. Little is known about this species, as this species is known only from two young individuals, based on which it was first described in 1949. Despite long-term and targeted herpetological surveys in the particular hill range (Meghamalai), it has never been re-sighted there or elsewhere since then. A possible third specimen from the northern Western Ghats is considered to be of doubtful identity at best, as it shares several features typical of T. wagleri complex as well; and its provenance is also currently unresolved. Etymology The specific name, huttoni, is in honor of its discoverer, Angus Finlay Hutton, a planter and naturalist.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Tropidolaemus huttoni, p. 128). Description The coloration and size of adults of T. huttoni is unknown. Juveniles are green dorsally, with a series of small white spots on both sides, located on the 2nd & 3rd scale rows from the vertebral row. There is distinct red eye streak on both sides of the head. Ventrally they are pale green, except for the last 25 subcaudals, which are dull reddish brown. The holotype specimen is only 136 mm (5‚Öú inches) in total length, 98 mm (3‚Öû inches) in snout-vent length (SVL), and the tail is 38 mm (1¬Ω inches) long.David, Patrick; Vogel, Gernot (1998). \\"Redescription of Trimeresurus huttoni SMITH, 1949 (Serpentes, Crotalinae), with a Discussion of its Relationships\\". Hamadryad 22 (2): 73-87. (Tropidolaemus huttoni, new combination). Geographic range Tropidolaemus huttoni is found in the Meghamalai Hills in the southern Western Ghats, situated in Theni district of Tamil Nadu, southern India. It is known only from the type locality, which is listed as \\"High Wavy Mountains, Theni district, southern India\\". According to David and Vogel (1998), this is a plateau on the western central edge of the Varushanad Hills, at 1,590 m (5,200 feet) elevation, in Theni district, Tamil Nadu. Biology and natural history Little is known of the biology and natural history of T. huttoni. The original description states that the two juvenile specimens were collected together, both evidently belonging to the same brood. The region was, during Hutton's days, covered by dense tropical rainforests; but is now partly covered by tea plantations.

Quest created and marketed flavours and fragrance concepts and solutions for the fast-moving consumer goods industries. With operations in 31 countries, Quest made ingredients for foods, snacks, beverages, personal care, fine fragrances, and home hygiene products. Quest Flavours and Food Ingredients was headquartered in Naarden, Netherlands; Quest Fragrances was based in Ashford, Kent, UK. Major competitors included Firmenich, Givaudan, International Flavors and Fragrances and Symrise. History Some highlights in the 100-year history of Quest include - 1905 N.V. Chemische Fabriek \\"Naarden\\" is established. It is to become widely known simply as \\"Naarden\\", the name of the nearby ancient fortress town. In English, the name is Chemical Factory Naarden (CFN). The company starts operations with 14 employees at the site of a former sugar beet factory, making glycerine for South Africa (glycerine was used in a wide range of industries, including explosives, paints, food and drinks). The company soon hit financial problems and for the next few years survives by distilling caraway seeds and other materials for essential oils. The manufacture of aromatic chemicals from which essences and perfume compounds emerged - the basis of the future industry on which the company was to flourish and become today's Quest International. 1908 Willem A van Dorp joins as manager of CFN at the age of 26. He and his son - also named W A van Dorp - were to have a huge impact on the future of the company by adopting more modern approaches to chemistry. 1910 CFN exhibited at a Brussels fair with an ornate display case of products. 1914 At the outbreak of the first world war, CFN produced 5,000 tons of glycerine a year that was to be exported to Britain, which took over the existing contract to South Africa because of the war. Holland was officially neutral during the conflict and CFN survived to expand into additional areas - some successful, some not. It linked up with a dye-making concern with disastrous consequences and the company's financial situation in the 1920s became extremely difficult. 1939 The second world war forces production of glycerine at CFN to a trickle and while times are difficult, the factory concentrates of anti-oxidants which are essential for food preservation. Flavourings and vitamin C are also produced (at one stage, staff collected wood from the countryside to keep the factory's boilers going). 1940 CFN's first subsidiary, Naarden-Belgium Ltd, is established. It was the first of an increasing number of subsidiaries to be formed in the post-war years as the company expanded. 1953 W A van Dorp senior retired after having been managing director since 1916. His son, also W A van Dorp, a qualified lawyer who had been joint managing director since 1949, became general managing director. 1955 The 50th anniversary of operations at Naarden is celebrated. A dinner attended by 1,000 employees and their partners is held, as well as a visit to the seaside via 25 buses decorated with flags. 1959 The first Works Council is established. 1963 Between 1959 and 1963, CFN's turnover had risen by 41 per cent. Seventy per cent of this turnover is in foreign markets. 1964 Queen Juliana invites company representatives to her birthday celebrations. At the end of the year, protracted negotiations end successfully with the acquisition of American Flavorex Co Inc of Baltimore and Los Angeles. 1965 The company on its 60th anniversary has 21 subsidiary companies, including 10 in Europe, 5 in Asia and 3 in America. It supplies 160 different fields of industry. A sculpture to mark the anniversary - depicting \\"working together\\" - is unveiled in the town within the Naarden Vesting, or fortress. At this time, for every two employees engaged in production at Naarden, three were in the laboratories, two were in marketing, two were in technical, and three were in administrative. There were about 180 employees at Naarden, compared with 100 in 1955. 1966 CFN's first Corporate Conference is held. It was nicknamed the \\"Vatican Council\\". 1967 Fragrance activities are started in the USA. 1968 Van Leepen & Co is acquired and a subsidiary is launched in Italy. Also in the same year, caffeine production is stopped because of high raw materials costs and Coca-Cola now has its own supplies. This marks a retreat by Naarden from the bulk sector. Flavourings and scents are to become the focus. 1969 An installation for the production of aroma chemicals is commissioned at Naarden. 1970 Mr Van Dorp senior dies. Glycerine distillation ends, marking the completion of the move to scents and flavourings. The first employee shareholding programme is launched. 1972 The partnership structure of the company is changed so that N.V. Chemische Fabriek \\"Naarden\\" becomes a holding company, Naarden International N.V. 1983 Mr van Dorp junior steps down as chairman of the Supervisory Board, ending a long link with the van Dorp family. 1986 The number of employees at Naarden International reaches over 2,500. 1987 Unilever acquires Naarden International and merges it with PPF - Quest International is born. The Q device is created, symbolising the globe and compass. The main production of fragrances is moved to Ashford in the UK. PPF (Proprietary Perfume and Flavours) had previously been formed from an early company PPL (Proprietary Perfumes Limited) having merged with FIL (Food Industries Limited) in Bromborough Port. That company had a long history on South East England having originally moved from Bermondsey in South East London to a new purpose built factory at Ashford which also accommodated another Unilever Company - Batchelors Foods. 1993-1996 A large number of small specialist companies are acquired, strengthening the product and technology portfolio of fragrances, flavourings and food ingredients. 1997 UK-based chemicals company ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) acquires Quest International from Unilever as part of its move to the specialty end of the chemicals spectrum. 2004 Ireland based Kerry Group acquires the Food Ingredient Division 2005 Quest International celebrates its 100th anniversary. 2006 Quest introduces a new corporate identity and branding, relaunching itself as a company that 'creates what captivates' with a global advertising programme using a 'black and white' theme. ICI announces the intended sale of Quest International to Givaudan, with expected completion in Q1 2007. 2007 The acquisition of Quest by Givaudan closed on 2 March 2007.Quest acquisition closure .

Besides its ability to routinely clean algae in aquariums, the halloween hermit crab's festive striped coloration also appeals to enthusiasts; it is considered the most brightly colored hermit crab in normal aquarium use. Characteristics The halloween hermit crab is commonly found along coral substrates in the ocean, along sandy areas surrounding reefs, but not typically on top of the reefs themselves, in shallow (less than ) tropical, coastal waters. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea and Hawaii. It is very similar in appearance to three other species in the same genus: C. tricolor, C. vakovako and C. galzini, only distinguishable by the color of its striae. The halloween hermit crab will grow on average to in length, which is fairly large in comparison to other hermit crabs. It has a noticeably flattened pure white shield, approximately long. It is a nocturnal species, and has been described as \\"conspicuous\\". It lives primarily in empty cone shells, mainly those of snails or tritons. Like other hermit crabs, it wears shells in order to protect itself from predators. Its ocular peduncles and antennae are a solid orange and the antennal flagella are transparent. The corneous has parallel ridges on the palm, with similar ridges on the crabs' dactyls (the movable part of their pincers). The halloween hermit crab can live for up to 10 years. =Coloration= The halloween hermit crab is well known for its distinct and vibrant coloration. It has been described as an unusual hermit crab and the brightest of the hermit crabs typically available, with vividly colored walking legs, a red body, and alternating horizontal bright orange and white bands, giving it the likeness of the festive colors of Halloween. These characteristics make the Halloween hermit crab attractive to aquarists. =Diet= The halloween hermit crab is omnivorous and a scavenger, eating nearly anything that appears in its environment, including small animals. It feeds on live and dead animal material, including filamentous algae and detritus. If a halloween hermit crab's shell is too small, it may attack a snail for a larger shell. The halloween hermit crab can eat quickly. Use in aquariums Aquarium owners may like to use the halloween hermit crab because it is visually unlike other aquarium cleaning crabs. It can eat any left-over food that settles along the bottom, sifts through the sand which aerates the aquarium substrate and is well known to eat cyanobacteria, unsightly brown bacteria, and filamentous green algae efficiently. However, because it can become aggressive towards other tank animals and may even kill fish and other invertebrates, it is wise to feed it meats, such as clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp along with various vegetation. Overall, it can support a healthy aquarium environment.

Most fissionable materials need thermal neutrons, which move more slowly. Fast reactors vs. thermal reactors Fast neutron reactors use fast fission to produce energy, unlike most nuclear reactors. In a conventional reactor, a moderator is needed to slow down the neutrons so that they are more likely to fission atoms. A fast neutron reactor uses fast neutrons, so it does not use a moderator. Moderators may absorb a lot of neutrons in a thermal reactor, and fast fission produces a higher average number of neutrons per fission, so fast reactors have better neutron economy making a plutonium breeder reactor possible. However, a fast neutron reactor must use relatively highly enriched uranium or plutonium so that the neutrons have a better chance of fissioning atoms. Fissionable but not fissile Some atoms, notably uranium-238, do not usually undergo fission when struck by slow neutrons, but do split when struck with neutrons of high enough energy.H.W.B. Skinner, The A B C of nuclear weapons // The New Scientist, 26 February 1959, page 473-475: \\"(3) Dirty H-bombs\\" The fast neutrons produced in a hydrogen bomb by fusion of deuterium and tritium have even higher energy than the fast neutrons produced in a nuclear reactor. This makes it possible to increase the yield of any given fusion weapon by the simple expedient of adding layers of cheap natural (or even depleted) uranium. Fast fission of uranium-238 provides a large part of the explosive yield, and fallout, in many designs of hydrogen bomb. Differences in fission product yield A graph of fission product yield against the mass number of the fission fragments has two pronounced but fairly flat peaks, at around 90 to 100, and 130 to 140. With thermal neutrons, yields of fission products with mass between the peaks, such as 113mCd, 119mSn, 121mSn, 123Sn, 125Sb, 126Sn, and 127Sb are very low. The higher the energy of the state that undergoes nuclear fission, the more likely a symmetric fission is, hence as the neutron energy increases and/or the energy of the fissioning atom increases, the valley between the two peaks becomes more shallow; for instance, the curve of yield against mass for 239Pu has a more shallow valley than that observed for 235U, when the neutrons are thermal neutrons. The curves for the fission of the later actinides tend to make even more shallow valleys. In extreme cases such as 259Fm, only one peak is seen.

Defence of Chencang Following the Tianshui revolts and the Battle of Jieting in early 228, Cao Zhen, the General-in-Chief of Wei, predicted that a future invasion by Wei's rival state Shu Han would come from Chencang (Èô≥ÂÄâ; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi), so he ordered Hao Zhao and Wang Sheng (ÁéãÁîü) to guard Chencang and strengthen its defences.

The odds were drastically against Hao Zhao ‚Äì he had only about 1,000 men to resist the Shu army numbering tens of thousands, with no sign of Wei reinforcements heading towards Chencang. Zhuge Liang then ordered his troops to use an escalade tactic by scaling Chencang's walls with siege ladders. However, Hao Zhao countered by ordering archers to fire flaming arrows at the siege ladders, setting them aflame and burning the soldiers on them. When the enemy used battering rams, Hao Zhao ordered his troops to link rocks and boulders with chains and roll them down the walls to smash the battering rams.(‰∫ÆËá™‰ª•ÊúâÁúæÊï∏Ëê¨ÔºåËÄåÊò≠ÂÖµÊâçÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÂèàÂ∫¶Êù±ÊïëÊú™ËÉΩ‰æøÂà∞Ôºå‰πÉÈÄ≤ÂÖµÊîªÊò≠ÔºåËµ∑Èõ≤Ê¢ØË°ùËªä‰ª•Ëá®Âüé„ÄÇÊò≠ÊñºÊòØ‰ª•ÁÅ´ÁÆ≠ÈÄÜÂ∞ÑÂÖ∂Èõ≤Ê¢ØÔºåÊ¢ØÁÑ∂ÔºåÊ¢Ø‰∏ä‰∫∫ÁöÜÁáíÊ≠ª„ÄÇÊò≠Âèà‰ª•Áπ©ÈÄ£Áü≥Á£®Â£ìÂÖ∂Ë°ùËªäÔºåË°ùËªäÊäò„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 3.

Formerly a parish belonging to the Catholic Church, it was established in 1880 to serve the Polish community in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. It is considered to be the best example of the opulent Polish Cathedral style of architecture west of the Mississippi River. The church is notable for a highly publicized dispute over control of the parish and its assets between the church's lay board of directors and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. In December 2005, Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke declared the parish's board members and its priest, Marek Bozek, excommunicated and announced his intention to disband the parish with the likelihood that the premises would be sold. The parish responded by holding a Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve attended by 1,500-2,000 people. The church and the Archdiocese settled their legal dispute in 2013. The parish continues to be maintained and managed by its parishioners as a not-for-profit corporation, calling itself \\"Catholic\\", but unaffiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Church history In 1878, the Archdiocese of St. Louis authorized the construction of a parish to serve the city's growing Polish Catholic community, which up until then attended St. Patrick's at Sixth and Biddle Streets. In 1880, construction began on St. Stanislaus Kostka. The church was built just north of Downtown St. Louis, in a neighborhood that was home to a large number of Polish immigrants. The original church building was built in Romanesque Revival style. It was originally administered by the Franciscans and was the mother church for three other Polish parishes-St. Casimir (1889), St. Hedwig (1904) and our Lady of Czestochowa (1907).\\"St. Stanislaus\\", Archdiocese of St. Louis Under a land deed signed by Archbishop Peter Kenrick in 1891, the parish property was assigned to a corporation under a pastor and lay board members to be continually appointed by the archbishop. The founding documents are known collectively as the Deed and Charter & Bylaws of 1891. A new larger church, designed by Wessbecher and Hummel was dedicated in September 1892. In 1928, the church was damaged by a fire that destroyed the center dome of the structure, and almost all of the original interior decoration The dome was not rebuilt. In 1969, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, Archbishop of Krak√≥w (later Pope John Paul II), visited the church. The building was listed as a City Landmark in 1976 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The church continued to serve the Polish Catholic community in St. Louis even as the community dispersed from the surrounding neighborhood. By the 1950s it had lost most of its local parishioners but continued to receive ethnic support. By the 1970s, the parish buildings were severely deteriorated. The parishioners undertook a large-scale restoration of the church building and began acquiring land surrounding the church. Later improvements included the construction of a Polish Heritage Center. By 2005, the church assets included of land, and the board of trustees estimated the total value of the parish assets at $9.5 million. Conflict with archdiocese The controversy, involving both the control of the physical and financial assets of the parish and the administrative authority of the archbishop, focused on whether those assets would be controlled by a pastor appointed by the archbishop, which is the current canonical norm in the United States, or by a lay board of directors, a practice known as trusteeism. The controversy began under Cardinal John J. Glennon and continued under the late Cardinal Joseph Ritter and his successors, Archbishop John May, Cardinal Justin Rigali, and Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke. Archbishop Robert James Carlson, endeavored to find an adequate compromise that satisfies canon law and all concerned parties, but the breakaway members rejected his proposal. The current structure of the parish derives from one created in 1891. The parish board took the position that the purpose of Burke's actions was to take control of the assets of the parish primarily for economic reasons. They noted that the parish had sustained and restored itself without financial assistance from the Archdiocese and claimed that Burke intended to close the parish once he had control of it. The archdiocese alleged that the lay board of directors, in the early 1980s, without permission from Archbishop May, changed the original 1891 bylaws, which stipulated that the lay board was to function solely as an advisory body to the pastor and thus under the archbishop (cf. the Plenary Councils of Baltimore). In the bylaws as amended, the authority of the pastor was revoked, putting the lay board in full control of the parish. In response, not long after his appointment, Burke mandated that the structure of the parish once again conform to current canon law norms for the United States. The lay board formally appealed to the Holy See and that appeal was denied. The archdiocese did not dispute that the deed to the church property itself belongs to the parish corporation and not to the archdiocese. What was disputed was the membership of that corporation, and how the members are to be chosen. In interpreting the bylaws on these questions, the District Court ruled against the archdiocese and affirmed St. Stanislaus' ownership of its property and its right to craft bylaws that limit the authority of the Roman Catholic archbishop. In August 2004, Burke removed both priests from the parish and transferred the Polish ministry to St. John the Apostle and Evangelist church across from St. Louis Union Station. When the priests left the parish, they took with them property of the parish, including the hymnals, missals, song books, and parish records. In January 2005 Burke threatened the members of the parish board of directors with an interdict if they did not comply with his instructions by February 4, 2005. On February 10, 2005, the lay board had not complied, and the archbishop issued an interdict against the board members, stating that they \\"knowingly, deliberately and publicly damaged seriously the unity of the Church.\\" As of February 25, 2005, Burke's reorganization plan for parishes in south St. Louis City permanently changed the personal parish for Polish Catholics in St. Louis to the nearby church of St. Agatha, a move to which was completed on July 1, 2005. In December 2005, the lay board announced plans to hire a priest of the Diocese of Springfield- Cape Girardeau, Rev. Marek B. Bozek, whose bishop, John Joseph Leibrecht, immediately suspended him for leaving his post without permission. In response to the action of the board, on December 16, 2005, Burke declared that Bozek and the lay board members, Dr. Joseph Rudawski, John Baras, William Bialczak, Edward Florek, Stanley Novak, and John Robert Zabielski, were guilty of the ecclesiastical crime, or delict, of schism from the Roman Catholic Church, an offense to which is automatically attached the penalty of excommunication. In a letter to Catholics in the Archdiocese, he warned the faithful that they would be risking grave sin if they knowingly attempted to receive sacraments from a priest who is in formal schism. Burke also announced his intention to suppress the parish. Following this announcement, a sizeable crowd attended the first Mass celebrated by the new pastor, on Christmas Eve 2005. On December 29, 2005, Burke canonically suppressed St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, since it was operating independently of the Archdiocese of St. Louis. On May 15, 2008, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a decree rejecting the recourse filed in March 2006 by Rev. Bozek and the other excommunicated board members against the decrees of excommunication. This decision on the part of the Vatican ratified the excommunications on the basis of the commission of schism being \\"evident\\" on the part of the excommunicated board members. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI dismissed Bozek from the clerical state. Subsequent developments Servers at Mass in the church in 2020 The Archdiocese of St. Louis issued the following statement on July 23, 2008: > Mrs. Bernice Krauze, Mr. Stanley Rozanski, and Mr. Robert Zabielski, members > of the previous Board of Directors of Saint Stanislaus Parish Corporation, > met last month (June 10) with Archbishop Raymond L. Burke to be reconciled > fully with the Catholic Church. They are once again in full communion with > the Roman Catholic Church and are no longer under any censure. Edward Florek > was reconciled fully with the Roman Catholic Church in 2008 and is in full > communion. He is no longer under any censure. > Since then, the three have joined other ex-parishioners of the former Saint > Stanislaus Kostka parish in filing a lawsuit against the Saint Stanislaus > Parish Corporation. The lawsuit is asking for the corporation to adhere to > the 1891 Bylaws, to which the parish and the Archdiocese of St. Louis had > agreed. If the lawsuit is successful, the Archdiocese of St. Louis is > prepared to appoint a Catholic priest, Rev. Michael Marchlewski, S.J., to > Saint Stanislaus as administrator. In 2010 the archdiocese made an offer to settle the lawsuit. The offer would have left control of the property and assets in the congregation but brought the parish back into control of the archdiocese. However, there was no guarantee the parish would not be closed in the future. The excommunicated priest, Marek Bozek, whose liberal views had become an issue to conservative Archbishop Burke, would have been required to depart. The settlement offer was rejected 257 to 185. Under Marek Bozek's leadership, the church, in a decaying St. Louis neighborhood, grew by roughly 500 families, despite approximately 200 families leaving since the beginning of the dispute. Bozek's non-orthodox views include allowing priests to marry and permitting women and homosexuals to be ordained. Transmogrification of the issues from property to doctrinal issues has alienated some traditional parish members but attracted other new congregants.\\"Renegade Priest Leads a Split St. Louis Parish\\" article by Malcolm Gay in The New York Times August 13, 2010, accessed August 14, 2010 On March 15, 2012 a St. Louis circuit court judge ruled that control of the church property and assets belonged to St. Stanislaus Parish Corporation, not the archdiocese. Judge Hettenbach wrote in a decision that sided with the parish on all but two of the case's 12 questions \\"The archbishop may own the souls of wayward St. Stanislaus parishioners, but the St. Stanislaus Parish Corporation owns its own property\\". On February 13, 2013, St. Stanislaus Corporation and the Archdiocese of St. Louis issued a joint statement that said: In August 2013, Bishop Wayne Smith of the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri, announced that the diocese and St. Stanislaus had entered into preliminary discussions regarding St. Stanislaus joining the Episcopal Church (United States). It was reported to also be in discussions with the Polish National Catholic Church and other groups regarding possible affiliation. On Friday, August 16, 2019, The Episcopal News Service released the following update in an article by Janis Greenbaum, Director of Communications for the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri. > Bishop Smith has notified the Diocesan Standing Committee, Bishop Mike > Klusmeyer of West Virginia (liaison to the International Old Catholic > Bishops‚Äô Conference), and Presiding Bishop Michael Curry about this possible > union. For the affiliation to be official, Bishop Smith would make an > application to Presiding Bishop Curry on behalf of St. Stanislaus to request > permission for the union.

It is used in a number of separate weapon systems, including the 9K116-1 Bastion missile system (AT-10 Stabber), 9K118 Sheksna (AT-12 Swinger), T-12 antitank gun and the 3UBK12 fired from the BMP-3. The 100 mm projectile entered service in 1981.Angelskiy, R. (2002), p. 111-115 Development The 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) was the first Soviet tube fired anti-tank missile to enter service; however, it was only deployed in limited numbers to front line units. Development work began in the late 1970s on a third generation of guided projectiles that would use laser guidance rather than radio command links. The guidance system was developed by Igor Aristarkhov, and the missile was developed by Petr Komonov. The Bastion was developed firstly as a relatively cheap missile fired from towed MT-12 100 mm smoothbore AT-guns. The 9M117 missile was part of the 3UBK10 round and the whole weapon system was designated 9K116 Kastet. A laser guidance device was seated on a tripod next to the gun. The system was commissioned in 1981. During development of the 9K116 system, it was recognized that it could enhance the long range firepower of the older T-55 and T-62 tanks. The system for the T-55's D-10T 100 mm rifled gun was designated 9K116-1 Bastion (3UBK10-1 round); and for the T-62's U-5TS 115 mm smoothbore gun, 9K116-2 Sheksna (3UBK10-2 round).Angelskiy, R. (2002), p. 117-119 The 9M117 missiles were identical, as in the towed version; however, the 115 mm version had additional guiding rings. They were commissioned in 1983. Then, the 9K116-3 system was developed for the 100 mm rifled gun of the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle, commissioned in 1987. Similar systems, with larger caliber 9M119 Svir missiles, were developed for the 125 mm guns of the T-72 and T-80 tanks. Description The 100 mm round resembles a normal 100 mm anti-tank round, and is loaded and fired in the same fashion. The round uses a reduced explosive charge to launch the projectile out of the barrel of the gun at around 400 to 500 m/s. After leaving the gun barrel, a small cover falls away from the window on the rear of the missile. The rocket motor ignites 1.5 seconds after firing the missile, and it burns for 6 seconds. The projectiles use beam-riding laser guidance. A cone of laser light divided into sectors is projected from the launching tank/vehicle/gun, each sector having a different frequency or modulation. The missile has a small window in the rear with a laser sensor to detect the modulation of the light. Using this modulation, the missile steers itself, maintaining its position in the cone. Laser beam is zoomed during the missile flight so it has the same diameter (about 6 meters) throughout the missile flightpath. The laser beam-riding guidance system is smaller than a radio command one, and cheaper and simpler than semi-active laser guidance. The missile is also not prone to radio or optical jamming. On the other hand, a target has to be tracked by laser sight all the time, and the system can not be reliably used on the move. The missile's flight time to 4,000 meters is approximately 12 seconds. After 26 to 41 seconds, the missile self-destructs.

The Mukhya Upanishads. Kshetra Books. (Reprinted in 2014).Paul Deussen. Sixty Upanishads of the Veda. Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass. . pages 269-273 It is also known as ' Upanishad, and is listed as number 3 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads. The Katha Upanishad consists of two chapters (AdhyƒÅyas), each divided into three sections (Vallis). The first Adhyaya is considered to be of older origin than the second. The Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa ‚Äì the son of Sage Vajasravasa, who meets Yama (the Hindu deity of death). Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Atman (Soul, Self) and moksha (liberation). The chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested, with Buddhism scholars stating it was likely composed after the early Buddhist texts (fifth century BCE),Richard King (1995). Early Advaita VedƒÅnta and Buddhism: the MahƒÅyƒÅna context of the Gau·∏çapƒÅdƒ´ya-kƒÅrikƒÅ. SUNY Press. , page 52 and Hinduism scholars stating it was likely composed before the Buddha, in 800 BCE. The Kathaka Upanishad is an important ancient Sanskrit corpus of the Vedanta sub-schools, and an influential ≈öruti to the diverse schools of Hinduism. It asserts that \\"Atman (Soul, Self) exists\\", teaches the precept \\"seek Self-knowledge which is Highest Bliss\\", and expounds on this premise like the other primary Upanishads of Hinduism. The Upanishad presents ideas that contrast Hinduism with Buddhism's assertion that \\"Soul, Self does not exist\\", and Buddhism's precept that one should seek \\"Emptiness (≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ) which is Highest Bliss\\".Robert Altobello (2009), Meditation from Buddhist, Hindu, and Taoist Perspectives, American University Studies - Series VII, Peter Lang Publishers, , pages 73-101John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: \\"The Buddhist schools reject any ƒÄtman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\\". The detailed teachings of Katha Upanishad have been variously interpreted, as Dvaita (dualistic)Ariel Glucklich (2008), The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective, Oxford University Press, , page 70, Quote: \\"The Upanishadic age was also characterized by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. Monism holds that reality is one ‚Äì Brahman ‚Äì and that all multiplicity (matter, individual souls) is ultimately reducible to that one reality. The Katha Upanishad, a relatively late text of the Black Yajurveda, is more complex. It teaches Brahman, like other Upanishads, but it also states that above the 'unmanifest' (Brahman) stands Purusha, or 'Person'. This claim originated in Samkhya (analysis) philosophy, which split all of reality into two coeternal principles: spirit (purusha) and primordial matrix (prakriti).\\" and as Advaita (non-dualistic).SH Nasr (1989), Knowledge and the Sacred: Revisioning Academic Accountability, State University of New York Press, , page 99, Quote: \\"Emerson was especially inebriated by the message of the Upanishads, whose nondualistic doctrine contained so lucidly in the Katha Upanishad, is reflected in his well known poem Brahma\\".Kathopanishad, in The Katha and Prasna Upanishads with Sri Shankara's Commentary, Translated by SS Sastri, Harvard College Archives, pages 1-3Patrick Olivelle (1996), The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text & Translation, Oxford University Press, , Introduction Chapter It is among the most widely studied Upanishads. Katha Upanishad was translated into Persian in 17th century, copies of which were then translated into Latin and distributed in Europe.Philip Renard (1995), Historical bibliography of Upanishads in translation, Journal of Indian philosophy, vol 23, issue 2, pages 223-246. Other philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer praised it, Edwin Arnold rendered it in verse as \\"The Secret of Death\\", and Ralph Waldo Emerson credited Katha Upanishad for the central story at the end of his essay Immortality, as well as his poem \\"Brahma\\".R White (2010), Schopenhauer and Indian Philosophy, International Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 50, issue 1, pages 57-76 Etymology Katha (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§†) literally means \\"distress\\".KaTha Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany Katha is also the name of a sage, credited as the founder of a branch of the Krishna Yajur-veda, as well as the term for a female pupil or follower of Kathas school of Yajurveda. Paul Deussen notes that the Katha Upanishad uses words that symbolically embed and creatively have multiple meanings. For example, a closely pronounced word Katha (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§•‡§æ) literally means \\"story, legend, conversation, speech, tale\\". All of these related meanings are relevant to the Katha Upanishad. Nachiketa, the boy and a central character in the Katha Upanishad legend, similarly, has closely related words with roots and meanings relevant to the text. Paul Deussen suggests Na k·π£iti and Na aksiyete, which are word plays of and pronounced similar to Nachiketa, means \\"non-decay, or what does not decay\\", a meaning that is relevant to second boon portion of the Nachiketa story. Similarly, Na jiti is another word play and means \\"that which cannot be vanquished\\", which is contextually relevant to the Nachiketa's third boon. Both Whitney and Deussen independently suggest yet another variation to Nachiketa, with etymological roots that is relevant to Katha Upanishad: the word Na-ciketa also means \\"I do not know, or he does not know\\".WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, page 91 Some of these Sanskrit word plays are incorporated within the Upanishad's text. Like Taittiriya Upanishad of Yajurveda, each section of the Katha Upanishad is called a Valli (‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•Ä), which literally means a medicinal vine-like climbing plant that grows independently yet is attached to a main tree. Paul Deussen states that this symbolic terminology is apt and likely reflects the root and nature of the Upanishads in Black Yajur veda, which too is largely independent of the liturgical Yajur Veda, and is attached to the main text.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 217-219 Chronology The chronology of Katha Upanishad is unclear and contested by scholars.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1 All opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Buddhism scholars such as Richard King date Katha Upanishad's composition roughly to the 5th century BCE, chronologically placing it after the first Buddhist Pali canons.Richard King (1995), ƒÄcƒÅrya, Gau·∏çapƒÅda - Early Advaita VedƒÅnta and Buddhism: the MahƒÅyƒÅna context of the Gau·∏çapƒÅdƒ´ya-kƒÅrikƒÅ, SUNY Press, , pages 51-58A.L. Basham in Paul Williams, ed., Buddhism: Buddhist origins and the early history of Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia. Taylor & Francis, 2005, (page 61). Hinduism scholars such as Stephen Phillips note the disagreement between modern scholars. Phillips dates Katha Upanishad as having been composed after Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Isha, Taittiriya, Aitareya and Kena, but before Mundaka, Prasna, Mandukya, Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads, as well as before the earliest Buddhist Pali and Jaina canons. RanadeRD Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy, Chapter 1, pages 13-18 posits a view similar to Phillips, with slightly different ordering, placing Katha's chronological composition in the fourth group of ancient Upanishads along with Mundaka and Svetasvatara. Paul Deussen too considers Katha Upanishad to be a post-prose, yet earlier stage Upanishad composed about the time Kena and Isha Upanishads were, because of the poetic, mathematical metric structure of its hymns.S Sharma (1985), Life in the Upanishads, , pages 17-19 Winternitz considers the Kathaka Upanishad as pre- Buddhist, pre-Jaina literature.M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, Structure The Katha Upanishad has two chapters, each with three sections (valli), thus a total of six sections. The first section has 29 verses, the second section 25 verses, and the third presents 17. The second chapter opens with the fourth section of the Katha Upanishad and has 15 verses, while the fifth valli also has 15 verses. The final section has 17 verses. The first chapter with the first three vallis is considered older, because the third section ends with a structure in Sanskrit that is typically found at closing of other Upanishads, and also because the central ideas are repeated though expanded in the last three sections, that is the second chapter. This, however, does not imply a significant gap between the two chapters, both chapters are considered ancient, and from 1st millennium BCE. The origin of the story of the little boy named Nachiketa, contained in Katha Upanishad is of a much older origin.WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 88- 112 Nachiketa is mentioned in the verses of chapter 3.11 of Taittiriya Brahmana, both as a similar story, and as the name of one of five fire arrangements for rituals, along with Savitra, Caturhotra, Vaisvasrja and Aruna Agni.Radhakrishnan, S. (1994). The Principal Upanishads. New Delhi: HarperCollins Publishers India. p. 593. The style and structure suggests that some of the verses in Katha Upanishad, such as 1.1.8, 1.1.16-1.1.18, 1.1.28 among others, are non-philosophical, do not fit with the rest of the text, and are likely to be later insertion and interpolations., The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages xxi-xxv, and page 5 with footnote 1 Content =The son questions his father - First Valli= The Upanishad opens with the story of Vajasravasa, also called Aruni Auddalaki Gautama,(1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 1 with footnote 1 who gives away all his worldly possessions. However, his son Nachiketa (Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡•á‡§§‡§æ) sees the charitable sacrifice as a farce, because all those worldly things have already been used to exhaustion, and are of no value to the recipients. The cows given away, for example, were so old that they had 'drank-their-last-water' (‡§™‡•Ä‡§§‡•ã‡§¶‡§ï‡§æ‡§É), 'eaten-their-last-grass' (‡§ú‡§ó‡•ç‡§ß‡§§‡•É‡§£‡§æ‡§É), 'don't give milk' (‡§¶‡•Å‡§ó‡•ç‡§ß‡§¶‡•ã‡§π‡§æ‡§É), 'who are barren' (‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É).(1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 1-2 with footnote 3 Concerned, the son asks his father, Nachiketa does not die, but accepts his father's gifting him to Death, by visiting the abode of Yama - the deity of death in the Indian pantheon of deities. Nachiketa arrives, but Yama is not in his abode. Nachiketa as guest goes hungry for three nights, states verse 9 of the first Valli of Katha Upanishad. Yama arrives and is apologetic for this dishonor to the guest, so he offers Nachiketa three wishes.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 277-278 Nachiketa' first wish is that Yama discharge him from the abode of death, back to his family, and that his father be calm, well-disposed, not resentful and same as he was before when he returns. Yama grants the first wish immediately, states verse 1.1.11 of Katha Upanishad. For his second wish, Nachiketa prefaces his request with the statement that heaven is a place where there is no fear, no anxiety, no old age, no hunger, no thirst, no sorrow. He then asks Yama, in verse 1.1.13 of Katha Upanishad to be instructed as to the proper execution of fire ritual that enables a human being to secure heaven. Yama responds by detailing the fire ritual, including how the bricks should be arranged, and how the fire represents the building of the world. Nachiketa remembers what Yama tells him, repeats the ritual, a feat which pleases Yama, and he declares that this fire ritual will thereafter be called the \\"Nachiketa fires\\". Yama adds that along with \\"three Nachiketa fires\\", anyone who respects three bonds (with mother, father and teacher), does three kinds of karma (rituals, studies and charity), and understands the knowledge therein, becomes free of sorrow.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 278-279 Nachiketa then asks for his third wish, asking Yama in verse 1.1.20, about the doubt that human beings have about \\"what happens after a person dies? Does he continue to exist in another form? or not?\\" The remaining verse of first Valli of Katha Upanishad is expression of reluctance by Yama in giving a straight \\"yes or no\\" answer. Yama states that even gods doubt and are uncertain about that question, and urges Nachiketa to pick another wish.(1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 5-6 Nachiketa says that if gods doubt that, then he \\"Yama\\" as deity of death ought to be the only one who knows the answer. Yama offers him all sorts of worldly wealth and pleasures instead, but Nachiketa says human life is short, asks Yama to keep the worldly wealth and pleasures to himself, declares that pompous wealth, lust and pleasures are fleeting and vain, then insists on knowing the nature of Atman (Soul) and sticks to his question, \\"what happens after death?\\"Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 279-281 (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 7 =The theory of good versus dear - Second Valli= Yama teaches Atma vidya to Nachiketa Yama begins his teaching by distinguishing between preya (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø, ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø, dear, pleasant),Search for zreyas and priya spellings under Harvard-Kyoto convention for Sanskrit Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany and shreya (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø, good, beneficial excellence).p. 42, Easwaran (2009), Essence of the Upanishads (see article). Easwaran writes that \\"these alternatives have precise Sanskrit names that have no English equivalent: preya and shreya. Preya is what is pleasant; shreya, what is beneficial. Preya is that which pleases us, that which tickles the ego. Shreya, on the other hand, has no reference to pleasing or displeasing. It simply means what benefits us\\" (p. 42). The verses 1.2.4 through 1.2.6 of Katha Upanishad then characterizes Knowledge/Wisdom as the pursuit of good, and Ignorance/Delusion as the pursuit of pleasant. The verses 1.2.7 through 1.2.11 of Katha Upanishad state Knowledge/Wisdom and the pursuit of good is difficult yet eternal, while Ignorance/Delusion and the pursuit of the pleasant is easy yet transient. Knowledge requires effort, and often not comprehended by man even when he reads it or hears it or by internal argument.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 282-283 The pursuit of Knowledge and the good, can be taught,Note: in later verses, Katha Upanishad clarifies that empirical knowledge can be taught, but spiritual knowledge about Atman can not be instructed, only meditated upon and realized. See verses 1.2.23-1.2.25, Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 286 learnt and thus realized., Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 9 A similar discussion and distinction between the pleasant and the beneficial is found in ancient Greek philosophy, such as in Phaedrus by Plato.S Radhakrishnan (1994 Reprint, 1953), The Principal Upanishads (see article), in discussing this verse, offers a quote from Plato's Phaedrus for comparison: \\"In every one of us there are two ruling and directing principles, whose guidance we follow wherever they may lead; the one being an innate device of pleasure, the other an acquired judgment which aspires after excellence. Now these two principles at one time maintain harmony, while at another they are at feud within us, and now one and now the other obtains mastery\\" (p. 608). =Atman exists, the theory of Yoga and the essence of Vedas - Second Valli= Katha Upanishad, in verses 1.2.12 asserts Atman ‚Äì Soul, Self ‚Äì exists, though it is invisible and full of mystery.Paul Deussen, Kathaka Upanishad in Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 283 It is ancient, and recognizable by Yoga (meditation on one's self), states Katha Upanishad. This is one of the earliest mentions of Yoga in ancient Sanskrit literature, in the context of Self-development and meditation. In verses 1.2.14 through 1.2.22, the Katha Upanishad asserts that the essence of Veda is to make man liberated and free, look past what has happened and what has not happened, free from the past and the future, refocus his attention past Ignorance to Knowledge, to the means of blissful existence beyond joy and sorrow. This is achievable through realization of Atman- Brahman, asserts Katha Upanishad, and this essence is reminded in the Vedas through the word Om (, Aum), state verses 1.2.15-1.2.16.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 284-286 That syllable, Aum, is in Brahman, means Brahman, means the Highest, means the Blissful within. Yama, as the spokesman in the second Valli of the Katha Upanishad asserts that man must not fear anyone, anything, not even death, because the true essence of man, his Atman is neither born nor dies, he is eternal, he is Brahman. These passages have been widely studied, and inspired Emerson among others,Brahma Ralph Waldo Emerson, Poetry Foundation In final verses of the second Valli, the Katha Upanishad asserts that Atman-knowledge, or Self-realization, is not attained by instruction, not arguments nor reasoning from scriptures. It is comprehended by oneself through meditation and introspection. It is not attained by those who do not abstain from misconduct, not those who are restless nor composed, not those whose mind is not calm and tranquil, but only those who live ethically, are composed, tranquil, internally peaceful, search within and examine their own nature.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 285-286 Similar ideas are repeated in the Mundaka Upanishad in chapter 3.2, another classic ancient scripture of Hinduism. =The parable of the chariot - Third Valli= The third Valli of Katha Upanishad presents the parable of the chariot, to highlight how Atman, body, mind, senses and empirical reality relate to a human being.Katha Upanishad - Third Valli The Thirteen Principle Upanishads, Robert Hume (Translator), page 351 The Katha Upanishad asserts that one who does not use his powers of reasoning, whose senses are unruly and mind unbridled, his life drifts in chaos and confusion, his existence entangled in samsara. Those who use their intelligence, have their senses calm and under reason, they live a life of bliss and liberation, which is the highest place of Vishnu. Whitney clarifies that \\"Vishnu\\" appears in Vedas as a form of Sun, and \\"Vishnu's highest place\\" is a Vedic phrase that means \\"zenith\\".WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, page 103 Madhvacharya, the Dvaita Vedanta scholar interprets this term differently, and bases his theistic interpretation of Katha Upanishad by stating that the term refers to the deity Vishnu.BNK Sharma (2008), A History of the Dvaita School of VedƒÅnta and Its Literature, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 8, 160-169 This metaphorical parable of chariot is found in multiple ancient Indian texts, and is called the Ratha Kalpana. A similar simile is found in ancient Greek literature, such as the Parmenides, Xenophon's prologue of Prodikos, and in the Platonic dialogue Phaedrus. =The nature of Atman, need for ethics and the hierarchy of Reality - Third Valli= The Katha Upanishad, in verses 1.3.10 through 1.3.12 presents a hierarchy of Reality from the perspective of a human being. It asserts that Artha (objects, means of life) are above Indriya (senses), that Manas (mind) is above Artha in this hierarchy, above the Manas is Buddhi (intellect, his ability to reason), above the Buddhi is Atman (his Soul, great Self). Beyond the Atman, states Katha Upanishad, is the Avyaktam (unmanifested Reality), and Purusha (cosmic soul) is beyond the Avyaktam, and beyond the Purusha, there is nothing - for it is the goal, for it is the highest road. At the basic level of life, the interaction is between Artha and Indriya (sensory organs); while at the highest level, man becomes aware of and holistically realizes the entire hierarchy. The Soul is hidden in all beings, asserts the Katha Upanishad; it does not show itself, but its awareness is felt by seers with agrya sukshma (subtle, more self-evident conscious, keen thinkers).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 288-289 In verse 1.3.13, Katha Upanishad states that Prajna (conscious man) should heed to the ethical precept of self-examination and self-restraint, restraining his speech and mind by the application of his Buddhi (power to reason). Man should, asserts Katha Upanishad, holistically unify his tempered senses and mind with his intellect, all these with his Atman (Soul, great Self), and unify his \\"great Self\\" with the Self of the rest, the tranquility of Oneness with the Avyaktam and \\"cosmic soul\\". Self (Atman) is soundless, touchless, formless, tasteless, scentless, without beginning, without end, imperishable, beyond great, blissful, and when one reveres one's own Self, he is liberated. Such Self-realization is not easy according to Katha Upanishad, Paul Deussen states that verses 1.3.10 to 1.3.13 of Katha Upanishad is one of the earliest mentions of the elements of Yoga theory, and the recommendation of Yoga as a path to the highest goal of man, that is a life of spiritual freedom and liberation. This theory is significantly expanded upon in the second chapter of Katha Upanishad, particularly in the sixth Valli.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 288, 298-299 =The theory of Atman, Oneness and Plurality - Fourth Valli= The fourth Valli starts by asserting that inner knowledge is that of unity, eternal calmness and spiritual Oneness, while the external knowledge is that of plurality, perishable \\"running around\\" and sensory objects.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 288, 290-292WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 104-106 The Katha Upanishad in fifteen verses of the fourth Valli, as well as those the fifth Valli, explains what is Atman, how it can be known, the nature of Atman, and why it ought to be known. For definition, it deploys an epistemic combination of \\"positive assertions\\" as well as \\"exposition by elimination\\", the latter repeated with,Max Muller (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 15-17 Atman, asserts Katha Upanishad, is the subject of Self-knowledge, the bearer of spiritual reality, that which is all- pervading, inside every being, which unifies all human beings as well as all creatures, the concealed, eternal, immortal, pure bliss. It exists and active when man is in awake-state, it exists and active when man is in dream-state. The empirical reality is the \\"honey\\" for the Atman, with the honey metaphor repeating \\"fruit of numerous karma flowers in the valley of life\\" doctrine found in other Upanishads, such as in the second chapter of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. To know Atman, look inward and introspect; to know objects, look outward and examine, states Katha Upanishad. Everything that changes is not Atman, that which was, is, will be and never changes is Atman. Just like a baby is concealed inside a mother's womb when conceived, Atman is concealed inside every creature, states verse 2.4.8 of Katha Upanishad. Soul is the lord of the past, the lord of the now, and the lord of the future. Soul is eternal, never born, never dies, part of that which existed before the universe was formed from \\"brooding heat\\". Sun rests in it, gods rest in it, all nature rests in it, it is everywhere, it is in everything.This principle is repeated in many Vedic texts such as Atharva Veda in chapter 10.8, and the principle is more ancient than Katha Upanishad; for example, Rigveda states it in hymn 10.121.6; see Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 292 To understand the eternal nature of one's Soul is to feel calmness, inner peace, patience and freedom regardless of the circumstances one is in, affections or threats one faces, praises or insults one is subjected to. Anyone who runs after sensory-impressions, gets lost among them just like water flows randomly after rainfall on mountains, state verses 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 of the Katha Upanishad; and those who know their Soul and act according to its Dharmainner law, ethics, morals, just, right, precepts remain pure like pure water remains pure when poured into pure water.WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 106-107 There is no plurality and separateness between the essence (Atman) of I and others, between the essence of nature and spirit, asserts Katha Upanishad in verses 2.4.10 and 2.4.11. The soul-driven individual ignores the superficial individuality of others, and accepts their essential identity. Paul Deussen suggests that verses 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 posit a nondualistic (Advaita) position, where both Purusha and Prakrti are only Atman. This position contrasts with one of the fundamental premises of the dualistic schools of Hinduism.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 291 Shankara agrees with this interpretation. Ramanuja doesn't and offers a theistic dualism based interpretation instead.Kathakopanishad with Sankara Bhasya and Ranga Ramanuja's Prakasika SS Pathak, in Sanskrit, pages 64-65, 150-151 =Life is highest joy, and what happens after death - Fifth Valli= Katha Upanishad's fifth Valli is an eschatological treatise. It begins by stating that human body is like a Pura (Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞, town, city) with eleven gatesThese are two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, two organs of evacuation/excretion, navel, and Brahmarandhram - the aperture at the top of head through which Atman links with Cosmic Soul. See Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 293 that connect him to the universe. The individual, asserts Katha Upanishad, who understands and reveres this town of eternal, non-changing spirit, is never crooked- minded, is always free.WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 107-108Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 293-295 The Soul dwells in swan, in atmosphere, in man, in Varasad (wide spaces), in eternal law, everywhere in the universe; it is born of water, it is born of kine, it is born of ·πöta (right, truth, ethics, morals, eternal law), it is born of stone (mountains) as the great ·πöta, as ought to be. This Soul is worshipped by all the gods. Body dies, Soul doesn't. In verses 2.5.6 and 2.5.7, the Katha Upanishad discusses what happens to the soul after death, stating a variant of the premise of Karma theory that underlies major Indian religions,Max Muller (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 18-20 The Soul is always awake and active, while one is asleep, shaping wishful dreams. It is one with Brahman. It is everywhere, within and without, it is immortal. This universal, oneness theme is explained by the Katha Upanishad by three similes, which Paul Deussen calls as excellent. Just like one light exists and penetrates the cosmic space, enveloping and clinging to everything and every form individually, the \\"one inner Self\\" of beings exists and dwells in all beings, clings to every form and remains still without, states the Katha Upanishad. Just like one air exists and penetrates the world, enveloping and clinging to everything and every being individually, the \\"one inner Self\\" of beings exists and dwells in all beings, clings to every form and remains still without. Just like the Sun exists and its nature is not contaminated by the impurities seen by the eyes, the \\"one inner Self\\" of beings exists and its nature is pure, never contaminated by the sorrows and blemishes of the external world. Parts of the ideas in these first two similes of Katha Upanishad are of far more ancient origins, and found for example in Book 6, Chapter 47 of Rig veda. That individual is perennially happy, asserts Katha Upanishad, who realizes the Atman is within him, that he himself is the Master, that the inner Self of all beings and his own Self are \\"one form manifold\\", and none other.WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 108-109 Life is spirit, full of joy. Meaning is Atman, full of perennial peace. \\"Truly, this is that\\", once deeply felt and understood by man, is inexpressible highest joy. It is he who realizes this who shines, his splendour shines everything with and by (Anu), the whole world shines by such joy unleashed, such splendour manifested.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 295-296 =The theory of Yoga - Sixth Valli= The sixth Valli continues the discussion of Karma and rebirth theory, sections of which Max Muller states is possibly interpolated and inserted in a later period. The first five verses of the last section of the Upanishad assert that those who do not know or do not understand Atman return to the world of creation, and those who do are free, liberated.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 296-298WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, pages 109-111 Some unaware of Brahman's essence are naturally inclined to fear God and its manifestation such as nature (fire, lightning, sun), state verses 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 of Katha Upanishad. Those who are aware of Brahman's essence, are awakened to the knowledge, fear no one and nothing, become immortal as with Brahman.Max Muller (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 16-22 The Katha Upanishad, in verses 2.6.6 through 2.6.13 recommends a path to Self-knowledge, and this path it calls Yoga.Max Muller (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 22 =Realize you are perfect now and here - Sixth Valli= The Katha Upanishad concludes its philosophical presentation in verses 14-15 of the sixth Valli. The state of perfection, according to the last section of the Upanishad, explains Paul Deussen, consists \\"not in the attainment of a future or yonder world, but it is already just now and here for one who is Self-realized, who knows his Self (Soul) as Brahman (Cosmic Soul)\\". This teaching is also presented in the other ancient scriptures of Hinduism, such as Brihadaranyaka Upanishad's Chapter 4.4.6.WD Whitney, Translation of the Katha-Upanishad, Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 21, page 111-112 The verse 15 of the sixth Valli declares that the Upanishad concludes its teaching therein. Yet, the Valli contains three additional verses in modern era manuscripts. Scholars suggestPaul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 299-300 that these remaining verses 2.6.16 ‚Äì 2.6.18 are possibly modern additions as appendix and have been interpolated, because of the declaration of Upanishad's end in verse 15, and because these additional three verses are structured in prose-like manner, rather than poetic metric-perfection of much of the Katha Upanishad. Reception Charles Johnston has called Katha Upanishad as one of the highest spiritual texts, with layers of metaphors embedded therein. To Johnston, the three nights and three boons in the first Valli of Katha Upanishad, for example, are among the text's many layers, with the three connoting the past, the present and the future.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), pages 149-152 The Irish poet William Butler Yeats dedicated several essays and sonnets to themes in Katha Upanishad and related ancient Upanishads of India.JZ Marsh, The Influence of Hinduism in William Butler Yeats's \\"Meru\\", Yeats Eliot Review , Vol. 22, No. 4 , Winter 2005 George William Russell similarly esteemed the Katha and other Upanishads.Peter Kuch (1986), Yeats and A.E.: \\"the antagonism that unites dear friends\\", Colin Smythe, , pages 19-23A Davenport (1952), WB Yeats and the Upanishads, Review of English Studies, Oxford University Press, Vol. 3, No. 9, pages 55-62 The American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson held Katha Upanishad highly, and wrote several poems and essays paralleling the themes in it.Andrew M. Mclean (1969), Emerson's Brahma as an Expression of Brahman, The New England Quarterly, Vol. 42, No. 1 (Mar., 1969), pages 115-122Frederick I. Carpenter, Immortality from India, American Literature, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Nov., 1929), pp. 233-242 The various themes contained in Katha Upanishad have been subject of many scholarly works. For example, Elizabeth Schiltz has compared \\"the parable of the chariot\\" in Katha Upanishad and Platonic dialogue \\"Phaedrus\\", noting the \\"remarkable similarities give rise to a great many tantalizing historical and literary questions\\", and adding the comment, \\"each provides an image of the self as the chariot, they each offer a complex moral psychology, and point toward an effective justification of the best life\\".Elizabeth A. Schiltz (2006), Two Chariots: The Justification of the Best Life in the \\"Katha Upanishad\\" and Plato's \\"Phaedrus\\", Philosophy East and West, Vol. 56, No. 3 (Jul., 2006), pages 451-468 Radhakrishnan notes that Katha Upanishad's discussion of \\"good versus pleasant\\" is evidence of ethical theories and philosophical longings of ancient human beings in India by 1st millennium BCE, much like those in Greek city states in Europe.S. Radakrishnan, The Ethics of the Bhagavadgita and Kant, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 21, No. 4 (Jul., 1911), pages 465-475 =In popular culture= A verse in the Upanishad inspired the title and the epigraph of W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel The Razor‚Äôs Edge, later adapted, twice, into films of the same title (see articles on 1946 and 1984 films). The epigraph reads, \\"The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.\\" taken from a verse in the Katha-Upanishad ‚Äì 1.3.14.

It comprises the fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the second book of Aitareya Aranyaka, which is one of the four layers of Rig vedic text.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 7‚Äì14 Aitareya Upanishad discusses three philosophical themes: first, that the world and man is the creation of the Atman (Soul, Universal Self); second, the theory that the Atman undergoes threefold birth; third, that Consciousness is the essence of Atman.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 13‚Äì20 Chronology According to a 1998 review by Patrick Olivelle and other scholars, the Aitareya Upanishad was likely composed in a pre-Buddhist period, possibly 6th to 5th century BCE. Discussion Aitareya Upanishad is a primary ancient Upanishad, and is listed as number 8 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads. Considered one of the middle Upanishads, the date of composition is not known but has been estimated by scholars to be sometime around 6th or 5th century BCE.Patrick Olivelle (1998), Upani·π£ads, Oxford University Press, , pages 12‚Äì15 The Aitareya Upanishad is a short prose text, divided into three chapters, containing 33 verses.Max Muller, The Aitareya Upanishad, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, pages xcv-xcviii and 236‚Äì246 =First chapter= In the first chapter of the Aitareya Upanishad, Atman is asserted to have existed alone prior to the creation of the universe. It is this Atman, the Soul or the Inner Self, that is then portrayed as the creator of everything from itself and nothing, through heat. The text states that the Atman created the universe in stages. First came four entities: space, maram (earth, stars), maricih (light-atom) and apas (ur-water, cosmic fluid). After these came into existence, came the cosmic self and eight psyches and principles (speech, in-breathing, sight, hearing, skin/hair, mind, out-breathing, reproductivity). Atman then created eight guardians corresponding to these psyches and principles. Then, asserts Aitareya Upanishad, came the connective principles of hunger and thirst, where everything became interdependent on everything else through the principle of apana (digestion). Thereafter came man, who could not exist without a sense of Self and Soul (Atman). But this sense then began cogitating on itself, saying that \\"I am more than my sensory organs, I am more than my mind, I am more than my reproductive ability\\", and then asked (abridged), Paul Deussen summarizes the first chapter of Aitareya Upanishad as follows, =Second chapter= In the second chapter, Aitareya Upanishad asserts that the Atman in any man is born thrice: first, when a child is born (procreation); second, when the child has been cared for and loved to Selfhood where the child equals the parent; third, when the parent dies and the Atman transmigrates. The overall idea of chapter 2 of Aitareya Upanishad is that it is procreation and nurturing of children that makes a man immortal, and the theory of rebirth, which are the means by which Atman sustainably persists in this universe. =Third Chapter= The third chapter of Aitareya Upanishad discusses the nature of Atman. It declares that consciousness is what defines man, the source of all intellectual and moral theories, all gods, all living beings (man, animals, plants), all that there is. Then the Upanishad asserts that the key to the riddle of the Universe is one's own inner self. To know the universe, know thyself. Become immortal, suggests the Aitareya Upanishad, by being you. Max Muller translates parts of the chapter as follows (abridged), Aitareya Upanishad, like other Upanishads of Hinduism, asserts the existence of Consciousness as Atman, the Self or Brahman. It contains one of the most famous expressions of the Vedanta, \\"Prajnanam Brahma\\" (Knowledge is Brahman/god/divine/holy),Commentary on Aitareya Upanishad Adi Shankara, pages 3‚Äì4 which is one of the MahƒÅvƒÅkyas. Sanskrit commentaries A 1593 CE manuscript page of the Aitareya Upanishad with Adi Shankara's commentary. This Hindu manuscript was preserved by and found in a Jain temple bhandara in Varanasi. Aitareya Upanishad is one of the older Upanishads reviewed and commented upon in their respective Bhasyas by various ancient scholars such as Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya. Adi Shankara, for example, commented on Aitereya Upanishad, clarifying that some of his peer scholars have interpreted the hymns in a way that must be refuted. The first meaning, as follows, is incomplete and incorrect, states Shankara Adi Shankara then reminds the reader that the Aitereya Upanishad must be studied in its context, which starts with and states Atma va idam in hymn 1. It doesn't start with, nor does the text's context, mean that \\"I am alive, thus God\\". Rather, states Shankara, the context is abundantly clear that one must know, \\"Atman exists, I am consciousness, and that self-realization of one's Atman, its Oneness with Universal Soul is the path to liberation and freedom. Know yourself. Worship yourself.\\" Adi Shankara then explains that rituals, sacrifices, merit-karma (worship) does not lead to liberation, the wise do not perform these and rituals such as Agnihotra, they seek Atman and understanding of their own Being and their own Inner Self, and when one has achieved \\"Self-knowledge, full awareness of one's consciousness\\" does one achieve moksha.

Part of it is still used as the local parish church by the Church of Scotland. History The abbey was founded in 1217 by Malcolm I, Mormaer or Earl of Fife, and was first colonised by monks from Kinloss Abbey. Culross may have been chosen to establish an abbey because this was the birthplace of Saint Mungo. It is evident that the abbey was built over the earlier Pictish church supposedly founded by Saint Serf in the 6th century, as witnessed by the presence in the ruined Cistercian church of early medieval carved stones and from a ninth-century reference to a church of St Serf at Culross (Cuileann Ros) in a Gaelic list of the mothers of various saints. The original 13th-century abbey was cruciform in plan, without aisles. By the late 15th century the lay brothers had ceased to be part of the monastery, and the abbey community consisted of only 15 choir-monks. The western half of the monastic cloister range was therefore abandoned, and the nave was demolished around 1500, although it is possible that it was about to be rebuilt at the time of the reformation. The reformation parliament of 1560 outlawed monastic life in Scotland and the monastery was allowed to continue, but was planned to die out naturally with the death of the last monk. In the 1580s the local parish congregation began to worship in the old monastic east end. In 1613 the heart of Edward Bruce, a son of Edward Bruce, 1st Lord Kinloss who built Culross Abbey House, was buried in the kirkyard in a silver casket after he was killed in a duel with Edward Sackville.Lord Stowell, 'Account of the Discovery of the Heart of Lord Edward Bruce at Culross in Perthshire', Archaeologia, vol. 20 (London, 1824), pp. 515-8. In 1633 the east end of the abbey church was legally and completely taken over for use as a parish church, while the adjoining buildings fell into decay. In 1642 the north transept was converted into a tomb house by Sir George Bruce of Carnock. Alabaster carved effigies of him, his wife, and eight children can still be viewed there today. The abbey was restored in 1823, although many original features were removed, including the transept chapels. Another restoration took place in 1905, by Glasgow architect Peter MacGregor Chalmers,http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200244 which reinstated the chapels and left the buildings much as they can be seen today. The eastern parts of the church are still in use for worship, and are generally open to the public. A Ley tunnel is said to exist beneath the abbey, and within is said to sit a man in a golden chair waiting to give valuable treasures to anyone who succeeds in finding him. According to one story, many years ago a blind piper decided to try and upon entering at Newgate with his dog he proceeded to search and could be heard playing his pipes as far as the West Kirk, three quarters of a mile away. Eventually the dog emerged into the daylight, however the piper was never seen, or heard of, again.Beare, Beryl (1996), Scotland. Myths & Legends. Pub. Parragon, Avonmouth. . P. 28. Current use Sir George Bruce monument The remaining ruins of the abbey are now in the care of Historic Scotland. The remaining intact part of the Abbey is used by the Church of Scotland as the local parish church. The church contains stained glass in the main east window by the Edinburgh company of Ballantyne & Son, plus several modern stained glass windows. The Abbey has played host to a number of cultural events, including an inaugural concert by Fife Opera.

It is a West German CCC Film production co-produced with French, Italian, and Yugoslav companies and filmed in 70mm. Financed with roughly , the film was the most expensive Karl May western. Composer Riz Ortolani used a chorus for his film score. It was shot at the Spandau Studios in Berlin and on locationin Croatia including at the Plitvice Lakes National Park. The film's sets were designed by the art director Otto Pischinger.  Plot summary  Killings of innocent ranchers indicate the Apaches have broken the peace treaty. Old Shatterhand, blood brother of the Apache chief Winnetou, finds out that ruthless land grabbers did the killings, hoping to start off a war between the Indians and the settlers, and follows the trail right back to the gates of the cavalry's fort.  Background  After the success of director Harald Reinl's Treasure of Silver Lake (Der Schatz im Silbersee) in 1962 produced by Horst Wendlandt for Rialto Film, his rival Artur Brauner from CCC Film also wanted to have his share in this upcoming series. Since Wendlandt got the rights for the original Karl May novels (although none of his films ever got too close to their respective plots), Brauner only had the chance of making a movie \\"inspired by\\" Karl May, using some of the already known characters portrayed by American Lex Barker as \\"Old Shatterhand\\" and Frenchman Pierre Brice as \\"Winnetou\\". American Guy Madison, who had starred in the television series The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, played one of the bad guys and exotic Israeli Daliah Lavi was one of the \\"damsels in distress\\" before turning to a singing career, as did American Bill Ramsey, the comic part in this movie, already known in Germany for his Schlager music and later jazz songs. One mystery remained from the movie: Today no one remembers who the original singer was of the song \\"Nothing To Say\\" (Die Stunde kam) by saloon singer Rosemarie, played by actress Kitty Mattern.  Box office  In West Germany, it was the second top-grossing film of 1964, selling tickets. In France, it was the 52nd top-grossing film of 1965, selling 1,013,075 tickets. In the Soviet Union, the film sold tickets. This adds up to a total of tickets sold worldwide.

Colin Conrad Adams (born October 13, 1956) is a mathematician primarily working in the areas of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and knot theory. His book, The Knot Book, has been praised for its accessible approach to advanced topics in knot theory. He is currently Francis Christopher Oakley Third Century Professor of Mathematics at Williams College, where he has been since 1985. He writes \\"Mathematically Bent\\", a column of math humor for the Mathematical Intelligencer.  Academic career  Adams received a B.Sc. from MIT in 1978 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1983. His dissertation was entitled \\"Hyperbolic Structures on Link Complements\\" and supervised by James Cannon. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-03. Work Among his earliest contributions is his theorem that the Gieseking manifold is the unique cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold of smallest volume. The proof utilizes horoball-packing arguments. Adams is known for his clever use of such arguments utilizing horoball patterns and his work would be used in the later proof by Chun Cao and G. Robert Meyerhoff that the smallest cusped orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds are precisely the figure-eight knot complement and its sibling manifold. Adams has investigated and defined a variety of geometric invariants of hyperbolic links and hyperbolic 3-manifolds in general. He developed techniques for working with volumes of special classes of hyperbolic links. He proved augmented alternating links, which he defined, were hyperbolic. In addition, he has defined almost alternating and toroidally alternating links. He has often collaborated and published this research with students from SMALL, an undergraduate summer research program at Williams.  Books  * C.

It is located relatively near the Sun, at a distance of about 16 light years, in the constellation Leo. AD Leonis is a main sequence star with a spectral classification of M3.5V. It is a flare star that undergoes random increases in luminosity. Properties AD Leonis is an M-type star with a spectral type M3.5eV, indicating it is a main sequence star that displays emission lines in its spectrum. At a trigonometric distance of , it has an apparent visual magnitude of 9.43. It has about 39‚Äì42% of the Sun's mass ‚Äî above the mass at which a star is fully convective ‚Äî and 39% of the Sun's radius. The projected rotation of this star is only 3 km/s, but it completes a rotation once every 2.24 days. It is a relatively young star with an estimated age of 25‚Äì300 million years, and is considered a member of the young disk population. The variable nature of this star was first observed in 1949 by Katherine C. Gordon and Gerald E. Kron at Lick Observatory. AD Leonis is one of the most active flare stars known, and the emissions from the flares have been detected across the electromagnetic spectrum as high as the X-ray band. The net magnetic flux at the surface is about 3 kG. Besides star spots, about 73% of the surface is covered by magnetically active regions. Examination of the corona in X-ray shows compact loop structures that span up to 30% of the size of the star. The average temperature of the corona is around 6.39 MK. During a 1943 proper motion study by Dirk Reuyl at McCormick Observatory, it was suspected of having a companion. However, a 1968 study by Sarah L. Lippincott at Sproul Observatory was unable to confirm this result. A 1997 search with a near-infrared speckle interferometer failed to detect a companion orbiting 1‚Äì10 AU from the star. In 2001, an optical coronagraph was used to example the star, but no companion was found. There is no sign of variability in its radial velocity, which would otherwise indicate the presence of an unseen companion. This star is orbiting through the Milky Way galaxy with an eccentricity of 0.028 . This carries the star as close as 8.442 kpc from the galactic core, and as far as 8.926 kpc. The orbital inclination carries it as far as 0.121 kpc from the plane of the galaxy. Planetary System In 2019 one candidate planet been detected by the radial velocity method but was refuted in 2020.

The parkland is located at St Peters, sitting along the borders of Alexandria, Newtown and Erskineville. Sydney Park is the third largest park in inner-city Sydney. The park comprises large open recreation spaces with distinctive hills that provide 360 degree views over Sydney, a children's playground, wetlands, a sports oval (Alan Davidson Oval), a children's bicycle track, sculptures, a heritage area featuring the remains of the brickworks that formerly occupied part of the site, and the AIDS Memorial Grove. The former brickworks area of the park is listed on the City of Sydney local government heritage list. Part of the park and its trees are slated to be removed due to the Westconnex transport project. History Prior to British settlement, the north-western part of the present park area would have been a forest of turpentine and ironbark trees, grading down towards the south-eastern area, situated on Botany Sands, which would have been swamp, marsh and heathland associated with the waterway that became known as Shea‚Äôs Creek. The woodland area was first cleared by Thomas Smyth, a marine sergeant with the First Fleet, who planted fruit trees and grain crops. The north-west part of the park is situated over a bed of Wianamatta shale which became a valuable source of brick-making clay. Brick manufacture on the site was a major industry by the 1870s when machine manufacture was introduced. Bricks made here were widely used around Sydney‚Äôs suburbs for more than 100 years and the first batch of machine-made bricks was used for the construction of the Farmers‚Äô Building on the corner of Market Street, Sydney. Josiah Gentle opened the Bedford Brickworks in 1893. In 1933, it was taken over by Austral Bricks, who had a large brickworks in Cowper Street, Marrickville. They operated the site until the brickworks closed in 1970. Their Marrickville site was closed down in 1983. Other parts of the Alexandria site were used for a variety of industrial purposes including manufacturing, warehousing and gas storage. The brickworks are registered on the City of Sydney local government heritage- list. They are also used by homeless people. From 1948 to 1976, the massive clay pits that had been excavated were used as a municipal waste tip. After the closure of the tip, the area was reclaimed by placing layers of soil and building rubble over the refuse dump to create the present parkland profile. Art and heritage Sydney Park features public sculpture including Michael Snape's \\"The Trail\\" 1990 which is displayed on top of the hill in the north- western corner of the park, the corner opposite to St Peters railway station. This corner, where King Street, Newtown turns into the Princes Highway, features the remains of the chimneys and brick kilns from the old brickworks site. These chimneys have been kept as heritage items and are a dominating feature of this area. Sports and recreation The Alan Davidson Oval is located in the northern section of the park. The oval is used for cricket and Australian rules football. It is the home ground of the South Sydney District Cricket Club and Newtown Swans Junior Australian rules football team. The park is also the home of the St Peters Parkrun, a weekly free 5 km run, held every Saturday morning around the bike trails and paths of the park. Culture and events Sydney Park has played an important role in various youth subcultures since its redevelopment - generally without official approval. Throughout the 1990s and to the present day the park is used reasonably regularly for the 'Punks Picnic' - a gathering initially of anarcho-punks from Newtown and neighbouring suburbs. From 1992 to 1994 the park was also used by the Vibe Tribe for a series of free open-air rave parties that formed an important part of the Sydney electronic music scene throughout the 1990s. The last of these Freequency was violently shut down by over 40 riot police. Since then, in an effort to avoid such \\"anti-social behaviour\\" and illegal gatherings, the South Sydney Council (and now City of Sydney Council) has allowed and promoted community arts festivals on the site. In recent years, the park has become home to Sydney's Earthdance event, joining simultaneous dance parties in more than 50 countries to mark the International Day of Peace each September. The park has also become the host for the touring Soundwave Festival having its first show there in 2007 and returning in 2008. Flora and fauna The park area has been extensively replanted with a variety of native trees and shrubs. Stormwater retention ponds constructed in the eastern section of the site have been transformed into wetland habitats, partially recreating the original character of the eastern part of the site, and this has attracted a wide variety of bird and animal life including dusky moorhens, Australian magpies and pelicans. It has become a breeding place for black swans.

The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500 BC to 400 AD, including the Lansdowne Heracles and the Victorious Youth. The UCLA/Getty Master's Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation is housed on this campus. History The entrance to the Getty Villa sets the tone of entering an archaeological dig. In 1954, oil tycoon J. Paul Getty opened a gallery adjacent to his home in Pacific Palisades.Storrie at p. 186. Quickly running out of room, he built a second museum, the Getty Villa, on the property down the hill from the original gallery. The villa design was inspired by the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum and incorporated additional details from several other ancient sites. It was designed by architects Robert E. Langdon, Jr., and Ernest C. Wilson, Jr., in consultation with archeologist Norman Neuerburg.Myrna Oliver, Robert Langdon Jr., 86; Designed 1st Getty Museum, The Los Angeles Times, August 25, 2004Grad student unearths architect‚Äôs drawings for Getty exhibition, USC School of Architecture: School News, July 05, 2013 It opened in 1974,Moltesen at p. 155. but was never visited by Getty, who died in 1976. Following his death, the museum inherited $661 millionLenzner, Robert. The great Getty: the life and loves of J. Paul Getty, richest man in the world.

The museum overcame neighborhood opposition to its new campus plan by agreeing to limit the total size of the development on the Getty Center site.Filler at 215. To meet the museum's total space needs, the museum decided to split between the two locations with the Getty Villa housing the Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. In 1993, the Getty Trust selected the Boston architects Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti to design a renovation of the Getty Villa and its campus. In 1997, portions of the museum's collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities were moved to the Getty Center for display, and the Getty Villa was closed for renovation. The collection was restored during the renovation. In 2004, during the renovation, the museum and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) began holding summer institutes in Turkey, studying the conservation of Middle Eastern Art. Reopened on January 28, 2006, the Getty Villa shows Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities within Roman- inspired architecture and surrounded by Roman-style gardens.Moltesen at 157. The art is arranged by themes, e.g., Gods and Goddesses, Dionysos and the Theater, and Stories of the Trojan War. The new architectural plan surrounding the Villa ‚Äì which was conceived by Machado and Silvetti Associates (who were also responsible for the plans for the renovated museum) ‚Äì is designed to simulate an archaeological dig. Architectural Record has praised their work on the Getty Villa as \\"a near miracle ‚Äì a museum that elicits no smirks from the art world ... a masterful job ... crafting a sophisticated ensemble of buildings, plazas, and landscaping that finally provides a real home for a relic of another time and place.\\" In 2016‚Äì18 the collection was reinstalled in a chronological arrangement emphasizing art-historical themes. There has been controversy surrounding the Greek and Italian governments' claim that objects in the collection were looted and should be repatriated. In 2006, the Getty returned or promised to return four looted objects to Greece: a stele (grave marker), a marble relief, a gold funerary wreath, and a marble statue.Carassava, Anthee. Greeks Hail Getty Museum‚Äôs Pledge to Return Treasures. New York Times, December 12, 2006. Retrieved September 3, 2008. In 2007, the Getty signed an agreement to return 40 looted items to Italy.Povoledo, Elisabetta. Italy and Getty Sign Pact on Artifacts. New York Times, September 26, 2007. Retrieved September 3, 2008.Filler at p. 221‚Äì23. Facility and programs The inner peristyle The Getty Villa hosts live performances in both its indoor auditorium and its outdoor theatre. Indoor play-readings included The Trojan Women, Aristophanes' The Frogs, and Euripides' Helen. Indoor musical performances, which typically relate to art exhibits, included: Musica Angelica, De Organographia, and Songs from the Fifth Age: Sones de M√©xico in Concert. The auditorium also held a public reading of Homer's Iliad. Outdoor performances included Aristophanes' Peace, Aeschylus's Agamemnon, and Sophocles' Elektra. The Getty Villa also hosts visiting exhibitions beyond its own collections. For example, in March 2011 \\"In Search of Biblical Lands\\" was a photographic exhibition which included scenes of the Middle East dating back to the 1840s. The Getty Villa offers special educational programs for children. A special Family Forum gallery offers activities including decorating Greek vases and projecting shadows onto a screen that represents a Greek urn. The room also has polystyrene props from Greek and Roman culture for children to handle and use to cast shadows. The Getty Villa also offers children's guides to the other exhibits.Moltesen at p. 156. The Getty Conservation Institute offers a Master's Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in association with the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. Classes and research are conducted in the museum wing of the ranch house. The program was the first of its kind in the United States. Campus Aerial view of Getty Villa (building with red roof at center right) and surrounding area. The Villa self-identifies with Malibu as it is located just east of the city limits of Malibu in the city of Los Angeles in the community of Pacific Palisades.E.g., Storrie at p. 186; Moltesen at p. 155. The museum complex sits on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, which is about from the entrance to the property. An outdoor entry pavilion is also built into the hill near the 248-car, four story, South Parking garage at the southern end of the Outer Peristyle. To the west of the Museum is a 450-seat outdoor Greek theater where evening performances are staged, named in honor of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman. The theater faces the west side of the Villa and uses its entrance as a stage.Filler at p. 221. To the northwest of the theatre is a three-story, building built into the hill that contains the museum store on the lower level, a cafe on the second level, and a private dining room on the top level.Filler at p. 220 North of the Villa is a indoor 250 seat auditorium. On the hill above the museum are Getty's original private ranch house and the museum wing that Getty added to his home in 1954. They are now used for curatorial offices, meeting rooms and as a library. Although not open to the public, the campus includes J. Paul Getty's grave on the hill behind his ranch house. A 200-car North Parking Garage is behind the ranch complex. The museum building is arranged in a square opening into the Inner Peristyle courtyard. The 2006 museum renovation added 58 windows facing the Inner Peristyle and a retractable skylight over the atrium. It also replaced the terrazzo floors in the galleries and added seismic protection with new steel reinforcing beams and new isolators in the bases of statues and display cases. The museum has of gallery space. Writing in 2008, the architectural critic Calum Storrie described the overall effect: > What the Getty Villa achieves, first by seclusion, then by control of > access, and ultimately through the architecture, is a sense of detachment > from its immediate environment.Storrie at p. 187 =Gardens= There are four different gardens on the grounds of the Getty Villa, planted with plants native to the Mediterranean and known to have been cultivated by the ancient Romans. The largest garden is that of the Outer Peristyle, an exact proportional replica of the one at the Villa dei Papiri. The garden is , with a long pool at the center. Traditional Roman landscaping designs are replicated with manicured bay laurel, boxwood, oleander, and viburnum shrubs. There are rows of date palms lining each of the long sides of the Outer Peristyle garden, while each corner features pomegranate trees surrounded by ornamental plants like acanthus, ivy, hellebore, lavender, and iris. Copies of Roman bronzes excavated at the Villa dei Papiri and elsewhere are scattered throughout the garden. Just west of the Outer Peristyle is the Herb Garden, where traditional herbs sourced from ancient Roman texts are cultivated along with a variety of fruit trees: pomegranate, fig, apricot, apple, citrus, and pear. The garden is surrounded by grapevines, and bounded by an olive grove planted on terraces above the garden. The East Garden is small and secluded, surrounded by laurel and plane trees. Its chief feature is an exact replica of the famous shell and mosaic fountain at the House of the Great Fountain in Pompeii, but there is also a circular fountain at the center of a basin filled with aquatic plants, around which the garden is oriented. The fourth and final garden is that of the Inner Peristyle. Like the Outer Peristyle, a long, narrow, marble lined pool forms the centerpiece of the landscaping; along each side are replicas of bronze female statues from the Villa dei Papiri, modelled to appear as if they are drawing water from the pool. In each corner of the garden is a replica white marble fountain, and there are also several bronze copies of famous Greek sculptures like the Doryphoros and busts of Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and Democritus. Collection Victorious Youth, part of the museum's collection The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500 BC to 400 AD, of which approximately 1,400 are on view. Among the outstanding items is Victorious Youth, one of few life-size Greek bronze statues to have survived to modern times. The Lansdowne Heracles is a Hadrianic Roman sculpture in the manner of Lysippus. The Villa also has jewelry and coin collections and an extensive 20,000 volume library of books covering art from these periods. The Villa also displays the Getty kouros, which the museum lists as \\"Greek, about 530 B.C., or modern forgery\\" because scientific analysis is inconclusive as to whether the marble statue can be dated to Greek times. If genuine, the Getty kouros is one of only twelve remaining intact lifesize kouroi.Robert Bianchi, \\"Saga of The Getty Kouros\\", Archaeology (May/June 1994). The Marbury Hall Zeus is an tall marble statue that was recovered from ruins at Tivoli near Rome. =GettyGuide= Detailed information about the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection at the Getty Villa is provided on \\"GettyGuide\\".

It is associated with the Kaushitaki shakha, but a SƒÅmƒÅnya Upanishad, meaning that it is \\"common\\" to all schools of Vedanta. It was included in Robert Hume's list of 13 Principal Upanishads,Hume, Robert Ernest (1921), The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page xi and lists as number 25 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads. The Kaushitaki Upanishad, also known as Kaushitaki Brahmana Upanishad, is part of the Kaushitaki Aranyaka or the Shankhayana Aranyaka. The Kausitaki Aranyaka comprises 15 chapters and four of these chapters form the Kaushitaki Upanishad. Chronology The chronology of Kaushitaki Upanishad, like other Upanishads, is unclear. It is based on an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1Patrick Olivelle (1996), The Early Upanishads: Annotated Text & Translation, Oxford University Press, , Introduction Chapter Kaushitaki Upanishad was probably composed before the middle of the 1st millennium BCE. RanadeRD Ranade, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy, Chapter 1, page 16, see pages 13-18 for discussion places Kaushitaki chronological composition in the third group of ancient Upanishads, composed about the time of Aitareya and Taittiriya Upanishads. Juan Mascar√≥ posits that Kaushitaki Upanishad was probably composed after Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya and Taittiriya Upanishads, but before all other ancient Principal Upanishads of Hinduism.Juan Mascaro (1965), The Upanishads, Penguin Classics, , page 45 Deussen as well as Winternitz consider the Kaushitaki Upanishad as amongst the most ancient prose style Upanishads, and pre-Buddhist, pre-Jaina literature.S Sharma (1985), Life in the Upanishads, , pages 17-19M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, Ian Whicher dates Kaushitaki Upanishad to about 800 BCE.Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, , page 14 According to a 1998 review by Patrick Olivelle, and other scholars, the Kaushitaki Upanishad was likely composed in a pre-Buddhist period, but after the more ancient Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads, placing the Kaushitaki text between 6th to 5th century BCE. Structure The Kaushitaki Upanishad is part of the Rig veda, but it occupies different chapter numbers in the Veda manuscripts discovered in different parts of India. Three sequences are most common: the Upanishad is chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Kausitaki Aranyaka, or 6, 7, 8, 9 chapters of that Aranyaka, or chapters 1, 7, 8 and 9 in some manuscripts.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 21‚Äì23 Paul Deussen suggests that these different chapter numbers may reflect that Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature were created and incorporated as spiritual knowledge in the pre- existing Aranyaka-layer of Vedic texts, and when this was being done in distant parts of India, the sequencing information was not implemented uniformly. The Kausitaki Upanishad is a prose text, divided into four chapters, containing 6,Some manuscripts number the chapter into 7 verses 15, 9 and 20 verses respectively. There is some evidence that the Kaushitaki Upanishad, in some manuscripts, had nine chapters, but these manuscripts are either lost or yet to be found.Max Muller, , Oxford University Press, pages xcviii to ci Content =First chapter= In the first chapter of the Kausitaki Upanishad, rebirth and transmigration of Atman (Soul) is asserted as existent, and that one's life is affected by karma, and then it asks whether there is liberation and freedom from the cycles of birth and rebirth. Verse 2 of the first chapter states it as follows (abridged), In verse 6 of chapter 1, the Kausitaki Upanishad asserts that a man is the season (nature), sprouts from season, rises from a cradle, reborn through his wife, as splendour. It then states, in a dialogue between Man and Brahman (Universal Soul, Eternal Reality), Edward Cowell translates the above verses that declare the \\"Oneness in Atman and Brahman\\" principle as follows, =Second chapter= In the second chapter of the Kausitaki Upanishad, each life and all lives is declared as Brahman (Universal Soul, Eternal Being). To the extent a person realizes that his being is identical with Brahman , to that extent he is Brahman. He doesn't need to pray, states Kausitaki Upanishad, the one who realizes and understands his true nature as identical with the universe, the Brahman.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 30‚Äì42; To those who don't understand their Atman, they blindly serve their senses and cravings, they worship the without; and in contrast, those who do understand their Atman, their senses serve their Atman, they live holistically. In verse 5 of the second chapter, the Kausitaki Upanishad asserts that \\"external rituals such as Agnihotram offered in the morning and in the evening, must be replaced with inner Agnihotram, the ritual of introspection\\". Paul Deussen states that this chapter reformulates religion, by declaring, \\"religion is supposed not to consist in the observance of the external cult; but that which places the whole life, with every breathe, in its service.\\" It is knowledge that makes one the most beautiful, the most glorious, and the strongest. Not rituals, but knowledge should be one's pursuit. =Third chapter= After asserting Atman (Self, Soul) as personified God in first two chapters, the Kausitaki Upanishad develops the philosophical doctrine of the Atman in the third chapter.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 43‚Äì47; It identifies perception of sense-objects as dependent on sense-organs, which in turn depend on integrative psychological powers of the mind. Then it posits that freedom and liberation comes not from sense-objects, not from sense-organs, not from subjective psychological powers of mind, but that it comes from \\"knowledge and action\\" alone. The one who knows Self, and acts harmoniously with the Self, solemnly exists as the highest God which is that Self (Atman) itself. The chapter invokes deity Indra, personifies him as Atman and reveals him as communicating that he is Life-breath and Atman, and Atman is him and all is One. The chapter presents the metaphysical definition of a human being as Consciousness, Atman, Soul. In verse 3, it develops the foundation for this definition by explaining that speech cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst us who are born without the power of speech (dumb); that sight cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst us who are born without the ability of sight (blind); that hearing cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst us who are born without the ability to hear (deaf); that mind cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst us who are without the power of clear thinking (foolishness); that arms or legs cannot define a human being, because we see human beings midst us who lose their arms or legs (cut in an accident). A being has life-force, which is consciousness. And that which is conscious, has life-force.Kaushitaki Upanishad Edward Cowell (Translator), Asiatic Society of Bengal (1861), pages 161‚Äì163 In many verses of chapter 3, the theme, the proof and the premise is re-asserted by Kaushitaki Upanishad, that \\"Prana is prajna, Prajna is prana\\" (‡§µ‡•à ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§É ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§æ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ ‡§∏ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§É, Life-force is consciousness, consciousness is life-force). In the last verses of chapter 3, the Kaushitaki Upanishad asserts that to really know someone, one must know his soul. Know the soul of the subject, not just superficial objects.

The chapter offers sixteen themes in explaining what Brahman (Atman) is, which overlaps with the twelve found in Chapter 2 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 51‚Äì54 This last chapter of Kausitaki Upanishad states that Brahman and Self are one, there is ultimate unity in the Self, which is the creative, pervasive, supreme and universal in each living being.Kausitaki Upanishad Chapter 4, Verse 20 Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, page 334 Translations The Kaushitaki Upanishad has been translated by many scholars, but the translations vary because the manuscripts used vary.

The Venus effect is a phenomenon in the psychology of perception, named after various paintings of Venus gazing into a mirror, such as Diego Vel√°zquez's Rokeby Venus, Titian's Venus with a Mirror, and Veronese's Venus with a Mirror. Viewers of such paintings assume that Venus is admiring her own reflection in the mirror; however, since the viewer sees her eyes in the mirror, Venus is actually looking at the reflection of the painter. This psychological effect is often used in the cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera. Although the name of the effect refers to a woman, Venus, the effect is more general. The effect is seen with an animal apparently looking at itself in a mirror in The Lady and the Unicorn (French: La Dame √† la licorne) tapestries, where the unicorn appears to be gazing at its own reflection as it kneels on the ground. Bertamini et al. (2010) conducted additional studies and confirmed that the Venus effect also occurs with photographs, and in real life when the person and the mirror are seen in a room.

Pre-divestiture models In the early 1970s, well before the Bell System divestiture, customers in increasing numbers chose to install and use telephones not manufactured by Western Electric, AT&T;'s wholly owned subsidiary. To fulfill the demand, the Bell System decided to offer a series of specialty telephones that could be purchased or leased. The series was called the Design Line telephones. The name did not refer to one particular telephone type; rather Design Line was the collective name given to all the specialty phones, including the Candlestick phone, Country Junction phone, Mickey Mouse phone and others. The phones were among the few that could be purchased in the early 1970s. Western Electric broke tradition, by obtaining housings for some of the sets from other manufacturers or local contractors in Indianapolis. In all cases, Western Electric supplied the internal electrical components of the phones, such as ringer, receiver, transmitter, and induction coils. Early Design Line sets displayed this disclaimer: :\\"The telephone housing is your property. To assure quality of service, all working parts, e.g., dial, cords, and electrical components remain the property and responsibility of the Bell Telephone Company.\\" As a consequence, Bell customers still had to pay a monthly lease fee in order to rent the phone's internal components, which remained the property and responsibility of the local Bell provider. Design Line phones are among the few lines of phones produced by Western Electric that were more renowned for looks than durability. Because the majority of the Design Line phone housings were not made by Western Electric, Bell System standards were less stringent for exterior housings than for the phone's internals. Beginning in around 1980, the Bell System allowed customers to own the entire phone, including internal components. Sets were marked with \\"CS\\" to indicate the phone was entirely customer owned. The arrangement in which Western Electric components were installed into Japanese-made housings ended around the time of divestiture. Character phones, such as the Mickey Mouse phone, were made in China using the Trimline handset, rather than just the receiver with dial in the base. These phones were still sold as a part of the Design Line series. Post-divestiture models In 1985, AT&T; Technologies redesigned its consumer telephone products to be cheaper to build and be more competitive in the marketplace by adding electronic ringers and a redial function. In 1986, they moved telephone production out of the United States. After this time several new Design Line series telephones were marketed and discontinued. One example of a \\"Design Line\\" phone was model 140, marketed in the mid 90s. The phone was similar in size to the 2554 wall phone, but had unique features: *Round buttons *Round receiver/microphone *Switchhook similar in shape to a slice of pie *Desk or wall use The phone also required a handset cord which had a long straight section as the connector to the base was located on the bottom of the phone, and not facing outward on the side. In 2000, Lucent Technologies spun off its consumer telephone division, resulting in the Design Line being redesigned. The basic design was retained, except that the handset was more rectangular in shape, and an \\"AT&T;\\" badge was placed on the outside of the handset. The phone also replaced the traditional 100 series (the 2500 and 2554 telephones) for consumer use, as Lucent kept the phones because of their high demand for business use after spinning off its consumer division.

Also, the service is not subject to a prior claim from another customer and receives the same priority as any other firm service. Conditional firm service is similar to firm service in that it is reserved and has priority over interruptible service. However, it can have restrictions, such as times when it would be curtailed before firm service but after interruptible service. The cost per unit with this service is called a firm rate or uninterruptible rate. The opposite of firm service is non-firm service, also called interruptible service or as-available service. The cost per unit for this service is called a non-firm rate or interruptible rate. The interruptible load is the portion of a utility's load that comes from customers with interruptible service. Firm service cannot be interrupted during adverse conditions, such as periods of high demand. However, firm service may also refer to service that is covered by a long-term contract, such as a year or more. There are extreme cases when firm services may be interrupted, such as emergencies and when system reliability is threatened. Services to homes and small businesses are usually firm. Some businesses that cannot afford interruptions also have firm service. Businesses that can afford to have services interrupted or that can significantly reduce their consumption when notified by the provider can get better rates by having non- firm service. Customers that have non-firm service may have a low level or baseline firm service that is guaranteed so that they do not have to shut down completely. Firm and non-firm service is also available for companies that rent or lease pipeline or electrical transmission capacity. Firm service for natural gas pipelines and electrical transmission lines often include two charges. The first is a reservation charge related to how much capacity the customer reserves. This charge is paid regardless of how much capacity is actually used. The second charge is based on how much capacity is used. Interruptible rates are volumetric, being based only on the volume of gas or electricity delivered.

G. Wodehouse. It was first published in Munsey's Magazine in August 1913, before being published as a book in the UK on 28 August 1913 by Methuen & Co., London, and in the US on 10 January 1914 by W.J. Watt and Company, New York.McIlvaine, E., Sherby, L.S. and Heineman, J.H. (1990) P.G. Wodehouse: A comprehensive bibliography and checklist. New York: James H. Heineman, pp. 25‚Äì26. An earlier version of the story, without the love interest, had appeared as a serial in The Captain between January and March 1913 under the title The Eighteen-Carat Kid; this version was not published in the US until August 1980, when it appeared in a volume entitled The Eighteen-Carat Kid and Other Stories. The Little Nugget was reprinted in the Philadelphia Record on 12 May 1940. Plot summary Mrs Nesta Ford, in her London hotel room, reveals to her new friend Lord Mountry that she hopes to take her son Ogden on a yachting trip proposed by Mountry, despite her ex- husband having won custody of the boy. As Mountry leaves, Cynthia Drassilis arrives with Ogden, whom she has led away from his father's country house. Mrs Ford rewards Cynthia, but soon Mr Ford's secretary, a Mr Minnick, arrives to recover the stolen child. Cynthia tries to bribe his colleague, Mrs Sheridan, but to no avail, as she believes Nesta's influence has spoiled the boy. After they have gone, Nesta reveals to Cynthia Ogden's past as the 'Little Nugget', and the repeated attempts to kidnap him made by US gangsters. Nesta wishes to call in professional help, but Cynthia persuades her she can still do it, with the help of her new fianc√©, a wealthy man called Peter Burns, who she suggests can take up a post at Ogden's new school, posing as a trainee schoolmaster. We meet Peter Burns, and learn that he fell deeply in love, sometime between the ages of 21 and 25, with a Miss Audrey Blake, daughter of an impoverished artist. Though he treated her in a patronising way, they got engaged, but shortly after the death of her father, she ran off and married another man. This event crushed Burns, once a carefree and selfish youth, and after some years of travel he returned to London chastened, and became engaged to Cynthia Drassilis mostly out of sympathy for her plight. When she visits him the day after his proposal, she easily talks him into helping her out in her scheme. He meets school head Mr Abney, and is soon signed up as Classics master at Sanstead House, the school to which Mr Ford plans to send Ogden. At Sanstead, Burns takes up his duties and soon finds his feet with the boys; he also befriends White, the smooth-mannered butler. Ogden Ford arrives a few days later, and a rather shocked Abney requests that Burns discourage his rudeness and smoking. Burns quickly learns that any attempt to kidnap the tempestuous boy will require great skill. Time passes and Ford introduces numerous vices to the school. In the local inn one day, Burns sees a suspicious-looking American; later, he sees White the butler chasing someone away from the school with a pistol. White explains that he is a detective from the Pinkerton agency, hired by Mr Ford to watch over his son. The following day, another American visits the school, a pleasant man claiming to be a friend of Mr Ford, who soon leaves again having toured the place. The next evening, Burns is strolling outside when he hears Ogden scream, and a man runs into him, knocking him down. An excited crowd gathers to discuss the incident, a man found breaking into Ogden's room, when Mrs Sheridan appears, for an appointment with Abeny; Burns quickly sees that she is in fact his former fianc√©e, Audrey. Things are awkward between them at first, but they soon make up. Burns meets the American from the village, who turns out to be Buck MacGinnis, former kidnapper of Ogden, and who thinks Burns is none other than his rival, \\"Smooth\\" Sam Fisher. Burns questions White about these men, and learns that while Buck a common hoodlum, Fisher is an educated and dangerously smooth man. Spending more time with Audrey, he realises his love for her is still strong. One day MacGinnis and his gang raid the school, holding up the masters at gunpoint. MacGinnis takes Burns to search for Ogden, but Burns flees out of the study window. As he is climbing out MacGinnis shoots him, but he makes it to the cover of some bushes. Burns tackles MacGinnis, breaking his leg, and the gang flees without the missing Ogden. Burns frees the rest of the school, and the police are called. Ogden still cannot be found, and a friend is also found to be missing. Burns volunteers to go to London to search for the runaways, and Audrey implores him to search well, saying she will lose her job with Mr Ford if Ogden is not found. We learn that Burns has bribed Ogden to go to London, and arranged to have his valet send the boy to his mother Nesta Ford. Abney the headmaster, sick in bed with a cold, learns that the butler is a detective and sends him on the trip to London with Burns. On the way White reveals that he saw Burns give Ogden his directions, and also that he is in fact none other than Smooth Sam Fisher, proposing to come in with Burns on the presumed kidnapping job. Burns flees to his flat, but learns that Ogden has not arrived there. Fisher arrives having followed Burns, but on learning Ogden is off enjoying London he leaves to seek him. After a day's search, Burns finds the boy at the house of his friend's mother, and brings him back to the school. Fisher also returns, threatening to expose Burns' actions if his identity is revealed. Ogden is moved to a safe room, and guarded; Burns' relationship with Audrey chills after he is reminded he is engaged, and he foils another attempt by Fisher to take the boy. The school term ends, but Mr Ford cannot collet Ogden for a few days, so Abney asks Burns to join Audrey and the butler in guarding him, but Fisher reveals Burns' plot to return Ogden to his mother. Burns leaves in shame, but returns and contacts Audrey to tell her about Fisher. She doesn't trust him, remaining aloof, and he sees MacGinnis is also back in the neighbourhood. He drives Fisher out of the house, and takes guard himself, still without Audrey's faith. Fisher comes back having joined up with MacGinnis, and offers Burns a last chance, which he rejects. With the phone wires cut, Burns tries to sneak Ogden across country, but they are trapped in the loft of the school stables. Ogden, bored of the chase, surrenders himself, and Audrey breaks down in tears, comforted by Burns. Some days later, Burns and Audrey speak of their love, but she insists he stand by his promise to Cynthia. They part, and Cynthia's mother appears with Nesta Ford. Mr Ford also arrives, as does Sam Fisher, who persuades Ford to reunite with his wife and to take Fisher on as Ogden's security guard, in lieu of a ransom. Ford agrees and they leave. Mrs Drassilis reveals that Cynthia has fallen for Lord Mountry, and Burns gives them his blessing, releasing her from the engagement. He heads off after Audrey.

It is located around 5 km to the north of Beirut.  Etymology  The name is originally Greek, ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒÆŒªŒπŒøœÇ ‚Äì from ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒØ(anti) \\"contra\\" and ·º•ŒªŒπŒøœÇ (helios) \\"sun\\" ‚Äì meaning \\"facing the sun\\".  Municipality  The municipality of Antelias - Naqqach is located in the Kaza of Matn in Mount Lebanon, one of the eight mohafazats (governorates) of Lebanon. Antelias - Naqqach is 8 kilometers (4.9712 mi) from Beyrouth (Beirut), the capital of Lebanon. Its elevation is 10 meters (32.81 ft; 10.936 yd) above sea level. Antelias - Naqqach surface stretches for 193 hectares (1.93 km¬≤ - 0.74498 mi¬≤).Municipality of Antelias  Archaeological interest  Antelias is home to the site of Ksar Akil where the region's oldest remains of a human being have been found: a 30,000-year-old man near the caves of Ksar Akil. The skull of the body found was sent the Beirut National Museum and the remains were shipped to the United States for conservation and study.Ksar Akil Cave Those caves are also well coveted by known speleologists who have explored their passageways. Antelias cave was also located east of the town until it was completely destroyed by dynamite in 1964. Discoveries from Antelias are housed at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Antelias is also the site of the St-Elie Church, built in 1895. St-Elie Church holds celebrations on the week of 19 July. A variety of activities are offered to the public such as plays, concerts, a fair and food, sweet stands and fireworks.  Historical interest  Antelias (The St Elie Convent in particular) was the venue for the signature of a historical treaty (in Arabic: Ammiyat Antelias) between several communities in Lebanon to unite against the oppression of the Egyptian occupation and their allies in the mid-19th century, precisely in 1840. The Christian and Druze communities were the main parties in that treaty. The treaty did not however prevent a fierce war between the two parties in 1860 which led to tens of thousands of victims.  Religion  Antelias is the seat of the Catholicos of Cilicia of the Armenian Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia. Its Cathedral of St. Elias is the episcopal see of the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Antelias. Other important religious buildings include the St-Elie Maronite convent with its two churches and the St. Mikhael Greek Orthodox church.  Geography  Antelias is composed of a coastal fertile plain and a hilly region more to the east. There is also a narrower plain on the sides of the Antelias river, which originates from a nearby source (Fawar) and runs east west to discharge in the Mediterranean Sea. Antelias river is highly eutrophied due to the strong urbanization and the harmful effect of the untreated used waters.Environmental Status Of Lebanese Waters Until the early nineties of the last century, the coastal plain of Antelias mostly consisted of open areas planted with orange and banana trees. Very few houses could be seen in the coastal plain. The strips along the Antelias river also used to be planted with orange trees. Due to the vast urbanization since the second half of the last century, most green areas have been removed and replaced by residential and commercial buildings, thus creating a serious environmental impact on the area. Very few if any such green areas still exist. = Strategic position = Antelias is considered the gate to the northern Matn regions. The Matn is one of the most prosperous regions of Lebanon, including a number of factories, commercial malls and important schools. Antelias is situated between Beirut and the city of Jounieh and its coastal highway witnesses a daily rush of traffic. As previously stated, Antelias is the gateway to Bikfaya, Dhour el Chweir, Baskinta and Aintoura, all renowned summer resorts and the Antelias-Bikfaya road is well known to play that linkage role.  Commercial interest  Tenjougian Sports Arena at the Aghpalian-Homenetmen Center, Antelias Antelias holds many renowned malls such as ABC and Le Mall, supermarkets such as Spinneys and Bou Kahlil and movie theaters Cine St Elie, Grands Cinemas and CineMall. Adding to this a street dedicated to banks, that has more than five different banks. Antelias has also a strip that offers a selection of different restaurants offering a variety of cuisines such as Japanese: Yen, Yabani and Tsunami, Lebanese : Petit cafe, Keif and Lebnene, American:Spot and Public, Italian: Pinocchio, Mexican: Carlito's and French: L'escroc.Restaurants Strip in AnteliasRestaurants in Antelias  Touristic interest  The Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral (1940) at the Armenian Catholicossate of Cilicia Antelias is the home to a large Marina and beach front that attracts people from neighbouring and even distant localities. Garden Tower was the first hotel built in Antelias area, in the immediate vicinity of the Catholicosate of Cilicia. Also Antelias has a very famous river that passes through its streets.  Cultural interest  Antelias features an annual Book Fair event sponsored by the Antelias Cultural Movement. The Cultural Movement itself is an organization headquartered in Antelias and it holds periodic events such as political discussions, book reviews, theatrical plays and the like. Antelias is also the home of the Rahbani Brothers who have given so much to the World Music Heritage. Antelias inspired the Rahbanis for so many years. There is also a street dedicated to the Rahbani brothers in Antelias.Rahbani Brothers Street  References  External links * Antelias - Naqqach, Localiban Populated places in the Matn District Armenian communities in Lebanon Christian communities in Lebanon Christian cities in Lebanon ","title":"Antelias"},{"id":"3499796","title":"1999‚Äì2000 in Belgian football"},{"id":"3499800","text":"Sir William Boxall (29 June 1800 ‚Äì 6 December 1879) was an English painter and museum director. Early life and education He was born at Oxford on 29 June 1800, and baptised 29 July at St Michael's Church, Oxford, to Thomas Boxall (d. 1847) and his wife Diana (nee Perrett, d.1841). He had an older sister Anne (1794-1846) and a younger sister Emma (1807-1850). He was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon-on-Thames (now Abingdon School), before entering the Royal Academy Schools in 1819. Career Between 1827 and 1845 he made a number of trips to Italy to study the old masters. Initially hoping to make his name as a history painter, Boxall later had to turn to the more lucrative genre of portraiture. Among his friends were William Wordsworth, whose portrait he painted, the sculptor John Gibson and the painter Sir Edwin Landseer. He was the executor of the will of Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, his predecessor as Director of the National Gallery. Following his appointment in February 1866, as the director of the National Gallery, Boxall practically gave up painting. His directorship lasted eight years, during which he oversaw the construction of Edward Middleton Barry's celebrated eastern extension. In 1869, Boxall negotiated the purchase of Sir Robert Peel's collection of Flemish and Dutch paintings for ¬£7,500. With this purchase the Dutch Golden Age became one of the strengths in the Gallery's holdings. pp. 84‚Äì5 Both of the Gallery's paintings by Michelangelo were bought by Boxall, The Entombment in 1868 and the Manchester Madonna in 1870. The authenticity of the former was called into question by the House of Lords in 1869, but is now generally regarded to be genuine ‚Äì unlike another of Boxall's controversial acquisitions, the \\"Suermondt Rembrandt\\" 7, now attributed to Nicolaes Maes.http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi- bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG75 He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1851 and a full Royal Academician (RA) in 1863..

It is part of Trier-Land, a Verbandsgemeinde.  History  The settlement of Aach dates to the Bronze Age. Later there also was a settlement of the Roman Empire. The current municipality was first mentioned in the year 953 under its Latin name Aquacuum. Despite being situated so close to the city of Trier, it was not part of the Archbishopric of Trier. Belonging to the Benedictine monastery St. Irminen, it was reichsfrei. This prompted many Jews to settle in Aach after they were expelled from Trier in the 16th century. During the time of the Napoleonic Wars Aach was‚Äîaccording to the Treaty of Lun√©ville 1802‚Äîa part of France. After Napoleon's ultimate defeat in 1815 Aach became a part of the new Prussian Rhineland province. Prussia itself became a part of the German Empire in 1871. After World War II Aach became a part of the new (West) German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Aach is known for its \\"Viez\\", the typical hard cider of the region.  Law and government  Aach has a council with sixteen seats. The elections in 2004 brought the CDU twelve seats, the other four went to the free voters' association FWG Aach e. V. In the same elections Mayor Josef Krein (CDU) was voted into office with nearly 74% of the votes. The last elections in 2009 brought the Christian Democrats all sixteen seats. Ralf Kierspel (CDU) was voted with 92,72% as mayor.  Geography  Aach lies about 6 km north of the center of Trier. It is situated in the southern Eifel mountains. Hohensonne is a village located just to the west and is included in the municipality. Aach can be reached via Autobahn A 64 (connecting Trier and Luxembourg) at exit no. 3 about 3.7 km south of Aach. The next railway station is the central station of Trier. Jewish History Jews first settled in Aach in 1589. Their population peaked at 86 in 1850. Most Jews were cattle traders, and were fairly successful. The town's synagogue was inaugurated in 1860. In 1938, the majority of Aach's Jews emigrated. Many who remained, perished in the Holocaust. There is no longer an organized Jewish community in Aach. However, the synagogue and Jewish cemetery (dating back to 1600) still exist.

She was the second Navy ship named for Andrew Sterett. The Sterett was laid down on 2 December 1936 at the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 27 October 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Camilla Ridgely Simpson; and commissioned on 15 August 1939, Lieutenant Commander Atherton Macondray in command. Pre-war years The Sterett departed from Charleston, South Carolina on 28 October 1939 in company with two other newly commissioned destroyers, and , for shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico. She visited Veracruz, Crist√≥bal, Mobile, and Guantanamo Bay before returning to Charleston on 20 December. She underwent post-shakedown overhaul and trials at Charleston until departing on 4 May 1940. Assigned to Destroyer Division 15, Sterett rendezvoused with at Guantanamo Bay, and the two destroyers steamed for San Diego via the Panama Canal. They arrived in San Diego on 23 May; and, for a month, Sterett divided her time between training and plane-guarding . On 24 June, she sailed for Hawaii with Enterprise and five other destroyers, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 July. She operated out of Pearl Harbor for the next 10 months, participating in a number of exercises and patrols. When exited Pearl Harbor on 14 May 1941, the Sterett was in her screen. The warships transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Norfolk on 28 June. Sterett next screened the during the escort carrier's Bermuda shakedown cruise. Sterett concluded 1941 engaged in neutrality patrols with the . World War II After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Sterett steamed from Bermuda with the Wasp and an assortment of cruisers and destroyers to counter possible action by Vichy French ships anchored at Martinique. 1942 The Sterett spent the early months of the war patrolling off the eastern seaboard. In mid-January, she steamed to the Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, to meet Task Force 15 (TF 15) and escort a convoy to Iceland. The convoy was transferred to two British destroyers on 23 January 1942, and she entered Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, on the 26th. The Sterett returned to the United States at New York City on 9 February, and she departed on the 15th to meet the passenger liner off the Boston breakwater and escort her into the harbor. After two trips between Boston and Casco Bay, Maine, the Sterett joined the USS Wasp as part of her escort to duty with the British Home Fleet. The task group entered Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, on 4 April. While the Wasp made her first aerial reinforcement of the embattled Malta, the Sterett operated with the British Fleet out of Scapa Flow. The destroyer was with the Wasp on her second run to Malta, 29 April to 15 May, and after returning to Scapa Flow, she headed for the United States. The task group arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 27 May 1942. On 5 June, the Sterett steamed for San Diego, where she arrived on 19 June. She steamed out again on 1 July and, as a part of Task Force 18, steamed via Tongatapu to the Fiji Islands. She was assigned to Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner's South Pacific Amphibious Expeditionary Force and practiced invasion techniques in the Fiji Islands until 1 August 1942. The Sterett spent the rest of 1942 and all of 1943 supporting the Allied forces as they struggled up the island staircase formed by the Solomon Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago. The Solomons invasion fleet, guarded by three carrier task groups led by the , the Enterprise, and the Wasp, arrived in the Solomons late on 6 August. The 1st Marine Division then landed at Guadalcanal. Meanwhile, the Sterett and the Wasp carrier group zigzagged into a rain squall, successfully dodging an 18-plane raid launched from Rabaul on New Britain Island. For the next three days, the Wasp unit guarded the supply lines to Tulagi. Next, the Sterett steamed east of San Cristobal to screen the USS Long Island while she launched 31 Marine planes for the defense of Guadalcanal. Rejoining the Wasp immediately, the Sterett remained with her until DesDiv 15 was detached on 10 September 1942. For the next month, the Sterett escorted convoys and reinforcements to the Solomon Islands. Following duty escorting the and the to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, and guarding the latter all the way to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, she returned to Guadalcanal accompanying two transports, the and the , loaded with troops and equipment. While the transports unloaded, the Sterett fired on enemy bombers and shore batteries harassing Henderson Field. The Sterett returned to the New Hebrides and, after refueling, put to sea on 31 October to protect still more reinforcements to Guadalcanal. The Sterett covered the establishment of the beachhead and later she joined the and the in a bombardment of Japanese positions near Koli Point. Two days later, she retired to Espiritu Santo. =Naval Battle of Guadalcanal= At Espiritu Santo, the Sterett met another convoy and escorted it to Lunga Point, Guadalcanal. As the troops were landing on the morning of 12 November, the Sterett took up station to meet expected air raids. Just after noon, she received word that a large formation of Japanese planes had been spotted by a coastwatcher on Buin, Papua New Guinea. In less than an hour, the attackers swooped in low against the dark background of Tulagi and Florida Island. The Sterett, directly in the line of the Japanese approach, shot down four torpedo bombers while dodging at least three torpedoes. By 14:50, 32 of the Japanese were downed by antiaircraft fire and American aircraft. That evening, after shepherding the transports east to safety, the Sterett joined the van of the cruiser-destroyer force under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and steamed back through Lengo Channel to intercept Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe's Japanese Navy task force. The Sterett and the other in the van, followed by five cruisers and a rear guard of four more destroyers, passed Lunga Point abeam, increased speed and, upon reaching a point about three miles (6 km) north of Tassafaronga, changed course. As the warships sped toward Savo Island, their radar screens were dotted by echoes from the Japanese ships. The Helena reported first contact at 01:30 on the 13th, and soon all the American ships were receiving reflections from the Japanese ships. The two forces were closing each other at a combined speed in excess of 40 knots (75 km/h). The American warships threaded their way into the Japanese formation, and a deadly crossfire immediately engulfed the Sterett. At 01:50, Admiral Callaghan ordered odd ships in column to open fire to starboard and even ships to engage the enemy to port. the Sterett fired on a cruiser to starboard and, in turn, took a terrific pounding from the Japanese battleship Hiei on her port side. At this point, the battle degenerated into a swirl of individual duels and passing shots. The Sterett turned now to Hiei, launching four torpedoes, and peppering her superstructure with 5-inch shells. The Sterett scored two torpedo hits (although these did not explode, not having time to arm before striking) before a third target crossed her bow. At the appearance of an enemy more her size, the Sterett tore into the destroyer with her guns and launched two torpedoes. Before the Japanese destroyer could fire a single shot at Sterett, she was lifted from the water by the exploding torpedoes and rapidly settled to the floor of \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". By this time, the Sterett had undergone a brutal beating from Hiei and various other enemy ships. Author James D Hornfisher wrote in the book Neptune's Inferno: > The Sterett took eleven direct hits, all on her port side, all above the > waterline, and sustained severe shrapnel damage from many near misses.

At 02:30, with the Japanese retiring toward Savo Island, Sterett, her after guns and starboard torpedo tubes out of commission, began to withdraw. She had difficulty overtaking the rest of her force because of her damaged steering gear and the necessity to reduce speed periodically to control the blaze on her after deck. By dawn, she was back in formation on the starboard quarter of the San Francisco. Before heading for Espiritu Santo on the 13th, she delivered her parting shot by depth-charging a sound contact, possibly the submarine which, about an hour later, would sink the . Sterett arrived at Espiritu Santo on 14 November, underwent emergency repairs, and departed from Espiritu Santo on 18 November, arriving in Noumea, New Caledonia on 20 November. On 24 November, she departed for Pearl Harbour, arriving there on 4 December. She then steamed into San Francisco Bay on 11 December and entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where she remained for two months. Sterett steamed from San Francisco on 10 February 1943, joined the at Pearl Harbor, and together they reached Espiritu Santo on 3 March. Sterett departed Espiritu Santo on 8 March and resumed her original assignment ‚Äì guarding convoys to the Solomons-Bismarcks area and patrolling the area to prevent enemy reinforcements from being moved into the fray. 1943 On 6 August 1943, Sterett was steaming in \\"Ironbottom Sound\\" in the second division of the six- destroyer task group under Commander Frederick Moosbrugger. At 12:00, air reconnaissance reported an enemy force of four destroyers delivering troops and supplies to Kolombangara via Vella Gulf. At dusk, the six Americans passed cautiously through Gizo Strait into Vella Gulf. By midnight, the two divisions were skirting the coast of Kolombangara about two miles (4 km) apart. Radar picked up the Japanese ships heading south at about 30 knots (55 km/h). One division launched eight torpedoes at the Japanese column's port side; then Sterett's division loosed their torpedoes and opened with their guns. Three of the four Japanese destroyers took torpedo hits and received fire from 5-inch guns. , the lone survivor, retreated at high speed to Buin. At Vella Gulf, Sterett and her comrades accounted for three destroyers, over 1,500 sailors and soldiers, and a large portion of the 50 tons of supplies. For the rest of August and throughout September, Sterett occupied herself with patrols in the Solomons. On 8 October, she arrived in Sydney, Australia, escorting the light cruiser . The two warships returned to Espiritu Santo on the 24th. At the beginning of November, she accompanied the assault forces to Bougainville, Solomon Islands; and between 5 and 11 November, she supported the carriers while their planes bombed Japanese ships at Rabaul. She screened the carriers that delivered the 9 December air raid on Nauru Island; then she withdrew to the New Hebrides until 27 December 1943. In the Solomons on the last three days of 1943, the Sterett escorted the to Pearl Harbor and on to the Ellice Islands, arriving at Funafuti on 21 January 1944. Two days afterward, she put to sea with the and the . 1944 From 29 January to 7 March 1944, Sterett operated in the Marianas and Marshalls. On the 29th, her carriers' planes struck Roi and Namur islands of Kwajalein Atoll. Next came the 12 February raid on Truk. Five days later, Sterett covered the flattops during raids on Tinian and Saipan. She departed the Marshalls for the New Hebrides, where she joined the Emirau invasion force. Sterett stopped at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, on 4 April and visited Efate on 7 April during her voyage from Emirau Island to the United States. Sterett stopped at Pearl Harbor on 16 and 17 April and arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on the 29th. She underwent yard work from 24 to 30 April and then moved down the coast on 3 May to San Francisco Bay. Forty-eight hours later, she sailed out for Oahu and reached Pearl Harbor on the 10th. Following 14 days of exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, she sortied with Task Group 12.1 (TG 12.1) for the Marshalls. At Majuro from 30 May, she exited the lagoon with TF 58 on 6 June to screen the support carriers during the invasion of the Marianas. Sterett cruised with the carriers from 11 to 25 June as they launched and recovered wave after wave of planes for strikes on Saipan, Iwo Jima, Guam, and Rota Islands, periodically fending off Japanese aerial retaliation. From 25 June until 7 July, she patrolled the waters around Guam and Rota and bombarded Guam. After covering the carriers during the sweeps over Yap, Palau, and Ulithi, she sailed for Eniwetok en route to Puget Sound. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 10 to 14 August and headed on to Bremerton, Washington, entering the Puget Sound Navy Yard on the 20th. Completing overhaul and trials up and down the west coast, she sailed west on 13 October for the Hawaiian Islands. Sterett sortied from Oahu with Task Unit 16.8.5 (TU 16.8.5) on 19 November and, 12 days later, entered Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands. Two weeks before Christmas 1944, she entered Leyte Gulf in the Philippines for patrol and convoy duty. On the day after Christmas, she started for Mindoro with a supply convoy. Two days later, the Japanese attacked. Early that morning, three kamikazes dove at Sterett's convoy. Antiaircraft fire downed the first, but the second and third succeeded in crashing into merchantmen. Sterett endured the onslaught of the \\"Divine Wind\\" until the task unit was dissolved on New Year's Day 1945. On that date, she returned to San Pedro Bay, claiming the destruction of one plane for herself and assists in eliminating two others. During the next three months, Sterett plied the waters of the South and Central Pacific, primarily engaged in patrol and convoy duty in the Solomons. 1945 On 1 April 1945, she was off Okinawa, serving as a radar picket ship. At Okinawa, Japan hurled a storm of suicide planes at the Navy. Particularly hard-hit were the ships on radar picket duty. On 6 April, the Sterett was sent to accompany her companion ship, the , to Okinawa after that destroyer had been hit by a kamikaze. Three days later, the Sterett suffered the same fate. While at picket station No. 4 northeast of Okinawa, five enemy planes swooped on her, and the LCS-36 and LCS-24. The first was driven off and later downed; the second was shot down by the destroyer's main battery; but the third, though battered by her barrage, pressed home its attack and smashed into the Sterett's starboard side at her waterline. She lost all electrical power, but her 20 millimeter and 40 millimeter guns still managed to bring down the fourth attacker. The destroyer lost steering control and the power to all guns and directors; her communications were out; and her forward fuel tanks were ruptured. However, with the shipboard fires under control, steering control reestablished aft, and emergency communication lines rigged, she moved off to Kerama Retto with the providing antiaircraft cover. Following emergency repairs at Kerama Retto, she screened TU 53.7.1 to Ulithi; and from there, she and the USS Rail (DE-304) steamed to Pearl Harbor. After spending the period from 1 to 10 May at Pearl Harbor, she moved on to Bremerton, Washington, and more extensive repairs.

It was the terminus of the Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway from Liverpool. The station closed in 1952, the building was subsequently used as a bus station and later a supermarket. It is now a hotel. Station history The station opened on 1 September 1884, as the Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway's (SCLER) northern terminus. The line ran from Aintree Central in the northern suburbs of Liverpool. The new line provided passengers with an alternative through route to Liverpool city centre, to that run by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (Southport Chapel Street - Liverpool Exchange). It also provided an alternative route from Southport to Manchester. From the outset the SCLER line was no competition to that of the L&Y;'s more direct coastal route, as the route of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) into Liverpool skirted around the eastern areas of Liverpool, travelling down to Hunts Cross in the south and then back up to Liverpool Central High Level. The line only proving to be relatively popular during the summer months and never really taking off as a commuter route. Its heaviest traffic by far was for a short period in 1941 when the competing L&Y; line had been severed by German bombing in the May Liverpool Blitz. During late 1942 the timetable showed five CLC trains each weekday to Southport of which two started at Manchester (Central). The building itself was a grand affair, fronting directly onto Lord Street. The station had five platforms linked at their ends and by a footbridge. It had been intended by the SCLER to link their tracks to that of that L&Y;'s, providing the CLC with access to the northern suburbs of Southport. This had never been agreed with the LYR, so the provision of the footbridge on this basis, was speculative. The station had a two track engine shed and turntable on the south side of the station yard. It closed on 7 July 1952 and was subsequently demolished. The station first closed in 1917, along with all other stations on the extension line, as a World War I economy measure. It reopened in 1919, until 7 January 1952,Monday 7 January 1952 is the published date of closure, which means the last service ran on Saturday 5 January. when the SCLER was closed to passengers from Aintree Central northwards. The line remained open for public goods traffic until 7 July 1952 at Southport Lord Street, Birkdale Palace and Altcar & Hillhouse stations. Public goods facilities were ended at Woodvale, Lydiate and Sefton & Maghull stations on the same date as passenger services (7 January 1952) and there were never any goods facilities at Ainsdale Beach station to begin with. After 7 July 1952, a siding remained open at Altcar & Hillhouse for private goods facilities until May 1960. The very last passenger train to run on part of the SCLER was a railway enthusiasts' 'special' between Aintree and Altcar & Hillhouse stations on 6 June 1959. Subsequent uses of building After closure Southport Lord Street railway station was taken over by Ribble Buses. The spaces in between the platforms were filled in, but apart from that the interior remained the same. The trainshed remained in use by the bus company until Ribble Buses ceased to operate from the building in the 1990s. The trainshed was later demolished. The frontage on Lord Street was retained and exists today. The clock tower still shows 'SCLER' below the clock itself, making reference to its former role. Morrisons supermarket occupies the space behind the facade. Work began in early 2013 on renovating the building as a six-storey, 101-bedroom Travelodge hotel and restaurant. Having been empty for over 10 years this was the first time a business had taken use of the building since Ribble Buses used it as a bus station. The hotel opened in 2014.

It is a form of scrapbooking that is done using a personal computer, digital or scanned photos and computer graphics software. It is a relatively new form of the traditional print scrapbooking. Digital scrapbooking kits are available to purchase and download at many websites that specialize in the craft. Kits contain graphics and word-art and are usually themed and color-coordinated. They usually consist of a mix of background images and \\"cut out\\" images containing alpha channels. Once a kit has been download to the computer, it can then be used over and over again to make new scrapbook pages (scrapbook layouts) within the software program that one chooses to use, often in combination with the users's own family photographs, scanned keepsakes and other elements scanned on a flatbed scanner. Scanning is usually done at 300dpi, to make the resulting images suitable for print. Kits are sometimes licensed differently from the sort of traditional royalty-free stock of the sort that can be purchased per-item at online stock photography sites. Some kit packs will be wholly royalty-free, but some kit makers may restrict usage to non-commercial work only. Some may specifically forbid the sale of commercial greetings cards and gift tags that may be made with their kits. Licensing may vary from kit to kit, even from the same maker. Some kits include re-colored public domain material. In contrast to stock, creators of digital scrapbooking kits often require a credit or byline to indicate that their image elements have been used in a new creation. Some artistic individuals combine digital scrapbooking with traditional scrapbooking to create what's known as hybrid scrapbooking. Hybrid scrapbooking involves creating layouts on the computer using digital supplies that will then be printed and combined with traditional supplies such as buttons, ribbons and other elements. The traditional scrapbooking market appears to have declined in the USA since 2010, probably due to the recession, and digital scrapbooking (being potentially a much cheaper form of scrapbooking) may have increased accordingly. Digital Scrapbooking can also be done online by uploading photos to a scrapbooking website. Digital scrapbooking software The main software programs that are typically used are Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Elements, paint.net (freeware), Filter Forge, Corel Paintshop Pro, and GIMP. Journaling is done within the software programs to accompany images and to create digital storybooks, or scrapbooks, which are then published in photo books via various popular print-on-demand services, printed and added to traditional scrapbooks, burned to CDs or posted on the Web. Digital scrapbooking supplies Digital scrapbooking supplies are downloaded from the Internet and then stored on a computer or external hardrive, DVD or CD media to be used as needed. There are paid and free digital scrapbooking supplies available. The supplies range from full coordinated kits containing papers, embellishments and ribbons to create unique layout pages, to \\"quick pages\\", flattened files containing page layout templates that have already been designed and only need personal photos added to them to complete the page.

Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 24 February 1917 by Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, and in the United Kingdom in May 1918 by Herbert Jenkins, London.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 31‚Äì31, A20. The story had previously appeared in the US in the Saturday Evening Post between 16 September and 11 November 1916. The novel features Ogden Ford and his mother Nesta, both previously encountered in The Little Nugget (1913). Nesta has remarried, to the diffident, baseball-loving millionaire Mr Peter Pett, and Ogden remains spoilt and obnoxious. The story takes its title from the charismatic character of James \\"Jimmy\\" Crocker, Nesta's nephew and a reforming playboy. 'Jim' is called upon to assist in the kidnapping of Ogden, amongst much confusion involving imposters, crooks, detectives, butlers, aunts etc. ‚Äì all in the name of romance. Plot Financier Peter Pett lives in a New York mansion with his formidable wife, crime novelist Nesta Ford Pett, his step-son, the stout and ill-behaved fourteen-year-old Ogden Ford, and his niece, the strong-willed Ann Chester. Mr Pett sees an article in the New York Sunday Chronicle about Mrs Pett's 21-year-old nephew, James Braithwaite Crocker, a wild young man called \\"Piccadilly Jim\\" who is currently in London but used to work for the Chronicle. Mrs Pett decides the family will go to London to bring Jimmy back and keep him under control in New York. Ann does not like Jimmy, because five years prior, Ann wrote a book of poetry and Jimmy interviewed her about it for the Chronicle, but made a joke of her poems and the interview in his article. Ogden behaves rudely to Mr Pett and Jerry Mitchell, Mr Pett's fitness trainer. Ann suggests to Jerry that they kidnap Ogden and send him to the pet hospital run by Mitchell's friend Smithers, who cures sick dogs with a regimen of a healthy diet and exercise. She believes the same treatment would reform Ogden. In London, Nesta's sister Eugenia, who inherited a fortune from her first husband, and Eugenia's husband Bingley Crocker, who was a penniless actor before marrying Eugenia, reside at their fashionable residence, Drexdale House. Jimmy Crocker is Bingley's son and Eugenia's step-son. Nesta claims Eugenia married beneath her, so Eugenia wants to have Bingley made a lord. Bingley would rather return to America to see baseball games, but Eugenia does not want Bingley to leave England until he has been made a peer. Bingley commits a gaffe by opening the front door for the Pett family, instead of waiting for the butler Bayliss to do so, and covers this up by pretending to be the butler. He and Mr Pett bond over their love of baseball, and Pett says he would gladly hire him. Nesta argues that Jimmy should be sent to New York, though Eugenia dismisses the idea. Jimmy wakes with a hangover, and learns from Bayliss about a newspaper report which shows that Jimmy got into a fight with an influential young man, Lord Percy Whipple. This will delay Eugenia's goal of making Bingley a lord, which upsets Bingley. This makes Jimmy feel guilty about his behaviour. Jimmy decides to go to America to save his father any more trouble, and explains this to him in a letter. He sees the beautiful Ann Chester, who is returning to America along with her family. They do not recognize each other. She clearly dislikes Jimmy Crocker, so he pretends to be Algernon Bayliss, son of the butler Bayliss. Back in New York, Nesta Pett hosts a party, where Jimmy's friend Lord Wisbeach is present, as well as the Pett family's new butler, Skinner, who is actually Bingley Crocker. Lord Wisbeach warns Mrs Pett to safeguard the explosive powder called Partidgite invented by her nephew Willie Partridge. Mitchell is pushed too far by Ogden and hits him, and Nesta Pett fires Mitchell. Jimmy volunteers to take Mitchell's place in Ann's kidnapping scheme for her, and is welcomed into the Pett household under his real name, though he still pretends he is not Jimmy to Ann. He plays along with his father being the butler, and also pretends to recognize Lord Wisbeach, though he realizes the man is an imposter. After Jimmy learns that the imposter, alias Gentleman Jack, is after the Patridgite, the so-called Lord Wisbeach tells Mrs Pett that Jimmy and Skinner are imposters. Mrs Pett hires a tough detective, Miss Trimble. Ogden makes a deal with Jimmy to be kidnapped and receive half the ransom. Jimmy remembers he mocked Ann's poetry, and keeps his identity secret. He confesses his love for her, but she has agreed to marry Lord Wisbeach. Bingley tells Jimmy he came to New York because of his homesickness and Jimmy's letter, and left a note for Eugenia saying it was for a vacation. Jimmy discovers Lord Wisbeach stealing the Partridgite. The thief sets off the powder, but it does nothing, and he flees. Miss Trimble asks questions, and Jimmy reveals the whole truth to everyone. The kidnapping plan fails, though Mr Pett insists to Mrs Pett that Ogden be sent to a boarding school. Eugenia Crocker appears and says that Bingley will soon be made a lord, since Lord Percy Whipple respects Jimmy. Jimmy stays in New York to work for Mr Pett. Ann agrees to bury the past and marry Jimmy.

In his preface to the story in the New York Edition (1907-1909) of his fiction, James says he got one hint for this domestic tragicomedy from a visit to an elderly lady who largely lived in her recollections of an early trip to Europe. James later heard about her aging daughters who had never been to Europe and much regretted the fact. He combined the two suggestions in a clever plot and produced a brilliant, polished gem of short narrative. Plot summary The narrator visits the New England home of an ancient widow, Mrs. Rimmle, and her three aging daughters: Becky, Jane and Maria. Long ago Mrs. Rimmle visited Europe, which was the great event of her life. The daughters would also like to see Europe but their mother falls ill whenever their plans get close to materializing. Finally, family friends take Jane to Europe, where she is too happy ever to return. When the narrator next sees Mrs. Rimmle, she tells him that Jane has died abroad, which is not true, and that Becky will soon be going to Europe. Becky never actually gets away from the family house and finally dies. When he last visits the family, the nearly mummified Mrs. Rimmle tells the narrator that Becky has \\"gone to Europe,\\" a sad euphemism for her death. Major themes  The story is a black comedy variant of James' old \\"international theme\\" of the Old World versus the New. The comedy grows bitter, though, as the witch-like Mrs. Rimmle slowly squeezes the life out of her daughters with her unrelenting psychological dominance. Although one of the daughters escapes Mrs. Rimmle's grasp to enjoy a ripe second youth in Europe, the other two are not so lucky. Mrs. Rimmle has been seen as the embodiment of New England Puritanism in her ability to control her daughters by guilt-tripping them. James ridicules the old woman fairly severely but she is by no means powerless to enforce her will. James was proud of the compression he achieved in this story and the way he dramatized the quiet but intense struggle between the ancient widow and her daughters. The narrative's dark humor only heightens the pathos of thwarted and wasted lives.  Critical evaluation  The story has generally been a favorite of critics for the bittersweet account of each daughter's fate and the suavity of the narrator in relating the sometimes grim details. Although the story wastes little time on local-color description, the entire narrative is imbued with the atmosphere of primitive New England, as personified by the aged Mrs. Rimmle. The domineering widow seems almost as old as the Salem witch trials and brings more than a little of their spirit into the story. In his book-length study of Nathaniel Hawthorne, James noted how adroitly the older novelist used New England's Puritan heritage to deepen and darken his tales. James achieves something of the same effect in \\"Europe\\".

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 23 January 1914 by Methuen & Co., London.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 26‚Äì27, A17. Most of the stories had previously appeared in magazines, generally Strand Magazine in the UK and Cosmopolitan or Collier's Weekly in the United States. Although the book was not published in the US, many of the stories were eventually made available to US readers in The Uncollected Wodehouse (1976) and The Swoop! and Other Stories (1979). It is a miscellaneous collection, not featuring any of Wodehouse's regular characters; most of the stories concern love and romance.  Contents  =\\"The Man Upstairs\\"= * UK: Strand, March 1910 (UK setting) * US: Cosmopolitan, March 1910 (as \\"The Man Up-stairs\\", US setting) ;Plot Annette Brougham, a quick-tempered female composer and music-teacher, is disturbed by a knocking on her ceiling. She visits the flat above to complain, but despite her initial feelings of anger towards him, she soon finds herself drawn to \\"Alan Beverley\\", the modest and charming struggling artist she finds there. Alan invites her to knock on the ceiling whenever she wants to talk to him. Reginald Sellers, another resident of the building, a pompous and self- important painter, criticises Alan's work harshly, and Annette defends him, but regrets her cruelty towards Reginald. The boorish Sellers finds some success with his art, selling several paintings to a Glasgow millionaire named Bates, and continues to lord it over his less high-achieving neighbour. Annette publishes a waltz she has written, and that too begins to sell surprisingly well. She is happy, but disappointed that her friend has yet to sell his work, and upset that Sellers still criticises him. She answers the communal telephone one day, and takes a message from a friend of \\"Beverley\\" who is borrowing his flat, and hears that large quantities of printed music and several bad paintings have been delivered there. She confronts \\"Beverley\\", who reveals that his real name is Bill Bates, a Glasgow millionaire. He has been in love with Annette since he first saw her in the street, and took the flat in her building to be near her, banging on the floor to get her attention; he now wants her to marry him. She berates him for tricking her and treating her like a child, and he counters by revealing that he knows she has bought his one and only painting, a mediocre portrait of a Child and a Cat, through an intermediary. He repeats his proposal of marriage, and she tells him to go away. She hears him pacing around in his room above, and, taking a broom, she bangs three times on her ceiling. =\\"Something to Worry About\\"= * UK: Strand, February 1913 (source for this book) * US: Metropolitan, March 1913 ;Plot Sally Preston, a London girl born and bred, is found to be an aficionado of the movies by her father, who disapproves of such entertainments, and is sent to stay with an aunt at a small, sleepy seaside village in Hampshire. She tells her story to Tom Kitchener, a simple young gardener next door, who promptly falls in love with her. So too do most of the other young men of the village, who begin to visit the house in increasing numbers. Tom, too shy to visit and jealous of the men who do, decides to shower her with gifts; it being autumn and all the flowers gone, all he has to shower with are vegetables, which he proceeds to give generously. Her aunt's husband warns him off, but he rebels, proposes to her awkwardly, and is amazed to find himself accepted. Tom buys her a puppy, and she soon finds herself in trouble with the local constable, for failing to put a collar on the dog. Trying to persuade Tom to take revenge on the man for her, she reveals that she has accepted proposals of marriage from several other local men, in a scheme to force her father to take her back to London, but she is worried by Tom's quiet responses. He takes her along to the first of her other suitors, and fights him. Tom wins, despite the other man's greater size, and Sally is moved. He takes her along to the second, and fights him. Tom wins, despite the other's greater skill; Sally is smitten by Tom. He takes her along to the third, who denounces Sally. Tom tells her she will marry him, and she concurs. The story ends with Sally comparing the day's events with a movie she is fond of. Sally's father appears to be a neighbour of Bowles, also an ex-butler turned landlord in London's Ebury Street. =\\"Deep Waters\\"= * US: Collier's Weekly, 28 May 1910 (reset at Ocean Bay in U.S.) * UK: Strand, June 1910 (source for this book) ;Plot George Barnert Callender, playwright and an excellent swimmer, is at Marvis Bay for the production of his play Fate's Footballs, shortly to be put on there. He is on the pier, dwelling on the play's troubles, particularly its star Arthur Mifflin, when he sees a very attractive girl in the water. Straining to follow her as she swims beneath him, he falls from the pier, and is just about to swim off when she grasps him and begins to drag him to shore. He lets her do this, hoping to form an acquaintanceship, and on the shore they meet and she offers to teach him to swim. They meet again later, and he learns her name is Mary Vaughan, staying at the same hotel as George with an aunt. Next day, the troupe arrive to perform George's play, and Mifflin, full of ideas to promote the piece, heads out on a boat trip with George. Explaining it is a stunt to attract attention to the play, Mifflin upsets the boat, expecting George to drag him to safety. George refuses, however, as it would spoil things with Mary, and makes Mifflin to pretend to be the rescuer. Mary's suspicions are aroused by the repeat rescuing, and recalls having seen George before, swimming strongly at another resort. She is furious with him, but Mifflin explains George's initial gallantry and reluctance to repeat the act, and all is forgiven.

She decides to take advice from Doctor Cupid, who answers questions on Matters of the Heart in the weekly magazine Fireside Chat. Dr Cupid advises her to try to pique her fianc√©. And this is what she does with a bold young American pugilist, known as 'Skipper\\" Shute.

Mr Shute invites Maud to meet him in the White City area of London, but Maud says she already plans to go with Arthur there. After the shop is closed, Arthur brings Maud to the White City, and Maud is still disappointed in Arthur's blithe attitude. There they unexpectedly meet Mr Shute, who succeeds in losing Arthur and finding himself alone with Maud. When he tries to kiss her, Arthur, who has come back, provokes Mr Shute into a fight. He even gives him a blow on the head, causing Mr Shute's silk top hat to fall on the ground. Mr Shute runs after his hat, but, when he comes back with it, ready to show Arthur what a real pugilist is, a very large constable has appeared on the scene, and ask the contestants to stop creating trouble on the street.

Jack tells the silent traveller the following story. Jack and his friend \\"Gentleman\\" Bailey don't want to work, so they live off Gentleman's rich friend Jerry Moore. Jerry, who happens to be hard of hearing, is a bachelor and happy to have them in his house because he admires Gentleman. But soon Jerry introduces them to the girl he is in love with, Jane Tuxton, a tough-looking girl who would definitely have Jack and Gentleman out of the house. Gentleman thinks hopefully that Jane is becoming displeased with Jerry because Jerry is meek. Jerry goes to have supper with Jane and her family, and Jack and Gentleman insist on joining him, to Jane's displeasure. Jerry is also diffident towards Jane's family. Gentleman is pleased, saying that the only way for a man to win over the spirited Jane Tuxton is to be assertive and rude to her family. Jerry worries Jane is thinking badly of him, but Gentleman assures him nothing is wrong, and suggests he flatter Jane's family by asking them for advice, telling him to \\"consult her folks\\". However, at the next supper with Jane's family, Jerry is rude to her family, which results in him winning over Jane. Jack's story ends with Jerry thanking Gentleman for advising him to \\"insult her folks\\". Jack leans on the traveller's table and asks for sympathy, but the traveller says he does not know what he is saying and to write it down if it is important, because he is completely deaf. =\\"Rough-Hew Them How We Will\\"= * UK: Strand, April 1910 (UK Setting) * US: Cosmopolitan, August 1910 (US Setting) ;Plot Paul Boielle is a waiter at Bredin's Parisian Cafe and Restaurant.

Jeanne is a slow worker, and one day Paul finds Jeanne sobbing because their boss, Monsieur Bredin, called her a tortoise. Paul puts an arm part of the way round her waist and talks to her affectionately, but she angrily throws off his hand, saying that he could not support a wife on his salary. She is mollified when he tells her he is planning to sell his masterpiece, \\"The Awakening\\", a woodland scene with a young shepherd stooping to kiss beautiful girl. He assures her it will sell. She tells him in a patronizing way that he might be right. Paul tries unsuccessfully to sell his painting. Bredin gives Jeanne a compliment and taps her under the chin, which enrages Paul. He throws bread rolls at Bredin, who fires Paul. He expects Jeanne to be touched by his heroism, but she is upset with him for losing his job. Later, Paul is depressed and thinks he should kill himself. He goes into the street planning to get hit by a car but the car stops, and the driver, a young man, steps out and comforts Paul. Paul tells him his problems, and the young man invites him to come along to his hotel. The next morning, the young man examines the painting, and says the stooping man in the picture would be perfect for advertisements for braces (US: suspenders), specifically Galloway's Tried and Proven, of which he is general manager. He buys it and hires Paul as an advertising artist. Paul happily embraces the young man. That afternoon, Paul has lunch at the cafe. Bredin tries to have Constable Thomas Parsons remove him, saying Paul has no money to lunch there, but Paul reveals this is not the case.

Priaulx is dependent on his uncle, proprietor of the prestigious Hotel Jules Priaulx. His uncle decides he should earn his living as a cashier at the hotel. Priaulx hates working there. He is especially annoyed by an American woman's cat, named Alexander, since the American frequently exhibits the cat to him. One day Priaulx loses his temper and throws the cat. His uncle fires him, but leaves him with some money. Priaulx decides to plead for his job back. He returns to the hotel and engages a room. At night, Priaulx hears a voice saying \\"Move and I shoot!\\" and shouts for assistance. Hotel officials run up, and they all see the voice is coming from a parrot. The parrot's owner is a beautiful and kind lady, Marion Henderson, with whom Priaulx falls in love. He befriends her rich father, who invites him to visit them in London. By complimenting the hotel, Priaulx convinces his uncle to provide enough money for a trip to London. In London, Priaulx has a rival, Captain Bassett. Bassett purchases the cat Alexander for Marion. Priaulx opens the parrot's cage, hoping the cat will attack the parrot and so lose Marion's favour. (The original narrator disapproves of this plan, thinking it unfair to the parrot.) Later, Mr Henderson says that he found the cat looking startled while the parrot was telling him not to move or he would shoot, so no fight occurred. Priaulx next steals the cat, and tries to have it brought to the Cats' House and have it destroyed, but that doesn't happen and Bassett finds the cat there. Priaulx's name is on the box the cat was sent in. Marion chucks Priaulx and marries Captain Bassett. Priaulx adds that his uncle got him a job as an assistant to a man of letters. Priaulx still holds this post, and must now assist in writing a History of the Cat in Ancient Egypt. =\\"Ruth in Exile\\"= * UK: Strand, July 1912 (source for this book) * US: Ainslee's, August 1912 (slightly rewritten with American characters in France) ;Plot In France, Ruth Warden is the unhappy secretary of pawnbroker Monsieur Gandinot. She lives in Roville-sur-Mer with her father, Eugene Warden, because Mr Warden pestered a brother-in-law for loans and agreed to leave England in return for an allowance. Gandinot, a kind man with a funny-looking appearance, is sympathetic, though Ruth's father is oblivious that she is not happy. On the Promenade des Anglais, a fight breaks out between Mr Warden's dog and other dogs. A rich-looking, gregarious young man, George Vince, breaks up the fight. He flirts with Ruth, whom he has seen before, and says he hopes to marry her, though she is unreceptive. Mr Warden, hoping for a rich son-in-law, invites George to spend time with them. Ruth comes to find George interesting, but is still cool towards him. George says they would make a good pair because they are both spirited and would enjoy quarreling. He shows her a clever sketch he drew of her, which Ruth appreciates, though she does not say so. At the pawn shop, Ruth, who assumed George is rich, is surprised to overhear George pawning a silver cigarette case. It occurs to her that was prejudiced against George because she does not want to marry for money, especially since her father wants her to marry a rich man. That barrier is now gone and she loves George. She tells her father that George is poor, and Mr Warden is appalled. Thinking of George's apparent financial difficulties, Ruth starts sobbing, just as George appears with chocolates for her. He rushes to her side, and after Mr Warden states what Ruth overheard, George explains that he went to the pawn shop to study Gandinot. George's father, of Vince's Stores, wants ideas for children's toys, and George found inspiration in Gandinot's amusing appearance. Mr Warden is appeased. Later, Ruth asks George not to use Gandinot's image, since he has been kind to her, and George agrees. He confesses that, despite what he said about quarreling, he will always do what she asks, and hopes that will not make things too dull for her. =\\"Archibald's Benefit\\"= * UK: Pearson's, July 1909 (as \\"Reginald's Record Knock\\", similar story with cricket setting) * US: Collier's Weekly, 19 March 1910 (source for this book; first Wodehouse golf story) ;Plot The unnamed narrator, a competent golfer, explains that Archibald Mealing is an enthusiastic but untalented golfer who nonetheless won a championship, and tells the following story. Archibald belongs to the Cape Pleasant Club. The members, who live in New York but play in New Jersey, are easygoing and avoid quick-moving, serious golfers. The club secretary, chartered accountant McCay, congratulates Archie on his engagement to Margaret Milsom. McCay tells fellow member Sigsbee that he fears Miss Milsom will be disappointed by Archie's performance at their upcoming competition. McCay suggests they give Archie a benefit and let him win. The other participants will agree since everyone likes Archie. Sigsbee reminds him about Gossett, an unpopular member and serious golfer who won't agree, and suggests they upset Gossett's nerves so he will play badly. Margaret's mother has a low opinion of Archie. Stuyvesant, Margaret's brother, listens sympathetically to Mrs Milsom complain, in return for a sort of allowance. Margaret seems very poetic and soulful, and Archie, with difficulty, reads poetry to impress her. At the tournament, Archie is pleased to find himself doing well. The final round is scheduled for Thursday. Archie is sure Gossett will defeat him quickly so he arranges with Margaret to see her Thursday afternoon. Thursday comes, and Sigsbee offers to caddie for Gossett. Gossett is doing well when a telegraph boy approaches with a message for him, though Sigsbee refuses to give it to Gossett, claiming that Gossett must focus on the game. Gossett, a Wall Street broker, is worried about the message and starts playing badly. The telegraph boy returns with more telegrams for Gossett, which Sigsbee refuses to give to him. Archibald is doing comparatively well, and though he too becomes anxious when he sees he is late for his rendezvous with Margaret, he manages to win. Immediately Gossett reads the telegrams. All seven say: \\"Good luck. Hope you win. McCay.\\" Archibald rushes to see Margaret, and claims he is late because he had an accident. However, Stuyvesant saw Archibald that morning and says this is not true. Archibald admits he was playing golf, and Margaret says he should have told her. She enjoys playing golf, and was afraid to tell Archibald because he seemed so spiritual and poetic. She had pretended to like poetry for Archibald. Archibald explains he did the same for her. Despite Mrs Milsom's disapproval, Archibald cheerfully talks with Margaret about golf and his victory. =\\"The Man, the Maid and the Miasma\\"= * UK: Grand, February 1910 (source for this book) * US: Cosmopolitan, June 1910 (set in U.S.) ;Plot In London, Master Roland Bean, the supercilious, disapproving Miasma, wants his job as office-boy back after being fired by Robert Ferguson. Bean waits in the outer office, and Ferguson lingers at his desk, not wishing to face Bean again. Eventually, Ferguson tries to rush out past Bean, but it is twenty minutes after seven, and the porter locked up the building at seven. Bean starts trying to persuade Ferguson to reconsider his dismissal. Ferguson dashes from the room and up the stairs, where he sees a light coming from Mr Blaythwayt's office. Inside, however, is only Mr Blaythwayt's secretary, a girl whom Ferguson used to have a relationship with. Their parting eighteen months prior had been unpleasant. Ferguson informs her they are locked in. She is prepared for such an event, and has cake and cocoa ready. Ferguson proudly insists he doesn't want cake or cocoa, though this is untrue, and he fears hunger will soon overcome his pride. Ferguson explains he is avoiding Bean, who is too disapproving, and she points out that Ferguson was disapproving of her when she wanted to go on the stage, which led to their separation. They argue, and she goes to bring Bean to the room. Ferguson flees to his office. Time passes and Ferguson becomes hungry enough to grovel to her. But at that moment, she comes with cake and cocoa, having been annoyed too much by Bean. She and Ferguson express sympathy for each other. Ferguson acknowledges he judged her for going on the stage, and has now become less judgmental. She too has changed, since she is now more humble. Bean appears, and at his suggestion, Ferguson telephones the police to help them out of the building. Ferguson thinks it must be four in the morning, but Bean reveals it is only half past ten. Ferguson asks the girl to supper. Later, she asks what Ferguson will do regarding Bean, and says that they wouldn't have reunited if not for him. Ferguson decides he will get Bean a job with a firm in Edinburgh, far away from London. =\\"The Good Angel\\"= * UK: Strand, February 1910 (UK Setting) * US: Cosmopolitan, February 1910 (as \\"The Matrimonial Sweepstakes\\") (US Setting) The US version \\"The Matrimonial Sweepstakes\\" features the first appearance in print of the name of Lord Emsworth. ;Plot Martin Rossiter is staying at the country home of his friends Mr and Mrs Keith. He has long been in love with their daughter Elsa Keith. He happily spends time with her until a rival appears in the form of the poet Aubrey Barstowe. The Keiths' dignified butler Keggs advises Martin not to try to stop Elsa from listening to Barstowe read poetry. He claims that she is spirited and would stick to Barstowe if opposed, but she will tire of his poetry eventually if Martin does not interfere. Keggs has a financial interest in the matter. For some years, a matrimonial sweepstake has been held in the servant's hall at each house party, with the names of the gentlemen in the party being placed in a hat and drawn. If Elsa gets engaged to a member of the party, the pool goes to the drawer of the name. The money remains in the pool if she does not get engaged, so the pool has become considerably large. This time, Keggs drew Martin's name. When Elsa and Barstowe go for a drive the next day, Keggs bribes the chauffeur to have car trouble and leave them stranded for a while, so Elsa will have to listen to Barstowe read more poetry. Martin disapproves of Keggs's underhanded scheming, but Keggs says he hopes Martin will come to look on him as his good angel. Despite listening to several poems after the car trouble, Elsa still likes Barstowe's poetry. The next day, Elsa and Barstowe are missing, and it is late in the day when Keggs finally says that they may have visited the island on a nearby lake and somehow got marooned there. Elsa and Barstowe are rescued. Two nights and a day pass. Barstowe goes to London, and Elsa is thankful. She hates Barstowe's poetry after hearing much of it on the island. She now prefers Martin. =\\"Pots o' Money\\"= * UK: Strand, December 1911 (source for this book) * US: Metropolitan, February 1912 (set in U.S.) ;Plot Owen Bentley, employee of the London and Suburban Bank, wishes to marry Audrey Sheppherd, but her father has forbidden it because Owen does not have enough money. Mr Sheppherd prohibits Audrey from seeing Owen again, so Owen and Audrey talk frequently on the telephone. Owen wants to make money but does not know how. He once hoped to find success dramatizing a sentimental novel called White Roses by Edith Butler. He sent her his dramatization, but never heard back from her. Over the telephone, Audrey tells Owen that a dramatized version of White Roses is running at the Piccadilly Theatre. Audrey thinks Edith Butler stole Owen's work. Owen finds it hard to believe that an author of sentimental novels would do such a thing. Audrey urges him to see the play and find out. Before doing so, Owen enjoys his annual holiday in the Shropshire village where he spent his boyhood, at the house of an old acquaintance Mr Dorman. Owen has his fortune told by Dorman's mother. Mrs Dorman sees \\"pots o' money\\" in Owen's future, and also predicts that Mr Prosser, a temperamental, black-bearded writer of sociology books also staying with Mr Dorman, will get engaged and marry within the year, though Prosser strongly disagrees. Back at the bank, Owen forgets to stamp some envelopes. Prosser comes to the bank to complain that Vera Delane, his new fianc√©e, has had to pay for unstamped envelopes. Owen is thrilled that Prosser is engaged, since his own fortune may become true. Prosser is sorry for being temperamental before and invites Owen to dinner after Owen goes to the theatre. At Audrey's insistence, Owen finally sees the play, and discovers that it is his dramatization. He later tells Prosser about it and asks for his advice. Prosser reveals that Edith Butler is his pseudonym, and he did not know who wrote the dramatization, which had no name on it. The play has not been successful in London, but has been very successful in America, so Owen will receive pots o' money. =\\"Out of School\\"= * US: Ainslee's, September 1909 (considerably shorter version set in U.S.) * UK: Strand, October 1910 (source for this book) ;Plot Before telling the following story, the narrator states that James Datchett should not have done what he did, but notes that there were extenuating circumstances. James wants to be an author, but is reliant on his uncle Frederick Knott, who made his fortune keeping sheep in Western Australia and wants James to do the same. A compromise is reached that James will work as an assistant master at Harrow House, a private school run by Mr Blatherwick. If James can hold onto the job, he can remain in England and write in his spare time, but if he fails, he will be sent away to work in Australia. James is excited to learn that the editor of the Universal Magazine accepted his short story, and in his elation, gives a brotherly kiss to Violet, a friendly housemaid. The narrator says that this was wrong, though Violet was not bothered since in her life kissing is a normal form of greeting. A young foreigner named Adolf, who works cheaply for the school for the opportunity to learn English, saw James kiss Violet. He is able to use this information to blackmail James into giving him private English lessons, since James is afraid of being sent to Australia to keep sheep if he loses his job. Adolf attempts to make James give him additional night classes, which pushes James too far, and he kicks Adolf. Adolf leaves and James fears he will lose his job. Meanwhile, Mr Blatherwick receives good news. His wife's brother, who until now just borrowed money from Blatherwick, recommended the school to a friend who is paying for his three sons to attend the school. Blatherwick is pleasantly surprised, and caught up in his joy, he gives Violet a fatherly kiss, just as James walks in. James does not say anything about it, to Blatherwick's relief. The following day, Blatherwick tells James he dismissed Adolf, who had tried to get James fired by telling Blatherwick a story about James kissing Violet. James will get to keep his job and stay in England. =\\"Three From Dunsterville\\"= * UK: Strand, August 1911 (source for this book) * US: Pictorial Review, August 1912 (slightly longer version; characters originally from Illinois) ;Plot Mary Hill recently came to New York from the small town of Dunsterville, Canada.

Joe used to be shy and stare adoringly at Mary from afar, but has been changed by New York. He is now confident, better-looking, and uninterested in Mary. Mary is indignant that Joe, who used to worship her, now only treats her like an insignificant employee. Eddy, on the other hand, is friendly and supportive. Joe tells Mary that Eddy is crooked, but Mary does not believe him. She catches Joe giving her a look of adoration, which surprises her since she thought his feelings had changed. At lunch, Eddy offers to pay Mary for a copy of one of Joe's letters. She is shocked that Eddy really is dishonest. Joe appears, and claims to have accidentally sent Eddy a letter meant for someone else, though Joe actually did this on purpose so that Eddy would try to make a deal with Mary. Eddy quickly leaves. Joe explains that Eddy was hoping to obtain profitable information about John Longwood, who occasionally informs Joe about his activity on the market a day or so in advance. Joe confesses to Mary that, though he has been changed by New York in other ways, he still loves her, and had only been pretending that his feelings had changed. He recalls that Mary didn't care about him in the old days, but she smiles at him and tells him that New York has changed her, too. =\\"The Tuppenny Millionaire\\"= * UK: Strand, October 1912 ;Plot George Albert Balmer inherits a thousand pounds.

Eight wins, but the croupier does not award George, so for Julia's sake, George takes the two louis he thought he won and flees. He is chased by a crowd, but they slow each other down and he escapes. A day later, he finds Julia and holds out the two louis for her, telling the older lady with Julia that he met her at the casino. The older lady, who is really Lady Julia, is displeased and leaves. The girl is Lady Julia's companion, and just lost her job, since she had promised Lady Julia not to go to the casino without her. George is sorry, though she says she had actually wanted to leave the job, but didn't have the nerve. She wants to join her brother in Canada. George asks her to marry him and go to Canada with him. She puts her hand in his and looks at him affectionately. She then asks what his name is. =\\"Ahead of Schedule\\"= * UK: Grand, November 1910 (source for this book) * US: Collier's Weekly, 28 January 1911 (set in New York) ;Plot Rollo Finch asks his valet James Wilson if he has ever been in love, and Wilson says yes, though it came to nothing. Rollo tells Wilson he must have gone about it the wrong way, because he did not use the system that Rollo has thought of: First week, look at her; second week, write her letters; third week, give her flowers; fourth week, buy her presents; fifth week, give her lunches and suppers; sixth week, propose. Wilson says that things are done much more simply in the village where he is from, but Rollo claims you need a better system in London. Rollo has an American millionaire uncle, Andrew Galloway, of Galloway's Tried and Proven, a well-known brand of braces. Mr Galloway was disappointed in love many years prior, so Rollo expects Galloway will not marry and Rollo will someday inherit his uncle's money. Rollo, who is in the third week of his schedule, asks Wilson to buy flowers and deliver them with a note to Marguerite Parker, a chorus girl at the Duke of Cornwall's Theatre. Rollo dines with his uncle, who is unusually cheerful. Mr Galloway hopes to marry a chorus girl who shares his passion for food. The girl is Marguerite Parker, to Rollo's surprise. Galloway plans to propose within a week. To beat his uncle, Rollo reluctantly abandons his schedule. He buys gifts for Marguerite and sends them, with an invitation for supper at a hotel, to the theatre. He waits forty-five minutes at the hotel, though Marguerite never appears. Rollo bitterly returns to his flat, and finds Wilson there chatting with Marguerite. Wilson married her that morning. She missed Rollo's invitation because she had the day off to get married, but thanks Rollo for the flowers. She was the girl Wilson had once loved and lost. They talked things over and reconciled when he delivered Rollo's flowers to her. It occurs to Rollo that now his rich uncle will not marry. He happily congratulates the couple and celebrates with them. He tells Mrs Wilson that he sent some wedding presents to her. =\\"Sir Agravaine\\"= * US: Collier's Weekly, 29 June 1912 * UK: Pearson's, December 1912 (source for this book) The story parodies legends of the knights of King Arthur and stars Sir Agravaine, though the character in the story differs greatly from the Arthurian character. ;Plot The narrator states that the following story is based on an old blackletter manuscript he found in a friend's ancestral castle, though the narrator has touched up the text a little. Sir Agravaine the Dolorous is intelligent, but unattractive, short, and weaker than the other knights. He is aware of his shortcomings and has a melancholy attitude, which is why he is called the Dolorous. A damsel named Yvonne comes seeking a knight to rid her home of a dragon. She is plain- looking and the knights are reluctant to help her, except Sir Agravaine, who finds her beautiful. Agravaine volunteers to help her, though he doubts he can defeat a dragon. Yvonne leads him to her father's castle. Her father, Earl Dorm of the Hills, welcomes Agravaine and is oddly unconcerned about the dragon. Later, Yvonne tells Agravaine to flee, but then Earl Dorm suddenly locks Agravaine in a room. The earl argues with Yvonne, who loves Agravaine and opposes what the earl has planned, though Agravaine does not hear this. He thinks he has been kidnapped for ransom, which fortunately means the dragon was fictitious. Agravaine is rich and not worried about paying ransom. A couple of days pass, and two brutish henchmen bring him food but tell him nothing. The guards both love the same kitchen maid and Yvonne tells each that the maid prefers the other. The henchmen argue and kill each other. Yvonne frees Agravaine and tells him to flee, explaining that he was kidnapped so that he would eventually marry Yvonne. Her father has married off his other daughters by calling in knights on false pretenses. Yvonne believes Agravaine will not return her feelings. However, Agravaine does, and they embrace. Six months later, Agravaine consults a Wise Man in the forest. He asks the man how his wife can possibly find him handsome, and how she can think herself plain when he finds her so beautiful. The Wise Man explains that true love takes no account of looks, and insists on needlessly explaining this at length, though Agravaine gets the idea and hurriedly leaves. =\\"The Goal-Keeper and the Plutocrat\\"= * US: Collier's Weekly, 24 September 1910 (as \\"The Pitcher and the Plutocrat\\", similar story in a baseball context) * UK: Strand, January 1912 (source for this book; soccer background) ;Plot Isabel Rackstraw and the Hon. Clarence Tresillian fall in love and get engaged at a charity bazaar. Clarence goes home and finds his parents distressed. His father, Lord Runnymede, laments that he has lost his veto, and blames the wealthy radical politician Daniel Rackstraw, Isabel's father. Clarence's mother, Lady Runnymede, is upset that the family's income has been diminished because her father lost money speculating on wheat. Clarence will have to get a job. He decides to become a footballer. Isabel's father won't allow them to get married since Clarence is an idle son of an earl. Several times in the story, the narrator wishes to describe characters in greater detail but is unable due to editorial concerns about brevity. Clarence is a skilled goal-keeper and, under the name of Jones, gets signed on by a football club, Houndsditch Wednesday. Mr Rackstraw is a fan of football and watches their matches, along with Isabel. Rackstraw's football collection rivals that of Jacob Dodson, of Manchester. Dodson covets a historic pair of boots in Rackstraw's collection, while Rackstraw wants an important ball owned by Dodson. Houndsditch Wednesday does well with Clarence. The Final will be between Houndsditch Wednesday, supported by Rackstraw, and Manchester United, supported by Dodson. Clarence develops mumps, and is unable to play. Manchester United wins easily. Rackstraw is certain that Houndsditch Wednesday would have won with \\"Jones\\", and to prove this, arranges with Dodson to have the two clubs pay again in a private game. Rackstraw bets his prized boots against Dodson's ball on the outcome. Clarence recovers but refuses to play unless Rackstraw consents to him marrying Isabel. Rackstraw is impressed by this threat and not only agrees but also hires Clarence as a partner in his business. Clarence reveals his true name and reminds Rackstraw he is an earl's son, but Rackstraw is now willing to put politics aside. The narrator, determined to describe the family's future despite concerns about brevity, shows that four years later, Clarence is working with Rackstraw, who won the ball from Dodson, and Isabel and Clarence have a young son. =\\"In Alcala\\"= * US: People's Magazine, November 1909 * UK: London Magazine, December 1911 ;Plot In this particularly serious story, Rutherford Maxwell, an English writer, works for the New Asiatic Bank in New York. He lives in an apartment building called Alcala, where the chorus girl Peggy Norton also lives. She is friendly, though she thinks Rutherford's name is too long and nicknames him George. Rutherford is in a relationship with a girl back in England, whose photograph is on his mantelpiece. Peggy knows this and flirts with him anyway, but he intends to just be her friend. Rutherford tells Peggy about his dream of living in rural England, while Peggy says she prefers New York. Nonetheless, she is jealous of the girl in Rutherford's photograph, Alice Halliday, and starts sobbing. She quickly leaves and later apologizes. For a while, she is away performing in Chicago, and Rutherford finds himself lonely and lacking creative inspiration. Peggy finally returns, and, happy to see her, he treats her to supper. She suggests he make one of his stories into a play by tailoring the lead role to fit the actor Winfield Knight, whom she used to know. In a taxi, Peggy cries again, and Rutherford embraces her and kisses her. Back at Alcala, there is a letter for him, with familiar handwriting, and Rutherford composes himself. Peggy helps Rutherford make the lead role suit Winfield. Winfield is delighted with the part. Late on opening night, Rutherford tells Peggy about the play's great success. He thanks Peggy for her help. She supposes Rutherford will return to England soon, now that he has become successful. However, Rutherford now wishes to stay with Peggy and asks her to marry him. Peggy refuses. She implies that she partially lives off the money of men like Winfield, and is in such a relationship now. Rutherford does not hold this against her. She reminds Rutherford that his real happiness lies in England, and says he would regret staying with her in New York. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves. Rutherford picks up the photograph of Alice and looks at it by the window. A shaft of sunlight falls upon it.

Terminal font family contains fonts encoded in various DOS code pages, with multiple resolutions of the font for each code page. Fixedsys fonts of different code pages have different point sizes. Under DBCS Windows environment, specifying Terminal font may also cause application to use non- Terminal fonts when displaying texts. In Windows 2000 or later, changing script setting in some application's font dialogue (e.g., Notepad, WordPad) causes Terminal font to look completely different, even under same font size. Similarly, changing language setting for Windows applications that do not support Unicode will alter the appearance of OEM/DOS scripted Terminal font. Terminal is also the font that most text pads from ASCII art should be viewed as, because Terminal is often a visual font. Terminal is based upon code page 437 (or other codepage with suitable language, such as CP850) and is not aligned with Unicode. Most of the characters in Terminal are the same as the characters used in code page 437, but some of the characters (most Greek letters and some box drawing characters) may or may not have been replaced by additional accented letters, depending on the codepage of the system.

Early life and education Ellet was born at Penn's Manor in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of six sons and the second youngest of fourteen children. In 1824, his family moved to Philadelphia where he attended the public schools. At age 16, he moved to Bunker Hill, Illinois and worked in farming. A farmer and dry goods store owner, he was a resident of Illinois when the Civil War began. American civil war In July 1861, Ellet raised a company of men from Bunker Hill and was commissioned captain of company I of the 9th Missouri Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which later became the 59th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment.Combined Military Service Record In March 1862, he fought in the Battle of Pea Ridge. When his elder brother, Col. Charles Ellet, Jr., created and took command of the United States Ram Fleet, a fleet of steam- powered rams, in the spring of 1862. Alfred became lieutenant colonel and second in command of the ram fleet. =First battle of Memphis= USS Monarch and forced the surrender of the CSS General Price during the First Battle of Memphis On June 6, Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr. led the rams in the Battle of Memphis as captain of with Alfred W. in command of the USS Monarch. The Ellets had not coordinated a plan of attack with Charles H. Davis, commander of the Mississippi River Squadron. When the flotilla approached Confederate forces, the two rams steamed ahead of Davis' gunboats. The Queen of the West rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . The Monarch rammed and disabled the CSS General Price and forced her to ground on the riverbank. Charles Ellet, Jr. was wounded in the knee by a Confederate sharpshooter during the battle. His wound was the only serious casualty received on the Union side during the battle. Charles Ellet, Jr. died 15 days later due to a blood infection due to the wound and Alfred took command of the unit. On June 26, Alfred W. Ellet commanded the Monarch and his nephew Charles Rivers Ellet commanded the Lancaster during action on the Yazoo River near Liverpool, Mississippi to capture or destroy three Confederate gunboats. The Confederates burned their ships; the CSS General Van Dorn, CSS General Polk and CSS Livingston, when they saw the Union forces approaching. =Mississippi Marine Brigade= In November 1, 1862, Ellet was promoted to brigadier general and charged with creation of the Mississippi Marine Brigade, an amphibious raiding unit. The unit was to contain an infantry regiment, two cavalry squadrons, an artillery battery and the U.S. Ram Fleet. Ellet had difficulties recruiting for the brigade and General Ulysses S. Grant was ordered to reinforce the Mississippi Marine Brigade with a company of men from the 18th Illinois Infantry Regiment. Ellet had to eventually request that General Henry Halleck allow his unit to recruit from convalescing veterans of other units. Ellet promised recruits bonuses, the opportunity to serve aboard clean vessels with good food and the potential for fame. He was eventually able to fully recruit for the brigade and his nephews Charles R. Ellet and John A. Ellet served under him. On June 14, Ellet led the brigade along with Brigadier General Joseph A. Mower in the Battle of Richmond, Louisiana and skirmished with the Confederates, losing 3 wounded. On June 30, Ellet led the brigade in action at the Goodrich's Landing. Two African-American Union regiments, the 1st Arkansas and the 10th Louisiana had come under attack from Confederate forces. The brigade arrived and pushed back the Confederate forces, suffering two casualties and one death. In August 1863, the Mississippi Marine Brigade was placed under command of General Grant. He commanded the Mississippi Marine Brigade during operations on the Western Rivers until 1864, when the unit was disestablished. There were allegations of profiteering levied against Ellet due to irregularities in accounting of seized Confederate cotton. He resigned his commission late in 1864 and returned to civilian life. Following the Civil War, Ellet was a businessman and civic leader in El Dorado, Kansas, where he died. He is buried there in Belle Vista Cemetery. Legacy The U.S. Navy destroyer, USS Ellet (DD-398), in service in 1939-46, was named in honor of Ellet and other members of his family.

As well as trading in tobacco he dealt in other Caribbean commodities, such as tan and sugar. He was an early partner in the Glasgow Tan Work, and in the Eastern Sugarhouse. He was Rector of the University of Glasgow three times between 1738 and 1750 and was the father of the young adventurer, George Bogle, private secretary to Warren Hastings, who led the first attempted British embassy from India to Tibet and the Emperor of China in 1774. The Bogles George Bogle, Junior, came from an ambitious family which had farmed, rented, tenanted then owned land in the west of Scotland for at least 200 years. They are well documented in the land rolls of the Archbishopric of Glasgow, who owned much of the land to the east of Glasgow. There is a curate, Patrick Bogle, of the \\"church of Caddir\\" mentioned in 1509. In 1510,\\"Thomas Bogyl\\" of Chedylstoun is mentioned. In 1555, \\"Isobell Bogyl\\" is mentioned in relation to \\"Daldowy Wester\\" and in 1569, \\"Wylzem Bogylle\\" is referred to as having \\"the lands of Carmyl, callet \\"Bogylis Hole\\". After the Reformation the Bogyle seem to have taken over their lands from the church. In 1690, an Act of the Scottish Parliament recorded the return of lands to \\"Tomas Bogle of Boglehole\\", after forfeiture (presumably having chosen the wrong side during the Civil Wars ). A George Bogle, senior, died in 1707, and was buried at the east end of Glasgow Cathedral . This was the year of the Parliamentary Union between Scotland and England which opened up both England and the English Empire to ambitious Scottish merchants, from which the Bogles profited greatly. After George Senior, the family divided into three branches ‚Äì the Shettleston branch, the Daldowie branch and the Carmyle, or Bogleshole branch. Each has a confusing fondness for certain first names -- particularly Robert and George -- but had (mostly) good fortune in trade and in marriages to Scotland's land, commercial and legal elites. The Bogles of Daldowie The lands of Easter Daldowie lie 5 miles east of Glasgow between the North Calder Water and the River Clyde . George Senior's father, Robert Bogle, was a considerable Glasgow merchant, having been Dean of Guild twice (in 1661 and 1667). George Senior's son, another Robert, was Dean of Guild in 1728. He purchased Easter Daldowie in 1724. Robert died in 1734 and the George Bogle of this article took possession of Daldowie (and also lands at Whiteinch ). A house is marked at Daldowie on Timothy Pont's manuscript of 1596, published in 1654 at Amsterdam but this was not suitable for a man of George Senior's status. By 1745 he had erected in its stead a magnificent mansion (later much extended). In that year, Bonnie Prince Charlie was in Glasgow with his army and on Christmas Day sent a George (like most of the local gentry, reluctant to support this rebellion) a demand for hay, oats and straw for his horses \\"under pain of military execution\\". The Highlanders who came to collect the supplies, also stole some horses and abused George's servants. George complained to the Prince, and received from him, on the 29th, a warrant \\"to protect and defend the estate, house and horses of George Bogle, Jnr, of Daldowie\\". Later, the family went to Bothwell Bridge to see the Prince and his army pass. George's elder daughter describe Charles as \\"a fine looking young man, with long fair hair\\". George Bogle of Daldowie married Anne Sinclair (connected to an influential Lord of Session ‚Äì and, distantly, to Oliver Cromwell) ‚Äì in 1731, by whom he had three sons and four daughters. The youngest son was a third George Bogle, (born 1747) who used family connections, and the influence of Henry Dundas, to get a position as private secretary to Warren Hastings of the British East India Company. This latter George Bogle was asked by Warren Hastings to lead an expedition from Calcutta to Tibet in an effort to get the Lama to persuade the Chinese Emperor to establish ties with Britain. He established good relations with the Lamas and even had two daughters, Martha and Mary, by a princess of Tibet, one of the Lama's daughters. These two daughters were later sent to Scotland to be educated. Bogle's diary was later sent by Warren Hastings to Dr Samuel Johnson in London to be published. He died, young and unmarried, in Calcutta in 1781.

The band also included Daryl Hirsch, Alec Meltzer, and Rick Sieber. Steel guitarist Mike \\"Slo Mo\\" Brenner contributed to the band's recordings, an arrangement and sonic result similar to Bruce Kaphan's work with American Music Club. In a city best known for its soul and R & B artists, One Star Hotel stood out because of a sound more reminiscent of alternative country or Americana music. Originally called Stereo Field, the band changed its name to One Star Hotel before the release of its first, self-titled album in 2003. They kept the name Stereo Field for their independent record label. A second disc, Good Morning, West Gordon was released in November 2004, garnering favorable reviews in a number of American newspapers, magazines, and web-based music sites. Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer characterized Yutzy-Burkey's musical style as \\"convey[ing] torn-apartnesss without even trying... transforming those overworked three chords into something almost magical again.\\" Another reviewer, John Takiff described One Star Hotel as \\"the sonic equivalent of an Edward Hopper painting.\\" Comparisons to the Chicago- based Wilco (one of alt-country's most popular bands) often dogged One Star Hotel, although the comparisons owed less to derivativeness than to similar musical roots in the classic rock sound of The Band, Neil Young, and Big Star. One Star Hotel opened for Wilco on a tour of the Netherlands in the fall of 2005. Following the tour, a brief message announcing that One Star Hotel was \\"packing it in\\" appeared on the band's website, a surprising and enigmatic end for a band that seemed poised for bigger things.

Early career She was educated at the School of St Helen and St Katharine in Abingdon, New Hall, Cambridge and the University of East Anglia (MA Creative Writing). In the early 1970s she worked under the name of Mary Adames as an actress in repertory theatre and the West End. She appeared in an early London production of The Rocky Horror Show and toured with Godspell. After working for private companies as a management trainer and consultant, as well as running Watermans Arts Centre in west London, Allen worked for the Arts Council of England rising to the position of Secretary General in 1994 just as the organisation took on the responsibility of distributing National Lottery funds, before becoming Chief Executive of the Royal Opera House in London. The Royal Opera House In mid-1996, with the retirement of then general director Jeremy Isaacs approaching with a year, consideration of a likely successor generated some speculation in the British press.David Lister, \\"Arts: A woman to replace Isaacs at the ROH\\", The Independent (London), 4 July 1996 Retrieved 27 January 2010 Among the four women named were Genista McIntosh and Mary Allen, although the latter \\"publicly stated that she would not be taking the job\\". McIntosh became General Director of the Royal Opera House in early 1997, but resigned after five months on the job due to ill health. Allen was immediately approached by \\"the Royal Opera House's chairman, Lord Chadlington, (who) then appointed Mrs Allen to replace her without advertising the post.\\" .David Lister, \\"Allen goes sick as RoH crisis deepens\\", The Independent (London), 27 May 1997 Retrieved 27 January 2010 Although he was not \\"not happy\\" with the appointment, the decision was accepted by Chris Smith as the responsible minister, even though it breached the conditions of the Arts Council's own funding for the organisation. Although Allen took over her new post unaware how close the organisation was to bankruptcy, she began steering the major refurbishment of the House. Later that year a Select committee investigation was led by Gerald Kaufman MP. He was critical of Allen's actions and \\"demanded her removal 'with immediate effect' \\". This led to her offering to resign.Norman Lebrecht, \\"Last act at the Royal Opera?

Introduction Petit-Thouars came from an aristocratic family of the region of Anjou, where he grew up in the castle of Boumois, near Saumur. In 1792, after an imprisonment of two years during the French Revolution, he was exiled to Madagascar and the nearby islands such as La R√©union (then called Bourbon). He started collecting many plant specimens on Madagascar, Mauritius and La R√©union. Ten years later he was able to return to France with a collection of about 2000 plants. Most of his collection went to the Mus√©um de Paris, while some species ended up at Kew. He was elected member of the prestigious Acad√©mie des Sciences on 10 April 1820. Du Petit- Thouars is remembered as the author of the book Histoire des v√©g√©taux recueillis dans les √Æles de France, de Bourbon et de Madagascar (usually abbreviated in botanic literature as Hist. v√©g. √Æles France), illustrated by many beautiful drawings. Other books followed: M√©langes de botanique et de voyages and Histoire particuli√®re des plantes orchid√©es recueillies dans les trois √Æles australes de France, de Bourbon et de Madagascar (l'√Æle de France is the present island of Mauritius and l'√Æle de Bourbon is the present La R√©union).

One of James' most noted ghost stories, \\"The Jolly Corner\\" describes the adventures of Spencer Brydon as he prowls the now-empty New York house where he grew up. He encounters a \\"sensation more complex than had ever before found itself consistent with sanity.\\" Plot summary Spencer Brydon returns to New York City after thirty-three years abroad. He has returned to \\"look at his 'property,'\\" two buildings, one his boyhood home on \\"the jolly corner.\\" The second, larger structure is now going to be renovated into a big apartment building. These properties have been the source of his income since the deaths of his family members. Spencer finds he is good at directing this renovation, despite never having done this work before, suggesting that his innate ability for business was hiding deep within him unused. Spencer rekindles a relationship with an old friend, Alice Staverton. Both comment on his \\"real gift\\" for business and construction which he also finds \\"vulgar and sordid.\\" He starts to wonder who he would have been if he had stayed in the U.S. He starts to prowl the house at night to try to meet his American alter ego. Brydon has begun to realize that he might have been an astute businessman if he hadn't forsaken moneymaking for a more leisurely life. He discusses this possibility with Alice Staverton, his friend who has always lived in New York. Meanwhile Brydon begins to believe that his alter ego--the ghost of the man he might have been --is haunting the \\"jolly corner\\", his nickname for the old family house. After a harrowing night of pursuit in the house, Brydon finally confronts the ghost, who advances on him and overpowers him with \\"a rage of personality before which his own collapsed.\\" Brydon eventually awakens with his head pillowed on Alice Staverton's lap. It is arguable whether or not Spencer had actually become unconscious or whether he had died and has awoken in an afterlife. She had come to the house because she sensed he was in danger. She tells him that she pities the ghost of his alter ego, who has suffered and lost two fingers from his right hand. But she also embraces and accepts Brydon as he is. Adaptations A television version of the story was produced during 1975 with Fritz Weaver as Spencer Brydon and Salome Jens as Alice Staverton. An episode of Mike Flanagan's The Haunting of Bly Manor, also titled The Jolly Corner, is inspired after this story.

For example, a front-page article in The Independent on May 10, 2006 stated that Ruth Kelly, a senior British Government Minister, was questioned about her affiliations: \\"Ms Kelly's early days as Education Secretary were dogged with questions about her religion, and her membership of the conservative Opus Dei organization which features in the best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code.\\"The Independent, May 10, 2006 Religious disputes =Mary Magdalene= The novel asserts that Mary Magdalene was of the Tribe of Benjamin, but historians dispute this claim, and there is no mention of this in the Bible or in other ancient sources. Sandra Miesel and Carl E. Olson, writing in their 2004 book, The Da Vinci Hoax, state the fact that Magdala was located in northern Israel, whereas the tribe of Benjamin resided in the south. In Chapter 58 it is suggested that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene created a \\"potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne.\\" Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is without any historical basis, but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a \\"mortal prophet\\", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would have any interest in him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, \\"Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? I mean, what does that mean? If he's not God, why is he married to a goddess?\\" Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered \\"rightful\\" heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea. Characters in the book also claim that Mary Magdalene was labeled a prostitute by the Church. While Catholic tradition in the past, in contrast to other Christian traditions, defended these imputations,\\"St. Mary Magdalen\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. Retrieved July 15, 2013. these claims are now rejected by the majority of biblical scholars, Catholic and non- Catholic alike, according to Carol Ann Morrow of AmericanCatholic.org. Also, Pope Gregory I's teaching about Mary Magdalene, though popular throughout much of the Church's history, was never formally integrated into Catholic dogma; nor was he speaking ex cathedra at the time, so his speech is not seen as infallible. Whatever weight is given to this tradition, however, there is no evidence that it was used to defame Mary, who was considered a saint to whose honor churches were built. She is also respected as a witness to Christ's resurrection as written in the Gospels. Alleged marriage to Jesus The story claims the \\"Holy Grail\\" is not a chalice but a bloodline sprung from the marital union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. This idea is not original to Brown; it was previously hypothesized by others, including Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Many textual and historical scholars have characterized this claim as being without evidence. Women in the Gospels were usually identified with husbands or male relatives, especially if they shared their names with others. For example, there are many mentions of women called \\"Mary\\", all designated differently (any possible identification with each other nonwithstanding). There is Mary \\"the mother of Jesus\\", Mary Magdalene, Mary \\"the mother of James and Joses\\", Mary \\"[the mother] of James\\", \\"the other\\" Mary, Mary \\"the wife of Cl[e]opas\\" and Mary of Bethany, the sister of Lazarus and Martha. Mary Magdalene stands out from most of the other Marys as she is not directly associated with any man. Mary \\"Magdalene\\" means \\"Mary of Magdala\\", just as Jesus \\"the Nazarene\\" means \\"Jesus of Nazareth.\\" Some researchers have claimed that, if indeed she was married to Jesus, she would have been designated, following custom, Mary \\"the wife of Jesus\\" instead. According to The Da Vinci Hoax, the use of the term \\"bride of Christ\\" for the Church in some of the letters of Paul (Ephesians 5:25‚Äì27, 2 Corinthians 11:2‚Äì3) and the Book of Revelation suggests that Jesus was not married. The authors of that work also speculate that the recorded words of Jesus that \\"those people who can remain celibate, for the kingdom of heaven's sake should do so\\" (Matt. 19:12) were made in response to criticisms of his own celibacy. In the novel, a line of the Gospel of Philip is quoted where Mary Magdalene is referred to as Jesus' \\"companion\\", and a character of The Da Vinci Code says that Aramaic scholars know that this means \\"wife\\". James M. Robinson, an authority on the gnostic gospels, has responded to this passage by pointing out that \\"companion\\" was not necessarily a sex-related term. In addition, \\"the Gospel of Philip is in Coptic, translated from Greek, so there is no word in the text for Aramaic scholars to consider. The Gospel of Philip depicts Mary as Jesus's koinonos, a Greek term indicating a 'close friend', 'companion' or, potentially, a lover. In context of Gnostic beliefs, Gnostic writings use Mary to illustrate a disciple's spiritual relationship with Jesus, making any physical relationship irrelevant. Mary Magdalene in Leonardo's The Last Supper The Last Supper Many art historians dispute that Leonardo's famous The Last Supper depicts Mary Magdalene beside Jesus.\\"Decoding The Da Vinci Code\\". Seattle Pacific University. Summer 2005. Volume 28, Number 2. Retrieved July 15, 2013. =Jesus in Church teaching= According to Sir Leigh Teabing in Chapter 55 of the novel, the early Church consolidated its power by suppressing ideas about the sacred feminine and elevating the mortal prophet Jesus into a divine being. According to Religion Facts, the questions discussed by the Council were not whether he was divine, as the New Testament authors already believed that he was, but what his precise relationship to God was. In particular, the Council decided upon the question of whether Jesus was homoousios, \\"of one substance\\" with God the Father, or whether instead Jesus was the first created being, inferior to the Father but like him, but still superior to all other beings (see Arianism), or whether he was merely of like substance to the father, or homoiousios. =Portrayal of Gnostic Christianity= The novel claims Constantine wanted Christianity to unify the Roman Empire but thought it would appeal to pagans only if it featured a demigod similar to pagan heroes, so he destroyed the Gnostic Gospels that said Jesus was a human prophet and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which portray Jesus as divine. Historically, however, Gnostic Christianity did not portray Jesus as merely human. In fact, the Gnostic Jesus was less human than the Jesus of orthodox Christianity. While orthodox Christianity generally considered Christ both divine and human, many Gnostic sects considered Christ purely divine, his human body being a mere illusion (see Docetism). Many Gnostics saw matter as evil, and believed that a divine spirit would never have taken on a material body. Some varieties of Gnosticism went so far as to hold that the God of the Jews is only a demiurge who has trapped humanity in a fleshly prison; and that Christ is an emanation of the true God, sent to free humanity from that bondage to the flesh. (See Marcionism, Aeon, Archon). =Sacred feminine= Characters in the book claim Christianity has suppressed the sacred feminine, the representation of the earth or mother Goddess' mystic power that's often linked to symbols of fertility and reproduction, such as Venus and Isis. Early Christian devotion to female martyrs (such as Perpetua and Felicity) and the apocryphal writings about figures like St. Thecla seem to indicate that women did play a role in the early Church, far more than either Brown or some modern critics of Christianity acknowledge, though historical evidence does not suggest men and women shared all roles of office. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches particularly venerate the Virgin Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, but the book deems this a desexualised aspect of femininity that suppresses the sacred feminine. Brown echoes scholars such as Joseph Campbell in saying this image of Mary derives from Isis and her child Horus.\\"The antique model for the Madonna, actually, is Isis with Horus at her breast\\" The Power of Myth, 1988 (first edition), p. 176 Meisel and Olson counters that the \\"Mother and child\\" symbol, as a universal part of the general human experience, can be found in other faiths; so Christianity did not copy this element from Egyptian mythology. Christian documents and traditions tend to stress the virtues of chaste womanhood in keeping with general Christian encouragement of chastity for both genders. The Gnostics expressed anti-female views, for example, in the Gospel of Thomas's famous ending verse where Jesus says he will make Mary into a male to make her worthy to enter the Kingdom. =Goddess worship= Israelites While the character Robert Langdon claims in the book that early Israelites worshipped the goddess Shekinah as Yahweh's equal, this is contradictory to Jewish theology. Judaism is and was a monotheistic religion, and belief in a goddess counterpart to God is both illogical and expressly forbidden. In fact, the term Shekinah (derived from Hebrew for \\"dwelling\\") does not appear in early Judaism at all, but later Talmudic Judaism used it to refer to the God's \\"dwelling\\" or presence among his people. The term describes a spiritual radiance. Critics argue that this comes from an understanding of Kabbalah, which speaks of God as having \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" attributes in the Sephirot.Hansard, Mark. \\"The Da Vinci Code Movie: Checking the Facts\\". Jesus & DaVinci. 2006. Retrieved July 31, 2011. Early Judaism did not deny the existence of other gods. \\"For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord.\\" =The Bible= Carl Olson and Sandra Miesel state that contrary to the book's claims, the Gnostic Gospels (e.g. the Gospels of Thomas, Philip, Mary Magdalene, and the Judas) also do not focus more on Jesus' humanity. The other known Gospels, for the most part, treat Jesus as more otherworldly and lack the humanizing detail of the Biblical accounts. The assertion that \\"more than eighty gospels\\" were written, with only the familiar four chosen as canonical, greatly exaggerates the number of Gnostic Gospels written. The assertion that the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 (not the 1950s as Brown predicates), contain lost or hidden Gospels is also false. The scrolls contain books of the Hebrew Scriptures, apocryphal and pseudepigraphic books, and manuals used by the Jewish community at Qumran. No definite Christian documents‚Äîorthodox, Gnostic, or otherwise‚Äîhave ever been found at this site, with the possible exception of 7Q5. =Opus Dei= The depiction of Opus Dei as a monastic order which is the Pope's \\"personal prelature\\" is inaccurate. In fact, there are no monks in Opus Dei, which has primarily lay membership and whose celibate lay members are called numeraries. But it may be explained by the fact that Silas is referred to as a monk mostly by the protagonists, Langdon and Neveu, who are shown to have little knowledge of Opus Dei. The word numerary is used to refer to Silas, by actual Opus Dei members such as the person at Opus Dei centre in London. Moreover, Opus Dei encourages its lay members to avoid practices that are perceived as fundamentalist to the outside world. The term personal prelature does not refer to a special relationship to the Pope; it means an institution in which the jurisdiction of the prelate is not linked to a territory but over persons, wherever they be. Silas, the murderous \\"Opus Dei monk\\", uses a cilice and flagellates himself. Some members of Opus Dei do practice voluntary mortification of the flesh, which has been a Christian tradition since at least St. Anthony in the third century, and it has also been practiced by Mother Teresa, Padre Pio, the child visionaries of Our Lady of Fatima, and slain archbishop √ìscar Romero. Saint Thomas More and Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England both wore hairshirts in the Tudor era. Critics have accused the book of depicting the order as misogynistic, a claim which the order's defenders say has no basis in reality because half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women. Critics also say that the novel's allegations of dealings between John Paul II and the order concerning the Vatican Bank also have no basis in reality. Allegedly due to these dealings, Opus Dei's founder was declared a Saint just 20 years after his death. In reality, Josemar√≠a Escriv√° was canonized 27 years after his death; admittedly faster than some others‚Äîbut this is attributed to streamlining of the whole process and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known. In the novel, the head of Opus Dei travels alone and makes momentous decisions on his own. In real life, the head of Opus Dei is usually accompanied by two other priests called custodes or guardians. Decision making in Opus Dei is \\"collegial\\": i.e. the head has only one vote. Historical disputes =Leonardo da Vinci= The contention that the Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo as an androgynous \\"whole\\" humanity that represented both genders is contested by Olson and Meisel's book, in which they state that reputable art historians have explained that it is simply a masterful portrait of a woman. Olson and Meisel also take issue with the idea that Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa as a self-portrait, and that this idea is based on the fact that points of congruency are found between Leonardo's face and the Mona Lisas. Olson and Meisel respond that points of congruency can be found among many faces, which is how computer morphing of faces is facilitated. The title of the book is not consistent with naming conventions, because \\"Da Vinci\\" was not Leonardo's surname. As Tom Chivers of The Daily Telegraph comments, \\"[Leonardo] was from Vinci, or of Vinci. As many critics have pointed out, calling it The Da Vinci Code is like referring to Lawrence of Arabia as Mr. Of Arabia, or asking What Nazareth Do?\\". =Knights Templar= The allegation that Pope Clement V burned the Templars to ashes and threw the ashes into the Tiber River in Rome is false. The last leaders of the Knights Templar were killed in France in 1314 by King Philip IV of France, being burned at the stake on a small island in the Seine. Pope Clement's administration was not in Rome as he had moved the papal headquarters to Avignon. =The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail= The legend of the Holy Grail alleged that a sacred relic (in many versions, either the cup used at the Last Supper, or the cup said to have been used by Joseph of Arimathea to collect blood of Christ ‚Äì or both) existed, which would bring untold blessings to any pure knight who found it. The story appeared around the time of the Crusades and is featured in Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In Old French, the Holy Grail was written as San Graal. However The Da Vinci Code, taking cues from The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, interprets this as \\"Sang R√©al\\" and translated this as \\"royal blood\\". In early Grail romances, graal in fact denotes a large dish for fish, itself a Christian religious symbol, but clearly removed from the traditional cup. The idea of a cup seems to have developed quickly during the late 12th and early 13th centuries, influenced both by apocryphal religious stories, such as that of Joseph of Arimathea, and pagan stories involving magic containers that, for example, produced endless food (itself a useful parallel to the Christian belief of the 'Bread of Life' produced at the Feeding of the Five Thousand). The cup therefore presented a convenient fusion, like many of the stories that are now associated with the Quest for the Holy Grail and King Arthur, of (albeit apocryphal) Christian teachings, and pagan traditions. =France the country= Several claims about the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris are disputed. While there is a brass line running north‚Äìsouth through the church, it is not a part of the Paris Meridian. The line is instead more of a gnomon or sundial/calendar, meant to mark the solstice and equinoxes. Further, there is no evidence that there was ever a temple of Isis on the site. This note has been on display in the church:Benishal, Richard. \\"Articles ‚Äì Saint Sulpice and the 'Rose-Line'\\" . Geobiology.co.il.

Acorn Media. Channel 4. First broadcast > February 3, 2005 The reference to Paris having been founded by the Merovingians (Chapter 55) is false; in fact, the city was settled by Gauls by the 3rd century BC. The Romans, who knew it as Lutetia, captured it in 52 BC under Julius Caesar, and left substantial ruins in the city, including an amphitheater and public baths. The Merovingians did not rule in France until the 5th century AD, by which time Paris was at least 800 years old. Scientific disputes Brown characterized the cycle of Venus as \\"trac[ing] a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every four years\\". This was corrected to \\"eight years\\" in some later editions, such as the British paperback and the April 2003 printing of the US hardback. Steve Olson, author of Mapping Human History: Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins, writing in an article in Nature, says that the notion that a small number of people living today could be the only descendants from any particular person who lived millennia ago, such as Jesus and Mary, is statistically flawed. According to Olson, \\"If anyone living today is descended from Jesus, so are most of us on the planet.\\" Near the end of the novel, Sophie and Langdon are standing outside Rosslyn Chapel in the evening, Brown describes them looking to the east watching Venus rise above the horizon in the twilight. Astronomically, due to the location of its orbit between the earth and the sun, Venus is only visible rising in the east early in the morning shortly before sunrise or setting in the evening toward the west shortly after sunset. It is not possible to see Venus rising above the eastern horizon in the evening. Allegations of plagiarism Two lawsuits have been brought alleging plagiarism in The Da Vinci Code.Armstrong, Ruth. \\"Da Vinci author is hit by fresh plagiarism claim\\". The Scotsman. January 12, 2005 On April 11, 2005, novelist Lewis Perdue sued Brown and his publisher Random House for plagiarizing his novels The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (1999), claiming \\"there are far too many parallels between my books and The Da Vinci Code for it to be an accident.\\" On August 4, 2005, District Judge George B. Daniels granted a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit, ruling that \\"a reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God. Any slightly similar elements are on the level of generalized or otherwise unprotectable ideas.\\" He affirmed that The Da Vinci Code does not infringe upon copyrights held by Perdue. In February 2006, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, two of the three authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, took the UK publisher of The Da Vinci Code to court for breach of copyright, alleging plagiarism.Kennedy, Maev (February 28, 2006). In a packed high court, a new twist in The Da Vinci Code begins to unfold. The Guardian. Some sources suggested the lawsuit was a publicity stuntExpanding on a theory isn't plagiarism, Collegiate Times, March 14, 2006 intended to boost sales of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (a boost which did in fact occur). However, the projected court costs of over 1 million pounds outweigh or at least substantially reduce the financial benefit of the lawsuit.\\"Publish and be damned if you don't sell more\\". The Birmingham Post. March 10, 2006 Dan Brown repeatedly said in his defense that history cannot be plagiarized and therefore the accusations of the two authors were false. Leigh stated, \\"It's not that Dan Brown has lifted certain ideas because a number of people have done that before. It's rather that he's lifted the whole architecture ‚Äì the whole jigsaw puzzle ‚Äì and hung it on to the peg of a fictional thriller\\".\\"Da Vinci trial pits history against art\\". The Observer. February 26, 2006 Dan Brown has admitted some of the ideas taken from Baigent and Leigh's work were indispensable to the book but stated that there were many other sources also behind it. However, he claimed that neither he nor his wife had read Baigent and Leigh's book when he produced his original \\"synopsis\\" of the novel.The key to \\"The Da Vinci Code?\\" Dan Brown's wife, Reuters/Yahoo!

The Sunday Times. February 25, 2006 On April 7, 2006, High Court judge Sir Peter Smith rejected the copyright-infringement claim by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, and Random House won the court case. However, in the published extracts of his judgement\\"The Da Vinci Code case judgement\\". BBC News. April 7, 2006 the judge criticised the non-appearance of Blythe Brown and the vagueness of Dan Brown's evidence, saying, \\"He has presented himself as being a deep and thorough researcher...evidence in this case demonstrates that as regards DVC [The Da Vinci Code] that is simply not correct with respect to historical lectures...The reality of his research is that it is superficial.\\"\\"The Da Vinci Code case judgement\\". BBC News. April 7, 2006.\\"Da Vinci Code Publisher Random House Wins In Court\\". ABC News/Associated Press. April 7, 2006. The judge also included a code in his judgment. Throughout the judgment, apparently random letters are italicised and these form the message. The letters in the first paragraphs spell smithy code and the rest appear as follows \\"jaeiextostgpsacgreamqwfkadpmqzv\\". This was subsequently decoded to read \\"Smithy Code Jackie Fisher who are you Dreadnought\\", referring to the British admiral whom Judge Smith admires. As with the book, this secret message made use of Fibonacci numbers for its encoding. Dan Brown has been sued twice in the United States by author Jack Dunn, who claims Dan Brown copied his book The Vatican Boys (1997) to create The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons and Brown's now famous character Robert Langdon. Jack Dunn calls Dan Brown's actions, \\"the largest literary and movie crime in history.\\" Christian response At a conference on April 28, 2006, Archbishop Angelo Amato, the secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican curial department, specifically called for a boycott of the film version of The Da Vinci Code, characterizing the film as \\"full of calumnies, offenses, and historical and theological errors.\\" The film was rated as \\"morally offensive\\" by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.Maier, Paul L. \\"THE DA VINCI CODE: TOOL FOR EVANGELISM?\\". Christian Research Institute. Retrieved July 31, 2011. In India, home to 30 million Christians (3% of the population), the Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an adult rating on condition that disclaimers saying it was a work of fiction were inserted at the beginning and end of the film. In contrast, some Catholic groups sought to use interest in this book and film as a means to educate Catholics and non-Catholics on the history of the Christian Church, and what it teaches regarding Jesus Christ. Similarly, other Christians have looked to use the film as a tool for evangelism.

Accessed February 8, 2015. History Hopelawn was the homestead and farm of Luther M. Hope in the 19th century. After its establishment, the original streets were named after Luther Hope's children (Juliette, Loretta, May, Luther, Lee, Warren, James, Howard, Clyde, John, Ellen, Charles, Herbert, Erin, Emmitt, William). Originally called Hope's Lawn, it was later shortened to Hopelawn. Luther Martin Hope, who was born at Modestown, Virginia, June 9, 1839, and came as a young man to Brooklyn, New York, and then to Perth Amboy, New Jersey. For many years he carried on a mercantile business in Perth Amboy, but during the latter years of his life retired and made his home on what was then known as the old Billy Watson's farm, now \\"Hopelawn,\\" in Perth Amboy, his death occurring there January 25, 1907. Hopelawn was originally two communities Ellendale Terrace from May Street south to New Brunswick Avenue and Hopelawn from May Street north to West Pond Road sections such as Washington Heights, the area of Pennsylvania Avenue and Garden State Parkway and Florida Grove along Florida Grove Rd. from West Pond Road to Lee Street. Hopelawn was famous for its abundance of high quality clay. The Such Clay Company and the McHose Clay Company extracted clay from the area south of New Brunswick Avenue, west of Florida Grove Road, from Hopelawn to Keasbey. This area was referred to as \\"The Clay Banks\\". The Clay Banks contained several \\"Old Fashion Swimming Holes\\" and \\"Fishing Ponds\\" as well as the only baseball field in town until the baseball field next to #10 School was built in the late 1940s. There were two sets of railroad tracks that crossed the Hopelawn Clay Banks, east to west. The rail line originated in Pennsylvania and terminated in Perth Amboy and was operated by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The right-of-way became part of the Middlesex Greenway. In the late 1930s and 1940s, Hopelawn was the home of a Semi Pro Football team known as the \\"Hopelawn Greyhounds\\". The games against the \\"Woodbridge Golden Bears\\" were legendary. The team disbanded because of World War II. After the war many of the \\"Greyhound\\" (Maroon and Grey) players joined and went on to star with the \\"Golden Bears\\" (Gold and Black) owned and coached by Tony Caceola. Mary C. Fee, teacher and school principal, served the residents of Hopelawn from 1919-1969 at Hopelawn's only school, Elementary School #10. After her retirement a street was named in her honor, Mary C. Fee Lane, adjacent to the school. The school is no longer in operation. A library in the basement of the building remained until the property was purchased and sold in the 1990s. The building is now a functioning church. Although Hopelawn is within the borders of the Township of Woodbridge, it uses the same ZIP Code, 08861, as the neighboring City of Perth Amboy. Hopelawn Volunteer Engine Co. #1  Hopelawn Engine Co. No. 1 was organized December 3, 1914, as the Hopelawn Fire Department No. 1. The first headquarters was in Ed O'Brien's barber shop on Florida Grove Road and the equipment was one dozen buckets. The first fire, a few weeks after organizing, was about a half mile at Al Black's farm, All the members responded, running with their buckets to put out the hay barn fire. Buckets were used until 1916 when the Fords fire commissioners purchased a chemical wagon which was pulled by manpower The next fire was at the McHose building on the corner of Florida Grove Road and New Brunswick Avenue, and the firemen were able to save the building. New equipment was purchased and housed in Barrett's barn on the corner of Florida Grove Road- and May Street. An alarm system consisting of a locomotive wheel and hammer was also set up at this site. In 1918 lots were purchased at the on the corner of May and Charles Streets and the building was erected in 1921. Hopelawn's first fire chief was John Jancisko. The Hopelawn First Aid Squad was organized in 1937 by the Hopelawn Engine Co #1. Notable people People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Hopelawn include: *Lou Creekmur, a 1996 inductee of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

It provides a popular presentation of set theory and four dimensional geometry as well as some mystical implications. A foreword is provided by Martin Gardner and the 200+ illustrations are by David Povilaitis. The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality was reprinted in 1985 as the paperback The Fourth Dimension: A Guided Tour of the Higher Universes. It was again reprinted in paperback in 2014 by Dover Publications with its original subtitle. Like other Rucker books, The Fourth Dimension is dedicated to Edwin Abbott Abbott, author of the novella Flatland. Synopsis The Fourth Dimension teaches readers about the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. Several analogies are made to Flatland; in particular, Rucker compares how a square in Flatland would react to a cube in Spaceland to how a cube in Spaceland would react to a hypercube from the fourth dimension. The book also includes multiple puzzles.

Youth career In 1976, Brcic graduated from Bishop DuBourg High School in St. Louis, Missouri where he played on the school's soccer team. He has been inducted into the school's Hall of Fame. After high school, Brcic attended St. Louis University where he played a single season of college soccer. Outdoor soccer In 1977, he left the university to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Brcic remained a back-up with the Cosmos through the 1979 season. Through that year, he had played only eight games in goal. During the 1978-79 off-season, the Cosmos loaned Brcic to Greenock Morton of the Scottish First Division, then the top league in Scotland. After injuries hit Greenock Morton's goalkeepers, the team brought Brcic into its first team where he played six league games, including a win at Aberdeen F.C. on December 20, 1978 during which Brcic stopped a penalty kick.AFC Match Report Brcic returned to the Cosmos for the 1980 season and remained with the team until it folded during the 1984-1985 indoor season. National team Brcic did not only return to the Cosmos in 1979, he also earned his first cap with the U.S. national team when he came on for Arnie Mausser in a May 2, 1979, loss to France. Brcic did not play again for the senior team until 1984. That year he was the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. That year, he also appeared in a May 30 scoreless draw versus Italy and a 4-0 World Cup qualifying win against the Netherlands Antilles on October 6. He played one more game with the senior national team, a 2-1 World Cup qualification victory over Trinidad and Tobago on May 15, 1985. Indoor Soccer By this time Brcic was ending his outdoor professional career and had embarked on his indoor years. He gained his first indoor soccer experience during the 1981-1982 NASL indoor season. He played fourteen games for the Cosmos as they finished with the league's second worst record. Brcic and the Cosmos did much better in the second NASL indoor season, which didn't take place until 1983-1984. He started twenty-six games as New York made it to the championship game before falling to the San Diego Sockers. The next year, the Cosmos entered the Major Indoor Soccer League. However, they were a shell of the team they were a few years prior and folded thirty-three games into the forty-eight game season. Brcic began the season with the Cosmos, but when they collapsed, he moved to the Wichita Wings. At the end of the season, he moved again to the Pittsburgh Spirit for the 1985-1986 season. Although the Spirit finished in the bottom of the standings, Brcic was selected to the first team All MISL list.

He was the Republican leader in 1890 and Speaker in 1895 and 1896. He was selected in 1903 to serve as Assistant Treasurer of the United States in charge of the Wall Street sub-treasury in the Administration of Theodore Roosevelt. His first choice, Robert Bacon, declined the position. He withdrew his second choice, William Plimley, after objections from several senators and New York bank presidents to the appointment of a political aide who had no relevant experience. Roosevelt then nominated Fish, who was promptly confirmed. He resigned from the Treasury in 1908 to run for the United States House of Representatives against Andrew C. Zabriskie. He defeated Zabriskie and was elected to represent New York's 21st district and served for a single term from March 4, 1909, until March 3, 1911. He was defeated for reelection. For many years Fish was considered to be one of the top Republican bosses in the State of New York, controlling Putnam County. Personal life In 1880, Fish was married to Emily Maria Mann (1854‚Äì1899) at St. John's Church in Troy, New York. She was the daughter of Francis N. Mann (1802‚Äì1880) and Mary J. (n√©e Hooker) Mann (1822‚Äì1875). Before her death in 1899, they were the parents of: * Janet Fish (1883‚Äì1970), who died unmarried. * Julia Kean Fish (1884‚Äì1960), who married William Lawrence Breese (1883‚Äì1915) in 1908. He was killed in World War I. His older sister, Eloise Lawrence Breese (1882‚Äì1953), was married Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 2nd Earl of Ancaster (1867‚Äì1951), and his younger sister, Anne Breese (1885‚Äì1959), who was married to Lord Alastair Robert Innes-Ker (b. 1880), the second son of James Innes-Ker, 7th Duke of Roxburghe and a first cousin of Winston Churchill. Lord Alastair's brother, Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe, also married an American, Mary Goelet (1878‚Äì1937), the daughter of the New York real-estate millionaire Ogden Goelet. His younger brother, Lord Robert Edward Innes-Ker (1885‚Äì1958) married the actress Jose Collins.\\"Lord R.

He was given command over Locri in Bruttium by Scipio Africanus after its recapture, considered the \\"outstanding event\\" in Sicilian operations that year.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 141. His governorship, if it should be called that, ended in sacrilege and murder. Military command Pleminius was in charge of the Roman garrison at Rhegium, the geographical location of which on the \\"toe\\" of the Italian peninsula had made it a de facto part of the province of Sicily. From Rhegium he brought a force of 3,000 to take possession of Locri, and succeeded in storming one of Locri's two citadels by the aid of exceptionally tall ladders. This action led to a skirmish with Carthaginian troops, who occupied the other citadel. Hostilities escalated when Hannibal arrived on the scene, but Locrian insiders enabled Pleminius's men to hold out until Scipio could bring troops from Messana, at which time the Carthaginians withdrew. Scipio's intervention technically exceeded the mandate of his command and crossed into the provincia of his consular colleague Crassus.H.H. Scullard, Scipio Africanus in the Second Punic War (Cambridge University Press, 1930),p. 170; Nigel Bagnall, The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage, and the Struggle for the Mediterranean (St. Martin's Press, 1990), p. 273. Scipio immediately rounded up the Locrians who had attempted to secede and executed them. Those who had remained loyal and aided Rome received their reward in the form of their fellow citizens' property. Scipio then sent a delegation to Rome placing the matter of Locri's political status in the hands of the Roman senate, and returned with his troops to Messana. Bruttium had been Hannibal's last stronghold in Italy, and Rome's position there was still tentative; from a diplomatic perspective, it was important to show that Rome was the preferable overlord.Rachel Feig Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders in Mid- Republican Rome, 241‚Äì167 B.C. (Routledge, 1996), p. 78; Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 273. Violence and disorder In Scipio's absence, the soldiers under Pleminius lapsed into looting, which the officers attempted to restrain. Discipline dissolved utterly, and the Roman forces divided into warring troops. The men attached to Pleminius got the worst of it, and reported to him with a display of wounds and complaints of ill treatment.Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 273. Pleminius's reaction to this breakdown of discipline was to have the tribunes arrested, stripped, and flogged. Their men then attacked Pleminius, mutilating his ears and nose. Learning of these disturbances, Scipio returned ‚Äî and reinstated Pleminius. He ordered the offending tribunes sent to Rome to stand trial.Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 274. \\"This judgment,\\" notes H.H. Scullard, \\"is unexpected,\\" and various explanations have been proffered.Was Scipio moved by the mutilations suffered by Pleminius, and angry at the insubordination of his men? Was he giving Pleminius a second chance? Did he foresee consequences, and wished to give Pleminius more room to accrue blame to himself? Was he simply distracted by his plans to invade Africa? These are rehearsed by Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 172. Scullard concludes that Scipio was \\"guilty of folly and of lack of humanity.\\"Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 172. Pinax from Locri depicting Proserpina opening the liknon used in the mystery rites As soon as Scipio left for Sicily, Pleminius had the tribunes seized and tortured them to death, offering a \\"novel\\" justification: \\"No one knew how to name the penalty for a crime except someone who had learnt its savagery by suffering.\\"Richard A. Bauman, Crime and Punishment in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1996), p. 15. They were left unburied.Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders, p. 77. With a rage that seemed unquenchable, Pleminius turned his violence toward Locrians he suspected of informing Scipio. Meanwhile, the Locrian envoys who had traveled to Rome for the senate hearing related in detail how the excesses of the Roman soldiers surpassed those of the Carthaginians. They complained of widespread rapes committed against women and boys dragged from their homes, and the sacrilegious looting of the Temple of Proserpina, the chief deity of Locri. These reports provided fodder for Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, nearing the end of his life, in his opposition to Scipio and his \\"Greek\\" way of life in Sicily and his plans to invade Africa. The Locrians, however, diverted any blame to Pleminius.Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 174; Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders, pp. 77 and 83‚Äì84; Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 274. The legal case The senate sent a ten-man commission headed by Marcus Pomponius Matho to investigate,Livy 29.20‚Äì22; Diodorus 27.4; Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 274. along with two tribunes of the plebs and an aedile. Matho was the praetor and propraetor assigned to Sicily from 204 to 202 BC, and had been authorized to recall Scipio if necessary, but the commission had no judicial powers.Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders, pp. 77 and 232, note 33. Its size was virtually unprecedented, and reflects both the importance of the case and its ultimate target: Scipio, not merely Pleminius. The difficulty and delicacy of Matho's position should not be underestimated; the legal question was whether a high-level magistrate should be held responsible for actions committed by an officer to whom he had delegated imperium on his own authority. Since Matho's own imperium was inferior to that of Scipio, there was a risk that if charged and found guilty, the proconsul would ignore the praetor and simply exit the province to pursue his African venture.Brennan, Praetorship, p. 141. Scipio, however, dazzled the commission,Bagnall, Punic Wars, p. 274. while Pleminius was left to take the fall for plundering the Temple of Proserpina and murdering the tribunes Publius Matienus and Marcus Sergius.Livy 29.6‚Äì9, 16‚Äì22; Diodorus Siculus 27.4; Valerius Maximus 1.1.21; see also Appian, Hannibalic Wars 55 and Zonaras 9.11. The legates were able to report that Pleminius had acted neither on Scipio's orders nor according to his wishes (neque iussu neque voluntate).Livy 29.21.10, perhaps a legal formula; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 142. =Questions of arrest and exile= Versions of Pleminius's arrest vary. Livy reports two. In one, Pleminius fled when he heard about the investigation, and attempted to go into exile at Naples. He was captured en route by the legate Quintus Caecilius Metellus, the consul of 206 BC. Alternatively, Livy says, Scipio himself sent his own legate and an elite squadron of cavalry to arrest Pleminius and turned him over to the commission.Livy 29.21.1‚Äì3; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 142. Diodorus reports only the second version that ameliorates Scipio's conduct, but has Scipio summoning Pleminius to Sicily, throwing him in chains, then handing him over to the two plebeian tribunes sent with the commission, who were duly impressed by this firm response. Pleminius was later shipped off to Rome and imprisoned, but died before his trial concluded.Livy 29.22.7‚Äì9; Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders, p. 78; Brennan, Praetorship, p. 142. The charge would have been perduellio, a capital crime, most likely to be brought before the centuriate assembly.Vishnia, State, Society, and Popular Leaders, p. 78. What was unusual, and perhaps unprecedented at the time, was the arrest of a man who held delegated imperium. If it's correct that Pleminius chose to become a fugitive, by Roman law he had deserted his post and would be considered an exile. The choice of exile to escape sentencing in a capital crime brought with it a loss of citizenship. The complexities of the case may account for the proliferating versions,Brennan, Praetorship, p. 142. and the potential legal status of Pleminius is of interest in documenting the use of exile in ancient Rome.Gordon P. Kelly, A History of Exile in the Roman Republic, (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 164‚Äì165. The case of sacrilege at Locri was a precedent in the investigation of an incident involving the same temple only a short time later, conducted by the praetor Quintus Minucius Rufus in 200 BC: see Minucius Rufus: Praetorship in Locri.A.H. MacDonald, \\"Rome and the Italian Confederation (200‚Äì86 B.C.),\\" Journal of Roman Studies 34 (1944), p. 14, note 23. Imprisonment, attempted escape, and execution Livy reports that Pleminius, still imprisoned in 194 BC, organized a number of men to cover his escape by setting fire to various points in Rome. This was to take place during the Sacred Games. The plot was betrayed and reported to the Senate; Pleminius was put to death.Livy 34.44 See also * Pleminia (gens) Selected bibliography *Bagnall, Nigel.

Geoffrey de Runcey (1340s?‚Äì1384) was a 14th century chronicler and abbey servant who wrote a valuable, although now-incomplete journal of his travels around medieval East Anglia. Little is known about de Runcey's ancestry, but his name suggests that he originated from North Runcton, now in the town of King's Lynn in Norfolk, \\"Runcey\\" being an archaic spelling (see also Oxburgh Hall at Oxborough). It has been speculated that he was the son of a landowner, free tenant, or even the illegitimate son of a priest, as despite not being ordained he was educated at Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and was in service with the monastery for the rest of his life.Tim Wells, Biography and excerpts at the Geoffrey de Runcey Society, retrieved 26 November 2006 He is best known for his Chronicle from circa 1379. De Runcey appears to have been sent by the priory to spread the news of the death of the high abbot of Bury around the Benedictine monasteries of East Anglia, in the process coming into contact with many walks of life. The chronicle was likely to have been written as evidence that the task was accomplished. He died in 1384, although the cause of death is not recorded. He was interred at the priory of St Edmund, in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, although his tomb was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\\"Houses of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Bury St Edmunds\\" in A History of the County of Suffolk: Volume 2 (1975), pp. 56-72\\"The Abbey of Bury St. Edmund's\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) The Chronicle Portion of the chronicle manuscript.Montague Williams, Geoffrey de Runcey Society Newsletter, volume 4 (Reydon, 1983), p.8.

It was a decisive defeat for the Welsh because their leader, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was killed, and this effectively ended the autonomy of Wales. Background of the War Llywelyn had already fought a war against Edward I of England in 1277. Edward had organised a large full-time army with which he overran all North Wales as far west as the Conwy River, and a fleet with which he captured Anglesey, depriving the Welsh of much of their grain. Llywelyn was forced to come to humiliating terms, and ceded large areas of Wales to England. Over the five years which followed, there was continued tension between Llywelyn and Edward over various lawsuits, and increasing unrest between the Welsh people and their English administrators in the newly transferred areas. The revolt was actually begun in 1282 by Llywelyn's brother Dafydd, who had sided with Edward five years earlier but now captured Hawarden Castle and slaughtered its garrison. This was followed by uprisings in many parts of Wales, and Llywelyn declared war on Edward on behalf of all Welsh. Campaign up to December Edward repeated his tactics of the previous war, laboriously occupying North Wales as far as the Vale of Conwy and occupying Anglesey, while sending armies into southern and central Wales to overawe or subdue Llewelyn's allies and potential supporters. At the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr the English army attacking south Wales was ambushed and destroyed by the southern Welsh. On 6 November, Edward's lieutenant in Anglesey, Luke de Tany, launched a premature attack across a bridge of boats which spanned the Menai Strait. His force was ambushed, cut off and slaughtered at the Battle of Moel-y-don. These unexpected reverses undoubtedly set Edward back several months. He was forced to pause to raise fresh armies and supplies. Llywelyn took advantage of the respite by making an expedition into mid-Wales, to inspire and rally support. This was the territory nominally ruled by Marcher Lords, who enjoyed considerable independence from Edward. Some were wavering and prepared to support Llywelyn. However, three of them, Roger l'Estrange, John Giffard and Edmund Mortimer were staunch supporters of Edward, and were in the field in mid-Wales with an army consisting mainly of archers from Shropshire and some heavy cavalry, as well as troops donated to them by the Welsh lord Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, who was an old enemy of Llywelyn. The English are thought to have had an army consisting of around 5000 infantrymen and 1300 heavy cavalry. The battle On 11 December, Llywelyn's army occupied a hillside north of the Irfon River near the village of Cilmeri, placed to repel any attack from the south across Orewin Bridge. The army is thought to have consisted of a few thousand spearmen and javelinmen from North Wales, with some men-at-arms from Llywelyn's own teulu (household), and some local archers from Brecon (who had betrayed their former English allies and joined Llywelyn, having been disappointed in the English failure at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr). Altogether, the army is thought to have added up to around 7000 infantry and 160 Cavalry (Llywelyn's Teulu). Llywelyn himself was not present, having gone to speak with local leaders (possibly at Builth Castle). A local inhabitant had told the Marchers about a ford across the Irfon two miles downstream, near its confluence with the River Wye, and they sent most of their archers across it to attack the Welsh in the flank. The Welsh army turned to face them, and the English mounted men-at-arms charged across the now undefended bridge. Meanwhile, the English archers shot into the Welsh spear schiltrons, weakening and disorganising the troops. The English heavy cavalry then charged the rear of the army. The leaderless and demoralised Welsh were routed. As the Welsh army fled, Llywelyn returned in haste. On the outskirts of the fighting, he was attacked and cut down by an English man-at-arms named Stephen de Frankton, an English centenar from Ellesmere, Shropshire. Aftermath Llywelyn's body was not recognised until the next day (he had probably gone in secret or incognito to his meeting, and would therefore not have worn any surcoat or other heraldic device). His head was cut off, and taken to London to be exhibited. He left only an infant daughter, Gwenllian of Wales. Leadership of the Welsh fell to Dafydd, who led a guerrilla resistance for some months but was soon betrayed, captured and executed as a traitor. Edward was able to formally end the existence of an organised resistance to English rule in the Welsh regions.

The storyline builds upon the events that developed in previous Marvel storylines, particularly \\"Avengers Disassembled\\", \\"House of M\\", and \\"Decimation\\". The tagline for the series is, \\"Whose Side Are You On?\\" The plot of the series follows a framework story line in which the U.S. government passes a Superhero Registration Act, ostensibly designed to have super powered individuals act under official regulation, somewhat akin to law enforcement. However, superheroes opposed to the act, led by Captain America, find themselves in conflict with those supporting the act, led by Iron Man, with Spider-Man caught in the middle; the X-Men take a neutral stance. The superheroes in support of the law, such as Iron Man, Mister Fantastic and Ms. Marvel, become increasingly authoritarian. The conflict between freedom and security is an underlying theme in the story line, with real-life events and discussions, such as the U.S. government's increased surveillance of its citizens, serving as a backdrop for the events in Civil War. A sequel, Civil War II, debuted in June 2016. The series polarized critics but it was a commercial success. The 2016 film Captain America: Civil War in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was made as a loose adaptation of the same storyline.  Publication history  The premise of \\"Civil War\\" involves the introduction of a Superhuman Registration Act in the United States. Mark Millar, writer for the story, has said: The act requires any person in the United States with superhuman abilities to register with the federal government as a \\"human weapon of mass destruction,\\" reveal their true identity to the authorities and then undergo proper training. Those who sign also have the option of working for S.H.I.E.L.D., earning a salary and benefits such as those earned by other American civil servants. Characters within the superhero community in the Marvel Universe split into two groups: one advocating the registration as a responsible obligation, and the other opposing the law on the grounds that it violates civil liberties and the protection that secret identities provide. While arguing directly with Iron Man about the law, Luke Cage (previously the second Power Man), an African American, compared the mandatory registration to slavery. A number of villains have also chosen to take sides, some choosing to side with the registration, others against it. Writer Mark Millar signing copies of the collectors edition of the main miniseries during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan = Delays = Marvel announced in August 2006 that some issues of the main Civil War series would be pushed back several months to accommodate artist Steve McNiven. The schedule had issue #4 being released one month late, in September, while issue #5 was released two months later, in November. Furthermore, various tie-in books including the Civil War: Front Line miniseries and tie-in issues of other comics were delayed several months so as not to reveal any plot developments. In late November 2006, Marvel announced another delay. Civil War #6, originally scheduled for release on December 20, was pushed back two weeks and released on January 4. Unlike the previous instance, only The Punisher War Journal #2 was delayed. In a final act of rescheduling, Civil War #7 was pushed back two weeks (from January 17 to January 31), and then pushed back again until February 21. = Behind the scenes = After the publication of Civil War #7, Mark Millar was interviewed by Newsarama and described the event as \\"a story where a guy wrapped in the American flag is in chains as the people swap freedom for security\\", agreeing that a \\"certain amount of political allegory\\" was present but that the real focus of the book was on superheroes fighting each other. Contrasting it with The Ultimates, Millar stated that Civil War was \\"accidentally political because I just cannot help myself.\\"  Plot  The New Warriors (Night Thrasher, Namorita, Speedball, and Microbe) battle a group of villains (Cobalt Man, Speedfreek, Coldheart, and Nitro) in Stamford, Connecticut while filming a reality television show. Nitro explodes, killing more than 600 people (including school children and all of the New Warriors except Speedball). The rest of the superheroes appear in Stamford to search for survivors. Public opinion turns against superhumans. Even the inactive members of the New Warriors are branded as \\"baby killers\\". Hindsight (desperate to distance himself from the team) releases their secret identities online, and several are attacked. She-Hulk forces Hindsight to shut down the site, and Hindsight is arrested by John Jameson. Angry civilians attack the Human Torch outside a club. Guided by Iron Man, Congress quickly passes the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA), 6 U.S.C. ¬ß 558,Civil War #1 requiring the registration of all persons with superhuman abilities with the U.S. government, and the enlistment and training of those wishing to operate as superheroes. The law applies to those with naturally-occurring superhuman abilities, those humans using exotic technology (such as Iron Man), or anyone who wants to challenge the superhumans.Black Panther Enactment of the federal law led to revisions of state criminal codes.Flamini, Anthony & Byrd, Ronald; Civil War Battle Damage Report; March 2007; Page 1 Captain America refuses to join a S.H.I.E.L.D. strike force hunting superhumans in violation of the act, and is attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s \\"Cape-Killers\\", even though the act has not been passed yet. Afterwards, he becomes a fugitive and forms an underground resistance movement calling itself the \\"Secret Avengers\\". This team includes Hercules, Falcon, Danny Rand (who is acting as Daredevil in Matt Murdock's place),Civil War #2 Luke Cage, and the Young Avengers.New Avengers #22 Iron Man, Reed Richards, Hank Pym (actually a Skrull in disguise), and She-Hulk come down in favor of the act. Spider-Man unmasks at a press conference as a show of support for the act. Doctor Strange wants no part of the act and tells Iron Man and Mister Fantastic that they are never to call on him again (the government declares Doctor Strange exempt from the act). The government-backed heroes track down unregistered superhumans and subsequently detain or register them. Captain America's Secret Avengers and Iron Man's Avengers end up fighting in Yancey Street. The Thing, who was only visiting the old neighborhood, gets roped into crowd control. However, when a young member of the Yancy Street Gang is killed in the violence that ensues, Grimm, disgusted with both sides, leaves the country for France. The Secret Avengers, responding to a false emergency, are lured into an ambush by the pro- registration forces. As the battle turns against them, a new weapon is brought into play: Project Lightning, a cyborg clone of Thor (created from a few strands of the Asgardian's hair and empowered by a technological copy of Mjolnir). Confronted by Bill Foster, \\"Thor\\" sends a bolt of lightning through the hero's chest, killing him. With both sides in shock, Cap orders a retreat. Sue Storm shelters the re-grouping Secret Avengers under an energy shield, allowing their escape. Bill Foster's death shakes up both sides: Stature and Nighthawk surrender and register, while the Human Torch and Invisible Woman oppose the act. In turn, Pym drafts a sub-group of the Thunderbolts to their cause.Civil War #4 Spider-Man demands to see the concentration camp-styled prison facilities \\"42\\" in the Negative Zone.Amazing Spider-Man #535 He concludes that he has made a mistake by siding with Stark and attempts to defect from Iron Man's side but is confronted by Iron Man and, after a brief battle, escapes. Against Iron Man's will, he is hunted down and badly beaten by the Jester III and Jack O'Lantern of the new Thunderbolts. The Punisher saves Spider-Man by killing the two villains, and carries him to a Secret Avengers safe-house. After recovering from his injuries, Spider-Man joins Cap's forces,Civil War #5 and makes a public statement in which he pledges to fight the Registration Act. The Punisher seeks to join Captain America's forces, pointing out that Iron Man's decision to employ infamous mass murderers as enforcers of the act is what has motivated the vigilante to come out of hiding, although crime is at an all-time low as a result of the registered heroes. Captain America reluctantly accepts Punisher's offer of help. As the Punisher makes his way through the Baxter Building to retrieve plans for the Negative Zone prison, Sue Richards travels to Atlantis to persuade Namor to join the Secret Avengers, although he refuses. The supervillains Goldbug and Plunderer arrive at the Secret Avengers' base to join Captain America's team, but the Punisher immediately kills them, leading Captain America to attack him and kick him out of the group. While meditating, Doctor Strange speaks with Uatu the Watcher, who asks Strange why he doesn't use his immense power to end the conflict. Doctor Strange informs Uatu that the Sorcerer Supreme has no business in mankind's internal struggles, but promises to pray for an outcome that will benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood. As the final battle begins Cloak teleports the combatants to New York City, where Namor and an army of Atlanteans arrive to fight alongside the Secret Avengers and the Champions, the Thor clone, and Captain Marvel reinforce Stark's team. Mister Fantastic saves Invisible Woman from a bullet launched by Taskmaster, and Hercules destroys the Thor clone. The Thing returns to protect the citizens from harm. As Captain America is about to deliver a final blow to Iron Man, policemen, EMTs, and firefighters try to restrain him. Realizing how much damage the fight has already inflicted upon the very people he wishes to protect, Captain America surrenders and orders his team to stand down. = Aftermath = Here is what happened in the aftermath of the Superhero Civil War: * The President of the United States grants general amnesty to all opponents of the Superhuman Registration Act who turn themselves in or register *Captain America, the main opponent to the act, is arrested and subsequently assassinated by a brainwashed Sharon Carter. * Tony Stark is appointed director of S.H.I.E.L.D. while Maria Hill is demoted to deputy director. * The 50-State Initiative is set up to eventually place a superhero team in every state. * The Mighty Avengers assemble as a new team. * Some heroes choose to leave the country rather than submit. In Canada the third Omega Flight is gathered; Firestar retires; and several heroes remain underground, including the New Avengers:Civil War #7 Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (actually the Skrull Queen Veranke), Iron Fist, Doctor Strange, Ronin (actually a resurrected Clint Barton), Echo, and Wolverine. * Spider- Man's identity of Peter Parker is now known causing J. Jonah Jameson to sue. * Goliath, Bantam, Typeface, and Stilt-Man have been killed during the conflict. Tom Foster continues his uncle's legacy, becoming the new Goliath. * An assassin hired by Kingpin misses Spider-Man, but strikes the \\"secondary target\\" of Aunt May. The attack on Aunt May ultimately leads to Spider-Man striking a deal with Mephisto to save her life while \\"rewriting history\\" and erasing Peter Parker's marriage to Mary Jane Watson from continuity. * Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman take a break from the Fantastic Four to work on their marriage and are replaced by Black Panther and Storm. * Captain Marvel enters the present day. * Speedball's powers (and sanity) are drastically altered, and he becomes the new Penance, a member of the Thunderbolts. * A reconstituted version of the New Warriors emerges, (bearing little resemblance to the original); most of the former Warriors are a part of The Initiative Program. * Nova returns to Earth (after destroying Annihilus and thwarting its annihilation wave with the Nova Corps Worldmind in him). He finds out that his former teammates on the New Warriors are dead and has to decide whether or not to be on The Initiative as he battles the Thunderbolts. He chooses to leave Earth, heading for the Kree space.  Other versions  = Amazing Spider- Man: Renew Your Vows = When the Super-Human Registration Act was proposed, Professor X and the Avengers proposed an alternative method with self-policing of mutantkind and super-powered communities, preventing Civil War from ever happening. Cyclops thought it was preposterous for Professor X to make himself the self-appointed representative of mutantkind, and his opposition to Xavier's proposal led Jean Grey to break up with him and marry Wolverine.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows (vol. 2) #6 = Contest of Champions = The 2015 Contest of Champions series featured an alternate version of Civil War that had everything go in Tony Stark's favor. Five years after the war, Tony becomes the President of the United States and leads the Mighty Avengers as the Iron Patriot. His team consists of Penance (Robbie Baldwin), Iron Spider (Natasha Romanoff), Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), and the Thor clone known as Thunderstrike. Steve Rogers (no longer called Captain America) and his teammates have been arrested and buy time off their sentence by performing suicide missions as the Thunderbolts. Steve's team consists of Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Invisible Woman, the Punisher, and Bill Foster's Goliath (who survived the Civil War in this reality). President Stark and his Mighty Avengers are taken to Battleworld by Maestro and have their memories altered to think that they are on Earth and that the Renegade Champions already there are unregistered vigilantes. The Thunderbolts are sent to rescue them, but misunderstandings result in the deaths of Penance and Thunderstrike and all three teams start fighting each other. Tony kills Steve and reveals that he is in the possession of the Reality Gem from the Infinity Gauntlet. Tony and the members of the Illuminati divided the six Infinity Stones after hunting them down and vowed never to use them. But when Tony let the events of Civil War happen in their natural course, he couldn't resist using the Reality Gem to alter events in his favor. He used the gem to prevent the deaths of Goliath and Captain America, win the war, and rig the presidential election. He attempts to use it again to undo his killing of Steve, but it does not work since they were in another dimension. Maestro kills Tony and the Punisher, but is stopped by the intervention of Stick, the Sentry, and Nigel Higgins using the Iso-Sphere. The remaining five heroes from the Mighty Avengers and Thunderbolts stay behind on Battleworld with the Sentry and fight villains attempting to gather the Iso-Sphere as the Civil Warriors.Contest of Champions (2015) #9-10 = Earth-3490 = When Mister Fantastic was researching realities where the Civil War ended differently, he found one reality in which their version of Anthony Stark was a woman named Natasha Stark. The Civil War was avoided entirely in this reality due to her marriage to Steve Rogers, by deterring each other's more aggressive behaviour and allowing Reed Richards to complete the Super Hero Registration Program.Dark Reign: Fantastic Four #2 = Spider-Man: Life Story = In a reality where all the characters age naturally after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962, the Superhuman Registration Act was passed shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and lasted for years. As a result, most of the heroes are middle-aged and older. In 2006, Ben Reilly (who was publicly known as Peter Parker/Spider-Man) was murdered by Morlun, prompting the real Peter Parker to return to New York to reveal he's alive to draw Morlun out to him and prevent Stark from taking control of Parker Industries. When Peter refuses Stark's offer to register, he is attacked by the U.S. Avengers (consisting of Tony Stark/Iron Man, James Rhodes/War Machine, Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk, and Danny Rand/Iron Fist all wearing power armors) before he is assisted by the Anti-Registration Avengers (consisting of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Luke Cage, Tyrone Johnson/Cloak and Tandy Bowen/Dagger). Peter dons a new Spider-Man armor and defeats the U.S. Avengers with a device that exposes a fail-safe Tony placed inside all of their armors. After Tony is revealed to be a hologram and disappears, Spider-Man joins the Anti-Registration Avengers to follow his daughter's advice on leaving the world a better place for future generations. Spider-Man: Life Story #5: Our Civic Engagement, Chip Zdarsky, Marvel Comics A decade later, it is revealed that Dr. Doom took over the planet as the heroes were too busy fighting each other (a reference to the 2015 Secret Wars). Peter becomes the new leader of the resistance after all the other heroes died or disappeared from the public.Spider-Man: Life Story #6: All My Enemies, Chip Zdarsky, Marvel Comics = Spider-Verse = During an attempt by the reality- displaced Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) to reach back to his dimension as seen in the Spider-Verse storyline, he discovered an alternate dimension where a Civil War Iron Spider-Man lies dead (killed by Karn) prompting him to continue investigating the murders of Spider-Men throughout the Multiverse.Superior Spider-Man #32 = What If? = In What If Civil War Ended Differently?, a stranger appears in front of Iron Man, who is visiting Captain America's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. Tony Stark is told of two alternate ways the Civil War could have concluded:What If?: Civil War #1 * The first is detailed in, \\"What if Captain America led all the heroes against the Registration Act?\\" In this reality, Tony Stark dies of the Extremis virus, leaving the U.S. government to choose Steve Rogers as the spokesperson for heroes, who, as in the regular universe, opposes the Registration Act. Though he manages to delay its passing, the Stamford disaster occurs as in Earth-616. Without Tony to provide a fairer path for registration, the government's response is more extreme. Government forces led by Henry Peter Gyrich destroy the resistance and many heroes are slain. Faced with this vision, Tony believes that this proves that he was right to pursue his pro-registration course of action, but the stranger then reveals another possibility; * The second is detailed in, \\"What if Iron Man lost the Civil War?\\" In this reality, Iron Man asks for Cap's help during the confrontation at the power plant instead of threatening him, admitting his doubts about his actions rather than trying to justify them, and thus Cap does not use the hidden weapon in his glove to disable Tony's armor. The heroes then unite to defeat the out-of-control Thor clone, Ragnarok, which is released when a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent detects the weapon and assumes that Cap is still planning to use it. The resulting goodwill convinces Captain America to help run the program as he is the only one the heroes will trust with their secret identities. The stranger is revealed to be Uatu, Earth 616's Watcher. Upon learning of the possibility of this alternate reality, Tony is devastated and weeps for the bright future he helped prevent. In What If: Annihilation by David Hine and Mico Suayan, the cosmic Annihilation War reaches Earth during the War. The heroes unite to neutralize it, and many die in the first clashes. Captain America and Iron Man, after a final reconciliation, sacrifice themselves alongside Nova to deflect the full Annihilation Wave.Annihilation Makes Things Civil: Hine talks \\"What If? Annihilation\\", Comic Book Resources, October 5, 2007  Civil War in Secret Wars (2015)  The \\"Civil War\\" storyline is featured in the 2015 storyline \\"Secret Wars\\", a crossover storyline, which revisits previous Marvel Comics storylines in the form of isolated geographic locations on a planet called Battleworld. The \\"Civil War\\" area is referred to as the Warzone. In this story, the Stamford incident leads to a polarising political debate that culminates with the two sides clashing in the Negative Zone Prison. During the fight, Black Panther hacks into the prison's computers and sees that the portal will explode, killing most of the combatants and stranding the rest. Black Panther assumes that Stark will teleport his combatants out at the last minute, but meanwhile, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Maria Hill tells Stark that Black Panther activated the explosives on the orders of Steve Rogers. Deactivating the teleportation device, Black Panther tries to shut down the bomb. Everyone in the prison rushes to escape through the power of the hero Cloak, who drops them all in midair over St. Louis. Unfortunately, Cloak can not shut off his powers fast enough to block out the explosion. The resulting beam of explosive energy creates a vast chasm called the Divide, destroying St. Louis and leaving millions dead. The two sides regroup, with the Pro-Registration group taking control of the land to the east of St Louis, while the Anti-Registration group takes control of the land to the west. Each side blames the other for the deaths. The East became \\"the Iron\\", run by Tony Stark, and The West became \\"The Blue\\", run by Captain America. Differences in politics have caused people to pick one side over the other, with the split ossifying every year. The only place in the country that embraces both is a community in the ruins of St. Louis, built on a bridge over the Divide. One of its inhabitants is Miriam Sharpe, a woman who lost her child at Stamford but who wants to bring peace. Six years after the start of the conflict, Sharpe brings the two leaders together to discuss peace. At the meeting, Miriam is able to get the two men to open up. Stark explains that the Iron has wealth and resources from trade with the outside world where the Blue is regarded as a rogue state. However, his citizens are running out of space while the Blue has twice the space but half the population. He proposes that the Blue shrink, giving his people more space in exchange for which Stark will make trade concessions. General Rogers dismisses the offer, which leads to the start of an old debate between the two men. As Miriam Sharpe tries to intervene, she is shot in the back by a sniper. Reacting first, General Rogers calls Peter Parker to catch the shooter. Parker finds a remote-controlled sniper rifle. As Miriam dies, General Rogers realizes that from the angle of the shot that the shooter was most likely aiming at him. President Stark denies the shooter is one of his, but renewed civil war seemed inevitable.Civil War Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics. President Stark sends a drone to track the killers, but it is shot down and its datacore claimed by the Blue. President Stark discovers certain anomalies regarding past events, leading him to believe that events like Sharpe's murder were caused by a third party. Meanwhile, Hank McCoy shows Rogers the results of \\"Project Bellcurve\\", a procedure capable of depowering superhumans. Numerous resources from the Iron are needed to continue the project, for which Rogers sends a team composed of Parker, Elektra, Azari, and Venom/Clint Barton to infiltrate Stark's territory. At the same time, Stark sends Jennifer Walters to infiltrate the Blue and continue investigating Sharpe's murder.Civil War Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics. Spider-Man's team suffers the first casualty when a Stark Sentinel kills Elektra. The team manages to overcome the rest of the defenses (including the reanimated corpse of the Kingpin controlled by Doctor Octopus' tentacles) thanks to Venom, and return to the Blue with the components needed for \\"Project Bellcurve.\\" At the same time, She-Hulk had been able to infiltrate Steeltown. However, Agent Robbie Baldwin of the Punishers recognizes her and follows She-Hulk. She discovers the assassin was Bullseye. Baldwin attacks Jen as she is spying on Bullseye, and is forced to flee. Before she can leave Steeltown, she is knocked out by an unidentified attacker. She-Hulk awakes in an undisclosed location having been captured by Bullseye's client Black Panther.Civil War Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics. As the Blue prepare to invade the Iron in a last-ditch attempt at ending the war, Iron Man tracks down Jen's position and flies to rescue her. He finds her, but his armor is neutralized and stripped from him. Tony is brought to Black Panther who reveals himself as the Skrull Queen Veranke. Veranke tells him that she is the cause of every single failed attempt at reaching peace in a part of a plan to benefit from the never-ending war. Iron Man uses additional weaponry that was not in his armor to free himself, fend off the Skrull guards, and break She-Hulk free from her cage. Meanwhile, the Blue invade the Iron while General America prepares to detonate a bomb derived from Project Bellcurve.Civil War Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics. As the conflict escalates, Iron Man is able to reach General America and reveal that Bucky is a Skrull, prompting General America to accept a telepathic 'update' from Emma Frost that confirms that the Skrulls have manipulated the conflict for years. Accepting their mutual responsibility for the situation, Rogers and Stark sacrifice themselves to detonate the Bellcurve bomb. The blast depowers the superhumans and reverts the Skrulls to their true state. A few months later, a powerless Peter and Jennifer are shown discussing the tentative truce that has been formed between the two sides, and wonder whether Stark and Rogers knew that peace would be the result of their sacrifice.Civil War Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.  Civil War II (2016)  A direct sequel to the original series debuted in June 2016, written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by David Marquez. Unlike the previous story and the film, the conflict in this storyline is not about issues of government registration; A new Inhuman, Ulysses emerges with the ability to see predictions about the future, resulting in conflict emerging between heroes led by Iron Man and Captain Marvel respectively, Stark favoring self-determination and concerned about the prospects of coming to depend on the visions while Danvers feels that his visions represent a potentially valuable asset.  Reception  At the time of its release, Civil War received mixed reviews. Comic Book Round Up gave the series an average rating of 6.5. According to a scholarly analysis presented at the 2007 Comic-Con International, this story's conflict is a natural outgrowth of what psychologist Erich Fromm called \\"the basic human dilemma\\", the conflicting desires for both security and freedom, and \\"character motivations on both sides arise from positive human qualities because Fromm's image of human nature is ultimately optimistic, holding that people on either side are struggling to find what is best for all\\". However, over time, Civil War has become more well received. IGN ranked it as one of the greatest Comic Book Events.

In issue #3, Iron Man reminds Sersi to register. In issue #6, Iron Man and Hank Pym try to get the Eternals to register again, but they refuse. In the end, Zuras explains that the Eternals have no desire to meddle with humanity, and will stay out of their affairs, which Iron Man concedes as a fair compromise. * Daredevil #87 leads into Civil War: Choosing Sides (one-shot). * New X-Men #28 and She-Hulk #9 are indirectly, but strongly involved. * In Black Panther #19-20 \\"World Tour\\" Black Panther meets with Doctor Doom, then the Inhumans, to discuss the Civil War (these are not listed as official tie-ins due to a marketing error). * Marvel Comics Presents (vol. 2) #12 involves a patsy attempt to get Man-Thing to register with the government. The story was published late (October 2008 cover date), during Secret Invasion and the same month as Marvel Zombies 3, in which Man-Thing also appeared. * The cover of Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. #11 features a Civil War parody cover including a plaid background, the words \\"Not part of a Marvel Comics event,\\" and Aaron Stack holding up a card reading \\"Mark Millar licks goats.\\" * Spider-Man and Power Pack #3 (March 2007) includes a parody entitled \\"Civil Wards,\\" written by Marc Sumerak and illustrated by Chris Giarrusso. * The final issue of Robert Kirkman's Marvel Team-Up opens with Peter Parker getting ready to travel to Washington with Iron Man. * The third issue of the 2006 Union Jack miniseries also mentions Tony Stark and Peter Parker's trip to Washington. * Incredible Hulk #100 includes a 12-page backup story dealing with Mr. Fantastic's involvement with the Thor clone, and the repercussions of the Illuminati having exiled the Hulk into space. * In Annihilation #4, the former Earth hero Nova is aware of the Civil War and is disappointed with the actions the heroes have taken, as they are not united against the threat of Annihilus. * In Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #6-10, Spider-Man is seen wearing the new suit he got in The Road to Civil War. * In Sensational Spider-Man #26-27, Spider-Man is seen wearing the new suit he got in The Road to Civil War. * In Sensational Spider-Man #28-34, Spider-Man deals with the aftermath of revealing his identity. * Captain America (5th ed.) #25 is subtitled Civil War Epilogue. * Punisher: War Journal (2nd ed.) #2 and #3 are direct Civil War tie ins (prior to Civil War #6. * Moon Knight (5th ed.) #8 and #9 are direct Civil War tie ins. * Civil War: Front Lines #9-11 are direct Civil War tie ins. = Collected editions =       In other media  = Novels = Marvel adapted Civil War into a prose hardcover novel in July 2012 as the first of a series of four novels adapting some of Marvel's most significant fictional events. It was written by Stuart Moore, the writer of Namor: The First Mutant. The book expanded on the story and set the events during Barack Obama's first term in office, rather than George W. Bush's last term; Tony Stark makes reference to the Affordable Care Act when speaking to Spider-Man in the first chapter of the novel. The novel is set in the alternate timeline created by the controversial storyline \\"One More Day\\" and detailed in \\"One Moment in Time\\", as Spider-Man is depicted as never having married Mary Jane Watson, having never arrived on the day of their wedding. In the original comics version, Civil War was a lead-in to \\"One More Day\\", depicting May Parker's assassination on the orders of Wilson Fisk near the end of the main Civil War storyline. = Film = The 2016 film Captain America: Civil War was a cinematic treatment of the story, albeit focusing more on the issue of government control rather than public knowledge of secret identities, matters also being escalated by the interference and manipulation of Helmut Zemo as his plan for revenge for the Avengers' role in Ultron's assault and the deaths of Zemo's family. The movie version of Civil War also differs from the comic substantially, with the fate of Bucky Barnes being a key element of the war after he is framed for the assassination of the Black Panther's father, the king of Wakanda. As in the comics, Captain America and Iron Man are the respective leaders of the anti-registration and pro-registration sides of the conflicts, with Cap's side including the Falcon, Bucky, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, and the Scarlet Witch, and Iron Man's side being Black Widow, War Machine, the Black Panther, Spider-Man and the Vision. Stark and Rogers reconcile after realizing the truth of the king's assassination, but it is short lived as Zemo reveals Barnes' role in Stark's parents' deaths, and that Rogers kept the truth from him. Stark angrily attacks both Rogers and Barnes, and the fight culminates with Rogers abandoning his shield and identity. The film concludes with Cap's side seeking asylum in Wakanda after the Black Panther recognizes that he was wrong to target Bucky. The latter is then put in a cryogenetic sleep. Black Widow goes on the run, and War Machine is left crippled after injuries sustained in the final battle. = Television = A different variation of the Civil War storyline closely resembling Civil War II as it features Iron Man and Captain Marvel in opposition to each other was adapted in the four-part Season finale of Avengers: Ultron Revolution. In this version of the storyline, the Registration Act targets new Inhumans, and teams of Avengers come into conflict over the issue, as in other adaptations. It is revealed in Part 3, however, that the Inhuman Registration Act is actually part of a plan by Ultron (disguised as Truman Marsh) to begin the Ultron Revolution by manipulating humans and Inhumans into destroying each other, which is foiled by the combined efforts of the Avengers. = Video games = * The comic is adapted into Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2. While the storyline remains relatively faithful to the original comic, it takes a different path halfway through the game, as the act is briefly suspended for the heroes to deal with a crisis involving the nanite network used to control supervillains manifesting a form of sentience. In the game, the player gets to choose whether to side with Pro or Anti-Registration- with Captain America, Luke Cage and Iron Fist 'locked' into Anti-Registration and Iron Man, Mister Fantastic and Songbird in Pro-Registration- which affects the story's progression, characters they interact with, and the story's ending. * In Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Iron Man and Captain America reference the event if they are pitted against each other. The player also receives an achievement titled \\"Whose Side are You On?\\" if Iron Man defeats Captain America or vice versa in an online match. * In Marvel: Contest of Champions, a special storyline featured elements of the Civil War, as the apparent death of the Collector causes Iron Man and Captain America to become divided over what action they should take with the Iso-Spheres that must be collected in the game. This storyline also introduces a special player in the form of the Civil Warrior, who is identified as a version of Steve Rogers who witnessed so much death in the final battle of the Civil War that he adopted some of Tony Stark's armor and dedicated himself to preventing such a catastrophe ever again.

He was also chief of the Clan Cathcart. Biography The son of Charles Cathcart, 8th Lord Cathcart, and Marion Shaw, he was born on 21 March 1721. Opposed to the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, he became an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Cumberland and during the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745, was shot in the face. Joshua Reynolds' portrait (1753‚Äì55) shows the black silk patch he used to cover the scar on his cheek. This seemingly earned him the soubriquet 'Patch Cathcart'. The following year at the Battle of Culloden, again acting as ADC to Cumberland, Cathcart was once more wounded in battle. Charles was the last Lord Cathcart to inherit the family estate of Sundrum. Upon inheriting his mother's estates in Greenock he sold Sundrum to James Murray of Broughton in 1758. In 1763 he was created a Knight of the Order of the Thistle. In February 1768 he was appointed ambassador at St Petersburg and was well received by Catherine the Great. He served at the Russian court until 1772. On his return to Britain he was elected Rector of Glasgow University in 1773. He died on 14 August 1776. Personal life and children Bust of his daughter Mary.

The original store has closed but two retail locations in Manhattan and locations at JFK Airport and LaGuardia Airport are currently open daily. Before closing in January 2012, the original store and bakery had been the largest bagel manufacturer in New York City. H&H; Bagels continues to be one of the largest bagel manufacturers in New York City with their four retail/catering locations, a global wholesale business, and a nationwide shipping business. There is an H&H; Bagels at 1551 2nd Avenue between East 80th and East 81st streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a location at 526 Columbus Avenue between 85th and 86th streets on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and locations at JFK Airport and LaGuardia Airport. History View from Broadway The business was started in 1972 when Puerto Rican Helmer Toro and his brother-in-law Hector Hernandez (hence \\"H&H;\\"), bought Midtown Bagels at Broadway and 80th Street for $5,000 ($ in 2018 dollar terms) in cash and $50,000 ($ in 2018 dollar terms) in a loan. Toro eventually assumed full control of the business. In 1974 Toro opened H&H; Midtown Bagels East on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In 1979 H&H; went bankrupt for the first time which resulted in a new group taking over ownership of the Upper East Side H&H; location while Toro retained ownership of the Upper West Side location. In 1993 Toro moved his bakery to 46th Street at 12th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen, although his primary storefront remained on the Upper West Side. On December 18, 1997, NBC aired the Seinfeld episode entitled \\"The Strike,\\" in which Cosmo Kramer returns to work at H&H; Bagels after supposedly having been on strike for 12 years. He eventually strikes again, returns again, then is fired for dropping his gum into the bagel dough. The episode is also famous for introducing Frank Costanza's alternative holiday, \\"Festivus for the Rest of Us!\\" In addition to its retail locations, H&H; also ships bagels nationwide and supplies wholesale bagels globally. On November 18, 2009, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced the indictment and arrest of Helmer Toro for stealing, withholding taxes and evading unemployment insurance taxes. The indictment alleged that between July 2003 and April 2009, Toro failed to pay $369,000 withheld from H&H; employees. In May 2010 he pleaded guilty to grand larceny, and was sentenced to pay restitution of more than $540,000 and to a jail term, which he served over the course of 50 weekends from June 2010 to July 2011. Toro's portion of H&H; filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2011 in an effort to maintain its manufacturing facility in Secaucus, New Jersey,Rebecca Marx, \\"H&H; Bagels Will Close Its Iconic Upper West Side Store\\", Village Voice, June 21, 2011. but ultimately that facility was sold at auction in October 2011.

It also produces other foodstuffs such as canned salads. The owner is Manuel Guerreiro Ramirez. Profile and history As the first canned fished undertaking in the country, the VRSA plant is the cradle of the sector in Portugal. Applying the principle discovered by Nicholas Appert, and later drawn up into the theories of Pasteur, it revolutionised the concept of food conservation in Portugal. At the start of the last century exportation of products began and the first sardine steam ship was launched to sea, the Senhora da Encarna√ß√£o. With 250 employees, it has plants in Le√ßa da Palmeira and Peniche. It sells 40 million cans/year and exports 45% of its production, commercialised under its own brands. Internationalization Created in 1853 Ramirez is present in the Portuguese market and in 50 international markets with a range of 55 canned fish varieties and sixteen brands. Ramirez's internationalization process began at the end of the 19th century, creating brands such as Cocagne in the Benelux countries (exported since 1906). Tom√© in the Philippines, Canada, and the United States, Al-Fares in the Arab world, or Gabriel in South Africa is Ramirez brands. Exportation of Ramirez's canned fish products continues to grow in the markets of Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Brazil, England, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada, USA, Venezuela, Angola, Mozambique, Germany, Israel, Japan, China, and Australia. Quality certification Ramirez possesses its own laboratory and complies with the HACCP system. The Ramirez quality control system has been ratified by control departments such as the Canadian Fisheries Inspection Agency (CFIA), South African Bureau Standards (SABS), European Food Safety Inspection Service (EFSIS), Food and Drugs Administration (FDA of the USA). Ramirez has obtained the Quality Management System certification, governed by the NP EN ISO 9001:2000 standard, attributed by SGS, a quality certification services. Ramirez has become the first Portuguese canned fish company to be accredited by SGS. Healthy eating The Ramirez Nutrition Centre, CENUTRA, set up by Ramirez, with scientific support from the Faculty of Nutrition and Food Sciences (Faculdade de Ci√™ncias da Nutri√ß√£o e Alimenta√ß√£o) of Porto University, sponsors scientific research in health, nutrition and food sciences, especially geared towards canned fish and its benefits. The CENUTRA aims to seek scientific knowledge that will lead to a healthy diet and disseminate it among the community. The goal is to help to promote the Mediterranean diet. Canned sardines have a high content of proteins and also vitamins B1, B2, PP, calcium, phosphorus, iron and copper. The strategic importance of the sea As a sponsor of the ‚ÄúHypercluster do Mar‚Äù (Hypercluster of the Sea), RAMIREZ seeks through these synergies with the Porto Sea Life Center to raise awareness among the population of conservation of sea life.

Life Though the exact birth-date of Ariobarzanes is unknown, it is speculated that he was born around 368 BC. His sister was the ancient Persian noblewoman and warrior Youtab. Ariobarzanes was made satrap of Persis (the southern province of Fars in present-day Iran) in 335 BC by Darius III Codomannus. Historians are surprised that Darius III appointed a satrap for Persepolis and Persis; apparently that office did not previously exist. Ariobarzanes commanded part of the Persian Army fighting against the Macedonians at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. Death Following the Persian defeat at Gaugamela, Darius III realized he could not defend his capital Persepolis and travelled east to rebuild his armies, leaving Ariobarzanes in command. Meanwhile, Alexander the Great split his army and led his 14,000-strong force towards the Persian capital via the Persian Gates. There Ariobarzanes successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. The Persian success at the Battle of the Persian Gate was short lived though; after being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of Thermopylae. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Afterwards, Alexander continued towards Persepolis, seizing the city and its treasury, and eventually looting the city months after its fall. Alexander the Great replaced him with Phrasaortes as Hellenistic satrap of Persis.

Cauterets, France. A metal roof is a roofing system made from metal pieces or tiles characterized by its high resistance, impermeability and longevity. It is a component of the building envelope. Zinc, copper and steel alloys are commonly used. History Copper has played a significant role in architecture for thousands of years (see: copper in architecture). In the 3rd century B.C., copper roof shingles were installed atop the Lovamahapaya Temple in Sri Lanka.Seale, Wayne (2007). The role of copper, brass, and bronze in architecture and design; Metal Architecture, May 2007 The Romans used copper as roof covering for the Pantheon in 27 B.C.Copper roofing in detail; Copper in Architecture; Copper Development Association, U.K., www.cda.org.uk/arch Centuries later, copper and its alloys were integral in European medieval architecture. The copper roof of St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim, installed in 1280 A.D., survived until its destruction during bombings in World War II.Copper Roofing in Detail; Copper in Architecture; Copper Development Association, U.K., www.cda.org.uk/arch The roof at Kronborg, one of northern Europe's most important Renaissance castles (immortalized as Elsinore Castle in Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet) was installed in 1585 A.D.Kronborg completed; Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties, K√∏benhavn, The copper on the tower was renovated in 2009.Agency for Palaces and Cultural Properties, Renovation of the Tower of Christianborg Palace., Advantages Metal roofs can last up to 100 years, with installers providing 50 year warranties. Because of their longevity, most metal roofs are less expensive than asphalt shingles in the long term. Metal roofing can consist of a high percentage of recycled material and is 100% recyclable. It does not get as hot as asphalt, a common roofing material, and it reflects heat away from the building underneath in summertime. On a larger scale, its use reduces the heat island effect of cities when compared to asphalt. Coupled with its better insulating abilities, metal roofs can offer not only a 40% reduction in energy costs in the summer, but also up to a 15% reduction in the energy costs in the winter according to a 2008 Study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This finding is based on the use of a strapping system of four inches between the plywood and \\"cool-color\\" metal on top, which provides an air gap between the plywood roof sheathing and the metal. Cool-color metals are light, reflective colors, like white. The study went on to say that re-sealing and insulating air ducts in the attic will save even more money. Metal roofing is also lightweight, creates little stress on the load bearing roof support structures and can be installed on top of an existing roof. A lightweight roof is very useful for large and or old structures, as it helps to maintain the overall structural integrity of the building. Despite its light weight, metal roofing provides increased wind resistance when compared to other roofing materials. This is because metal roofing systems use interlocking panels.  Disadvantages  The disadvantages of metal roofs include the noise created from rain hitting the roof, large hail may leave dents, and, in snowy areas, the tendency of snow to easily fall off the roof and onto pedestrians or property. The Importance of Snow Retention Layout, http://www.constructionmagnet.com/metal-roofing-magazine/the-importance-of- snow-retention-layout  Material types  Metal roofs are sometimes made of corrugated galvanized steel: a wrought iron‚Äìsteel sheet was coated with zinc and then roll-formed into corrugated sheets. Another approach is to blend zinc, aluminum, and silicon-coated steel. These products are sold under various trade names like \\"Zincalume\\" or \\"Galvalume\\". The surface may display the raw zinc finish, or it may be used as a base metal under factory-coated colors. Another metal roofing product comes in a rolled form of various widths of so-called standing seam metal. The material is \\"seamed\\" together using a special roof seaming machine that is run vertically up the panel to seal the joints and prevent water intrusion. Metal tile sheets can also be employed. These are usually painted or stone-coated steel. Stone coated steel roofing panels are made from zinc/aluminium-coated steel with an acrylic gel coating. The stones are usually a natural product with a colored ceramic coating. Stainless steel is another option. It is usually roll-formed into standing seam profiles for roofing; however, individual shingles are also available. Other metals used for roofing are lead, tin and aluminium and copper. Copper is used for roofing because it offers corrosion resistance, durability, long life, low maintenance, radio frequency shielding, lightning protection, and sustainability benefits. Copper roofs are often one of the most architecturally distinguishable features of prominent buildings, including churches, government buildings, and universities.Austin, Jim (2006). Copper: The peacock of metals, Metal Roofing, April‚ÄìMay 2006; www.metalroofingmag.com Today, copper is used in not only in roofing systems, but also for flashings and copings, rain gutters and downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and various other architectural design elements. At the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies in Pomona, California, copper was chosen for the roofing on regenerative principles: if the building were to be dismantled the copper could be reused because of its high value in recycling and its variety of potential uses. A vented copper roof assembly at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (U.S.) substantially reduced heat gain compared with stone-coated steel shingle (SR246E90) or asphalt shingle (SR093E89), resulting in lower energy costs.Copper roofs are cool, Architecture: Working with Copper, Copper Development Association, 2009; http://www.copper.org/publications/pub_list/pdf/a4094.pdf = Coating = Coating copper roof Several different types of coatings are used on metal panels to prevent rust, provide waterproofing, or reflect heat. They are made of various materials such as epoxy and ceramic. Ceramic coatings can be applied on metal roof materials to add heat-reflective properties. Most ceramic coatings are made from regular paint with ceramic beads mixed in as an additive. Coatings are sometimes applied to copper.Clear coatings on copper alloys ‚Äì Technical Report; Copper Application Data, A4027; Copper Development AssociationClear organic finishes for copper and copper alloys; Application Data Sheet 161/0; Copper Development Association Inc. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth, and metallic tone of copper alloys. Oils exclude moisture from copper roofs and flashings and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster and depth of color. The most popular oils are lemon oil, U.S.P., lemongrass oil, Native E.I., paraffin oils, linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended up to five years. Opaque paint coatings are primarily applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required.Finishes ‚Äì Coatings, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/finishes/finishes.html#ctngs Lead-coated copper coatings are used when the appearance of exposed lead is desired or where water runoff from uncoated copper alloys would ordinarily stain lighter-colored building materials, such as marble, limestone, stucco, mortar, or concrete.Sternthal, Daniel (2000).

He is one of only two actors to have worked with all six Stooges (Shemp Howard, Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Joe Besser, Joe DeRita) on film in the various incarnations of the group (Harold Brauer, a recurring villain who appeared in three 1940s shorts, was the other). Sitka served the role of a literal \\"stooge,\\" or straight man, to the Three Stooges throughout nearly 40 of their short films, most of which were filmed during Shemp's run as the third stooge. In addition to one single appearance during Curly's run with the trio, and a limited number of appearances during Besser's, Sitka returned as a near- regular character when the trio returned to film and television with DeRita. His frequent appearances with the trio, and his role as stooge to the stooges, have earned him the informal title of being the \\"fourth stooge\\". Early life Sitka was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania in 1914. He was the oldest of five children, born of Slovak immigrant parents. His father, Emil Sitka, a coal miner, died of black lung disease when Sitka was 12 years old, and his mother, Helena Matula Sitka, was hospitalized, unable to take care of the children. His siblings were placed in foster homes, but Sitka went to live in a church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a Catholic priest for the next few years. At this time, he became an altar boy and made plans to enter the priesthood, and had his first acting opportunity in the church's annual Passion Play. At the age of 16, he and one of his brothers traveled across the United States looking for work. After a year, they returned to Pittsburgh, where Sitka found a job working in a factory. He stayed there until the great St. Patrick's Day Pittsburgh Flood of 1936, after which he departed to pursue his dream of acting in Hollywood, California. Acting career =Early acting experience= Sitka found inexpensive lodging in a small acting theater, doing handiwork to pay his rent, and gradually acting in small parts in the theater. With time and experience, the parts became larger, and eventually Sitka was directing plays as well. Since the theater did not pay, Emil always kept a job as a civil engineer to pay the bills as well as his acting career at night. By 1946, he had played dozens, if not hundreds of roles; this breadth of experience would help him in his later film career, playing everything from butler to lawyer to businessman to construction worker. =In films= In 1946, Sitka was leading his own acting troupe when he was spotted by a talent scout for Columbia Pictures. He was told to contact Jules White, head of Columbia Pictures' short film department, and was cast in a short film that White was directing ‚Äì Hiss and Yell. starring Barbara Jo Allen as her character \\"Vera Vague.\\" Hiss and Yell was nominated for an Academy Award. Several months later, he was cast in his first Three Stooges film ‚Äì Half-Wits Holiday, where he played the role as Sappington, the first footman. At the time, this episode was also the final starring role of Curly Howard, who suffered a stroke off screen and it marked the end of his career, thus making it one of only two shorts where Emil and Curly appeared together. The other short was Hold that Lion. Nevertheless, Sitka went on to appear in dozens of Three Stooges short films, as well as most of their feature films and the live action segments for The New Three Stooges 1965 cartoon series. He worked in both short films and feature films with others as well, including Lucille Ball, Milton Berle, Red Skelton, Tony Curtis, Alan Hale, Walter Brennan, Dan Blocker, Joey Bishop, Bob Denver, and many others. However, Sitka is best remembered for his association with the Three Stooges, and with one line in particular which he repeated several times: \\"Hold hands, you lovebirds!\\" from Brideless Groom (one of the four Three Stooges shorts that lapsed into the public domain and thus was distributed freely and widely). In January 1970, Larry Fine suffered a stroke during the filming of Kook's Tour. Plans were in the works for Sitka to replace him as the Middle Stooge in late 1970 and again in 1975, but nothing other than a few promotional pictures were ever made. Sitka was to play Larry's brother, Harry. He later described him as being \\"conscientious to the point of ridiculousness.\\" Two feature film offers for the Stooges had been considered, but this proposed version of the group would never transpire, due to Moe falling ill and dying shortly after its conception. One of the film offers was Blazing Stewardesses, which would go on to feature the surviving members of the Ritz Brothers. \\"Hold hands, you lovebirds\\" In the Three Stooges short Brideless Groom (1947), Shemp Howard must be married before 6:00 p.m. in order to inherit $500,000. After striking out, Shemp finally finds a girl willing to marry him, and they rush off to a justice of the peace (Sitka). As he starts the ceremony, initially telling the couple to \\"hold hands, you lovebirds\\", the other girls that turned down Shemp's proposal burst in, having heard of the inheritance. A free-for-all then ensues, with poor Sitka being struck again and again, attempting to start the ceremony, each time more disheveled and his \\"hold hands, you lovebirds\\" rather weaker. Because of the widespread distribution of this short (it is one of four Three Stooges shorts that slipped into public domain and was broadcast countless times on local television stations as a result ‚Äì one station in Richmond, Virginia ran it almost every Sunday afternoon for years in the 1980s), this scene is the one that Sitka has become best known for. Notably, a clip of this short is featured in Pulp Fiction (1994), for which Sitka's name even appears in the credits as \\"Hold Hands You Lovebirds.\\" Emil also utters the phrase in the horror film \\"Intruder.\\" Later years Sitka continued with the acting career, more out of love for acting than the need for money (including a cameo as a supermarket customer in the horror film Intruder (1989), in which he said his signature line), appearing in films as late as 1992. He was in demand at various Three Stooges conventions, and had numerous requests from Three Stooges fans to appear at their wedding to say \\"Hold hands, you lovebirds!\\" Additionally, Sitka appeared as a contestant on Let's Make a Deal in 1985, bringing along a drawing of silent film star Ben Turpin, which host Monty Hall remarked on when choosing him. After being given $500 by Hall and offered the chance to trade it for an unknown item, Sitka opted to keep the money and avoided a \\"zonk\\" prize of his-and-hers garbage cans. Personal life Sitka and first wife Donna Driscoll married in the 1940s and divorced in the 1960s. He married longtime girlfriend Edith Weber in the 1970s; they were married until her death in 1981. Sitka had seven children: daughters Elonka and Little-Star; and sons Rudigor, Storm, Tao, Darrow, and Saxon. All children are from the first marriage. Saxon carries on his father's legacy by appearing at Stooge conventions as often as possible. Death While hosting several Stooge fans in his home in June 1997, Sitka suffered a massive stroke and never regained consciousness (one fan was a certified EMT and was able to keep Sitka alive until paramedics arrived). He died on January 16, 1998 in Camarillo, California, less than a month after his 83rd birthday. He is interred next to his wife Edith at Conejo Mountain Memorial Park in Camarillo. As a tribute to his tenure with the Stooges, Sitka's gravestone reads \\"Hold hands, you lovebirds!\\", as well as \\"He danced all the way.\\"Resting Places Selected filmography * One Exciting Week (1946) as Councilman (uncredited) * Half-Wits Holiday (1947, Short) as Sappington (uncredited) * Hold That Lion!

He built the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the world from 1849 to 1851. He conducted the first ever Federal survey of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers as part of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. He published multiple books and essays on wide ranging topics including macroeconomic theory, suspension bridge construction, railroad construction, river flood control and steam powered battery rams. During the American Civil War, he received a commission as colonel and created and commanded the United States Ram Fleet, a Union Army unit of ram ships converted from commercial steamers. His ram ships played a critical role in the Union naval victory at the First Battle of Memphis. He was wounded during the battle (the only casualty on the Union side) and died soon after. Early life and education Daguerreotype of Charles Ellet, Jr. Ellet was born at Penn's Manor in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He was the sixth child of fourteen born to Charles Ellet Sr. and Mary Israel. He studied at the Bristol school and worked as a rodman, measuring for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and making drawings. Benjamin Wright promoted him to Assistant Engineer of the Fifth Residency, but in 1830, he resigned to continue his studies in Paris. He studied civil engineering at √âcole nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es in Paris. Family Both his maternal and paternal grandfathers served in the American Revolutionary War. His father was a Quaker and a descendant of Samuel Carpenter who served as Deputy Governor of colonial Pennsylvania. His maternal grandfather, Israel Israel, descended from a family of Jewish diamond cutters from Holland and was a member of Pennsylvania's Committee of Safety and a recognized active patriot. His maternal grandmother, Hannah Erwin, was from a Quaker family. Ellet married Elvira Augusta Stuart Daniel on November 7, 1837 in Lynchburg, Virginia. Her father was Virginia justice William Daniel and her mother was Margaret Baldwin. Her family was one of the First Families of Virginia and owned enslaved persons, although Ellet would not. Judge Daniel's father had served as an ensign during the Revolutionary war under Captain Arda Allen, and his wife's maternal grandfather Dr. Cornelius Baldwin had served as a surgeon for the patriot cause throughout the conflict. The Ellets' Virginia- born daughter, Mary V. Ellet Cabell, helped found the Daughters of the American Revolution and became its member n. 6. His brother Alfred W. Ellet served as a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War. Their son Charles Rivers Ellet also served as a colonel in the Union Army and commander of the United States Ram Fleet. Engineering career Wheeling Suspension Bridge circa 1850 After returning from Europe, he worked on the Utica and Schenectady Railroad and was appointed to conduct a survey of the Western New York section of the New York and Erie Railroad. In 1832 he submitted a proposal to Congress for a suspension bridge across the Potomac River but it was rejected. In 1842, he designed and built the first major wire-cable suspension bridge in the United States, spanning 358 feet over the Schuylkill River at Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Steinman, D. B. & S. R. Watson. 1957. Bridges and their builders. New York, Dover Publications. p.210 In 1848, he built the record-breaking Wheeling suspension bridge over the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia with a span over 1,000 feet. In the same year, he erected the first ever suspension bridge over the Niagara Gorge with a 770-foot span.Steinman & Watson, p. 211 His supervised construction of the James River and Kanawha Canal in Virginia. From 1846 to 1847, he worked as president of the Schuylkill Navigation Company in Pennsylvania and led improvements to the canal used for transporting anthracite coal. He also constructed railroads in those states. Ellet developed theories for improving flood control and navigation of mid-western rivers. In 1849 he had advocated the use of reservoirs, built in the upper reaches of drainage basins, to retain water from the wet season that could be released during periods of low water to improve navigation;Timeline: Development of US Inland Waterways System from Coosa-Alabama River Improvement Association, Inc. to some degree this also would tend to lessen the level of flooding during high flow. In 1850, the Secretary of War, conforming to an Act of Congress, directed Ellet to make surveys and reports on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with a view to the preparation of adequate plans for flood prevention and navigation improvement. His detailed report had considerable influence on later engineering thought and navigation improvements. His Report of the Overflows of the Delta of the Mississippi River helped to reshape New Orlean's waterfront. George Perkins Marsh published Man and Nature fourteen years later, but it was Ellet who first noted in writing that the artificial embankments created an overflowing delta. However, only decades later would his assertions be taken seriously and used in flood control decisions. United States Ram Fleet An engraving from Harper's Weekly depicting the United States Ram Fleet ships USS Monarch, USS Queen of the West, USS Lioness and USS Switzerland In September 1854, while travelling overseas, Ellet learned that the 250-ton accidentally rammed and sank the 2,794-ton . This incident convinced Ellet that with the development of steam propulsion, ramming could be a very effective form of naval combat. The Crimean War was underway and Ellet offered his services to Russian government to build a fleet of ram ships to help them defeat the naval blockade in the Black Sea during the Siege of Sebastopol. He received interest from the Russian government but the plans were scrapped after the Russian Czar was assassinated. Ellet became enthusiastic about the possibility of a ram fleet and wrote to the U.S. Navy with his plan but was unable to persuade them of the benefit. He published the pamphlet Coast and Harbor Defenses, or the Substitution of Steam Battering Rams for Ships of War in late 1855, hoping to gain the interest of the public. When the Civil War broke out, Ellet renewed his advocacy especially in light of the Confederate build up of ram ships. The Confederate forces captured the USS Merrimack at the Norfolk Navy Yard and converted her to a ram ship. Despite being bulky and slow-moving, the Union forces became convinced of the possibility of ram ships when the Merrimack, renamed CSS Virginia, sank the USS Cumberland and USS Congress at Hampton Roads. The Navy still ignored him, but in March 1862, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, familiar with his work on the Wheeling Suspension Bridge among other projects appointed Ellet colonel of engineers, and authorized him to form the United States Ram Fleet on the Mississippi River. The Union Navy's Mississippi River Squadron and the Confederate River Defense Fleet were battling for control of the Mississippi and Stanton believed the Union Navy would benefit from the addition of ram ships. Ellet and the ram fleet were outside of the naval command and reported directly to Stanton. Ellet purchased the nine fastest river steamboats available on the Ohio River and converted them to rams. Ellet assigned family members as captains of the other rams, including his brother Alfred W. Ellet, his nephew John A. Ellet, and his son Charles Rivers Ellet. On May 25, Ellet and the ram fleet joined the Mississippi River Squadron, led by Charles H. Davis, on the Mississippi River north of Fort Pillow. Davis had little faith in the effectiveness of the rams but allowed the fleet to accompany his gunboats down the river to Memphis. Ellet's ram ships helped the Union achieve a decisive victory at the First Battle of Memphis On June 6, Colonel Ellet led the rams in the Battle of Memphis as captain of with his brother Alfred W. in command of the USS Monarch. The Ellets had not coordinated a plan of attack with Davis and when the flotilla approached Confederate forces, the two rams steamed ahead of Davis' gunboats. The Queen of the West rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . After the collision, the Queen of the West came under attack from the CSS Sumter and the CSS Beauregard. The attack sheared off one of the paddle wheels from the Queen of the West and forced her to ground on the riverbank. The Monarch rammed and disabled the CSS General Price and forced her to ground on the riverbank also. Ellet sent a boarding party and captured the General Price. Ellet was wounded in the knee by a Confederate sharpshooter during the battle. His wound was the only serious casualty received on the Union side during the battle. The Confederate forces suffered a severe loss at the Battle of Memphis with heavy casualties and the loss of seven of their eight ships. Death and legacy Charles Ellet, Jr. gravestone in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia Ellet refused to consider amputation for his injury. His wound became infected and he died 15 days later of a blood infection in Cairo, Illinois. His body was taken to Independence Hall in Philadelphia, he was given a state funeral and interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery. Command of the ram fleet went to his brother Alfred W. Ellet. The U.S. Navy named a destroyer to honor the Ellet family. USS Ellet (DD-398) was in service in 1939-46 during World War II. In 1994, Stanford University received a gift of Ellet's Civil War letters from Elizabeth Ellet Nitz and Frances Ellet Ward. The papers are housed in the Department of Special Collections at Stanford University Library. On November 6, 1999, the Wheeling, West Virginia chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a commemorative plaque on the western abutment of the Wheeling Suspension Bridge recognizing Ellet's accomplishments and his daughter, Mary Virginia Ellet Cabell's, role in founding the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Discussion The building envelope (or the more modern term, building enclosure) is all of the elements of the outer shell that maintain a dry, heated, or cooled indoor environment and facilitate its climate control. Building envelope design is a specialized area of architectural and engineering practice that draws from all areas of building science and indoor climate control. The many functions of the building envelope can be separated into three categories:Straube, J.F., Burnett, E.F.P. Building Science for Building Enclosures. Building Science Press, Westford, 2005. * Support (to resist and transfer structural and dynamic loads) * Control (the flow of matter and energy of all types) * Finish (to meet desired aesthetics on the inside and outside) The control function is at the core of good performance, and in practice focuses, in order of importance, on rain control, air control, heat control, and vapor control. Water and water vapor control Control of rain is most fundamental, and there are numerous strategies to this end, namely, perfect barriers, drained screens, and mass / storage systems.11. Straube, J.F. and Burnett, E.F.P., \\"Rain Control and Design Strategies\\". Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes, July 1999, pp. 41‚Äì56. One of the main purposes of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and pitched. Flat roofs actually slope up to 10¬∞ or 15¬∞ but are built to resist standing water. Pitched roofs are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, pitched roofs are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation. Walls do not get as severe water exposure as roofs but still leak water. Types of wall systems with regard to water penetration are barrier, drainage and surface-sealed walls.various authors. Guideline for condition assessment of the building envelope. Reston, Va.: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2000. 4. Print. Barrier walls are designed to allow water to be absorbed but not penetrate the wall, and include concrete and some masonry walls. Drainage walls allow water that leaks into the wall to drain out such as cavity walls. Drainage walls may also be ventilated to aid drying such as rainscreen and pressure equalization wall systems. Sealed-surface walls do not allow any water penetration at the exterior surface of the siding material. Generally most materials will not remain sealed over the long term and this system is very limited, but ordinary residential construction often treats walls as sealed-surface systems relying on the siding and an underlayment layer sometimes called housewrap. Moisture can enter basements through the walls or floor. Basement waterproofing and drainage keep the walls dry and a moisture barrier is needed under the floor. Air control Control of air flow is important to ensure indoor air quality, control energy consumption, avoid condensation (and thus help ensure durability), and to provide comfort. Control of air movement includes flow through the enclosure (the assembly of materials that perform this function is termed the air barrier system) or through components of the building envelope (interstitial) itself, as well as into and out of the interior space, (which can affect building insulation performance greatly). Hence, air control includes the control of windwashingHens, Hugo S. L. C. Performance Based Building Design 2: From Timber-framed Construction to Partition Walls. Berlin: Ernst, William & Son, 2012. 10. Print. (cold air passing through insulation) and convective loops which are air movements within a wall or ceiling that may result in 10% to 20% of the heat loss alone.Harrje, D. T, G. S. Dutt and K. J. Gadsby, \\"Convective Loop Heat Losses in Buildings\\". Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 1985. Print. The physical components of the envelope include the foundation, roof, walls, doors, windows, ceiling, and their related barriers and insulation. The dimensions, performance and compatibility of materials, fabrication process and details, connections and interactions are the main factors that determine the effectiveness and durability of the building enclosure system. Common measures of the effectiveness of a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate (comfort), indoor air quality (hygiene and public health), durability and energy efficiency. In order to achieve these objectives, all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure, a drainage plane, an air barrier, a thermal barrier, and may include a vapor barrier. Moisture control (e.g. damp proofing) is essential in all climates, but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding.Lstiburek, Joseph W., and John Carmody.

Thermal envelope The thermal envelope, or heat flow control layer, is part of a building envelope but may be in a different location such as in a ceiling. The difference can be illustrated by the fact that an insulated attic floor is the primary thermal control layer between the inside of the house and the exterior while the entire roof (from the surface of the roofing material to the interior paint finish on the ceiling) is part of the building envelope.Vliet, Willem. The Encyclopedia of Housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 1998. 139. Print. Building envelope thermography involves using an infrared camera to view temperature anomalies on the interior and exterior surfaces of the structure. Analysis of infrared images can be useful in identifying moisture issues from water intrusion, or interstitial condensation.Hunaidi, Osama. Leak Detection Methods for Plastic Water Distribution Pipes. Denver, Colo.: AWWA Research Foundation, 1999. 57. Print. Other types of anomalies that can be detected are thermal bridging, continuity of insulation and air leakage, however this requires a temperature differential between the inside and outside ambient temperatures.Faulkner, Ray.

The role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist is to see patients with comorbid medical conditions at the request of the treating medical or surgical consultant or team. Consultation- liaison psychiatry has areas of overlap with other disciplines including psychosomatic medicine, health psychology and neuropsychiatry. Scope Liaison psychiatry usually provides a service to patients in a general medical hospital, either inpatients, outpatients or attenders at the Emergency Department. Referrals are made when the treating medical team has questions about a patient's mental health, or how that patient's mental health is affecting his or her care and treatment. Typical issues include: * Patients with medical conditions that cause/exacerbate psychiatric or behavioral problems, such as delirium. * Supporting the management of patients with mental disorders who have been admitted for the treatment of medical problems. * Assisting with assessment of the capacity of a patient to consent to treatment. * Patients who may report physical symptoms as a result of a mental disorder, or patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms. * Patients who may not have a psychiatric disorder but are experiencing distress related to their medical problems. * Patients who have attempted suicide or self-harm. * Assisting with the diagnosis, treatment and functional assessment of people with dementia, including advice on discharge planning or the need for long- term care. The psychiatric team \\"liaises\\" with many other services, including the treating medical team, other mental health services, social services, and community services. There is increasing interest on extending liaison psychiatry to primary care, for the management of long-term medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus.http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Liaison-psychiatry- faculty-report.pdf Effectiveness of liaison psychiatry Consultation- liaison psychiatry helps improve patients' coping mechanisms, treatment adherence, school/work re-integration and quality of life. An evaluation of the Rapid Assessment, Interface and Discharge (RAID) model of liaison psychiatry ‚Äî employed at City Hospital, Birmingham ‚Äî estimated that the service saved between 43 and 64 beds per day through reduced lengths of stay and prevention of readmission. In 2011 the Centre for Mental Health published an economic evaluation of the service, estimating savings of around ¬£3.5 million. This was followed in 2012 by the publication of a report recommending that every NHS hospital should have a liaison psychiatry service as standard. History The history of liaison psychiatry is partly a history of psychiatry and medicine. Galen was highly influential for over 1500 years in medicine particularly advocating the use of experimentation to advance knowledge. The polymath physician Avicenna produced many insights into medicine but only became influential in Western medicine when William Harvey's elucidation of the circulatory system forced a re-evaluation of Galen's work. The French philosopher Ren√© Descartes began the dualistic debate on the division between mind and body. Johann Christian August Heinroth is credited with the origination of the term psychosomatic illness. At the beginning of the 19th century Johann Christian Reil created the term psychiatry whilst the polymath Benjamin Rush wrote Diseases of the Mind. The philosopher Spinoza's concept of conatus, Mesmer's development of hypnosis together with Charcot's refinement of this technique influenced Sigmund Freud whose development of psychoanalytic theory was to have a profound impact on the development of liaison psychiatry. Under the guidance of Alan Gregg, psychoanalysis impacted on hospital medicine through figures such as Franz Alexander, Stanley Cobb and Felix Deutsch. Edward Billings first coined the term \\"liaison psychiatry.\\" The publishing of two texts A Handbook of Elementary Psychobiology and Psychiatry, by Billings, and Psychosomatic Medicine, by Edward Weiss and O. Spurgeon English, outlined the theoretical foundations for the developing field. George L. Engel is considered to have been one of the most important figures in the development of liaison psychiatry and coined the term \\"Biopsychosocial Model\\" which overcame divisions created by Cartesian Dualism and was to have wider repercussions on psychiatric practice. United Kingdom The Faculty of Liaison Psychiatry was established within the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1997. The European Association for Consultation Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics also produced a set of guidelines for training in Liaison Psychiatry. The American Psychiatric Association formally recognized C-L psychiatry as a subspecialty in 2004, with its own sub-specialty board exam. The profession debated about the best term for this specialty, finally settling on \\"Psychosomatic Medicine\\". A survey for NHS England in 2015 found 133 out of 179 A&E; departments could not deliver the minimum core standard for 24/7 liaison psychiatry. 11 hospitals had no liaison psychiatry service, and only 35 delivered at or above the minimum standards. Collectively there was a shortage of 1,270 trained nurses and 230 trained consultants.

It is of SLR design and was first available in 1995. It is normally sold in a kit that includes a Zoom Nikkor 35‚Äì70 mm f/3.5-4.8 zoom lens, although a Zoom Nikkor 70‚Äì210 mm f/4.5-5.6 zoom lens is also available. An electronic companion model known as the FE10 was also sold at one stage. The FM10 is not manufactured by Nikon, and is not a true member of the Nikon compact F-series SLRs, as the name implies. It is manufactured by Cosina in JapanPhotography in Malaysia ‚Äì Nikon FM10 (as are both the lenses), and is derived from the Cosina CT-1 chassis. Following Nikon's decision to concentrate on digital cameras, the FM10 and the high-end F6 became the sole remaining film SLRs to carry the Nikon name. Both remain a part of Nikon's lineup . url= http://www.nikon.com.sg/en_SG/product/film-slr-cameras/film-slr-camera- fm10-w-35-70mmf3-5-4-5 The FM10 has a shutter speed range of 1 to 1/2000th second plus bulb and flash X-sync of 1/125th second. Its dimensions are 139 x 86 x 53 mm, and it weighs 420g. The camera is finished in black with champagne chrome trim. The FM10 was originally intended for sale in developing Asian markets, but is now sold in Western countries too. Features =Operation= The FM10 is a mechanically (springs, gears, levers) controlled manual focus SLR with manual exposure control. It is operable without batteries, which are only required (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) for the light metering information system. This consists of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter linked to a center-the-LED exposure control system using vertically arranged +/‚Ä¢/‚Äì light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the left side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus the actual camera settings. The focusing screen also has 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids. Overall, the FM10 has the features of a typical late 1970s SLR. =Lens compatibility= The FM10 accepts any lens with the Nikon F bayonet mount supporting the Aperture Indexing (AI) feature (introduced in 1977), and thus the majority of Nikon lenses manufactured in recent decades. The modern Nikon-made AI lenses are the AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and Nikkor AI-S types. The discontinued Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E lenses are also AI types. Many third-party Nikon-mount lenses will also mount and function correctly on the FM10. Many of the newest Nikon and third-party F-mount lenses, and some older designs, will mount on the FM10, but will not function properly. Nikon‚Äôs most recent 35 mm film/full-frame FX digital SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (introduced in 2000) lack an aperture control ring, without which there is no way to set aperture using the FM10. AF Nikkor DX type (2003) lack an aperture ring as well, and have a smaller image circles sized for the smaller sensors on Nikon's DX digital SLRs, thus projecting a black vignette circle onto the FM10 film plane. Nikon's Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization system, available on some newer lenses since 2000, does not function on the FM10. Both IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's Advanced Photo System (APS) film SLRs and very old \\"invasive\\" Nikkor 35 mm fisheye lenses must not be mounted on the FM10, as their rear elements will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage. =Flash= The Nikon SB-M dedicated flash is designed specifically for the FM10, but it will also accept any other nondedicated hot shoe mounted flash for guide number manual or flash mounted sensor automatic exposure control ‚Äì the venerable Vivitar 283 (guide number 120, ASA 100/feet; 37, DIN 21/meters) was still available new a quarter century after its introduction in 1975. The FM10 does not accept a motor drive; film is only advanced manually via a thumb lever. Design history =Chassis= The aluminum alloy chassis used in the FM10 can be traced back more than twenty- five years to the Cosina CT-1. Cosina has a long history of producing equipment to specification for other camera companies. Other famous name SLR cameras that were built around the CT-1 chassis include the Canon T60, Nikon FE10, Olympus OM2000, Ricoh KR-5 Super II and Yashica FX-3. They differ primarily in their outer cosmetic plastic body panels, lens mounts and nameplates. This chassis is also used, in heavily reworked form, as the basis for the recent Rollei 35RF, Zeiss Ikon and Cosina's own Voigtl√§nder branded Bessa R series of 35 mm film rangefinder (RF) cameras as well as the unique Epson R-D1 digital rangefinder camera in magnesium alloy. =Target markets and criticism= The Nikon FM10 fills the very bottom of the Nikon SLR line, and was introduced to meet the needs of the burgeoning South and East Asian amateur photographic markets. Until then, Nikon cameras were world-renowned for their very high quality and durability, but were also expensive. Despite the emergence of an increasingly prosperous middle-class in these countries, their income had not yet reached Western standards, so even the cheapest Nikons were generally beyond their means. The FM10's deliberately limited features and use of relatively dated technology were intended to keep production costs- and therefore price- as low as possible for these markets. However, the FM10 has been criticised by some for perceived low quality, attributed to its targeting of the brand-conscious nouveau riche in developing countries. It is claimed that the FM10 was intended for those who desired affordable ownership of a famous brand name, regardless of the actual quality of the camera itself. Nevertheless, when news of the FM10 reached Western photographers, a clamor arose and Nikon decided to offer it worldwide. While there have been mixed opinions, with some expressing reservations about its durability, it has proved popular as an entry level beginner's camera, and for photography students needing or wanting to use film and fully manual, mechanical SLR cameras. The Nikon FM10 sells steadily because of the prominent Nikon brand on its pentaprism, and for its compatibility with a wide range of new and used Nikon and third-party lenses. It is also a fairly popular backup camera among traditionalist photographers using more sophisticated Nikon bodies. In January 2006, Nikon announced that they were discontinuing the majority of their film-based camera bodies. Along with Nikon's flagship model, the F6, the FM10 is one of only two to remain in production ().

Early years  Nani Palkhivala was born in 1920 in Bombay (now Mumbai) in what was then the Bombay Presidency to blue collar, middle-class Parsi parents. His family name derives from the profession of his forefathers (a common practice among Parsis), who had been manufacturers of palanquins (\\"palkhis\\"). He was educated at Masters Tutorial High School, and later at St. Xavier's College, both in Bombay. He was a dedicated scholar and, not letting a stammer hold him back, he excelled. At college, he earned a master's degree in English language and literature and thus,overcame his speech impairment. Upon graduating, Palkhivala applied for a position as lecturer at Bombay University, but was not awarded the post. Soon found himself trying to obtain admission to institutions of higher learning to further his academic career. It being late in the term, most courses were closed, and he enrolled at Government Law College, Bombay, where he discovered that he had a gift for unraveling the intricacies of jurisprudence. He was an excellent lawyer in his time.  Entry to the bar  Nani Palkhivala was called to the bar in 1946 and served in the chambers of the legendary Sir Jamshedji Behramji Kanga in Bombay. He quickly gained a reputation as an eloquent and articulate barrister, and was often the center of attention in court, where students of law and younger members of the bar association would flock to watch him. His excellent court craft and an extraordinary ability to recall barely known facts rendered him an irresistible force. N Palkhivala initial fort√© was commercial and tax law. Together with Sir Jamshedji, he authored what was then and still is today an authoritative work: The Law and Practice of Income Tax. Palkhivala was 30 years old at the time of the first printing. Sir Jamshedji later admitted that the credit for this work belonged exclusively to Nani. Palkhivala's first participation in a case of constitutional significance occurred in 1951, where he served as junior counsel in the case Nusserwanji Balsara vs. State of Bombay [(1951) Bom 210], assisting the esteemed Sir Noshirwan Engineer in challenging several provisions of the Bombay Prohibition Act. Before the year was out, Palkhivala was arguing cases himself, but his first case of constitutional importance (a challenge of the validity of land requisition acts) was lost before the Bombay High Court. By 1954, barely 10 years after his admission to the bar, Palkhivala was arguing before the Supreme Court. It was in his first case before this court (concerning the interpretation of Article 29(2) and Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, which regulate the rights of religious minorities) that he articulated his (later) famous statements on the inviolate nature of the constitution.  To amend or not to amend  Palkhivala had a deep respect, indeed reverence, for both the Constitution of India, and for the cardinal principles he saw embedded in it: \\"The Constitution was meant to impart such a momentum to the living spirit of the rule of law that democracy and civil liberty may survive in India beyond our own times and in the days when our place will know us no more.\\" Nani saw the constitution as a legacy that had to be honoured while simultaneously being flexible. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, he said, the constitution must go \\"hand in hand with the progress of the human mind\\". He was however a firm opponent of politically motivated constitutional amendments (His favourite quotation was from Joseph Story, who said: \\"The Constitution has been reared for immortality, if the work of man may justly aspire to such a title. It may, nevertheless, perish in an hour by the folly, or corruption, or negligence of its only keepers, the people.\\"). The culmination of Palkhivala's success before the Supreme Court came in the famous Kesavananda Bharati vs. The State of Kerala case [AIR 1973 S.C. 1461, (1973) 4 SCC 225]: Parliament had added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution through the very first constitutional amendment in 1951 as a means of immunizing certain laws against judicial review. Under the provisions of Article 31, which themselves were amended several times later, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule could not be challenged in a court of law on the ground that they violated the fundamental rights of citizens. The protective umbrella covered more than 250 laws passed by state legislatures with the aim of regulating the size of land holdings and abolishing various tenancy systems. The Ninth Schedule was created with the primary objective of preventing the judiciary ‚Äì which upheld the citizens' right to property on several occasions ‚Äì from derailing the Nehru government's agenda for land reform, but it outlived its original purpose. In the now famous ruling, on 24 April 1973, a Special Bench comprising 13 Judges of the Supreme Court of India ruled by a majority of 7‚Äì6, that Article 368 of the Constitution \\"does not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.\\". In the process it overruled a decision of a Special Bench of 11 Judges, by a majority of 6‚Äì5, on 27 February 1967, that \\"Parliament has no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights\\" (I.C. Golak Nath vs. The State of Punjab, AIR 1967 S.C. 1643, (1967) 2 SCJ 486) by stating that no specific provision of the Constitution was immune to amendmnent, but no amendment could violate the basic structure or inner unity of the Constitution. The court propounded what has come to be known as \\"the basic structure\\" doctrine, which rules that any part of the Constitution may be amended by following the procedure prescribed in Article 368, but no part may be so amended as to \\"alter the basic structure\\" of the Constitution. In 1975, shortly after the imposition of the Indian Emergency, a bench of 5 judges was hastily assembled, and presided over by Chief Justice A.N. Ray to determine the degree to which amendments installed by the government of Indira Gandhi were restricted by the Basic Structure theory. On 10 and 11 November, the team of civil libertarian barristers ‚Äì led by Palkhivala ‚Äì continuously argued against the Union government's application for reconsideration of the Kesavananda decision. Some of the judges accepted his argument on the very first day, the others on the next; by the end of the second day, the Chief Justice was reduced to a minority of one. On the morning of 12 November, Chief Justice Ray tersely pronounced that the bench was dissolved, and the judges rose. In effect, the doctrine was applied to the 39th Amendment of 1975, which attempted, among other provisions, to pass legislative judgment over the 1971 election of Indira Gandhi. Seven years later, in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India, [(1980) 3 SCC 625], Palkhivala successfully moved the bench to declare that clause (4) of Article 368 of the Constitution which excludes judicial review of constitutional amendments was unconstitutional.  Defender of rights  Not only did Nani Palkhivala interpret the constitution as a message of intent but also saw it as a social mandate with a moral dimension. As he later stated in the Privy Purse case Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia vs Union of India, (1971) 1 SCC 85]: \\"The survival of our democracy and the unity and integrity of the nation depend upon the realisation that constitutional morality is no less essential than constitutional legality. Dharma (righteousness; sense of public duty or virtue) lives in the hearts of public men; when it dies there, no Constitution, no law, no amendment, can save it.\\" He was a strong proponent of the rights of freedom of expression and freedom of the press. In an attempt to stifle dissenting opinion, the central government imposed import controls on newsprint in 1972. In the case before the Supreme Court [Bennett Coleman & Co. vs Union of India, (1972) 2 SCC 788], Palkhivala argued that newsprint was more than just a general commodity: \\"Newsprint does not stand on the same footing as steel. Steel will yield products of steel. Newsprint will manifest whatever is thought of by man.\\" In the 1970s, state legislation (education is a subject covered by the Concurrent list in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution ‚Äì i.e., both central and state governments can legislate on it) was increasingly encroaching on the rights of minority educational institutions which are protected by articles in the Indian constitution. In a landmark case [Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society vs. State of Gujarat, (1974) 1 SCC 717], Palkhivala argued that the extant right of a state government to administer an academic institution did not extend to a right to maladminister. The majority of the nine-judge bench upheld his contention, significantly strengthening the rights of the minorities. Prominent Cases Major Gen Nilendra Kumar in his book Nani Palkhivala: A Role Model (published by Universal/Lexis Nexis) has listed 140 prominent cases in which Nani appeared, giving the name of parties, citation, opposite counsels, the name of the judge who delivered the verdict and brief of the law points involved. Notable cases in the list are PJ Irani, Ujjam Bai, Gujarat University, Article 143 matter on immunity of state legislatures, Keshavnanda Bharti case,Birla Cotton, Bank Nationalization,Privy Purses,Harbhajan Singh Dhillon,Bennet Coleman,St Xaviers College,Indira Nehru Gandhi,Minerva Mills, Mandal case and TN Seshan matter of Chief Election Commissioner.  The economist  Although Nani Palkhivala was one of the leading interpreters of constitutional law and a most ardent defender of the civil liberties guaranteed by the constitution, his legacy also includes the aforementioned authoritative book, The Law and Practice of Income Tax, which he co-authored with his mentor Sir Jamshedji Behramji Kanga. Although anyone who deals with the convoluted mess that is the Indian tax code will invariably regard the work as a primary reference, the tome has also secured international recognition and served as a tax law draft guide at the International Monetary Fund. The first edition was published in 1950 when Palkhivala was only 30 years old, and is still in print today (10th edition in 2014). Sir Jamshedji, who is listed first as author, gracefully acknowledged that the credit belongs to Palkhivala. Former Attorney-General Soli J. Sorabjee, Nani's friend and colleague for many years, recalls: \\"His talent in expounding the subject was matched by his genius in explaining the intricacies of the Budget to thousands of his listeners. His famous Annual Budget speeches had humble beginnings in 1958 in a small hall of an old hotel called Green Hotel in Bombay. He spoke without notes and reeled off facts and figures from memory for over an hour keeping his audience in rapt attention.\\" Describing the Annual Budget meetings, Sorabjee goes on to say: \\"The audience in these meetings was drawn from industrialists, lawyers, businessmen and the common individual. Nani's speeches were fascinating for their brevity and clarity. His Budget speeches became so popular throughout India and the audience for them grew so large that bigger halls and later the Brabourne Stadium in Bombay had to be booked to keep pace with the demand of an audience of over 20,000. It was aptly said that in those days that there were two Budget speeches, one by the Finance Minister and the other by Nani Palkhivala, and Palkhivala's speech was undoubtedly the more popular and sought after.\\"Pai, M.R.

Recognition  Nani Palkhivala (third from right, second row) with US President Jimmy Carter during his 1978 visit to India. Palkhivala received a great deal of recognition from academics, academic institutions and the government. In 1963, Palkhivala was offered a seat in the Supreme Court, but declined. In 1968, he was offered the position of Attorney-General by Govinda Menon, then the Law Minister in the Congress Government. Palkhivala recounts in his book We the Nation: \\"After a great deal of hesitation I agreed. When I was in Delhi I conveyed my acceptance to him, and he told me that the announcement would be made the next day. I was happy that the agonising hours of indecision were over. Sound sleep is one of the blessings I have always enjoyed. That night I went to bed and looked forward to my usual quota of deep slumber.

Elizabeth Arden raced under the nom de course \\"Mr. Nightingale\\" until 1943 when she adopted the name Maine Chance Farm from her health spa in Mount Vernon, Maine. During the nineteen forties and fifties, the Maine Chance Farm racing stable was a major force in American horse racing. Among the stable's many champions and stakes race winners who raced under Arden's cerise, blue and white colors were the colt Star Pilot and the filly, Beaugay, both 1945 American national champions. The Beaugay Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack is named in the filly's honor. That year, Maine Chance Farm was the top money-winning stable in the United States. In May 1946, a fire at a racetrack in Chicago destroyed twenty- two horses owned by Maine Chance Farm. The stables' two-year-old star colt Jet Pilot survived as he had been shipped to another racetrack. Two future Hall of Famers, trainer Tom Smith and jockey Eric Guerin worked for Maine Chance Farm and in 1947, Jet Pilot won the Kentucky Derby. In 1948, Ace Admiral won the prestigious Travers Stakes and in 1954 the Maine Chance filly \\"Fascinator,\\" won the Kentucky Oaks. In 1960, the farm bred future Hall of Fame colt, Gun Bow. In 1956, Ms Arden acquired the northern portion of Coldstream Stud on the death of owner E. Dale Schaffer and renamed it Maine Chance Farm. Following Elizabeth Arden's passing, the farm property became part of the College of Agriculture at the University of Kentucky. In 2005, the University of Kentucky began the Equine Initiative Project. This project was started by the UK College of Agriculture to develop their Equine Science program into a nationally outstanding program. Currently, in 2007, the Maine Chance Farm is being revamped into a Collegiate Equestrian mecha-center. It will expectantly feature a breeding program, equestrian center, and equine disease and research center.

The bricks are flat-sided Example of chevron lead bricks used to prevent shine paths A lead castle, also called a lead cave or a lead housing, is a structure composed of lead to provide shielding against gamma radiation in a variety of applications in the nuclear industry and other activities which use ionizing radiation. Applications =Shielding of radioactive materials= Castles are widely used to shield radioactive \\"sources\\" (see notes) In this use of the term, a \\"source\\" is a radioactive material created so as to provide a source of radiation for calibration, test or irradiation purposes where the intensity, energy and radiation type is known and radioactive materials, either in the laboratory or plant environment. The purpose of the castle is to shield people from gamma radiation. Lead will not efficiently attenuate neutrons. If an experiment or pilot plant is to be observed, a viewing window of lead glass may be used to give gamma shielding but allow visibility. =Shielding of radiation detectors= Plant radiation detectors that are operating in a high ambient gamma background are sometimes shielded to prevent the background swamping the detector. Such a detector may be looking for alpha and beta particles, and gamma radiation will affect this. Laboratory or health physics detectors, even if remote from nuclear operations, may require shielding if very low levels of radiation are to be detected. This is the case with, for instance, a scintillation counter measuring low levels of contamination on a swab or sample. =Construction= The castle can be made from individual bricks; usually with interlocking chevron edges to prevent \\"shine paths\\" of direct radiation through the gaps. They can also be made from lead produced in bespoke shapes by machining or casting. Such an example would be the annular ring castle commonly used for shielding scintillation counters. A typical lead brick weighs about ten kilograms. Lead castles can be made of hundreds of bricks and weigh thousands of kilograms, so the floor must be able to withstand a heavy load. It is best to set up on a floor designed to carry the weight, or in the basement of a building built on a concrete slab. If the castle is not put directly on such a floor, it will require a suitably strong structure to safely support it.

Also, the street crew extended into East Boston, Roxbury, Waltham, Newton, Watertown, parts of Revere, and all other predominantly Italian American neighborhoods in Eastern Massachusetts. Their criminal organization was dubbed \\"In-Town\\", because one had to go in to town to visit the Angiulo Brothers. As made men in the Patriarca crime family, they were placed in control of the racketeering throughout Massachusetts, until Irish Mob groups such as the Winter Hill Gang and the Charlestown Mob decided to run the rackets in their own neighborhoods. During this time Winter Hill Gang members Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi were informing on their Italian mob colleagues by allowing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to bug their headquarters during the early 1980s. The brothers were Antonio, Donato, Francesco, Gennaro, Michele, Nicolo, and James Angiulo. They were born in North End, Boston, to Italian immigrants Cesare and Giovannina (n√©e Femiani) Angiulo.

The FBI was able to successfully plant listening devices in a bar he owned on Tremont Street. He was arrested September 19, 1983, at his North End hangout, then convicted three years later on racketeering charges.

The name also applies to the upscale residential and commercial neighborhood that sits on that hill. Location Kololo is close to the centre of Kampala, bordered by Naguru to the east, Bukoto to the north, Mulago to the north-west, Makerere to the west, Nakasero to the south-west, and Kibuli to the south. Kololo is in the Kampala Central Division. The coordinates of Kololo are 0¬∞19'46.0\\"N, 32¬∞35'41.0\\"E (Latitude:0.329445; Longitude:32.594725). Kololo Hill rises to a maximum height of above sea level. Overview Kololo gets its name from the 19th century Acholi Chief Awich, from Northern Uganda. He, along with Kabalega of Bunyoro resisted British rule. Awich was arrested and brought to Kampala and incarcerated on top of Kololo Hill. He is alleged to have cried out in Luo, ‚ÄúAn atye kany kololo‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúI am here alone.‚Äù Awich was lamenting over the fact that he had been left alone in the wilderness, miles away from home. His captors and the Baganda started calling the location and the hill \\"Kololo\\", resulting in its name today. Since the 1950s, before Uganda's Independence, Kololo has been an upscale residential area because of its central location in the city and to the views from the hill. Kololo is a popular location for diplomatic missions to Uganda, housing more than a dozen embassies and ambassadors' residences. During the 2000s, hotels, banks, hospitals, and other corporate entities began to infiltrate the hill, mainly to serve those who reside there, away from the noise and traffic congestion in the central business district located on the neighboring Nakasero Hill. However, the introduction of business premises on Kololo Hill, especially restaurants and bars, has increased noise and has introduced heavy traffic that interferes with the serenity and ambiance that was there before. Several irritated residents have jointly sued seven bars, accusing them of being the source of noise pollution. As of February 2019, the case was still winding through Uganda's court system.

The force operated from 27 police stations and has an establishment of 1078 police officers, 151 special constables and 594 support staff, as of February 2008. Tayside Police was Scotland's fourth-largest police force.  History  It was formed on 16 May 1975, with the region of Tayside, as an amalgamation of the Perth and Kinross Constabulary, Angus Constabulary and City of Dundee Police. The force was operationally subdivided into three Divisions, equating to the respective council areas - Western Division serves Perth and Kinross, Eastern Division serves Angus and Central Division serves the City of Dundee. The work of the force was overseen by the Tayside Police Joint Board, whose 18 members are nominated by the respective councils (7 by Dundee, 6 by Perth & Kinross, 5 by Angus). Tayside Police were the first in Scotland and the UK to pilot new social media software, MyPolice, launched on 17 January 2011.

The Free Church of Antioch received several lines of this succession through its founder, the late Archbishop Warren Prall Watters (1890-1992). The Free Church of Antioch was established on October 4, 1992, in Santa Barbara, California, and was incorporated in that state through The Center For Esoteric Studies, of which Archbishop Watters was the Founder and Director. The church's most important Line of Succession is derived from the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht in the Netherlands. This is important for Independent Catholics, as many hundreds of \\"wandering bishops\\" or Episcopi vagantes, derive their succession from this church. Some Roman Catholic scholars hold that the Orders of the Old Catholics are valid but illicit. Archbishop Herman Adrian Spruit, founder of the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch, consecrated Warren P. Watters to the Episcopate on April 28, 1973, at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Santa Barbara, California. Assisting Archbishop Spruit as co-consecrators were The Most Reverend Stephan A. Hoeller of the Ecclesia Gnostica, and The Most Reverend Jay D. Kirby. In 1986 Warren Watters was elevated to Archbishop and become Director of Esoteric Studies for the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch. He edited and compiled three magazines which culminated in The Esoteric Review. He founded The Center for Esoteric Studies, Inc., a California religious non-profit corporation. Watters, along with Bishops Robert Branch and Torkom Saraydarian, eventually separated from Herman Spruit, believing that they needed a freer confederation to operate their own ministries. These separations came as a result of certain actions resulting from the reorganization of the mother church, the Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch. Shortly before his death at the age of 102, Watters founded the Free Church of Antioch. One of his great concerns and motivations in founding the Free Church of Antioch was to re-establish what he believed was a needed balance of female and male in spiritual service. This concern was reflected in his ordination of many women as priests, and in the consecration of many women as bishops. Upon his death in 1992, Watters was succeeded by his wife, Archbishop Ellen Watters. Upon her death at the age of 95 on January 12, 2002, the members of the Board of Directors of the Center For Esoteric Studies, Inc., and The Free Church of Antioch passed all legalities and responsibilities of The Center For Esoteric Studies, Inc., and The Free Church of Antioch to Bishop Michelina T. Foster, Director of the Desert Light Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bishop Michelina T. Foster was consecrated to the episcopate of the Free Church of Antioch by Archbishop Warren Prall Watters and Bishop Ellen Watters. Bibliography *Bishops At Large by Peter F.

The area policed by Fife Constabulary had a resident population of just over 350,000, almost a third of whom lived in one of the three principal towns of Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes. The force was established in 1949 following the amalgamation of the originally independent Fife County, Dunfermline City and Kirkcaldy Burgh police forces. Then the number of Police Officers totalled 345, supported by 26 civilian staff. During 1949 officers dealt with 7,492 crimes and offences. At dissolution the force had 1027 Officers, who were assisted by 119 Special Constables and approximately 538 support staff. Fife Constabulary dealt with around 65,000 crimes and offences annually. The Chief Constable was responsible for ensuring that the deployment and organisation of personnel is consistent with the demands on the Force. Operational resources were allocated according to the needs of local communities and are complemented by professional administrative and support staff.

Western Division had a population of approximately 133,000 and its Divisional HQ in Dunfermline. It contained the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan Castle, Kincardine-on-Forth. Central Division was the smallest of the three Divisions but the most densely populated with 148,000 residents, and Divisional HQ in Kirkcaldy. Eastern Division was the largest of the three but had the smallest population of some 69,000. Major concentrations of population are Cupar, home to the Divisional HQ, and St Andrews. Western and Central Divisions were headed by a Chief Superintendent and a Superintendent, and Eastern Division by a Superintendent and a Chief Inspector. Force Headquarters The majority of Fife Constabulary's departments and specialist units were based at modern, purpose- built Headquarters, situated at Detroit Road in Viewfield, Glenrothes which were opened on 25 March 1996. They replaced the previous building at Dysart which had been the HQ since 1975. The building includes modern office accommodation, training facilities, lecture theatre, library, garage & communications workshops, television studio, gymnasium, and an indoor firearms range. In 2004, a new Contact Centre was opened on the Headquarters campus, enabling the Force to bring together under one roof the call handling and despatching services which had previously been dispersed across Police stations in Fife.

The term first appeared in advertising in 1974. Although this is merely a marketing concept, it suggests that the term‚Äînot the product‚Äîwas inspired from the more elaborate and impressive ancient Greek column of the Corinthian order. While the term was first used during the marketing campaign for the 1974 Imperial LeBaron, it is usually associated with the marketing campaign beginning with the 1975 Cordoba and that campaign's celebrity spokesperson, Ricardo Montalb√°n, who described the thickly-cushioned luxury of seats \\"available even in fine (alternately, \\"soft\\" or \\"rich\\" ) Corinthian leather\\". Much of the leather used in Chrysler vehicles during the era originated from a supplier located outside Newark, New Jersey. Some sources say the term refers to the combination of leather seating surfaces and vinyl seat sides. However, most cars worldwide with \\"leather upholstery\\" have matching color vinyl seat bases and often the rear faces of the front seats, the head rests, and the door facings. The standard term in period car catalogs was \\"leather with vinyl\\", and sometimes \\"leather seat facings\\". When Montalb√°n was asked by David Letterman on Late Night with David Letterman what the term meant, the actor cheerfully admitted that the term meant nothing.

This is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.  Introduction  In December 2003, the Hong Kong Government mapped out a strategy on waste management emphasized waste reduction and recovery. Hong Kong currently recycles 48% of its municipal solid waste (MSW), but over 99% of recovered recyclable materials are exported to Mainland China for further re-processing while less than 1% are treated locally and re-manufactured into useful products. With the measures to promote waste recovery, recycling and reuse in place, a local waste management area like EcoPark is a viable option for furthering Hong Kong's recycling program. EcoPark aims to promote the local recycling industry and jump-start a circular economy to provide a sustainable solution to the city's waste problems. By encouraging and promoting the reuse, recovery and recycling of waste resources and returning them to the consumption loop, the EcoPark will help realize the full potential of the local recycling industry and alleviate the heavy reliance on the export of recyclable materials recovered from Hong Kong.  Design and construction  The EcoPark occupies 200,000 square metres of land in Tuen Mun Area 38 and will be developed in two phases. As pledged in the Policy Framework, the aim is to commission Phase I of EcoPark (80,000 square metres) towards the end of 2006 and Phase II (120,000 square metres) in 2009. Hong Kong Government funding will be used to build the basic infrastructure of EcoPark. The EcoPark will be divided into lots of different sizes. Lots in EcoPark will be tendered for specific recovered materials and processes that help achieve Hong Kong's government waste management objectives, in particular, in recycling local wastes. Admission criteria will be developed with priority given to processes involving value-added technologies, and target materials of the proposed Producer Responsibility Schemes.  Progress  All six lots in EcoPark Phase I has been allocated for recycling of waste cooking oil, waste computer equipment, waste metals, waste wood, waste plastics and waste car batteries. Some of them are already in operation, while the rest of tenants will start their operation shortly. Construction works of the EcoPark Phase II have already completed. Two lots have been allocated to non-government organisations for recycling of plastics and waste electrical appliances. The remaining lots in EcoPark Phase II will be available for tendering in late 2010.  Phase I tenants  Champway Technology Limited - Recycling of waste cooking oil into biodiesel Li Tong Group - Recycling of waste computer equipment Shiu Wing Steel Limited - Recycling of waste metals Hong Kong Hung Wai Wooden Board Company - Recycling of waste wood Hong Kong Telford Envirotech Company Limited - Recycling of waste plastics Cosmos Star Company Limited - Recycling of car batteries  Phase II lots  Tendering of Phase II lots (with a total area of 100,000 square metres) will start in late 2010. Further information on the tendering can be obtained from EcoPark management office.  Visitor Centre  The 1,000-square metre EcoPark Visitor Centre is the first education centre in Hong Kong with a main theme of solid waste management. Admission is free and docent service will be provided. Online and telephone booking can be arranged through the EcoPark Management Office.  Public consultation  Hong Kong Government has consulted the Tuen Mun District Council and members support the development of EcoPark and agree that EcoPark will help promote development of local recycling industry and create job opportunities in Tuen Mun. The Council hopes that EcoPark will become a landmark for Tuen Mun. Local trade associations and recyclers were also consulted and they support the development of EcoPark, agreeing that by providing long-term land at affordable cost, together with supporting infrastructure, EcoPark will help enhance recycling technology development and improve waste recovery rates in Hong Kong.  Environmental considerations  An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out in respect of air and water quality, waste management, land contamination, landfill gas hazard and hazard to life, in which a wide range of recycling processes for different material types were examined. The assessment recommends a list of materials and processes to be allowed and also recommends a number of mitigation measures. With these measures in place, the EIA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impacts to the surrounding areas.

The police force was formed in 1948 as an amalgamation of the police forces of Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Wigtownshire, and preceded the creation of the former Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council by 27 years. The last Chief Constable was Patrick Shearer QPM. Shearer was appointed on 24 April 2007, in succession to his predecessor David Strang who was made Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police. The Deputy Chief Constable was George Graham, who took over from Robert Ovens QPM on 1 January 2006. Dumfries and Galloway is one of the safest areas in the UK because of its high rate of crime detection and convictions. The force's headquarters were located in Dumfries. An Act of the Scottish Parliament, the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, created a single Police Service of Scotland ‚Äì known as Police Scotland ‚Äì on 1 April 2013.STV News, 30 October 2012 This merged the eight regional police forces in Scotland, together with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single service covering the whole of Scotland. Police Scotland's interim headquarters is at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan in Fife. Lockerbie bombing On 21 December 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 exploded mid-air as a result of a bomb on board, and the wreckage crashed in the town of Lockerbie, within the police area of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary. In the UK, the event is referred to as the \\"Lockerbie air disaster\\", the \\"Lockerbie bombing\\", or simply \\"Lockerbie\\". Eleven townspeople were killed in Sherwood Crescent, where the plane's wings and fuel tanks plummeted in a fiery explosion, leaving a huge crater. The 270 fatalities (259 on the plane, 11 in Lockerbie) included citizens of 21 nations. The subsequent police investigation, led by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, was the largest ever mounted in Scottish history and became a murder inquiry when evidence of a bomb was found. Two men accused of being Libyan intelligence agents were eventually charged in 1991 with planting the bomb. It took a further nine years to bring the accused to trial. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was jailed for life in January 2001 following an 84-day trial, which was held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, but under Scottish law. On 20 August 2009, al- Megrahi was freed on humanitarian grounds because of an apparent terminal prostate cancer.

The B1 headcode signifies that this train worked the Euston-Watford (and vice versa) service. A refurbished Class 501 train awaits departure time at Broad Street station, shortly before the latter's closure. The B4 headcode signifies that this train worked the Broad Street‚ÄîRichmond (and vice versa) service. The British Rail Class 501 electric multiple units were built in 1955/56 for use on the former LNWR/LMS suburban electric network of the London Midland Region. A total of 57 three-car units were built. Services The services worked by the Class 501 units consisted of a small self-contained group of lines, which were electrified at 630V DC on the 3rd and 4th rail principle, linking London Euston to Watford, Broad Street with both Richmond and Watford plus the Croxley Green branch ‚Äî which was mostly served by shuttle trains from Watford. Some of these services were partially jointly operated with London Underground's Bakerloo and District Lines. In 1970 the trains were converted to 3rd rail only operation, although the 4th rail was retained on sections of line which are shared with London Underground trains. The original electric scheme on these lines was at 630V DC, which was actually supplied at +420V in the outer electric rail and -210V in the centre one, a total potential difference of 630V. This was the same system as used at the time (and still employed today) by London Underground, and allowed Underground trains to run over the lines, from Queens Park to Watford (Bakerloo line) and Gunnersbury to Richmond (District line). In 1970 it was decided to convert to the normal arrangement of the full positive current of +630V in the outer rail, and to use the normal running rails for the return current at 0 potential. This required adaptation of the Class 501 trains to return current through the wheels instead of the centre rail. On the sections shared with the Underground trains the centre rail was retained, but was now also at zero potential and just bonded electrically to the running rails. No modifications were required on the Underground trains for this change, but electrical switching units are at the lineside where Underground trains pass from one system to the other. Description The Class 501 units were built by British Railways in its own workshops at Eastleigh on short 57 ft frames supplied by Ashford. Despite British Railways having recently built modern sliding door trains for electric suburban services in Manchester and Liverpool and on the Great Eastern Main Line (classes , and respectively), it was decided that these trains would closely resemble the EPB stock of the Southern Region, which featured individual passenger-operated doors located at each seating bay. To prevent passengers leaning out of the opening windows, they were partially blocked with three bars ‚Äî this was for passenger safety when travelling through areas with limited clearance, in particular Hampstead Tunnel. This earned them the nickname \\"jail units\\". The stock differed from that for the Southern Region in that each vehicle was long instead of , and the vehicles within the units had screw coupling with two buffers instead of the close-coupled single buffer with chain arrangement used on the Southern multiple units. Formation The trains were made up in 3-car formations as follows: Driving motor with two saloons of 3+4 bays + 9 compartment intermediate trailer + driving trailer with two saloons of 3+4 bays. Unusually for the time, the vehicles featured screw couplings both within and between the units, in contrast to the SR units which had intermediate single buffer and chain and buckeye couplings at the unit ends. Although all other areas of the London Midland region had trains with both first and second class accommodation, the inner London area had withdrawn first class from main line trains operated entirely within the London Transport boundaries as a wartime measure in 1940. It was never reinstated, so these trains were second class only. Electrical equipment The motor coaches had two powered bogies and GEC electrical equipment. They were the first to have camshaft controllers. The train ends also followed the EPB style and incorporated a two-character alphanumerical headcode. ;Motors There were four 185 hp GEC traction motors Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, winter 1962/3 edition, page 325 giving a total of 740 hp per 3-car set. Livery Initially these trains were painted in the standard mid- green livery adopted for electric multiple unit stock at nationalisation. This was replaced by a dark brunswick green livery with wide yellow bands in the early 1960s, the same livery as had been adopted for diesel multiple unit stock. In the late 1960s this was changed to rail blue, and from 1981, units sent for general overhaul received rail blue and grey livery. Modification They were never facelifted or refurbished during their career; however, during the 1970s some trains had the intermediate trailers modified from compartment layout to open saloon. This work was carried out at Croxley Green workshops and, though quite neatly done, the overhead luggage racks which had been attached to the partitions were not replaced, leaving nowhere to put things like coats and umbrellas. Withdrawal The trains, which were allocated to Croxley Green depot, were withdrawn from operation in May 1985. The trains on the east‚Äìwest orbital service, from Broad Street to Richmond, were replaced with Class 416 units from the Southern Region, from the first day of the service being diverted and extended from Broad Street around eastern London to North Woolwich station. Services between London Euston/Broad Street and Watford and on the Croxley Green branch were subsequently replaced by sliding door Class 313 units. Service reduction The services they were used on were subject to considerable contraction during their lifetime. The 57 units initially replaced the 77 LNWR \\"Oerlikon\\" 3-car sets on these lines, and the 25 additional sets built by the LMS in 1927 (giving over 100 3-car sets on these lines) were withdrawn in the early 1960s without replacement. After this numbers of the Class 501 were subject to early withdrawal in the 1960s-70s (45 of the 57 units remained in traffic by 1976), and the final stage was reached where they were replaced by a small number of class 313 sets which were spare from the 1970s GN electrification. The Richmond lines were initially covered by ex-SR sets as stated above, but ultimately all the 501s territory was covered by 313s which had become spare. Furthermore, the London Underground Bakerloo line, which initially shared the system from Queens Park to Watford, was very substantially cut back and ultimately withdrawn north of Harrow & Wealdstone. The decline in traffic on the 501s' territory is unparalleled by any other electrified service in London. The substantial peak services operated by the units from London's Broad Street terminus, to Richmond and Watford, were completely withdrawn during their lifetime. Numbering British Railways numbers were: * Motor Open Brake Second, M61133‚ÄîM61189 * Trailer Open Second, M70133‚ÄîM70189 * Driving Trailer Open Brake Second, M75133‚ÄîM75189  Further use  * Ten Class 501 DMBS carriages were converted to Class 97/7 battery locomotives. * Two carriages, DTS 75186 and TS 70170, went on to work at MOD Marchwood. * Three two-car units were converted to Class 936 sandite units, and saw use until the early 2000s. Two 3-car units (xx162 & xx165) were transferred to the SR as Departmental Test Units 051 & 052 in 1969 but did not last long. Formations: 051: M61162 - DB975027; M70162 - DB975028; M75162 - DB975029. 052: M61165 - DB975030; M70165 - DB975031; M75165 - DB975032. 052 was withdrawn by 1970 and 051 was reformed as DB975029-DB975027-DB975030, but was withdrawn in late 1970, and the vehicles scrapped, except for one remaining DTBSO M75165, which was rebuilt to EPB standards and converted for Departmental Use in 1976 as Test Coach ‚ÄúMars‚Äù ADB975032, based at Strawberry Hill, for commissioning refurbished Class 410/411/412 EMUs, but it was scrapped on site by MRJ Phillips (contractors) in August 1987.

History =Roman period= Evidence suggests that there had been a settlement in the parish during the Roman period. Crop marks visible on archaeology oblique aerial photographs taken in 1976 showed a complex series of features including rectangular and sub-rounded enclosures, linear features and pits. Evidence to back Roman occupation have been backed up with archaeological finds which have includes a bracelet, coins, a dolphin brooch and a plate brooch. =Saxons= During the 1920s and '30s archaeologist unearthed a Saxon inhumation or burial containing beads and a brooch within the parish.

For realistic footage, Frissell then took his crew to the Grand Banks and Labrador to collect exciting action sequences. The film debuted at the Nickel Theatre at St. John's on March 5, 1931, where Frissell decided that his movie needed more real scenes from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell with his crew had joined the SS Viking for its annual seal hunt. The ship got trapped in ice near the Horse Islands. On March 15, Frissell and 26 others were killed when an explosion on the Viking set off a fire and the ship sank. Some of the survivors made the over-ice trek to the Horse Islands, while some were rescued by other vessels dispatched to the area.

It resembles spermaceti but is harder, more friable, and with a higher melting point. Two scale insects produce the wax: Ceroplastes ceriferus, common in China and India, and the related Ericerus pela, found in China and Japan. These insects deposit their secretions on the branches of certain species of Ligustrum (privet) tree. The insects and their secretions are harvested and boiled with water to extract the raw wax. The insect bodies, which settle to the bottom, are used as food for swine. According to an article in a November 1932 magazine article in the journal Nature by Herbert Beardsley, \\"...the male larvae of a white insect, about the size of a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night ‚Äì for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon ‚Äì traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market.\\"Herbert Beardsley, Nature Magazine article from November issue 1932 Uses Chinese wax is used chiefly in the manufacture of polishes, sizes, and candles. Candles, temple images and other articles connected with ceremonial worship, and polish for furniture. It is also used for burnishing the back of Chinese hanging scrolls with a stone. In China the wax has been employed medicinally. Taken internally, it has been used as a remedy for hoarseness, pain, worms, nervousness, and to aid the mending of broken bones. Externally, it has been used as an ointment for treatment of wounds. Other names Other names for Chinese wax include: *Chinese tree wax *Chinese insect wax *Insect wax *White wax In Japan the tree yielding it is called ibota and the wax ibotaro. Among other uses, it is used to polish white clamshell go stones.

Some secondary authorities, such as Black's Law Dictionary, define a confession in more narrow terms, e.g. as \\"a statement admitting or acknowledging all facts necessary for conviction of a crime,\\" which would be distinct from a mere admission of certain facts that, if true, would still not, by themselves, satisfy all the elements of the offense. The equivalent in civil cases is a statement against interest. History This specific form of testimony, involving oneself, is used as a form of proof in judicial matters, since at least the Inquisition. The value of confessions, however, are discussed, and law generally request cross- checking them with objective facts and others forms of evidence (exhibits, testimonies from witnesses, etc.) in order to evaluate their truth value. Confessions were first developed in the Roman Catholic Church under the Sacrament of Penance, where the confession of a sin is considered to be enough to absolve oneself. This aspect concerning moral guilt has been carried on in various legislative codes, in which a criminal is considered worse if he does not confess to his crimes. Reliability =Conditions= In Japan, the legal requirements dictate that confession is admissible as evidence only if it contains elements only the guilty could have known. However, many miscarriage of justice cases in Japan are due to the police faking the confession of guilty secrets. =Torture= On one hand, confessions obtained under torture have often been considered to be not objective enough, since the use of such means may lead to the suspect in confessing anything. However, when the confession reveals secrets only known to the perpetrator (such as the location of the body or murder weapon), the confession is reliable. On the other hand, even without torture, various cases of averred false confessions demonstrate that, in itself, one man's confession is not a sufficient proof. False memory (including memory biases, etc.) or privileges granted under plea bargaining might lead to such false confessions. = Forced confession = A forced confession is a confession obtained from a suspect or a prisoner by means of pressure, torture (including enhanced interrogation techniques) or other forms of duress, whether physical or psychological. Depending on the level of coercion used, a forced confession is not valid in revealing the truth. The person being interrogated may agree to the story presented to him or even make up falsehoods himself in order to satisfy the interrogator and discontinue his suffering. However, despite developments in the 20th century, notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which greatly reduced the legal acceptance of forced confessions, these are still practised and accepted in some jurisdictions. The People's Republic of China has been shown to systematically employ forced televised confession, often in an extrajudicial context, against Chinese dissidents and workers of various human rights group in an attempt to discredit, smear and suppress dissident voices and activism. Scripted confessions, obtained via systematic duress and torture, are broadcast on the state television. Notable victims includes Wang Yu, a female human rights lawyer, and Swedish NGO worker Peter Dahlin, and Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish book publisher. Scientific reliability Confession evidence can be considered, arguably, the best piece of evidence of guilt in the criminal justice system. However, false confessions do occur, therefore there must be some flaws in the interrogation process. In a scientific article \\"Confession Evidence: Commonsense Myths and Misconceptions\\" by Saul M. Kassin, five myths in the confession evidence system were identified. These myths are 1) trained interviewers can detect truth and deception; 2) Miranda protects the accused from interrogation; 3) people do not confess to crimes they did not commit; 4) police, prosecutors, judges, and juries can distinguish true and false confessions; and 5) it is possible to determine whether a false confession error was harmless. In the case of trained interviewers, many interrogation teams are practiced in the \\"Reid technique\\", which identifies behavioral cues common for a guilty suspect including slouching, fidgeting, and avoiding eye contact. These cues have not been empirically validated to demonstrate deception in scientific studies. In terms of the Miranda warning, it has been found that innocent suspects are more likely to waive their rights than those who are guilty, so therefore Miranda rights in most cases do not protect accused innocents from interrogation (article 1). Through the use of minimization, when an investigator justifies the crime with possible excuses to make it easier to confess to, and the use of the false evidence ploy, mentioning evidence that proves the suspect guilty (which actually does not exist), many innocent people end up confessing to crimes they have not committed. Most people cannot recognize a false confession, because confessions are trusted and a jury or judge would see confessing to a crime in which the suspect did not commit as something against self-interest, which in most people's minds does not make sense. In terms of how harmless a false confession is, it has been shown that confessions can affect other pieces of evidence and the way they are presented, which can affect a judge or jury's perception of guilt. Through debunking these myths it can be demonstrated that confessions cannot be the be-all-end-all in a criminal investigation, and the criminal justice system should implement more tactics and procedures that prevent false confessions from occurring. Worldwide =England and Wales= In English law a confession includes:Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 82. > any statement wholly or partly adverse to the person who made it, whether > made to a person in authority or not and whether made in words or otherwise. A confession may be admitted in evidence so long as it is relevant to any matter in issue and not excluded under the court's discretion. Exclusion of prosecution evidence The court must exclude evidence: * if the \\"admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it\\",Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 78 or * if it was obtained by torture.A & Ors v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005 UKHL 71] The court may exclude evidence: * in its common law discretion if the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs the probative value, or * under section 76 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Under section 76, following a representation by the defendant or upon the court's own motion, evidence tendered by the prosecution must not be admitted if it was or may have been obtained: * by oppression of the person who made it; or * in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by the accused in consequence thereof.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 76. Whether or not evidence was obtained in such circumstances will be decided by a judge sitting without a jury in a voir dire. Oppression includes torture, inhumane and degrading treatment and the use or threat of violence. Oppression imports \\"some impropriety... actively applied in an inappropriate manner by the police\\"R v Fulling [1987] QB 426. Under the second limb, a judge is not to consider whether the confession made was truthful, but rather whether, under the circumstances, \\"whatever was said or done, was, in the circumstances existing as at the time of the confession, likely to have rendered such a confession unreliable, whether or not it may be seen subsequently - with hindsight and in the light of all the material available at trial - that it did or did not actually do so\\".Mance LJ in Proulx v Governor of HM Prison Brixon [2000 EWHC Admin 381], emphasis of Mance LJ. The question of whether some action has rendered a question unreliable centers on whether it is likely to have made an innocent person confess, or even (equivalently) to have made a guilty person confess to more than their actual crime. \\"Anything said or done\\" is not limited to the actions of the police, but does not include things said or done by the accused.Goldenberg (1988) 88 Cr App R 285; Crampton (1991) 92 Cr App R 372. However, the circumstances existing at the time do include the accused's own mental state and capacities.Proulx v Governor of HM Prison Brixon [2000 EWHC Admin 381]; Everett [1988] Crim LR 826 Evidence tendered by a co-defendant The court may exclude evidence under section 76A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Following a representation by the defendant or upon the court's own motion, evidence tendered by a co-defendant of a defendant's confession must not be admitted unless the co-defendant proves on the balance of probabilities that it was not obtained: * by oppression of the person who made it; or * in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by the accused in consequence thereof.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 76A. Statements made in the presence of the accused The common law rules on the admission of confessions are preserved,Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 118. and apply so long as the statement was made voluntarily. Under the common law, where a statement is made in the presence of the accused, by a person with whom the accused is on even terms,R v Collins and Hill [2004 EWCA Crim 83]. upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from him, the accused's acceptance of that statement,Christie [1914] AC 545 including by giving an insufficient explanation or by acquiescence. In deciding whether to put the matter to the jury, the judge should ask:R v O [2005 EWCA Crim 3082] > (1) could a jury properly directed conclude that the defendant adopted the > statement in question? If so, (2) is that matter of sufficient relevance to > justify its introduction in evidence? If so, (3) would the admission of the > evidence have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that > the judge ought not to admit it? =Canada= Canadian common law on confessions is derived directly from English decisions and legal principles. There are some differences including the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that give an accused person more rights. The crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused confessed voluntarily or the confession will be excluded from evidence by the judge. The legal term voluntary has a different meaning than the everyday meaning of voluntary. The crown will be looking to prove the absence of threats, direct or veiled, by the police. Threats will almost certainly render the confession involuntary. This can include threats to arrest or interrogate other persons close to the accused. Promises or inducements made in the form of a quid pro quo (like a confession in exchange for ignoring a more serious charge) will also often result in an inadmissible confession. Generally, police are allowed to lie by claiming to claim to have evidence, like DNA evidence that does not exist. If police lies cause the suspect to say anything that implicates themselves in the crime the confession would be admitted into evidence. See R. v. Oickle. =India= In India, forcefully obtaining confession is unconstitutional. This was reaffirmed on 5 May 2010 by the Supreme Court of India in the case \\"Smt. Selvi vs. State of Karnataka\\" in which it was held that Narcoanalysis, polygraph (also called Lie-detector) and brain mapping tests to be unconstitutional as they violate Article 20(3) of the Constitution. =Italy= Confessions have been used extensively in Italy since the creation of the pentito status. Adriano Sofri, for example, has been given a life-sentence exclusively on the words of one pentito. =United States= In the 1936 case Brown v. Mississippi, the United States Supreme Court ruled that convictions which are based solely upon confessions coerced by violence violate the Due Process Clause.

The Court held that there was no conflict between federal dangerous driving offences, which only prohibited \\"advertent\\" negligence and provincial careless driving offences, which included \\"inadvertent\\" negligence. The analysis used here is also known as the paramountcy doctrine. Background The defendant was charged under section 55(1) of Manitoba's Highway Traffic Act which prohibited driving ‚Äúon a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway‚Äù. The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ‚Äúoccupied the field‚Äù with a similar criminal provision in the Criminal Code,Criminal Code, SC 1953-54, c 51, s 221(1). which prohibited driving with \\"wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\\" The issue before the Court was whether provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences would necessarily be a criminal law and thus encroach on federal jurisdiction. Opinion of the Court The opinion of the Court was written by Judson J., with Kerwin, Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, and Ritchie concurring. Judson held that ‚Äúthe power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted‚Äù. He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a \\"general area\\" or \\"domain\\" of criminal law. Thus the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability:SCC, p. 808 On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ‚Äúthere is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant‚Äù. The provincial law extended to include ‚Äúinadvertent negligence‚Äù as well as regular negligence. It was enough that ‚Äúthe two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect‚Äù to justify both of them. Dissent Cartwright and Locke JJ., in dissent, held that there is no possibility of overlapping domains. He stated that the leading case on the matter, ‚Äò‚ÄôProvincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan‚Äô‚Äô, cannot be read so broadly as to give the provinces unlimited powers over highways. Matters in relation to those within the federal government's powers are exclusive and comprehensive and do not allow for complementary law: On the facts, he found that there was no difference between the provincial Act and the provision in the Criminal Code which occupies a domain exclusive to the federal government.

He is known as the earliest successful commercial map-publisher in the city of Baltimore. The first of his atlases was published in 1815‚Äì17, in which the maps are closely associated with the 1822 edition of Philadelphia atlas by Carey & Lea. Career history City plan of Baltimore by Fielding Lucas Jr., 1852 Lucas founded Lucas Bros. Inc. in 1804 which was located at 116, East Baltimore Street, and became the first stationer in the United States. In 1806 Lucas served as the Baltimore manager of the Philadelphia publishing firm, Conrad, Lucas, and Co., when it opened its offices there. In 1834, Lucas published the first \\"The Metropolitan Catholic Calendar and Laity's Directory\\" - an annual calendar, which was renamed to \\"Metropolitan Catholic Almanac\\" by him in 1838. In the issue of 1845 there is inserted a map of the United States, \\"prepared at much expense to exhibit at a glance the extent and relative situation of the different dioceses\\", with a table of comparative statistics from 1835 to 1845. A list of the clergy in England and Ireland was added in the volume for 1850. Because of Lucas and a younger contemporary, Ireland-born John Murphy, Baltimore was the major center of Catholic publishing until it shifted to New York City at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1866, his son, William F. Lucas, acquired the Lucas Bros. printing and stationery business. =Books and atlases= Below are some of the books published by Lucas: * A New and Elegant General Atlas: Containing Maps of Each of the United States (1814) * A General Atlas Containing Distinct Maps of All the Known Countries in the World (1823) * Lucas' Progressive Drawing Book (3 parts) (1827) **Part I: The Principles of drawing in Pencil **Part II: Colouring and Shading in India Ink **Part III: A Treatise on Perspective * Picture of Baltimore: containing a description of all objects of interest in the city; and embellished with views of the principal public buildings (1832) Commemorations General Atlas of the world by Fielding Lucas Jr., 1823 As an artist, Lucas helped publish one of the first color plate books titled \\"Flora's Dictionary\\", for which an 1837 review reads thus: \\"One of the most popular genres of color plate books in the antebellum period were those devoted to the sentiments associated with flowers. Colored illustrations of flowers were accompanied by a text which guided the reader through the hidden meanings of different blooms, with quotations and poetry appropriate to each. This is a pioneering example of this type, issued by the publishers of many early books with color, Fielding Lucas of Baltimore. Similar works were issued at every level of quality and size, from pocket-sized volumes with crude plates to highly finished folios.\\" David Rumsey states that, \\"While the same base maps were used ... the maps in [this] Lucas Atlas are far superior in quality ‚Äì Welch re-engraved many of the maps for Lucas that Young & Delker has engraved for Carey & Lea.\\" Rumsey further notes that the \\"Lucas General Atlas\\" of 1823 was the \\"finest general atlas produced in the U.S. at the time\\", setting aside the Tanner and Finley atlases as specialized publications.

Synopsis Allison Gross, a hideous witch, tries to bribe the narrator to be her \\"leman\\". She combed his hair, first. When a scarlet mantle, a silk shirt with pearls, and a golden cup all fail, she blows on a horn three times, making an oath to make him regret it; she then strikes him with a silver wand, turning him into a wyrm (dragon) bound to a tree. His sister Maisry comes to him to comb his hair. One day the Seelie Court comes by, and a queen strokes him three times, turning him back into his proper form. Motifs The horn motif is not clear. In \\"The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea\\", the witch uses it after the transformation to summon her victim, but nothing appears to stem from it here.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 314, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The thwarted supernatural lover ‚Äì nereid, fairy, elf, or troll ‚Äì taking this form of revenge is a common motif; the tales are generally a variant on Beauty and the Beast, where the victim must live in that form until finding another love, as beautiful as the thwarted lover.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 313‚Äì14, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The transformation back being performed by the Queen of the Fairies, however, is a unique motif. This ballad was one of 25 traditional works included in Ballads Weird and Wonderful (1912) and illustrated by the sculptor Vernon Hill.  Written sources and recordings  William Tytler The ballad was provided by Mrs. Brown (n√©e Anne or Anna Gordon), recorded by her nephew, Robert Eden Scott, in 1783 (or \\"shortly before\\"), and in the same year it was sent by her father, prof. Thomas Gordon, to William Tytler with other 14 recorded songs (so-called Tytler-Brown MS). For \\"Allison Gross\\", no other source has been found. The ballad was first published by Robert Jamieson in his Popular Ballads in 1806. The first sung folk revival recording of Alison Gross was by Dave and Toni Arthur on their 1970 album Hearken to the Witches Rune (Trailer LEA 2017), three years before Steeleye Span recorded their British folk rock version on their Parcel of Rogues album. The music Steeleye composed for it was substantially more rock-influenced than most of their more folk music-influenced recordings, and they included a chorus that was not in Child's collection. The Steeleye Span version concludes with its narrator, having rebuffed the advances of Allison Gross numerous times, transformed into \\"an ugly worm\\". However, other recordings include the several additional verses chronicle his life after this, including his transformation to his proper form by the queen on Halloween. Also known as \\"Alison Cross\\", it was recorded by Lizzie Higgins, Elspeth Cowie, and Malinky. The Norwegian folk- rock band Folque produced the song in Norwegian in 1974 on their self-titled album. The Czech folk band Asonance recorded this song in Czech in the year 2000. A spoken word version of the ballad was recorded by John Laurie in 1962 on the Folkways album The Jupiter Book of Ballads (Folkways Records FL9890).

Located at 45th Street and Fourth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, it is served by the R train at all times. The N train also stops here during late nights, and some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction. The 45th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 45th Street started on March 15, 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on September 22, 1915, after the opening of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 59th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926-1927, and again during a renovation in 1968‚Äì1970.  History  =Construction and opening= The 45th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907. As part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. The proposal was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Construction on Route 11B1, the section of the extension between 43rd Street and 61st Street, which includes the 45th Street station, began on March 15, 1913. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915. The section of the line running through the 45th Street station opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island, which included the Fourth Avenue Line north of 59th Street as well as the entire Sea Beach Line. The line's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. However, the 45th and 53rd Street stations remained closed, despite being technically complete, since the stations were being used by a contractor to haul dirt out. The stations opened on September 22, 1915. = Station renovations =  1920s  On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, 45th Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.  1960s  In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 45th Street, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between this station and Bay Ridge‚Äî95th Street on May 3, 1968. As part of the renovation project, the station's platforms were extended . The northbound was extended to the north, and the southbound platform was extended to the south. In addition, the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were covered over with white cinderblock tiles. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition and that the change was made to improve the appearance of stations and provide uniformity. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \\"any great artistic merit\\". Station layout This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The R stops here at all times; some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction; and the N stops here during late nights, but uses the center express tracks to bypass the station during daytime hours. The platforms are offset as the northbound platform extends further north than the southbound one. Columns run along the entire length of both platforms and are painted dark blue. Every other column has a \\"45 Street\\" sign on it in black with white text. All are round except for the ones near the staircases to the station's main entrance, which was where the platforms were extended in 1970. These columns are I-beams. Prior to the station's 1970 renovation, it was finished all in white and marble tile, and it had its own color scheme to allow regular passengers to identify the station based only on the color of the marble trimmings. Since the renovation, the station walls have consisted of white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain gray-painted cinderblock tiles. The gray cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. Eastern street stair =Exits= The station's main entrance is a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks at the north end. It has two staircases to the Manhattan- bound platform and one to the Bay Ridge-bound one at the extreme south end, a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to the northern corners of 45th Street and 4th Avenue. The mezzanine contains some of the original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the staircases to the southbound platform says \\"Down Town trains\\" while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform staircases says \\"Up Town Trains.\\" The southbound platform formerly had an exit-only at the center that led to 46th Street. Evidence of this includes a gated door on the platform wall and adjacent \\"EXIT\\" signs. The northwest corner exit was closed after it was accidentally destroyed by nearby construction workers. On May 16, 1979, Community Board 7 held a meeting to determine whether residents wanted the entrance closed. The board's chairman cited crime as a reason to close the entrance. The New York City Transit Authority promised to comply with the wish of the board, and the entrance was closed.

AN/AWG-9 The AWG-9 was the result of a series of United States Navy programs to build what was known as a \\"fleet- defense fighter\\": an aircraft armed with extremely long-range radars and missiles that would be able to engage formations of enemy aircraft well-away from aircraft carriers. Their first attempt was the F6D Missileer, which combined Westinghouse's AN/APQ-81 pulse doppler radar with the Bendix AAM-N-10 Eagle missile. The Missileer was a relatively simple aircraft, and when planners expressed doubts about its ability to survive after firing its missiles, the Missileer was canceled and the Navy started looking for higher- performance alternatives. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force had been working on a similar long-range interceptor project of their own, the XF-108 Rapier. The Rapier had much better performance than the Missileer, although its AIM-47 Falcon and AN/ASG-18 radar, both from Hughes, were somewhat less advanced than their Navy counterparts. The entire system was also very expensive, and the Rapier was canceled, replaced by the hopefully less- expensive Lockheed YF-12 adapted from the Lockheed A-12 spy plane. This project was also canceled as the strategic threat moved from bombers to ICBMs. The same was not true for the Navy, where the threat remained manned aircraft and early anti-ship missiles. Hughes suggested that the AN/ASG-18 and AIM-47 could be adapted for the Navy in slightly modified form, adding additional tracking capability while reducing the size of the radar antenna to a size more suitable for carrier aircraft. The result was the AN/AWG-9 radar and Phoenix missile. All that was needed was a suitable airframe, which led to the Navy's involvement in the F-111B program. Although the radar and missile systems started to mature (after the better part of a decade at this point) the F-111B proved to be considerably overweight and had marginal performance, especially in engine-out situations. At the same time, real-world combat over Vietnam was proving that the idea of the all-missile fighter was simply not viable, and any fighter design would have to be able to dogfight with guns, which the F-111 was simply not suited to. This should not be surprising given the F-111's genesis as a tactical bomber and interdictor. After many years in development and arguing with Congress, the Navy finally started development of a new aircraft specifically tailored to their needs. The new aircraft emerged as the F-14, armed with the same AWG-9/AIM-54 outfit originally intended for the F-111B. On the F-14, the AWG-9 is capable, and its doppler system allows it to have look-down, shoot-down capabilities.Modern Marvels: F-14 History Channel DVD Hughes delivered enough AWG-9 systems and spares to equip approximately 600 F-14A/B aircraft for the Navy, and an additional 80 aircraft for the Iranian Air Force. All of the Navy systems have been retired; some of Iranian systems are still in service. AN/APG-71 The APG-71 was a 1980s upgrade of the AWG-9 for use on the F-14D. It incorporates technology and common modules developed for the APG-70 radar used in the F-15E Strike Eagle, providing significant improvements in (digital) processing speed, mode flexibility, clutter rejection, and detection range. The system features a low-sidelobe antenna, a sidelobe-blanking guard channel, and monopulse angle tracking; all of which are intended to make the radar less vulnerable to jamming. The system itself is capable of a range, but the antenna design limits this to only . Use of datalinked data allows two or more F-14Ds to operate the system at its maximum range. Hughes delivered enough APG-71 radars and spares to equip 55 F-14Ds before the program was scaled back as a cost- cutting measure and eventually canceled. The F-14 was officially retired from United States Navy service on September 22, 2006, with the last flight occurring October 4, 2006.

It is operated by Northern Trains. Cheadle Hulme's first railway station opened in 1842, when the Manchester and Birmingham Railway to Crewe was completed. With the extension of the line to Macclesfield, and later Stoke-on-Trent, a new station opened in 1845 which has served the area since. The railway transformed it from a collection of small hamlets into a suburb of over 29,000 people. History =Background= The station front c. 1900 In 1833 Parliament approved the Grand Junction Railway, a railway line to connect Manchester and Birmingham.Crouzet, p.284 It opened in 1837, after proposals had been made for more direct routes in 1830 and 1835. The earlier schemes attracted little interest, but two proposals were put forward in late 1835. The two companies, based in Manchester and Birmingham, had to negotiate with each other to develop the proposals, and they were altered somewhat over the next two years. In 1837 Parliament approved the final plans for lines to Crewe and Stoke. The companies merged to become the Manchester and Birmingham Railway company, and the first part of the line opened in June 1840. It originally ran from a temporary station at Travis Street in Manchester, to a station in Heaton Norris just north of Stockport. A large viaduct was built over the River Mersey, and opened to trains on 10 May 1842. It allowed services to be extended to Sandbach; in the following August they reached Crewe. Also at this time, a new station opened to serve as the line's northern terminus; it later became Manchester Piccadilly. Edgeley railway station opened in February 1843 in response to complaints that the Heaton Norris station was \\"too inconvenient\\", and it soon became Stockport's busiest station. Three years later in 1846 the Manchester and Birmingham Railway company merged with two other companies to become the London and North Western Railway. =Cheadle station= A train passing through Cheadle Hulme towards Handforth. The white building in the background is the original station house. The original Cheadle Hulme railway station on the Crewe line, about south-west of the current structure, was known simply as \\"Cheadle\\". It was in use from May 1842, following the opening of the viaduct. The station building, opposite the Hesketh Tavern public house, is now a private residence. It included a structure from which tickets were sold, and in the window of which a candle was lit to act as a signal during the hours of darkness. This structure, however, no longer exists. When plans were made for a line to Stoke-on-Trent, it was originally intended for a branch to be built from Stockport to Macclesfield. Instead, the junction was built south at Cheadle Hulme. The line was constructed over four years: it opened for goods traffic as far as Poynton in June 1845, and on 24 November it reached Macclesfield and was opened to the public.Knight, p.677 In June 1846 Parliament authorised the completion of the line to Stoke-on-Trent.Slaughter, p.25 By June 1849 the section between Congleton and Macclesfield was completed and the line was finished.Ingham, p.364 =New station= An aerial view of the station, dating from 1927 After the Stoke line opened, the station was rebuilt north-east at the junction so it could serve both lines. The new station opened on 9 June 1845; at first, southbound services ran to Crewe and Poynton. By November the line had been extended to Macclesfield, and by 1849, when the original station closed, it had reached Stoke-on-Trent. The new station had four platforms, and was served by trains running between Manchester and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent. It was renamed Cheadle Hulme in 1866, to avoid confusion with Cheadle LNW railway station which opened the same year. Before the arrival of the railway, Cheadle Hulme was a rural and agricultural cluster of hamlets. The railway brought a huge influx of people to the area, and provided opportunities for residents to work in places such as Manchester. Cheadle Hulme gradually grew to become a large suburb of over 29,000 people thanks to the railway. =Derailments= Platforms 3 and 4 on the line to Stoke, facing south. The sharp curve which caused the 1964 derailment is clearly visible. A special train - known as the \\"Lollipop Express\\" - carrying 234 school children from Gnosall, Stafford to York for a day trip derailed at the station on 28 May 1964. Three people, including two children, were killed and 27 were injured. The bridge, which carried the line between Macclesfield and Stoke, was in the process of being reconstructed. Passing trains were restricted to a temporary speed limit of . A hearing determined that the train's excessive speed had caused the derailment because the train driver was not aware of the speed restriction. In July 1969, there was another derailment near Cheadle Hulme involving a freight diesel locomotive. It injured no one but blocked services to Crewe and Stoke- on-Trent for several hours. =Alterations= Platform 3 facing towards Stockport. The waiting shelters were originally built to replace buildings which included a ticket office and waiting room. The station front in 2009 The original station was sited above road level (as it is today). Passengers accessed the other two platforms by a footbridge, which was removed after the lines were electrified. Cheadle Hulme was also used as a goods depot until 31 October 1964, when goods trains were withdrawn. The goods yard is now a car park. The lines to Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent were electrified in 1960 and 1967 respectively. In 1963, due to the growing amount of traffic travelling down Station Road, it was decided that the parts of the road that pass under the bridges should be widened, as they were becoming a bottleneck. The bridge carrying the line to Stoke was upgraded first. The road under it was more than doubled in width, and the bridge height was increased by allowing double- decker buses to pass underneath. Work on the second bridge commenced on 8 June 1965, increasing the height and width in accordance with Ministry of Transport requirements. Around this time, the station itself was upgraded: the platforms were demolished and replaced, and new waiting shelters were erected. A new booking office, facing Station Road and approached by a flight of stairs, was built alongside a new booking lobby, toilets and staff accommodation. New entrances to the platforms were built, and the entire station was installed with electric lighting. Station Road was significantly widened and rerouted slightly in 1967 in a further attempt to accommodate increasing traffic. Following the privatisation of British Rail, the station operation was taken over by Railtrack, and later First North Western until 2004 when it was taken over by Northern Rail, the station was taken over by Northern in 2016 and Northern Trains in 2020. In 1996 Railtrack launched a ¬£1 billion programme to restore and renovate every station it operated. Cheadle Hulme had ¬£1.2 million spent on repairs to its platforms, buildings and waiting shelters, and new lighting installed throughout the station. Stephen Day, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cheadle Hulme, opened the updated station in March 1998. The junction itself was revamped in 2000 and the signal box was removed, having been superseded by a central signalling point at Stockport station. In 2011, major work was carried out after years of campaigns, with the construction of pedestrian bridges connecting all four platforms, and lifts enabling disabled access to the platforms.  Modern-day station layout  The station is situated immediately south of a V-shaped junction station on the West Coast Main Line, where the lines to Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent split. It is situated above street level. There are four platforms: * Platforms 1, accessed from a long flight of stairs from Station Road, serves trains towards Manchester from the direction of Alderley Edge and Crewe. * Platform 2, accessed through the ticket office, serves trains towards Alderley Edge and Crewe. * Platform 3, also accessed through the ticket office, serves trains towards Manchester from Stoke-on-Trent * Platform 4, accessed either from the car-park to the east of the station, or via another long flight of stairs, serves trains towards Stoke-on-Trent. Each platform is provided with waiting shelters, passenger information screens, and lifts and stairs to footbridges enabling access between platforms, which were constructed in 2011. There is also a lift to the car park, enabling disabled access to the station. Services Northern Trains provides passenger services. Three trains per hour run northeastwards to , one of which extends north of to via . In the other direction, trains run hourly on the line (serving all stations to , then ). On the line, one train per hour runs to serving all stations, and one train per hour serves the same stations and continues to Crewe. Sundays sees an hourly to service each way and six trains to and from .

Previously, he served as Al Jazeera's chief strategic advisor for the Americas, 2010‚Äì2011, based in Washington DC. He also served as managing director of the Al Jazeera English network, based in Doha, Qatar, from 2008 to 2010. Prior to this, from 2002 to 2007, he was the editor in chief of CBC News. In October 2007, Burman received the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television's Gordon Sinclair Award for lifetime achievement in broadcast journalism. In October 2009, Arabian Business magazine named him the second most influential non-Arab in the Arab world. Then, in November 2009, the Canadian Expat Association also announced that he had been voted the third most influential Canadian living abroad, behind Michael J. Fox and Wayne Gretzky. Career Tony Burman has worked as a journalist in print, radio, television, and online. Although he is now chief strategic advisor for Al Jazeera English, his career started in the 1960s. For most of this time (35 years), he was at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He is also active in supporting public broadcasting and investigative journalism. =Pre-CBC= Print As a student in the 1960s, Burman edited two school newspapers, one of which was the Loyola News (of what is now Concordia University). In that role, most notably, he was called upon by the Canadian University Press to investigate the circumstances surrounding the resignations of the editors of the University of Windsor's student paper, the Lance, who had reprinted a controversial essay comparing the status of students at California State University and the status of African Americans in society. His commission concluded the university administration had interfered with the independence of the newspaper and forced the editors out: \\"the concept of freedom of the press at Windsor is very much in doubt.\\" His arguments in the official report, filed at the CUP office in Ottawa, later became encapsulated as the exemplar case in defending the underground journalism movement; the Canadian counterpart to a larger debate regarding the treatment of a now-classic civil rights essay, The Student as Nigger, as well as other related forms of \\"challenging\\" social commentary. Burman's first professional role was as an Education Reporter at his father's newspaper, the Montreal Star, in the late 1960s. He then spent several years as a freelancer, including a stint in South America, where he found his first big story: Vilcabamba, often called the valley of longevity and reputed to be one of the sources for modern fountain of youth mythologies. From 1982 to 1984, Burman contributed a dozen essays on international relations to The Globe and Mail. =CBC= Radio Burman joined the CBC in 1972. He worked for CBC Radio in Montreal as a contributing producer to As It Happens and, later, as executive producer of Cross Country Checkup. Television After working in Montreal as a current affairs story editor with the nightly news program City At Six he moved to Toronto, where he ultimately landed as senior writer on The National under the guidance of Lloyd Robertson (1975‚Äì76), Peter Kent (1976‚Äì78), and Knowlton Nash (1978‚Äì88). From 1980 to 1982, Burman was executive producer of The National and created the redesign of the newscast when it moved in 1982 to its new prime-time slot at 10 p.m. After this, he spent three years based in London (1982‚Äì85) for CBC Television news. In London, he and correspondent Brian Stewart were the first North American journalists on the ground to cover the 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia, where they found Birhan Woldu (the \\"face of famine\\" that inspired both Live Aid and Live 8). Burman produced many documentaries during his five-year tenure as senior producer with The Journal (1985‚Äì90). These included, among others: *Nelson Mandela: A Profile, the first television biography of Nelson and Winnie Mandela (Gemini Award nom. 1986); *Air India Crash, a film about the bombing of Flight 182 (Canadian Association of Journalists award for Best Documentary 1987); *Spanish Civil War: The Last Great Cause, a look back at the Spanish Civil War on its 50th anniversary (Gemini Award 1988); *Human Tragedy in the Sudan, about the odyssey of children who marched half way across Sudan to seek refuge in Ethiopia to escape slavery and starvation or death in the civil war raging in their homeland (Michener Award citation of merit 1989); *Sudan: Children of Darkness, an inside look at the kidnapping of children as part of the second Sudanese civil war (Gemini Award 1990; Prix UNDA (Unda Dove), Festival de T√©l√©vision de Monte-Carlo 1991). In 1989, The Journal also won TV Guide's Most Popular Program Award. From 1990 to 1993, Burman was chief news editor of CBC Television. In 1993, he returned to The National as executive producer, creating the current hour-long format and successfully addressing management concerns regarding the show's flagging ratings and declining quality (via e.g., Gemini Award nom. 1995, 1996, 1997). He also led several successful co-productions with other media organizations, including The New York Times and Frontline. Management Before returning to produce The National in 1993, Burman spent a year as managing director of CBC's all-news network, CBC Newsworld. Since his return to management in 1998, Burman served as head of CBC Newsworld until his retirement in 2007. Burman had also been in charge of all journalistic programming since February 2000. On June 19, 2007, he announced his retirement from the CBC after a 35-year career, effective July 13. =Al Jazeera= Burman's appointment as managing director of Al Jazeera English was announced on 14 May 2008. In this role for two years, he has returned to North America and presently serves as chief strategic advisor for the Americas. This new position is intended to \\"accelerate expansion in the North American market,\\" following the successful launch of AJE in Canada. =Service= Burman has served on the boards of several charitable organizations. He also travels widely in support of public broadcasting, speaking at universities and conferences around the world (e.g., at Concordia University, Osgoode Hall Law School, UBC Journalism School, J√∂nk√∂ping University, Sweden). In November 2009, he delivered the annual Clissold Lecture at the University of Western Ontario. In 2010, he delivered the Minifie Lecture at the University of Regina and the keynote address at Media Democracy Day 2010. In 2011, he was the \\"headline\\" speaker at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, journalism ethics conference. =2012 Statements On Canada-Israel Relations= In an article published by the Toronto Star on September 7, 2012, Burman stated that the recent decision by the government of Stephen Harper to sever diplomatic relations with Iran was evidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is Canada's \\"new foreign minister. His day job may be prime minister of Israel, but Canada‚Äôs abrupt actions against Iran seem to confirm that the Harper government‚Äôs outsourcing of Canada‚Äôs Middle East policy to Jerusalem is now complete.\\" He further stated that \\"There is little else to conclude from Canada‚Äôs unwise decision to move unilaterally on Iran at this moment\\" Burman wrote that the Canadian government has adopted a \\"passionate pro-Israeli stance\\" and \\"has gained the reputation throughout the Middle East of being a passionate warrior on behalf of Israel‚Äôs foreign ministry.\\" Burman cited \\"references in the Israeli media about Canada‚Äôs unwavering support of the Israeli government\\" to support his claim. He concluded the article by stating that \\"reflecting on its recent actions, we may have to wait until our government checks with its new foreign minister in Jerusalem before we get some answers.\\" =Recent scholarship= Burman, T.

Thoughts on journalism *Credibility: \\"Every news organization has only its credibility and reputation to rely on\\". *Public Broadcasting: \\"It's sad there is no tradition of public service broadcasting in the U.S., a country of 300 million people, beyond PBS. It's a problem for us all.... If there is a resurgence in public service broadcasting, hopefully it will be universal\\". *Supporting Democracy: \\"We believe that informed citizenship benefits from the expression of the fullest range of responsible opinion on important issues, rather than artificially limiting the spectrum of debate to favour one particular perspective -- however apparently right and justified it may be. At the end of the day, we trust our [audiences] to draw their own conclusions\\". *New Trends: \\"In the days ahead... the challenge for established newspapers, broadcast networks and websites is to come up with ways of harnessing the power and wisdom of the audience in a way that adheres to professional ethics and accepted journalistic policy. In other words, a genuine partnership -- and one that is more methodical than simply tossing people small cameras or microphones and then wishing for the best\\". *New Trends: \\"More than ever, audiences are determining how the media will evolve. They want news, information and much of their media on their terms on a variety of platforms -- whether TV, radio, newspapers, laptops, personal organizers, cellphones or iPods. And they want a genuine two-way relationship with their content-providers that is more than simply sitting back and absorbing.... They want to respond, engage and create -- to be contributors, not merely consumers\\". *Credibility: \\"Credibility cannot be achieved overnight. But public broadcasters must conduct journalism in an open and accountable way.... If you find that the news is only gossip and irrelevant to public interest, avoid going into it\\". *Supporting Democracy: \\"There is no more important contribution that we can make to society than strong, spirited investigative journalism\\". *In a Crisis: \\"the role of the media... is to try to separate fact from fiction, to help our audiences understand what is happening and why ‚Äî and to respond to the unfolding drama, as best we can under the circumstances, in a way that makes sense of it all.... To connect the dots, knowing full well that horrific events are rarely random\\". *New Trends: \\"We're heading into a world where we're all going to become content providers, not TV stations, not newspapers, not radio stations.... Our reporters will no longer be radio reporters or TV reporters ‚Äî that particular T-shirt will be put aside and there will be far more contributions to the web, far more mixing and movement among the various networks and platforms\\" *New Trends: \\"I have always felt that an openness to change and renewal is at the core of the best journalism\\". *International News: \\"I have a feeling that, as we look ahead five to 10 years from now, that we‚Äôll look back at 2008 as being very much a turning point for American democracy. So, it‚Äôs important that not only Americans understand what is going on, but also those of us outside of America.\\" *Public Broadcasting: \\"there‚Äôs more to journalism than simply the commercial aspect of it.... I have incredible distrust and a skepticism about the commercial influences on journalism and on news organizations.\\" *International News: \\"...people care about what‚Äôs in front of them, what‚Äôs on their street and in their community, but that should not be at the expense of understanding the world. I think the financial meltdown was a reminder that what globalization means is a lot of the decisions that affect your life are made far from your community.... You have to see the wider world and what kind of impact it‚Äôs having on your lives. The only way you can do that is through the media, because the media provides a window on that world. And if those windows are shut by organizations that up till now provided international coverage, then people who are interested in the world have few places to go\\". *International News: \\"People need accurate information to make sensible choices about their lives, about the direction of their countries. An informed citizenry produces enlightened policies that benefit people generally. And the reverse is true‚Äîwhen you have inaccurate information or you have sensationalism or distortion, that plays with people‚Äôs minds and leads to bad decisions.... I think that organizations like Al Jazeera, ...that are committed to accurate and full information, ultimately help society.\\" *Supporting Democracy: \\"In the U.S., the broadcast media in particular does a poor job of making crucial issues clear and relevant for Americans to understand. And I think that‚Äôs a real threat to a functioning democracy\\". *New Trends: \\"We have always needed to rely on people in our audiences and in the public to be our eye witnesses. The challenge in our use of social media is to determine how to organize it and marshal it in ways that enrich our content and better serve our audiences. And we can do that by creating ways to double- check and verify the accuracy of this information. We can‚Äôt just put things on the air, on the Web or in print\\". *New Trends: \\"There is so much potential here in North America, compared to the developing world, because computers, smartphones and the Internet are everywhere. It's a way to enrich our coverage and capture a younger audience. But in the developing world, social media are being used far more to help people learn about their societies and figure out how to make them better. We should learn from that\\".

The business was absorbed into Boots Opticians in 2009 and stores have gradually been rebranded under the Boots Opticians name, completed in 2015.  History  On 21 April 1750, Peter Dollond opened a small optical business in Vine Street, near Hatton Garden in London. He was joined by his father, John Dollond, in 1752. The Dollonds became notable for the quality of their optical products. In 1761 John Dollond, now a partner in the business, was appointed optician to King George III and the Duke of York and Albany. In 1781, Peter Dollond made bifocal spectacles. At The Great Exhibition 1851 in London, the Dollonds were awarded a medal for the excellence of their optical instruments. In 1889, James Aitchison established his first business in Fleet Street. In 1927 Dollond & Co merged with Aitchison & Co, to form Dollond & Aitchison (abbreviated D&A;). In 1969, the company moved to its Aston, Birmingham. During the 1960s, Dollond & Aitchison was a subsidiary of the former British television company Television Wales and West. From 1970 until 1982, D&A; were successful in a series of acquisitions in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. In 1994, however, management buy-outs of the UK, Spanish and Italian companies took place. In the 1990s, D&A; launched a number of services for customers such as, in 1996, the introduction of computer analysis for eyesight. The company ran a series of adverts in the 1990s featuring screen actor Burt ReynoldsBurt Reynolds Ad for Dollond and Aitchison to promote the service. Voiced by Actor Tony Clarkin. They launched their website in 1997 and in 1998 began a \\"contact lenses by post\\" scheme. The Italian frame manufacturer De Rigo purchased D&A; in 1999 for around 50 million pounds.Frame specialist De Rigo buys Dollond and Aitchison, Optician, Volume 216, Number 5681, December 11, 1998, page 5. In 2001, D&A; sold its manufacturing arm to BBGR. In the same year, restructuring of the company took place, consisting of the three wholly owned subsidiaries and holding company. The company employs more than 2,500 staff, including more than 400 opticians. At the time of the Boots merger it had approximately 380 branches in the UK, consisting of around 240 group-owned sites and 140 franchises. On 29 January 2009, it was announced that Boots Opticians were to merge with D&A;, forming a chain of 690 stores and 5,000 staff after Boots purchased a controlling share in D&A.; The company had denied several months previously that it was in financial trouble. Market share Dollond & Aitchison was one of the four major UK opticians that between them control 70% of the British market for glasses and contact lenses.

It is protected as a Grade I listed building. History Another view of the entrance The two-storey manor house was built for Sir Henry Fermor in the 1520s. It was visited many times by Henry VIII with Anne Boleyn and Catherine of Aragon, including using it as a base for visiting the nearby Walsingham shrine. After the Fermors the house passed to the Calthorpes who had married into the Fermor family. Later it was owned by the L'Estranges c1720 and then the Astleys. During these years, the house barely changed. However, in the 18th century it fell into decline. By the 19th century it was largely derelict, and was visited by lovers of romantic ruins. It was restored in the 1920s and 1930s. The house was owned for many years by Sir John Guinness, a former diplomat who also helped found the National Heritage Memorial Fund. He sold it after the death of his wife in 2014 for ¬£2.75m to the artist and entrepreneur Roy Griffiths who is now also trying to sell the property. Brickwork East Barsham is noteworthy for its ornate Tudor brickwork, and its cluster of 10 chimneys.

He was both able to conciliate Makololo and Lozi and repel two attacks brought against him by Mzilikazi, king of the Ndebele. He died on July 7, 1851, shortly after meeting at Linyati, his capital, the missionary explorer David Livingstone, with whom he developed a warm friendship.  Personality  Distinguished as both a warrior and a statesman, Sebetwane was able to consolidate his military gains by his generous and just treatment of the conquered peoples. Even those who had been conquered by him and eventually fled his kingdom maintained that he was an extremely warm leader: Sebetwane \\"loved people very much even if they were his victims.\\"Moanaphuti Segolodi, \\"Ditso Tsa Batawana,\\" 1940. https://www.academia.edu/12170767/Ditso_Tsa_Batawana_by_Moanaphuti_Segolodi_1940  Family  Sebetwane had a wife named Setlutlu.

It was the most expensive work on the line and at 2 miles, 346 yards (3,535 m), the second longest tunnel on the Midland system. By means of a connection on to the old LNWR line from Buxton at Hazel Grove that was opened in 1986, it is now part of the Hope Valley Line into the present-day Stockport railway station. There is also a short (174 yard) Disley Tunnel nearby on the Buxton Line. Sketch map of Midland Railway lines into Manchester showing the Disley Tunnel The \\"new line\\" The Midland Railway found that with the boom in railway traffic during the last decade of the 19th century the pressure on railway routes was intense with the volume of passenger and goods traffic increasing. This problem was present in all parts of the UK - though the Midlands, especially the Main Line to Manchester and Liverpool, was particularly crowded. The London and North Western Railway and the Great Northern Railway owned the Main Line to Manchester, which meant that the Midland's trains had the lowest priority. The Midland joined with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway company to form the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee with the intention of building a \\"new line\\" that would bypass the main line, and give priority to their own trains, thus speeding up the service. Various routes were tried, including the \\"Manchester South District Railway Company\\" from Heaton Mersey to Chorlton- cum-Hardy. However, congestion continued. New Mills and Heaton Mersey Railway To relieve the congestion through Stockport Tiviot Dale a new line, to be called the \\"New Mills and Heaton Mersey Railway\\", was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1898. The plan was to create a railway line that would take four tracks, and most bridges and cuttings were constructed with this width in mind. Location Despite being named after Disley, the tunnel runs under High Lane and Disley. The New Mills and Heaton Mersey Railway line goes underground where the Middlewood Way (the old Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway), crosses the line, about 1/4 mile north of the A6 in High Lane. The tunnel passes under a housing estate, the Macclesfield Canal, Disley golf course and finally the Peak Forest Canal, just before emerging at Disley, meeting the Hope Valley line. Construction A tunnel ventilation shaft near Disley Golf Course in 2012 The construction method used was to drive the tunnel bore from both ends, while also sinking 11 shafts from the top of the hill along the path of the railway. Work began in 1900, and the miners worked both directions from each shaft, which allowed 24 simultaneous working faces. Ten of the shafts were later used for ventilation, and are still in use - they are visible as large blue brick towers following the line of the tunnel. The Midland Railway purchased the land above the tunnel in order to sink the shafts - boundary markers made of old rails, with the initials \\"M.R.\\", remain along the line of the tunnel. A surface standard gauge contractors line was set up, using steam locomotives and a \\"steam navvy\\", following the subterranean path of the tunnel. The navvies The construction of the tunnel brought a small army of navvies into the area. They were housed in temporary villages at New Mills and Wybersley, and in specially-built houses near the Rising Sun pub in Hazel Grove, which still exist, and are known as the \\"Navvy Mansions\\". A church made of tin was erected at Wybersley, where the Midland Railway had a local administration office. Three hundred of the navvies' children attended the local schools. Operation The first section of the line opened in 1901 from Heaton Mersey to Cheadle Heath where a large station was built to serve Stockport. The second section from Cheadle Heath to New Mills South Junction opened to passenger traffic on 1 July 1902. A local passenger station at Hazel Grove (South) was constructed, but this closed in 1917 as the main purpose of the line was express trains. The line was fast, with trains reaching 100 mph along the track. In 1959 a train recorder timed a Britannia Class locomotive, the Iron Duke (No 70014), doing 89 mph between Cheadle Heath and Didsbury. In 1973, a freight train was derailed inside the tunnel due to a broken rail. Recovery of the wagons took about a week.

The play is based on the historical meeting of Gabriele d'Annunzio and Lempicka, who was hoping to be commissioned by d'Annunzio to paint his portrait. He had invited her to his villa at Gardone Riviera, on the southwest shore of Lake Garda, a villa now known as Il Vittoriale degli Italiani. Style The play draws the audience into a labyrinthine story which reflects complicity in civic responsibility. Lempicka declines to use her voice, despite the power given it through her cultural preeminence. She sells her art to the highest bidder without comment. In Tamara, the barrier between spectator and actor has been dissolved; the spaces intermingle, and spectators become actors on many stages. Tamara is postmodern theatre performed in a large house with ten actors performing simultaneous scenes in several different rooms; at other times there is simultaneous action in eleven rooms. The spectator can accompany the character of their choice and experience the story they choose, knowing that with the simultaneous performances they cannot experience the whole play. Thus the members of the audience make a series of choices, and depending upon these choices, each spectator creates and develops an individual viewing of it.D. M.

Just as in the case of a regular buffer, it is a storage medium that enables compensation for a difference in time of occurrence of events. More specifically, an optical buffer serves to store data that was transmitted optically (i.e., in the form of light), without converting it to the electrical domain. Optical networks Today, computer networks consist of optical fiber links, interconnected by electrical nodes. The data transport in the backbone is done in the form of light, typically from LED or laser. DWDM technologies enable bitrates well beyond 1 Tbit/s. However, at the nodes, this light has to be converted to the electronic domain, in order to switch all data to their separate destinations. Due to rapidly increasing channel capacities, the switching capacity is becoming the bottleneck of the system. Currently, research activities focus on optical switching technologies, that involve fewer or no conversions from the optical to the electronic domain. An important problem however, is the buffering. Contention resolution Whenever two or more data packets arrive at a network node at the same time and contend for the same output, external blocking occurs. All packets but one are perceived as superfluous, and have to be dealt with. Next to the obvious choice of dropping all excess packets, academic literature typically presents three solutions: buffering, deflection routing or wavelength conversion. Optical buffering uses fiber delay lines (FDLs) to delay the light, and is regarded as the most effective, but comes with the additional cost of the FDLs. Implementation of optical buffers As light cannot be frozen, an optical buffer is made of optical fibers, and is generally much larger than a RAM chip of comparable capacity. A single fiber can serve as a buffer. However, a set of more than one is usually used. A possibility, for example, is to choose a certain length D for the smallest fiber, and then let the second, third... have lengths 2 cdot D, 3 cdot D,ldots . Another typical example is to use a single loop, in which the data circulates a variable number of times. Research Currently, research on optical buffers is performed in two separate fields. One is to investigate on the technological implementation of this buffer, and try to reduce the size by using slow-light devices. The other is to better overall performance, by using stochastics. (Further detail on the latter approach can be found e.g. on the author's homepage.)

Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (, THL D√ºjom Jikdrel Y√©sh√© Dorj√©) (10 June 1904‚Äì17 January 1987)His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, was the second Dudjom Rinpoche. He was recognized as a direct rebirth of Dudjom Lingpa (1835‚Äì1904) and was also later appointed the first supreme head of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism by the fourteenth Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration. Biography =Introduction= Dudjom Rinpoche was born in southern Tibet in a region called Pemak√∂ (now M√™dog County), which is known in Tibetan as a beyul () or \\"hidden land\\". The second Dudjom Rinpoche was known as Jigdral Yeshe Dorje; Jigdral () \\"fearless\\" was the name given to him by Khakyab Dorje, the fifteenth Karmapa. He was named J√±ƒÅna as a child, a Sanskrit term of which \\"Yeshe\\" () is the usual Tibetan translation. His father was Kathok Tulku Norbu Tenzing, who was a famous tulku in the Pema K√∂ region who had been trained in the Katok Monastery. His mother was Namgyal Drolma, descended from Ratna Lingpa. Dudjom Rinpoche was also a descendant of Nyatri Zangpo and Powo Kanam Depa, king of Powo. Followers believe that it was written in tantras and old prophesies that during the eon of the Buddha Pranidhanaraja, Dudjom Rinpoche was the yogin Nuden Dorje Chang, who vowed to appear as the thousandth and last Buddha of this Light eon as Sugata Mopa (Od) Thaye. According to the biography of Dudjom Rinpoche on the web site of Wogmin Thubten Shedrup Ling, a Drikung Kagy√º monastery, in his previous lives amongst many notable historic figures he was ≈öƒÅriputra, one of the foremost disciples of Gautama Buddha in India; Saraha, the first and greatest of the eighty-four mahƒÅsiddhas of India; and Humkara, who was also a mahƒÅsiddha.Drikung Kagyu Buddhist Monastery, Wogmin Thupten Shedrup Ling The Nyingmapa incorporates many diverse lineages and practices, often varying from one geographical locale to another‚Äîthough they all trace their lineage sources to Padmasambhava‚Äîand as a result, they had not historically appointed a head of their lineage. The new position of lineage head of the Nyingmapa was requested by the Central Tibetan Administration for representational purposes in that body, and the Nyingma leaders asked Dudjom Rinpoche to fulfill that role on behalf of the Nyingma school. Dudjom Rinpoche was known for preserving many of the historic terma teachings and practice lineages that were at risk of being destroyed. He is described by followers as having been an exceptional scholar in various fields, including s≈´tra, tantra, prose literature, poetry, and history. He wrote a history of the teachings of the Nyingma lineages, encompassing twenty-five volumes, with the intent of creating an authoritative account,Dudjom Rinpoche's Collected Works as well as other teachings, poetry, and terma teachings. He presented a new framing of the philosophical schools used within Buddhist debates. He also helped transfer many texts out of Tibet, preserving them from destruction after the invasion of Tibet and the Cultural Revolution. He organized the building of monasteries, and teaching and retreat centers, in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and other countries. The system of teachings of the Nyingmapa is categorized as Dzogchen, or \\"Great Perfection\\". The fourteenth Dalai Lama, like some of the previous Dalai Lamas, is also a holder of Dzogchen teachings; both of the Dalai Lama's teachers in the Dzogchen tradition‚ÄîDilgo Khyentse and Trulshik Rinpoche‚Äîwere disciples of the second Dudjom Rinpoche. In 1988, a year after his death, Dudjom Rinpoche's physical body was moved from France and placed in a st≈´pa in one of his main monasteries near Boudhanath, Nepal. Pilgrims may view his body through a glass window in the st≈´pa. In a letter, Dudjom Rinpoche appointed the Dzogchen master Chatral Sangye Dorje (1913‚Äì2015) as his Vajra Regent. =Dudjom Rinpoche's family= Dudjom Rinpoche was a householder, a yogi, a writer, and a master and guru with a family, married twice. His first wife was Sangyum Kusho Tseten Yudron; their eldest daughter, Dechen Yudron, is now in Lhasa, taking care of Dudjom Rinpoche's seat, Lama Ling, in Kongpo. Their eldest son, Thinley Norbu, was himself considered a great master and esteemed Nyingma scholar like his father. Their second son, Dola Tulku Jigmed Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche of the mainly Sakya lineage, was the father of Dudjom Yangsi Rinpoche. Their daughter Pema Yudron lives near Dola Rinpoche in Qinghai. Their third son, Pende Norbu, who is living in Nepal and his wife Sangyum Kusho Pasang Wangmo. She is daughter to T.N Sherpa. He was a student to Dudjom Rinpoche and together they build the monastery in Kalimpong called the Zang Dho Phri. Pende Norbu Rinpoche has a daughter khandro Sonam chuyki is a clairvoyant and 3 sons Tuklu Jigmy, Tulku Gyume and Tuklu Pema. they live in Kathmandu. The fourth son, Dorje Palzang, went to school in Beijing in the late 1950s, but was killed during the Cultural Revolution. Another daughter, Dekyong Yeshe Wangmo, was recognized as an incarnate ·∏çƒÅkinƒ´ and was believed to be an emanation of Yeshe Tsogyal, but died when she was a young woman. It was said that since birth she had no shadow, which meant she had fully attained the rainbow body () while in the flesh, and that she displayed many miraculous signs and all who saw her felt great devotion.http://www.saraswatibhawan.org/SaraswatiBhawanNewsletterWinter2005x.pdf Dudjom Rinpoche wrote the now famous \\"Aspiration Prayer to Journey to the Realm of the Copper Colored Mountain\\" after her death;Aspiration Prayer to Journey to the Realm of the Copper Colored Mountain it is said the inspiration for this prayer was her parting gift for sentient beings. Dudjom Rinpoche's second wife is Sangyum Kusho Rikzin Wangmo, and they had three children, including one son and two daughters. Their elder daughter is Chimey Wangmo, and their younger is Tsering Penzom. Their son, Dungsay Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche (gdung sras gzhan phan zla ba nor bu, b. 1950), is spreading his father's teachings in both Europe and the United States. Dudjom Rinpoche's two grandsons via his son Thinley Norbu are also renowned lamas. His wife, Jamyang Ch√∂d√∂n, comes from an impressive blood lineage of K√ºnkhen Pema Karpo from the Drukpa Lineage in Bhutan. One is Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, who is the rebirth of Dzongsar Khyentse Ch√∂kyi Lodr√∂; he is a great master and has a huge following, and oversees many monasteries and educational and retreat centers in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and worldwide. In accordance with the wishes of his teachers, he has travelled and taught throughout the world, establishing centres in Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia. His organisation Siddhartha's Intent organises his teachings, while the Khyentse Foundation is dedicated to providing for the needs of his responsibilities. He is also (under the name Khyentse Norbu) an acclaimed film director and writer. The other grandson is Garab Dorje Rinpoche, who is a yogi practitioner and has a growing following in Bhutan and East Asia. Apart from his root gurus‚ÄîDudjom Rinpoche and Thinley Norbu‚Äîhe studied under many renowned and accomplished masters, and pursued higher studies at Penor Rinpoche's Institute and at the Mindrolling Monastery in India. He is responsible for the welfare of several hundred monks at Rangjung W√∂sel Ch√∂ling, nuns at Thegchog Kunzang Ch√∂d√∂n, and an old folks' home and four retreat centers in eastern Bhutan. He has also established Buddhist study centers globally. At present, there are twenty-five Tr√∂ma Ch√∂d Groups, ranging from five hundred to over a thousand members, throughout Bhutan; there are also Tr√∂ma Ch√∂d Groups in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Singapore and Germany. Garab Dorje is one of the very important lineage holders of the Dudjom New Treasure () lineage. Dudjom Rinpoche's grandson, the fifth Kathok Situ (son of Shenphen Dawa Norbu), is based in Nepal and Bhutan. He is the \\"heart son\\" of Chatral, under whose guidance he is actively involved in Buddhism in the East. =Birth= Dudjom Rinpoche was born on July 22, 1904 according to the Western (Gregorian) calendar‚Äîthe year 2444 after Buddha's passing into parinirvana, the year 2440 after the birth of Padmasambhava, and the year 2031 counted from the inception of the Tibetan monarchy. According to the astrological sixty-year cycle it was year of the Wood Dragon, sixth month, tenth day. The month and day also correspond to the birth date of Padmasambhava. Rinpoche was born into a noble family in the south-eastern Tibetan province of Pema Ko, which is one of the beyul (\\"hidden lands\\") of Padmasambhava. He was recognized as the incarnation of Traktung Dudjom Lingpa (1835‚Äì1904), a famous tert√∂n or discoverer of concealed \\"treasures\\" (terma), particularly those related to the practice of Vajrakƒ´la (rdo rje phur pa). Dudjom Lingpa had intended to visit southern Tibet to reveal the sacred land of Pema K√∂, but as he was unable to do so, he predicted that his successor would be born there and reveal it himself. =Dharma activity= In his youth, Dudjom Rinpoche studied with some of the most outstanding masters of the time.Jnanasukha Dakini Heart Essence PDF Gallery He began his studies with Khenpo Aten in Pema K√∂, before attending some of the great monastic universities of Central Tibet, such as Mindrolling, Dorje Drak and Tarj√© Tingpoling, and of East Tibet, such as Kathok and Dzogchen. Mindrolling was the monastery to which Dudjom Rinpoche returned to perfect his understanding of the Nyingma tradition. Foremost among his many teachers were Phungong Tulku Gyurm√© Nged√∂n Wangpo, Jedrung Trinl√© Jampa Jungne, Gyurme Phendei √ñzer, and Minling Dordzin Namdrol Gyatso. Dudjom Rinpoche's main area of activity was in Central Tibet, where he maintained the Mindrolling tradition, and especially at Pema Ch√∂ling and his other seats in the Kongpo and Puwo regions of southern Tibet. He was renowned in Tibet for the depth of his realization and spiritual accomplishment, as well as for his unsurpassed scholarship. Unique in having received the transmission of all the existing teachings of the Nyingma tradition, Dudjom Rinpoche was especially renowned as a great tert√∂n, whose termas are now widely taught and practiced, and as a leading exponent of Dzogchen. Above all else he was regarded as the living embodiment and regent of Padmasambhava and his representative for this time. Known as the \\"master of masters\\", he was acknowledged by the leading Tibetan teachers of his time as possessing the greatest power and blessing in communicating the nature of mind which is necessary for enlightenment as realized in Dzogchen. It was to him that the great masters sent their students when prepared for this \\"mind-direct\\" or mind-to-mind transmission. Dudjom Rinpoche was the root teacher of many of today's most prominent masters. Amongst the most widely read of his works are The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism, Its Fundamentals and History; which he composed soon after his arrival in India as an exile and which is now available in English translation. This monumental history of the Nyingma School also presents a great deal of new material on the development of Buddhism in Tibet. At the invitation of the Dalai Lama, Dudjom Rinpoche also wrote a history of Tibet. Another major part of his work was the revision, correction, and editing of many ancient and modern texts, including the whole of the Canonical Teachings (kama) of the Nyingma School, a venture he began at the age of seventy-four. His own private library contained the largest collection of precious manuscripts and books outside Tibet. After leaving Tibet, Rinpoche settled first in Kalimpong, in India. He gave extensive teachings in Kalimpong and Darjeeling. These were very popular and he became famous throughout the Tibetan community. However, during a train ride back to Kalimpong coming from Dharamsala in the 1960s, the head lama of Kathok Monastery, Kathok √ñntrul Rinpoche, well known for the ability to do mirror divination, said that he saw a Padmasambhava statue wrapped in barbed wire. Dudjom Rinpoche was with him on-board and actually it was Rinpoche himself that asked for that divination. The train had a stopover in Siliguri. In that city, there were some people with sectarian sentiments, political motivation and completely jealous of Dudjom Rinpoche's flourishing activities. Those ones told the Indian intelligence that Rinpoche was collaborating with the Chinese Communist party and was receiving a salary from them. When the train stopped, the police put him under house arrest.[DONGYAL, Khenpo Tsewang. Light of Fearless Indestructible Wisdom - The life and Legacy of H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche. Ithaca,Snow Lion Publications, 2008.] As the news of this spread, his disciple were shocked and saddened. They'd also heard that authorities were going to transport His Holiness by train from Siliguri to Panchimari, the site of a prison for Tibetans detained for political reasons. Many students from Sikkim, Darjeeling, Bhutan, and Kalimpong planned to prevent the train from leaving by lying on the railroad tracks. But by then His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his officials, the king of Sikkim, and the king, queen, and ministers of Bhutan, and important figures from India and Nepal, as well as thousands of students, had already written letters to Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India. After a few days His Holiness was released from house arrest in Siliguri and returned to his home in Kalimpong. He played a key role in the renaissance of Tibetan culture amongst the refugee community, both through his teaching and his writing. He established a number of vital communities of practitioners in India and Nepal, such as Zangdok Palri in Kalimpong, Dudal Rapten Ling in Orissa, and the monasteries at Tsopema and Boudhanath. He actively encouraged the study of the Nyingma Tradition at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies in Sarnath, and continued to give teachings according to his own terma tradition, as well as giving many other important empowerments and transmissions, including the Nyingma Kama, the Nyingma Tantras and the Treasury of Precious Termas (Rinchen Terdzo). When Dudjom Rinpoche was eight years old, he began to study Shantideva's Bodhicharyavatara with his teacher Orgyen Chogyur Gyatso, a personal disciple of the great Patrul Rinpoche. When they had completed the first chapter, his teacher presented him with a conch shell and asked him to blow it towards each of the four directions. The sound it made to the East and to the North was quite short, in the South it was long, and in the West longer still. This was considered to be an indication of where his work in later times would be most effective. Kham, in the east of Tibet, had been the birthplace of Dudjom Lingpa, who had already been very active in that region. In the South, throughout the Himalayan regions of Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal and Ladakh, Dudjom Rinpoche had many thousands of disciples; when, on one occasion, he gave teachings in Kathmandu intended only for a few lamas, between twenty-five and thirty thousand disciples came from all over India and the Himalayas. In the final decade of his life, in spite of ill-health and advancing years, he devoted much of his time to teaching in the West, where he successfully established the Nyingma tradition in response to the growing interest amongst Westerners. He founded many major centres including Dorje Nyingpo and Orgyen Samye Ch√∂ling in France, and Yeshe Nyingpo, Urgyen Ch√∂ Dzong and others in the United States. During this period, he tirelessly gave teachings and empowerments, and under his guidance a number of Western students began to undertake long retreats. Dudjom Rinpoche also traveled in Asia, and in Hong Kong he had a large following, with a thriving center which he visited on three occasions. In the 1970s, Dudjom Rinpoche conducted a few teachings in the United States and London and then some retreats at Urgyen Samye Ch√∂ling in France. Eventually, \\"the wanderer, Dudjom\\", as he sometimes used to sign himself, settled with his family in the Dordogne area of France, and there in August 1984 he gave his last large public teaching. He died on January 17, 1987.Dudjom Rinpoche - Rigpa Wiki Dudjom lineage The Dudjom terton lineage started in 1835 with Dudjom Lingpa.Dudjom Lingpa - Rigpa WikiTerton Dudjom Lingpa - RangjungYesheWiki Dudjom LingpaJnanasukha Dakini Heart Essence PDF Gallery is considered a mind manifestation of Padmasambhava. Dudjom Lingpa was also considered a voice manifestation of Yeshe Tsogyal. Finally Dudjom Lingpa was considered the body manifestation of his own previous reincarnation, Drogben Lotsawa, who was one of the twenty-five main disciples of Padmasambhava]. Other reincarnations of Dudjom Lingpa, besides the most recent Dudjom Rinpoche, have been claimed. One story of his reincarnation describes a new birth occurring before Dudjom Lingpa died. In that story, he sent his main disciples to Pema Ko saying: \\"Go to the secret land of Pema Ko. Whoever has faith in me, go in that direction! Before you young ones arrive, I will already be there.\\"SB Lamas - Dudjom Rinpoche It took a few years for the disciples to stumble upon the exact location but the very young Dudjom Rinpoche reportedly aged about three called the surprised incognito strangers by their individual names, spoke in their Golok dialect which no one else did in that area and invited them to his surprised parents' house. It is said he could remember his previous lives clearly. Dudjom Yangsis Yangsi () or Tulku is the honorific title of a young reincarnation of a high lama. There are reportedly three known current Dudjom Yangsis. One of the three to be recognized as the incarnation of Dudjom Rinpoche was his own grandson, Sangye Pema Zhepa, born in Tibet.Dudjomba Buddhist Association He was first recognized in 1993 by Tare Khandro (Tare Lhamo). Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche confirmed the recognition,Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje - RangjungYesheWiki as did Chatral Rinpoche who was named by Dudjom Rinpoche as his successor in a letter to take over all his spiritual matters and sit in the middle of his mandala after his death. Chatral Rinpoche was the main teacher of Dudjom Rinpoche's grandson and reincarnation as he promised to the previous Dudjom Rinpoche, who wrote a long life prayer for him.

His father is Jigme Tromge Rinpoche and his mother is Rigzin Wangmo Tromge.Ati Ling Tibetan Buddhist Center Dudjom Tersar Dudjom Tersar is the collective name for the large collection of terma teachings revealed by Dudjom Lingpa and Dudjom Rinpoche. As a class of texts, Tersar (gter gsar) means \\"new or recently revealed treasure teachings\\". Dudjom Rinpoche was a major terton (Wylie: gter ston) or treasure revealer of hidden teachings. Dudjom Rinpoche is considered one of the Hundred Great Tertons in the Nyingma lineage. Most terma are small in scale; major cycles are rare. Those containing many major cycles, such as Dudjom Tersar, are even rarer historically. The Dudjom Tersar is possibly the most comprehensive suite of terma to be revealed in the twentieth century. Since terma traditionally are considered to be discovered during the time they are most needed, the most recently discovered terma may be the most pertinent to current needs. Recent terma are, then, considered to \\"still have the warm fresh breath of the dakinis\\". A set of preliminary practices known as Dudjom Tersar ng√∂ndro has to be undertaken by beginners prior to higher initiations. Dudjom Tersar contains different cycles: some are comprehensive, from beginning instruction through the highest Dzogchen teachings, and there are also smaller cycles, and individual practices, for specific purposes. There are four major cycles in the Dudjom Tersar of Dudjom Lingpa, the first three being Mind Treasures (Wylie: dgongs gter) and the last one an Earth Treasure (Wylie: sa gter): *(a) The \\"Dagnang Yeshe Drawa\\" cycle (The Wisdom Nets of Pure Visions), such as the Troma teachings; *(b) The \\"Maha-Ati Yoga Zabcho Gongpa Rangdrol\\" cycle (The Profound Teachings on Naturally Self-liberating Enlightened Visions), such as the teachings of Chenrezig; *(c) The \\"Chonyid Namkhai Longdzo\\" cycle (the Vast Space Treasure from the Wisdom Sky of the Ultimate Nature), with teachings of Thekchod and Thodgal; and *(d) The \\"Khandro Nyingthig\\" (Heart Essence of the Dakini) cycle. There are four major cycles in the Dudjom Tersar of Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, which are all Mind Treasures (Wylie:dgongs gter): *(a) The \\"Tsokyi Thugthig\\" cycle, for the practices on the outer, inner, secret and innermost secret sadhanas of the Lama; *(b) The \\"Pudri Rekpung\\" cycle, for the practices of the Yidam; *(c) The \\"Khandro Thugthig\\" cycle, for the practices on the outer, inner, secret and innermost secret sadhanas of the Khandro; and *(d) The \\"Dorje Drolod\\" cycle.Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje - RangjungYesheWiki  More on Dudjom Rinpoche's Life & Works  * Dudjom Rinpoche - Rigpa Wiki * Dudjom Incarnation Line * Dudjom Tersar Bibliography * Light of Fearless Indestructable Wisdom: The Life and legacy of H.H.

He was the catcher for the Detroit Tigers on August 19, 1951, when St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck sent midget Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during an actual MLB game. The stunt was inspired by the James Thurber short story You Could Look It Up and Gaedel was allowed to bat when the Browns showed the umpires a legitimate baseball contract. Swift knelt on the ground to receive pitcher Bob Cain's offerings‚Äîit is this kneeling stance that is captured in the photo‚Äîand Gaedel took a base on balls. He was immediately replaced at first base by a pinch runner and he never appeared in a big league game again.

His 635 hits included 86 doubles, three triples and 14 home runs. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage. Swift was primarily a second-string catcher, although he started 83 of the 1945 world champion Tigers' official American League games. During the seven-game 1945 World Series, however, he started only in Game 3, with Paul Richards handling that assignment in the remaining six contests. Coaching and managing career Swift became a coach and minor league manager immediately upon the end of his playing career, coaching for the Tigers (1953‚Äì54; 1963‚Äì66), Kansas City Athletics (1957‚Äì59), and Washington Senators (1960). During the 1959 season, Swift filled in for Kansas City manager Harry Craft when Craft missed 15 games due to illness, and the Athletics won ten straight games and went 13‚Äì2. But Swift was bypassed at season's end when the A's changed managers.The Associated Press, October 17, 1966 Swift was in his second stint as a Detroit coach in when manager Chuck Dressen was felled by a mild heart attack during spring training. As acting manager, Swift led Detroit to a 24‚Äì18 record until Dressen was able to return on May 31. The next season, on May 16, 1966, Dressen suffered his second coronary in as many seasons. Again, Swift took the reins, but in mid-July (with the Tigers 32‚Äì25 under his command) he fell ill and was hospitalized during the All-Star game break for what appeared to be food poisoning. Tests revealed, however, that Swift was suffering from inoperable lung cancer. Coach Frank Skaff took over July 14 as the team's second acting manager and finished the campaign. Three months after stepping aside, on October 17, Swift died in Detroit at the age of 51. (Dressen had predeceased him, on August 10.)

It was, until 1998, part of Kent and is still ceremonially associated via the Lieutenancies Act. It forms part of the parish of Cliffe and Cliffe Woods. History Cliffe Woods is a village that has been built in an ancient area of woodland. Its roots are closely tied to the surrounding area which stretch back to pre-Roman times. At the time of the Norman conquest of England Cliffe Woods was part of the Hundred of Shamwell. Of the adjacent listed Domesday Book settlements, Cooling, Oakleigh and Haven, only Cooling had any recorded woodland resources in its inventory. Places- Domesday Book-Cliffe The woods were used for the pannage of pigs; ten pigs a year were paid to Wulfwin the local Anglo Saxon Lord. His Germanic name means wolf-friend. The Anglo Saxon overlord was Leofwine Godwinson who was the brother of King Harold.

Some other road names in the eastern part of Cliffe Woods are also historically connected to the manor.

She studied drama at the Stanhope-Wheatcroft Dramatic School, and worked in magazine journalism. She attended Radcliffe College and Boston University simultaneously as a special student.

In 1913, the year of the Exhibition of Modern Art in New York, she wrote an article Art Revolutionists on Exhibition, Review of Reviews, XLX11 (1913), 441-8 featuring C√©zanne, Picasso, Derain, Seurat, and other modernists. This was at a time when defense of modern art brought forth hostile criticism. Through the publicity she received from the article, she became acquainted with John Quinn.Portland Sunday Telegram, 1930, Laurence Paul Crowley Although she would become the dearest friend of Quinn's last years, at this stage she kept her distance because she had been warned Quinn was a dangerous man for a young woman to know.The Man From New York, John Quinn And His Friends, 1968, p. 148 In 1916 she began to publish narrative verse about the Adirondacks.

A side view of the centre carriage showing the Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph and the guards' section below The British Rail Class 306 was a type of electric multiple unit (EMU) introduced in 1949. It consisted of 92 three-car trains which were used on newly electrified suburban on the Great Eastern Main Line between and London Liverpool Street.  Overview  Class 306 trains were built to a pre-World War II design by Metro Cammell (Driving Trailer) and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (Driving Motor Brake and Trailer) and were equipped with English Electric traction equipment. Each carriage featured two sets of twin pneumatic sliding passenger doors, which could be opened by either the guard or the passengers, who could use buttons fitted inside and outside the doors. The order was placed by the LNER in 1938 but official delivery did not commence until February 1949. When built the trains were energised at 1,500 V direct current (DC) which was collected from overhead wires by a diamond pantograph located above the cab on the Motor Brake Second Open (MBSO) vehicle. In the early 1960s, the overhead wires were re-energised at 25,000 V alternating current (AC) (and 6,250 V AC in the London area) and the trains were rebuilt to use this very different electrical system. A transformer and rectifier unit was fitted to the underframe between the bogies of the intermediate carriage and the pantograph, now a more modern Stone Faiveley AMBR design, was moved to the roof of this carriage. Because this reduced the headroom inside the train, the guard's compartment was relocated to be directly below the pantograph. The trains were then re- numbered 001-092 with the last two digits of each carriage number (previously numbered in the LNER coaching series) the same as the unit number.  Operation Units being made up of three coaches, trains were usually formed on three units (nine coaches) although off-peak trains formed of only two units (six coaches) could be seen. This meant that the standard formation could carry 528 seated passengers plus another 696 standing, making 1,224 passengers, compared with about 1,000 passengers in the steam trains that they replaced. There is a record of a single three-coach unit hauling a Class 47 and train into Chelmsford after the locomotive failed on a London Liverpool Street to Norwich express.  Withdrawal and preservation  The Class 306 trains were withdrawn in the early 1980s, with 306017 preserved at Ilford depot. It has been repainted in a near original green livery, albeit with a yellow warning panel on the front to comply with present-day safety regulations. In the early 2000s, it was restored to operational condition by First Great Eastern.\\" What future for the last 306?\\" Rail Express issue 247 December 2016 pages 16-19 The unit was in store at MoD Kineton awaiting the resolving of issues such as asbestos contamination. The contamination was removed at Eastleigh Works and the unit was transferred by rail to the East Anglian Railway Museum in June 2011 for display as an exhibit, under a 4-year loan agreement from the National Railway Museum. It was moved to Locomotion: the National Railway Museum at Shildon in October 2018 so it can be assessed before restoration.

Denton led an expedition into the interior of northern New Jersey. He was one of the purchasers of what is known as the Elizabethtown Tract in 1664, in the area of (and surrounding) present day Elizabeth, New Jersey. In 1670 he wrote the first English-language description of the area. Biography Denton was born around 1626 in Yorkshire, England. He was the son of the Reverend Richard Denton, one of America's earliest Presbyterian ministers. Many Denton family genealogies claim Daniel's mother was Helen Windebank. In the 1640s he accompanied his father to Massachusetts, Connecticut, and eventually Long Island. In 1650 he was made town clerk of Hempstead, where his father was a pastor, and in 1656 he held the same position in the town of Jamaica. When his father relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia (or Halifax, Yorks, England), Denton remained on Long Island, and in 1664 he became one of the grantees of a patent at Elizabethtown, New Jersey. In 1665 and 1666 he served as justice of the peace in New York. Around 1659, Denton married Abigail Stevenson, who bore three children, and from whom he was divorced in 1672. The two elder children, Daniel and Abigail, remained with their father, while the infant daughter, Mercy, accompanied her mother, who subsequently remarried. Denton left New York for England in 1670 (which may have occasioned his divorce), and there he evidently participated in settlement enterprises and possibly in the newly acquired (by the English) fur trade.http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context;=libraryscience Denton Green, in Hempstead, NY is named for Reverend Richard Denton, Daniel Denton's father.Working Writing History Denton wrote and published A Brief Description of New-York: Formerly Called New-Netherlands in London in 1670. The work was a promotional tract designed to encourage English settlement of territories recently seized from the Dutch. It is one of the earliest English accounts of the geography, climate, economy, and native inhabitants of the region that includes present-day New York City, Long Island, Staten Island, and New Jersey. The tract is perhaps most famous for its early statement of Manifest Destiny: how \\"a Divine Hand makes way for them [the English settlers] by removing or cutting off the Indians, either by Wars one with the other, or by some raging mortal Disease.\\" Denton had emigrated to America in the 1640s and was involved in land speculation in the region. The linked article (below) gives a brief account of his life and career, and discusses his vision for the westward expansion of English culture and his representation of the American wilderness as an agrarian frontier. Though other explanations have been offered, some researchers would later conclude that it was Denton who lent his name to the naming of Denville, New Jersey.

History Kempenfelt Bay was named by John Graves Simcoe, the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, after Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, Royal Navy, who had served as a captain in the West Indies during the 1740s, at which time and place Lieutenant- Governor Simcoe's father Captain John Simcoe, also served. Ice fishing Ice fishing on Lake Simcoe begins in January and lasts until mid-March. Kempenfelt Bay usually freezes later in winter than the shallower sections of Lake Simcoe, such as Cook's Bay. There may be as many as 4000 huts during peak season, which must all be registered with the Ministry of Natural Resources. Yellow perch is the most commonly caught fish. Ice fishing on Lake Simcoe puts more than $28 million annually into the local economy.

Origins For many years the Midland had been wishing to extend its line from London St.Pancras to Manchester, via Derby and the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway. It was thwarted by the London and North Western Railway which already had a line from Manchester to London, via Birmingham and had built a branch line to Buxton. Meanwhile, The Great Northern Railway was also averse to more competition in the area, and the MS&LR; wished to expand southwards from its main line from Manchester, via Penistone, to Sheffield. The three joined forces in a series of tripartite agreements, which not being sanctioned by Parliament, were of doubtful legality. However James Allport, with some other Midland directors, met some members of the MS&L; board while surveying the area. Allport had worked for the MS&LR; and was familiar with the state of their finances. Since it was clear that the Midland was determined to enter Manchester, the MS&LR; agreed to a joint scheme. The Midland would take its line from Millers Dale as far as New Mills, and the MS&LR; would build its branch from Hyde on its main line to Hayfield via New Mills. Opening This agreement, including the Sheffield and Midland railway companies' Committee, was formalised in the \\"Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Act\\" of 6 August 1872http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=11446&CATLN;=3&accessmethod;=5&j;=1 In 1867 the line opened into Manchester Store Street, by then renamed London Road (now Piccadilly), which the MS&LR; shared with the LNWR. However, the Committee, seeking a more direct route, opened a line through Bredbury and Reddish in 1875. Increasing friction with LNWR led to the Cheshire Lines Committee being formed and when Manchester Central opened in 1880 trains were diverted at Romiley through Stockport Teviot Dale (as it was originally spelt).Radford, B., (1988) Midland Though The Peak Unicorn Books This entailed another new line, the \\"Manchester South District Railway Company\\" from Heaton Mersey to Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Although incorporated in 1873, there was a lack of interest on the part of the MS&LR; and the GNR (the Midland's partners in the CLC). It was therefore taken under the wing of the Sheffield and Midland Committee, with the Midland taking overall control in 1877. The line finally opened in 1880. Manchester Central - London St Pancras express at Chinley South Junction in 1957 However, by the end of the century congestion around Stockport had increased, and with speed limits, gradients and curves, the Midland looked for yet another route. The \\"New Mills and Heaton Mersey Railway\\" was authorised in 1897 from New Mills South Junction, between New Mills and Buxworth through Disley Tunnel. Modern times The earlier lines remain busy as the Hope Valley Line, as does that from New Mills through Disley Tunnel, where it branches to the old LNWR line from Buxton at Hazel Grove railway station into Stockport. However the stations from Hazel Grove to Manchester Central closed in 1967 and have practically disappeared, although the section of the railway between Didsbury and Manchester Central has reopened as a Metrolink line. There are hopes that this will extend further in the future through Heaton Mersey, and then leaving the alignment and heading into Stockport town centre. It became a corporate body, renamed the Great Central and Midland Joint Committee, on 22 July 1904. It was vested in British Transport Commission under Transport Act of 1947.

Family and early life Runcie's father was J. W. Cecil Turner, a Worcestershire county cricketer and a recipient of the Military Cross,Burke's Peerage who served as the bursar of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. She was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge and the London Guildhall School of Music.Carpenter, Humphrey, Robert Runcie: The Reluctant Archbishop. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1996. ] She married Robert Runcie on 5 September 1957. They had two children, James (born 1959) and Rebecca Runcie (born 1962). Later life In 1974, Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, was scheduled to retire in November. His successor was to be appointed by Harold Wilson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In April, Ladbrokes had already announced the betting odds as to who the next archbishop would be. Runcie, whose husband was at the time Bishop of St Albans and considered a likely candidate, was reported by Time magazine to have disapproved of the entire process: \\"It's revolting to turn important church affairs into a horse race.\\" The archbishop appointed was Donald Coggan, Archbishop of York, whom Ladbrokes had considered a leading candidate. That same year Robert Runcie was offered the position which Coggan had vacated, that of the Archbishop of York. She was reportedly set against moving from St Albans, Hertfordshire to York, North Yorkshire, resulting in her husband turning down the offer. Robert Runcie was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1979 and installed in the position in 1980. His acceptance of the position was reportedly delayed for weeks because of her alleged opposition to moving to Lambeth Palace. Runcie continued to give piano recitals in both the United Kingdom and the United States. According to an article in the Wrexham Evening Leader in 1983, she had raised over ¬£60,000 for charity through her recitals., Wrexham Evening Leader, 21 January 1983 She was interested in gardening and redesigned the gardens at Lambeth Palace (the London base of the Archbishop of Canterbury) in 1986. During the 1980s, the Early Diagnostic Unit for breast cancer of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust was threatened with closure. Runcie and June Kenton, owner of the Rigby & Peller shop, which has received a Royal Warrant for custom-making the brassieres of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, organised a petition for its continued existence, gathering thousands of signatures. Their petition was delivered to Norman Fowler, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who withdrew the notice of closure. In 1987, she was featured in articles of the Daily Star, a daily British tabloid newspaper. She took legal action against the publisher under English defamation law. The case reportedly concluded with a settlement in her favour. In 1988, she was named Honorary President of the Anglo-Armenian Association. Later years and death Runcie lived in St Albans (in which city she had lived in the 1970s during her husband's time as Bishop of St Albans) and taught piano privately and at St Albans School and St Albans High School for Girls. Robert Runcie died on 11 July 2000. Lady Runcie died on 12 January 2012, 11 days before her 80th birthday. References Sources * Carpenter, Humphrey, Robert Runcie: The Reluctant Archbishop.

In 2012 several research teams could not find more information, only in results published in 2017 it was demonstrated that Hesse-Wartegg was Austrian by birth, but adopted the US American citizenship in 1887. In 1878, he married the American opera singer Minnie Hauk (1851‚Äì1929). Starting 1889 they lived in their villa in Tribschen, near Lucerne, Switzerland. Throughout his life he went on travels worldwide. In 1872 he went to South-Eastern Europe, 1876 was his first trip to the US. Trips in the years 1880 to Tunis, 1881 to Egypt, and 1883 to Canada and Mexico followed, as well as several trips to the US. His next important travels were 1887 to Venezuela, and 1892 to Morocco and Spain. In 1894 he went on a trip around the world with South and East Asia as major stops: India, Singapore, Hong-Kong, China, Japan and Korea. In 1898 he was back to China.

According to the 2001 census it had a population of 1,063, reducing marginally to 1,060 at the 2011 census. The two small villages of Lower Stoke and Stoke (sometimes referred to as Upper Stoke) stand on low-lying fertile farmland that is at most 17 m above highwater. The farmland descends to the Stoke Saltings ‚Äì a maze of intricate channels and small islands beloved by wading birds. The church of Saints Peter and Paul is in Stoke; it was an appendage to the Manor of Great Hoo. The building contains some Norman and Early English work dating from 1175.

Retrieved 13 January 2013. Due to its low-lying nature, Stoke has often suffered flooding, such as in 1158, 1235, 1309, 1682, and 1735 when ploughmen were swept from their fields as the sea broke through. Also, in 1791, 1854, 1874, and 1897, Stoke was cut off from the Isle of Grain for a week. In 1720 Manor Farm was leased to Jacob Sawbridge, one of the South Sea Bubble directors. In 1732 William Hogarth overnighted at the 'Nag's Head' in Lower Stoke. Due to the shortage of beds he had to share a bed. There was a large airship base nearby at Kingsnorth from which patrols covering the North Sea were launched during World War I. The site is now covered by Kingsnorth Power Station. Stoke has a private unlicensed airfield, home to stoke flying club and previously part of Medway Microlights, now home to TwoTwoFly and a number of private microlights and social clubs. There is a current very active flying school based at the airfield teaching students to fly flex wing and fixed wing microlights. Stoke airfield is renowned in the aviation community as being a particularly challenging airfield to fly from. It is unique in its topography as it is situated parallel to marshes of the river Medway on one side of the runway. On the other side of the runway is an active rail line and high tension electricity pylons. The runway also has a curve along its entire length of approx 400 metres. Most general aviation pilots consider stoke airfield a place to land at least once. Common consensus is if a pilot can land safely at Stoke airfield then all other airfields are relatively straight forward in comparison. Future proposals In November 2011, Lord Foster published proposals to improve the transport system of South East England. Under these proposals, called the Thames Hub, new high-speed rail lines would be built connecting Kent and Europe with North London, and the North East and North West of England. The scheme would also involve the remodelling of the Thames Estuary, by the construction of a four-runway airport on the Isle of Grain, partially on land reclaimed from the estuary but including land at Allhallows and Lower Stoke. This plan is controversial.Medway Messenger, 4 November 2011, pp=5-7Kent Online- Fosters proposals Accessed 6 November 2010 Residents highlight hazards caused the presence of the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery with its 1400 tonnes of explosives, just off the Nore, and the natural gas terminals which import and temporarily store 20% of the UKs natural gas. In addition there are 300,000 birds that breed along the flight path. Aviation specialists point to the difficulty in fitting another airport in this crowded airspace.

A scene showed Choi entering the class, disguised as a new student. Choi sat beside a girl as she acted blatantly and introduced herself as a transfer student. With the girl's help, Choi identified the exceptional students, from the rebel to the most studious student and so on. Choi left the classroom shortly before the class started. The students ran back to their seats as the principal introduced their new teacher. They were shocked when Choi, who had disguised herself as a transfer student earlier on, was their new teacher. Young-hee was late for class and high-handedly sat down on a seat without greeting the teacher. Choi reprimanded her for her bad manners, but Young-Hee rebelled and walked out of the classroom. Choi then brought her to the staff room to call for her parents as Young-hee continued to rebel. As Choi called her father, she was shocked that Young-hee's father was the President of South Korea. Choi, being extremely shocked, told the President to call back in twenty five minutes without further ado. Hiccuping as always when she's nervous. The president later came to visit the school campus. All the students were looking out of the window and waved towards the president who stepped out of the limousine. Hiccup number 2 The president entered the staffroom and searched for Choi. Choi introduced herself, and told the president of his daughter's unruly behavior. As a punishment for not educating his daughter properly, Choi ordered the president to write a romance poem written by a Goguryeo-era king in Hanja a hundred times as homework, which was to be handed up the following day. Choi then ran into the storeroom and tried to pull herself together and fainted. The president headed for school the next day. Shortly after he had finished his 100th poem, a strong gust of wind blew some of his papers out of his limousine. The president stopped to search for his papers in vain. An officer suggested sending some of his men to find his papers which could have flown into the valley. The president said that he would rewrite the poem, but it was not possible to finish it in such a short time span. The president called Choi to apologise, but she dismissed it as a lie and told him to tell straight to the point and hung up. Back at his office, the president searched into Choi's biography and found out that she had only taught for six months at each school, from 1999 onwards. The next day, the president invited Choi for lunch. Choi appeared rather tensed up as she waited for the president. Lunch was served by the president's henchman as the president arrived. Just before they ate, the president handed up his work to Choi. Choi marked his work by drawing a whirl and wrote \\"Excellent Work\\" on his first page. Choi later confessed that the president made a mistake in one of his words, and a short argument followed as they stated their positions. The president called the Education Minister and confirmed his mistake. After lunch, the president took a stroll with Choi in his garden. Choi brought up the subject of playing the piano, but that was shortened when Choi also suggested that the president should wear a checkered tie and jeans just before she left. That night, Choi was taking a bus home when the president came to stalk on her. The bus driver stopped when two of the motorcades rode in front of him, forcing him to stop his bus. The bus driver was shocked when he saw the president boarding the bus. The passengers on the bus were treated to ride on the president's limousines to their designated destinations while Choi and the president would sit on the bus. The president confessed that his daughter, Young Hee, last smiled when she was six years old, and he wished to see that same smile again. Choi suggested by treating her a surprise party to stand a chance to achieve the result. One night, the president decided to go for a date with Choi. Several limousines arrived at her hostel as they headed for a bar. At the bar, Choi asked the president if he had tried moving around without bodyguards. As they were chatting, Shin, Choi's roommate, appeared. Shin was dressed in the army's uniform. The president was surprised to realise that Shin was a girl as she took off her cap. Shin shook the hands of the president enthusiastically, and told him that she would be back in a while in her best clothes. Choi later revealed that Shin was a transsexual. Both the president and Choi waited for the opportunity to slip off. They ran through the streets and to a musical concert to escape from his bodyguards who were looking for him. They finally came to a tavern to hide and claimed that they were refugees escaping from a few men who were looking for them. The bodyguards came to the tavern, and ordered the innkeepers to allow them to search for the president. The innkeeper's wife stated that the president visited it thirty years ago and turned away the bodyguards. As the bodyguards were confronting the innkeeper's wife, the innkeeper directed the president and Choi to hide in an underground compartment. The couple were just about to kiss when the innkeeper opened the compartment. Hiccup 3 The President and Choi later went to her flat, and they kissed there. A reporter took a photo of them which later became a national controversy. The president's popularity vote fell and Choi was frowned upon by her colleagues. A scene showed Young Hee being teased by three classmates as she was smoking a cigarette. One day, the president and Choi met at the school campus. The president was playing the piano when Choi entered. They talked about the romance poem which Choi had instructed the president to write earlier on. Choi continued that the president was to compose a new poem using his name. The president was suggesting the meanings of the characters of his first two names to Choi. As he was about to talk about the third character of his name, Choi gave a punch on his stomach as he blurted out \\"WOhhk!\\". The show ended with Choi holding the hands of the president as the couple walked into the president's office.

It is an adjustment to the cost of carry in the non-arbitrage pricing formula for forward prices in markets with trading constraints. Let F_{t,T} be the forward price of an asset with initial price S_t and maturity T. Suppose that r is the continuously compounded interest rate for one year. Then, the non-arbitrage pricing formula should be F_{t,T} = S_t cdot e^{r(T-t)} However, this relationship does not hold in most commodity markets, partly because of the inability of investors and speculators to short the underlying asset, S_t. Instead, there is a correction to the forward pricing formula given by the convenience yield c. Hence F_{t,T} = S_t cdot e^{(r-c)(T-t)} This makes it possible for backwardation to be observable. Example A trader has observed that the price of six-month (T) gold futures price (F) is $1,300 per troy ounce, whereas the spot price (S) is $1,371 per troy ounce. The (not compounded) borrowing rate for a six-month loan (r) is 3.5% per annum, and storage cost for gold is negligible (0%). Since we know we have the relation: F = S left[ 1 + (r - c) T right] What is the convenience yield implied by the futures price? From the formula above, we isolate the convenience yield (c), and we obtain: c = r + frac{1}{T} left(1 - frac{F}{S} right) c = 0.035 + frac{1}{0.5} left(1 - frac{1300}{1371} right)= 0.13857 = 13.9% (per annum, not compounded) For information, if we had a continuously compounded 6-month borrowing rate and if we were looking for the continuously compounded convenience yield, we would have the formula: F = S cdot e^{ (r-c) T } And the convenience yield would therefore be: c = r - frac{1}{T} lnleft( frac{F}{S} right) c = 0.035 - frac{1}{0.5} times lnleft( frac{1300}{1371} right) = 0.14135 = 14.1% (per annum, continuously compounded) Why should a convenience yield exist? Users of a consumption asset may obtain a benefit from physically holding the asset (as inventory) prior to T (maturity) which is not obtained from holding the futures contract. These benefits include the ability to profit from temporary shortages, and the ability to keep a production process running. One of the main reasons that it appears is due to availability of stocks and inventories of the commodity in question. Everyone who owns inventory has the choice between consumption today and investment for the future. A rational investor will choose the outcome that is best for himself. When inventories are high, this suggests an expected relatively low scarcity of the commodity today versus some time in the future. Otherwise, the investor would not perceive that there is any benefit of holding onto inventory and therefore sell his stocks. Hence, expected future prices should be higher than they currently are. Futures or forward prices F_{t,T} of the asset should then be higher than the current spot price, S_t. From the above formula, this only tells us that r-c >0. The interesting line of reasoning comes when inventories are low. When inventories are low, we expect that scarcity now is greater than in the future. Unlike the previous case, the investor can not buy inventory to make up for demand today. In a sense, the investor wants to borrow inventory from the future but is unable. Therefore, we expect future prices to be lower than today and hence that F_{t,T} < S_t. This implies that r-c < 0. Consequently, the convenience yield is inversely related to inventory levels.

He represented the Whig Party in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly, and was elected the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1844, serving under Governor William Owsley. In 1851, the Whigs nominated him for governor, but he lost to Lazarus W. Powell, his former law partner. Dixon represented Henderson County at the Kentucky constitutional convention of 1849. In this capacity, he ensured that strong protections of slave property were included in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850. Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did not stand for re- election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36¬∞30'. Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was loyal to the Union during the Civil War. He represented his county and his state in a number of failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876. Personal life Archibald Dixon was born near Red House, Caswell County, North Carolina on April 2, 1802.Congressional Biography He was the son of Captain Wynn and Rebecca Hart Dixon.Starling, p. 575 Both Dixon's father and grandfather fought in the Revolutionary War, the former enlisting at the age of sixteen. His grandfather, Colonel Henry Dixon, was commended by \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee for his service at the Battle of Camden. He was later killed at the Battle of Eutaw Springs. In 1805, Captain Dixon lost all of his property and moved the family to Henderson, Kentucky. Archibald Dixon was educated by his mother and attended the common schools of Henderson. In 1822, he began to study law in the office of James Hillyer.Kleber, p. 268 He was admitted to the bar in 1824, and commenced practice in Henderson. He became well known as a skilled defense attorney and was employed in a number of cases in Kentucky and Indiana. In 1834, Dixon married Elizabeth R. Cabell; the couple had six children. One of these was Rebecca Hart Dixon, second wife of future Kentucky governor John Y. Brown. Another daughter, Susan Bell Dixon, married Cuthbert Powell, a U.S. Representative from Virginia. One son, Henry, was elected a state senator in Kentucky, while another, Archibald, became a respected doctor in Henderson.McAfee, p. 59‚Äì60 Elizabeth Cabell Dixon died in 1852. On October 29, 1853, Dixon married Susan Peachy Bullitt. Bullitt was the paternal granddaughter of Alexander Scott Bullitt, the first lieutenant governor of Kentucky, and the maternal granddaughter of Dr. Thomas Walker, the first surveyor in the state of Kentucky.Starling, p. 576 Dixon and Bullitt had additional children. Political career Dixon was elected to represent Henderson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1830.Starling, p. 577 He served three consecutive one-year terms, leaving the House in 1833. Following this, he returned to his law practice and in 1835, partnered with Lazarus W. Powell.Memorial Record of Western Kentucky From 1836 to 1840, he represented Henderson, Daviess, and Hopkins counties in the Kentucky Senate. The next year, he returned to the Kentucky House, serving from 1841 to 1843. In 1844, Dixon was chosen as the Whig nominee for lieutenant governor on a ticket with William Owsley. Dixon defeated his opponent, William S. Pilcher, by more than 11,000 votes. At the expiration of his term, the Whig party considered nominating Dixon for governor, but instead chose the more experienced John J. Crittenden, who defeated Dixon's former law partner, Lazarus Powell. The voters of Henderson County chose Dixon to represent them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie by a vote of 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures to protect the rights of slaveholders in the new constitution.Rodgers, p. 99 Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850. The Whigs nominated Dixon for governor in 1851. The Democrats countered with Lazarus Powell. Still friends from their earlier days as law partners, the two often traveled together during the campaign. Cassius Marcellus Clay also entered the contest, representing the emancipationist wing of the Whig Party.Starling, p. 579 Clay drew about 6,000 votes, mostly from Whigs, and Powell won the election by a small majority. =In the Senate= On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay submitted a letter of resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay knew that if he resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.\\"The Kentucky Senator The Assembly acted according to Clay's plans. By a vote of 71‚Äì58, they chose Dixon over Democrat James Guthrie to assume Clay's seat effective September 1.McAfee, p. 59 However, Clay died on June 29, 1852. Because Dixon's commission stipulated an effective date of September 1, Governor Powell proceeded to name Clay's successor for the period until September 1. He chose Democrat David Meriwether, who served those two months, then, with respect to the original commission issued by the legislature (or by simply not returning to the Senate upon the commencement of the next session), effectively relinquished the seat to Dixon. After a lengthy Senate debate on the validity of his commission‚Äîit having been issued prior to Clay's death, with an effective date subsequent to the executive appointment of a successor‚ÄîDixon was sworn in on December 20, 1852. He served the remainder of Clay's term, but did not stand for reelection in 1854. A major issue during Dixon's tenure in the Senate was the admission of the Nebraska Territory to the Union. Specifically, the question hinged upon the issue of whether or not slavery would be allowed in the state. Under the Missouri Compromise, slavery was prohibited in the territory. Because of this, the southern states opposed its admission. In an attempt to allay southern fears, Stephen Douglas introduced a bill in January 1854 that included a provision that \\"all questions pertaining to slavery in the territories, and in the new states to be formed therefrom are to be left to the people residing therein, through their appropriate representatives.\\"Potter, p. 159 Douglas hoped to placate southerners with this language, which allowed for the possibility of legalized slavery in the potential state without specifically addressing the issue of the Missouri Compromise.Potter, et al. pp. 156‚Äì159 Southerners, however, saw that Douglas' attempt was unlikely to result in legalization of slavery. While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state, slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise as long as it remained a territory. If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution. Following this line of thought, Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise, the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36¬∞30'. After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones, Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16, 1854.Johannsen, p. 411 This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright, and two days later, he visited Dixon to discuss his position. Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise, but was ultimately convinced by Dixon's logic. He concluded the interview by exclaiming \\"By God, Sir, you are right. I will incorporate it in my bill, though I know it will raise a hell of a storm.\\"Potter, p. 160 Over the next several days, Douglas incorporated Dixon's suggestion and other pro-slavery measures into the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30, 1854.Potter, et al. p. 160‚Äì167 Later life On June 1, 1852, the stockholders of the Henderson and Nashville Railroad met at Madisonville, Kentucky and elected Archibald Dixon as president of the company. He served until his resignation in spring 1853.Perrin, p. 130 Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon loyally supported the Union during the lead-up to the Civil War. His sons, however, had Confederate sympathies.Bigham, p. 62 Dixon's home county of Henderson was one of the first counties in Kentucky to express their feelings about the secession crisis. The county called an assembly at the county courthouse on November 10, 1860. Dixon was elected chair of the meeting, and immediately expressed a pro-Union sentiment. A committee of five was appointed to draft resolutions stating Henderson County's position. At a second meeting one week later ‚Äì which Dixon also chaired ‚Äì the committee reported their pro-Union resolutions, which were approved.Starling, pp. 197‚Äì199 In an attempt to stave off the Civil War, Dixon participated in a convention of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At the outset of the war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro- Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro- Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.McElroy, p. 523‚Äì524 In March 1864, Dixon accompanied Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to an audience with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks into the ranks of the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession was little more than a face-saving gesture by Bramlette.Bigham, p. 70 Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery. Legacy Archibald Dixon is the namesake of Dixon, Kentucky. Notes Kleber, the more contemporary source, lists Dixon's first wife as Elizabeth Pollit, while Starling gives the name Elizabeth Robertson Cabell, a marriage date of 1832, and lists only five children. Genealogical records, including death certificates of Dixon's children, also give the first wife's name as Elizabeth R. Cabell, with a marriage date of March 13, 1834, in Henderson County, Kentucky.

It is located on the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line, north of , but is currently only served by services on the Croy Line.  History  Bishopbriggs was one of the original stations on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, opened in 1842. During the 1960s, the station was scheduled for closure under the Beeching Axe but a local campaign managed to save it, although the original station buildings and footbridge were demolished. They were replaced by a modular ticket office and waiting room, as well as a new footbridge. The ticket office and waiting room was replaced with a modern glass and steel building in 2002, of a similar design to that at Croy railway station.  Present day  There is no parking with very little provided on nearby streets. Services are provided by Abellio ScotRail, primarily using Class 170 Turbostar trains, however Class 156 Super Sprinter and Class 158 Express Sprinter DMU's are also used. From 2019/ 2020 Hitachi Class 385's will operate most services with a few exceptions (peak time trains to Perth for example) as electrification will only go as far as Alloa/ Dunblane.

It was released by Eagle-Lion Films, based on the 1946 novel of the same title written by Murray Forbes. Plot Just released from prison, John Muller (Paul Henreid) masterminds a holdup at an illegal casino run by Rocky Stansyck (Thomas Browne Henry). The robbery goes bad, and the mobsters capture some of Muller's men and force them to identify the rest before killing them. Stansyck has a reputation for tracking down and killing his enemies, no matter how long it takes, so Muller decides to leave town and hide. He takes an office job recommended by his law-abiding brother, Frederick (Eduard Franz), but quickly decides that working for a living is not for him. Joan Bennett as Bartok's secretary A chance encounter with dentist Dr. Swangron (John Qualen) reveals that Muller looks exactly like a psychoanalyst who works in the same building, Dr. Bartok, the only difference being a large scar on the left side of the doctor's face. Seizing the opportunity, he begins researching Bartok, even slipping into his office to examine his records. He is discovered by the doctor's secretary, Evelyn Hahn (Joan Bennett). She mistakes him for her employer and kisses him, but quickly realizes he is someone else. He persuades her to go out with him, though she has become embittered and claims to have given up any dreams of finding love. Muller sets out to impersonate Bartok, aided by the fact he studied psychoanalysis in medical school before dropping out. He takes a photograph of the doctor and uses it as a guide to cut an identical scar on his own face. Unfortunately, the developers of the photograph reversed the negative, so now Muller has the scar on the wrong side. He discovers the mistake only after he has already murdered Bartok and is preparing to dump the body in the river. He has no choice but to go through with the plan anyway. Luckily, no one (except the office cleaning lady, whose suspicions he manages to lull) notices the difference, not even Evelyn or Bartok's patients. Muller discovers \\"he\\" has a girlfriend, Virginia Taylor (Leslie Brooks), and that they frequent Maxwell's, a high class casino. It also turns out Bartok has been losing heavily. When a worried Frederick Muller tries to contact his brother, the trail leads to Bartok. The scar convinces Frederick that the man he sees is merely a lookalike. Evelyn, previously unaware of the switch (but now very suspicious), reveals that John Muller said he was going to Paris. Frederick Muller tells \\"Bartok\\" that his brother no longer has to hide; Stansyck was convicted for \\"income tax problems\\" and is scheduled to be deported. Afterward, Evelyn realizes that Muller is an imposter and that he must have killed the psychoanalyst. Though he admits to her he did, she does not turn him in to the police; instead she purchases a ticket to sail to Honolulu. Muller finds out and promises he will go with her, but she does not believe he would leave such an opportunity to enrich himself. Muller arranges for other doctors to take care of his patients and heads to the dock. There, however, he is intercepted by two men who want to discuss Bartok's $90,000 gambling debt. When Muller tries to break away, they fatally shoot him. Evelyn sails away, unaware that Muller lies dying on the dock.

He optioned a novel which had been suggested to him by director Steve Skeley and set up the project at the newly formed Eagle Lion. Henreid was keen to play the lead role, a gangster, as it was a different sort of part for him. He hired Daniel Fuch to write the script having admired the latter's work on Between Two Worlds. He wanted Evelyn Keyes for the lead but she was under contract to Columbia and Harry Cohn refused to loan her out, so Joan Bennett was cast instead. Henreid says Eagle Lion were unhappy with Skeley's direction, so they replaced him with Henreid. Reception Henreid says the film did well at the box office but the film was linked financially with three other movies from star producers. None of these did well so Henreid saw no profits. =Critical response= The New York Times critic Thomas M. Pryor called it \\"an adequate examination of an intelligent criminal type. There is not quite enough logic in the plot to enable it to stand up under scrutiny, but the story moves along briskly, the performances are sound and there is always the promise of more violence just around the corner.\\" Alain Silver in Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style notes \\"As in many of these B thrillers, the plot is contrived although the film's conclusion is as downbeat as any noir film since Scarlet Street.\\"* See also * List of films in the public domain in the United States References External links  * 1948 films 1948 crime drama films American films American crime drama films American black-and-white films English- language films Film noir Films based on American novels Gambling films Films directed by Steve Sekely Eagle-Lion Films films Films scored by Sol Kaplan 1948 drama films ","title":"Hollow Triumph"},{"id":"3501052","text":"Jackson Leonard Bostwick Jr. (born October 23, 1943) is an American actor, theatre director and film producer. He is best known for portraying Captain Marvel in the first season and beginning of the second season of the Shazam! television series in 1974‚Äì75. Early life, family and education Bostwick was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. His father, Jackson Leonard Bostwick Sr., was a neurosurgeon in Montgomery, Alabama. A photo of Bostwick's parents is seen in a movie in which he starred, The Prey. In the late 1980s, his father died in Montgomery. Bostwick holds a Masters of Fine Arts degree from University of Southern California, having been one of the original students in the program. He studied under acting coach Lurene Tuttle and eventually taught classes of hers. Career Bostwick was a contestant on the television game show, The Dating Game. He played the lead character role, a superhero, on the Saturday morning television series Shazam! and performed his own stunts. However, he was dismissed from the cast of Shazam! two installments into the second season and replaced in the role by John Davey. Bostwick had not shown up for a day's shooting, and the producers, Louis Scheimer and Norman Prescott, accused him of holding out for a higher salary. Bostwick explained that he had sustained an injury during the previous day's filming and had gone to seek medical treatment. In an interview, he stated, \\"I was at the doctor's office having my face and eye examined for an injury that I incurred doing a stunt on the previous day (during the filming of a flying takeoff sequence where the stunt boxes hadn't been reset properly).\\" He successfully litigated against Filmation Associates, which was forced to pay him for the remainder of his contract, plus residuals, including the entire second season. Bostwick appeared in several minor movie roles in the 1980s, such as a sentry in My Science Project and a guard in Tron. He played park ranger Mark O'Brien in the horror film The Prey (1984). Bostwick later returned to Alabama and taught theater at Auburn University where he directed several plays, including The Ballad of the Sad Cafe. He occasionally appeared in films in the 1990s and 2000s. Bostwick is the founder of the L.A.

It is a coastal bird inhabiting rocky, muddy and sandy shores and is often found around seabird colonies. They have greyish feathers, and the feathers on their wings are a darker shade. Dolphin gulls have a varied diet, eating many things ranging from mussels to carrion. The modern scientific name Leucophaeus scoresbii, together with the obsolete common name Scoresby's gull, commemorates the English explorer William Scoresby (1789‚Äì1857). Distribution The dolphin gull is found round the coasts of Chile, Argentina and the Falkland Islands. It is a vagrant to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It is found on rocky coasts and in the vicinity of other colonies of seabirds, slaughterhouses, sewage outflows and farmyards. Behaviour The dolphin gull is a scavenger and opportunistic predator. It feeds on carrion, offal, bird eggs, nestlings, marine invertebrates and other natural food. When humans disturb nesting seabirds, it takes advantage of the absence of adult birds to raid their vacated nests. It was found that excluding humans from areas where cormorants were nesting increased the reproductive success of the cormorants. It also takes advantage of the activities of marine mammals to scavenge for dead fish, placentae and faeces, which are a major attraction. Immature Dolphin gulls nest in small colonies of up to 200 pairs and are usually on low cliffs, sand or shingle beaches, headlands or marshy depressions. Two to three eggs are laid in December and the chicks fledge in March. The older chicks gather together in cr√®ches. Status The dolphin gull is listed by the IUCN as being of \\"Least Concern\\". This is because it has a very wide range, has a stable population and an estimated total population of 10,000 to 28,000 individuals.

This GPU features 3D acceleration based upon Direct3D 9.0 and OpenGL 2.0, a major improvement in features and performance compared to the preceding R200 design. R300 was the first fully Direct3D 9-capable consumer graphics chip. The processors also include 2D GUI acceleration, video acceleration, and multiple display outputs. The first graphics cards using the R300 to be released were the Radeon 9700. It was the first time that ATI marketed its GPU as a Visual Processing Unit (VPU). R300 and its derivatives would form the basis for ATI's consumer and professional product lines for over 3 years. The integrated graphics processor based upon R300 is the Xpress 200. Development ATI had held the lead for a while with the Radeon 8500 but Nvidia retook the performance crown with the launch of the GeForce 4 Ti line. A new high-end refresh part, the 8500XT (R250) was supposedly in the works, ready to compete against NVIDIA's high-end offerings, particularly the top line Ti 4600. Pre-release information listed a 300 MHz core and RAM clock speed for the R250 chip. ATI, perhaps mindful of what had happened to 3dfx when they took focus off their Rampage processor, abandoned it in favor of finishing off their next-generation R300 card. This proved to be a wise move, as it enabled ATI to take the lead in development for the first time instead of trailing NVIDIA. The R300, with its next- generation architecture giving it unprecedented features and performance, would have been superior to any R250 refresh. The R3xx chip was designed by ATI's West Coast team (formerly ArtX Inc.), and the first product to use it was the Radeon 9700 PRO (internal ATI code name: R300; internal ArtX codename: Khan), launched in August 2002. The architecture of R300 was quite different from its predecessor, Radeon 8500 (R200), in nearly every way. The core of 9700 PRO was manufactured on a 150 nm chip fabrication process, similar to the Radeon 8500. However, refined design and manufacturing techniques enabled a doubling of transistor count and a significant clock speed gain. One major change with the manufacturing of the core was the use of the flip-chip packaging, a technology not used previously on video cards. Flip chip packaging allows far better cooling of the die by flipping it and exposing it directly to the cooling solution. ATI thus could achieve higher clock speeds. Radeon 9700 PRO was launched clocked at 325 MHz, ahead of the originally projected 300 MHz. With a transistor count of 110 million, it was the largest and most complex GPU of the time. A slower chip, the 9700, was launched a few months later, differing only by lower core and memory speeds. Despite that, the Radeon 9700 PRO was clocked significantly higher than the Matrox Parhelia 512, a card released but months before R300 and considered to be the pinnacle of graphics chip manufacturing (with 80 million transistors at 220 MHz), up until R300's arrival. =Architecture= Block diagram of the \\"R300\\" chip. ATI R300 GPU The chip adopted an architecture consisting of 8 pixel pipelines, each with 1 texture mapping unit (an 8x1 design). While this differed from the older chips using 2 (or 3 for the original Radeon) texture units per pipeline, this did not mean R300 could not perform multi-texturing as efficiently as older chips. Its texture units could perform a new loopback operation which allowed them to sample up to 16 textures per geometry pass. The textures can be any combination of one, two, or three dimensions with bilinear, trilinear, or anisotropic filtering. This was part of the new DirectX 9 specification, along with more flexible floating-point-based Shader Model 2.0+ pixel shaders and vertex shaders. Equipped with 4 vertex shader units, R300 possessed over twice the geometry processing capability of the preceding Radeon 8500 and the GeForce4 Ti 4600, in addition to the greater feature-set offered compared to DirectX 8 shaders. ATI demonstrated part of what was capable with pixel shader PS2.0 with their Rendering with Natural Light demo. The demo was a real-time implementation of noted 3D graphics researcher Paul Debevec's paper on the topic of high dynamic range rendering.Debevec, Paul. Rendering with Natural Light, Author's web page, 1998 A noteworthy limitation is that all R300-generation chips were designed for a maximum floating point precision of 96-bit, or FP24, instead of DirectX 9's maximum of 128-bit FP32. DirectX 9.0 specified FP24 as a minimum level for conforming to the specification for full precision. This trade-off in precision offered the best combination of transistor usage and image quality for the manufacturing process at the time. It did cause a usually visibly imperceptible loss of quality when doing heavy blending. ATI's Radeon chips did not go above FP24 until R520. ATI's Rendering with Natural Light promo demo The R300 was the first board to truly take advantage of a 256-bit memory bus. Matrox had released their Parhelia 512 several months earlier, but this board did not show great gains with its 256-bit bus. ATI, however, had not only doubled their bus to 256-bit, but also integrated an advanced crossbar memory controller, somewhat similar to NVIDIA's memory technology. Utilizing four individual load-balanced 64-bit memory controllers, ATI's memory implementation was quite capable of achieving high bandwidth efficiency by maintaining adequate granularity of memory transactions and thus working around memory latency limitations. \\"R300\\" was also given the latest refinement of ATI's innovative HyperZ memory bandwidth and fillrate saving technology, HyperZ III. The demands of the 8x1 architecture required more bandwidth than the 128-bit bus designs of the previous generation due to having double the texture and pixel fillrate. Radeon 9700 introduced ATI's multi-sample gamma-corrected anti-aliasing scheme. The chip offered sparse-sampling in modes including 2√ó, 4√ó, and 6√ó. Multi-sampling offered vastly superior performance over the supersampling method on older Radeons, and superior image quality compared to NVIDIA's offerings at the time. Anti-aliasing was, for the first time, a fully usable option even in the newest and most demanding titles of the day. The R300 also offered advanced anisotropic filtering which incurred a much smaller performance hit than the anisotropic solution of the GeForce4 and other competitors' cards, while offering significantly improved quality over Radeon 8500's anisotropic filtering implementation which was highly angle dependent. On March 14, 2008, AMD released the 3D Register Reference for R3xx.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Radeon R3xx 3D Register Reference Guide, X.org website, March 14, 2008. =Performance= Radeon 9700's architecture was very efficient and much more advanced compared to its peers of 2002. Under normal conditions it beat the GeForce4 Ti 4600, the previous top-end card, by 15‚Äì20%. However, when anti-aliasing (AA) and/or anisotropic filtering (AF) were enabled it would beat the Ti 4600 by anywhere from 40‚Äì100%. At the time, this was quite special, and resulted in the widespread acceptance of AA and AF as truly usable features.High-end Graphics Card Overview, By Punit Lodaya, Jan 14 2005, Techtree.com India Besides advanced architecture, reviewers also took note of ATI's change in strategy. The 9700 would be the second of ATI's chips (after the 8500) to be shipped to third-party manufacturers instead of ATI producing all of its graphics cards, though ATI would still produce cards off of its highest-end chips. This freed up engineering resources that were channeled towards driver improvements, and the 9700 performed phenomenally well at launch because of this. id Software technical director John Carmack had the Radeon 9700 run the E3 Doom 3 demonstration.IGN Advertisement The performance and quality increases offered by the R300 GPU are considered to be one of the greatest in the history of 3D graphics, alongside the achievements GeForce 256 and Voodoo Graphics. Furthermore, NVIDIA's response in the form of the GeForce FX 5800 was both late to market and somewhat unimpressive, especially when pixel shading was used. R300 would become one of the GPUs with the longest useful lifetime in history, allowing playable performance in new games at least 3 years after its launch.Weinand, Lars. VGA Charts VII: AGP Update Summer 2005, Tom's Hardware, July 5, 2005. Further releases A few months later, the 9500 and 9500 PRO were launched. The 9500 PRO had half the memory bus width of the 9700 PRO, and the 9500 was also missing (disabled) half the pixel processing units and the hierarchical Z-buffer optimization unit (part of HyperZ III). With its full 8 pipelines and efficient architecture, the 9500 PRO outperformed all of NVIDIA's products (save the Ti 4600). Meanwhile, the 9500 also became popular because it could in some cases be modified into the much more powerful 9700. ATI only intended for the 9500 series to be a temporary solution to fill the gap for the 2002 Christmas season, prior to the release of the 9600. Since all of the R300 chips were based on the same physical die, ATI's margins on 9500 products were low. Radeon 9500 was one of the shortest-lived product of ATI, later replaced by the Radeon 9600 series. The logo and box package of the 9500 was resurrected in 2004 to market the unrelated and slower Radeon 9550 (which is a derivative of the 9600). =Refreshed= In early 2003, the 9700 cards were replaced by the 9800 (or, R350). These were R300s with higher clock speeds, and improvements to the shader units and memory controller which enhanced anti- aliasing performance. They were designed to maintain a performance lead over the recently launched GeForce FX 5800 Ultra, which it managed to do without difficulty. The 9800 still held its own against the revised FX 5900, primarily (and significantly) in tasks involving heavy SM2.0 pixel shading. Another selling point for the 9800 was that it was still a single-slot card, compared to the dual-slot requirements of the FX 5800 and FX 5900. A later version of the 9800 Pro with 256 MiB of memory used GDDR2. The other two variants were the 9800, which was simply a lower-clocked 9800 Pro, and the 9800 SE, which had half the pixel processing units disabled (could sometimes be enabled again). Official ATI specifications dictate a 256-bit memory bus for the 9800 SE, but most of the manufacturers used a 128-bit bus. Usually, the 9800 SE with 256-bit memory bus was called \\"9800 SE Ultra\\" or \\"9800 SE Golden Version\\". Alongside the 9800, the 9600 (a.k.a. RV350) series was rolled out in early 2003, and while the 9600 PRO didn't outperform the 9500 PRO that it was supposed to replace, it was much more economical for ATI to produce by way of a 130 nm process (all ATI's cards since the 7500/8500 had been 150 nm) and a simplified design. Radeon 9600's RV350 core was basically a 9800 Pro cut in half, with exactly half of the same functional units, making it a 4√ó1 architecture with 2 vertex shaders. It also lost part of HyperZ III with the removal of the hierarchical z-buffer optimization unit, the same as Radeon 9500. Using a 130 nm process was also good for pushing up the core clock speed. The 9600 series, all with high default clocking, was shown to have quite a bit of headroom by overclockers (achieving over 500 MHz, from 400 MHz on the Pro model). While the 9600 series was less powerful than the 9500 and 9500 Pro it replaced, it did largely manage to maintain the 9500's lead over NVIDIA's GeForce FX 5600 Ultra, and it was ATI's cost-effective answer to the long-time mainstream performance board, GeForce4 Ti 4200. During the summer of 2003, the Mobility Radeon 9600 was launched, based upon the RV350 core. Being the first laptop chip to offer DirectX 9.0 shaders, it enjoyed the same success of the previous Mobility Radeons. The Mobility Radeon 9600 was originally planned to use a RAM technology called GDDR2-M. The company developing that memory went bankrupt and the RAM never arrived, so ATI was forced to use regular DDR SDRAM. Undoubtedly there would have been power usage savings, and perhaps performance gains with GDDR2-M. In fall 2004, a slightly faster variant, the Mobility Radeon 9700 was launched (which was still based upon the RV350, and not the older R300 of the desktop Radeon 9700 despite the naming similarity). Later in 2003, three new cards were launched: the 9800 XT (R360), the 9600 XT (RV360), and the 9600 SE (RV350). The 9800 XT was slightly faster than the 9800 PRO had been, while the 9600 XT competed well with the newly launched GeForce FX 5700 Ultra.Gasior, Geoff. NVIDIA's GeForce FX 5700 Ultra GPU: Third time's the charm?, The Tech Report, October 23, 2003. The RV360 chip on 9600 XT was the first graphics chip by ATI that utilized Low-K chip fabrication and allowed even higher clocking of the 9600 core (500 MHz default). The 9600 SE was ATI's answer to NVIDIA's GeForce FX 5200 Ultra, managing to outperform the 5200 while also being cheaper. Another \\"RV350\\" board followed in early 2004, on the Radeon 9550, which was a Radeon 9600 with a lower core clock (though an identical memory clock and bus width). Worthy of note regarding the R300-based generation is that the entire lineup utilized single-slot cooling solutions. It was not until the R420 generation's Radeon X850 XT Platinum Edition, in December 2004, that ATI would adopt an official dual-slot cooling design.Wasson, Scott. ATI's Radeon X850 XT graphics cards: Canadian double-wide?, The Tech Report, December 1, 2004. =New interface= Also in 2004, ATI released the Radeon X300 and X600 boards. These were based on the RV370 (110 nm process) and RV380 (130 nm Low-K process) GPU respectively. They were nearly identical to the chips used in Radeon 9550 and 9600, only differing in that they were native PCI Express offerings. These were very popular for Dell and other OEM companies to sell in various configurations; connectors: DVI vs. DMS-59, card height: full-height vs. half- height. Later the Radeon X550 was launched, using the same chip as Radeon X300 graphics card (RV370).

In ancient Greek poetry and Latin poetry, an iambic trimeter is a quantitative meter, in which a line consists of three iambic metra. Each metron consists of the pattern  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì , where \\"‚Äì\\" represents a long syllable, \\"u\\" a short one, and \\"x\\" an anceps (either long or short). Resolutions were common, especially in the first two metra of the line, so that any long or anceps syllable except the last could be replaced by two short syllables (see for example Euripides#Chronology), making a total of 13 or more syllables. It is the most common meter used for the spoken parts (as opposed to the sung parts) of Ancient Greek tragedy, comedy, and satyr plays. It is also common in iambus or 'blame poetry', although it is not the only meter for that genre.Douglas E. Gerber, Greek Iambic Poetry, Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 1 In the accentual-syllabic verse of English, German, and other languages, however, the iambic trimeter is a meter consisting of three iambs (disyllabic units with rising stress) per line, making a line of six syllables. Greek =Basic form= The iambic trimeter derives its name from its essential shape, which is three metrical units (hence \\"trimeter\\") which are each basically iambic in form. The iambic metron has the following shape (where \\"x\\" is an anceps, which may be either long or short, \\"‚Äì\\" is a long syllable, and \\"u\\" is a short one): : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  The trimeter simply repeats this structure three times, with the resulting shape as follows: : x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  As always, the last syllable of a verse is counted as long even if naturally short (brevis in longo). An example of the structure: : : : u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :(Euripides, Hippolytus 1053) =Caesura and bridge= A caesura (break between words) is usually found after the fifth or seventh element of the line. In the example above, it is found after the fifth element, as so (withÔø§representing the caesura): : u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  ‚ÄìÔø§‚Äì u ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  Finally, Porson's Law is observed, which means here that if the anceps of the third metron is long, there cannot be a word- break after that anceps. The second anceps is free from this constraint, because a word-break at that point would be a main caesura. =Resolution= The Greek iambic trimeter allows resolution, allowing more variety. In tragedy, resolving the anceps elements is rare, except to accommodate a proper name, but resolution of the long elements is slightly more common. In comedy, which is closer to casual speech, resolution is fairly common. In both tragedy and comedy, though, the third metron is usually left alone; resolution in the final metron of the line is rare. In tragedy, resolutions are virtually never consecutive, and two instances in the same line are rare. When resolution occurs, the resulting two shorts are almost always within the same word-unit. Latin iambic senarius The iambic trimeter was imitated in Latin by 2nd century BC comic playwrights such as Plautus and Terence, where it is known as the iambic senarius. It is the most commonly used meter in their plays, especially in Terence, and it is the only meter which was used purely for dialogue without musical accompaniment. It was the preferred meter of the Roman fabulist Phaedrus in the first century AD. In Latin the basic meter was as follows: : x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì x ‚Äì  x ‚Äì u ‚Äì  That is to say, the third and seventh elements, which were always short in Greek, were anceps (either long or short) in Latin; in fact they are long 60% of the time, while the Greek anceps syllables (the first, fifth, and ninth elements) are long in 80-90% of lines.Gratwick, A.S. (1993) Plautus: Menaechmi (Cambridge), p. 44. As in the Greek trimeter, any long or anceps syllable except the last could be replaced with a double short syllable (u u). As in Greek, there was usually (though not always) a caesura (word-break) after the fifth element. An example of a Latin iambic senarius (from the prologue to Plautus' Aulularia) is the following: :Ne qu√≠s mir√©tur qu√≠ sim, pa√∫cis √©loqu√°r. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :\\"In case anyone should wonder who I am, let me explain in a few words.\\" A difference between Latin and Greek iambics was that the Latin senarius was partly accentual, that is to say the words were arranged in such a way that very often (especially in the first half of the verse), the word accents coincided with the strong points of the line, that is the 2nd, 4th, 6th etc. elements of the verse. Thus even in lines where nearly all the syllables were long as in the above verse, it is possible to feel the iambic rhythm of the line. Accentual-syllabic iambic trimeter In English and similar accentual- syllabic metrical systems, a line of iambic trimeter consists of three iambic feet. The resulting six-syllable line is very short, and few poems are written entirely in this meter. The 1948 poem \\"My Papa's Waltz\\" by Theodore Roethke uses the trimeter: :...We romped until the pans :Slid from the kitchen shelf; :My mother's countenance :Could not unfrown itself. William Blake's \\"Song ('I Love the Jocund Dance')\\" (1783) uses a loose iambic trimeter that sometimes incorporates additional weak syllables: :I love the jocund dance, :The softly breathing song, :Where innocent eyes do glance, :And where lisps the maiden's tongue. :I love the laughing gale, :I love the echoing hill, :Where mirth does never fail, :And the jolly swain laughs his fill. =As a component of common meter= The English iambic trimeter is much more frequently encountered as one-half of the common meter, which consists of alternating iambic tetrameter and trimeter lines: :O God Our help in ages past :Our hope in years to come :our shelter from the stormy blast :And our eternal home :::Isaac Watts, a paraphrase of Psalm 90,\\" Our God, Our Help in Ages Past, Another example, from the American poet Emily Dickinson: :If you were coming in the fall :I'd brush the summer by :With half a smile and half a spurn, :As housewives do a fly. :::Emily Dickinson, \\"If You Were Coming in the Fall\\" Citations Types of verses ","title":"Iambic trimeter"},{"id":"3501093","text":"The OC Fair & Event Center (OCFEC) is a event venue in Costa Mesa, California.

It was funded by both the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Communities and Local Government. It was merged into the Design Council on 1 April 2011. Function CABE was the government's advisor on architecture, urban design and public space in England. Its job was to influence and inspire the people making decisions about the built environment. It championed well-designed buildings, spaces and places, ran public campaigns and provided expert, practical advice. It worked directly with architects, planners, designers and clients. Structure CABE's board members ‚Äì its commissioners ‚Äì were appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. There were 16 commissioners in total. Its chair was Paul Finch, a former chair of the Design Council. CABE's chief executive was Richard Simmons. One of CABE's main functions was design review: expert independent assessments of building schemes at an early stage. CABE reviewed schemes of national importance, that had a significant impact on the local environment, or which set standards for the future. Its design review panel consisted of around 40 expert advisors drawn from England's architectural, built environment and creative community. CABE was known as a 'non-statutory consultee' in the planning process, meaning that planners and others should heed CABE's advice when making decisions, but were not obliged to do so. CABE's main office was situated in a large tower block built in 1968 (and designed by Richard Seifert) near Drury Lane. History CABE was the direct successor body to the Royal Fine Art Commission, originally established in 1924. Originally intended to be called \\"Commission for Architecture\\", Sir Terry Farrell successfully argued for \\"Built Environment\\" to be added to the new commission's name and purview. CABE was established in August 1999. It came about from the Urban Task Force set up in 1998, chaired by Richard Rogers. Some CABE's functions, including design review and localism and planning, were merged with the Design Council on 11 April 2011 (the Design Council is a registered charity). CABE's first chairman was Stuart Lipton who was also Chief Executive of the property developer Stanhope. Private Eye's architectural correspondent complained that this represented a conflict of interest. =Former commissioners= * Paul Morrell * Ben Page * Ian Ritchie Activities CABE set up a dedicated design review panel to provide expert advice on the quality of designs for the government's proposed eco-towns. The panel reviewed the proposals for: Whitehill-Bordon in Hampshire; Rackheath in Norfolk; North-West Bicester in Oxfordshire; and St Austell in Cornwall. CABE launched a campaign to push for greater investment in green infrastructure. The 'Grey to Green' campaign and report, Grey to Green: how we shift funding and skills to green our cities, argued that a switch was needed in public spending from grey projects, like road building and heavy engineering projects, to green schemes, like street trees, parks, green roofs and waterways. It developed the Building for Life scheme and Manual for Streets. Other regions CABE's remit did not cover Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The equivalent body in Scotland is Architecture and Design Scotland, the successor body to the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland. The equivalent body in Wales is the Design Commission For Wales. In Northern Ireland, equivalent work is undertaken by the Ministerial Advisory Group for Architecture and the Built Environment (MAG) which was established in 2007 under the Northern Ireland Policy for Architecture and the Built Environment.Architecture and the Built Environment for Northern Ireland The successor to CABE, Design Council CABE, operates nationally and internationally. Abolition In 2010 the Government announced that it would withdraw public funding from CABE, merging some functions into a new organisation with the Design Council, Design Council CABE (a registered charity). As in the transition from the Royal Fine Art Commission to CABE, the combined organisation had a much reduced staff and while it continued its Design Review and Localism and Planning roles, a review was conducted into the organisation and its role in delivering emerging proposals for the planning system.Design Council CABE See also * Construction Industry Council * Landscape Institute References External links * Official Web page * Archived website =Video clips= * About CABE English architecture Interested parties in planning in England Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Defunct public bodies of the United Kingdom Organizations established in 1999 Organisations based in the City of Westminster 1999 establishments in England Design Council ","title":"Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment"},{"id":"3501099","text":"Ann Baskett, actress, born 1928, RADA scholar, starred in the 1952 BBC production of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen opposite Peter Cushing.

Although Margaret Kelly Michaels was prosecuted and convicted, the decision was reversed after she spent five years in prison. An appellate court ruled that several features of the original trial had produced an unjust ruling and the conviction was reversed.State of New Jersey v. Margaret Kelly Michaels (1993). 264 N.J. Super. 579; 625 A.2d 489 The case was studied by several psychologists who were concerned about the interrogation methods used and the quality of the children's testimony in the case. This resulted in research concerning the topic of children‚Äôs memory and suggestibility, resulting in new recommendations for performing interviews with child victims and witnesses.  Accusation  In April 1985, a nurse took the temperature of a 4-year-old boy with a rectal thermometer and the boy said, \\"That's what my teacher does to me at nap time at school.\\" The comment was reported to the local authorities, and all the children at the Wee Care Nursery School were questioned. Social workers and therapists collected testimony from 51 children from the day care center. During the interviews, children made accusations such as that Michaels forced them to lick peanut butter off of her genitals, that she penetrated their rectums and vaginas with knives, forks and other objects, that she forced them to eat cakes made from human excrement and that she made them play duck, duck, goose while naked. Michaels was indicted for 235 counts of sexual offenses with children and youths. She denied the charges. Upon conviction, when asked whether they actually believed some of the more sordid claims from the children, prosecutors Glenn Goldberg and Sara McArdle answered \\"No\\" and \\"Oh, absolutely\\" simultaneously. But when journalist Dorothy Rabinowitz asked about some of these bizarre elements, such as knives that left no scars, Goldberg replied, \\"What is there left to know? The jury has spoken. She's convicted.\\" Trial The trial began on June 22, 1987. \\"The prosecution produced expert witnesses who said that almost all the children displayed symptoms of sexual abuse.\\" Prosecution witnesses testified that the children \\"had regressed into such behavior as bed-wetting and defecating in their clothing. The witnesses said the children became afraid to be left alone or to stay in the dark. They also testified that the children exhibited knowledge of sexual behavior far beyond their years.\\" Some of the other teachers testified against her. The defense argued that Michaels had not had the opportunity to take the children to a location where all of the alleged activities could have taken place without being noticed. The jury was not shown the transcripts of the interrogations of the children that produced the accusations. After nine months, the case went to the jury for deliberation. At that time, 131 counts remained, including charges of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, endangering the welfare of children, and making terroristic threats. The jury deliberated for 12 days before Michaels was convicted of 115 counts of sexual offenses involving 20 children. On August 2, 1988, Michaels was sentenced to 47 years in prison, with no possibility for parole for the first 14 years. The judge \\"said the facts in the case were sordid, bizarre and demeaning to the children.\\" Michaels \\"told the judge that she was confident her conviction would be overturned on appeal.\\" Release In March 1993, after five years in prison, Michaels' appeal was successful and she was released. The New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision and declared \\"the interviews of the children were highly improper and utilized coercive and unduly suggestive methods.\\" A three-judge panel ruled she had been denied a fair trial because \\"the prosecution of the case had relied on testimony that should have been excluded because it improperly used an expert's theory, called the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome, to establish guilt.\\" In June 1993, the State Supreme Court refused to hear the prosecutor's appeal of the decision. In February 1994, \\"the court heard arguments...about the admissibility of evidence.\\" In December 1994, the prosecution dropped the attempt to retry the case \\"because too many obstacles had been placed in the way of a successful retrial.\\" The major hurdle was that \\"if the state decided to reprosecute Michaels, it must produce 'clear and convincing evidence' that the statements and testimony elicited by the improper interview techniques are reliable enough to warrant admission.\\" \\"While the Supreme Court stopped short of instructing the prosecutor to drop the case, the court made it clear that it believed the children's testimony would not hold up.\\" Interrogation methods During Michaels‚Äô appeal, researchers Maggie Bruck and Stephen Ceci prepared an amicus brief regarding the case that pointed out several problems with the children‚Äôs testimony that was the primary evidence. Some of the issues that were addressed were the role of interviewer bias, repeated questions, peer pressure, and the use of anatomically correct dolls in contaminating the children‚Äôs testimony. These interview techniques could have led to memory errors or false memories. In addition to the problems with the interviews themselves, the fact that there were no recordings of initial interviews meant that important evidence was missing; therefore, it was not possible to determine the origin of some of the information that children reported (i.e., it could have been suggested to them by interviewers in the early interviews. Interviews from the Wee Care Nursery School and McMartin preschool trials were examined as part of a research project on the testimony of children questioned in a highly suggestive manner. Compared with a set of interviews from Child Protective Services, the interviews from the two trials were \\"significantly more likely to (a) introduce new suggestive information into the interview, (b) provide praise, promises, and positive reinforcement, (c) express disapproval, disbelief, or disagreement with children, (d) exert conformity pressure, and (e) invite children to pretend or speculate about supposed events.\\"  See also  * Day care sexual abuse hysteria * List of wrongful convictions in the United States  References   External links  * Frontline: Innocence Lost * Wee Care Nursery School at the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance Day care sexual abuse allegations in the United States Education in Essex County, New Jersey Overturned convictions in the United States Child care companies ","title":"Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial"},{"id":"3501136","text":"Guntur (); is a city and the administrative headquarters of Guntur district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The city forms a part of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region, administered by APCRDA. It is a municipal corporation and also the headquarters of Guntur East and Guntur West mandals in Guntur revenue division. census of India the city is the third most populous in the state with a population of 1,225,436. Guntur is classified as a Y-grade city as per the Seventh Central Pay Commission. It forms a part of Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Region, an important industrial corridor in the country. The city is known for its chilli, cotton and tobacco exports and has the largest chilli market yard in Asia.  Etymology  The earliest reference to the present name of the city can be dated back to the period of Ammaraja‚ÄìI (922-929 CE), the Vengi Eastern Chalukyan King. It also has its appearance in another two inscriptions dated 1147 AD and 1158 AD. In Sanskrit, Guntur was referred to as Garthapuri. \\"Garthapuri\\" or \\"Guntlapuri\\" translates to \\"a place surrounded by water ponds\\". The settlement might have been near a pond, a \\"gunta\\" in Telugu; hence, :gunta uru\\" translates to \\"pond village\\" in Telugu. Another source refers to \\"kunta\\" (a land measuring unit) which may have transformed to \\"kunta uru\\" and later to \\"Guntur\\".  History  The earliest recorded reference of Guntur comes from the Idern plates of Ammaraja I (922‚Äì929 CE), the Vengi Chalukyan king. The inscriptions stones in the Agastyeshwara temple in 'Naga Lipi' (an ancient script) dates back to about 1100 CE. It is located in Old Guntur and is considered one of the most famous temples in the city. It is said that Agastya built the temple in the last Treta Yuga around the swayambhu linga and hence it has this name. The 'Nagas' were said to have ruled the region at that time. R.Agraharam and Old Guntur areas are considered to be the older parts of the city. The region has been historically known for Buddhism and the first Kalachakra ceremony performed by Gautama Buddha himself. The place of Sitanagaram and the Guttikonda caves are referred in the ancient texts (Vedic puranas) going back to the Treta Yuga and Dwapara Yuga. Old inscriptions of Satavahana period are found in Chebrolu area south of the city. With the arrival of the Europeans in the late sixteenth century the city attained national and international significance. The French shifted their headquarters from Kondavid Fort to here in 1752, probably because of the ample availability of water due to the two large tanks. This settlement formed the nucleus of the modern city. The Nizams of Hyderabad and Hyder Ali also ruled the city until it came under British rule in 1788. French astronomer, Pierre Janssen observed the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868 and discovered helium, from Guntur in Madras State, British India. It was made the headquarters of a district named after it that was abolished in 1859, only to be reconstituted in 1904. The city rapidly became a major market for agricultural produce from the surrounding countryside due to the opening of the railway link in 1890. The expansion continued post independence as well and was concentrated in what is now called \\"New Guntur\\", with many urban areas such as Brodipet, Arundelpet and suburban areas like Pattabhipuram, Chandramouli Nagar, Sita Rama nagar, Brindavan Gardens, etc. In 2012, the city limits were expanded with the merger of surrounding ten villages, namely Nallapadu, Pedapalakaluru, Ankireddipalem, Adavitakkellapadu, Gorantla, Pothuru, Chowdavaram, Etukuru, Budampadu and Reddypalem.  Geography  Guntur Region from a satellite. Guntur is located at . It has an average elevation of and is situated on the plains. There are few hills in the surrounding suburban areas and Perecherla Reserve Forest on the north west. The city is around to the west of the Bay of Bengal on the east coast of India. The Krishna delta lies partly in the Guntur district. There are other smaller rivers and channels in the region such as Guntur Channel, Chandravanka, Naagileru, Guntur Branch Canal etc. As quoted in NASA's website \\"it is typical of the wider deltas along the southeast coast of India (known as the Coromandel Coast).

Club career Snelders was born in Westervoort, Gelderland. He started his career with FC Twente but is mostly remembered in Scotland, especially for his spell at Aberdeen following his move for ¬£300,000 in summer 1988. A successful replacement for Jim Leighton, he had a very good first season at Pittodrie, winning the Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year in 1989. He saved Anton Rogan's penalty in Aberdeen's penalty shootout win over Celtic in the 1990 Scottish Cup Final. After fracturing a cheekbone in a collision with Ally McCoist of Rangers in 1991, he was unavailable for the club's vital winner-takes-all match against the Gers in May of that year, with inexperienced understudy Michael Watt unable to prevent a 2‚Äì0 defeat. Snelders had also played in the Aberdeen side that beat Rangers to win the 1989 Scottish League Cup Final, but tasted defeat against the same opponents in that tournament's 1988 and 1992 editions and in the 1993 Scottish Cup Final, and was the regular goalkeeper as the Dons finished runners-up to Rangers in five of his seven full league campaigns. Midway through the one of the campaigns in which the team was not challenging for honours (1991‚Äì92), Snelders was sent off for an incident of violent conduct on the pitch; his reaction to a penalty being awarded to Keith Wright of Hibernian was to strike the forward to the head, followed by kicking the ball over the stand and out of the stadium. His makeshift replacement, defender Brian Irvine, saved the spot-kick, only for Aberdeen to miss a penalty of their own and concede the winning goal in the last minute. The other unsuccessful year (1994‚Äì95) concluded with a play-off to prevent the club being relegated for the first time in their history, which was averted. He made 290 appearances for the club in all competitions. Having fallen behind Watt in the Aberdeen order, Snelders moved on to rivals Rangers for ¬£300,000 in early 1996.Silverware, smashed bones and soaps: Theo Snelders reflects on a decade spent in Scottish football, The Herald, 25 September 2016 As a confirmed backup player, initially to Andy Goram followed by Lionel Charbonnier then Stefan Klos, he made just 18 appearances for the Glasgow club (two in the UEFA Champions League against Dutch side Ajax) before he was released in 1999. He played two seasons at MVV before he retired from playing and became a goalkeeping coach in his native Netherlands with FC Twente. International career Snelders was a member of the Dutch squad at the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship. He made his only full international appearance on 22 March 1989, against the Soviet Union. He kept a clean sheet as the Dutch won 2‚Äì0, with the goals coming from a Marco van Basten diving header and a Ronald Koeman penalty. Snelders was an unused substitute with the Dutch team at the 1994 World Cup.

Religious skeptics question religious authority and are not necessarily anti-religious but skeptical of specific or all religious beliefs and/or practices. Socrates was one of the most prominent and first religious skeptics of whom there are records; he questioned the legitimacy of the beliefs of his time in the existence of the Greek gods. Religious skepticism is not the same as atheism or agnosticism, and some religious skeptics are deists (or theists who reject the prevailing organized religion they encounter, or even all organized religion).  Overview  The word skeptic (sometimes sceptic) is derived from the middle French sceptique or the Latin scepticus, literally \\"sect of the sceptics\\". Its origin is in the Greek word skeptikos, meaning inquiring, which was used to refer to members of the Hellenistic philosophical school of Pyrrhonism, which doubted the possibility of knowledge. As such, religious skepticism generally refers to doubting or questioning something about religion. Although, as noted by Schellenberg the term is sometimes more generally applied to anyone that has a negative view of religion. The majority of skeptics are agnostics and atheists, but there are also a number of religious people that are skeptical of religion. The religious are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some stated belief. Some philosophers put forth the sheer diversity of religion as a justification for skepticism by theists and non- theists alike. Theists are also generally skeptical of the claims put forth by atheists. Michael Shermer wrote that religious skepticism is a process for discovering the truth rather than general non-acceptance. For this reason a religious skeptic might believe that Jesus existed while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles (see historicity of Jesus). Thomas Jefferson's The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, a literal cut and paste of the New Testament that removes anything supernatural, is a prominent example.  History  = Ancient history = Ancient Greece was a polytheistic society in which the gods were not omnipotent and required sacrifice and ritual. The earliest beginnings of religious skepticism can be traced back to Xenophanes. He critiqued popular religion of his time, particularly false conceptions of the divine that are a byproduct of the human propensity to anthropomorphize deities. He took the scripture of his time to task for painting the gods in a negative light and promoted a more rational view of religion. He was very critical of religious people privileging their belief system over others without sound reason. Socrates' conception of the divine was that the gods were always benevolent, truthful, authoritative, and wise. Divinity was to operate within the standards of rationality. This critique of established religion ultimately resulted in his trial for impiety and corruption as documented in The Apology. The historian Will Durant writes that Plato was \\"as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma.\\" Democritus was the father of materialism in the West, and there is no trace of a belief in any afterlife in his work. Specifically, in Those in Hades he refers to constituents of the soul as atoms that dissolve upon death. This later inspired the philosopher Epicurus and the philosophy he founded, who held a materialist view and rejected any afterlife, while further claiming the gods were also uninterested in human affairs.Epicurus, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy In the poem De rerum natura Lucretius proclaimed Epicurean philosophy, that the universe operates according to physical principles and guided by fortuna, or chance, instead of the Roman gods. In De Natura Deorum the Academic Skeptic philosopher Cicero presented arguments against the Stoics calling into question the character of the gods, whether or not they participate in earthly affairs, and questions their existence. In ancient India, there was a materialist philosophical school called the CƒÅrvƒÅka, who were known as being skeptical of the religious claims of Vedic religion, its rituals and texts. A forerunner to the Charvaka school, philosopher Ajita Kesakambali, did not believe in reincarnation. = Early modern history = Thomas Hobbes took positions that strongly disagreed with orthodox Christian teachings. He argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \\"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\\". Voltaire, although himself a deist, was a forceful critic of religion and advocated for acceptance of all religions as well as separation of church and state. In Japan, Yamagata Bant≈ç (d.1821) declared that \\"in this world there are no gods, Buddhas, or ghosts, nor are there strange or miraculous things\\".  Modern religious skepticism  The term has morphed into one that typically emphasizes scientific and historical methods of evidence. There are some skeptics that question whether religion is a viable topic for criticism given that it doesn't require proof for belief. Others, however, insist it is as much as any other knowledge, especially when it makes claims that contradict those made by science. There has been much work since the late 20th century by philosophers such as Schellenburg and Moser, and both have written numerous books pertaining to the topic. Much of their work has focused on defining what religion is and specifically what people are skeptical of about it. The work of others have argued for the viability of religious skepticism by appeal to higher-order evidence (evidence about our evidence and our capacities for evaluation), what some call meta-evidence. There are still echoes of early Greek skepticism in the way some current thinkers question the intellectual viability of belief in the divine. In modern times there is a certain amount of mistrust and lack of acceptance of religious skeptics, particularly towards those that are also atheists. This is coupled with concerns many skeptics have about the government in countries, such as the U.S.A., where separation of church and state are central tenets.

In 2006, Cain was written out of the series when Hordley left the show; however, the door was left open for a return, which occurred when Hordley returned to the cast in February 2009. Cain's main storylines have focused on discovering his uncle Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) is his father; his relationship with his cousin Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins); discovering he is Debbie's (Charley Webb) father; his affair and subsequent relationship with Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb); being attacked in a whodunit storyline where his assailant was eventually revealed to be his father; being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm; supporting his nephew Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) after discovering Aaron was sexually abused by his father Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers) as a child; reuniting with his and Chas's mother Faith Dingle (Sally Dexter); his relationship with local vicar Harriet Finch (Katherine Dow Blyton); building up a relationship with his children; and being blackmailed by DI Malone (Mark Womack) to do drug runs for him. Storylines =2000‚Äì2006= Cain arrives for his cousin Butch's (Paul Loughran) funeral, blaming Chris Tate (Peter Amory) and police officer Angie Reynolds (Freya Copeland) for his death. Wanting revenge, he seduces Angie's daughter, Ollie (Vicky Binns), and manipulates her into believing that he cares, despite sleeping with her mother. When Angie dumps Cain, he has her fired, has a steamy session with Ollie and pushes Len Reynolds (Peter Martin) down a flight of stairs. Determined to get her own revenge, Angie goes along with Cain's plan to rob a Tate Haulage truck but she sets him up and is fatally injured in a car crash. He begs her to tell him she loves him but she tells him how much she loves her children. As a teenager, Cain had a fling with Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins), and attacks her when he learns that she is dating Chris. Paddy (Dominic Brunt) and Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor) foster Debbie Jones (Charley Webb), who befriends the Dingles. When Cain sees a picture of Debbie's biological mother, he realises that Debbie is his and Charity's daughter. He blackmails Charity, threatening to tell Chris, so Charity tells him and spends time with Cain, eventually rekindling their affair and Chris catches them. Cain and Debbie leave the village but return so he can clear his name and admit his love for Charity; she ends the relationship when she realises she cannot live with him while on bail, due to pregnancy. She moves on to Tom King (Ken Farrington), and they plan to marry. Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), Tom's daughter-in-law, hires Cain to make Tom think Charity has been unfaithful but Charity clears her name and leaves the village. Sadie and Cain end up in bed; when she rejects him, he kills her dog. Cain and Debbie move into Butler's Farm with Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher). Debbie briefly dates Andy, resulting in a daughter Sarah. Unlike Debbie, who lets Emily adopt Sarah, Cain bonds with her. Cain attempts to hurt Debbie by having a brief relationship with her friend/girlfriend Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman) and ensuring that Debbie sees them together. Debbie and Sadie help Jasmine terminate her pregnancy, knowing that Cain wanted to be a father. Cain and Sadie damage the King's River Show Home; when Sadie rejects him, he tells Jimmy that she paid him to vandalise the house and they are together. When Sadie confronts him, Cain threatens to tell Matthew as well so Sadie tells Ashley that Cain got Jasmine pregnant. The Dingles throw him out and allow Debbie to return. Cain leaves the village, unaware that he has damaged the show home's gas pipe. Despite Jimmy's temporary repair, the house explodes and kills Dawn Woods (Julia Mallam), Noreen Bell (Jenny Tomasin) and David Brown (Peter Alexander). Cain tells the police that he killed Alice so Samson will not lose both parents and his family forgive him (including Debbie), and Sadie bails him out. They plan revenge on Tom and Matthew King (Matt Healy) by plotting to kidnap Tom. Debbie tells Cain that Sadie paid for Jasmine's abortion; after a violent confrontation, Cain follows Sadie and kidnaps her and Tom. Chas (Lucy Pargeter) confronts him but he denies any knowledge of Tom and Sadie's disappearance. With the police closing in, Cain takes them to an abandoned factory and switches cars. They follow him to a quarry, where Cain sends his car over a cliff (with Tom and Sadie supposedly inside). While the police search the lake, Cain disguises himself as an officer. After shooting Sadie, Cain forces Tom to get Chastity to deliver the ransom. Debbie begs Cain to let her go with him and they part in tears. Cain gives some of the ransom money to an old woman, asking her to post it to Debbie. Surprised by the woman's honesty, Cain realises he wants to change. At the airport, he gets on a plane and leaves Sadie behind, telling her that he does not want to continue as he was. He leaves Debbie a message that he has left Sadie, asking her to ignore what others say and telling her that he loves her more than he shows. On her 18th birthday, Cain sends her a silver watch. =2009‚Äì= In February 2009, Cain returns to support his daughter Debbie as she is on remand for murdering Shane Doyle (Paul McEwan). He is arrested and hires a solicitor for Debbie who tells him that Andy is refusing her access to Sarah. Cain supports his daughter Debbie in her successful custody battle and tempts Maisie Wylde (Alice Coulthard), despite her parents' disapproval. After having a relationship with Maisie, Cain flirts with Faye Lamb (Kim Thomson). When he refuses to return money to Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Carl King (Tom Lister), they beat him up. Cain dislikes Debbie's boyfriend, Michael, and learns that he is marrying his pregnant fianc√©e. Cain and Debbie arrive at the church and learn that Charity is Michael's fiancee. When Michael learns about Charity's past (and that she is not pregnant), he jilts her. Debbie invites Charity to stay with her, despite Cain's opposition. Charity and Carl plan to rob Cain but Cain and Debbie catch them and throw Charity out (after giving her the money she tried to steal). Cain returns on 22 December with gifts for Debbie and Sarah, reconciling with Charity on Christmas Day after she proposes to him. Cain finds Mark Wylde's (Maxwell Caulfield) wallet in the woods after Mark is reported missing and blackmails his son Nathan (Lyndon Ogbourne). Sam's (James Hooton) dog, Alfie, digs up the body Nathan frames his half-brother and Natasha frames her stepson, Ryan Lamb (James Sutton) for Mark's murder, and Ryan is wrongfully convicted. Cain tells Maisie that Nathan and Natasha paid him to keep quiet and he cannot help Ryan without incriminating himself. After seeing Nathan lie in the witness box, Cain kidnaps him. When Maisie learns what her mother and brother did, she calls the police and tells them that her mother killed her father. In April 2011, Charity ends her relationship with Cain again after he has a one-night stand with Faye and sleeps with Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny). When he rejects her, she tells him she is pregnant so he \\"persuades\\" her to have an abortion but her pregnancy is too far advanced. Amy tells him and Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins) that she had the abortion so Cain has an affair with Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) and tells John. Amy gives birth to Cain's son, Kyle, in a cemetery; thinking he is dead, she panics and leaves him in a phonebox. Hazel Rhodes (Pauline Quirke) and Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox) find him, and call an ambulance. Amy admits being his mother and Cain realises she lied about the abortion. Cain dislikes Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) so when Priya (Fiona Wade) shows an interest in him, Cain takes advantage of this. Jai accuses Cain of stealing from his parents' house and causing their father's road accident. Cain sends Jai a photo of Priya asleep nude and persuades her to report Jai to the police for assaulting her. Priya forgives Cain until she learns he is the father of Amy's baby and slept with Moira. Cain is arrested when Jai reports his threats to the police but released with a caution. Debbie throws him out and Cain confronts John, Moira, Chas and Amy before leaving the village. Cameron later finds Jai standing over Cain, now badly injured, and calls an ambulance. Cain recovers, claiming that Jai attacked him until Zak admits that he was responsible; he tells the police that a man he knew from Spain attacked him. Cain saves Holly Barton's (Sophie Powles) life when she relapses on heroin and angers her brother, Adam (Adam Thomas). Confronting Cain at the garage, he demands an apology for what Cain has done to his family but Cain refuses. So Adam sets the garage on fire and leaves Cain to die but returns later. Cain's nephew Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) begs Cain to tell the police the fire was an accident, and Cain threatens Adam. In 2012, Moira and Cain get together and on New Year's Day 2013, they announce their relationship by kissing in the Woolpack. In April, Moira learns that she is pregnant but miscarries. Despite this, their relationship gets stronger and Cain moves in with Moira and Adam, who adjusts to the situation. Cain is hospitalised after eating a rotten wolf, an incident which only further endears him to Moira. In August, Debbie reunites with Cameron, angering Cain and Charity. Cain takes Cameron hostage and threatens to kill him but Debbie stops him harming Cameron. Reluctantly, Cain relents but warns Cameron that he'll be watching him. In October 2013, Cain rushes back from holiday when he learns that Cameron has laid siege to The Woolpack and is holding Debbie and Chas hostage. On his return, he is relieved to find Debbie and Chas safe and Cameron died in the siege. Cain supports Debbie through the trauma and eventually nurses her back to health. Cain resumes his romance with Moira, but later that month the man who terrorized Laurel Thomas arrives at the Bartons, injured. The man is revealed to be Ross Barton (Michael Parr), Moira's nephew, who assisted Cain in a crime he committed during his absence. Cain is not happy to see Ross but allows him to stay with him and Moira and gives him a job at the garage. However, Cain and Moira's life is intruded on furthermore when Ross's father, James (Bill Ward), follows him to Emmerdale accompanied by his other sons, Pete (Anthony Quinlan) and Finn (Joe Gill). Cain and James instantly clash especially when Moira tells Cain that James made a pass at her in March 2014. Cain confronts James and warns him that he is keeping an eye on him. James later apologizes to Cain. Later that month, Moira proposes to Cain and he accepts. The couple get engaged and, assisted by Chas in wedding preparations, Cain and Moira set a date for 15 May 2014. They get married although James gets drunk at their reception. In December 2014, Cain comes home from a business trip to France with bad pain in his head. He ignores it for a week, at which point he collapses and is found by Charity, who takes him to hospital. Cain is told he has a brain aneurysm and needs an operation immediately, but leaves the hospital. Returning to the village, he walks by the river but falls in after a dizzy spell. He is found by Vanessa Woodfield and Kirin Kotecha while they were walking out. Eventually, Cain recovers from his condition but is aware that the aneurysm will still exist inside his brain. Cain saves his sister, Belle Dingle after she tries to kill herself, and she is diagnosed with possibly Schizophrenia, following recent events which led to the teenager killing her best friend a year previously. Since Belle's diagnosis, Cain has been supportive towards his sister. In June 2015, Cain and Moira discover that Charity was pregnant when she was sentenced to prison and the baby, Moses Dingle, could possibly be Cain's. Cain visits Charity in prison and questions if he is the father of her child. It is later revealed that Ross Barton is Moses's father, following a one-night stand with Charity. Cain soon finds out that Ross and Debbie have been having an affair and to stop Debbie from running away with Ross, he tells her that Ross is Moses's father. Debbie's wedding day approaches and Cain threatens Ross and warns him to leave Debbie alone. Debbie marries Pete Barton, but her affair with Ross is discovered on a recorded confession which Ross made on his mobile phone during a conversation with Debbie. Just as everyone finds out, a helicopter comes crashing through the roof of the Village Hall, leaving everyone's lives at risk. Cain and Pete carry Debbie out of the Village Hall, as she is discovered under some debris and therefore begins to fight for her life, due to serious injuries following the crash. But, Cain realises that Kyle is trapped in the debris, and goes in to rescue him, but Kyle hides from him. Cain manages to convince him to come out. Kyle eventually comes out, and Cain rescues him, just before the entire village hall collapses. In February 2016, Cain was the third person to learn that Aaron was raped by his father, Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers) when he was a child. The first was Aaron's ex-lover Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley), 2 weeks later, Chas was the second person after Aaron told her. After Chas told him about Aaron's abuse, Cain drove to Gordon's house when he plans revenge on Gordon for what he did to Aaron. The next day, Cain goes to Gordon's house and punches Gordon when he returns. Cain ties him up and forces Gordon to drink vodka and take Chas' sleeping pills to make it look like he was trying to take his own life. Gordon riles Cain up so much that he picks up a chair intending to beat Gordon with it, but Aaron and Chas arrive in the nick of time to stop him. Aaron informs Cain that he wants to deal with this his way by calling the police on his father. As Aaron is giving his statement, Cain, instructed by Chas, has told the rest of the Dingles, Moira, Paddy and Adam about Aaron. When he is being questioned, Gordon tells the police that Cain tried to make him take his own life. The police arrive at Butlers to question Cain, but Chas and Moira give him an alibi. Despite Cain's newfound role as protector of the Dingle name, due to Zak's excommunication, Chas criticizes him, citing that he hasn't bothered even glancing at Aaron since finding out he was abused and is ashamed of him. Cain tells her that this is utter rubbish and that he still loves Aaron, the problem being that whenever he looks at him, it reminds him \\"of what a sick, perverted man Gordon is\\". Alongside this newfound fatherly duty, Cain also tries to protect Debbie from long term lover (and Moria's nephew) Ross after she leaves the village and he will stop at no lengths to get in contact with her. Cain also supports Lisa as she celebrates turning 60 by divorcing Zak. However, Cain later tries being civil with his estranged father due to his troubles with Chas. Cain was in the pub when Chas accidentally reveals to everybody in the pub that Gordon abused Aaron when he was a child. After the police tell Aaron that they can't get Sandra to back Aaron up, Cain goes to the scrapyard and finds Aaron taking his frustrations out on a car. Cain tells Aaron that he loves him and wants to see Gordon face justice but not at the cost of what it is doing to Aaron, so persuades him to drop the case. Back at the woolpack Cain is present when the police tell Aaron that another of Gordon's victims has come forward. In March 2016, Cain's car got stolen, Cain thought it was Charity or Ross. Then Cain and Moira track the car with somebody drive it. Cain and Moira chase after the driver before confronting the driver who is Holly. The following months, Cain went to the court to support Aaron. In May 2016, Cain discovers from Chas that Gordon is dead. Later, Chas went to the garage and asks Cain if he was involved of Gordon's death, Cain says no but he believes Robert could be involved. Cain and Chas went to the pub and told Aaron that they believe Robert could have had Gordon killed by paying somebody to do it but later, reveals on the next day that Gordon took his life by hanging himself. In July 2016, after Holly relapses and becomes addicted to drugs again Moira confronts her drug dealer but falls onto a used needle causing her to believe she has contracted HIV. With Moira's help, Holly becomes clean; however, Cain is disgusted when he finds out Holly caused Moira to become contracted with HIV after he finds Moira's tablets. After that Cain walked out he tried to run James off the road the day after he walked out on Moira and kissed Charity at The Woolpack then after he moved in with Lisa Dingle and Belle Dingle at Wishing Well Cottage and after Moira ordered a divorce. Cain saved Charity's life when she tried to find Belle after she went missing following a mental breakdown, she ended up with broken ribs after a run-in with Holly's ex-boyfriend/ drug dealer Dean, back at the garage Cain and Charity kissed then slept together. The following day Cain stood up for Charity in front of Zak and Lisa. Then he called Charity back to the garage he pulled her in and kissed her; then they had sex. The day after that Cain said that was another one-off. Charity said 'You'll be sending me dirty Emojis before the day's out'. They had sex again in a car but Holly Barton knocked on the garage door. They got rid of Holly. After fetching drinks for him and Charity drinks she joked 'Same time tomorrow?'. In February 2017, Cain was shocked when his mother Faith returns to the village and help Robert and Aaron's family for his nephew and Robert's wedding, but turns bad news when his mother was accused of the murder of her husband. In October 2018, after Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) leaves Debbie at the altar on their wedding day, Cain threatens to kill Joe if he ever shows his face again around the village and goes up to Home Farm to search for answers but sees Joe walking back into the grounds after deciding against Graham's wishes to stay away. Cain punches Joe in the face causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock which kills him. Creation and casting In 2000, series producer Kieran Roberts introduced three new members of the Dingle family. The new characters made their first appearance at the funeral of Butch Dingle (Paul Loughran). Among them were Cain (Jeff Hordley), son of Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and Faith Dingle (Gillian Jephcott). Cain's cousin/one-time lover is Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins), and Zak's brother is Shadrach (Andy Devine). In April 2006, it was announced that Jeff Hordley had quit, however, the door was left open for a possible return in the future. In January 2009, it was announced that the character would be brought back in April that year after a three-year break. Speaking to Digital Spy about his return, Hordley said \\"I am really looking forward to returning to Emmerdale. The storylines that led to Cain's return are in keeping with his character and a perfect way to bring him back to the heart of the Dingle clan where he belongs\\". Hordley later said that he initially turned down a return but when he was approached on the matter he approved of the storyline and felt like \\"the time was right for me\\". Development =Characterisation= The character was labelled a \\"ruthless hard man\\", a \\"bad boy\\" and a \\"villain\\" by Digital Spy. Itv.com also described Cain as the \\"village pariah\\" and commented that he likes \\"being in charge\\" but dislikes \\"being made a fool of\\". What's on TV described him saying \\"a villain through and through, Cain Dingle will even cross his own family if it's worth his while!\\" Cain has also been described as the \\"village's unmistakable bad boy\\". When casting a new family for the serial one character specification described Cain's earlier tenure, saying: \\"much in the early Cain Dingle mould, ruthless, unscrupulous, and extremely promiscuous\\". Hordley said Debbie is Cain's Achilles' heel who he would \\"move mountains for\\" while \\"women are his other Achilles heel, but he won't move mountains for them\\". =Relationship with Charity Dingle= Upon Cain's return to the village, he and Charity reunite. Charity proposes on Christmas Day to which Cain accepts. Even though they're family. Hordley explained that the couple can't see they are made for each other as they are \\"so busy competing and getting one up on each other\\" which means that they fail to see that they are \\"the same\\". Atkins said Charity asked Cain to marry her to \\"prove a point\\". On a storyline in which Cain and Charity plan to carry out a scam Atkins said it would make the audience question \\"will they/won't they pull it off\\" before adding that it is a \\"Bonnie and Clyde storyline but without the deaths!\\" Hordley said he and Atkins \\"spark off and bounce off\\" each other which Hordley added made it \\"easier for me to act with her\\". Atkins added that she felt \\"having a good rapport in that way both on and off screen is vital\\". Digital Spy described the relationship as \\"volatile\\". =Reintroduction= Hordley said Cain's return is his way of \\"coming back unannounced\\", and added, \\"Cain's style is to surprise people, but there has been involvement in the storyline as he was the one to get Debbie released from prison\\". Hordley felt that upon Cain's return \\"everyone's moved on\\". He added that Cain \\"looks down on\\" Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), and that Aaron is \\"like a little puppy looking up to Cain, thinking that his uncle's the bee's knees\\". He also stated, \\"There's a great relationship going to build there. Aaron stands for everything Cain was ‚Äì he's a younger version of him and Cain recognises that. There's definitely lots of undiscovered territory there\\". On Cain and Chas's relationship Hordley also felt that it \\"hasn't really been explored\\"; even though they have been in the serial a long time together the relationship is still \\"non-existent\\". This left \\"so much scope\\" and \\"with Aaron being involved, too. There certainly should be more involvement and I'm hopeful there will be\\". On Cain's relationship with Debbie, Hordley said the relationship was \\"true to the character's roots\\". He added that Cain will \\"do whatever it takes to look after that girl. If there's one Achilles heel of Cain, it's his daughter. It's his weakness and he'll move mountains for her\\". Hordley also felt that Cain's relationship with Charity was \\"going to be a big thing\\" and that he expected there would be \\"a lot of stuff between Charity, Debbie and Cain\\". =Who attacked Cain?= In 2011, it was announced that Cain would become part of a \\"major\\" storyline where he is attacked by a \\"mystery\\" assailant in a \\"whodunit\\"-style storyline. The storyline developed after Cain had made several enemies throughout the year and forced one of his enemies to \\"take the ultimate revenge\\". Producers stylised the plot as a \\"whodunit storyline\\" which would keep viewers guessing as to whom the attacker was. The potential suspects were revealed to be John Barton (James Thornton), Moira Barton (Natalie J Robb), Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson), Amy Wyatt (Chelsea Halfpenny), Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). A spokesperson for the serial stated that the characters had become \\"sworn enemies\\" of Cain, all \\"pushed to the limit after months of manipulation and destruction\\". Emmerdales executive producer Stuart Blackburn said that the climax of Cain's actions \\"will be one of our most dramatic episodes this year\\" as viewers decide who took \\"matters into their own hands\\". The attacker was revealed to be Zak Dingle, Cain's father.  Reception  At the 2002 British Soap Awards Hordley was nominated for \\"Sexiest Male\\" and \\"Villain of the Year\\".

In the text, Burgos also adds quotes from the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Mayans. Those epigraphs foreshadow the narrative of the testimonial of Menchu.

Life and works Gerald Barry was born in Clarehill, Clarecastle, County Clare, in the Republic of Ireland. He was educated at St. Flannan's College, Ennis, County Clare. He went on to studied music at University College Dublin, in Amsterdam with Peter Schat, in Cologne with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel, and in Vienna with Friedrich Cerha.Axel Klein: Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert (Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 1996), p. 353. Barry taught at University College Cork from 1982 to 1986. Growing up in rural Clare, he had little exposure to music except through the radio: \\"The thing that was the lightning flash for me, in terms of Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, would have been an aria from a Handel opera, from Xerxes maybe, that I heard on the radio. I heard this woman singing this, and bang ‚Äì my head went. And that was how I discovered music.\\"http://www.musicalcriticism.com/interviews/barry-0312.shtml (Interview with Liam Cagney) \\"Barry's is a world of sharp edges, of precisely defined yet utterly unpredictable musical objects. His music sounds like no one else's in its diamond-like hardness, its humour, and sometimes, its violence.\\" He often conceives of material independently of its instrumental medium, recycling ideas from piece to piece, as in the reworking of Triorchic Blues from a violin to a piano piece to an aria for countertenor in his television opera The Triumph of Beauty and Deceit: > It seemed to me unprecedented: the combination of the ferociously objective > treatment of the material and the intense passion of the working-out, and > both at an extreme of brilliance. And the harmony ‚Äì that there was harmony > at all, and that it was so beautiful and lapidary. It functions, again, > irrationally, but powerfully, to build tension and to create structure.

Collections like these were among my first feverish encounters with music as a boy. I fell in love with pieces like Martial Steps and The dog barks, the caravan passes on.

Boswell (born 1953) is a comic book writer and artist, illustrator, and photographer based in Vancouver, British Columbia who has worked in the comics industry. He is the creator of the series Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman. Boswell grew up in London, Ontario, and Hamilton and Dundas, Ontario. He studied film at Oakville, Ontario's Sheridan College, where he graduated in 1974. After graduation, Boswell attempted to earn a living as a cartoonist, and his first full-page comic, \\"Heart Break Comics\\", was published in The Georgia Straight from 1977‚Äì1978. Boswell moved to Vancouver in 1977, and in 1978, he launched Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman. Another title Boswell created is Ray-Mond. Boswell's influences include film directors Josef von Sternberg and Luis Bu√±uel, composer Hector Berlioz, comedians Buster Keaton, and W.C. Fields, and humourist Robert Benchley, as well as early Hollywood and European cinema stars, and he often features references in his work. He has written a number of screenplays for movies, none of which have been made. In 2011 Boswell was inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame.  Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman  Boswell based the character of Reid Fleming on a childhood bully with the same name.Boswell entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Reid employs extremely aggressive means in delivering his dairy products. His supervisor is Mr. Crabbe, whose head is unusual in shape, and who has little, if any, patience with Reid Fleming. If it was up to him, Reid would have been fired years ago, but Reid's employer, Mr. O'Clock, prefers to just dock Reid's pay for all the milk trucks he wrecked in his recklessness (8 at the start of the story); O'Clock's reticence to fire Reid may be due to the fact that he is Reid's biological father, as implied in issue #5 (#6 under the Deep Sea Comics imprint); at the end of the issue, a scene set in the future shows that Reid is now president of the company. Reid is in love with Lena Toast, who has a TV show with Commander Bob. The latter wears \\"winged boots of doom\\" that do not enable him to fly. He gets around in a flying house, and uses a rope ladder to literally drop in on a randomly selected guest and kidnap him or her to be interviewed on the show. He uses a power blast on uncooperative guests. He is not the only super-powered character on the show. Reid is able to lift his milk truck with his bare hands and has a degree of invulnerability that has prevented serious or lethal injury. Lena, having been divorced 3 times now, is not a good prospect for a guaranteed marriage. Reid's favorite TV program is the soap opera, The Dangers of Ivan. He sometimes skips work to watch it. At one point, Ivan has a terrible accident while driving, spends 6 years in a coma, and, upon awakening, falls to his death from an open window. He returns as an undead monster starring in The Horrors of Ivan. Despite this drastic change, Reid remains a member of his fan club. In Rogue to Riches, which starts right after the 1-shot Eclipse issue, Reid is finally fired by Mr. O'Clock for wrecking one truck too many (which he didn't do), shacks up with Lena, gets employment with a cable company, and, though he appears to be good at it, he and his partner are finally fired for damages to a customer's lawn gnome. He then goes to get his original job back, as it was his calling. There are dream sequences as well, showing Reid's inner anxieties and fears. A Fieldsian revelation wraps up the story. In the 1980s Hollywood bought the rights to the screenplay, which was written by Boswell. A film has yet to be made. = Publication history = Although Reid's adventures were first published in The Georgia Straight newspaper in 1978, the first comic book collecting them was self-published by Boswell in 1980. This 36-page magazine was the only Reid Fleming comic book for six years. The character did appear in a secondary role in the 44-page Heartbreak Comics in 1984. In 1986 Eclipse Comics republished the 1980 issue, and then began publishing a regular series, appearing annually for five issues, and finally the unnumbered Fun with Reid Fleming in 1991. Eclipse went bankrupt not long after, leaving Reid without a publisher for several years. From 1996‚Äì1998, the Canadian publisher Deep Sea Comics reprinted the 1980 issue and the five Eclipse issues as Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman 1-6, followed by three issues (#7-9) of new material. After again lying dormant for four years, Reid Fleming was revived for a Dark Horse Comics one-shot teaming him with Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot. This has been the last new Reid Fleming material to date. 2011 saw the first of two hardcover collected volumes released by IDW Publishing, Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman Volume 1 contains the first Reid Fleming comic and the mini- series Rogue to Riches as well as Heartbreak Comics.  In popular culture  Issue #3 of the 1991 DC Comics limited series Challengers of the Unknown features a poster depicting the character Leslie \\"Rocky\\" Davis starring in a Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman movie. Reid also appears in issue #5 of that same title, threatening to \\"piss on [Rocky's] flowers\\" unless he pays a $17.28 bill. This is an allusion to a well-known scene in the 1980 self- published issue where Reid threatens to urinate on someone's flowers unless 78 cents is paid.

It is famous for being adjacent to the Princess Juliana International Airport and is a popular site for tourists and planewatchers, who visit the beach to watch aircraft on final approach landing at the airport. Location Due to the unique proximity of low-flying airliners arriving and departing from Princess Juliana International Airport, the location is popular with plane spotters. This is one of the few places in the world where aircraft can be viewed in their flight path just outside the end of the runway. Watching airliners pass over the beach is such a popular activity that daily arrivals and departures airline timetables are displayed on a board in most bars and restaurants on the beach. Jetwind sport at Maho beach. Maho Beach is unusually close to the threshold of a runway and is directly under the flight path, resulting in aircraft on their final approach flying over the beach at altitudes of less than above ground level. This makes the beach a popular location for photographers and video makers who intend to capture the aircraft approaching the airport. People on the beach watch an airliner take off. There is a danger of people standing on the beach being blown into solid objects or the water because of the jet blast from aircraft taking off from runway 10. The local government warns that closely approaching and departing aircraft can \\"result in serious injury and/or death\\". An additional fence has been added recently behind runway 10, in order to prevent people from hanging onto the main fence surrounding the runway to experience being blasted by the jet flow. The beach itself is white sand and has little to no vegetation because of jet blast erosion. The Caravanserai Resort, the Sunset Bar and other restaurants/night clubs such as Bamboo Bernies and Bliss are located nearby. The beach is popular with windsurfers and skimboarders because of occasional large waves. History On October 16, 2008, the Maho area of St. Maarten was badly damaged by Hurricane Omar, which destroyed the Sunset Bar and Grill as well as Bamboo Bernies and Bliss. As of November 2009, Sunset Bar and Grill and Bliss have both re-opened. Hurricane Omar reduced the beach to boulders, and damaged the nearby Royal Islander Club La Plage which re-opened February 14, 2009. The same occurred with Hurricane Irma in 2017. On 12 July 2017, as Caribbean Airlines Flight 457 was taking off from the airport, a 57-year-old woman from New Zealand was killed by jet blast. The woman was holding on to a fence at the end of the runway when the wind blew her away, causing her head to smash into concrete. Maho Beach and Princess Juliana International Airport after Hurricane Irma damaged the area in 2017; much of the sand making up the beach was blown towards the airport and through the fence, settling before the threshold of the runway.

The Society of Miniature Painters was founded in May 1896 by Alyn Williams (1865-25 July 1941), and that year it had its inaugural exhibition in the Modern Gallery, 175 New Bond Street, London. It is devoted exclusively to contemporary miniature paintings. King Edward VII granted the society a royal charter on 30 May 1904, and it became the Royal Miniature Society or RMS. To highlight the Society's growing importance the President's Jewel was commissioned in 1920. This is a large, elaborate silver chain of office designed and made by Alfred Lyndhurst Pocock (1881-1962), which is still worn by the current president at formal functions. In 1926 the Society's scope was extended to include sculptors and gravers, and its name was changed by the Royal Command of King George V. The Society's Gold Memorial Bowl Award was established in 1985 and is one of the highest accolades for miniature art in the world. Since its foundation the Society has had eight different Presidents (Alyn Williams was president twice, 1896-1898, 1908-1941), including Sir William Blake Richmond (1842-1921) and Raymond Lister (1919-2001). The RMS's annual exhibition of around 650 works is held each October at the Mall Galleries in London. When the Society was founded the maximum size for a miniature was 12 by 10 inches. Today the permitted size, including the frame, is 6 by 4.5 inches (15 x 11.5 cm). Elizabeth R Meek, MBE (born 1953), who held the post of president between 2004-2013 and is now the Society's Honorary President, describes working in miniature as the most demanding of all painting genre. She names some of the qualities required as: \\"Concentration, stillness of mind and body and a dogged perseverance for perfection - the perfect miniature needs to be devoid of errors.\\" The Society's 122st Annual Exhibition was held between 28 November and 9 December 2018 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London, SW1. There were around 600 works on view, and while the traditional subject matter of portraiture continued unabated, there was a very broad range of subject matter, including landscapes, still lifes and wildlife.

SCSI communication takes place between an initiator and a target. The initiator sends a command to the target which then responds. At the end of the command the target returns a Status Code byte which is usually 00h for success, 02h for a Check Condition (error), or 08h for busy. When the target returns a Check Condition in response to a command, the initiator usually then issues a SCSI Request Sense command in order to obtain more information. During the time between the reporting of a Check Condition and the issuing of the Request Sense command, the target is in the special state called the contingent allegiance condition. Details While a target is in a contingent allegiance condition it must retain the sense information that relates to the error that caused it to enter that condition. This can be a complex issue in configurations which contain more than one initiator. A well-designed target may be able to maintain sense data for one initiator while servicing commands from another initiator. If a check condition then needs to be reported to a second or third initiator then this may become prohibitively difficult. The SCSI definition of the contingent allegiance condition allows the target to use the busy response to incoming commands and to suspend servicing of any recent commands that are still in its execution queue. The events that can cause a target to enter the contingent allegiance condition are :*Target responds to a SCSI command with a check condition 02h :*Target responds to a SCSI command with command terminated 22h :*An unexpected disconnect The events that can cause a target to exit the contingent allegiance condition are :*Target receives a hard reset :*Target receives an abort message :*Target receives a bus device reset message :*Target receives any command from the relevant initiator Extended contingent allegiance condition When the target needs to perform a long error-recovery procedure (typically one that lasts more than one second) it can enter the extended contingent allegiance condition. This may be necessary in high performance systems or in cases where there is a danger that initiator may reset the target after a short timeout interval, thereby aborting the error-recovery procedure. As in the contingent allegiance condition, the target is allowed to use the busy response to incoming commands and to suspend servicing of any recent commands that are still in its execution queue. When a target enters the extended contingent allegiance condition it will send an Initiate Recovery message to the initiator. The SCSI events that can cause a target to exit the extended contingent allegiance condition are :*Target receives a Bus Device Reset :*Target receives a hard reset :*Target receives a Release Recovery message from the relevant initiator  References  Contingent Allegiance Condition ","title":"SCSI contingent allegiance condition"},{"id":"3501299","text":"Mary Eirene Frances Bellerby (n√©e Parker) (29 August 1899 ‚Äì 1975) was an English poet, novelist and short story writer. \\"Her poetry is imbued with a spiritual awareness encoded through the natural environment while her political socialism is more evident in her prose\\". Life Mary Eirene Frances Parker was born in 1899, the daughter of an Anglo-Catholic curate in a poor working-class parish of East Bristol. In 1915 she lost her only brother, killed in action in the First World War. She was educated at Mortimer House School, Clifton and in her twenties worked as a kennel-maid, taught English, Latin and games, tutored, and had a staff job in the London office of the Bristol Times and Mirror. In 1929 she married John Rotherford Bellerby, a Cambridge socialist economist. Her 1931 pamphlet Neighbours and the 1932 novel Shadowy Bricks refer to the social and educational experiments carried out by the couple. After a fall on Lulworth cliffs in 1930 and recurrent ill-health Frances Bellerby remained a semi-invalid until her death in 1975. She separated permanently from her husband in 1942, and became a serious poet. She settled in Cornwall and later in Devon, producing poetry, short stories, and another novel.

Personal life Antoinette Frissell was born in 1907 to Lewis Fox Frissell and Antoinette Wood Montgomery. Her brothers were Phelps Montgomery Frissell and filmmaker Varick Frissell, who was killed in Newfoundland during the filming of The Viking in 1931. Frissell was the granddaughter of Algernon Sydney Frissell, founder and president of the Fifth Avenue Bank of New York, and great-granddaughter of Mary Whitney Phelps and Governor of Missouri John S. Phelps. Ancestors include Elisha Phelps, US representative from Connecticut (1819‚Äì21, 1825‚Äì29), and Maj. Gen. Noah Phelps, Revolutionary War hero. When Frissell was younger, she was passionate about theater, but after two roles in Max Reinhardt productions, she realized it was not for her. In her early 20s, she started taking pictures in part because of her brother, Varick Frissell, a filmmaker and photographer who taught her the basics of photography. She was married to Francis ‚ÄúMac‚Äù Bacon on September 9, 1932, after a few months of the couple‚Äôs romance. She had a passion for skiing, and once went on a three-month long skiing trip with her husband and daughter after her daughter‚Äôs graduation. Toni and her husband purchased a large, white house on Long Island at Saint James called 'Sherrewogue' on the water of Stony Brook Harbor where the couple and their family lived for nearly 50 years. In the early 1970s, she began to have trouble with her memory. To counteract this, she began to write a memoir, one that turned into almost a thousand-page manuscript. Her memoir recounts the times from her childhood to her later life, detailing her privileged upbringing, exploration of Europe, parties in her 20s, youth romances, and adoration for the richer way of life. This early fascination with the privileged life influenced the choice in subjects of her photographs, and the more privileged sports, such as skiing and golf, that she went on to photograph for Sports Illustrated.Frissell, Toni (1994). \\"Toni Frissell Photographs 1933-1967\\". Publisher: Doubleday Pre-war career 1937 photograph of Frida Kahlo for Vogue Frissell was born in 1907 in Manhattan, NY, and took photos under the name Toni Frissell, despite her marriage to Manhattan socialite McNeil Bacon. At the beginning of her career, she worked briefly for Vogue, making captions and writing a bit for the magazine. She was fired because of her poor spelling, but was encouraged by Vogue‚Äôs fashion editor Carmel Snow to take up photography. She took up photography to cope with the illness of her mother, the death of her brother Varick Frissell, and the end of her engagement to Count Serge Orloff-Davidoff. Her first published picture was in Town and Country. After this, she advocated for herself and got a contract with Vogue. She apprenticed with Cecil Beaton.\\"Photographer 'Plucked from Oblivion'\\", nytimes.com, August 28, 1994. She worked with many other famous photographers of the day. Her first photography job, as a fashion photographer for Vogue in 1931, was due to Cond√© Montrose Nast. She later took photographs for Harper's Bazaar. Her fashion photos, even of evening gowns and such, were often notable for their outdoor settings, emphasizing active women. She was one of the first photographers to move outside of the studio for fashion photography, setting a trend in the field. She did not shoot indoors primarily because ‚ÄúI don't know how to photograph in a studio. I never did know about technical points and still don't‚Äù. Her style continued in this ‚Äòplein air‚Äô way throughout her career. For this kind of innovation and experimentation she was well known. World War II Tuskegee airman Edward M.

In 1941, Frissell volunteered her photographic services to the American Red Cross. Later she worked for the Eighth Army Air Force and became the official photographer of the Women's Army Corps. On their behalf, she took thousands of images of nurses, front-line soldiers, WACs, African-American airmen, and orphaned children.\\"Women Come to The Front\\", Library of Congress website; accessed November 11, 2016. She traveled to the European front twice. Her first picture to be published in Life magazine was of bombed out London in 1942. Her moving photographs of military women and African American fighter pilots in the elite 332d Fighter Group (the \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\") were used to encourage public support for women and African Americans in the military. During the War she produced a series of photographs of children that were used in an edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's much-published A child's garden of verses which were an early example of the successful use of photography in illustration of children's literature. After the war In the 1950s, she took informal portraits of the famous and powerful in the United States and Europe, including Winston Churchill, Eleanor Roosevelt, the Vanderbilts, architect Stanford White and John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy, and worked for Sports Illustrated and Life magazines. Throughout her photographic career, she worked at home and abroad for these large publications. When she grew tired of fashion photography and fluctuating between contracts with Vogue and Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, she continued her interest in active women and sports and was hired as the first woman on the staff of Sports Illustrated in 1953, and continued to be one of very few female sport photographers for several decades. In later work she concentrated on photographing women from all walks of life, often as a commentary on the human condition. Her iconic 1944 photograph previously used for book illustration, My Shadow, of a boy with outstretched arms admiring his long shadow on the sea sand, was selected by Edward Steichen for the world-touring exhibition The Family of Man at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, that was seen by 9 million visitors. In 1957 the photograph was used for the cover of a popular psychology text. In 1963 an entire feature in Life magazine was devoted to photographs of 'The Loving Embrace' from across her career.LIFE, 6 Dec 1963, Vol. 55, No. 23, ISSN 0024-3019, Time Inc.

He is known for his comic book series Cud, and his syndicated strip Edge City, created with his wife, Patty LaBan, a couples and family therapist. LaBan is known for his sympathetic and believable characters, real-life dialogue, tight cartoon style and straightforward storytelling.  Political cartoons  LaBan began his career in 1986, freelancing political cartoons for the Ann Arbor News. He's been staff illustrator and political cartoonist for the progressive political magazine In These Times since 1990.  Unsupervised Existence and Cud  The cover from Terry LaBan's International Bob, published by Fantagraphics Books. LaBan's first foray into comics was his series Unsupervised Existence, published by Fantagraphics beginning in 1989. Loosely based on LaBan's own life at the time,LaBan, Terry. \\"Unsupervised Existence,\\" Labanarama. Retrieved July 28, 2008. Unsupervised Existence was a semi-humorous comic book soap opera which followed the adventures of Suzy and Danny, a young, bohemian couple living in Cleveland. Suzy, an underemployed intellectual, spends a lot of time hanging around with her friends and trying to figure out what to do with her life. Danny, her boyfriend, supports them both by driving a cab, but his true vocation is poetry, which he self-publishes, along with the work of his fellow cabbies. Unsupervised Existence garnered LaBan Harvey Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best New Series in 1990. The series was collected in its entirety in two paperbacks, Love's Not a Three-Dollar Fare (the main Suzy and Danny story) and International Bob. International Bob focused on the series' most outrageous character, rock musician/performance artist Bob Binkum. In the book, hulking, morose Bob comes into his own after he leaves the United States in the wake of breaking up with his flighty girlfriend Annadette, who decided she was more into women than men. Fleeing the soap opera, Bob treks from Greece to India in search of exotic escape. LaBan vividly evoked the nothing-to-lose, anything-can-happen world of the unfettered, impecunious vagabond as Bob tries everything from selling junk jewelry on the street to getting ripped off after a romantic encounter. Unsupervised Existence was followed by another series, Cud (also published by Fantagraphics), in 1992. Patterned after books like Dan Clowes' Eightball and R. Crumb's Zap,LaBan, Terry. \\"Cud,\\" Labanarama. Retrieved July 28, 2008. Cud featured a continuing story called \\"You Can't Spank the Monkey If It's on Your Back\\", which followed the rise and fall of a performance artist named Bob Cudd. Cudd was lifted from Unsupervised Existence, but he was a different character in the new series. The rest of each issue featured random stories, several of which went on to appear in other places at other times. \\"Muktuk Wolfsbreath, Hard-Boiled Shaman\\", for instance, became a DC Comics miniseries. Cud lasted eight issues. In 1995, LaBan moved over to Dark Horse Comics, where his third series Cud Comics ran another eight issues, until 1998. Though Cud Comics had almost the same name as the Fantagraphics series, it was otherwise very different. LaBan described it as \\"an attempt to create a sort of Generation X Freak Brothers\\". Every issue featured several stories about Eno and Plum, a \\"slacker\\" couple living in the city. Eno was a lazy Generation X stereotype interested chiefly in watching cable television, while his girlfriend Plum was more of an active go-getter. Other major characters included Plum's dad, Seymour Riverpeace, a wealthy aging, pot-smoking hippy; Catherine, Plum's unhappily single girlfriend; and Edgar Reamington, a yuppie who was always trying to steal away Plum. Most of the stories in the first four issues were collected in a 1997 paperback. He cites both Archie Comics and Gilbert Shelton as influences.  Edge City  The cover from the Edge City collection, by Terry and Patty LaBan. Published by Andrews McMeel. In 2001, King Features Syndicate syndicated Edge City, a daily comic strip drawn by LaBan and co-written with his wife, Patty LaBan. Edge City (e.g., a community outside the boundaries of what people traditionally think of as the city and its suburb) looks at modern family life through the eyes of the fictional Ardin family. In the strip, Len and Abby Ardin are a Jewish-American couple dwelling in the far reaches of suburbia, in a life very different from the one they lived growing up. Between managing their careers and taking care of their kids, Len and Abby barely have time to wave to each other as they hurry off to yet another meeting, carpool or errand. And while their neighborhood is incredibly diverse, it seems like everyone, no matter where they're originally from, lives pretty much the same way. Edge City continues to run in papers throughout the country, and a paperback collection was published in 2007.  Other work  LaBan's comics, cartoons, and humorous illustrations have appeared in a vast number of magazines and anthologies over the years, including Blab, Mad, Nickelodeon Magazine and Details. He works as a freelance illustrator and writer for various comic book companies, most notably DC Comics and the European behemoth Egmont, which publishes books featuring Disney characters. He wrote the Grendel Tales miniseries \\"The Devil May Care,\\" and a number of miniseries for Vertigo, including the opening story arc of The Dreaming. Of late, Laban has been running an original, full length graphic novel about Muktuk Wolfsbreath, a Hard-Boiled Siberian Shaman living in an unspecified past.

Fictional location In the series, Collinsport is a small, coastal fishing village located in Hancock County in the U.S. state of Maine, on the coast about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Bangor. Characters on the show sometimes visit or refer to Bangor or Portland, Maine. The village is, according to the TV documentation, north of Frenchman Bay and near Bucksport, Maine. Bucksport's history and reputation for witchcraft tourism appears to have most directly inspired the fictional Collinsport. The train makes regular runs from Boston, and brought Victoria Winters to Collinsport, one stormy night. The local newspaper, The Collinsport Star is published daily. Population has never been confirmed but is enough to support a cannery and keep the Collins family living in high style. Others speculate that it is Stonnington/ Deer Isle, Bar Harbor, or Winter Harbor. Fictional history Isaac Collins crossed the ocean in a small sailing ship in 1690 and landed in Frenchman Bay. He eventually found a small harbor nearby and started building what would become the town of Collinsport. The town prospered throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, but suffered greatly during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Only the influx of summer visitors and artists during the 1950s and 1960s kept the town from going under completely. Recently the local fishing fleet has been hurt badly by the over-fishing of the Grand Banks. Fixtures =The Collinsport Inn= The Collinsport Inn is a three-story inn located on the main street in downtown Collinsport. It is well liked and used by both tourists and locals alike. There is also a small caf√© downstairs off the lobby. It is probably based on the Jed Prouty Tavern and Inn in Bucksport, Maine, but exterior footage was filmed at the Griswold Inn in Essex, Connecticut. =The Blue Whale= The Blue Whale is a tavern in Collinsport. It was a very popular hang-out for most of the town's denizens. It also has a reputation for some of the very best seafood in the area, and is located right on the water. It is based on the Black Pearl Restaurant in downtown Newport, Rhode Island. =Braithwaite & Sons= Braithwaite & Sons are the local jewelers and silversmiths. They have been in business for well over 100 years, and have filled many custom orders for the Collins family during that time. One of the more notable family members was Ezra Braithwaite. Ezra began working in the family business as a young man sometime shortly before 1897. Ezra actually died in the Collinwood drawing room in 1969 on a business visit. =Brewster's= Brewster's is a local department store. Another long-standing name in the community, the Brewster surname has been mentioned as long ago as the 1840s, no doubt an ancestor of the current family. =Collins General Store= Nestled in the heart of the village, the cool, high-ceilinged store is recessed from the street with an office on one end, and adjoining warehouses. The Collins General Store is known for its wide variety of wares ‚Äî notably its bulk supply of pickles and cheeses. =Collinsport Hospital= While not as large as a major New York City hospital, Collinsport can certainly hold its own as far as patient care and medical technology with the generous donations of the Collins family and, progressive doctors, such as David Woodard and Eric Lang (or Cyrus Longworth in Parallel Time). =Cranshaw House= This was a large, Gothic estate built upon the beach near Widow's Hill. It is located a very short distance away from the equally impressive Collinwood estate and a small footpath existed connecting the two properties together. A mariner named Captain Cranshaw built the house some time in the 1800s. (Note: This relates to continuity established by the Marilyn Ross novels.) =The Eagle (1795)= A tavern in the village of Collinsport in the late 18th century. =The Eagle (1970 P/T)= The Eagle is a tavern in Collinsport, but in parallel time, which runs concurrent to our own. In our time line it is known as The Blue Whale (see above). This alternate reality Blue Whale appears exactly as our own, only the name has changed. =Eagle Hill Cemetery= Eagle Hill Cemetery is one of the larger graveyards to be found in the town. For the past two centuries, the esteemed Collins family had virtually all of their loved ones laid to rest at Eagle Hill. The cemetery‚Äôs most infamous landmark was the Collins family mausoleum. It is here that the vampire Barnabas Collins was entombed in a secret room at the rear of the mausoleum. The room is accessible by pulling the ring in the lion's mouth over the center grave plaque, which opens the panel to enter the room. This room was originally used to covertly store weapons and ammunition during the Revolutionary War. Sleepy Hollow Cemetery just outside Tarrytown, New York was used in the movies. =The Beach Road= The Beach Road is a small highway that passes through the village. It is thought to be the local part of U.S. 1, or Maine state highway 33. =Lookout Point= A beach located between Collinwood and the Collinsport Cannery. A little too rocky for sunbathing, it is usually used for a relaxing stroll along the water's edge, or a short-cut on foot to the cannery. In 1966, tragedy struck when the body of Bill Malloy, the well-liked manager of the Collins' fishing fleet, was found in the water, up the coast a short distance from here. The sheriff later determined that he had been killed at Lookout Point. =Loomis House = The Loomis House is what the Old House (see below) is called in the alternate reality world of Parallel Time (P/T). In P/T, writer William H. Loomis is married to Carolyn Stoddard. They were given the Old House on the Collins estate, and the residence has since become known as \\"Loomis House\\". =Rose Cottage= Rose Cottage was a house near the Collinwood estate. It was the home of Flora Collins, Desmond Collins, Gerard Stiles, and Leticia Faye in 1840. =Saint Eustace Island= Saint Eustace Island is a small, fog-enshrouded island located off of the North cove near Widows' Hill. Upon the island was an ancient castle, which contained the ruins of an abandoned chapel. The land surrounding the castle is difficult to traverse and consists of dense thickets, slippery embankments and heavy marshlands. (Note: This factoid only relates to the House of Dark Shadows movie version locale.) This is the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion in South Norwalk, Connecticut. =The Todds' Antique Shop= It was the dream of Philip and Megan Todd to one day open their own antique shop. In December 1969 they did just that and opened their business here in Collinsport. Carolyn Stoddard discovered the store and took an interest in it early on and voluntarily worked part-time at the shop for a while. Finding and buying their treasures from area estates and auctions was a short-lived endeavor for the Todds however. The antique shop burned to the ground in mid-February 1970, one in a string of \\"unfortunate events\\" that also took the lives of Philip and Megan shortly thereafter. =Weatherby Farm= A property bordering the Collinwood estate to the south, owned by Mordecai Grimes in the early 19th century (circa 1840). The Collins' had been trying to acquire this property for quite some time, but Mordecai always declined to sell. He didn't want to give up the land his father had left to him. One day his cattle broke through the fences between the farm and the Collins property. A week later, all his cattle were dead. Mordecai accused Quentin Collins of killing them with witchcraft. =Widow's Hill= Widows' Hill is a high elevation point outside of the village and the location of the Collinwood estate. It was one 100 feet (30 m) from the edge of the cliff to the water below, and on a cloudless day, one could see 20 miles (32 km) out to sea from the cliff along the water. Widows' Hill acquired its name because women used to wait on the cliff and look out to sea, watching for their ill-fated husbands' ships to return. When Jeremiah Collins decided to build Collinwood on the hill in the 1796, he turned the widows away and told them to go home and keep their grief to themselves. Some people in Collinsport claimed that the widows still walked the hill 150 years later as ghosts. The wailing sounds coming from the hill were believed to be the sobbing widows, rather than the wind, and some old-timers in town claimed to have seen them walking the hill from a distance. By 1967, three people had thrown themselves off the cliff. Josette Collins jumped to her death because she was being pursued by her \\"lover\\" and would rather die than welcome his attentions, and the two others were Collinwood governesses. Legend told of a third governess who would one day be found dead at the bottom of the cliff. Some have speculated that this is Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park, just outside Bar Harbor, Maine. Others believe this is nearby Thunder Hole. =Windcliff Sanitarium= Although not located in Collinsport, the Windcliff Sanitarium should be mentioned here due to its ties to the community. Windcliff is actually located about 100 miles (160 km) away. Dr. Julia Hoffman, a psychiatrist and blood specialist, is Chief of Staff. Several of the Collins' family and friends have spent some time here after experiencing various \\"traumatic events\\". =Collinwood Mansion= Collinwood Mansion is a gloomy forty-room mansion located near Widows' Hill. The house was built in 1795 by Joshua Collins. The east wing of Collinwood was closed off around 1916 and most of the house fell into disuse. Elizabeth Collins Stoddard successfully petitioned to have the property tax reduced due to most of the house being closed. The house was more of a liability than an asset and by 1967 it was only Collins-owned property without a mortgage. The road leading up to Collinwood from town is steep, with many turns. Several people have died going down the hill in bad weather. Collinwood is reputed to be haunted by Josette Collins as well as several other members of the ancient Collins Family. Several actual mansions were used for Collinwood. The Carey Mansion (Seaview Terrace) in Newport, Rhode Island, now part of the Salve Regina University campus, was used for the original series. The Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown, New York was for both films. In the 1991 NBC version, Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills was utilized, with nearby Griffith Park as the forest surrounding Collinwood. =The Old House= The Old House was once the provincial mansion of the Collins family up until 1796. Located on the Collins estate near Widows' Hill, it was formerly known as Collinwood. Joshua Collins was the patriarch of the last generation of Collins family members to be raised there. In 1796, construction was completed on a larger family home on the same property and this first known as the Great House. Later, it would come to be known as Collinwood. When it was first built, the original family mansion began to be referred to as the Old House. With the passing of generations, this off-hand phrase became the official nomenclature for the regal estate. The filming location was the former Spratt Mansion on the Lyndhurst estate, destroyed by fire in 1969. Originally built in the 1850s, it was acquired by Russell Hopkins in 1907. Called \\"Veruselle\\", it was better known as The Colonnades.

It first aired on 18 November 1963, during the first season. Introduction A surgeon with a steel plate in his head as a result of a war injury suddenly finds himself hearing strange voices discussing global conquest. Opening narration Plot Intelligent, parasitic extraterrestrials that resemble Terran rocks, with the intention of enslaving the human race, find a hideout in geologist Dr. Jonas Temple's lab. Although undetected by ordinary humans, physician Dr. Paul Cameron (with a surgically implanted metal plate in his skull) is able to \\"hear\\" the alien \\"rocks\\" communicate with each other. Aware that he can hear them, while referring to Paul as \\"the listener\\", they realize he's a threat, and they compel him to kill himself by jumping from the lab window to prevent him from revealing their intentions. At the last minute, he is saved when his wife, Laurie, Dr. Temple's assistant, returns to the lab, breaking the alien's mind control. Thinking he's going insane, Paul takes an impulsive vacation to Mexico with Laurie to help clear his troubled mind. Dr. Temple, now controlled by one of the \\"rocks\\" after it entered his body, pursues them. In Mexico, Laurie becomes possessed after Dr. Temple finds her alone in the remote desert cabin that she and Paul had rented, and is commanded by the aliens to possess her husband upon his return. Fighting for his life, Paul is forced to stab Temple, and shoot Laurie (though it is not clear that she dies), forcing the aliens to evacuate the bodies they inhabited, thus showing their true form - hideous, shiny-black, crab-like beings with two glowing eyes. He then starts a fire inside the cabin, where the aliens are presumably destroyed, while carrying Laurie's seemingly lifeless body away from the blaze. Closing narration Background Adapted from Louis Charbonneau's novel Corpus Earthling, first published by Zenith Books in 1960. In the novel, Paul is an unmarried university instructor with amorous desires for Laurie, one of his students. He is a latent telepath who has been compelled, on at least three occasions, toward suicide by an alien force that calls him \\"the listener\\". The invaders were brought to Earth with the first geological samples from Mars (the story is set post 1990). Dr Temple, who diagnoses Paul as schizophrenic after he reveals he hears voices, is the first to be possessed when he touches the alien rocks with his tongue. At the end, after killing the aliens, he finds a telepathic girlfriend.Schow, David J. & Jeffrey Frentzen The Outer Limits: The Official Companion, New York: Ace Books, 1986, p.157 This was the second of three episodes to star Robert Culp (the other two were \\"The Architects of Fear\\" written by Meyer Dolinski and \\"Demon with a Glass Hand\\" by Harlan Ellison).

The legend of the monster is considered a draw for tourism in the Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York areas. Map of Lake Champlain watershed  History of the legend  Over the years, there have been over 300 reported sightings of Champ. French cartographer Samuel de Champlain, the founder of Qu√©bec and the lake's namesake, is often claimed to be the first European to have sighted Champ, in 1609. However, this legend dates back to a fake quote published in the Summer 1970 issue of Vermont Life. In the Vermont Life article, Champlain is alleged to have documented a \\"20-foot serpent thick as a barrel, and a head like a horse.\\" This quote has often been repeated, but is in fact apocryphal. Champlain did document large fish: The 1878 translation of his journals clarifies that Chaoufaou refers to gar (or gar pike), specifically Lepisosteus osseus (the longnose gar). An 1819 report in the Plattsburgh Republican, entitled \\"Cape Ann Serpent on Lake Champlain\\", reports a \\"Capt. Crum\\" sighting an enormous serpentine monster. Crum estimated the monster to have been about 187-feet long and approximately two hundred yards away from him. Despite the great distance, he claimed to have witnessed it being followed by \\"two large Sturgeon and a Bill-fish\\" and was able to see that it had three teeth and eyes the color of peeled onions. He also described the monster as having \\"a belt of red\\" around its neck and a white star on its forehead. In 1883, Sheriff Nathan H. Mooney claimed that he had seen a water serpent about \\"20 rods\\" (the equivalent of 110 yards in length) from where he was on the shore. He claimed that he was so close that he could see \\"round white spots inside its mouth\\" and that \\"the creature appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in length\\". Mooney's sighting led to many more alleged eyewitnesses coming forward with their own accounts of Champ. The legend of Champ captured the interest of P. T. Barnum, and in 1873 and 1887, the famous showman offered rewards for anyone who could bring him the monster. Sandra Mansi with investigators Joe Nickell and Benjamin Radford  Mansi photograph  In 1977, Sandra Mansi took a photograph while on vacation with her family that appears to show something sticking out of the lake. The entire bay of the lake where the photograph reportedly was taken is no deeper than . According to Joe Nickell, it is unlikely that a giant creature could swim, let alone hide, in such shallow water. It has been suggested that the object in the photograph could possibly be a rising tree trunk or log. Champ floating tree stump model  Recent reports  Champ reportedly can be seen in a video taken by fishermen Dick Affolter and his stepson Pete Bodette in the summer of 2005. Close examination of the images may be interpreted either as a head and neck of a plesiosaur- like animal and even an open mouth in one frame and a closed mouth in another; or as a fish or eel. Although two retired FBI forensic image analysts, who reviewed the tape, said it appears authentic and unmanipulated, one of them added that \\"there's no place in there that I can actually see an animal or any other object on the surface\\". One piece of evidence, though not a \\"sighting\\" per se, is the recording of sounds from within the lake by the Fauna Communications Research Institute in 2003, working as part of a Discovery Channel program. The group described the sounds as being similar to those produced by Beluga whales or dolphins‚Äîneither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain. An article describing the recordings has been published to scientific literature. Based upon appearance and \\"mysterious alligatorlike tracks\\" found near Lake Champlain, cryptozoologists Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall suggested in 2016 that \\"Champ\\" could be a member of the family Crocodylidae (crocodiles). Researcher Scott Mardis explains that the tracks were likely the tracks of a large snapping turtle and also mentions the Longnose Gar or the Lake Sturgeon as more probable candidates for \\"Champ.\\"  Cultural importance to New York and Vermont  Vermont Lake Monsters mascot The Champ legend has become a revenue-generating attraction. For example, the village of Port Henry, New York, has erected a giant model of Champ and holds \\"Champ Day\\" on the first Saturday of every August. As the mascot of Vermont's lone Minor League Baseball affiliate, the Vermont Lake Monsters, Champ became more prominent after the team was renamed from the Vermont Expos to the Vermont Lake Monsters following the 2005 season. Champ has been the primary attraction of the New York‚ÄìPenn League affiliate since their inception. Several nearby establishments, including a car wash, use images of Champ as a logo.

Biography Lay was born in Buffalo, New York. He was appointed 2nd assistant engineer in the Union Navy on July 8, 1862, and was promoted to 1st assistant engineer on October 15, 1863. He designed the spar torpedo which was used by Lieutenant William B. Cushing to destroy the Confederate ironclad ram at Plymouth, North Carolina, on October 27, 1864. After the fall of Richmond in 1865, Lay was sent in advance of Admiral David D. Porter's fleet to remove obstructions from the James River. Lay resigned from the navy on May 22, 1865, and was then was employed by the Peruvians to fortify the harbor of Callao with fixed mines and suspended torpedoes, in order to prevent the Spanish fleet from entering. Lay returned to the United States in 1867, where he began work on the design and building of a locomotive (self-propelled) torpedo. The Lay torpedo Lay's first design, the Lay Torpedo or Lay Dirigible (1872) was a surface running cylindrical vessel with conical ends, powered by a reciprocating engine fuelled by compressed carbon dioxide gas. Two cables were paid out from the torpedo to the controlling ship or shore station which allowed the operator to steer it by means of electrical signals. In 1880, he produced an improved version ‚Äî the Lay-Haight Torpedo. This used a 3-cylinder Brotherhood engine fuelled by carbon dioxide. The Lay torpedo was one of several designs tested at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. Lay torpedoes were also acquired by Peru for use in the War of the Pacific, but proved unsuccessful. On 28 August 1879 at Antofagasta the ironclad Hu√°scar, while engaging shore batteries and the ships , Magellan and Limar√≠, launched a Lay torpedo only to have it reverse course. The ship was saved when an officer jumped overboard to divert it. Lay's inventions made him a rich man, but he lost it all in speculation, and he spent his final years in poverty. He died at Bellevue Hospital, New York City, in April 1899.

A GAP policy covers the difference between the value of a car (i.e., what the insurance company will typically pay) and what the borrower owes on the loan if the car is totaled or stolen. Because most cars lose value as soon as they're driven off the dealer's lot, and most car loans cover more than the purchase price of the vehicle, the \\"gap\\" between the two can be thousands of dollars. Legally, GAP insurance is not the same as GAP waiver. A GAP insurance policy is typically regarded by state regulators as an insurance product, and regulated as such. By contrast, GAP waiver is not considered insurance in most U.S. states, provided that the auto lender agrees to waive the difference between the outstanding loan amount and the value of the vehicle at the time it was totaled or stolen.

Created by John Gorman and Gary Gillies, the attraction had a short run as a mobile event at various exhibition centres in the UK (including the Bournemouth International Centre and the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre). On 15 October 1993 it opened in the basement of the Trocadero centre in London. The permanent attraction in London closed after a flood in August 1996 and was never reopened. It made a short return between December 1999 and January 2000 in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow in a modified form.  Technology  The marines originally carried blank firing pistols. For Alien War London, an innovative electronic system called Soundfire was developed to allow the weapons to sound like those used in the film Aliens. The system consisted of M41A pulse rifles with infrared transmitters and small strobe lights (to simulate muzzle flash). When the trigger is pulled a signal is transmitted to receivers hidden in the set. A central computer then plays gunfire sound effects to speakers in the correct area of the set. The method of producing the effect was entirely different from how it would be imagined the weapons would discharge. The strobe lights also resembled blue camera flashes, and did not resemble a muzzleflash. The system also played other sound effects such as the Alien sounds and suffered teething troubles in the first months after opening meaning that the blank firing pistols had to be used for most early shows. The show was seen in various guises and briefly featured an actor dressed as the Predator for a spell prior to it closing in Glasgow.

He was employed by Mack Sennett and worked with many leading players such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Mabel Normand. In the talkies, he played the scruffy comedy relief character \\"Fuzzy Q. Jones\\" who appeared in dozens of films, including the Producers Releasing Corporation's \\"Billy the Kid\\" series from 1940 to 1946, and their \\"Lone Rider\\" series from 1941 to 1943. Biography Born in Santa Ana, California to Walter St. John and Nora Arbuckle, he entered silent films around 1912 and soon rose to co-starring and starring roles in short comic films from a variety of studios. His uncle on his mother's side, Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, may have helped him in his early days at Mack Sennett Studios, but talent kept him working. He was also an acrobat. St. John frequently appeared as Arbuckle's mischievously villainous rival for the attentions of leading ladies such as Mabel Normand and Minta Durfee. He worked with Arbuckle and Charles Chaplin in The Rounders (1914), although his most critically praised film during this period with Arbuckle remains Fatty and Mabel Adrift (1916). In France, he was billed as \\"Picratt.\\" Love (1919) St. John (right) with Buster Keaton and Roscoe Arbuckle in Out West (1918) When Arbuckle formed his own production company, he brought St. John with him and recruited stage star Buster Keaton into his films, creating a formidable roughhouse trio. After Arbuckle was involved in a widely publicized scandal that prevented him from appearing in movies, he pseudonymously directed his nephew Al as a comic leading man in silent and sound films such as The Iron Mule (1925) and Bridge Wives (1932). Dozens of St. John's early films were screened during the 56-film Arbuckle retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2006. During the sound era St. John was mainly seen as an increasingly scruffy and bearded comic character. He played this rube role in Buster Keaton's 1937 comedy Love Nest on Wheels. That same year he began supporting cowboy stars Fred Scott and later Jack Randall, but most of his films were made for Poverty Row studio Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). For that studio, he played \\"Fuzzy Q. Jones\\" in the Billy the Kid series starring Bob Steele, the Lone Rider series (starring George Houston and later Bob Livingston), and the Billy the Kid/Billy Carson series starring Buster Crabbe. The name \\"Fuzzy\\" originally belonged to a different actor, John Forrest ‚ÄúFuzzy‚Äú Knight, who took on the role of \\"cowboy sidekick\\" before St. John. The studio first intended to hire Knight for the western series, but then gave the role to St. John instead, who took on the nickname of his rival for his screen character. Buster Crabbe and St. John in Shadows of Death (1945) Exhibitors loved Fuzzy, who could be counted on to attract moviegoers. Fuzzy's character was the main box-office draw in these films when shown in England and Europe. These ultra-low-budget Westerns took only a bit more than a week to film, so that Crabbe and St. John made 36 films together in a surprisingly short time. When Crabbe left PRC (according to interviews, in disgust at their increasingly low budgets), St. John was paired with new star Lash LaRue. Ultimately, St. John made more than 80 Westerns as Fuzzy. St. John also created a character, \\"Stoney,\\" in the film The Law of 45's that later appeared, but played by different actors (including John Wayne), in the continuing Western film series The Three Mesquiteers. St. John's last film was released in 1952. From that time on until his death in 1963 in Lyons, Georgia, he made personal appearances at fairs and rodeos, and traveled with the Tommy Scott Wild West Show. Altogether, Al St. John acted in 395 movies, spanning five decades from 1912 to 1952. He was working with a traveling Wild West show in Georgia and was waiting to go on when he suffered a massive heart attack and died at age 70.

Charles Bewley Raised in a famous Dublin Quaker business family, he embraced Irish Republicanism and Roman Catholicism. He was the Irish envoy to Berlin who reportedly thwarted efforts to obtain visas for Jews wanting to leave Nazi Germany in the 1930s and to move to the safety of the Irish Free State. Family and early life He was born into a wealthy privileged family, the eldest of four brothers, in Dublin, Ireland. His mother was Elizabeth Eveleen Pim. Her family owned a large department store in George's Street, Dublin. His father was physician Dr. Henry Theodore Bewley (1860-1945), related to the family that operated the successful \\"Bewley's caf√©s\\" chain of coffee houses in Dublin that is still famous today. His parents were both Quakers; Charles and his brothers were raised as Quakers. He was educated at Park House, a boarding school in England. In 1901 he won a scholarship to Winchester College. He became the Library Prefect. This honour was withdrawn when he declared in a debate that \\"England is not a musical nation\\" and he ridiculed the anthem \\"God save the King\\". He proceeded to New College, Oxford, where he read Law. In 1910 he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry.Charles Bewley Won the Newdigate Prize 1910 for \\"Atlantis\\". 1910‚Äì1913: Winter in Ireland; A Girl's Song on Her Lover, Paidin, Ruadh He completed his training as a barrister at King's Inns, Dublin, and in 1914 he was called to the bar. Charles' brother Kenneth also attended Oxford University. Kenneth was a career civil servant in H.M. Treasury. His younger brothers, Geoffrey and Maurice, studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin. Charles Bewley was seen as an \\"enfant terrible\\". He rejected his Anglo-Irish heritage and embraced Celtic mythology of the kind popularised by W. B. Yeats. He spoke against the 'evils of Anglicization', supported the Boers and converted to Roman Catholicism. He rejected Unionist politics and supported the Home Rule movement. Career At the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 he was in Ireland as a defending barrister for many nationalists and republicans. He wrote Se√°n Mac Eoin's death-sentence speech. In the 1918 general election he stood, unsuccessfully, as a Sinn F√©in candidate. During the Irish civil war, he took the treaty side. As a barrister he prosecuted many anti-Treaty prisoners. Between the truce in the Irish War of Independence and the treaty being signed, he was Irish consul in Berlin with responsibility for trade. He was appointed Irish ambassador to the Vatican (resident minister to the Holy See) in 1929. At that time, Irish diplomatic appointments were meant to be made by the British King. Bewley frequently flouted the diplomatic niceties by ignoring the implications of that. The complaints of H.J. Chilton, the British representative, and of Sir R. Clive, his successor, if anything improved Bewley's reputation in Ireland. In July 1933 the British Foreign Office got annoyed when the Pope knighted Bewley into the Order of the Grand Cross of St Gregory the Great, as the King's agreement had not been sought. They told Bewley, with no effect, that as a King's representative he was not entitled to wear the decoration without royal permission. However, the constant bickering between the Irish and British representatives to the Vatican pleased neither Dublin nor London. It paved the way for Bewley to obtain the appointment he really wanted. He went to Berlin in July 1933. President of Germany, Hindenburg, praised his impeccable German. His reports from Berlin enthusiastically praised National Socialism and Chancellor Hitler. He gave interviews to German papers, which were anti-British. In Berlin he annoyed the British embassy. He ignored the King's jubilee celebrations in 1935. With the ending of the economic war and the return of the treaty ports, there were good relations between Ireland and Britain. Bewley was then frequently reprimanded by Dublin, who were no longer amused at his anti-British jibes . Anti-Semitism The first indication that Bewley was anti-Semitic was in Berlin in 1921. The new Irish state was not yet formally recognised. Bewley was the Irish consul for trade. Michael Collins sent Robert Briscoe to buy guns. At the time, Briscoe was an IRA quartermaster. In time he would play an important political role and would be the first Jewish Lord Mayor of Dublin. Bewley and Briscoe went to a Jewish- owned music hall in the Tauenzien Palast, but, after Briscoe left, it was reported that Bewley insulted Judaism and was thrown out. There was a drunken brawl. John Chartres, the head of the Irish Bureau, was going to take action, but the Irish Civil War broke out. Briscoe took the anti-Treaty side (which lost), while Bewley returned to Dublin, took the pro-treaty side and prosecuted anti-Treaty prisoners in the courts.According to the late Professor Dan Binchy, Se√°n T. O'Kelly held that against him afterwards. In March 1922 George Gavan Duffy wrote to Ernest Blythe opposing Bewley's appointment as an Irish envoy to Germany: \\"...there is a great objection to appointing him to such a post in Germany, because his semitic [sic] convictions are so pronounced that it would be very difficult for him to deal properly with all the persons and questions within the scope of an Envoy to Berlin, where the Jewish element is very strong.\\" Gavan Duffy suggested instead that Munich or Vienna might be more suitable, \\"... as the same considerations would not arise in those places\\".National Archives of Ireland file DFA ES Box 34 File 239; (text on line) It is believed Bewley's hatred towards Jews was partly influenced by what some consider controversial teachings of Irish Catholic priest Denis Fahey. He once referred to Fahey's pamphlet as 'The rulers of Russia' when being interviewed by the Irish Minister for External Affairs Joseph Walshe, while he was serving as an envoy to Berlin.Documents on Irish Foreign Affairs, Report from Charles Bewley to Joseph Walsh, 1938 Envoy to Berlin Bewley was the \\"Irish Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary\\" in Berlin in the crucial years from 1933 to 1939. Reading his reports to Dublin during the 1930s gives the impression that German Jews were not threatened; that they were involved in pornography, abortion and \\"the international white slave traffic\\". This was also the man responsible for processing visa applications from Jews wishing to leave Germany for Ireland. He explained the Nuremberg Laws \\"As the Chancellor pointed out, it amounts to the making of the Jews into a national minority; and as they themselves claim to be a separate race, they should have nothing to complain of.\\" He reports that he had no knowledge of any \\"deliberate cruelty on the part of the [German] Government ... towards the Jews\\". He criticised Irish refugee policy as \\"inordinately liberal, and facilitating the entry of the wrong class of people\\" (meaning Jews). The Irish legation in Berlin consisted of two people, Bewley and a German secretary called Frau Kamberg. This German lady appeared more concerned than Bewley.Escaping the Holocaust to an Irish safe haven Fewer than a hundred Jews obtained Irish visas between 1933 and 1939. Bewley was dismissed from his position in 1939. Later years Bewley was dismissed just as World War II was breaking out, and never received a pension. However, Joseph Goebbels gave him a job writing propaganda. For a time he worked for a Swedish news agency, which was part of Goebbels' propaganda machine. He was next heard of at the end of the War, being held by British troops. He was picked up in Merano, Northern Italy in May 1945 and held in Terni. He was carrying Irish diplomatic papers identifying him as the Irish minister to Berlin and to the Vatican. Joseph Walshe, Secretary of the Department of External Affairs and Sir John Maffey the British diplomatic representative in Ireland, decided on a most appropriate solution, given Bewley's ego. At that time, passports had an entry \\"trade or profession\\". Charles Bewley was issued with a new Irish passport, which had, for that entry \\"a person of no importance\\". At the end of the war, checkpoints were frequent. It was necessary to produce passports. He never produced this passport. He was released in Rome, and apparently never left. He wrote some newspaper articles and a biography of Hermann G√∂ring 1956. In his final years he and Mgr Hugh O'Flaherty, 'the Vatican Pimpernel' who had rescued thousands of Jews and escaped POWs from the Nazis, became great friends.

At its summit the hill is above sea level. The hill is also known as Roman Camp. The summit and surrounding woodlands are now in the care of the National Trust. A track, named Calves Well Lane, running west from Sandy Lane leads to a car park which is maintained by donations made to the National Trust collection box provide on the edge of the car park. Litter bins and benches make Beacon Hill an ideal location for picnics. There are several footpaths to follow across the area. Formation Beacon Hill is a part of the Cromer Ridge which is a ridge of old glacial moraines (terminal moraine) that stands next to the coast above Cromer.BBC Coast The Cromer Ridge seems to have been the front line of the ice sheet for some time at the last glaciations, which is shown by the large size of the feature. All the material that was dredged up from the North Sea was deposited by the glaciers to form Beacon Hill and the rest of the ridge. The Ridge is the highest land of East Anglia and stretches for along the North Norfolk coast. It is characterized by its irregular, undulating, intimate and well- wooded topography and by substantial areas of heather in the west. Small, enclosed arable fields, hedge banks, sunken lanes such as Sandy Lane which leads up Beacon Hill are common characteristic features all along the ridge. Features On the summit of Beacon Hill there is an earthwork enclosure. This area is known as Roman camp, a name which it is believed was coined around the turn of the 19th century by local horse drawn cab drivers as a means to make this place more appealing for tourists using the already existing earthworks to justify this 'assertion'. Despite its name there is no evidence of any Roman occupation on this site. The earthworks, or enclosure, was once a coastal signal station and probably of earlier beacons(s) although the exact location of this beacon(s) is not known. There have been several archeological excavations in this area but none of these have specifically investigated the earthworks at Beacon Hill. There are reports of a watch being kept at this site in 1324, so it's very probable that some kind of Beacon existed around this time. Historians believe there would have been a Beacon here around the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and certainly one in 1608 when there are records of repairs. There are records from the Norfolk Quarter Sessions of money being raised in the 1650s and 1660s to maintain a Beacon here and to ensure a watch was still being kept. This would have been during the time of the Dutch invasions. According to Faden's 1797 map of Norfolk this hill is described as The Old Beacon or Watch Tower which suggests it was no longer in use at this time. Although the exact location of these Beacons on the ridge are not known, this site would appear to be the most likely place for such outposts. Maps from the 18th century have the site marked as a rounded enclosure ‚Äòtermed‚Äô as the old Beacon and watch tower.Bryants Map of 1826 The Ordnance Survey map of 1838 calls the site a Signal Station and calls it Black Beacon Hill.East and West Runton: Two Villages, One Parish by G.F. Leake, Poppyland Publishing, p. 26 . It is understood the banks located here today are the remains of a signal station built during the time of the Napoleonic Wars and was part of a chain of signals stretching from Devon and as far north as Edinburgh.East and West Runton: Two Villages, One Parish by G.F. Leake, Poppyland Publishing, p. 27 . The signal sites from Norfolk downwards were abandoned from November 1841.

Biography He won the gold medal at the 1978 European Championships in Prague. In that race he beat the future world-record holder Sebastian Coe and the future Olympic Champion Steve Ovett both from the UK. Beyer's time of 1:43.84 made him temporarily the fourth-fastest 800m runner of all time.http://digilander.libero.it/Mennea/Stagionali/WRL/1980/800.htm 1980 Year Ranking. Beyer himself explained to the British sports journalist and writer Pat Butcher that he won that surprising championship because for the first and only time in his career, he had been able to train for the previous year free from injuries. He also ran intelligently, not taking the lead until the final tens of metres, but at the same time following Coe and Ovett closely. Ultimately, in Beyer's opinion, he was in a good shape that day and could thus defeat even Ovett, who was known as a sharp kicker (see Pat Butcher, The Perfect Distance: Ovett&Coe;: The Record-Breaking Rivalry, London: Weidenfeld&Nicolson;, 2004). In the 1978 European Athletics Championships, he also participated in 1,500 metres where he placed ninth (see, for example, \\"European Championships Prague\\" / EM-Praha, Tapio Pekola et al., eds., Kaarina, Finland: \\"Runner\\" / Juoksija magazine, 1978). After 1978, he continued his competitive running career until at least 1982, but he never won a major international championship again. In the 1980 Moscow Olympics, he was surprisingly eliminated in the 800-metre semifinals, and he placed seventh in the 1982 European Athletics Championships 800-metre final (see, for example, \\"The Moscow Olympic Book\\" / Moskovan Olympiakirja, Tapio Pekola et al., eds., Helsinki, Finland: \\"Runner\\" / Juoksija magazine, 1980; Markku Siukonen and Matti Ahola, eds., \\"The Great European Championships Book\\" / Suuri EM-kirja, Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland: Sports Publications Ltd. / Sportti-Kustannus Oy, 1990).

Scheifler and James Gettys: X Window System: Core and extension protocols, X version 11, releases 6 and 6.1, Digital Press 1996, RFC 1013Grant Edwards. An Introduction to X11 User Interfaces is the base protocol of the X Window System, which is a networked windowing system for bitmap displays used to build graphical user interfaces on Unix, Unix-like, and other operating systems. The X Window System is based on a client‚Äìserver model: a single server controls the input/output hardware, such as the screen, the keyboard, and the mouse; all application programs act as clients, interacting with the user and with the other clients via the server. This interaction is regulated by the X Window System core protocol. Other protocols related to the X Window System exist, both built at the top of the X Window System core protocol or as separate protocols. In the X Window System core protocol, only four kinds of packets are sent, asynchronously, over the network: requests, replies, events, and errors. Requests are sent by a client to the server to ask it to perform some operation (for example, create a new window) and to send back data it holds. Replies are sent by the server to provide such data. Events are sent by the server to notify clients of user activity or other occurrences they are interested in. Errors are packets sent by the server to notify a client of errors occurred during processing of its requests. Requests may generate replies, events, and errors; other than this, the protocol does not mandate a specific order in which packets are sent over the network. Some extensions to the core protocol exist, each one having its own requests, replies, events, and errors. X originated at MIT in 1984 (its release X11 appeared in September 1987). Its designers Bob Scheifler and Jim Gettys set as an early principle that its core protocol was to \\"create mechanism, not policy\\". As a result, the core protocol does not specify the interaction between clients and between a client and the user. These interactions are the subject of separate specifications,Jim Gettys. Open Source Desktop Technology Road Map such as the ICCCM and the freedesktop.org specifications, and are typically enforced automatically by using a given widget set.  Overview In this example, the X server takes input from a keyboard and mouse and displays to a screen. A web browser and a terminal emulator run on the user's workstation, and a terminal emulator runs on a remote server but under the control of the user's machine. Note that the remote application runs just as it would locally. Communication between server and clients is done by exchanging packets over a channel. The connection is established by the client (how the client is started is not specified in the protocol). The client also sends the first packet, containing the byte order to be used and information about the version of the protocol and the kind of authentication the client expects the server to use. The server answers by sending back a packet stating the acceptance or refusal of the connection, or with a request for a further authentication. If the connection is accepted, the acceptance packet contains data for the client to use in the subsequent interaction with the server. An example interaction between a client and a server. After connection is established, four types of packets are exchanged between client and server over the channel: #Request: The client requests information from the server or requests it to perform an action. #Reply: The server responds to a request. Not all requests generate replies. #Event: The server informs the client of an event, such as keyboard or mouse input, a window being moved, resized or exposed, etc. #Error: The server sends an error packet if a request is invalid. Since requests are queued, error packets generated by a request may not be sent immediately. Request and reply packets have varying length, while event and error packets have a fixed length of 32 bytes. Request packets are numbered sequentially by the server as soon as it receives them: the first request from a client is numbered 1, the second 2, etc. The least significant 16 bits of the sequential number of a request is included in the reply and error packets generated by the request, if any. They are also included in event packets to indicate the sequential number of the request that the server is currently processing or has just finished processing. Windows  What is usually called a window in most graphical user interfaces is called a top-level window in the X Window System. The term window is also used to denote windows that lie within another window, that is, the subwindows of a parent window. Graphical elements such as buttons, menus, icons, etc. can be realized using subwindows. A possible placement of some windows: 1 is the root window, which covers the whole screen; 2 and 3 are top-level windows; 4 and 5 are subwindows of 2. The parts of a window that are outside its parent are not visible. A client can request the creation of a window. More precisely, it can request the creation of a subwindow of an existing window. As a result, the windows created by clients are arranged in a tree (a hierarchy). The root of this tree is the root window, which is a special window created automatically by the server at startup. All other windows are directly or indirectly subwindows of the root window. The top-level windows are the direct subwindows of the root window. Visibly, the root window is as large as the virtual desktop, and lies behind all other windows. The content of a window is not always guaranteed to be preserved over time. In particular, the window content may be destroyed when the window is moved, resized, covered by other windows, and in general made totally or partly non-visible. In particular, content is lost if the X server is not maintaining a backing store of the window content. The client can request backing store for a window to be maintained, but there is no obligation for the server to do so. Therefore, clients cannot assume that backing store is maintained. If a visible part of a window has an unspecified content, an event is sent to notify the client that the window content has to be drawn again. Every window has an associated set of attributes, such as the geometry of the window (size and position), the background image, whether backing store has been requested for it, etc. The protocol includes requests for a client to inspect and change the attributes of a window. Windows can be \`InputOutput\` or \`InputOnly\`. \`InputOutput\` windows can be shown on the screen and are used for drawing. \`InputOnly\` windows are never shown on the screen and are used only to receive input. Anatomy of a FVWM window. The white area is the window as created and seen by the client application. The decorative frame and title bar (possibly including buttons) that is usually seen around windows are created by the window manager, not by the client that creates the window. The window manager also handles input related to these elements, such as resizing the window when the user clicks and drags the window frame. Clients usually operate on the window they created disregarding the changes operated by the window manager. A change it has to take into account is that re-parenting window managers, which almost all modern window managers are, change the parent of top-level windows to a window that is not the root. From the point of view of the core protocol, the window manager is a client, not different from the other applications. Data about a window can be obtained by running the \`xwininfo\` program. Passing it the \`-tree\` command-line argument, this program shows the tree of subwindows of a window, along with their identifiers and geometry data.  Pixmaps and drawables  A pixmap is a region of memory that can be used for drawing. Unlike windows, pixmaps are not automatically shown on the screen. However, the content of a pixmap (or a part of it) can be transferred to a window and vice versa. This allows for techniques such as double buffering. Most of the graphical operations that can be done on windows can also be done on pixmaps. Windows and pixmaps are collectively named drawables, and their content data resides on the server. A client can however request the content of a drawable to be transferred from the server to the client or vice versa.  Graphic contexts and fonts  The client can request a number of graphic operations, such as clearing an area, copying an area into another, drawing points, lines, rectangles, and text. Beside clearing, all operations are possible on all drawables, both windows and pixmaps. Most requests for graphic operations include a graphic context, which is a structure that contains the parameters of the graphic operations. A graphic context includes the foreground color, the background color, the font of text, and other graphic parameters. When requesting a graphic operation, the client includes a graphic context. Not all parameters of the graphic context affect the operation: for example, the font does not affect drawing a line. The core protocol specifies the use of server-side fonts. Such fonts are stored as files, and the server accesses them either directly via the local filesystem or via the network from another program called font server. Clients can request the list of fonts available to the server and can request a font to be loaded (if not already) or unloaded (if not used by other clients) by the server. A client can request general information about a font (for example, the font ascent) and the space a specific string takes when drawn with a specific font. The \`xfontsel\` program allows the user to view the glyphs of a font. The names of the fonts are arbitrary strings at the level of the X Window core protocol. The X logical font description conventions specify how fonts should be named according to their attributes. These conventions also specify the values of optional properties that can be attached to fonts. The \`xlsfonts\` program prints the list of fonts stored in the server. The \`xfontsel\` program shows the glyphs of fonts, and allows the user to select the name of a font for pasting it in another window. The use of server-side fonts is currently considered deprecated in favour of client-side fonts.Matthieu Herrb and Matthias Hopf. New Evolutions in the X Window System. Such fonts are rendered by the client, not by the server, with the support of the Xft or cairo libraries and the XRender extension. No specification on client-side fonts is given in the core protocol.  Resources and identifiers  All data about windows, pixmaps, fonts, etc. are stored in the server. The client knows identifiers of these objects‚Äîintegers it uses as names for them when interacting with the server. For example, if a client wishes a window to be created, it requests the server to create a window with a given identifier. The identifier can be later used by the client to request, for example, a string to be drawn in the window. The following objects reside in the server and are known by the client via a numerical identifier: * \`Window\` * \`Pixmap\` * \`Font\` * \`Colormap\` (a table of colors, described below) * \`Graphic context\` These objects are called resources. When a client requests the creation of one such resource, it also specifies an identifier for it. For example, for creating a new window, the client specifies both the attributes of the window (parent, width, height, etc.) and the identifier to associate with the window. Identifiers are 32-bit integers with their three most significant bits equal to zero. Every client has its own set of identifiers it can use for creating new resources. This set is specified by the server as two integers included in the acceptance packet (the packet it sends to the client to inform it that the connection is accepted). Clients choose identifiers that are in this set in such a way they do not clash: two objects among windows, pixmaps, fonts, colormaps, and graphic contexts cannot have the same identifier. Once a resource has been created, its identifier is used by the client to request operations about it to the server. Some operations affect the given resource (for example, requests to move windows); others ask for resource data stored from the server (for example, requests for the attributes of windows). Identifiers are unique to the server, not only to the client; for example, no two windows have the same identifier, even if created by two different clients. A client can access any object given its identifier. In particular, it can also access resources created by any other client, even if their identifiers are outside the set of identifiers it can create. As a result, two clients connected to the same server can use the same identifier to refer to the same resource. For example, if a client creates a window of identifier \`0x1e00021\` and passes this number \`0x1e00021\` to another application (via any available means, for example by storing this number in a file that is also accessible to the other application), this other application is able to operate on the very same window. This possibility is for example exploited by the X Window version of Ghostview: this program creates a subwindow, storing its identifier in an environment variable, and calls Ghostscript; this program draws the content of the PostScript file to show in this window. Resources are normally destroyed when the client that created them closes the connection with the server. However, before closing connection, a client can request the server not to destroy them.  Events  Events are packets sent by the server to a client to communicate that something the client may be interested in has happened. For example, an event is sent when the user presses a key or clicks a mouse button. Events are not only used for input: for example, events are sent to indicate the creation of new subwindows of a given window. Every event is relative to a window. For example, if the user clicks when the pointer is in a window, the event will be relative to that window. The event packet contains the identifier of that window. A client can request the server to send an event to another client; this is used for communication between clients. Such an event is for example generated when a client requests the text that is currently selected: this event is sent to the client that is currently handling the window that holds the selection. The \`Expose\` event is sent when an area of a window of destroyed and content is made visible. The content of a window may be destroyed in some conditions, for example, if the window is covered and the server is not maintaining a backing store. The server generates an \`Expose\` event to notify the client that a part of the window has to be drawn. An example of event: when a key is pressed in a window, an event is generated and sent to a client depending on its window event mask, which the client can change. Most kinds of events are sent only if the client previously stated an interest in them. This is because clients may only be interested in some kind of events. For example, a client may be interested in keyboard-related events but not in mouse-related events. Some kinds of events are however sent to clients even if they have not specifically requested them. Clients specify which kinds of events they want to be sent by setting an attribute of a window. For example, in order to redraw a window when its content has been destroyed, a client must receive the \`Expose\` events, which inform it that the window needs to be drawn again. The client will however be sent \`Expose\` events only if the client has previously stated its interest in these events, which is done by appropriately setting the event mask attribute of the window. Different clients can request events on the same window. They can even set different event masks on the same window. For example, a client may request only keyboard events on a window while another client requests only mouse events on the same window. This is possible because the server, for each window, maintains a separate event mask for each client. However, there are some kinds of events that can only be selected by one client at time for each window. In particular, these events report mouse button clicks and some changes related to window management. The \`xev\` program shows the events relative to a window. In particular, \`xev -id WID\` requests all possible events relative to the window of identifier \`WID\` and prints them.  Example  The following is a possible example of interaction between a server and a program that creates a window with a black box in it and exits on a keypress. In this example, the server does not send any reply because the client requests do not generate replies. These requests could generate errors. # The client opens the connection with the server and sends the initial packet specifying the byte order it is using. # The server accepts the connection (no authorization is involved in this example) by sending an appropriate packet, which contains other information such as the identifier of the root window (e.g., \`0x0000002b\`) and which identifiers the client can create. # The client requests the creation of a default graphic context with identifier \`0x00200000\` (this request, like the other requests of this example, does not generate replies from the server) # The client requests the server to create a top-level window (that is, it specifies the parent to be the root window \`0x0000002b\`) with identifier \`0x00200001\`, size 200x200, position (10,10), etc. # The client requests a change in the attributes of the window \`0x00200001\`, specifying it is interested in receiving \`Expose\` and \`KeyPress\` events. # The client requests the window \`0x00200001\` to be mapped (shown on the screen) # When the window is made visible and its content has to be drawn, the server sends the client an \`Expose\` event # In response to this event, the client requests a box to be drawn by sending a \`PolyFillRectangle\` request with window \`0x00200001\` and graphic context \`0x00200000\` If the window is covered by another window and uncovered again, assuming that backing store is not maintained: # The server sends another \`Expose\` event to tell the client that the window has to be drawn again # The client redraws the window by sending a \`PolyFillRectangle\` request If a key is pressed: # The server sends a \`KeyPress\` event to the client to notify it that the user has pressed a key # The client reacts appropriately (in this case, it terminates)  Colors  At the protocol level, a color is represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer, called a pixelvalue. The following elements affect the representation of colors: # the color depth # the colormap, which is a table containing red, green, and blue intensity values # the visual type, which specifies how the table is used to represent colors In the easiest case, the colormap is a table containing a RGB triple in each row. A pixelvalue \`x\` represents the color contained in the \`x\`-th row of the table. If the client can change the entries in the colormap, this representation is identified by the \`PseudoColor\` visual class. The visual class \`StaticColor\` is similar, but the client cannot change the entries in the colormap. There are a total of six possible visual classes, each one identifying a different way for representing an RGB triple with a pixelvalue. \`PseudoColor\` and \`StaticColor\` are two. Another two are \`GrayScale\` and \`StaticGray\`, which differ in that they only display shades of grey. The two remaining visual classes differ from the ones above because they break pixelvalues in three parts and use three separate tables for the red, green, and blue intensity. According to this color representation, a pixelvalue is converted into an RGB triple as follows: # the pixelvalue is seen as a sequence of bits # this sequence is broken in three parts # each of these three chunks of bits is seen as an integer and used as an index to find a value in each of three separate tables This mechanism requires the colormap to be composed of three separate tables, one for each primary color. The result of the conversion is still a triple of intensity values. The visual classes using this representation are the \`DirectColor\` and \`TrueColor\` ones, differing on whether the client can change colormaps or not. These six mechanisms for representing colors with pixelvalues all require some additional parameters to work. These parameters are collected into a visual type, which contains a visual class and other parameters of the representation of colors. Each server has a fixed set of visualtypes, each one associated with a numerical identifier. These identifiers are 32-bit unsigned integers, but are not necessarily different from identifiers of resources or atoms. When the connection from a client is accepted, the acceptance packet sent by the server contains a sequence of blocks, each one containing information about a single screen. For each screen, the relative block contains a list of other blocks, each one relative to a specific color depth that is supported by the screen. For each supported depth, this list contains a list of visualtypes. As a result, each screen is associated a number of possible depths, and each depth of each screen is associated a number of possible visual types. A given visual type can be used for more screens and for different depths. For each visual type, the acceptance packet contains both its identifier and the actual parameters it contains (visual class, etc.) The client stores this information, as it cannot request it afterwards. Moreover, clients cannot change or create new visual types. Requests for creation of a new window include the depth and the identifier of the visual type to use for representing colors of this window. Colormaps are used regardless of whether the hardware controlling the screen (e.g., a graphic card) uses a palette, which is a table that is also used for representing colors. Servers use colormaps even if the hardware is not using a palette. Whenever the hardware uses palettes, only a limited number of colormaps can be installed. In particular, a colormap is installed when the hardware shows colors according to it. A client can request the server to install a colormap. However, this may require the uninstalling of another colormap: the effect is that windows using the uninstalled colormap are not shown with the correct color, an effect dubbed color flashing or technicolor. This problem can be solved using standard colormaps, which are colormaps with a predictable association between pixelvalues and colors. Thanks to this property, standard colormaps can be used by different applications. The creation of colormaps is regulated by the ICCCM convention. Standard colormaps are regulated by the ICCCM and by the Xlib specification. A part of the X colour system is the X Color Management System (xcms). This system was introduced with X11R6 Release 5 in 1991. This system consists of several additional features in xlib, found in the Xcms* series of functions. This system defines device independent color schemes which can be converted into device dependent RGB systems. The system consists of the xlib Xcms* functions and as well the X Device Color Characterization Convention (XDCCC) which describes how to convert the various device independent colour systems into device dependent RGB colour systems. This system supports the CIEXYZ, xyY, CIELUV and CIELAB and as well the TekHVC colour systems. ,  Atoms  Atoms are 32-bit integers representing strings. The protocol designers introduced atoms because they represent strings in a short and fixed size:David Rosenthal. Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual. MIT X Consortium Standard, 1989 while a string may be arbitrarily long, an atom is always a 32-bit integer. Atom brevity was exploited by mandating their use in the kinds of packets that are likely to be sent many times with the same strings; this results in a more efficient use of the network. The fixed size of atoms was exploited by specifying a fixed size for events, namely 32 bytes: fixed-size packets can contain atoms, while they cannot contain long strings. Precisely, atoms are identifiers of strings stored in the server. They are similar to the identifiers of resources (Windows, Pixmaps, etc.) but differ from them in two ways. First, the identifiers of atoms are chosen by the server, not by the client. In other words, when a client requests the creation of a new atom, it only sends the server the string to be stored, not its identifier; this identifier is chosen by the server and sent back as a reply to the client. The second important difference between resources and atoms is that atoms are not associated with clients. Once created, an atom survives until the server quits or resets (this is not the default behavior of resources). Atoms are identifiers and are therefore unique. However, an atom and a resource identifier can coincide. The string associated with an atom is called the atom name. The name of an atom cannot be changed after creation, and no two atoms can have the same name. As a result, the name of an atom is commonly used to indicate the atom: ‚Äúthe atom \`ABCD\`‚Äù means, more precisely, ‚Äúthe atom whose associated string is \`ABCD\`.‚Äù or ‚Äúthe atom whose name is \`ABCD\`.‚Äù A client can request the creation of a new atom and can request for the atom (the identifier) of a given string. Some atoms are predefined (created by the server with given identifier and string). Atoms are used for a number of purposes, mostly related to communication between different clients connected to the same server. In particular, they are used in association with the properties of windows, which are described below. The list of all atoms residing in a server can be printed out using the program \`xlsatoms\`. In particular, this program prints each atom (the identifier, that is, a number) with its name (its associated string).  Properties  Every window has a predefined set of attributes and a set of properties, all stored in the server and accessible to the clients via appropriate requests. Attributes are data about the window, such as its size, position, background color, etc. Properties are arbitrary pieces of data attached to a window. Unlike attributes, properties have no meaning at the level of the X Window core protocol. A client can store arbitrary data in a property of a window. A property is characterized by a name, a type, and a value. Properties are similar to variables in imperative programming languages, in that a client can create a new property with a given name and type and store a value in it. Properties are associated to windows: two properties with the same name can exist on two different windows while having different types and values. The name, type, and value of a property are strings; more precisely, they are atoms, that is, strings stored in the server and accessible to the clients via identifiers. A client application can access a given property by using the identifier of the atom containing the name of the property. Properties are mostly used for inter-client communication. For example, the property named \`WM_NAME\` (the property named by the atom whose associated string is \`\\"WM_NAME\\"\`) is used for storing the name of windows. Window managers typically read this property to display the name of windows in their title bar. Some types of inter-client communication use properties of the root window. For example, according to the freedesktop window manager specification, window managers should store the identifier of the currently active window in the property named \`_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\` of the root window. The X resources, which contain parameters of programs, are also stored in properties of the root window; this way, all clients can access them, even if running on different computers. The \`xprop\` program prints the properties of a given window; \`xprop -root\` prints the name, type, and value of each property of the root window.  Mappings  This key always generates the same keycode, but the symbols \`/\`, \`7\`, and \`{\` are associated to three different keysyms. In the X Window System, every individual, physical key is associated a number in the range 8‚Äì255, called its keycode. A keycode only identifies a key, not a particular character or term (e.g., \\"Page Up\\") among the ones that may be printed on the key. Each one of these characters or terms is instead identified by a keysym. While a keycode only depends on the actual key that is pressed, a keysym may depend, for example, on whether the Shift key or another modifier was also pressed. When a key is pressed or released, the server sends events of type \`KeyPress\` or \`KeyRelease\` to the appropriate clients. These events contain: # the keycode of the pressed key # the current state of the modifiers (Shift, Control, etc.) and mouse buttons Translation from keycode to keysym. The server therefore sends the keycode and the modifier state without attempting to translate them into a specific character. It is a responsibility of the client to do this conversion. For example, a client may receive an event stating that a given key has been pressed while the Shift modifier was down. If this key would normally generate the character \\"a\\", the client (and not the server) associates this event to the character \\"A\\". While the translation from keycodes to keysyms is done by the client, the table that represents this association is maintained by the server. Storing this table in a centralized place makes it accessible to all clients. Typical clients only request this mapping and use it for decoding the keycode and modifiers field of a key event into a keysym. However, clients can also change this mapping at will. A modifier is a key that, when pressed, changes the interpretation of other keys. A common modifier is the Shift key: when the key that normally produces a lowercase \\"a\\" is pressed together with Shift, it produces an uppercase \\"A\\". Other common modifiers are \\"Control\\", \\"Alt\\", and \\"Meta\\". The X server works with at most eight modifiers. However, each modifier can be associated with more than one key. This is necessary because many keyboards have duplicated keys for some modifiers. For example, many keyboards have two \\"Shift\\" keys (one on the left and one on the right). These two keys produce two different keycodes when pressed, but the X server associates both with the \\"Shift\\" modifier. For each of the eight modifiers, the X server maintains a list of the keycodes that it consider to be that modifier. As an example, if the list of the first modifier (the \\"Shift\\" modifier) contains the keycode \`0x37\`, then the key that produces the keycode \`0x37\` is considered a shift key by the X server. The lists of modifier mappings is maintained by the X server but can be changed by every client. For example, a client can request the \\"F1 key\\" to be added to the list of \\"Shift\\" modifiers. From this point on, this key behaves like another shift modifier. However, the keycode corresponding to F1 is still generated when this key is pressed. As a result, F1 operates as it did before (for example, a help window may be opened when it is pressed), but also operates like the shift key (pressing \\"a\\" in a text editor while F1 is down adds \\"A\\" to the current text). The X server maintains and uses a modifier mapping for the mouse buttons. However, the buttons can only be permuted. This is mostly useful for exchanging the leftmost and rightmost button for left-handed users. The \`xmodmap\` program shows and changes the key, modifier, and mouse button mappings.  Grabs  A grab is a condition in which all keyboard or mouse events are sent to a single client. A client can request a grab of the keyboard, the mouse, or both: if the request is fulfilled by the server, all keyboard/mouse events are sent to the grabbing client until the grab is released. The other clients will not receive these events. When requesting a grab, a client specifies a grab window: all events are sent to the grabbing client as if they were relative to the grab window. However, the other clients do not receive events even if they have selected them in the grab window. There are two kinds of grabs: * active: the grab takes place immediately * passive: the grab takes place only when a previously specified key or mouse button is pressed and terminates when it is released If the pointer or the keyboard are frozen, the events they generate are blocked in a queue. If they are grabbed, their events are rerouted to the grabbing client instead of the window that normally receives them. Pointer events can be discarded depending on an event mask. A client can establish a grab over the keyboard, the pointer, or both. A request for grabbing can include a request for freezing the keyboard or the pointer. The difference between grabbing and freezing is that grabbing changes the recipient of events, while freezing stops their delivery altogether. When a device is frozen, the events it generates are stored in a queue to be delivered as usual when the freeze is over. For pointer events, an additional parameter affects the delivery of events: an event mask, which specifies which types of events are to be delivered and which ones are to be discarded. The requests for grabbing include a field for specifying what happens to events that would be sent to the grabbing client even if it had not established the grab. In particular, the client can request them to be sent as usual or according to the grab. These two conditions are not the same as they may appear. For example, a client that would normally receive the keyboard events on a first window may request the keyboard to be grabbed by a second window. Events that would normally be sent to the first window may or may not be redirected to the grab window depending on the parameter in the grab request. A client can also request the grab of the entire server. In this case, no request will be processed by the server except the ones coming from the grabbing client.  Other  Other requests and events in the core protocol exist. The first kind of requests is relative to the parent relationship between windows: a client can request to change the parent of a window, or can request information about the parenthood of windows. Other requests are relative to the selection, which is however mostly governed by other protocols. Other requests are about the input focus and the shape of the pointer. A client can also request the owner of a resource (window, pixmap, etc.) to be killed, which causes the server to terminate the connection with it. Finally, a client can send a no-operation request to the server.  Extensions  The shape extension allows oclock to create a round window. The X Window core protocol was designed to be extensible. The core protocol specifies a mechanism for querying the available extensions and how extension requests, events, and errors packets are made. In particular, a client can request the list of all available extensions for data relative to a specific extension. The packets of extensions are similar to the packets of the core protocol. The core protocol specifies that request, event, and error packets contain an integer indicating its type (for example, the request for creating a new window is numbered 1). A range of these integers are reserved for extensions.  Authorization  When the client initially establishes a connection with the server, the server can reply by either accepting the connection, refusing it, or requesting authentication. An authentication request contains the name of the authentication method to use. The core protocol does not specify the authentication process, which depends on the kind of authentication used, other than it ends with the server either sending an acceptance or a refusal packet. During the regular interaction between a client and a server, the only requests related to authentication are about the host-based access method. In particular, a client can request this method to be enabled and can request reading and changing the list of hosts (clients) that are authorized to connect. Typical applications do not use these requests; they are used by the \`xhost\` program to give a user or a script access to the host access list. The host-based access method is considered insecure. Xlib and other client libraries  Most client programs communicate with the server via the Xlib client library. In particular, most clients use libraries such as Xaw, Motif, GTK+, or Qt which in turn use Xlib for interacting with the server. The use of Xlib has the following effects: # Xlib makes the client synchronous with respect to replies and events: ## the Xlib functions that send requests block until the appropriate replies, if any is expected, are received; in other words, an X Window client not using Xlib can send a request to the server and then do other operations while waiting for the reply, but a client using Xlib can only call an Xlib function that sends the request and wait for the reply, thus blocking the client while waiting for the reply (unless the client starts a new thread before calling the function); ## while the server sends events asynchronously, Xlib stores events received by the client in a queue; the client program can only access them by explicitly calling functions of the X11 library; in other words, the client is forced to block or busy-wait if expecting an event. # Xlib does not send requests to the server immediately, but stores them in a queue, called the output buffer; the requests in the output buffer are actually sent when: ## the program explicitly requests so by calling a library function such as \`XFlush\`; ## the program calls a function that gives as a result something that involve a reply from the server, such as \`XGetWindowAttributes\`; ## the program asks for an event in the event queue (for example, by calling \`XNextEvent\`) and the call blocks (for example, \`XNextEvent\` blocks if the queue is empty.) Higher-level libraries such as Xt (which is in turn used by Xaw and Motif) allow the client program to specify the callback functions associated with some events; the library takes care of polling the event queue and calling the appropriate function when required; some events such as those indicating the need of redrawing a window are handled internally by Xt. Lower- level libraries, such as XCB, provide asynchronous access to the protocol, allowing better latency hiding. Unspecified parts The X Window System core protocol does not mandate over inter-client communication and does not specify how windows are used to form the visual elements that are common in graphical user interfaces (buttons, menus, etc.). Graphical user interface elements are defined by client libraries realizing widget toolkits. Inter-client communication is covered by other standards such as the ICCCM and freedesktop specifications. Inter-client communication is relevant to selections, cut buffers, and drag-and-drop, which are the methods used by a user to transfer data from a window to another. Since the windows may be controlled by different programs, a protocol for exchanging this data is necessary. Inter- client communication is also relevant to X window managers, which are programs that control the appearance of the windows and the general look-and-feel of the graphical user interface. Yet another issue where inter-client communication is to some extent relevant is that of session management. How a user session starts is another issue that is not covered by the core protocol. Usually, this is done automatically by the X display manager. The user can however also start a session manually running the xinit or startx programs.

On June 30, 1984, a performance at the venue by the Jefferson Starship was broadcast live nationwide by the ABC Rock Radio Network. The fairgrounds are surrounded by dense residential developments, and the amphitheatre was the focus of numerous noise complaints from local residents, prior to being closed in the early 1990s. After almost a decade, it was reopened in 2003, in conjunction with the annual Orange County Fair. As part of an agreement with local residents, concerts are only held concurrently with the fair. Since its reopening, the venue rarely uses the \\"lawn\\" area, effectively reducing seating capacity from approximately 18,765 to 8,500. After further construction and improvements in 2015, the seating was reduced to 8,000. In addition to concerts, the location is the site of commencement for nearby Orange Coast College.

He then moved into editorial positions with some of Toronto's large publishing houses, including McClelland and Stewart and Hurtig. During that period, he edited George Grant's Lament for a Nation, and served as managing editor of the Tamarack Review, at the time the leading literary quarterly. Writing career In the early 1970s, Colombo began working on the first of many anthologies, a collection of quotations from prominent Canadians titled Colombo's Canadian Quotations. Following the success of the quotations collection, Colombo went on to publish dozens of collections, ranging from bibliographies of Canadian reference works to collections of folk tales, stories of the paranormal, and UFO sightings. As of 2014, Colombo has published over 200 titles, making him the second-most prolific author in Canadian literary history. His anthology writing earned him the nickname \\"the Master Gatherer\\" amongst Canadian writers and literary critics. He has also been dubbed \\"Canada's Mr. Mystery\\" for his compilations of the paranormal. In the 1990s, Colombo began publishing his writing through his own imprint, Colombo and Company.

Violet Amirault (1923‚Äì1997) opened the facility in 1966. Accusations and investigation In 1984, a four-year-old student at the Fells Acres Day School wet himself while napping. Upon direction by the child's teacher, Gerald Amirault changed the boy into spare clothing. Later that year the boy was discovered playing sexually-suggestive games with his cousin. After being questioned about this by his mother and uncle, who himself had allegedly been molested as a child, the boy said that Amirault had sexually abused him. Soon thereafter, Amirault was arrested on charges of raping the boy. The police called the parents of all the children to a meeting at the police station to discuss the situation. They were instructed to go home and interview their children and to look for signs of sexual abuse. Examples of behaviors parents were told were symptomatic of abuse included bed wetting, changes in appetite and nightmares. The children were also questioned by the police, social workers, therapists, and others. Arrests and trial Eventually, Amirault was charged with molesting more children, and charges were brought against his mother, Violet Amirault, and sister, Cheryl Amirault LeFave. In 1986, Gerald Amirault was convicted of assaulting and raping nine children and sentenced to 30 to 40 years in prison. In 1987, by a separate trial, his mother and sister were convicted of similar crimes against four children and sentenced to jail for eight to 20 years. At both trials the children testified in open court sitting directly in front of the jury with their backs to the defendants and their faces to the jurors. Interviews of children as evidence Much of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' case depended on the information obtained in the interviews of the children who were allegedly sexually abused by the Amiraults. The interviews claimed that the children were raped with knives, sticks, forks, and magic wands; were assaulted by a clown (allegedly Gerald) in a \\"secret room\\" and a \\"magic room\\"; were forced to drink urine; were tied naked to a tree; and many other acts. The main criticism of this case was directed to reliability of the information obtained from the children. The bulk of the evidence was developed through videotaped interviews conducted by Susan J. Kelley, a pediatric nurse. The children repeatedly told interviewers, including Kelley, that nothing happened to them, that there were no secret rooms, and there was no clown. However, the questioning continued and eventually the children claimed all these things happened. One police officer, John Rivers, said at a seminar that interviewing the children was \\"like getting blood from a stone\\". At one point, an interviewer told a child that the child's friend had already testified that the clown had them take their clothes off. The girl being interviewed denied this happened, at which point the interviewer said that she believed what the child's friend told her. Kelley also rejected alternative explanations for events and ignored the children's denials of the abuse scenarios. The chief prosecutor of both of the Amirault cases maintained that \\"the children testified to being photographed and molested by acts that included penetration by objects ... the implication ... that the children's allegations of abuse were tainted by improper interviewing is groundless and not true.\\" Post trial Superior Court Judge John Paul Sullivan reduced Violet and Cheryl's sentences, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reversed that ruling in 1993.Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly, Editorial: Travesty of Justice, Sept. 13, 1999. In 1995, after serving eight years in state prison, Violet and Cheryl were freed on a successful appeal. A Lowell Superior Court judge ruled that their convictions were wrongful because they were not able to directly confront their accusers. However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reinstated the conviction, citing the need for \\"finality\\". While awaiting this verdict, Violet Amirault died. After this, another judge, Isaac Borenstein, granted two separate motions for new trials.Commonweath v. LeFave, Proceedings, June 12, 1998 Commonwealth v. LeFave, Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law, and Order on Defendant's Motion For New Trial Borenstein ruled that the children's interrogations were so tainted by \\"grave errors\\" in the investigation process that they could not be used in any new trial. He explained that: > These grave errors led to the testimony of the children being forever > tainted. The only allegations made by the child witnesses occurred after > they were subjected to the admittedly suggestive interviews, and > investigative techniques, as well as inappropriate - even if understandable > - influence by their families. Moreover, neither behavioral symptoms nor > physical evidence which may be consistent with child sexual abuse were > revealed until after the children and their families were subjected to these > improper interviewing and investigative techniques. These alleged symptoms > were only discussed after the families were overwhelmed by the panic, > hysteria and media attention that snowballed this case into national > headlines and widespread concern about ritualistic sexual abuse of children. Charles M. Sennott published an article in the newspaper The Boston Globe that was sympathetic with the Amiraults and reported that Miriam Holmes, who was assigned as a counselor by the Department of Corrections to Violet and Cheryl, and Joel Skolnick, who counseled Cheryl, believed that both women were innocent. Joel Skolnick, LICSW, interviewed Cheryl Amirault while she was incarcerated in MCI Framingham as well as reviewed transcripts of interviews administered by the Department of Social Services. Skolnick determined that the interviews were not administered properly and biased the children's responses, making them unreliable. Furthermore, he noted that the vast majority of sex offenders will readily confess to their crimes if offered freedom in exchange for doing so, and that because of this the steadfast refusal of the Amiraults to do the same was further indication of their innocence. A study by Dr. Maggie Bruck of hundreds of children aged 4 to 6 found that the kind of prolonged, repeated questioning used on the children in the Amirault case frequently results in false reports. Other studies had shown that the method of interrogation via anatomically correct dolls also had an incredibly great margin of error. However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court once again ruled to send the women back to prison. During October 1999, the new Middlesex County District Attorney, Martha Coakley, and Cheryl Amirault LeFave reached an agreement whereby Cheryl would be sentenced to the time served and she was released from prison. In exchange, Cheryl agreed to 10 years probation, and also could not give any television interviews, could not contact the families of the victims, could have no unsupervised contact with children, and could not profit in any way from her trial and imprisonment. The Massachusetts parole board recommended the commutation of Gerald Amirault's sentence during July 2001 (an action that the alleged victims strenuously objected to). The then‚ÄìActing Governor, Jane Swift, rejected the decision during February 2002. Amirault was ultimately released from the Bay State Correctional Center on April 30, 2004.

Moscow, Russia. New Year trees are decorated trees similar to Christmas trees that are displayed to specifically celebrate the New Year. They should not be confused with the practice of leaving up a Christmas tree until after New Year's Day. New Year trees are common in various cultures and nations, chiefly the former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Turkey, China and Vietnam. Russian and Turkish traditions Russian and Turkish New Year trees are of the same varieties as those used for Christmas trees, although a spruce tree is the most usual type. The decorations are the same as for Christmas trees. While Russian and Turkish North Americans purchasing a tree after Christmas when prices have plummeted might enjoy notable savings, most do not wait beyond Christmas to buy their trees. =History of the Soviet New Year Tree= Bezbozhnik, distributed by the League of Militant Atheists, depicting an Orthodox Christian priest being forbidden to cut down a tree for Christmas The tradition of installing and decorating a —ë–ª–∫–∞ (pr: yolka, tr: spruce tree) for Christmas dates back to the 17th century when Peter the Great imported the practice as a result of his travels in Europe. Peter decreed in 1699 that the New Year will be celebrated on 1 January instead of 1 September, and that \\"Fir tree, pine and juniper branches and trees shall be used to decorate houses and gateways along main streets\\".December, 20 in history. russiapedia.rt.com (Accessed 24 January 2016) However, in Imperial Russia, yolka were banned beginning in 1916 by the Synod as a tradition originating in Germany (Russia's enemy during World War I). After the revolution of 1917, Christmas celebrations‚Äîalong with other religious holidays‚Äîwere discouraged and de facto prohibited as a result of the Soviet antireligious campaign. Fir Markets The League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with Soviet anti-religious legislation, people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees. The New Year tree was encouraged in the USSR after the famous letter by Pavel Postyshev, published in Pravda on 28 December 1935, in which he asked for trees to be installed in schools, children's homes, Young Pioneer Palaces, children's clubs, children's theaters and cinemas. Legend of a man, who presented Soviet children with New Year's tree In his letter, Postyshev wrote: In 1937, a Novy God (New Year) Tree was also installed in the Moscow House of the Unions. An invitation to the Yolka at the Palace of Unions became a matter of honour for Soviet children. After the dissolution of the USSR, stigma against religion subsided amidst renewed public interest. =History of the Turkish New Year tree= New year decorations in a Turkish home A Turkish New Year tree, in Turkish Yƒ±lba≈üƒ± Aƒüacƒ±, looks the same as a Christmas tree with Christmas ornaments. It is called a New Year tree because it is specific to the New Year and, with about 95% of Turkey's population Muslim, most Turks do not celebrate Christmas. After the modernisation of Turkey, the Islamic calendar and the fiscal calendar were replaced by the Gregorian calendar and New Year celebrations started in the late 1920s. The celebrations became popular in Turkey and Christmas trees were brought into the country as New Year trees. Since then, the custom of setting up a tree for the New Year is a traditional event in Turkey. It is usually put up between the beginning of December and the end of January, the mid date being New Year's Eve. Also, the habit of giving presents at Christmas was changed to the giving of New Year presents. The New Year tree can be considered an example of westernised Turkish culture or Turkified European culture. Vietnamese and Cantonese custom T·∫øt Chinese New Year tree Planting a New Year tree or c√¢y n√™u is also a Vietnamese custom that is part of the springtime T·∫øt festival. Often a bamboo pole serves as the \\"tree\\". Hoa ƒë√†o (in Northern) or Hoa mai (in Southern) and kumquat trees are also decorated and displayed in Vietnamese homes during T·∫øt. In Cantonese, the new year tree is called Nin Fa (, literally New Year Flower). Bamboo is just one of the new year trees for the Cantonese, the others being mandarin and peach. The mandarin plant is called Kat (), which is a homophone to , standing for good luck. The peach flower stands for good relationships; love is one of the relationships, so it's also a wish for love.

It was first released on the 1981 compilation album A Christmas Record on ZE Records, and also appears on the Waitresses' 1982 EP I Could Rule the World If I Could Only Get the Parts and numerous Christmas holiday compilation albums. It was written and produced by Chris Butler, with vocals by Patty Donahue. The song received positive reviews and AllMusic described it as \\"one of the best holiday pop tunes ever recorded.\\" Writing In 1981, ZE Records asked each of its artists to record a Christmas song for a Christmas compilation album, A Christmas Record. Songwriter Chris Butler wrote the song in August that year, assembling it from assorted unused riffs. He finished the lyrics in a taxi cab on the way to the recording studio. The lyrics came from Butler's hatred of Christmas: \\"Everybody I knew in New York was running around like a bunch of fiends. It wasn't about joy. It was something to cope with.\\" Written while hip hop music was beginning to gain prominence, the song is \\"almost rapped\\" by vocalist Patty Donahue. Its title is a pun on \\"rapping\\", and was a spoof on the name of the 1979 song \\"Christmas Rappin'\\" by Kurtis Blow. Beyond that, the title is a play on the lyrics themselves: Butler explained in an interview that he \\"liked the idea of the word 'wrap,' like a wraparound, because the story is circular\\". Lyrics The song is told from the perspective of a busy single woman adamant not to participate in the exhausting Christmas period. She has \\"turned down all [her] invites\\" and resolves to \\"miss this one this year\\". Earlier in the year, she met an appealing man at a ski shop and got his number, but had no time to ask him out. Despite their attempts to meet in the following months, a succession of mishaps keeps them apart. On Christmas Eve, the woman is roasting \\"the world's smallest turkey\\" for herself when she realizes she has forgotten to buy cranberries. At a 24-hour grocery store, she runs into the man, who has also forgotten to buy cranberries, bringing her Christmas \\"to a very happy ending\\". In the final refrain, she admits that she \\"couldn't miss this one this year\\". Release and reception The song was an immediate and unexpected success. According to Butler, the Waitresses were in the middle of a difficult tour and the Christmas song commission was \\"the last thing we wanted\\". He recalled later that its enthusiastic reception was a rejuvenating gift for the band: \\"We do the Christmas song, forget about it and go back on the road. The next thing I know when calling back to New York is that it's all over the radio and much to our surprise it leaps over our heads and hits all the cities where we're heading and all of a sudden we're back on an upswing again.\\" The song was released as a single in the UK in 1981 on Island Records. Although it did not make the charts that year, it was reissued in 1982 and reached No. 45 on the official UK Singles Chart in December 1982. Writing in 2005, Guardian arts journalist Dorian Lynskey called the song \\"fizzing, funky dance-around-the- Christmas-tree music for Brooklyn hipsters.\\" In 2012, Daily Telegraph writer Bernadette McNulty called it \\"one of the most charming, insouciant festive songs ever.\\" AllMusic reviewer Andy Hinds called it \\"one of the best holiday pop tunes ever recorded.\\" Commercial performance On the UK Official Singles chart, \\"Christmas Wrapping\\" peaked at number 45, spending two weeks there. It remains the group's highest-charting single there. During the 2016 holiday season, the song experienced a resurgence in popularity in the UK, re- entering the singles chart at number 96. The song has since been featured on numerous holiday music compilations including The Edge of Christmas, Dr. Demento's Holidays in Dementia, and Now That's What I Call Christmas!: The Signature Collection. Covers \\"Christmas Wrapping\\" has been covered by numerous artists. It was covered by the British pop group Spice Girls as a B-side for their 1998 single \\"Goodbye\\", with lyrics altered to include a reference to British supermarket chain Tesco. It has also been covered by Save Ferris (with lyrics altered for a Jewish perspective), Kate Nash, the Front Bottoms, the Donnas, Summer Camp, the cast of the Broadway musical Wicked, Miranda Cosgrove, comedian Doug Benson, Martha Wainwright, the cast of the TV show Glee with Heather Morris on lead vocals, and Disney Channel star Bella Thorne. British/Irish girl band the Saturdays did a cover of the song for the film Get Santa. Australian singer Kylie Minogue recorded the song for her 2015 album, Kylie Christmas.

Their son, Dan McKenzie, was a Cambridge geophysicist instrumental in developing plate tectonics. During the Second World War, Fairbrother left London with their two sons for the safety of the Buckinghamshire countryside, and wrote her first book, Children in the House (1954), about the experience of living there while her husband was away serving with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Her most celebrated work is New Lives, New Landscapes (1970), a visionary account of the challenges facing land-use planning in the United Kingdom. Fairbrother's influence on planners, landscape architects, and educators continues today: in 2009, BBC Scotland Learning produced two programmes in their Industry series (first televised in January 2009), titled New lives, new landscapes, an acknowledgment of Fairbrother's contribution. In 1987 the Fairbrother Group of urban wildlife organisations was established and named in her memory, which ultimately became the Urban Wildlife Network.

The village is just west of Thrapston and east of Kettering. The parish is bounded to the east by the River Nene and to the north by Harpurs Brook, a tributary of the Nene. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 829 people.Office for National Statistics: Islip CP: Parish headcounts Retrieved 16 July 2015. Parish church Islip had a parish church by the early 13th century but the present Perpendicular Gothic Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was built early in the 15th century. St. Nicholas' shares a benefice with the parishes of Thrapston and Denford. Social and economic history The manor of Islip was held by Geoffrey de Mowbray, Bishop of Coutances in 1086. When he lost his English estates a few years later due to rebellion, the Crown granted part of the manor to Westminster Abbey and, in the early 12th century, part to Aubrey de Vere II, a royal chamberlain. Aubrey's son Robert held in Islip, Drayton, and Addington, Northamptonshire.Victoria County History of Northamptonshire, vol. III, p. 215. Matthias Nicoll moved to New York from Islip in 1664. He was Mayor of New York in 1671. The town of Islip in Suffolk County, New York is named after the Northamptonshire village. = The Iron Industry = Quarrying for iron ore began to the south west of the village in 1869. An ironworks was built close to the quarries and next to the Kettering to Huntingdon railway. The works began production of pig iron in 1873. The works became the centre of a network of quarries and mines not just near Islip but in the surrounding district over the next seventy or so years. Tramways brought the ore to the works from the immediate area as well as from Slipton,Twywell,Lowick and Sudborough. Most of the ore was smelted in the Islip works but at various times it was also taken to works at Wellingborough, Corby and further afield. This ore was transhipped into main line rail wagons at the sidings that were built next to the iron works. The Islip quarries were worked for iron ore on and off up to 1919 and again in 1933. Limestone was also quarried between 1900 and 1931. An iron mine called the Church Mine was begun 1910 The entrance was from one of the Islip quarries. Another mine was begun in 1923 with an entrance near Lowick called Church Mine North.The tramways in the open air were built to a 3 foot gauge but in the mines there were 2 foot 6 inch tramways. Haulage was at first by horses but from 1875 steam locomotives were introduced on the 3 foot gauge. In the mines horses were used throughout although things changed in the 1930s. The quarries,mines and works come under the control of the company that ran the Corby ironworks in 1930. They increased production and in 1933 the Church Mine and Church Mine North were connected underground. Henceforward the southern entrance close to the works was used.for both mines. They introduced diesel locomotives in the mines from 1933 except in the headings where horses were still used. In 1933 production was doubled over 1933. The ironworks continued production until 1942. During that time the works produced iron for casting, whereas the Corby works produced basic iron for steel making (from 1936 at the new Corby Steel Works.) In 1941 there was a proposal to convert the 3 foot gauge tramways to standard gauge and to connect them to the Corby works system to enable transport to those works without transhipment (except at the mine exit) or use of the main line railway route through Kettering. However this never happened. The quarries and mines at Slipton had closed by this time. The mine closed in 1947 and the Twywell quarries in 1948.The quarries at Lowick and Sudborough continued until 1952, still sending their ore by tramway past the village of Islip to the Islip sidings for transhipment to the main line. Calcined ore which had been left near to the ironworks was extracted until 1969.Tonks. Page 154 The site of the iron works was occupied by various industrial and commercial concerns after closure. Some of the original buildings remain but others have been demolished. Some traces remain of the quarries but much has been filled in with landfill rubbish or otherwise. Similarly some traces of the tramways remain. The entrances to the mines have been sealed but in one place the surface above the mine collapsed.in 1985.

Biography Harold Ainsworth Peto was born in London on 11 July 1854. He was the son of a prosperous builder, engineer and railway-contractor, Samuel Morton Peto, of Somerleyton Hall in Lowestoft, Suffolk, and of Sarah Ainsworth (n√©e Kelsall), his father's second wife. Harold had four step-brothers and -sisters and ten brothers and sisters. Somerleyton Hall, where Harold spent his boyhood, had been rebuilt in the 1840s in Neo-Renaissance style and had a large winter garden and a parterre designed by William Andrews Nesfield. In 1855 Harold's father was made a baronet; but in the 1860s his businesses ran into trouble, so that in 1863 he sold Somerleyton Hall and in 1866 became bankrupt.E. C. Brooks, Sir Samuel Morton Peto (1996. Bury Clerical Society) Briefly Harold was sent to board at Harrow School (1869‚Äì1871), but he left school at seventeen and did not pursue a higher education. Iford Manor garden feature On leaving school he was apprenticed to a joiner for nearly a year, then entered the practice of the architects J. Clements of Lowestoft. A year later he joined the London architects, Karslake and Mortimers. In 1876 Peto went into partnership with architect Ernest George ‚Äì a partnership which would last sixteen years. He and George designed houses in Kensington and Chelsea, as well as country houses.H. Grainger, The Architecture of Sir Ernest George and his partners [Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds] (1985) In 1883 Peto became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA); but ill health compelled him to leave London.A. Stuart Gray, Edwardian Architects, A Biographical Dictionary (1985), , p. 284. During these years he kept diaries recording his extensive travels to Italy, America, SpainR. Whalley, 'Harold Peto's Spanish diary 1888', in Hortus; 55 (2000 Autumn) and Greece. In 1892 Peto ended his partnership with Ernest George, and based himself in Kent (1892‚Äì1895) and afterwards at Landford Lodge near Salisbury (1896‚Äì1899). Again these were years of travel: to Egypt, Italy, Germany and France; and in 1898 he made a round-the-world tour which included Japan.R. Whalley, 'Harold Peto's Japanese diary', in Hortus; 36 (1995 winter) and 37 (1996 spring) In 1899 Peto purchased and moved to Iford Manor in Wiltshire, having visited it that year with his friend, Henry Avray Tipping. Harold made Iford his permanent base. He re-designed and expanded the garden, trying out new ideas, and incorporating the artefacts collected during his travels around the world. The garden at Iford illustrates particularly his Arts and crafts approach to architecture and garden design. The Italian Garden on Ilnacullin Most of Peto's major commissions were executed between 1900 and 1914. His projects include work at Easton Lodge, Essex; West Dean House, Sussex; Crichel House, Dorset; Petwood, Lincolnshire; High Wall, Oxford; Buscot Park, Oxfordshire; Hartham Park, Wiltshire; Bridge House, Surrey; Heale House, Wiltshire; Wayford Manor House, Somerset; Burton Pynsent House, Somerset; Ilnacullin, County Cork, Ireland. He also designed a series of gardens in Mediterranean France ‚Äì at Cannes the Isola Bella, and at Cap Ferrat the villas Sylvia, Maryland and Rosemary. A good example of Peto's garden architecture can be seen at West Dean House, Sussex, now housing West Dean College, where his pergola is a highlight of the gardens. Peto and Ernest George also directed an extension of West Dean House for William James (father of poet Edward James, patron of the Surrealist art movement); they created the Oak Room, the old dining room and the staircase, all of which can still be seen within West Dean College.West Dean website Peto was also interested in interior design, and in 1907 he was commissioned to design the first-class accommodation aboard the trans-Atlantic liner Mauretania.P.

It is located in the towns of Shandaken, Denning and Olive in Ulster County.  Location  Within those three towns, the Slide Wilderness might be better described as contained within the lands bounded on the north roughly by Esopus Creek and Route 28, the east by Ulster County Route 42 (known in different towns as Sundown Road or Peekamoose Road) almost to the shores of Ashokan Reservoir, the west by Ulster County Route 47, and on the south by Sugarloaf Road and Red Hill Road. The area's wilderness character is buffered not only by restrictive local zoning and conservation of neighboring private lands but also by bordering on two other large state-owned tracts, the Big Indian-Beaver Kill Wilderness Area to the west and the Sundown Wild Forest to the east. Resources =Physical= According to Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish, the Slide wilderness contains the most extensive tract of first-growth forest in the Catskills. Much of the area remained out of reach during the peak years of logging and barkpeeling from eastern hemlock trees, to make tannin for leather production in the mid-19th century, and thus remained largely untouched. Indeed, the upper valley of the East Branch of the Neversink, located centrally within the SMWA, is the only completely wild valley in the Catskills. It is possible to look out over it from several points on the surrounding mountains and see no evidence of civilization. Within its boundaries lie 10 of the 35 Catskill High Peaks, including the highest Catskill peak, Slide, 4,180 feet (1277 m) of elevation; and lowest, Rocky. Three important regional streams arise within the wilderness as well: the Neversink River, largest tributary of the Delaware; and Hudson tributaries Rondout and Esopus creeks, both of which are impounded to create major reservoirs for the New York City water supply system. There are, however, no lakes or ponds within it. =Biological= Plant life The tract is almost completely wooded. DEC identifies five distinct forest communities within the Slide Wilderness: three subtypes of the boreal forest found at higher elevations in the Catskills (\\"mountain fir\\", \\"mountain spruce-fir\\" and \\"spruce-fir rocky summit\\"), hemlock-northern hardwood forest and beech-maple mesic forest northern hardwoods, such as sugar maple, beech and yellow birch, are the most predominant, with associate species such as black cherry, white ash, red maple, basswood, big-tooth aspen and red oak can be found at some locations. White pine and hemlock also carve out some groves of their own, particularly in areas closer to streams. Hobblebush and serviceberry are common shrubs at the higher elevations. Vascular plants to be found in the forest understorys include several fern varieties (predominantly woodfern and hay-scented), stinging nettle and jewelweed. trillium, wood sorrel, clintonia, bunchberry, starflower and foamflower round out the biome for the flowering plants. One ravine has been found to support a colony of nodding pogonia, an orchid that grows in only three other locations in New York. Animal life Mammals that favor forest habitat predominate within the Slide Wilderness. Among the 49 species known to exist there, black bears have done exceptionally well, as have snowshoe hare, gray squirrel and porcupine. White- tailed deer, who were successfully reintroduced into New York in 1887 via a protected habitat on lands now part of the wilderness area, winter here. Cottontail rabbit and beaver also maintain lower population levels. Fisher were reintroduced to the area in the late 1970s and have thrived in numbers significant enough to make life difficult for the porcupine, always abundant in the Catskills. Birds are an especially important component of the local ecosystem for historical reasons. Bicknell's thrush was first observed on the summit of Slide in 1881; today, after recently being declared a separate species from the gray-cheeked thrush, it is considered a threatened species and its summer breeding areas in the boreal forests important enough that in 1999, New York governor George Pataki augmented the wilderness status of the area with Bird Conservation Area status that applied to almost all the Catskill High Peaks. This protects not only the Bicknell's but other species such as the black-and-white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, Canada warbler, red-eyed vireo, Louisiana waterthrush, scarlet tanager and rose- breasted grosbeak, some of which require large unbroken forests to nest. More common birds observed in the area include ruffed grouse and wild turkey, the latter being common enough to be a game species in the springtime. In all, 98 species of birds are believed to make their home here. The streams of the Catskills, including those in this wilderness, are famous for their trout, and the brook, brown and rainbow varieties can be found here, although not in sufficient numbers to allow for intensive fishing. The 37 amphibian and reptile species found in the area include six deemed to be of special concern by the state: Jefferson salamander, blue-spotted salamander, spotted salamander, spotted turtle, wood turtle and eastern hognose snake. History While the wilderness area designation is rather recent, formally dating to the 1985 adoption of the Catskill State Land Master Plan, the area has been part of New York's constitutionally protected Forest Preserve for a century before that. Ironically, the lands around Slide Mountain were added to the original legislation not for conservation purposes, but to settle a tax debt Ulster County owed to the state. Management The SMWA, like all lands in the state's Forest Preserve, is managed by the Division of Lands and Forests within New York's Department of Environmental Conservation. DEC is the successor agency to the Conservation Department, Conservation Commission and Forest Commission, all of which managed the lands in prior eras. The forest rangers of DEC's Office of Public Protection provide law enforcement services to the unit. New York's wilderness-area management guidelines are similar to, if a bit looser than, those followed by the federal government. Any development of new facilities within the unit requires a change to the Unit Management Plan (UMP), or is added only at the UMP's periodic updates, both of which require public comment and extensive review. The UMP is itself governed not only by the state's Environmental Conservation Law but Article 14 of the state constitution, which requires that the Forest Preserve be kept \\"forever wild\\" and free for public use beyond any reasonable fee required for a particular activity. In a departure from the usual practice of most American public land management, the state pays full property taxes on the lands to all local governmental entities as if it were a commercial landowner. Recreational use Use of the land is limited to minimal-impact passive recreation such as hiking, camping, hunting and angling. No powered vehicles are allowed within (The use of chainsaws for trail maintenance is also permitted only by explicit written authority of the DEC commissioner). There are no designated equestrian trails within the wilderness. While mountain bike usage is currently a matter of debate as the CPSLMP is updated, and not specifically prohibited, it does not seem likely that it will be allowed. No structures may be erected on the land except those DEC creates within UMP guidelines. Tents are permitted; hunters' tree stands are not. there are 35.3 miles (56.8 km) of officially maintained and marked trails (more are planned). There are three lean-tos, and 29 officially designated campsites in the wilderness area. Outside of those, camping is not permitted within 150 feet (45.7 m) of any trail, road or stream. In areas above 3,500 feet (1,067 m) in elevation, it is only allowed between December 21 and March 21, when snow protects the ground. Open fires are forbidden above that location as well. It is the most popular of the four wilderness areas currently located within the Catskill Park. Access The state has built 10 separate parking lots along or near roads that abut the Slide wilderness, five of which serve as hiking trailheads. The sixth trail, the east end of the Burroughs Range Trail which traverses Wittenberg, Cornell and Slide Mountains, starts at the Woodland Valley State Campground, which adjoins the wilderness area. Similarly, camping is available at the southeast corner in the Peekamoose Valley Wild Forest, near the Bull Run trailhead. There is also a trail referred to as the Dutcher Step Trail that traverses the private property of the Winnisook Club. Anyone attempting to hike this trail should seek permission from the club first. The trail has some interesting views that the main trail does not. The club seems willing to allow hikers on a limited basis as long as you leave the trail as you found it and sign a release first.

During his playing career, Shearer predominantly played for Huddersfield Town, Swindon, Aberdeen and Inverness CT. He also captained the Scotland 'B' team and played seven times for the full Scotland national team. Since his retirement from playing, Shearer has had spells as assistant manager at Aberdeen and Inverness CT, as well as managing in the Highland League with Buckie Thistle. He is the brother of fellow former Clachnacuddin and English League player, Dave Shearer. He also played shinty as a youth. Playing career =Early years= Having had an unsuccessful trial with Partick Thistle as a teenager, Shearer began his career as a striker at Scottish Highland Football League club, Clachnacuddin F.C. in Inverness. While playing with Clach, the then-Aberdeen manager, Alex Ferguson, watched Shearer on several occasions and subsequently invited him to play in a reserve team match on a Wednesday evening at Pittodrie. However, early in the afternoon of the game, the Clachnacuddin chairman received a telephone call from Aberdeen to inform him that the reserve fixture that evening had been cancelled. The Chairman had to rush down to Inverness railway station and 'haul' Shearer off the train to Aberdeen. No further invitations for a trial at Aberdeen materialised at that time. However, later in his career, Shearer did get the opportunity to sign for the Dons. =Huddersfield Town= From Clachnacuddin, Shearer moved to Chelsea in 1983. He left at the end of the 1985‚Äì86 season after appearing in only two League games in his three-year spell at the London club, scoring one goal, although he stated he learned a lot during his time at Stamford Bridge. He signed for Second Division Huddersfield Town, scored a hat-trick in his first full game for the club (a 3‚Äì1 win against Barnsley) and was top goalscorer for 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì1988, whilst also being named the team's Player of the Year for 1987, and being including in the publication Huddersfield Town F.C. - The Fans' Favourites during the club's centenary in 2008. However, he was unable to prevent Huddersfield's relegation to the Third Division at the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season. Weeks before this, the unrelated English striker Alan Shearer (aged 17) had scored a hat-trick in the First Division for Southampton against Arsenal, a game which Arsenal captain Tony Adams missed through injury. In his autobiography 11 years later, Adams said that he had followed the progress of the game on Ceefax and mistakingly believed that the Shearer who scored the hat-trick was Duncan Shearer. =Swindon Town= He was approached by Lou Macari, who offered a club record fee of ¬£250,000 for Shearer to join Swindon in 1988, and fill the striker position following Dave Bamber and Jimmy Quinn exiting the Wiltshire club. In his first season, he was sidelined due to an injured foot and later a groin strain, but managed to score 14 goals in the 45 league games he took part in and was the club's top scorer for that season. In the 1989‚Äì90 season he scored 21 league goals for Swindon as well as the winning goal in the semi-final play-offs against Blackburn Rovers, and was part of the team that won promotion at Wembley ‚Äì only to be demoted due to financial irregularities at the club. In all he was top scorer for Swindon in every season he was at the club. He was Player of the Year in 1991 and was named in the PFA Team of the Year for Division Two. =Blackburn Rovers= In March 1992 Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for ¬£800,000. Despite scoring on his debut, he only played six games for Rovers under his boyhood hero, manager Kenny Dalglish, helping the club reach the playoffs where they were ultimately promoted, before he returned to Scotland at the end of the season, to be replaced at Rovers by his namesake Alan. Although officially signed due to an injury to Mike Newell (who coincidentally also later played for Aberdeen), it has been suggested that Rovers only purchased Shearer to weaken Swindon's team in their league battle. =Aberdeen= The powerfully-built forward signed for Aberdeen in 1992 for ¬£500,000, aged 29. After scoring twice on his debut he became popular with the fans and was nicknamed 'Deadly Dunc' for his strike-rate. He formed successful partnerships with other strikers such as Eoin Jess, Scott Booth and Billy Dodds during his time at Pittodrie. In November 1995, Shearer won the Scottish League Cup with the club, scoring the second goal in the 2‚Äì0 win over Dundee at Hampden Park. He had also appeared in the 1992 Scottish League Cup Final and the 1993 Scottish Cup Final, when the Dons were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Rangers on both occasions, and featured heavily in League campaigns in 1993 and 1994 which ended with runners-up finishes, again behind Rangers. Shearer made 152 league appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 55 goals. =Inverness CT= In 1997, at the age of 35, he returned to his native Highlands to join Inverness Caledonian Thistle, where he played for two-and-a-half seasons, making 55 league appearances and scoring 17 goals. International career During his time at Aberdeen, Shearer was capped seven times for Scotland between 1994 and 1995, scoring two goals including an important opening strike in an away win over Finland which helped the national side qualify for Euro 96, although Shearer did not make the squad for that tournament. The senior team was his first experience of international football, having never played at any age- group level. He achieved a childhood ambition when he played in the national team alongside John McGinlay, a childhood friend also from Fort William. Management career In season 1999‚Äì00 he began to concentrate more on coaching than playing, and was in the dugout when Caley Thistle famously beat Celtic 3‚Äì1 in the Scottish Cup. In 2000, he became assistant to then Inverness Caley Thistle manager Steve Paterson, following the departure of former assistant manager Alex Caldwell to Elgin City. He continued to be registered as a player (though seldom appeared in the squad) until the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season. In December 2002 both Paterson and Shearer left Inverness to take up management roles at Aberdeen. However, this did not prove to be a happy return to Pittodrie for Shearer, as Aberdeen struggled in the SPL and were put out of the Scottish Cup at the fourth-round stage by Livingston. Steve Paterson and Duncan Shearer left the club in 2004. Shearer was appointed as manager of Highland League side Buckie Thistle in October 2004. During his reign as manager, he won the Aberdeenshire Cup twice and the Aberdeenshire Shield once. He was sacked in April 2008, after a disappointing home defeat to Cove Rangers effectively ended Buckie's hopes of winning the Highland League championship. He then became a youth coach at Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Shearer and fellow coach, Scott Kellacher, were put in temporary charge of the first-team after manager Terry Butcher moved to Hibernian in November 2013. He released his autobiography in 2011.

She first appeared in 2003 with on-screen family, the Burtons, including twin sister Mel Burton, who was played by Powney's real life twin Cassie Powney. Storylines Sophie arrived in Hollyoaks in 2003 as the twin sister of Mel, along with their mother Liz and brother Justin. Sophie was the more outgoing twin (although she was sensible with it) and Mel often felt inferior to her. On her arrival, Sophie took on a beauty course at Hollyoaks Community College where her sister Mel already attended. Mel was unhappy as she felt Sophie would get more attention than her and always felt like the shadow of Sophie. Despite Sophie always trying to make her relationship better with her twin sister, Mel often made it hard. Most of the time, Sophie would be in-between her mother and Mel's arguments as Sophie would be the peacemaker. Frequently, Sophie supported and helped her siblings through their troubles, as Sophie herself never was involved in any nuisance. She was also supportive of her mother Liz's new partner Richard Taylor, despite Justin and Mel feeling uneasy at his arrival, Mel Burton fell in love with Michael Lane but he sadly left the village. Sophie began dating student Joe Spencer, but it didn't last for too long as she discovered that Joe was going to dump her and dumped him instead. Sophie also briefly dated Max Cunningham after initially going on a date with his friend O.B. who became Mel's boyfriend. Sophie became friends with Sam Owen who started to fancy Sophie, but unbeknown to her Sam had recently started date raping girls after prompting from his friend Andy Holt. During Christmas 2005, Andy targeted the Burton sisters as his next date rape victims. After getting himself an invite to the Burton house and spiking both girls' drinks with GHB, Andy offered an unconscious Sophie as a present to Sam. Although Sam was tempted due to his strong feelings he had for Sophie, he found himself unable to go through with the rape because he didn't want to hurt the girl he loved. Although Sophie escaped a sexual attack that night, Mel was raped by Andy. The next morning, when Sam and Andy had long since fled, Sophie and Mel recovered from the drowsiness of being drugged and pieced together what had happened to them. They both went to the police claiming to have been raped by Andy, although tests proved that Sophie had not undergone any sort of sexual abuse. The fact that Mel was raped when Sophie wasn't caused some friction between the sisters. Sophie turned to Sam for support and soon started falling for him. She began a relationship with Sam, unaware of his part of the rapes. After Andy's death, Sam had little choice but to confess his crime to Sophie because he loved her and wanted to run away with her. Sophie tricked Sam into turning himself in by saying she would stand by him until his release. As soon as Sam had come clean to the police, Sophie had her own confession for Sam when she told him she could never forgive him for letting Andy rape her sister Mel. Gradually Sophie managed to put Sam behind her and began to work at the newly opened salon Evissa as she was hired as an assistant for Sean Kennedy. She also found an unlikely friend in Russ Owen, Sam's brother, as the pair both had something in common, being betrayed by Sam. Things didn't get any better for Sophie as she was briefly sacked after false allegations made by Mercedes McQueen that Sophie had injured her during a treatment, but was later reinstated after Russ got photographic proof that she was faking it. From the moment Mercedes arrived in Hollyoaks she and Sophie were immediately enemies. Also Sophie, along with Mel, moved in with her friend Louise Summers after a brief spell of being homeless when Liz left Hollyoaks and sold the Burton house. Meanwhile, Sophie's feelings grew stronger for Russ and she eventually told him how she felt, but was left devastated when he told her that he was dating Mercedes. Things went from bad to worse as Sam escaped from prison, which again brought Russ and Sophie closer together. This time the pair ended up sleeping with one another and began to date, but Russ was secretly still seeing Mercedes. Sam had returned to the village and was told by his sister Nicole that his brother was dating Sophie. Sam then forced Nicole to tell him where Russ and Sophie were. She told him that they were at the local pub The Dog in The Pond - in fact only Sophie was there (with Mel and OB) as Russ was having sex with Mercedes. Sam headed to The Dog in The Pond and dramatically set fire to the pub. Sophie tried to escape but Sam tried to strangle her. Mel then jumped on Sam in an attempt to pull him off her.

Barbara Frietchie, The Frederick Girl is a play in four acts by Clyde Fitch and based on the heroine of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \\"Barbara Frietchie\\" (based on a real person: Barbara Fritchie). Fitch takes a good bit of artistic liberty and intertwines her story with that of his own grandparents' love story, which also takes place during the Civil War. Barbara Stanwyck took her film name from the name of the play, and a British actress named Joan Stanwyck who starred in one of the play's productions, perhaps in London. An illustrated version of the poem is contained in James Thurber's Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated. The play met with mixed reviews in 1899 because of the romance he added to the tale, but it would be successfully revived a number of times. Fritchie, a central figure in the history of Frederick, Maryland, has a stop in the town's walking tour at her home. When Winston Churchill passed through Frederick in 1943, he stopped at the house and recited the poem from memory. At 90 years of age she waved the Union flag out of her window despite opposition from Stonewall Jackson's troops, who were passing through Frederick. This event is the subject of the 1864 poem: :\\"Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, :But spare your country's flag,\\" she said. :A shade of sadness, a blush of shame, :Over the face of the leader came; :The nobler nature within him stirred :To life at that woman's deed and word; :\\"Who touches a hair of yon gray head :Dies like a dog!

The deposit's magnitude and significance led to the formation in 1949 of the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOCC). Geren led pre-production studies and became Manager of IOCC's operations at Schefferville, where he faced numerous challenges associated with building a large mining operation in isolated sub-Arctic conditions. Geren was born in Columbus, Ohio. His interest in mining originated in 1935 by a chance meeting with two geologists in northern Ontario. He earned his B.Sc. degree in geology from Ohio State University. Then he returned to Canada and started his career in the Timmins gold-mining area. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Afterwards he was employed by the Labrador Mining and Exploration Company. He received a mandate to confirm iron ore deposits of sufficient size in Labrador and northeastern Quebec to justify building a mine and railroad. More than 400 million tonnes were proven in the Knob Lake area in Labrador, which led to the creation of the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the construction of the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway (QNS & L) and the Town of Schefferville. Geren became the supervising geologist and chief mining engineer and then Mine Superintendent from 1954 to 1961. In 1961, he became Assistant Manager of IOCC. He became an Executive Vice-President of IOCC in 1976, a position he held until his retirement. During retirement, Geren and another former IOCC employee, Blake McCullogh, collaborated in writing a corporate history of the Iron Ore Company of Canada titled Cain's Legacy: The Building of Iron Ore Company of Canada (1990). In 1983, Geren was awarded the Inco Medal by the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (CIMM) in recognition of a \\"legacy of pioneering spirit and leadership that has help the iron ore industry weather economic difficulties and rekindle hope to meet the challenge for survival.\\" In 1984, Geren was invested as Officer of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour. In 2001 he was inducted into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame.

In 1955 several organisations, such as the airline KLM and aircraft manufacturer Fokker, initiated a foundation called \\"Stichting voor het Nationaal Luchtvaartmuseum\\" with the single goal of creating a national aviation museum. The first installment of this aviation museum opened its doors in 1960 at Schiphol airport under the name Aeroplanorama and had only seven aircraft on display. It closed its doors in 1967 and a new museum called Aviodome was opened in 1971 at Schiphol. The main building was a large aluminium geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller, the largest in the world at the time, which housed most of the aircraft on display. Hence the 'dome' in the name Aviodome. Over time, the location became too small for the growing aircraft collection and in 2003 the museum was moved to a new location on Lelystad Airport. The building at Schiphol was demolished and the name was changed to Aviodrome. On the current location, it has three buildings: the main building where most of the aircraft on display are located and where there's a restaurant and a cinema, a replica of the old Schiphol terminal building from 1928 and a hangar for aircraft storage with limited access for visitors. Added to the aviation theme were several artifacts from several Dutch space programs, such as the backup flight-article of ANS (Astronomical Netherlands Satellite), a mockup of IRAS and the high-speed windtunnel model of the Huygens probe. In doing so the aviation museum became an aerospace museum. Due to bankruptcy, the museum closed on 25 December 2011, but it reopened on 28 April 2012 after a takeover by the Lib√©ma Group. Collection =Aircraft collection= Note that not all aircraft listed are currently on display or even present at the museum.

Though the aircraft could still fly, Lelystad Airport was too small to handle such a large aircraft so the aircraft was partially disassembled and moved over water on a barge with the wings, engines and empennage removed and stored alongside the fuselage so the aircraft could fit under bridges along the way. After the journey over water that attracted a lot of attention the aircraft was lifted from the barge at Harderwijk and the last bit of the trip took place over land. At its final location the aircraft was re-assembled and opened to the public. The tail was fitted with a top beacon since, technically, the Boeing now is a building. = Connie's comeback = Perhaps one of the most spectacular pieces in the collection of the Aviodrome is the Lockheed L-749 Constellation, often just called Connie. After several years of restoration work it was flown over to the Netherlands in 2002 from the United States where it had been in storage. More work, including a new paint job, was done to the aircraft in the Netherlands but sadly the aircraft suffered from engine problems in 2004. To resolve this, two replacement engines coming from the Korean Air museum were fitted. However, it hasn't flown since 2004, performances by the aircraft being limited to engine runs only. = De Uiver = DC-2 - De Uiver De Uiver was the name of a Douglas DC-2 that placed second in the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race, only being beaten by a purpose built de Havilland DH.88 racer Grosvenor House. The real Uiver, which is an old Dutch word for Stork, no longer exists. The Aviodrome owns one of the last still airworthy DC-2s in the world. This DC-2 is a former US Navy aircraft painted in the Uiver's original KLM colors. After an unexpected gear collapse the aircraft suffered some minor damage, but after the needed funds were raised the aircraft was repaired. = Fokker Friendship = The Fokker F-27 Friendship was Fokker's best selling aircraft model of all time. Production of this first post-war Fokker airliner started in 1955 and many of them are still in service today. The Aviodrome purchased the oldest still flying series produced F-27 from its Australian owner in 2004 and painted it in the colors of the no longer existing Nederlandse Luchtvaart Maatschappij (NLM). Exactly fifty years after the first flight of the first F-27 on 24 November 1955 this aircraft made a memorial flight as a tribute to fifty years Fokker Friendship.

Storylines The archetypal moody teenager had to move in with her father‚Äôs partner Liz and her children. Darlene found it difficult and did not get along with Liz or her son Justin. Darlene refused to compromise and tried often enough to split her father and Liz's relationship up. No matter how hard Darlene tried, her plans backfired when her father and Liz wed and Darlene had to live with this. Things got worse when Justin found out his dad had committed suicide rather than had a heart attack like his mother had told him. This made Justin turn to drugs and Darlene was angry that Liz couldn't control him. However, Darlene faced the shock of her life on her 18th birthday when out of control Justin ended up pushing Darlene through a glass window. This left her with scars on her face that she found difficult to deal with and left her angry at Justin. Afterwards, Darlene never attended school or faced the outside world. However, with her father, Liz and her good friend Craig Dean supporting her, the pair both managed to arrange for Darlene to have plastic surgery for the scars on her face. After returning, Darlene had seen that Justin had changed after being sent into a boot camp and forgave him. However, things went from bad to worse for Darlene when both she and Ali were being bullied at school by racist thug Stephen Mackintosh. Macki was easier on Darlene as he found her attractive, but treated Ali horribly. It ended up in a tragedy when Ali stabbed Macki and later was run over by a car resulting in the deaths of both Ali and Macki. The blame for Macki‚Äôs death went on Justin and he faced a tough trial where Darlene‚Äôs testimony was to be crucial. Despite the fact that at first she blamed Justin for the death of her brother (as Macki used to be his friend, when he was on drugs), she eventually realised that Justin was innocent and decided to give evidence for him. She told the jury that Macki had bullied Ali so badly that it was possible that he could have reached a breaking point and fought back. Through those difficult times, she also lost her father who moved out of the house after Liz discovered that he had been having an affair. Instead of going with her father, she stayed with the Burtons and Liz. Justin and the twins made it clear they thought of Darlene as part of their family. She found comfort in the arms of Craig Dean but despite him falling for her, Darlene often manipulated him. After Liz deciding on moving to Colchester, Darlene moved in at The Dog in The Pond after convincing to Craig that Liz threw her out. She caused havoc in The Dog in The Pond after she tried to seduce Craig's stepbrother Darren Osborne but then told Craig it was Darren that was trying to seduce her. However, Darlene‚Äôs games soon backfired on her when she was tricked by Darren into sleeping with her as Craig walked in on them. Darlene tried to claim that Darren had raped her but a hurt Craig saw straight through it and told Darlene to leave. She continued to play her games, this time with Liz as she accused Jack Osborne on trying to come on to her. However, after Liz got the full story from Jack she decided no longer to put up with Darlene‚Äôs behaviour and wanted Darlene out of the house. Having burnt all her bridges, Darlene then decided the best thing to do was move in with her mum and depart Hollyoaks for good. Reception The Sunday Mercury described her as a \\"nasty teenager\\".

Frankie unfortunately suffered from a miscarriage early on in her pregnancy. Frankie found this difficult to accept and it took her some time to move on. The nadir was when the Dog on the Pond, the pub they owned, was destroyed in an explosion. Jack and Frankie were out for a meal when the pub exploded and Frankie and Jack nearly lost Darren, Steph, Craig, and Jake as they were trapped inside the pub when it exploded and caught fire. While they used insurance money to rebuild the pub, they stayed at a grimy bed and breakfast where the owner constantly treated them poorly. They were kicked out, and briefly lived with the McQueen family until finally Frankie could take no more and forced Jack to use the insurance money he had been pocketing to pay for a nice hotel until they could go back to their apartment. Frankie was very concerned with making sure Becca's newborn son (although they were unsure of the paternity, Jake lied to them and said he was the father) stayed with them while Becca was in prison. Becca eventually agreed, and when Becca was soon killed in a prison fight, Charlie came to live with Jake full-time. Frankie and Jack then went away for a while, and returned from holiday only for Frankie to receive the news daughter Debbie had been in a car crash. Frankie went off to look after her. After Jake confessed his love for Nancy, Frankie was disgusted about it. Nancy couldn't believe that she would put her prejudice before her own son. Frankie returned in 2007. John Paul McQueen John Paul referred to her as a homophobe after she told him he had already failed at turning her son Craig gay (at which point she was unaware that John Paul and Craig were secretly sleeping together). Jack was a little more supportive. When she discovered the truth about Craig's sexuality, she refused to believe he was gay and tried to convince Craig to try to get Sarah to forgive him and go to Dublin. When Craig came out to his family Frankie was disappointed, which hurt Craig. Frankie reluctantly accepted her son's relationship with John Paul. The day after Craig left for Dublin, she was shown drinking a glass of gin and reading his acceptance letter, smiling. To get over the loss of Craig, Frankie decided to take in a foster child. Their first attempt, a little girl named Daisy, ended quickly due to Darren's hostility towards her, but then they took in a moody 15-year-old emo boy named Newt. He got taken back into care after being accused of taking Frankie's jewellery. It was discovered that it really was Darren when Carmel was buying Christmas presents for her family and ended up buying Frankie's ring from a pawn shop. Frankie then borrowed the video from the pawn shop which showed Darren selling the jewellery. Whilst Frankie and Jack argued with Darren about it Warren and Louise walked into the pub where Warren revealed that Darren had bet with him and lost his fifty percent of The Dog In The Pond to Warren. This led Jack to suffer a heart attack. On 22 January 2008, Frankie was told that Charlie had an acute form of leukemia, Nancy and Jake pleaded with doctors to run tests to see if either of them were eligible to donate their bone marrow to Charlie. Later on doctors confirmed that he could not donate bone marrow as he was not Charlie's biological father, confirming that Justin Burton (who had an affair with Becca) was in fact Charlie's dad. Jake later confesses that when he took the DNA test last year, he threw away the results and without opening them. Frankie was hurt by this when she knew that Jake could've confided in her. When Nancy tried to find Justin, Jake protested and told her that Justin wasn't going to go anywhere near Charlie. Frankie slaps Jake in order to calm him and tells Nancy to find Justin. After Frankie and Nancy's past problems, since Charlie's cancer, Frankie and Nancy's relationship had become more of a friendship. Frankie is concerned when Jack borrows ¬£100,000 in cash from a loan shark to buy back Warren's share of the Dog. When Carl and Anthony, criminal friends of Warren's, raid the pub to demand the cash at gunpoint, Frankie stood up to them in defence of Jack and Newt, and the three escape from the incident unscathed after Warren and Mike Barnes come to the rescue. Frankie was protective of Jake after his split from Nancy, not knowing that Jake had tried to rape Nancy on their wedding night. When Nancy files for custody of Charlie, Frankie was furious, claiming that they were Charlie's real family. While Jack and Steph began to notice Jake's increasingly erratic behaviour, Frankie still stood at his side. She vented her anger at Nancy and Justin, who she blamed for trying to ruin Jake's life, especially after Nancy accused Jake of rape. When Steph came forward and revealed that she had walked in on Jake attempting to rape Nancy, Frankie began to blame her, telling her she was turning her back on her family, despite Jack, Steph and Newt trying to make her see reason. It wasn't until later at the hospital that Jake revealed that he did try and rape Nancy. Horrified that Jake could do this she finally sees her son for what he is. She left him alone to say goodbye to Charlie before taking him to the police. Jake later abducted Charlie and attempted to kill himself and Charlie by gassing them in a car in the woods. Frankie began to frantically search for her son. She later found Nancy with Charlie and demanded to know where Jake was, who Nancy had left in the car to die. At the car that Jake was in, Frankie discovered Jake was gone. She later admitted she was scared for him, knowing that he would try and kill himself again. Jake tried to blame his descent into madness on his father walking out on the family three years earlier; however, Frankie told him that \\"your father may have been a naive and reckless man; but, for all his faults, Johnno would never have done anything as bad as what you have done\\". Warren offered Darren ¬£100,000 to help with money problems if he framed Jake by putting Sean's wallet in Jake's room. Jake got convicted of killing Sean and Louise was released. Frankie didn't believe Jake had killed Sean and accused Louise of framing Jake. Shortly after Eli used Frankie's salon keys to get in to trash the place before writing on the walls DIE and RIP in red paint. The next day a thug entered with an iron bar before smashing all of the glasses and stealing money from the till. Frankie immediately assumed Louise had been behind it. On 27 May 2009, Frankie and Jack found out that Darren had taken a ¬£100,000 bribe from Warren Fox to get Jake to confess to Sean Kennedy's murder before gambling away the money, despite the family being in debt. Frankie and Jack disowned him for lying and gambling away the money before telling him he had been given enough chances. After this, an ashamed Darren stayed in his flat and rarely left, knowing everyone knew about the gambling, however Cindy Cunningham managed to get him a job at a charity event in Il Gnosh. In October 2009 Jake was released from the mental institute he had been in and had all charges against him dropped due to his mental state, Frankie struggled through and coped with Jake's return. However Jake's return brought back the feud with Frankie and Nancy leading to Frankie handing over Charlie to Nancy as Jake was not allowed near him. Frankie figures out that Gilly Roach is in love with Steph, however Gilly denies it and says that he loves Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh), his girlfriend. With encouragement from Frankie, Steph tells Gilly she loves him and they get together but the happiness is short lived when Steph finds she has cervical cancer. Frankie finds out from Steph's brother in law Tom Cunningham. Frankie then discovers that Newt's birth mother Shelley Newton, who returns for a job interview, along with her baby son Jensen Newton. Shelley returns from the interview and announces she's got a job in Scotland. She then asks Newt to come with her and Jensen; he accepts and the reunited family then relocate. Steph has a hysterectomy and struggles with the fact she will never have children of her own despite raising Tom. Steph and Gilly marry when Steph finds out her cancer is terminal. Frankie struggles to accept the fact her daughter will die before her. Steph saves Amy Barnes and her children during a fire and then decides she'd rather die of the fire than cancer. Frankie breaks down in Darren's arms when finding out the news, and contact her ex-husband Johnno and children Jake, Debbie and Craig of Steph's death and were devastated and cannot attend to the funeral. Frankie begins to blame Gilly for Steph's death and argues with him over the funeral plans and tells him that Steph was still in love with Max and that he would have saved her from the fire. After having Steph cremated; they sat to watch Steph's goodbye messages, however she had died before getting the chance to film one for Frankie. She gets deeply upset to the fact that Steph is dead, but still sets a table for her at Christmas. This left Jack very concerned for her well being.

She is overjoyed and shocked to find that there is an extra recording entitled \\"Mum\\" and Frankie listens to the goodbye message from her daughter. In January, the Osbornes have an intruder who Tom hits over the head, and it later revealed that the intruder is in fact Frankie's granddaughter. The father was Frankie‚Äôs son, born when she was 16, yet Frankie thought he had died.

He confesses what he said to Jack and Frankie and, whereas Jack is more comforting, Frankie is angry and she and Darren argue. During this argument, Darren accidentally shouts that Frankie doesn't know what it's like to know a child might die. He immediately realises what he has said but Frankie slaps him and goes to the hospital to see Nancy and the baby.

Frankie is furious and orders that Esther apologize to Elizabeth and is unwilling to listen to Esther's explanation. She is told by Ruby that Esther was in love with Maddie and believes this to be the reason Esther broke down at the memorial and does not believe Esther when she tells her that Ruby is lying.

Darren and Jack decide to fake Jack's death, which Jack reluctantly agreed to. A Hollyoaks spokesperson spoke to Digital Spy saying \\"Jack's at an all-time low and the finding of a dead body is too good an opportunity for him and Darren to pass up. They swap the dead man's identity with Jack's, forcing Jack to slope off into the night. Darren's then left with the formidable task of telling step-mum Frankie of the 'death'. As Darren's tangled web of lies continues to grow, he's left in an extremely tricky position when he learns that Kris and brother Malachy are searching for their father. It's only then that Darren discovers the true identity of the corpse. Will Darren be able to keep his cool, or will he crack under the pressure? It's only when Jack turns up at his own funeral that Darren realises that the situation has truly spiralled out of control\\".

Character creation and casting Darren was created by Hollyoaks producer Phil Redmond in 1996. He was created along with his father Jack Osborne and step-mother Celia; they arrived from America to join Darren's older sister Ruth, who was already living in the village. He moved back to America and later returned until the current time. Darren has been referred to as \\"one of the most popular and longest serving Hollyoaks characters\\". Auditions were held for the part of Darren with Adam Booth securing the part in 1996; his first appearance was on 18 November. Booth left Hollyoaks in 1997, so the role was recast in 1999 with Ashley Taylor Dawson. Other actors that auditioned while in the stages of recasting included fellow castmember Alex Carter who went on to secure the part of Lee Hunter, two years after auditioning for the part of Darren. While at the National Youth Theatre aged 17 Dawson joined the cast of Hollyoaks. He went on to secure the part of Darren following an audition. Dawson has said that his first day at Hollyoaks was \\"daunting\\". Dawson left in 2000 to pursue a pop career in the UK pop band allSTARS*. AllSTARS* split up and Dawson later re-joined Hollyoaks in August 2003. Dawson has said, regarding playing the role of Darren, \\"I love playing the bad lad. He's my alter ego\\". In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was \\"turning a bit into Ken Barlow\\" and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was \\"still learning\\" and did not take his role for granted. He stated, \\"I‚Äôm not ignorant enough to think I can just go off and be a Hollywood star! I‚Äôd like to take on some more challenges for Darren\\". Character development =Characterisation= Darren's personality has developed over the character's duration. At first, according to Dawson, Darren was \\"very manipulative\\" and willing to \\"do anything to get his own way\\". Dawson added that some of Darren's actions were \\"blatantly horrible\\" although he felt that this made Darren \\"such a fun character to play\\". Dawson also commented on Darren's \\"luck with girls\\"; Dawson felt that Darren \\"tends to take girls for granted\\" and is \\"out for all he can get\\". Dawson also called Darren \\"an opportunist\\" and a \\"male chauvinist pig\\". Darren's earlier appearance including his \\"customary string vests and bling\\" (2009). On the character's transformation Dawson told Digital Spy that when Darren was younger he was \\"just a horrible child and he had nothing nice to say about anyone\\" before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that it was nice to see a different side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as \\"everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him\\". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and \\"tries hard to be the father that he wants to be\\". He felt that Darren enjoyed being a father and that it made him feel \\"complete and like he has a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail\\". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, \\"It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up\\". Dawson added that Darren's difficult life has led him to mature and act like a \\"bit of a saint\\", but that Darren was still greatly misunderstood. E4's official Website described Darren in this way: \\"For a long time Darren found it easier making enemies than he did friends, what with his constant scheming and dangerous gambling habit ... Darren 2.0 is a reformed man though\\". Hollyoaks international broadcaster BBC America described the character as a \\"relentless schemer and ne'er-do-well\\". Darren has been described as the \\"village hunk\\", an \\"outcast\\", a \\"bad boy\\", a \\"twisted hunk\\", \\"heartless\\", \\"hapless\\" and \\"sly\\" by various media sources. Dawson stated that when he first auditioned he had \\"bumfluff\\" which he was asked to keep for the part. Darren's dress sense has gone undergone changes in recent years. He often wore string vests and gold jewellery but he later changed his style which became more mature. On his character's change in style and the reasons for it Dawson said the producers were right to make the changes and opined that Darren has \\"moved on now and grown up a bit\\". =Earlier storylines= One of Darren's earliest storylines saw him and friend Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) stand up to bully Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry). Darren becomes friends with Mark in an attempt to deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dawson commented on this saying, \\"Darren liked Mandy even before he went to America so he was gutted when he came back to discover she had started going out with Luke. And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted to get together with Mandy ... Luke has other things on his mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move\\". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who \\"gives him the green light\\". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being \\"heartless\\" they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a \\"flirty kind of friendship\\" although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship \\"develops\\". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get \\"revenge\\" on Mark. He said Mandy would either be \\"shocked and turn to Darren for support\\" or \\"feel guilty about what she's done\\" and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would \\"try to shrug it off\\" although \\"deep down, he cares for Mandy\\". Dawson felt that Darren should become a \\"hero\\" to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy. Darren becomes embroiled in a feud with Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde), and Scott sets fire to The Loft with Darren inside. Dawson said these scenes were some of his favourite because of the good scripts, and that he enjoyed working with Hyde. The scenes required a pyrotechnics specialist to come in and assist Dawson and Hyde through the scenes. While Darren is feuding with Scott he and Debbie Dean (Jodi Albert) have a brief relationship. Dawson said Darren's relationship with Debbie and feud with Scott were his \\"favourite\\" storylines as they were \\"more in-depth and show both sides of the character\\". Darren has a brief relationship with Steph Dean (Carley Stenson), with Stenson commenting that Steph \\"really loved him\\" even though he was a \\"dirty dog to her\\". =Gambling addiction= Darren begins gambling in 2008 and later his addiction causes him a great deal of trouble, leading him to steal from his family and ultimately losing everything. On his character's addiction, Dawson commented that Darren is initially on a \\"winning streak\\" but quickly begins to \\"lose everything, including Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister)\\". He felt that Darren is torn about his addiction because although he is aware of his problem he believes \\"his next big win is just around the corner\\". When talking to What's on TV about Darren's addiction, Dawson said it began slowly but spiralled out of control, thinking that gambling is easy after a few big wins. Eventually, Darren was willing to bet on everything, even \\"who's going to have toast for breakfast\\". Darren finally realises he has a problem when in spite of the fun, he loses everything as his debts increase. Darren begins counselling for his addiction but later plays a game of poker with Warren in which he loses his share of The Dog in the Pond. Dawson said this \\"devastated\\" Darren who can't convince Warren the poker game was \\"just a joke\\". Darren begins a \\"Bonnie and Clyde partnership\\" with Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) which producer Bryan Kirkwood described as \\"very funny\\". Jessica then leaves the village in a \\"dramatic twist\\", leaving Darren in more debt in the process. Dawson said that Darren's gambling addiction had been one of his highlights in the show and described the storyline as \\"fantastic\\". =Fake death scam= This storyline, which was announced June 2008, was initially billed as Darren's father, Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna), being \\"at an all-time low\\" before finding a dead body which is \\"too good an opportunity for him and Darren to pass up\\". They swap Eamon Fisher's (Derek Halligan) identity with Jack's, before Jack is forced to \\"slope off into the night\\". The storyline was compared to John Darwin faking his own death with the Daily Record commenting, \\"Clearly, the news stories about John Darwin and his canoe haven't reached Chester\\" while the Sunday Mercury commented that Darren's guilt was deserved \\"in shades of the current John 'dead canoeist' Darwin court case\\". After these comparisons Dawson confirmed that the storyline was planned ahead of the media coverage of the case, adding that he thought the storyline was \\"far fetched\\", adding that due to the storyline being a \\"sensitive\\" issue it was likely to cause controversy. Dawson explained that Darren initially thought faking Jack's death was a \\"brilliant idea\\" but put this down to lack of sleep and stress. Dawson commented that Darren and Jack are so desperate that \\"everything seemed easy\\", but added that they realise their actions were making the situation worse. Dawson felt that if Darren gets through the events without becoming bitter, twisted and cynical, then he could learn from his mistakes but \\"it could go the other way and he might blame everyone other than himself\\". Dawson commented that the fake death scam was his favourite time with the serial. =Relationships= Hannah and Suzanne Ashworth Emma Rigby (pictured) felt that Hannah married Darren for different reasons from Darren. Darren and Hannah (Emma Rigby) go on a weekend away to Denmark with a rock 'n' roll band where they drunkenly marry in a \\"shotgun\\" fashion. What's on TV announced the storyline in June 2009. About the beginning of the storyline, \\"Hannah has gone off the rails of late, but even she manages to outdo herself when she and Darren tie the knot after a particularly boozy night in Denmark\\". Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans \\"stunned\\" and described the pair as \\"odd\\". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that \\"Darren doesn‚Äôt suddenly fall in love with Hannah or vice-versa. It's just one of those mad, crazy things you do when you‚Äôve had far too many drinks and your life is in a bit of a mess. They both regret it. They get home and their friends and families are horrified ‚Äì especially Hannah's family\\". Rigby said Hannah had married Darren to try to fit in and impress people. She added that Hannah would never have gone out with Darren willingly, \\"not even under the influence\\". She felt Hannah stayed married to Darren to annoy her parents and to get attention. Darren begins scheming with Cindy to scam The Dog. Darren decides to stay married to try to get The Dog back, so proposes that they do not get their marriage annulled to Hannah. Dawson said, regarding his plan to scam Hannah, that \\"Hannah wants an annulment and so does Darren ‚Ä¶ at first. The cogs begin to turn in his twisted mind after Cindy points out that being married to Hannah could get him The Dog back. He plans to pretend he's falling in love with her and, motivated by money, tries to make her fall in love with him\\". Darren is stabbed while trying to save Hannah, which the Daily Star said \\"proves to Hannah she is the love of his [Darren's] life. We‚Äôll have to see if she‚Äôll make another go of it\\". Darren offers to leave Hollyoaks with Hannah but she rejects his offer and leaves Hollyoaks alone. E4 wrote, in regards to how the relationship affects Darren, that he \\"turned a corner after marrying Hannah Ashworth. Darren became a true friend to her and helped her through her eating disorders\\". Darren begins an affair with Hannah's mother, Suzanne (Suzanne Hall), whose son Rhys (Andrew Moss) is Darren's friend. The Daily Star announced this storyline on 23 May 2010. Suzanne is upset and \\"Darren is more than happy to give her a shoulder to cry on. But he soon can‚Äôt believe the mess he gets himself into with his mate's mum. He tries everything he can to put her off but Suzanne is not having any of it\\". Dawson explained the romance, saying, \\"They're both lonely and there's a bit of a thrill for Darren as she's an older woman. It's just a bit of fun for both of them\\". Darren supports Suzanne through her marital problems; they grow close and begin an affair, until Rhys exposes them. Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea), Suzanne's husband, throws her out of her home, forcing Darren to allow her to move in with him. Suzanne decides to leave Darren and move to Spain with Neville. When asked who Darren would choose between Suzanne and Cindy, Dawson said, \\"Cindy any time\\". In early 2011, Suzanne returns, and announces that she's pregnant with Darren's twins. She gives birth to twins before she moves in with Darren and girlfriend Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Nancy ends her relationship with Darren. In March, Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) returns and pays Suzanne to leave the village so she can have Darren to herself, which Suzanne accepts. Cindy Cunningham Stephanie Waring (pictured) felt that Darren and Cindy are \\"made for each other\\" but bring out the worst in each other. When Cindy moves back to Hollyoaks Village she and Darren soon begin a casual relationship. Darren and Cindy later begin to show genuine affection for each other by helping each other through difficult times in their lives. Dawson has said that Cindy was the most suitable for Darren out of his previous relationships. In an interview with What's on TV, when asked who Darren would choose out of Suzanne and Cindy, Dawson said, \\"Cindy any time. He'd really like to make a go of things with her\\". Dawson also commented on the relationship calling the relationship \\"interesting\\" because Cindy is Darren's \\"first port of call\\". Waring has said she felt Darren and Cindy are \\"one and the same - they're the same person with different body parts\\". She felt the pair are \\"made for each other\\" but when together are \\"destructive\\". Waring elaborated, saying that unlike Cindy and Tony, Darren and Cindy \\"bring out the worst in each other\\". She felt that if Cindy was with Darren, Darren \\"could be the love of her life\\", but felt Cindy would be sensible and choose the relationship best for her daughter's welfare. In a later storyline, Cindy announces her intentions to marry Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) and scam him, a scam Darren later joins. Darren marries Hannah Ashworth and he and Cindy plan to scam The Dog. Their intentions to scam their respective partners, Dawson said, indicates that the pair are \\"two sides of the same coin\\". He added that they are motivated by money which made Hannah and Tony \\"useful to them\\", and commented that he wouldn't be surprised if they worked together to get what they want from their partners. Although Darren begs her not to marry Tony, she goes ahead with the wedding, and Darren and Cindy later plan to scam Tony, which Dawson called \\"cold-hearted\\". He added that Darren wouldn't \\"have any problems with stabbing Tony in the back even now because Darren's that kind of guy\\". Pickard said, about the beginning of this storyline, \\"Cindy is with Darren and she's realised I‚Äôve got a bit of money. They‚Äôre scamming me!\\" Darren and Cindy begin sleeping together and are caught by Tony but do not continue to see each other. Cindy and Tony divorce; Cindy begins a relationship with Alistair Longford (Terence Harvey) and agrees to marry him. Darren proposes to Cindy on the day of her wedding but she declines stating she wants to give Holly a better life and more financial security which Alistair can give her. Cindy returns in 2011 after Alistair dies and attempts to rekindle her romance with Darren but fails. Dawson later admitted that Darren may still be tempted by Cindy before adding that Cindy is \\"shocked\\" that Darren \\"would go for anyone but her\\". Waring felt that the pair would always have a \\"spark between them\\" but any romance between them ends when Cindy discovers that Darren has become a father and is engaged to Nancy. She felt that Cindy \\"gets over it pretty quickly\\" but Cindy \\"has her moments with Darren\\" as Darren is \\"the only person who [Cindy] lets her guard down in front of. With everyone else, a big wall comes up and she doesn't let anybody else see that vulnerable side\\". Cindy begins helping Darren plan his wedding to girlfriend Nancy. Waring felt Cindy's feelings had been \\"reawakened\\" through this storyline, adding that they never \\"fully went away\\". Waring opined that Darren asking Cindy to help plan his wedding made her feel \\"needed and wanted\\". Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is \\"a little part of [Cindy] that thinks, 'Surely he's going to choose me?\\" Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks \\"that it should be her\\". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is \\"the worst possible thing she could have done, because she thinks it means something but Darren thinks otherwise\\". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy she will have to let him go leaves her \\"devastated\\". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says \\"that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it\\". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was \\"just sex\\", adding that \\"it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term\\". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy \\"Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had\\". Nancy Hayton Jessica Fox (pictured) originally thought the pairing would not be long term. Darren and Nancy begin a relationship when Darren, Nancy and Nancy's housemates begin online dating in December 2010. Darren is due to go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have \\"always sort of hated each other\\" as they are opposites, explaining that \\"She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!\\" He felt for the pair to begin a relationship is a \\"case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works\\". Dawson added that through the pair's \\"pompous ways\\" they have both been through \\"hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long\\". He commented that the pair have \\"never seen eye-to-eye, but I think that when they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that\\". E4 described the relationship this way: \\"She's chalk and he's definitely more than a bit cheesy, but there you have it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item! They‚Äôre the original odd-couple!\\" Dawson added that Darren is \\"totally in love with Nancy. Nancy has really calmed Darren down\\". Fox added, regarding the beginning of their relationship, \\"It was a relationship that came out of nowhere, but the writers and the audience were so charmed by Nancy and Darren together that it's kept going\\". When asked if they were surprised at being initially paired up Dawson said, \\"Yes, i was. The scene in which they got together was absolutely hilarious. Darren just looked up and there she was!\\" before Fox added \\"I never thought they were going to last, but we just went for it full throttle\\". Fox later explained that the pairing \\"was only ever intended to be quite a short-term thing\\". The pair become engaged after Darren proposes, although the proposal is accidental rather than planned. Dawson felt that it was too soon for Darren to consider marrying Nancy. Shortly after their engagement, Suzanne returns and announces she is expecting Darren's babies. Regarding Darren being the father of twin babies and if his relationship with Nancy would survive, Dawson felt the situation was too difficult for Nancy but for Darren it was fine. He felt that the story was \\"interesting\\" and hoped the pairing would survive as they have \\"something special\\". Darren and Nancy split up when he moves Suzanne and the babies into Nancy's flat. They resume their romance after Suzanne leaves and takes the children with her. Fox commented that the pair would make good parents but have \\"a lot of growing up to do themselves\\", before adding that she hoped \\"Nancy and Darren would stay together for a long time\\" as she enjoyed the pairing. Fox later added that she'd \\"love a big soap wedding\\". Dawson said, about the couple's future: \\"Darren might stray if Nancy continues to push him away, but I think he's more paranoid about her leaving him. He's been a good boy far too long - I want him to man up and get his head together\\". On 19 December 2011 it was announced that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It was announced that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was \\"never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it\\". She added that the wedding was a \\"long time coming\\" for the couple but there going to be \\"a few obstacles in the way\\", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in \\"true Darren style\\". Dawson felt that at this point in the relationship Darren is \\"besotted\\" with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had \\"been through the mill\\" but \\"for once in his life, Darren is happy\\". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: \\"He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that\\". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will \\"have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends\\". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up \\"upside-down in mud\\". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that \\"it could be the tackiest thing ever\\" but that it would be \\"hilarious\\". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is \\"incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks\\". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is \\"going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to\\". Dawson went on to add that \\"things don't go as he planned\\". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying \\"after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together\\". Dawson felt that the pair are the \\"perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order\\". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are \\"destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!\\" Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is \\"not good enough for Nancy\\" so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to \\"make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren\\". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that \\"everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair\\". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: \\"I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!\\" Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be \\"horrified\\" although she would \\"see that he has good intentions\\". Fox later said that Nancy \\"really wants to get married, have babies and be happy\\" with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother \\"just yet\\". Ashley Taylor Dawson (pictured) said that Darren becoming a father changed him. Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt \\"relief\\" that the wedding went ahead as he \\"often worried that Nancy is too good for him\\". Dawson commented that he thinks \\"the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman\\". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: \\"it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger\\". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: \\"he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future\\". =Fatherhood= Darren's ex-girlfriend, Suzanne, returns, pregnant by Darren with twins. Dawson said, \\"At first [Darren] doesn‚Äôt believe her and he thinks it's a wind- up. When she threatens to go back to Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids\\". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because he does not want to lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, \\"I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit\\". Dawson added that Darren does \\"step up to the mark\\" and \\"matures very quickly\\". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a \\"purpose in life\\" which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for \\"Father of the year\\". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne ¬£200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken. Reception Dawson was nominated for \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the 2004 British Soap Awards, for \\"Sexiest Male\\" and \\"Best Villain\\" at the 2005 Inside Soap Awards. and for \\"Funniest Performance\\" in 2007 at the Inside Soap Awards. In 2009, he was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" at the British Soap Awards, \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Funniest Performance\\" at the Inside Soap Awards. Dawson was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\", \\"Funniest Performance\\" and \\"Sexiest Male\\" in 2010 for his role as Darren at the Inside Soap Awards. Also in 2010, at the British Soap Awards, Dawson was nominated for the \\"Sexiest Male\\" award. In 2011 he received a nomination for \\"Sexiest Male\\" at the British Soap Awards. In 2012 Dawson was again nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" and for \\"Best On-Screen Partnership\\" at the British Soap Awards. In 2012 Dawson was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2012 TV Choice Awards. At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards Dawson was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Sexiest Male\\". In August 2017, Dawson was longlisted for Funniest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. He made the viewer-voted shortlist, but lost out to Dominic Brunt, who portrays Paddy Kirk in Emmerdale. Darren was listed in \\"The Top 100 Soap Hunks of All Time\\" by What's on TV. Dawson was 8th in the \\"Sexiest Soap Stars\\" MSN poll. An Inside Soap critic commented that Darren was initially a \\"freckly auburn-haired forgettable schoolboy\\" when played by Booth. They added that Booth's Darren is a \\"very distant recollection\\" while Dawson has \\"made the part his own in such a big way that we've decided to wipe the other one from history\\". His character was branded a \\"rat\\" and \\"dastardly\\" for splitting up Gina and Emily by the Daily Record. Upon Darren's 2003 return to Hollyoaks, the Sunday Mercury said he had become \\"even more of a pain in the neck\\". They later called the character \\"a really nasty piece of work\\" and when he stole from his father, they questioned if Jack would \\"see what he's really like\\". Inside Soaps Peter Griffiths referred to Darren as one of the serial's \\"reliable stalwarts\\", saying it was a \\"relief\\" when he appeared and added that Darren was one of the characters who can \\"be relied upon to deliver\\". He added that the \\"tried-and-tested\\" characters helped the show through its rough patches and that they should be given the storylines they deserved. Griffiths' colleague Sarah maintained that Darren was the only part of the show that held her interest. The Press and Journal described Darren's time on the soap, saying: \\"He languished in prison for helping his father fake his own death, has battled a crippling gambling addiction and has been known to steal people's girlfriends and break up relationships\\". Kris Green of Digital Spy responded negatively to Darren's marriage to Hannah, saying \\"I still have NO idea why the storyliners thought it was a good idea to marry them off\\". Green later said that Rigby's on-screen partnership with Jamie in Hollyoaks Later worked well and was \\"better than Hannah and Darren\\". Green later dubbed Darren and Suzanne \\"Suzarren\\" due to their dangerous liaison, while the affair was described as \\"sizzling\\" by the Daily Star. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury said Darren and Cindy's scheming make them a perfect match. Laws commented that Darren and Cindy's relationship is more about \\"making money out of others‚Äô misery\\" rather than romance, and sarcastically commented that the pair were \\"nice\\" after they decide to con Hannah and Tony. On Darren and Cindy's intention to scam Tony the Daily Star wrote: \\"Cindy and Darren are perfect for each other. They are both greedy money-grabbers and it isn‚Äôt long before they are looking for a way to fleece Tony for all they can get\\". MSN said the sexual chemistry between Darren and Cindy was undeniable after Cindy's return. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly questioned whether Darren could adjust to fatherhood, while What's on TV labelled him a \\"doting father\\". Once Nancy became pregnant again Claire Crick of All About Soap said \\"At last ‚Äì some good news in Hollyoaks for once! Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they‚Äôre going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we‚Äôve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that it works out for them this time\\". She said that \\"with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they‚Äôll make the perfect parents and we can‚Äôt wait to see them with a little one\\". Crick went on to say \\"while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember them? You could be forgiven for forgetting they even existed ‚Äì it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material\\". Virgin Media criticised the character's original dress sense stating \\"he might be male, but that doesn't mean Darren can escape the fashion police. He may have gone to prison once already, but with his chunky gold jewellery and sinister string vests, it won't be long before he is carted away in cuffs for his crimes against style\\". Fellow cast member Jessica Forrest who plays Leanne Holiday opined that the character's style was the best style of any character from the show but \\"back in the day... with the string vests and highlighted hair\\". Producer Bryan Kirkwood said that he thought Dawson was a \\"brilliant actor\\", and added, \\"Ashley's one of those people that can do comedy and pathos within the blink of an eye\\". Kirkwood said that \\"Darren's one of my favourite characters\\". Fellow producer Paul Marquess spoke positively of Dawson's performance in an interview with Digital Spy, stating, \\"I think Ashley Taylor Dawson, who plays Darren, is a really strong actor, and by the end of this year we'll see a very different side to his character\\". Co-star Kieron Richardson commented on Dawson's performance as Darren, calling Dawson one of the serial's \\"strongest actors\\", adding that Dawson compelled him to watch when he was on screen. Richardson added that Dawson \\"makes me laugh, he does comedy really well and he does vulnerability really well\\".

The character was introduced as a youngest brother of established character Steph Dean (Carley Stenson). Burnet has won and been nominated for several awards for this role. Burnet departed the role in September 2007Guy Burnet quits Hollyoaks and returned to the show on 3 September 2008 in a storyline which saw Craig secure a \\"sunset ending\\" with John Paul McQueen (James Sutton).News ¬ª Hollyoaks ¬ª Channel 4 He made another appearance after his departure in spin-off show Hollyoaks Later in November 2008. The character is regarded as one of Hollyoaks most iconic characters. Character development Craig Dean was not at first outlined as harbouring homosexual feelings or tendencies. The character was originally scripted as heterosexual, and actor Guy Burnet wanted to maintain this aspect of the character in his portrayal. He relayed, \\"The thing that I wanted more than anything was to convey confusion ‚Äì if Craig could go and sleep with John Paul and afterwards the audience can say 'hold on a minute ‚Äì maybe he's not gay'‚Ä¶ If I've provoked that question, then I've reached the goal I wanted to reach. If I'm confused, in turn Craig is confused and so is the audience ‚Äì that's the way I see it.\\" Burnet was at first against the writers decision to have Craig become romantically involved with another male character. \\"I'll always be completely honest,\\" he stated. \\"I'll always be real. The truth is that it was difficult to play. It was talked about for a long while and I felt uncomfortable with the idea because I didn't think it was justifiable. I thought 'how can you make a straight guy who's a bit of a cheeky chappy, loves the girls and has a sort of camp sense of humour, gay?'\\" Burnet stated that he sat down with the producers of the series. \\"It was sitting with Bryan and the other producers, discussing it and saying 'right, if we're going to do this, it's not a story about a character being gay, it's a story where we have to justify the guy's sexual confusion ‚Äì why is he like this? And the most important thing is that he still has the love for the woman in his life'\\". Burnet conveyed that he does not see Craig as gay or bisexual, and was adamant on the series not portraying Craig as either. \\"It was a love for this one person,\\" he cited, \\"which threw him.\\" Burnet detailed, \\"Craig was always a lonely character. He never had that many friends surrounding him, even during the times of Bombhead and Lee. These guys were in a different year to him. He was always a lone soldier.\\" Further elaborating on Craig and John Paul's connection, Burnet stated, \\"JP was not only a best friend but when he came out, it was a coming to terms moment for Craig ‚Äì asking himself 'perhaps these feelings are OK to have for JP and I don't want to lose him as a mate'. It's confusion but it's also a love story ‚Äì an obsession almost.\\" Burnet revealed that his main goal within acting is to provoke a reaction. \\"...and I don't just want to provoke a good reaction,\\" he noted. \\"I want to provoke a reaction that's hatred ‚Äì hate me, but hate the character. If I've achieved that, then that's great. Variation is fantastic.\\" He stated, \\"The thing about Craig ‚Äì whatever character you play is always going to be slightly similar to you. Whoever says that they're completely different is lying because it's your face, its your expression ‚Äì it is you.\\" He added, however, that the personality \\"might be completely different\\" and pointed out that personality- wise he is nothing like Craig. \\"There are a lot of parts that are similar, things that you draw from reality,\\" he noted. In regards to whether or not he became comfortable with portraying Craig's sexual attraction to John Paul, Burnet clarified: \\"Even towards the end, it was always difficult for me‚Ä¶ You've got to remember that the room is full of people and it's not so much that which bothers you, but you're sitting there and ‚Äì this isn't meant in a homophobic way ‚Äì I just didn't feel comfortable doing it. It literally would be a silent set, we'd do it and hopefully it was one take and it was out of the way. That's a genuine answer.\\" In late 2007, Burnet decided to leave the series, stating that he wanted to pursue other acting ventures. However, he agreed to return to the series in late 2008. \\"I‚Äôve had so much support from fans since I left the show, so it‚Äôs great to have the opportunity to reprise the storyline and give viewers a resolution to the Craig and John Paul story,\\" he revealed. In September 2012, Inside Soap named John Paul and Craig's exit as their number 1 happy ending, \\"This tentative, tremulous, tortured romance is still regarded by Hollyoaks fans as one of the show's greatest-ever storylines - if not the greatest. So fervently were viewers wishing for a happy ending for gay teenager John Paul and his no-I'm-not-gay-but-maybe-I-am friend Craig, the producer even promised a happy ending in advance. And so, as they flew off to Dublin together, they kissed in front of a holiday poster of a sunset. Aw!\\" Burnet's return was revealed on 10 June 2008. The exact date was revealed to be 2 September.http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/H/hollyoaks/video/spoilers/ Burnet cited his appreciation for the show giving him a unique character to portray, while maintaining the distinct difference between John Paul's sexuality and Craig's. \\"I really appreciate the freedom and the opportunities that they've given me to really make something different of this storyline, not just the conventional 'coming out' storyline ‚Äì it's been a sexual confusion storyline,\\" he stated. \\"For James, it's been a 'coming out' storyline but for me, I really didn't want to mimic that or mirror it any way. It's important to show something different, something original and they gave me the freedom to do that. I'll never forget that.\\" Storylines =2002‚Äì2007= Craig, the youngest member of the Dean family, arrives in Hollyoaks with his family, his parents, Johnno and Frankie, his brother, Jake, and sisters, Debbie and Steph. He uses his intelligence to manipulate Hollyoaks villagers and to pull a variety of scams. He falls for older girl Abby Davies, as she leads him on, making him believe that she fancies him. However, nothing happens in the relationship after Craig discovers that she is using him in order to make her ex-boyfriend, Lee Hunter, jealous. Craig is supportive when his sister, Steph, is attacked and is left with epilepsy by Toby Mills. Craig is there for his family when they need him, as they struggle through their debts. Craig‚Äôs love life improves when he falls for the charms of another older girl, Natalie Osborne, who manages to seduce him. But she wants to keep their relationship a secret and she uses him to lose her virginity. She then starts to lose interest in him, but is taught a lesson by Craig's sisters, Debbie and Steph, who have had an intense dislike for Natalie since she arrived. Natalie then leaves Hollyoaks and Craig behind. Craig is dealt another shock when his father leaves the family for a 19-year-old girl named Michelle, who he has gotten pregnant. The Deans later move into The Dog in the Pond pub, which is owned by Frankie's new boyfriend, Jack Osborne. Craig is shocked when Johnno returns to the village and tells his family that his girlfriend has left him for someone else, and that he realised how much he missed his family. Craig then finds out that Johnno is lying and that he has left his girlfriend and newborn son, Presley, after he decided that he did not want to be a father again at his age. Craig and his siblings are disgusted by his behaviour. Johnno tries to make amends, but in the end decides to leave Hollyoaks to marry his younger girlfriend after Craig and Jake tell him that his new son needs him more than they do. Craig starts a romantic relationship with Darlene Taylor. He supports her after her stepbrother, Justin Burton, pushes her through a window and later when her brother, Ali, is killed in a car accident. Meanwhile, Frankie and Jack marry and Darlene deals with her feelings by making up claims about his family making passes at her. This leads to her stepmother, Liz Burton, throwing her out of her house and Darlene living with the Dean/Osborne clan. Darlene starts flirting with Craig's stepbrother, Darren, and then tells Craig that Darren is the one seducing her. Craig then walks in on her having sex with Darren, an event Darren orchestrated to prove what type of person Darlene is to Craig. Craig end his relationship with Darlene. Craig hopes to escape Hollyoaks after completing his A-levels. He is offered a conditional place at Trinity College in Dublin, but after failing to get the right grades, he decides to repeat a year at Hollyoaks Comprehensive. Jake accidentally runs over Diane Valentine, causing her son, Sonny, to begin bullying Craig at school. John Paul McQueen saves Craig from being beaten up by Sonny and this leads to the two of them becoming friends. Craig begins dating Sarah Barnes and becomes friends with her two best friends, Hannah Ashworth and Nancy Hayton. Sarah ex-boyfriend, Rhys Ashworth, tries to interfere in Craig and Sarah's relationship, but Craig stands up to him. John Paul is dating Hannah, but then suddenly breaks up with her. When pushed for the reason why, John Paul claims he fancies someone else and Craig assumes it is Sarah. When Craig sees John Paul and Sarah being close, he lashes out at both of them and dumps Sarah. John Paul tells Craig he made up fancying Sarah as an excuse. Craig and John Paul's friendship gets back on track and they get back together with their girlfriends. At Hannah's 18th birthday party, Craig is furious when he catches a drunken Sarah kissing Rhys. John Paul tells Craig that Sarah is not good enough for him and emotionally confesses that he is in love with him. Afterwards, John Paul tells Craig he was just confused and Craig forgives him. Craig also forgives Sarah for the kiss. At a school dance-off competition, Craig and Sarah say \\"I love you\\" for the first time. Craig gets drunk and tells John Paul he is fine with him being gay and kisses him. Hannah sees the kiss and announces it to everyone. This leads to John Paul coming out to his family, friends, and classmates. Craig is furious with John Paul since by association people will think he is gay, too. During a five-a-side match, Craig repeatedly smashes into John Paul, eventually culminating in Craig beating John Paul up. John Paul punches Craig back and challenges anyone else who wants to fight him. Later on, Craig apologises, but John Paul tells them their friendship is over. After Craig defends John Paul to Sonny and tells him he does not mind him being gay, John Paul agrees to be friends again. Craig is not very fond of John Paul's new boyfriend, Spike and John Paul accuses Craig of being jealous. Craig asks John Paul if he has gotten over him and John Paul admits he is still in love with him. Craig tells John Paul that he cannot stop thinking about him, he kisses him and they sleep together. John Paul is over the moon that they had sex, but Craig gets up, calls John Paul a faggot, and rushes out of the house. Craig is distraught over what happened between him and John Paul and begins acting erratically. Craig violently grabs and kisses Sarah, who is completely disgusted by his behaviour. When confronted by John Paul, Craig denies anything happened between them. When Craig sees pictures from Sarah's modelling shoot, he is not happy since she is in suggestive poses with another man. Sarah tells him it is just part of the job, but Craig tells Sarah that he does not want her to be a model. Sarah refuses to give up her career and tells Craig she does not want a jealous boyfriend. Craig tries to work things out with John Paul, but he is frustrated that Craig keeps denying that they had sex. One day, Craig turns up at the McQueen house, kisses John Paul passionately, and sleeps with him again. This time Craig acknowledges what has happened between them and John Paul assumes Craig is going to come out. However, Craig tells him that he is not gay, not finishing with Sarah, and he wants to see John Paul on the side. John Paul tells Craig he cannot accept being used like that. Unfazed, Craig tells John Paul whether he likes it or not, they both know how it's going to end up: Craig will come knocking and John Paul will be there. Craig asks Sarah to move to Dublin with him and she accepts. One day, Craig slips away from a get-together with two of Sarah's modeling friends, Evan and Melissa, and goes to see John Paul. Craig tells John Paul that is in love with him. Craig and John Paul both agree to split up with their partners so they can be with each other. John Paul goes through with breaking up with Spike, but Craig makes up an excuse not to break up with Sarah. Sarah and Craig have a row and break up. John Paul wants him and Craig to go public with their relationship, but Craig is not ready. Craig gets back together with Sarah and they leave town for a holiday without telling John Paul. Craig and Sarah return a couple of weeks later and John Paul is extremely angry with Craig for running off without any notice. Craig apologises and their affair continues. Craig gets good A-level results, meaning he can go to Trinity. After Spike reveals he knows about the affair, he and Craig get into a fight at the Dog, which Sarah walks in on and demands to know what is going on. Backed into a corner, Craig impulsively asks Sarah to marry him and she accepts. To keep John Paul from finding out, Craig tells Sarah that their engagement needs to remain a secret until he gets her a ring. Everybody is worried about Hannah, who is suffering from anorexia. Sarah and Nancy both believe John Paul is to blame, but Craig does not. John Paul is deeply upset he is being blamed for Hannah's condition. To make him feel better, Craig gives John Paul a watch that belonged to his grandfather, inscribed with the words Love Always. John Paul reluctantly accepts that Craig is moving to Dublin with Sarah since Craig has assured him that they still have a future. Craig and John Paul are caught in bed by Sarah. Sarah informs Frankie about her and Craig's engagement and they arrange a party at the Dog. Craig is not happy when he learns about the party and that Sarah has bought her own engagement ring. When John Paul arrives at the party and finds out Craig is engaged to Sarah, he is furious. John Paul demands that Craig makes a choice‚Äî it's either him or Sarah. Craig is reluctant to make a choice so John Paul asks him who he cannot live without and Craig says \\"you\\" and kisses him. When Craig leaves the room, John Paul texts Sarah on Craig's phone asking her to come upstairs. Sarah comes upstairs and walks in on Craig and John Paul kissing. Craig tells a stunned Sarah it is not what she thinks, but she does not believe him. Sarah outs Craig to everybody by saying she caught him with John Paul. John Paul admits it was him who sent the text to Sarah and tries to get Craig to tell the truth about them, but Craig instead becomes enraged and John Paul is thrown out. Sarah demands to know why Craig would propose to her when he was sleeping with John Paul. When Craig does not answer her, Sarah physically attacks him. Craig tries to explain to his family, but they are all disappointed in him. Frankie even tells Craig he is no different from his father. Craig confronts John Paul over what he did, but John Paul says he has no sympathy for Craig. The next day, Craig and Sarah have a heart-to-heart and he apologises for how much he has hurt her. Sarah forgives him and says she still wants to be with him. Craig tells Sarah that while he does love her, he loves John Paul and wants to be with him. Craig goes to see John Paul, who refuses to see him since Nancy had told him that he and Sarah were getting back together. The Dean and the McQueen families have a face-off, which Craig and John Paul slip away from and admit their feelings for each other. The two announce their relationship to their family members, most of whom are not supportive. Craig and John Paul are happy to finally be a couple openly, but it is clear Craig still has a lot of insecurities. Craig asks John Paul to come to Dublin with him and John Paul happily accepts. Sarah is heartbroken when she learns that John Paul is moving with Craig and Craig comforts her by saying that in a way, he wishes he never met John Paul. Sarah tells Craig they can still get back together, but Craig turns her down again. Craig and John Paul share emotional goodbyes with their family. At the airport, Jake, who had been the least supportive of their relationship, arrives to make peace with Craig. John Paul overhears Craig tell Jake that he is not gay, prompting him to ask Craig to kiss him. When Craig cannot bring himself to do it, John Paul realises he cannot go to Dublin with him. Craig begs John Paul not leave and reminds him that he chose him over Sarah, but John Paul says he forced Craig to choose. John Paul tells Craig he loves him with all his heart, but he deserves better than to be with a man who cannot even display romantic affection towards him in public. John Paul ends their relationship and walks away. Craig is devastated and tries to go after John Paul, but then goes to board his flight. =Post-Exit= Craig is repeatedly mentioned after his exit. Jake taunts John Paul with the news that Craig is having fun and seeing girls. Frankie mentions that Craig will not come home for Christmas because he does not want to deal with John Paul.

Craig admits it was difficult for him to date in Dublin, because he could not stop thinking about John Paul. Things become awkward when Darren mentions that John Paul is engaged to Kieron Hobbs. Craig emotionally confesses to John Paul that he is still in love with him and wants him back. John Paul admits he still in love with Craig and the pair sleep together. John Paul tells Craig he is and will always be the one for him and he is going to finish with Kieron.

John Paul and Craig happily board the train together. =Hollyoaks Later= In 24 November 2008, Craig met up with his sister Steph and Tom Cunningham in Scotland for a holiday at a remote cottage. Craig later reveals that this is because John Paul needed time to himself after going out on late night benders following the death of his sister Tina and his fianc√© Kieron. Upon arriving Steph and Craig are shocked to discover the cottage is owned by a man called Pete who is a nudist. After helping them settle in Pete leaves Craig and Steph to have a good holiday. Niall, having found the address of the cottage on Steph's laptop, has also arrived in Scotland to seek out Steph to try to make things up to her. He then puts himself up in a barn across from the cottage so that he can spy on Steph and Tom. When Craig goes out for the afternoon Niall approaches the cottage and breaks in putting Steph on edge; after hearing someone else coming, Niall escapes the cottage, injuring himself in the process. Later the same day, Steph and Craig take Tom to play football in the fields and Tom comes across the barn where Niall has been staying. Niall, thinking he has got his opportunity to meet Steph, prepares to make an appearance when he is shocked to discover that Craig is also present. He then puts his plans on hold. Later that evening Craig once again goes out with Pete the owner of the cottage, who also reveals himself to be gay, but Craig says that he is only in love with one bloke John Paul. While the pair chat Niall sneaks into the bedroom where Tom Cunningham is sleeping and he persuades Tom that Craig sent him, making the youngster follow him off into the night. The following day Steph and Craig are distraught that Tom is missing, but Niall lets their fear build and then makes contact with the pair. He then gives them a deal: if Steph meets with him then he will return Tom safely, but Niall's plan goes wrong and Tom escapes. Angry that he has been tricked by a child, he sets out to find Steph himself, and arrives back at the cottage where Tom has found Craig. Niall surprises the pair and ties Craig up and locks Tom in another room. Steph then returns and is shocked to be face to face with Niall. They then talk to each other with Niall desperate for her to love him. Steph then goes along with his plans for them to play happy families, despite her brother and Tom being locked away. Niall then goes upstairs to talk to Tom about how he would feel if he and Steph become his parents and then they can move away and be a happy family. Tom, however, chooses to live with Steph and Mandy Richardson. Niall, feeling rejected by Tom, leaves him and Craig locked up in the cottage and takes Steph away to the barn where he has been staying. At the barn he sets up a meal for them and the pair talk about Niall's behaviour and the hurt that he has caused, mentioning things like Niall running down and killing Max Cunningham, the church explosion, the death of Tina and murdering Kieron Hobbs. Niall manages to convince Steph that he's willing to change, but Steph claims she needs the toilet and Niall shows her through to another section of the barn. While in the other room Steph uses her mobile phone to call the police, but she is cut off when Niall suddenly appears behind her and crushes it. Back at the cottage, Pete arrives back to check on things and discovers Craig tied up. He frees him and then they go and check on Tom. Craig then asks Tom where Niall took him the previous day, believing Niall will have taken Steph to the same place, but Tom is not sure. In the barn Niall ties up Steph and tells her that he feels betrayed by her, but she knocks him out and manages to escape into the fields. Niall then gives chase and screams after Steph; Craig, who has been looking for her, hears Niall shouting and follows them. Niall traps Steph on a cliff edge and she warns him not to come any closer. He then tries to take their lives by throwing himself and Steph over the edge off the cliff. Craig then appears and tells Niall that Steph does not love him and to let her go. Niall then beats Craig in a bloody mess while Steph watches helpless. Craig then tells Niall to look at Steph who is scared by him and his behaviour. Niall then asks Steph if this is true and she confirms it. Angry and alone, Niall throws Craig into Steph's arms, kisses her briefly and then rips off the necklace he got her and walks to the edge of the cliff. Steph helps Craig up and then hears Niall say \\"Goodbye, Steph\\" just before he steps backward over the edge, jumping off the cliff, falling onto a pile of rocks below, ultimately leading to his death. Steph watches helplessly as Niall lies motionless below; Craig holds her pulling her away from the edge and Niall's body. On 28 November, the day after Niall dies, Craig returns to Hollyoaks with Steph and Tom. Steph is worried about what people will say regarding Niall and that she might be blamed by the McQueens for his death. Craig offers Steph the chance to go with him back to Dublin, bringing Tom along. Steph declines the offer and Craig leaves Hollyoaks to return to Dublin with John Paul. =Off-screen= In 2010, Steph dies tragically in a fire. Craig did not attend the funeral, along with his siblings and his father. In 2012, John Paul is seen at a bus station in Dublin chasing a bus which Craig is on. It is later explained that they have split up and Craig has left. Craig and John Paul had been having problems and they decided to have a child through a surrogate to fix them. However, Craig left before the child was born and John Paul is left to bring up their son (John Paul's biological son), Matthew. Matthew's surrogate mother, Chloe, informs John Paul that Craig is seeing someone else- a woman. In 2017, Craig rings John Paul who is on a plane to Singapore. Following Frankie's death from a stroke, it is mentioned Craig cannot attend her funeral, because he is in Singapore, meaning he and John Paul have gotten back together. John Paul returns to the village in 2019, and reveals that he and Craig have split up again, and that Craig has moved on with a new partner. Impact Craig Dean is considered one of Hollyoaks' most iconic characters. In response to the fan mail the character receives, Burnet stated, \\"I've had a lot of fan mail and I haven't replied to all of them and I'm really sorry. But I promise I really will reply to everyone.\\" He further revealed, \\"There was a point where I was completely focused on the storyline and I didn't go and collect the mail for a period of time. I managed to send off about 200 or so letters. But everyone who did send me letters, I've read them all and I really appreciate all the words. In time, I will write back to everyone. More than anything, they are the most important thing to me. Fan appreciation is great ‚Äì I even appreciate if they don't like Craig, hate him even.\\" Burnet added that he was \\"genuinely overwhelmed\\" by all of the attention. \\"I'm not from an acting background,\\" he stated, \\"and for three or four years I was perhaps in the background and a lot of fans probably didn't recognise I was there. That was fine for me but I wanted to prove my worth.\\" Burnet's pairing with actor James Sutton, as Craig and John Paul, has also been successful, winning several LGBT awards. \\"The gay community likes the story in some ways and I love that,\\" cited Burnet. \\"In some ways, I sympathise with a lot of people who have come out and it's been difficult for them. I hope that I've justified it not just for them but for people in different positions, people in positions of sexual confusion. It's for them that I hope they've enjoyed the story.\\" See also *John Paul McQueen and Craig Dean  References   External links  * Character profile at E4.com * Character profile on the Hollyoaks website * Character profile at Hollyoaks.com * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Hollyoaks characters Fictional LGBT characters in television Television characters introduced in 2002 Dean family Male characters in television ","title":"Craig Dean"},{"id":"3501784","text":"Jacob Gilles Jacob Gilles (ca. 1691 in Kollum - September 10, 1765 in Ypenburg manor near Rijswijk) was Grand Pensionary of Holland from September 23, 1746 to June 18, 1749. 18th-century Dutch people 1691 births 1765 deaths Dutch States Party politicians Grand Pensionaries People from Kollumerland ","title":"Jacob Gilles"},{"id":"3501788","text":"Vacherie is an unincorporated community in St. James Parish, Louisiana, United States.

Sacre portrayed the character between 2002 and 2008, before making a return on 5 October 2009. In March 2010, Sacre was axed from the series by Paul Marquess during his major revamp and cast cull. Jake made his last appearance on 6 August 2010. Character creation In late-mid 2002, it was announced that regular character Steph Dean's family would appear on the series. Max Brown who secured the role of Kristian Hargreaves, originally auditioned for the role of Jake. However actor Kevin Sacre was the successful applicant. Jake and his onscreen brother Craig Dean (Guy Burnett) were introduced as two of four new male characters introduced in late 2002. In early 2010 it was announced that Lucy Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer, Paul Marquess then took over the role. It was soon revealed that he planned revamp Hollyoaks, changing the productions team, then began a cast cull starting with the axing of three established characters. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their characters would be next to depart from the series, stating that there was a general feeling on unease. One month later the cast cull continued as Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, during this it was revealed that Jake would leave the Hollyoaks once more at the end of Scare's current contract. He is set to finish filming in early 2010 and depart on-screen after the conclusion of a story about his unbalanced love-interest Loretta Jones (Melissa Walton). Character development The first signs of Jake's nasty personality started after discovering wife Becca Dean had been having an affair with former school pupil Justin Burton. Becoming aggressive and manipulative, Jake beat up Justin several times and, on one occasion, physically attacked pregnant Becca. After being rushed to hospital, Charlie was diagnosed with leukaemia. Jake offered himself as a donor, being Charlie's father, however doctors informed Jake and Nancy that Jake was not Charlie's biological father, and therefore must have been conceived during Becca's affair with Justin. Jake was furious but refused to admit Justin was Charlie's father. Jake grew more out of hand and even more controlling of Nancy. On their wedding night, Jake wanted to have sex with her, however she did not. Steph entered the flat, stopping Jake before he got out of hand and raped her. Nancy and Jake split up and she told him she was filing for full custody of Charlie. Jake began a vendetta against her in order to make her look bad. Jake ended up kidnapping Charlie and attempted to kill himself and Charlie. Domestic abuse charity Tender praised the soap opera's portrayal of Jake attempting to rape Nancy. A survey conducted by the group found that 96% of participants thought the scenes were effective in bringing the issue to viewers' attention. Discussing the reasons behind the attempted rape, 68% thought Jake craved control, while 30% put his actions down to mental instability and 1% blamed abuse suffered when he was young. The poll also revealed that 54% of respondents thought Jake should receive counselling and 45% felt he should serve time in prison. Tender stated, \\"As a national platform, Hollyoaks played a vital role in educating the public about the issue of abusive relationships.\\" On 11 April 2008, Kevin Sacre announced his departure on the Hollyoaks website, and confirming he has filmed his final scenes. When quizzed over his decision, Sacre said, \\"I have been here since I was 24 and I turned 30 in March. I decided that once I turned 30 I'd go and explore other avenues. We have a lot of good actors on the show and it's good to see them go on to do great things because people are always saying that Hollyoaks actors are rubbish, which is so unfair and untrue. I'd love to go and do something and people say 'oh look there's Kev, he's doing well and he's one of our lot.\\" In July 2009, it was reported by entertainment website Digital Spy that Kevin Sacre had agreed to return to Hollyoaks briefly later on in the year. The Channel 4 official website confirmed the characters return in October. On the character's arrival, he appeared to have changed and his mental health had improved greatly. This led to the announcement of his release. Storylines =2002‚Äì2008= Jake arrives in Hollyoaks with his family. The eldest of the Dean family, Jake soon begins a short relationship with Jodie Nash.

Loretta tells Jake she once suffered from leukemia in order to gain attention but when he finds out shes lying he kicks her out. Loretta manages to convince Steph and Frankie that Jake has been threatening her and she is afraid of him. Jake feels he has no choice but to stay with Loretta or his family will have him sectioned again. He confides in Nancy, who privately meets Adam to confirm Jake's story.

Jake hears that Kris Fisher and Zak Ramsey are going to London to help Zoe Carpenter organise a rich person's birthday party and he shows an interest in going with them, but Kris says it wouldn't be his sort of thing.

Zak and Kris meet at the Loft, with the bags they're taking with them to London, when Steph and Jake manage to find them.

Following Frankie's death in 2017, Jake's niece Esther contacted him, Debbie and Craig to break the news. She later explained that Jake and Debbie intended to attend the funeral but missed their flights. Reception Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture criticised Jake's 2009 return branding it as unsuccessful, also stating: \\"Sometimes a returning character can bring a much needed shot in the arm to a soap [...] but that‚Äôs because those characters were liked in the first place. [...] So far, the only point of Jake‚Äôs return has seemed to be to show us that being in a psychiatric ward isn‚Äôt the permanent sentence Hollyoaks would have previously had us believe.\\" References External links * Character profile on the E4.com * Character profile at Hollyoaks.com Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2002 Male characters in television Dean family Male villains ","title":"Jake Dean"},{"id":"3501810","text":"Becca Dean (also Hayton) is a fictional character from the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Ali Bastian. She first appeared on-screen on 19 September 2001 and departed on 16 February 2007. Storylines Becca arrived as an undergraduate in 2001. She was a na√Øve fresher who forged a relationship with fellow student Jamie Nash (Stefan Booth). The pair started dating, but he was a love rat who two-timed her with her best friend. When Becca found out about his infidelity, she dumped him but despite this; Becca always saw a different side to Jamie and shortly they got back together, but it didn't last. He was killed in the minibus accident on a potholing trip, which also killed Theo Sankofa (Andrew Somerville). Around the same time, Becca discovered she was pregnant with Jamie's baby. Feeling she was not ready to be a parent, Becca had an abortion against the advice of Jamie's sister, Jodie. She later embarked on a relationship with Alex Bell (Martino Lazzeri) but things were complicated. Alex had a strained relationship with Anna Green (Lisa M. Kay), the mother of his son, Charlie. Alex used Becca to make Anna jealous which worked as Anna blamed Becca for the tension between herself and Alex. Sadly, for Becca this relationship ended when Alex decided to take a job in Hong Kong. Her next relationship was with Adam Morgan, who was recovering from the car accident caused by Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn) that landed him in a wheelchair. Becca provided unlimited support through Adam's time of need. Becca was distraught when Adam accepted a place at a film school in New York. She begged him to stay, but her pleas were all in vain, as Adam went anyway. At one point, Becca even enjoyed a brief liaison with local firefighter Ben Davies (Marcus Patric), the best friend of her future husband Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Becca and Jake have experienced tension in their relationship; most recently, after Jake found out she had been visiting ex- student Justin Burton (Chris Fountain), who had an unrequited crush on her, in prison and most notably when Jake had an affair with Lisa Hunter (Gemma Atkinson) that resulted in him passing on an STD. Although the affair ended when Jake realised he was madly in love with Becca, the guilt proved too much and his first marriage proposal became a confession. The two broke up but Jake was determined to win Becca back and did so with a knight in shining armour style proposal in the village. The two married although Becca still feared she was making a mistake up until she said 'I do'. The marriage suffered problems almost immediately, as Becca feared she had made a mistake and Jake's possessive behaviour increased when she visited her pupil Justin in prison after being pressurized by his sisters. Jake also had money troubles following his parents‚Äô disastrous mortgage, felt he had let Becca down, while Becca felt her marriage was a mistake, and felt trapped and alone. Becca made a best friend in Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). On Christmas Eve 2005 she went to Justin's house and admitted she was jealous when she thought she found out he had slept with Nicole Owen (Ciara Janson) and this led to a passionate kiss. The next day she went back after spending most of Christmas Day playing happy families with the Deans. They slept together and she later told him it was a mistake even though it was obvious she still had feelings for him. Becca told Jake that it would be a good idea for them to start a family together, which she would later regret as having children with Jake became the last thing on her mind. She told Mandy she had an affair with a teenager, Mandy later found out the identity of her teenage lover. When Justin told her he was leaving, she begged him to stay. She later claimed this was from an academic viewpoint only. The affair with Justin started up again on Valentine's Day, leading her to be torn between two men who both loved her desperately but in different ways. The shock news of her beloved father's death left her feeling more confused and distraught than ever. Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) was very angry with Becca because she went to see Mr. Hayton before he died, when in fact, Becca had intended to go to see Mr. Hayton so that she could spend a weekend with Justin, which she later regretted. Becca fell pregnant and did not know who the father was. Viewers witnessed Jake's violent streak, having raised a fist to Becca (and attacking Justin) after learning of her affair. Becca then slept with Justin again, then later attempted suicide before admitting her love for him. She decided to keep the child and raise it with Justin, who moved in with her - a decision that angered Nancy when she was not consulted first. She lost her job as a teacher after the school became aware of her relationship with Justin, and for a short while she and Justin struggled financially living off his child benefit and wages from his job at Il Gnosh. They were briefly engaged (Justin having proposed with a ring bought with Becca's credit card) until Becca finally got tired of his immaturity and ended their relationship, kicking him out of the flat. Enraged by Becca dumping him, Justin went to the police and made false statements accusing Becca of child grooming, being a sexual predator and statutory child rape. He claimed that Becca had pursued him for months and forced him to have sex with her when he was only fifteen years old. If found guilty, Becca could have received 14 years penal servitude and consequently could have been forced to have her child put up for adoption. However, she received a custodial sentence of two years. She went into labour as the verdict was announced and gave birth to a boy named Charlie Dean (Joshua McConville). When Jake came to see Becca in prison, they agreed that Jake would care for Charlie until she was released from prison. However, at the end of the visiting session, she could not part with her newborn son and took Charlie with her to grow up in prison. As she walked off after abusing their agreement, Jake was left distraught and furious that the baby that he believed to be his son had been taken away from him. He didn't want his supposed son to be brought up in prison or put up for adoption. He thought it would be best for Becca to let Jake look after him. Even though Becca didn't want to be parted from her son, she knew that prison is no place for a baby to grow up. She decided to give the baby to Jake. On Jake's next visit to prison, Becca was angry with Jake for letting her child be kidnapped. Eventually Becca and Jake agree they want to be a family again, when Becca comes out of prison. In prison, Becca made friends with Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper). When Jacqui was released, she went after Justin and convinced him to drop the charges. During a drunken night at the Loft, Justin admitted to Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) how Becca had been falsely imprisoned, based on his evidence. A disgusted Warren ordered Justin to inform the police. Justin then went to visit Becca in prison and made a promise to tell the truth in an effort to secure her release. Whilst awaiting the decision about her release, Becca got into a fight with her cellmate, Fran, who stabbed Becca in the stomach after a scuffle. She was rushed to hospital with Jake and Nancy by her side. Before she died, Becca made Nancy promise she would sit her A-Levels and Jake told Becca he loved and forgave her, as she told him that she loved him more than Justin. Becca died of internal bleeding on February 14, 2007, her time of death being recorded as 11:45am. Justin was held responsible for Becca's death by many of Hollyoaks' residents. It is mentioned later that Fran has begun serving a life sentence for Becca's murder. In June 2009, Justin says goodbye to Becca and his sisters at the graveyard, before leaving Hollyoaks. In July 2018, a student of Nancy's, Brooke Hathaway (Talia Grant), reveals to her that her mother is Fran. She explains that Fran is dying and wants to apologise to Nancy for Becca's murder. When Brooke and Nancy visit her, Fran explains how Brooke is autistic and how she is remorseful for killing Becca. Nancy tells Fran that Becca would want her to forgive her so she does. Fran, happy at being forgiven, passes away immediately afterwards. Reception Virgin Media profiled some of Hollyoaks' \\"hottest females\\" in their opinion, of Becca they stated: \\"Becca was every schoolboy's dream, especially when she had actual shenanigans with one of her students, Justin. Unfortunately, we won't be seeing any more of this mega babe as she suffered an untimely demise in prison.\\" A writer for Women Republic said that Becca was one of Hollyoaks' top five characters. Profiling Becca's various relationships Virgin Media state: \\"Becca gained sympathy when Jake did the dirty on her.\\" They also brand her affair with Justin as \\"impetuous and selfish\\" and that it \\"lost her several mates, her career and pretty much everything else.\\" References * External links * Character profile at Hollyoaks.com * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database * Character profiles on the BBC America website Television characters introduced in 2001 Hollyoaks characters Fictional schoolteachers Dean family Female characters in television Fictional prisoners and detainees ","title":"Becca Hayton"},{"id":"3501813","text":"Hoyt is a small unincorporated community in Morgan County, Colorado, United States.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 8 March 2000. Steph was introduced into the serial by executive producer Jo Hallows. In 2009 Stenson decided to quit, but the then producer Lucy Allan convinced her to stay to play out a dramatic storyline. The announcement of her departure was made public in June 2010. Stenson's fellow cast members have described her as a \\"Hollyoaks legend\\" because of her lengthy duration. Steph has been described as having a highly confident persona, a trait Stenson enjoyed portraying throughout. Steph is also played as \\"fame hungry\\". She is noted for a number of high-profile storylines such as the portrayal of bullying in a school environment, the portrayal of epilepsy, which Stenson felt had been a 'taboo subject' for too long. Other stories include becoming a widow and her involvement in Niall Rafferty's revenge plot and her constant desire for fame. One of Steph's final storylines was the portrayal of cervical cancer, which Stenson conducted extensive research into. Steph was subsequently killed off in a special block of episodes branded by the media as \\"fire week\\". Some critics described her final storylines as \\"upsetting\\" and \\"surprising\\". Steph's relationship with Gilly Roach, played by Anthony Quinlan was viewed unfavourable by most. Stenson has been nominated for several different awards for her portrayal of Steph. Storylines =Backstory= Steph is the daughter of Frankie (Helen Pearson) and Johnno Dean (Colin Wells). She has two brothers, Craig (Guy Burnett) and Jake (Kevin Sacre), and a sister, Debbie (Jodi Albert). She is not close to her siblings, and has a strained relationship with her mother, who prefers to involve herself in Craig and Jake's lives and boast about Debbie's professional singing prowess. In contrast, Steph has a very close relationship with her father, Johnno. =2000‚Äì2011= Steph is introduced as a new student at Hollyoaks High, with early storylines focusing on her school life and best friend Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). She frequently bullies fellow pupil Lisa Hunter (Gemma Atkinson), driving her to attempt suicide. When Steph's friends react disapprovingly, she apologises and promises to change. She cultivates a promiscuous reputation, having brief relationships with Brian and footballer Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Steph eventually becomes friends with Lisa, but accidentally ruins her hair while attempting to dye it. Believing that she did so on purpose, her other friends shun her. Distracted by the quarrel, Steph does not notice that she is being stalked by serial killer Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). He attacks her, hitting her in the head with a spanner and leaving her to die. Steph is comatose for a week, and is diagnosed with epilepsy when she regains consciousness. Upon learning that Toby is Lisa's brother-in-law, Steph resumes her bullying. Johnno eventually catches her physically attacking Lisa, and orders her to leave her alone. The two go on to attend university together, where Steph apologises for her cruelty and they are able to reconcile. In the aftermath of her epilepsy diagnosis, Steph is initially unable to deal with her condition. Her father supports her, but ends up abandoning his family following the revelation that he has a secret son. Steph's mother Frankie remarries, and she comes to see her new stepfather, Jack Osborne (Jimmy McKenna), as a father figure, despite remaining close to her father and becomes the only family member to visit him. Steph largely reforms following her epilepsy diagnosis, becoming more sensitive to the needs of others. She comes to terms with how dangerous her condition could be if uncontrolled, and in time her epileptic episodes become less frequent. Steph fails her college exams and is forced to retake them. Fuelled by jealousy of her sister's West End success, she attempts to embark on a celebrity career. She appears in the fictional television show Bid Crazy TV, and auditions for a girl band, X-Pose, which transpires to be a money- making scam. She then sells a kiss and tell story on celebrity Joe Jones, who she meets after a failed audition to become one of his backing singers. When Steph's notoriety peters out, her stepbrother and agent Darren arranges for her to have sex with a footballer. After their liaison, Steph discovers that he is actually just the team's mascot. Humiliated, she abandons her pursuit of fame. In a comedy storyline, Steph's great-aunt Reenie leaves her an inheritance, said to be a \\"small fortune\\", on the condition that Steph performs a charitable act. She fulfils the requirement by saving Leo Valentine (Brian Bovell) from choking, however discovers that Small Fortune is, in fact, a donkey. Steph sends it to live at a donkey sanctuary. Steph becomes a babysitter to Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins), and later begins a relationship with his older brother, Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). They get engaged, but have an on-off relationship fraught with frequent arguments. Steph's friend, Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) falls madly in love with her and attempts to come between them. She and Max eventually marry, but on their wedding day, Niall accidentally runs Max over, killing him. After a period of intense grief, Steph has sex with Niall. He is revealed to be a villain, holding his family hostage and killing his sister, Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett). A frightened Steph goes to stay with Craig in Scotland. Niall follows her, and takes Steph, Tom and Craig hostage. After a stand-off in which Craig makes Niall acknowledge the hurt he has caused, Niall throws himself off a cliff to his death. After a long holiday with Tom, Steph returns and begins to put her life back together.

She and Fernando become engaged, as do Gilly and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh), Steph's employee. Realising that she loves Gilly, Steph breaks up with Fernando, but due to loyalty to Cheryl, refuses to date Gilly when he breaks up with her. Gilly briefly becomes engaged to Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark), but ultimately leaves her to be with Steph. Steph discovers she has cervical cancer, and has a hysterectomy. In the aftermath, she decides to pursue a singing career and applies for The X Factor. Despite using her cancer as a sob story, she is rejected at her audition. Her cancer spreads, and though Steph has chemotherapy, she is later told that her condition is terminal. Gilly struggles to cope with her diagnosis, almost causing Steph to cancel their wedding. It goes ahead, however, and after their honeymoon, Steph begins to make plans for her impending death. When Il Gnosh, a local Italian restaurant catches fire, Steph saves Amy Barnes and her children, but chooses to remain inside and die. After Steph's funeral, her family and friends watch video messages she recorded for them prior to her death. On 11 March 2011, Cindy returns and Darren tells her about Steph and plays her the goodbye message. On 26 December, Steph made a one-off appearance as a ghost to Doug Carter (PJ Brennan). Development =Casting and characterisation= Carley Stenson (pictured) said that Steph is a \\"lovable rogue who just likes making mischief for attention.\\" Stenson originally auditioned to play a friend of the established character Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). Although unsuccessful, the Hollyoaks casting team later asked her to apply for the new role of Steph Cunningham, and placed her straight into the final stage of auditions. She was delighted to subsequently be given the part, which was her first major television role. Stenson joined the cast straight after leaving high school, aged seventeen. She made her first appearance in March 2000, and by 2010 had become the longest-serving female cast member remaining. Steph was introduced as a friend of Zara's, who was initially \\"quite naive\\" and easily led. Within two years, her personality had altered greatly. Steph became a bully, and \\"a bit of a bitch\\". Stenson enjoyed this transformation into a villain, as she believed it made Steph a more memorable character. She also felt she could \\"really go somewhere\\" with Steph's bitchiness in her acting, but in contrast struggled to portray her more genuine moments. She commented that Steph is the type of character only to cry over things she \\"really cares about\\". Stenson found this difficult to relate to, and struggled to \\"find a balance between pushing it too far and far enough\\". She ultimately preferred to play her as a bitch, though one \\"more comical rather than just out-and-out nasty.\\" Stenson assessed that Steph \\"really isn't all bad, more of a lovable rogue who just likes making mischief for attention.\\" She deemed her character \\"very unpredictable\\", with a great deal of confidence. The LINC Online called her a \\"beautiful blonde wild child with a penchant for arrogance and displays of egotism\\". Sarah Moolla of The People branded her \\"superficial\\", the Daily Record Merle Brown referred to her as \\"a true red-blooded female, and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a \\"couldn't-care-less\\" attitude. BBC America described Steph as a two-sided character. They observed that as well as a bitch, she could be \\"dishonest, vain, jealous and small-minded\\", and wrote \\"She causes trouble when she wants to and will happily lie and gossip to get her own way.\\" Conversely, they noted that for those on her good side, \\"She can be your best friend, a confidante and sweet natured girl\\". As Steph developed, she was revealed to have a \\"softer side\\". Beneath her tough fa√ßade was a \\"deeply insecure little girl who crave[d] love and affection.\\" An \\"artistic and creative\\" streak lead her to attend performing arts college. This inspired a rivalry with fellow actor Summer Shaw (Summer Strallen), which saw Steph \\"determined to keep the limelight on her.\\" Stenson downplayed her vocal ability, and opined that Steph is \\"hardly the world's best singer\\". =Family and relationships= In late 2002, more than two years after Steph's arrival, her family were introduced to the series. The dynamics of the Dean family evolved with time. They were initially a dysfunctional unit, but in a different way to other Hollyoaks families, as they tended to disrupt the lives of others whilst being happy amongst themselves. Upon their arrival, actress Helen Pearson, who plays mother Frankie Dean, assessed that they were \\"really supportive of each other\\", and \\"quite solid, like an old-fashioned family unit\\", despite their lack of finances which required them to undertake \\"various scams to keep body and soul together.\\" As time went on, the Deans were affected by affairs and parental separation, more typical of the soap's other families. Steph had several romances throughout her time in the series. In her early years, Stenson played her as a flirt, who acted out for the attention of boys. Her first lovers included Christian virgin Brian Drake (Jonathan Le Billon) and football playing \\"lothario\\" Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Her later relationship with Cameron Clark (Ben Gerrard) had \\"ups and downs\\" due to his obsessive-compulsive disorder. To boost his confidence she forced him to join a rock band. Her actions were successful, and Stenson said Steph was \\"proud\\" of this. She sacrificed their relationship so Cameron could leave and tour Europe. Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap praised Steph for being so supportive, despite Cameron's \\"erratic behaviour\\". Steph appeared to \\"finally [find] happiness\\" when she fell in love with Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Although attracted to her, Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a \\"ditzy, air-headed blonde\\", only interested in \\"bad boys.\\" When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the \\"kind, sensitive way\\" Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, \\"Max begins to realise there's more to her than her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends.\\" Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed off on their wedding day, as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and \\"such an awful thing to happen to Steph\\", until she received \\"amazing feedback\\" about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent \\"what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss.\\" Kirkwood praised Stenson's performance throughout the storyline, particularly during that scene. Steph has a brief fling with Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane). The actors were required to film \\"steamy scenes\\". Stenson felt it a \\"hard challenge\\" to portray, she had to convince the audience that Steph would genuinely get together with her husband's killer. Some viewers, including all the staff of Inside Soap believed their chemistry to be greater. Stenson ultimately decided Steph was \\"better suited\\" to Max. She hoped that Steph would have even \\"more drama around the corner\\" along with \\"a bit of comic relief\\". =Illnesses= Epilepsy In a storyline which Stenson found challenging to portray, Steph was diagnosed with epilepsy. Feeling a responsibility to members of the viewing public who have the disorder, the actress researched it extensively, assisted by Mersey Television. As well as reading about it, she visited several organisations, and spent a day on set with a teenage girl‚Äîclose in age to Steph‚Äîwho has the condition, and who shared insights on the experiences she had been through. The actress felt trepidation about acting out seizures, but for her first one was assisted by the episode's director, who had witnessed seizures first-hand, having once worked in a hospital. Stenson felt privileged to be chosen for the storyline, particularly as epilepsy is typically a taboo subject which had not featured prominently in a soap opera before. Barbara Pinder of Epilepsy Action praised the serial for taking on the subject matter. Hollyoaks researchers contacted the charity when developing the storyline, and Pinder felt that the show succeeded in communicating the impact of Steph's diagnosis. She stated, \\"It is great to see a soap opera, specially one that is watched mainly by young people, look at the issue of epilepsy as it often gets ignored.\\" Stenson was pleased the storyline was \\"reaching out to people\\", and stated that she had received many letters from fans thanking her for highlighting an under-exposed subject, as well as positive feedback on the Hollyoaks website. Steph initially reacted angrily towards her diagnosis, which Pinder confirmed was not uncommon, explaining: \\"The character is going through stages that someone with epilepsy is likely to go through. Teenagers can have terrible trouble coming to terms with epilepsy at a time when they have a lot of other difficult things to deal with. It can also be quite a blow to their independence.\\" Writing for the Sunday Mail, Steve Hendry assessed that the plot would serve to \\"bring the arrogant and often spiteful Steph down a peg or two\\", humbling her. Stenson agreed that Steph's epilepsy would make her \\"more understanding\\", inspiring thoughtfulness towards others, as opposed to her former rejection of those different to her. However, she observed that the condition may also serve to worsen her behaviour towards \\"a chosen few.\\" The character's epilepsy was further explored in the Hollyoaks spin-off In Too Deep, in which Steph has a seizure and believes she is possessed by a spirit, almost causing her to drown. Cervical cancer In 2010, Steph was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent a hysterectomy. It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer. He chose to continue with it, deciding that it would be interesting to give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers \\"know and love going through a really hard time.\\" In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way. Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: \\"Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and I wanted to see it fresh through her eyes\\". She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline, and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign. The producers aimed to send a message of early detection to the series' young audience, and had Steph initially ignore her symptoms. Stenson hoped to raise awareness of cervical cancer, and educate women about the importance of regular smear tests. She stated that Steph was confident about beating her illness, as \\"the alternative [wa]sn't worth thinking about.\\" The character was originally reluctant to tell her family about the cancer for fear of hurting them, and was embarrassed to tell her love interest Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), not wanting him to have to look after her. As the storyline developed, Steph cancelled her wedding to Gilly due to his refusal to accept that her condition was terminal. Quinlan explained that his character impeded her ability to deal with the situation, with his disbelief contrasting Steph's attempt to \\"take this in her stride and [...] spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes.\\" Marquess deemed the storyline as a whole one which could only be depicted the way it was in Hollyoaks, aiming to tell a \\"tragic story\\" with a \\"sweet and humorous tone\\".\\" A comedy element of the storyline had Steph use her cancer as a sob story to enter a talent show, recruiting orphan Tom to take to the stage with her, giving her story further emotional impact. Stenson commented, \\"Deep down she knows she's not a fantastic singer, but she thought the judges would feel sorry for her and put her through.\\" According to Quinlan, viewer feedback on the storyline was \\"brilliant\\". He stated that viewers were upset by Steph's illness, and that it had even brought his own mother to tears. =Departure and death= In 2010, it was announced that Stenson had decided to quit the serial to pursue a career in musical theatre. She deemed it \\"one of the most difficult decisions [she had] ever made\\", stating that Hollyoaks had been her \\"dream job\\" and that she would miss her friends in the cast and crew. She made the decision to resign around June 2009, but was convinced by then-producer Lucy Allan to play out a long exit storyline, which concluded filming in September 2010. Before filming her final scenes, Stenson secured her first West End role. Though she had previously felt ready to leave the series, when the time came, she was upset because she felt the reality of it. She called her final scenes \\"really sad and emotional\\". Hollyoaks devised an arson plot to begin on Guy Fawkes Night 2010, as a result of which some characters would die. The production team intended to keep details of who would die secret until transmission. Prior to broadcast, Stenson revealed that Steph would risk her own life to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), Leah Barnes (Jessica Croft-Lane) and Lucas Hay. The actress explained that \\"She stares death in the face every day because of her cancer, so thinks she really has nothing to lose now.\\" Stenson performed one of her own stunts during filming, with the rest undertaken by a stunt double. A promotional trailer for the episodes aired across the Channel 4 network, featuring Steph on fire. In the event, Steph rescued Amy and her children from a burning building but refused to leave herself, saying she was ready to die. Her exit received a positive reaction from fans on the social networking website Twitter, with Stenson stating that she was \\"honoured\\" by the response. Steph's legacy continued following her death, with her husband, family and friends left to come to terms with their grief. On 29 November 2011 it was confirmed Stenson was to reprise the role for a one off guest appearance as Steph in which she appears as an angel to Doug Carter who had attempted suicide and she convinces him that his life matters. Steph tells Doug something and he shows Frankie a special song that Steph had recorded for her. Frankie, overjoyed that her daughter had not forgotten her, wept whilst Angel Steph looked on happily and placed a hand on her shoulder before winking to Tom and returning to heaven, stating she was \\"ready for her solo.\\" Reception Stenson received several award nominations for her portrayal of Steph. She was nominated in the \\"Best Comedy Performance\\" category at the 2005 and 2006 British Soap Awards, and for \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" in 2009. She received a long-list nomination for the \\"Best Actress\\" accolade at the 2005 National Television Awards. In 2008, Stenson was nominated for the \\"Sexiest Female\\" Inside Soap Award, which she found flattering. A further nomination in the same category followed in 2010, accompanied by nominations for \\"Best Actress\\", and \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" for Steph learning she had cancer. The character was selected as one of the \\"top 100 British soap characters\\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by What's on TV, with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover \\"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\\" Following her departure, her co- stars commented favourably on the actress and character, with Jorgie Porter deeming her an \\"ultimate original\\", Gemma Merna stating that she \\"was Hollyoaks\\", and Ricky Whittle admitting that he cried during the airing of her final scenes. Television and entertainment website Holy Soap did not see Steph's fire death coming, calling her actions brave and her ten-year duration \\"mammoth\\". They described her most memorable moment as telling Niall she did not love him and then watching him commit suicide. Inside Soap said if there was an award for \\"the unluckiest character in soap\\", Steph would certainly win. In his column for The Guardian, television critic Jim Shelley stated that it was time for Steph to go, having \\"suffered enough\\" during her tenure. Humorously recapping her ten years in Hollyoaks, Shelley wrote: Sarah Welsh of the South Wales Echo gave the stalking storyline a negative review. She called both plot and acting \\"ridiculous\\" and commented that while she often felt sorry for the serial being snubbed at the National Soap Awards, \\"This is not the way to raise the game.\\" Steph's relationships were a focal point of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) \\"surprising compelling\\". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: \\"With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage was ever going to last\\". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' \\"About You Now\\" at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury felt there was \\"plenty of chemistry\\" between Steph and Gilly. Reviewing the Steph-centric spin-off In Too Deep for The Times, Tim Teeman commented that while late-night Hollyoaks episodes had previously been amusing, \\"sexed-up\\" versions of the main show, with In Too Deep it became \\"less shagathon, more What Lies Beneath\\". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by Laws of the Sunday Mercury. The launch of Hollyoaks Later series one, in which Niall returns to target Steph, was named a \\"Satellite Pick of the Day\\" by the Daily Record. Christopher Howse, writing \\"Tatworld\\" for The Daily Telegraph‚Äîa column chronicling tabloid culture‚Äînamed Steph and her family joint tenth in a list of Top Ten Deans, which included entrants such as Dean Koontz, Dean Gaffney and Richard Dean Anderson.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 4 October 2005. Rhys was killed off in the Enjoy The Ride storyline in an episode airing on 15 November 2012 and the character departed on 16 November 2012. Rhys made a return on 27 June 2014 as part of his ex-girlfriend Cindy Cunningham's (Stephanie Waring) storyline about her bipolar disorder. Character creation and casting In 2004, Jo Hallows stepped down from her position as series producer at Hollyoaks and it was announced that David Hanson would succeed her in the role. In 2005, it was revealed that Hanson would introduce a new family to the series: the Ashworths consisting of father Neville Ashworth (Jim Millea), mother Suzanne (Suzanne Hall), son Josh (Sonny Flood), daughter Hannah (Emma Rigby), family friend Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and son Rhys. It was announced that television newcomer Andrew Moss had been cast as Rhys. In January 2010, it was announced that Lucy Allan had stepped down from the position of series producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters: Neville, Suzanne and Josh Ashworth. As well as the axings, Emma Rigby, who played Hannah, had chosen to quit the previous year, bowing out in February 2010. However, it was revealed that the character of Rhys would stay in the series after his on-screen family's departure along with Duncan Button (Dean Aspen), the family's godson. In July 2009, in an interview with soap website Holy Soap Moss revealed that exits of his on-screen family were sad, he commented, \\"It's really strange. We all started together. It was brilliant to come to a show like this as part of a family unit. You don't feel like you're on your own.\\" Character development In 2010 Rhys embarked on a \\"surprise\\" relationship with Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: \\"I think Rhys is going to fall in love again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while.\\" The relationship proved popular with viewers, during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism she and Moss had towards the pairing, stating: \\"When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui.\\" Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: \\"It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible.\\" She also adopted a \\"couple name\\" for the pair titled \\"Ja-Rhys\\". Rhys and Jacqui were given one of the biggest storylines for the first half of 2011 in the serial, of this Marquess stated: \\"They have got the biggest story for the first half of 2011. I think it may be one of the biggest stories in Hollyoaks history. It's very, very serious and I think it will really divide the audience. It will really test them and their relationship to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it.\\" Storylines =2005‚Äì2012= Rhys first appears as a person who comes to inspect his family's new home due to the Hunter family selling up.

Inside Soap critic Sarah said that during the Enjoy The Ride storyline \\"there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars, including [...] Andrew Moss\\". All About Soap journalist Kerry Barrett said viewers should \\"watch out for Andrew Moss\\" amongst other cast members \\"who all act their socks off\\", while her colleague Carena Crawford said she was shocked at Rhys' death AfterElton.com's Anthony D. Langford said he was not \\"shocked\\" at Rhys' death but that he \\"was sorry to see him go\\". Langford said that he could see why the serial \\"had to kill him off because they had basically written the character into a corner\\". He said that he did not understand why the serial decided to take Rhys in the direction they did, explaining that after \\"everything that he and Jacqui had been through [...] it made no sense for Rhys to throw what had been a strong marriage away on a fling with Cindy [...] I never bought for a minute that he would not only have an affair with her, but fall in ‚Äòlove‚Äô with her and want to leave Jacqui for her. It was bad writing and totally out of character\\". He opined that the scenes of Rhys \\"sneaking around\\" to meet with Cindy were \\"appalling\\" and that he \\"kept thinking that ‚ÄòRhys would never do that‚Äô during the entire storyline\\". Langford concluded that Moss and Cooper \\"were beautiful and heartbreaking in those moments, reminding you of the love and connection that they had for much of their relationship. The fact that Rhys had been inexplicably cheating on Jacqui the whole time took away from how powerful those scenes could have and should have been\\".

Hannah first appeared on-screen on 30 September 2005 and her last appearance was on 12 February 2010. The character was in a controversial storyline in which she developed anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The storyline attracted much attention from the press and won much critical acclaim for the writing and Rigby's performance. It also featured Hannah's best friend, Melissa Hurst, dying as result of an eating disorder, which was a first for British soaps. Rigby won many different awards for her portrayal of the character, including Best Actress at the 2008 British Soap Awards. Creation =Background= The character of Hannah was part of a new family unit which was cast in the show called the Ashworths, who moved into the Hunter family's old home. Her parents are Neville and Suzanne and brothers Rhys and Josh. Hannah's storylines are initially fairly lighthearted, because while Hannah was supposed to be 16, actress Emma Rigby was herself still 15 and therefore subject to the UK child employment laws which limited her availability for filming. =Casting= Auditions were held for the part of Hannah and actress Emma Rigby went on to gain the part. During some of the storylines the actress commented that playing the character was sometimes depressing and tiring but had this to say about one of her storylines: \\"I just threw myself into it, really. I didn't want it to be unrealistic or disrespectful to people who suffer from the illness and I didn't want to glamorise it, either. It was announced on 8 November 2008 that Rigby had decided to quit the show in order to pursue other projects, but her character would still be on-screen until June 2009. On 2 March 2009 it was announced that Rigby had extended her contract by a further six months after new producer Lucy Allen convinced her to stay with promises of a 'juicy' exit plotline. She was then scheduled to depart in December 2009. It was later confirmed she would leave early 2010. Development =Personality and identity= Once sunny and outgoing, tragedy has taken its toll on the character. Channel 4 publicity commented that the character's storylines are the factors which affected the character's self-esteem with putting up with the constant drama revolving around her family, being dumped by her boyfriend, and Grace Hutchinson's death all contributed to her developing the illness bulimia. Hannah later became much more confident and in control of her life. Hannah is also known to be slightly ditzy and sometimes spoiled. =Relationships= The character's first relationship came when a storyline saw her falling for her classmate John Paul McQueen. Their friends at the time Sarah and Craig, were also dating and set them up as a couple. Although at first the relationship appeared to be going well, John Paul was clearly uneasy and his hesitance made the relationship turbulent. When they eventually slept together, John Paul realised he did not want a relationship with Hannah and broke up with her. Hannah had no idea John Paul was actually struggling with his sexuality, which he attempted to conceal by pretending to be attracted to Sarah. At Hannah's 18th birthday party, John Paul tells Craig he is love with him and then runs off, leaving Hannah to ponder what is going with him. The following month, Hannah spotted John Paul and Craig sharing a drunken kiss. The character was reluctant to let John Paul go, until he finally admitted his sexuality, which left her devastated. In hope of reconciliation she remained friends with him. During this period she attempts to sabotage John Paul's new relationship with Spike. It was the breakup with John Paul that sent her into a spiral of bulimia and anorexia. It was not until the character was on the road to recovery that she had a new on screen romance. Hannah started a relationship with Danny Valentine and their relationship was characterised by his frequent lack of tact in some issues. He also agreed to stand by her knowing she was fragile from her ordeal with eating disorders. The characters often broke up and reconciled but eventually they ended their relationship after Danny accused her of sleeping with Darren Osborne and then slept with Mercedes McQueen to get back at her. Following the collapse of his relationship with Sarah Barnes, Elliot realised he and Hannah would be better suited. When Hannah decided to run for Student Entertainments Officer, Elliot rigged the vote in her favour. They later began dating, but Elliot soon exhibited sexual self-consciousness and avoided confronting the issue by spending more time with her father Neville, with whom he shared an interest in robots and rockets. Their relationship subsequently ended. Hannah later had a brief relationship with a minor celebrity called Matt and Ash Roy later tried to win Hannah's affections. She was charmed by his good looks and his rich lifestyle. He took her to dinner with his sister Leila Roy and her boyfriend Justin Burton. It didn't go down to well when Justin and Ash had an argument. Hannah did not realise at the time that Justin was in love with her.Digital Spy: Producer's Perspective 2008: Bryan Kirkwood However, she soon realised that it is Justin she liked not Ash and the pair shared a kiss which led Justin to break up with Leila the next day. After a motorbike accident left Hannah fighting for her life, the blame was put on Justin. Unknown to Justin at the time, it was in fact Ash who had tampered with the bike, intending Justin to be riding it not Hannah. It was later revealed however by Leila that it was Ash who caused the accident. This led to Hannah breaking up with Ash and apologising to Justin. Although at first Justin didn't want to know as he couldn't forgive Hannah for thinking it was him that almost killed her, Hannah admitted her real feelings at a concert at the SU Bar where Mcfly were playing. Justin then told Hannah how he felt and the two finally got together and shared a kiss, which Ash saw and walked out. Hannah admitted to Justin that she did have a relapse, but it was after the whole Ash hiding the food in her room incident. Justin then went on to be honest with Hannah and confessed his darkest secret to her, that he helped Warren bury Sean Kennedy's body. Justin and Hannah finally get together, but someone burns down the loft with Warren and Hannah in it. Warren is seemingly killed (although returns for a later storyline) but Justin manages to rescue Hannah. They hope to be together but Justin is blamed for the fire and decides to make a run for it. Justin says he will leave with Hannah, but tricks her and leaves without her because he doesn't want her to suffer with a life on the run. Hannah is distraught. Much later on Darren and Hannah get married on a drunken road trip. Hannah arrives home and refuses to divorce because she is so young. They later move in together and begin to look out for each other. Storylines Hannah arrives in Hollyoaks with her parents, Neville and Suzanne, and brothers Rhys and Josh. She plays pranks on Josh and their cousin Fletch by pretending to be the fabled Hollyoaks Beast. Hannah becomes friends with Sarah Barnes and Nancy Hayton. One night, Hannah and Nancy are babysitting Tony and Mandy Hutchinson's daughter Grace, who dies from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Hannah is traumatised and guilt-ridden from the experience. Hannah begins dating classmate, John Paul McQueen. Hannah falls in love with him and they lose their virginity to each other. Hannah is devastated when John Paul breaks up with her and is even more upset when she learns he has feelings for Sarah. Distraught by everything, Hannah binges on food and becomes sick. John Paul and Hannah later get back together, but then Hannah catches him kissing their friend, Craig Dean, at a school dance (Craig was actually the person John Paul had feelings for). In the heat of the moment, Hannah announces to everyone what she saw. Afterwards, Hannah tells John Paul they can just pretend the kiss never happened, but John Paul says they cannot and he has realised he is gay. Hannah is devastated and becomes convinced she \\"made\\" him gay because of how \\"repulsive\\" she is. Hannah develops bulimia and begins regularly binging and purging. Hannah becomes friends with Sarah's model friend, Melissa Hurst. Under Melissa's influence, Hannah's bulimia turns into anorexia. Melissa, herself a bulimic turned anorexic, offers her some tips on how to starve herself and hide her disorder from others. All of Hannah's friends become suspicious of her weight loss and change in behaviour. Sarah misinterprets a conversation between Hannah and Melissa and believes that Hannah is taking drugs. Sarah tells Suzanne about Hannah's \\"drug use\\" and Suzanne confronts Hannah about Sarah's accusations. Hannah denies using drugs and is furious with Sarah for meddling in her life. Rhys's best friend, Gilly Roach, also becomes convinced that Hannah is taking drugs. Annoyed with Gilly's interference, Hannah threatens to falsely accuse him of sexually assaulting her if he does not keep his mouth shut. The situation comes to a head when the Ashworths have a barbecue and Melissa refuses to let Hannah eat anything, causing Rhys to kick her out. Melissa collapses on the street and is rushed to the hospital where she is put in intensive care. With Suzanne still convinced Hannah was taking drugs, Hannah lies to her mother that her recent behaviour was because Gilly had sexually assaulted her. However, the truth about Hannah's condition is finally revealed to her family. After days of abuse from Rhys and Josh, being hounded by Suzanne, and having her condition misunderstood by Neville, Hannah feels she needs to escape. She engineers a plot to escape the country with Melissa, who is worried that being force-fed while in the hospital will cause her to get fat. Hannah breaks Melissa out of hospital, but then Melissa collapses of a heart attack, brought on by lack of food and body abuse, and dies. Hannah cradles Melissa's lifeless body and cries hysterically. Emma Rigby (pictured) said it was a real honour to take part in such a \\"good\\" storyline. Hannah finds it hard to move on from Melissa's death. Hannah tells everyone she is doing better, but her anorexia continues. Hannah hides it from her family by asking for food and then hiding it in her room. John Paul tries to be there for Hannah, but she lays into him for lying to her and tells him their break-up triggered her eating disorder. Hannah also admits she is still in love with John Paul and that she hopes someone hurts him as badly as he hurt her. After Sarah finds out that Craig cheated on her with John Paul, Hannah tells her she knows exactly the pain she is in and the two women comfort each other. Hannah is caught in the middle of an argument between Sarah and John Paul, during which she passes out. Both Suzanne and Sarah try to convince themselves it is a delayed reaction from her condition, after a search of her room initially finds no sign of hidden food. Later, after noticing the carpet has been pulled up, Suzanne discovers the rotting remains of food Hannah had been hiding under the floor boards. With her daughter's life on the line, Suzanne has Hannah sectioned under the Mental Health Act and healthcare workers arrive to take her to hospital. Hannah locks herself in her room, but is talked out by Rhys. Hannah gets treatment in an eating disorder unit and is deemed fit for release after two months. The Ashworths begin family therapy and Hannah is forced to confront the issues which led to her problems. Hannah gets her life back on track and begins attending Hollyoaks Community College. Hannah makes her peace with John Paul and they agree to be friends. Hannah also begins dating Danny Valentine. Neville does not want Danny with his daughter and Hannah initially believes Neville is just being protective, but then she finds out it is actually because Danny is black. Hannah stands up for Danny and the two decide they truly want to be together. Danny wrongly believes that Hannah slept with Darren Osborne and in turn sleeps with Mercedes McQueen, which ends their relationship. Elliot Bevan develops feelings for Hannah. When Hannah decides to run for Student Entertainments Officer, Elliot rigs the vote in her favour. Hannah was furious when she finds out, but Elliot tells her he did it because he likes her. They begin dating, but Elliot has some sexual self-consciousness and avoids confronting the issue by spending more time with Neville, with whom he shares an interest in robots and rockets. This leads to their relationship subsequently ending. Hannah takes a trip to the MTV Europe Music Awards where she meets Matt and briefly dates him. Hannah starts dating Ash Roy, who gives her many gifts. Hannah becomes attracted to Justin Burton and Justin himself developed feelings for her. Justin and Ash compete for Hannah's affections. The two arrange a motorbike race. Hannah rides Justin's bike and crashes. Justin initially receives the blame for the accident until Leila and Justin expose Ash as being the one responsible because he had tampered with Justin's bike before the race. Consequently, Hannah dumps Ash and begins dating Justin. To get revenge, Ash hid food in Hannah's room to try to convince her family she was still ill. Hannah denies hiding the food, but admits she had a brief relapse with her bulimia, but she got herself back on track. Hannah and Justin planned on running away together until the return of Clare Devine. Clare sets fire to Warren Fox's nightclub The Loft. Clare was seen in many stunts taking place in the scenes. Hannah survived after Justin saved her whereas Warren died. Justin later received the blame for the fire and the pair tried to convince others that it was Clare who started the fire. Justin left Hollyoaks and left Hannah, believing it was what's best for her. Hannah's parents still did not believe her when she said she did not hide the food in her room which was planted by Ash, so she moved in with Nancy Hayton and Zoe Carpenter. Still feeling down after her split with Justin, Hannah got drunk and met band member Stav who took both her and Darren on a weekend to Denmark. Upon returning, Darren revealed that the pair had in fact got married. They later agreed to get their marriage annulled. However, Cindy told Darren (with whom she was planning to con Tony out of his money) that being married to Hannah he could regain control of The Dog. After realising this, Darren raced to Hannah and convinced her to re-think the annulment. Darren and Hannah eventually slept together and Hannah thought that this could lead to a proper relationship. Darren let her down by telling her she's too sensible for him. In September 2009, Ash's sister Leila told Gilly Roach it was Ash who planted the food in Hannah's room to make everyone think she had had a relapse. Consequently, Suzanne and Hannah had a heart to heart and Suzanne apologised. Hannah, Rhys and Josh went away to a music festival. At the festival, she met Imogen, Kev and Jamie, drug dealers who groomed Hannah and Rhys into joining their gang. Hannah slept with Jamie and began to fall in love with him. However, when she discovered his drug dealing, Hannah tried to leave but he eventually convinced her to stay. That night, the pair shared an ecstasy tablet. Hannah found out Imogen was a prostitute, who Kev was using to get money. He then attacked Hannah and told her she would do the same in the future, causing Jamie to hit him and let Hannah escape. Hannah and Jamie drove off in his ice-cream van. Unbeknownst to them, Kev had hidden drugs in the van. Kev kidnapped Rhys and threatened to kill him if Hannah and Jamie did not return with his drugs. However, Jamie and Hannah returned without the drugs. Jamie lied to both Hannah and Kev saying he didn't have the drugs and this led to Kev threatening to kill Hannah with a gun to her head. Jamie had called Kev's bluff and Jamie and Hannah returned to the beach. Hannah eventually discovered the drugs in Jamie's bag and left him. She got onto a coach where she texted Sarah Barnes, unaware that she had died in her parachute jump as her girlfriend Lydia Hart unintentionally sabotaged her parachute. When she returned to the village, Mike told her of Sarah's death and she broke down in tears. When Nancy's ex- husband Jake Dean returned from a psychiatric unit, he revealed that Hannah had been sending him letters. However, Hannah told Nancy she had only sent one, telling him to stay away. This led to a fall out with Nancy, but they made up when Hannah broke down during her speech at Sarah's funeral. Whilst working at The Dog, Hannah catches Anita Roy being sick due to excessive alcohol consumption. However, Hannah believes Anita is bulimic. Wanting the attention, Anita deceives Hannah, making her believe she has an eating disorder. Hannah gives Anita her diary of when she was anorexic. This leads to an argument with Nancy and Anita's sister Leila. Feeling at her lowest, Hannah has to stop herself from binging. When Anita catches Hannah being sick, she feels guilty and confesses she made the illness up. Angry at this, Hannah tells Leila and Anita's brother Ravi. Anita then informs Suzanne and Rhys about witnessing Hannah being sick, realising she has made her relapse. Hannah moves in with Darren following her family's interference and she starts to make herself sick. When Anita tries to tell Hannah to get help, she becomes angry, and throws her out. Darren catches her being sick and tells Rhys and Josh. Hannah later attacks him, before he tells her to leave the flat, which she does. Moving back in with her family, the Ashworths begin to become overprotective of Hannah. In order to convince them that nothing is wrong with her, Hannah gets Nev and Suzanne to take her to hospital, where the Ashworths are informed of her weight loss. Hannah then escapes the hospital. Darren finds her, as she is making plans to flee the country. When he realises his own family will not forgive him for several reasons, Darren steals money from Steph Cunningham and tells Hannah he will leave with her. During their time on the run from their families, Hannah collapses, and Darren questions whether she has eaten. Later on, she collapses again and seizures. Rhys and Josh discover Hannah and Darren's whereabouts when he calls them. An angry Hannah tells her brothers to leave as Darren calls an ambulance. Hannah is admitted into an eating disorder unit of the hospital, where she refuses to let her family believe she is ill. Later, she tells Darren she wants to die. Hannah slowly recovers in hospital and bonds with Zoe Carpenter. She is relieved when doctors tell her she is well enough to leave. In February 2010, Hannah makes a life changing decision that she leaves Hollyoaks to be independent. At first, her family refuses to let her go, thinking she's not ready and mature enough to go on her own. However, they think she would learn things in life, so they let her leave. Hannah goes to see her husband, Darren, and leaves him a present, telling him not to open it until after she has left. When he opens it he finds a photo of himself and Hannah, a message which says that he is the best husband ever and ¬£5 000. Hannah is unable to attend her brother Rhys' funeral in 2012 as it is revealed she is suffering from shingles due to stress. Reception Hannah's eating disorder storyline gained much press attention in part because it became the first British soap opera to feature a character dying on-screen from an eating disorder, with the death of Melissa Hurst. but was garnered with praise for showing the harsh realities of the disorders. With actress Emma Rigby giving a message of advice stating: Disordered Eating, a website dedicated to the awareness of eating disorders said that the characters storylines had succeeded in raising awareness and provoking much discussion of the huge problem of eating disorders. Actress Emma Rigby has won numerous awards for her portrayal of Hannah and the storylines given, including Best Actress at The British Soap Awards 2008, and another from The Mental Health Awards. Different media sources reported the character is the only one to raise the issue of eating disorders and size zero, stating that Hollyoaks were not afraid to do so and praising the team for using the character to break the ground.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 3 October 2005 and left on 14 July 2010, after Josh was axed by executive producer Paul Marquess. Josh's storylines have included attempted murder, underage sex, drugs, drinking and joyriding. Flood returned to filming as Josh for 3 episodes airing in May and August 2012. Casting Josh was created in 2005 by David Hanson and Sonny Flood secured the role. In early 2010, it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing the entire remaining Ashworth family, apart from Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). The move was part of his reinvention of the serial and clearing out the \\"deadwood\\". Marquess later revealed he axed the Ashworths because he believed The Dog should have a lively family at the heart of it, that the Ashworths had become grim because of their hard hitting storylines. In May 2012 it was announced that Flood returned to filming for two episodes. Josh was involved in a storyline alongside the characters of Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies).  Storylines  = 2005‚Äì2012 = After arriving in the village, Josh and his sister, Hannah (Emma Rigby) fight over who gets the biggest bedroom. Their parents, Neville (Jim Millea) and Suzanne (Suzanne Hall), decide to let them sort it out for themselves and they race to reach the biggest room. However, older brother Rhys (Andrew Moss) already moved his stuff in and tells Josh and Hannah that he will need the room for when his best friend, Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), comes to stay. Josh and his cousin Fletch then begin a tour in the woods to see the \\"Hollyoaks Beast\\". When Hannah discovers what they are doing, she and her two best friends, Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), play a trick on Josh and Fletch by pretending to be the \\"real\\" beast. Josh and Fletch become frightened and Josh starts to give a speech about how he would miss his sister and that he should be nicer to her. He is surprised to discover that Hannah was playing the joke. Josh and Fletch tried to get on the Year 12 \\"Fit List\\". However, Josh was tricked by Sarah, her sister Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) into stripping off in front of a class that was full of students. Josh and Fletch got their revenge on Hannah, Sarah and Nancy by doing an interview with the girls and editing the material to make it look as if their answers were embarrassing. Josh and Fletch made the interview available for the whole school to hear; the three females got their revenge by stealing Josh's childhood toys and putting them on display. Josh decided to end the war; he and Hannah formed a truce. Around Christmas 2005, Bill Ashworth (John Jardine) came to temporarily stay with the family. Josh manages to persuade Neville and Suzanne to let Fletch spend Christmas with them. The two friends do not get on well with Bill, although Bill adores Hannah, and the pair find out that Bill has won some money on the horses. They manage to persuade Bill to buy some new clothes, but only on the condition that they have the clothes from the charity shops. Bill is unimpressed with choice of the clothes and Josh tells Fletch that Bill there is no point him spending his money as he would not be alive to enjoy it. Upon hearing this, Bill makes a bet with his two grandchildren on the day they thought he would die. Rhys and Gilly also make a bet and Bill chooses the day he would die as Christmas Day. A few days before Christmas, Bill finds his war medals missing and blames Gilly. Eventually, he finds out that Josh and Fletch have taken them to frame for his Christmas present. Bill apologises to Gilly and the whole family eat their Christmas lunch together. After lunch, the family noticed Bill not breathing and Josh, Fletch, Hannah, Rhys, Gilly, Suzanne and Neville all stood round Bill assuming him to be dead. He sprung awake and asked Josh, Fletch, Rhys and Gilly for the money he had just won for the bet they had made. Months then passed and Neville forced a reluctant Josh to visit his Bill in his rest home along with Fletch. When Josh and Fletch saw how sad and lonely Bill was in his rest home. Josh then tried to tell his parents about Bill, but his dad was busy with work as he had to make some staff changes at Price Slice while Suzanne was busy with the family. Josh and Fletch managed to persuade Bill to leave his home and the pair sneaked him into the Ashworth house. A few days passed and eventually Bill was found by Suzanne, she called a family meeting with the rest of the family and had a vote as to whether or not Bill could stay in the house. Suzanne was out voted as Bill had bribed his grandchildren to get them to vote his way. At school Josh and Fletch were confronted by Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Wayne Tunnicliffe (Joe Marsden), who told Josh that they fancied Hannah. They asked Josh and Fletch to hang out with them after school and be in their gang. They encouraged the two cousins to smash up cars before Ste asked Josh if he and Wayne could come by his house to meet Hannah. The first time they came round Neville asked them to leave but Wayne recognised Neville from working at Price Slice with Hannah and Neville gave the two lads a lecture in how he manages the supermarket. After going round to the Ashworths' house a few more times Ste and Wayne were bored of Hannah always being at either Sarah or Nancy's houses. Things were looking bleak at the Ashworth House after Neville was fired from Price Slice after refusing to fire a long term employee, to save the shareholders of Price Slice's money. This meant that Suzanne had to do extra shifts for her job as a nurse at the local hospital. Neville wanted to buy the local shop, Drive 'N' Buy after it was put up for sale by the owner Max Cunningham (Matt Littler), but the family couldn't afford the shop. Bill decided to give his son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren their inheritance as he wanted to be around to see them enjoy it. Hannah and Rhys were going to spend their share on a holiday while Josh wanted to buy a new mountain bike, but Neville realised that his share alone would not be able to buy Drive 'N' Buy. He asked the family to but all their shares together but they all refused. Bill, with help from Fletch, managed to persuade Hannah and Rhys to do the right thing (using emotional blackmail). Josh was then told by Fletch that it would pay off for him in the long run and that if he did not do the right thing Neville would have to get a 9 to 5 job and Suzanne would have to carry on doing extra shifts and Josh would never see them, just like Fletch's own parents. This along with a little nudge from Hannah and Bill, persuaded Josh to give up his share. Though Josh did ask if he could keep a bit of his money. Josh tried again to be cool with Ste, so he copied an adult video for Ste, who had just got back with Amy. Ste asked if he could go to the Ashworths' house to get it, so he, Amy, Josh and Fletch went round there and Ste noticed Neville had left his car keys on show. Ste then took the boys and Amy for a joyride in Neville's car before bringing it back again. He, Fletch, Michaela and Amy were walking home from school when Ste pulled up in a stolen BMW. Ste told them all to get in the car and he drove the car across town. The police started chasing them but Ste lost them and told the others to get out of the car while he ditched it. In school he and Fletch overheard Amy, Michaela and Ste planning to skip school and go joyriding again. Amy wanted to stir a situation between Ste and the two cousins by telling Ste that Josh and Fletch criticised his driving. Ste told the two that they should come with them so he could prove how great a driver he was, but Fletch refused and Josh hesitated. Ste and the girls went and left them behind. While walking home from school that day they found Ste and the two girls waiting for them. Ste threatened them with a beating if they didn't get in the car. Josh was easier to persuade then Fletch who only went along because Josh was going. Josh wanted Ste to think he was cool and bought him and the others some beer. Ste's plan was to prove to the two cousins that he was an experienced driver by speeding and swerving on the road and trying to frighten them before leaving them stranded in the countryside. While driving dangerously down the road he turned around to ask Josh and Fletch, \\"How's my driving?\\" and took his eyes of the road. The others in the car shouted to him to watch the road. Ste turned around just in time to see a divider in the road; he swerved to avoid it and ended up crashing the car. Ste ran off after leaving Josh, Fletch and Michaela with an injured Amy, who had not been wearing a seatbelt. Ste told the others to keep quiet about him otherwise he would kill them all. Josh and Fletch were arrested at the scene and spent the night in a police cell, while Michaela went to the hospital with Amy. Days passed and Josh, Fletch, Amy and Michaela were convicted for joyriding and sentenced to community service. A few days later Josh and Fletch ran into Ste who was hiding in the village and along with Michaela's brother John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) managed to hand Ste over to PC Calvin Valentine. A few months later Josh was partnered, for a school assignment, with Amy. The two got on well together during the assignment and Josh took the risk of asking Amy out: to his joy she said yes. Josh does not know that Amy is seven months pregnant, though neither Josh nor Ste is the father, or that Amy is only dating Josh as he is a good laugh and is a distraction from her current problem, which was also the reason she went joyriding with Ste and Michaela. Suzanne who was a nurse at the hospital at and was attending to Amy, knows of her pregnancy, she told Amy to stay away from her son. Amy then broke up with Josh and he started moping around the house until Rhys and Gilly suggested he write down his heartbreak into a song. This gave Josh an idea and he wrote Amy a song called \\"I'm in Love\\". He persuaded Fletch to record the music and together they sang the song at Hannah's 18th Birthday party. Amy ran out embarrassed because she did not want the school to know she was dating Josh, but she did admit to Josh, who had run out after her, leaving Fletch to sing the song by himself, that she thought it was sweet of him to create a song for her and the two then got back together. After getting back with Amy, Josh invited her round to his house. Rhys gave Josh a condom and told him that girls like a man who is experienced and in control. When Amy came over the two started kissing and Josh tried to take things further but Amy became cross and Josh realised he had done the wrong thing and apologised. They then started talking about the future and Josh asked Amy if she would be attending 6th form. Amy replied that she didn't know and Josh told her he'd be going. The two then started arm wrestling and playing about. The next day Josh noticed someone had dropped a necklace on the ground and gave it to Amy as a present and asked her out on a date, which she accepted. But later Rhys told Josh he'd have to look after the shop because his band had just got a gig. Josh closed the shop and set up a picnic as a surprise for Amy. She was about to tell him something - presumably that she was pregnant - but Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) came into the shop to buy supplies for baby Charlie. A few weeks later Josh noticed Amy having stomach problems at school but she told him it was PMS and he invited her round to his house to use Suzanne's therapeutic pillow. He went to get some music for Amy but when he came back into the room he noticed Amy had left and there was a wet patch on his bed. Josh assumed she had wet herself because she hadn't been feeling well, but actually her waters had broken. Josh then phoned Amy on her mobile and left a message to tell her not to worry about the bed. The following week Amy missed school and had her baby which she called Leah, while Josh was off sick because of the flu. When he recovered he and Fletch set up a party. Josh wanted to invite Amy, but could not find her. He did, however manage to invite Amy's best mate, Michaela. Amy tried texting him but he didn't receive any of her messages. Fletch gave Josh a condom and told him to get lucky with some other girls but Josh only wanted Amy. Amy later arrived with Michaela and started drinking heavily because of her problems with Leah. Josh went up to talk to her and Amy asked him why he did not answer her texts. She then asked him to go upstairs with her to his room and forced herself on him, but Josh did not want to take advantage of her in the drunken state she was in. Just then Michaela burst into his room and assumed Josh had tried to have sex with Amy while she was drunk. She took Amy home, leaving a confused Josh behind. The following day he tried to text and phone Amy to see if she was all right but she was busy dealing with a health visitor. Amy and Josh made up with each other, and started spending more time together, after reading Amy's diary her father Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) came to school and dragged Amy home, mistakenly believing that Josh was the father of baby Leah. He then dragged her to get the pill, despite Amy protests that she and Josh hadn't slept together and then banned them from seeing each other. Meanwhile, at school Sarah had a talk with Josh and believed him when he told her he hadn't slept with Amy. The following day at school Amy told Josh what had happened and they noticed Mike walking around school. They then decided to cut classes and Amy sold her bracelet and Josh his guitar so they could go on an expensive date together. Then they went to a party at Il Gnosh where Mike confronted Amy infont of everyone and dragged her home. The next day Josh went round to the Barnes' house, where the pair found Mike's home brew, and stole some, getting drunk as it was much stronger than they had believed it to be. Mike burst in on them after they had been dancing and fallen on the bed, getting the wrong idea. He tried to kick Josh out the house and banned him from seeing Amy, but when he implied that Amy was a prostitute (because of getting pregnant, which Josh didn't know) Josh stood up to him for Amy, and as a result, Mike punched him in the face. Trying to hide his black eye from Suzanne, Josh almost managed it, but was found out when she came home from work. After letting slip it was Mr Barnes, his Mum stormed down to see him, and Josh followed her, trying to stop her. After a confrontation at Drive'N'Buy, Suzanne warned Amy to stay away from her son, and Mike dragged Amy away. They still continued to meet, and after references to Romeo and Juliet, they decided to meet in Amy's room, where Josh would climb through the window. They talked while lying on the bed, and Josh brought up the topic of Amy's new baby \\"sister\\" and that he didn't think the baby was Kathy's. When Amy asked him who he thought Leah belonged to he suggested Sarah and let slip that he thought getting pregnant as a teenager was for stupid people. Amy retaliated, but before anything could happen, Mike came along, and Josh had to hide in the cupboard, hearing the hints Mike was dropping about Amy being Leah's mother. However, he can't have guessed, as they met the next day, this time at the Ashworth's house, where Rhys and Gilly caught them. After bargaining with Rhys, the two were free to go upstairs, as long as they didn't get caught. Josh recently hit girlfriend Amy's dad with a brick while defending himself (but it wasn't his fault!!). No one except Gilly, Rhys, Mike and Josh knew of this. Mike then gave Josh a choice, split up with Amy or he will report him for assault. Josh realised that either way he won't see Amy so in the end just as Amy is about to tell Josh the truth about Leah's parentage he dumps her. Wanting to be together Josh and Amy ran away together, but when they were robbed called Amy's sister Sarah for help. When she arrived she brought the police with her. Josh was arrested for the attack on Mike. He was released on bail, after lying about his whereabouts. Mike later dropped the charges after an agreement with Suzanne, which meant that she would not tell anyone about Amy being Leah's mother. At Amy's 16th birthday party, she revealed that Leah was not her sister, but her daughter. Josh didn't know about this, and was annoyed and upset that Amy had not told him this. He later found out that Suzanne knew, as she had been Amy's nurse after the joyriding incident. He was annoyed about this, although he later appeared to have forgiven her for not telling him about it, due to patient confidentiality. He later broke up with Amy as he felt he couldn't trust her anymore. When Josh came back late from France with Rhys, he found someone whom he loved known as Felicity, but she wanted nothing to do with him, leaving him really upset. Rhys comforted him, but Melissa said to \\"get over it\\", which led Rhys to throw her and Hannah out, causing Melissa to later collapse. Josh was deeply worried about Hannah after the truth of her bulimia was revealed. Josh thought he might be to blame, since he often slags her over her weight. When Hannah and Melissa tried to run away, Josh found them and, out of concern for Hannah, called out for Suzanne. He tried to get Hannah to tell them what they had done wrong but was interrupted by Melissa's heart attack. When Hannah's condition continued to worsen, Josh got more and more frustrated because no one was dealing with the situation. He finally had enough with Suzanne and Rhys's arguing, and out of concern for Hannah, tried to force feed her a cream cake, before collapsing in tears after Rhys managed to pull him off her. Josh is in tears over his lack of family's support over Hannah's eating disorder and is spotted by Amy in the park. At first she is apprehensive about seeing him warning him not to speak to her, but she soon realises he is upset and consoles him. He confides in her about his problems and they nearly kiss, but are interrupted by the arrival of Amy's sister Sarah. After Hannah has been sent to hospital, Amy bumps into Josh again where he confides Hannah's situation to her and the two agree to meet up later the next day. Problem was that while Amy was waiting for Josh he was comforting his mum over Hannah. After Amy had waited a while, plus phoned Josh's mobile but he did not answer, she crashed into Ste. She went with Ste to his squat so by the time Josh went over to see Amy she was already gone. He wrote her a note and left it on her doorstep but she didn't notice it as she went inside her home and the note blew away. Amy then began a relationship with Ste, but it ended after Ste began to abuse Amy. Josh enters the reformed Baby Diegos (minus Amy) in the battle of the bands but disaster strikes when Fletch turns up stoned and plays Amy Josh Forever, much to their embarrassment. He claims to be drunk, but Michaela finds heroin in his bag and confronts him with it. However, this backfires and ends with everyone thinking the drugs are hers. Josh later talks to Fletch, telling him he will help if Fletch admits to taking the heroin. Fletch still refuses and Josh walks away from him, possibly forever. He tries to continue the band with just him and Michaela, but when at his house for practise, she spots Rhys and Beth kissing. She spends the next day desperately trying to avoid him, but when he confronts her she admits all to him. Later, Josh confronts Rhys and Beth with the rumours, and despite their suspicious behaviour he believes their denial and sends Michaela packing. He is now friendless. It is now apparent that Michaela and Josh are now friends again after finding out that Beth and Rhys were lying about not being together. On 2 April Michaela receives a letter informing her of her HIV test, but she was worried and did not want to go, although after a small confrontation with Josh, he decided to attend with her and found out she had the all clear. After Amy breaks up with Ste they once again become close. In the end, Amy asks Josh to take her to an abortion clinic, which he agrees to do. However, Amy then reveals that Ste was never the father of Leah and Josh runs out. Amy comes to apologise, and tells him that he wants them to get back together. She then tells him to shut his eyes and she kisses him with her hands cupped like antlers (she once kissed him years ago when she was wearing fake antlers). Josh remembers, and they get back together. After Ste taunts Josh, Josh reveals that Amy asked him to go to the abortion clinic with her. Ste tries to convince Amy not to have the abortion, but she admits that she does not want to go through with the abortion anyway. Ste tries to win her back, but she tells him to stay away from her and her baby, and that she is now with Josh. Although angry with Josh for revealing her secret about the abortion, they get back together while a gutted Ste demolishes his flat. During Hollyoaks Later, he along with Amy, Sasha and Micheala performed in Liverpool, where they met the Saturdays. During the episodes he offended Sasha calling her a druggie and made Amy play drums to hide the fact that she is pregnant. After this he was offered a record label but they only wanted him so he turned it down, in order to stay with Amy and become her birth partner. In early 2009, Rhys became annoyed because Josh does not spend time with him anymore and is constantly with Amy. He occasionally stays over with her. However, their relationship is suffering a little bit because he is spending a lot of time doing band stuff and is beginning to neglect her. Ste sees this as an opportunity to get back with Amy. Josh then meets a lesbian called Lydia who Amy doesn't like, prompting them to have an argument. After Amy gives birth she runs away telling Josh its over. In April 2009, after Josh and Amy broke up Rhys tried to cheer him up by proposing to make a new band for them to play in. A few days later they tried to get a demo CD on the student radio station but Kris Fisher asked them if they could play live instead. It was then that they realised their band didn't have a name so Kris gave them the name The Somethings. After that Kris became the bands agent and said they needed a female lead singer and so put a competition called Voice Idol on the student radio he runs, where women send in voice clips of them singing then the band decided which on they liked the best. However, the one they wanted had sent in their voice clip anonymously. Later that week they were in Kris's flat talking when they heard singing coming from one of the bedrooms which was just like the singing from the voice clip. They believed it Zoe but it actually turned out to be Hayley Ramsey. Hayley then became their lead singer but not after Rhys made a fuss and tried to put up Lydia as the lead singer who turned out to be a not very good singer. After a lot of complaints and comments about Hayley being in a wheelchair and them losing fans because of that, Hayley gave Josh an ultimatum ; he kicks Rhys out or she leaves. Though Josh felt very guilty about it he kicked Rhys out remarking that they can replace a drummer much more easily than they could replace singer like Hayley. Lydia became the drummer for the something however things did not work out because Lydia had other commitments Josh re appointed Rhys as the new drummer much to Hayleys dismay. Hayley and Rhys spent most of their time arguing until they left alone one rehearsal and ended up kissing, They soon became a couple. The band however later collapsed because Josh sacked Haley because she couldn't dance due to her being in a wheelchair and Micheala became the new lead singer no one would sign them because of Josh's bigotry. In Hollyoaks: The Morning After The Night Before, which followed Josh going to Manchester with Dave Colburn. He was introduced to Dave's friends Gabby and Pippa and fell for guitar playing Ruby, however ended up sleeping with Gabby. Josh discovered Gabby had given him pubic lice. Gilly and Sasha Valentine also turned up to party in Manchester. Eventually, Josh and Gilly got into a fight which led to Gilly falling down stairs and losing his teeth. Josh then drunkenly slept with Sasha after she had a fight with Gabby the next day Sasha refuses to talk to him and Rhys comes to take Josh home. Once back in Hollyoaks Sasha and Josh make up before she goes to visit her brother Sonny. Josh and Rhys's girlfriend Hayley spent the day together devising pub quiz questions, and, after drinking some wine, they shared a brief kiss but Josh pulled away quickly, asking \\"What are we doing?\\". Cheryl Brady walked in at the same time and agreed with the statement. Hayley was prepared to dump Rhys for Josh but Josh felt guilty when his brother spoke about how much he liked her. Hayley still dumped Rhys and was jealous when Josh flirted with new student India Longford. Rhys and Hayley rekindle shortly and when Josh appeared to be jealous, Hayley dumped Rhys for a second time. Josh then began to develop feelings for India and after sharing a kiss at the students Christmas party, they started going out. During a night out at the loft, Rhys spikes Josh's orange juice with vodka. Josh and India decide to move on to another party along with Dave and Sasha, however Josh, unaware that his drink has been spiked, badly crashes the car. India is left unconscious by the crash and is rushed to hospital fighting for her life as Josh is arrested by the police for drink driving. Josh got a suspended sentence, his license revoked, and for 6 months he is instructed to go to AA meetings. Josh is forced to live with Ste and Amy while everyone turns their backs on him. When Suzanne realises how messed up he is she insists he moves back home which causes arguments with Neville who has disowned him. On one occasion on Suzanne's birthday dinner, Josh refuses to do as Neville tells him and this led Josh to punch him. As a consequence, Neville decides that Josh needs to learn some discipline, so decides to report him to the police, much to everyone disbelief. Josh crashes another car whilst drunk, Neville refuses to visit him in hospital but he eventually has a change of heart and has a heart to heart with Josh. India, Dave and Charlotte also forgive him when they find out he is in hospital. Josh was sentenced to prison for his second drink driving offence. When Josh is released from prison he is shocked to find his family living apart due to his mother Suzanne's affair with Darren Osborne which Neville blames Josh for. Suzanne eventually got Neville to forgive her on the condition they emigrate to Spain. Neville also reveals that Josh is not invited to come. The guilt eventually becomes too much for Rhys who confesses to spiking Josh's drink. After some initial anger Josh decides to forgive Rhys as he'll always have to live with the guilt. Neville and Suzanne agree to take Josh with them to Spain. Two years later Josh goes for a drink with Amy, Michaela and Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest). He reveals that he is engaged to someone, has a new flat and studying a new university course. He offers Amy relationship advice and then goes. Josh returned on 31 August 2012 for the departure of Michaela and left with her to go touring.

Background Jordan, a former barber, was linked to the deaths of between eight and ten women between 1965 and 1988; he was the first Canadian known to use alcohol as a murder weapon. Jordan's lengthy criminal record started in 1952 and includes convictions for rape, indecent assault, abduction, hit and run, drunk driving and car theft.CBC: Boozing Barber: http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/08/31/bc_jordan000831.htmlCTV: Boozing Barber: http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1092327960246_87737160R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.J. No. 2908 In 1976, Jordan was examined by Dr. Tibor Bezeredi as part of a court proceeding. Bezeredi diagnosed Jordan as having an antisocial personality, defined by Bezeredi as \\"a person whose conduct is maladjusted in terms of social behaviour; disregard for the rights of others which often results in unlawful activities\\".Quoted in the court decision, R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.C.A. CA010272 Killings Jordan is thought to have begun serial killing in 1965. He is considered a serial killer as he was linked to the deaths of between eight and ten women, but was only convicted in the manslaughter death of one woman.Justice Canada. Technical Report.

(Ottawa: Department of Justice Canada, 1995), online: http://24.85.225.7/lowman_prostitution/HTML/violence/Violence_Against_Persons_Who_Prostitute.pdf. His victims were Aboriginal women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Typically he would find women in bars, and buy them drinks, or pay them for sex and encourage them to drink with him. When they passed out, he would pour liquor down their throats.National Post: History of Serial Killers: http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2007/12/12/a-sordid- history-of-canadian-killers.aspx The resulting deaths were reported as alcohol poisoning and police paid little attention, because some of his victims suffered from alcoholism. Although the newspapers often described the women as sex workers, not all were involved in sex work. Jordan was known for drinking more than 50 ounces of vodka each day. The first woman known to have died by alcohol poisoning while in Jordan's company was in 1965. As would become a pattern, a switchboard operator named Ivy Rose was found naked and dead in a Vancouver hotel. Her blood alcohol level was 0.51. No charges were laid.First Nations Drum: http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/2009/april/gpj.html Court proceedings show \\"he sought out approximately 200 women per year for binge- drinking episodes covering the period from 1980 to 1988. He was also looking for sexual gratification.\\" Further, the Crown provided evidence that Jordan was linked to the deaths of six other Aboriginal women. Similar fact evidence showed Jordan had been with the following women at the time of their deaths:R. v. Jordan [1988] B.C.J. No. 1927 *Mary Johnson, November 30, 1980, at the Aylmer Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .34 *Barbara Paul, September 11, 1981, at the Glenaird Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .41 *Mary Johns, July 30, 1982, at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .76 *Patricia Thomas, December 15, 1984, at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .51 *Patricia Andrew, June 28, 1985, at 2503 Kingsway (his barbershop) Blood alcohol level: .79 *Vera Harry, November 19, 1986, at the Clifton Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .04 Investigation On October 12, 1987, Vanessa Lee Buckner was found naked on the floor of the Niagara Hotel after a night of drinking with Jordan.R. v. Jordan [2003] B.C.J. No. 237 There is some debate regarding the victim. Some sources indicate that she was a white woman, not a heavy drinker, nor was she a sex worker. However, official court records describe Buckner's death as the result of Jordan \\"supplying a lethal amount of liquor to a female alcoholic, who died as a result\\".R. v. Jordan [2002] BCCA 330 Buckner had recently lost custody of her newborn baby, who had been born with a drug dependency. She \\"was an alcoholic and a taker of various kinds of drugs.\\" Jordan's fingerprints were found and linked to Buckner's death. A month after her death, another woman, Edna Shade, was found dead in another hotel. After being questioned, Jordan had not been charged with any crime related to Buckner's death. However, police initiated surveillance on Jordan. Between October 12 and November 26, 1987, police watched him \\"search out native Indian women in the skid row area of Vancouver. On four different occasions they [the police] rescued the woman involved before she too became a victim\\". Those women were: *Rosemary Wilson, November 20, 1987, at the Balmoral Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .52 *Verna Chartrand, November 21, 1987, at the Pacific Hotel, Blood alcohol level: .43 *Sheila Joe, November 25, 1987, at the Rainbow Hotel, Blood alcohol level: unknown *Mabel Olson, November 26, 1987, at the Pacific Hotel, Blood alcohol level: unknown According to the court records, police listening outside the hotel rooms heard Jordan say such things as: \\"Have a drink, down the hatch baby, 20 bucks if you drink it right down; see if you're a real woman; finish that drink, finish that drink, down the hatch hurry, right down; you need another drink, I'll give you 50 bucks if you can take it; I'll give you 10, 20, 50 dollars, whatever you want, come on I want to see you get it all down; you get it right down, I'll give you the 50 bucks and the 13 bucks; I'll give you 50 bucks. I told you that. If you finish that I'll give you $75; finish your drink, I'll give you $20 ...\\" Convictions and arrests This similar fact evidence was important in the 1988 trial. Jordan was tried before a judge alone. Justice Bouck found Jordan guilty of manslaughter in the death of Buckner. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, but that was reduced to nine years on appeal.R. v. Jordan [1991] B.C.J. No. 3490 Jordan served six years for the manslaughter conviction. After his release, he was placed on probation which restricted him to Vancouver Island. In June 2000, he had been charged with sexual assault, assault, negligence causing bodily harm and administering a noxious substance‚Äîalcohol.GPJ: http://members.shaw.ca/pdg/gilbert-paul-jordan.html In 2000, Jordan attempted to change his name to Paul Pearce.CBC: Name change: http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/12/27/names011227.html At the time, a name change in British Columbia did not require fingerprinting or a criminal check. After the loophole was closed, he dropped the application. Jordan was arrested again, in 2002 for breach of probation because he was found drinking, and in the presence of a woman while in possession of alcohol. He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in jail, followed by three years' probation and strict conditions. However, on August 11, 2004, he was arrested in Winnipeg for violating that probation order for an incident at the York Hotel in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, August 9, 2004. He had been identified as being a party to binge drinking with Barb Burkley. Burkley was a long term resident of the hotel and had a serious drinking problem. Burkley was taken to the hospital by her friend and hotel employee, Cathy Waddington, after finding Burkley in very bad condition. Waddington identified Jordan as being there, but he was acquitted of those charges in 2005.R. v.

Cultural impact Jordan was the subject of the 1997 Canadian television program Exhibit A: Secrets of Forensic Science in an episode called \\"Dead Drunk\\". The program described the forensic work used to convict him in 1988.Exhibit A: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0574359/ A dramatization, The Unnatural and Accidental Women was written by Vancouver playwright Marie Clements and performed in, among other places, Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto (2004). In the play, the writer focused on the story of the victims in an attempt to redress the failure of the news media to do so. Clements later adapted her play into the screenplay for the feature film Unnatural & Accidental which premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.Unnatural & Accidental: Jordan and his crimes served as inspiration for the first several episodes of Da Vinci's Inquest. The crime series, set in Vancouver, portrayed a serial killer using alcohol as a murder weapon and stalking women involved in sex work. The portrayal departed from the facts by having the killer die before he could be arrested; he was murdered by one of his victims' brother, tipped to his identity by a detective.Da Vinci's Inquest: http://www.davincisinquest.com/ See also *Robert Pickton  References  =Further reading= * Marie Clements, The Unnatural and Accidental Women, 2005, Talon Books. * The Vancouver Sun Special Report, \\"Death by Alcohol\\", October, 1987 pp. A1‚ÄìA13. * Chris Rose, \\"Alcohol defense a surprise, man says\\", The Vancouver Sun, Oct. 20, 1988, p.

Carrie is intelligent and will usually act as though she is naive or unaware of what is going on in her children's lives, whilst she is really picking up more than she lets on. She only becomes involved when she feels it is absolutely necessary and tends to let her views go unnoticed much of the time. Storylines Carrie arrived in Hollyoaks with her children Sam, Russ and Nicole and had a whole mystery to her family. Eventually, it was revealed that Carrie and her family had to move homes because of Sam having been in prison for three years due to setting a house on fire, a crime that he never committed. Later on, Carrie‚Äôs husband, Rob, arrived in the village and wanted to make up with his family after they had a fall out over Sam‚Äôs innocence. Carrie decided to allow Rob to move back in with the family and slowly Carrie and Rob got back together. Although Carrie may seem over protected over her children, she always had their best interests but sometimes it worked against her. Russ had testicular cancer and wanted to cope with the situation by himself, however after eventually he confessed to his mother, she supported Russ through his ordeal. However, Carrie and family‚Äôs world was to turn upside down when Sam confessed that he has been spiking and raping girls. With little choice, Carrie and her family forced Sam to turn himself to the police and as he finally did, it was too devastating for Carrie. Sam was sentenced for 25 years, which left Carrie heartbroken and even further more when Sam told her that he no longer wanted prison visits. Six months down the line, Sam escaped from prison and this time the effects were to be horrendous. He burnt down the local pub The Dog in The Pond which left several people dead (including Sam himself). Carrie throw herself into the household chores and organised Sam's funeral. Both Nicole and Russ refused to go to the funeral and Carrie was left shattered by this. With Nicole being bullied and the Owen family receiving abuse from the minority residents of Hollyoaks, Carrie decided it was the best for her and her family to move away from Hollyoaks. Carrie, Rob and Nicole left the village behind except Russ as he wanted to stay with girlfriend Mercedes McQueen. Nicole returned to give evidence at Becca's trial and for Russ's wedding but neither Carrie or Rob have ever returned to Hollyoaks. In 2018, Mercedes went to stay with Rob and Carrie for a while before going to Spain after giving her son Bobby to Cleo to hide him from Carl. She later mentioned that the couple move on from their past and forgive her for her affair with Warren and accept her to relationship with Russ once again.

Storylines In August 2004 the Owen family arrive when they move to the Village. It soon emerges his real name is Sam Owen, but he is using a false name following his conviction for burning down his former girlfriend Jules' home; her younger brother had died in the fire. Jules had blamed him and her father for telling her to abort the baby she had conceived with Sam. The whole village turns against Sam following this revelation; Tony Hutchinson even questions keeping Sam on at Il Gnosh, where he works as a waiter. It eventually emerges that Sam is innocent of the charge and that the real arsonist is his girlfriend's father, who had set fire to the house as part of an insurance scam. For a long time he feels let down by his father Rob for not believing in him and tries to lead a clean-cut lifestyle because he feels that he had something to prove. In part to redeem his reputation, Sam begins studying law at Hollyoaks Community College although his criminal record would make it impossible for him to practice. Sam passes his exams with flying colours, and is offered a work experience placement with a top law firm. At HCC, he attracts the attention of fellow student Zara Morgan. Sam even proves himself somewhat of a hero by saving Cameron Clark from a suicide attempt. Sam is a part of daredevil group at college, where he meets his old friend Andy Holt. Sam decides to study law at Hollyoaks Community College but this does not last long. In the late-night special Hollyoaks: Crossing The Line, he becomes a rapist, after being tempted by Andy, who revealed that he had raped Russ's girlfriend Dannii Carbone by using GHB (but tells him he does not know she was Russ' girlfriend until after). Andy convinces Sam that the drug is a short cut to sex from girls who are \\"gagging for it\\". Sam is disgusted with Andy when he finds out he raped and drugged the twins Sophie and Mel Burton. Andy chooses Mel and \\"gives\\" Sophie to Sam as a \\"present\\"; Sam ultimately cannot go through with it, however. Unaware that Sam had been there on the night of her sister's rape, Sam and Sophie begin going out. Sam's refusal to rape Sophie results in Andy taking Sam to a cliff. Sam thinks they are going for another 'This way up' challenge, but Andy confronts Sam about not raping Sophie. Meanwhile, Dannii tells Russ that Andy raped her, and he goes looking for Sam. Russ eventually finds Sam and Andy, and a fight breaks out. The fight ends after Andy falls off the cliff and into the lake (presumably drowning). In a series of late night episodes, Andy returns to continue his assault on the Owens. When he kidnaps Nicole Owen, he lures Russ and Sam to an abandoned warehouse. When they get there Andy attacks them with a metal pole. Andy then reveals to both Nicole and Russ that Sam was also involved in the rapes. They are both shocked and disgusted. After Andy is killed. Russ and Nicole refuse to speak to Sam. After Sam confesses to his parents, they gave him the chance to turn himself in. Sam tells them he needs to say goodbye to Sophie and he confesses to her his involvement in the rapes. Sophie then tricks Sam into turning himself in to the police. Although Sam recants his confession, he is convicted of raping unidentified girls and is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He tells his parents not to visit him. Four months later he begins writing to Nicole and sending her visiting orders, begging for forgiveness from his sister.

In retrospect, the case reflected day care sex abuse hysteria, including allegations of satanic ritual abuse. The testimony of the children was coached. In January 1989, allegations were made by a woman that Bob Kelly had sexually abused her child. After investigation by a police officer and social worker, the conclusion was the allegations were valid and parents were urged by the authorities to have their children evaluated for abuse. A total of 90 children, after many therapy sessions (in some cases as much as ten months' worth), also made allegations resulting in accusations against dozens of people besides Kelly and charges against seven adults (Bob and Betsy Kelly, three workers at the day care, a worker at a local Head Start facility, and the son of a judge). The charges ultimately included rape, sodomy and fellatio, and publicized allegations included the murder of babies, torture and being thrown into a school of sharks. During the trial, children were asked to testify about events that had occurred three years previously, with memories \\"refreshed\\" by therapy sessions, meetings with the prosecution and repeated discussions with their parents. While the alleged abuse was occurring, no parents noticed anything unusual about their children's behavior to indicate abuse or torture. The eight-month trial against Bob Kelly was the most expensive in North Carolina history, ending in conviction on 99 of 100 charges and twelve consecutive life sentences. On May 2, 1995 all convictions were reversed by the Court of Appeals. The remaining six defendants were charged with a mixture of charges ending in a variety of sentences from life imprisonment to seven years. Accusation The Little Rascals Day Care Center was managed by Betsy Kelly, with help from her part-time plumber and golf pro husband, Bob. In January 1989, a parent accused Bob Kelly of abusing her son at Little Rascals. The allegations were investigated by police officer Brenda Toppin and members of the Department of Social Services. In February, three additional children made accusations, and Kelly was arrested in April 1989, charged with child sexual abuse. The police department suggested to local parents that they have their children assessed for possible abuse, and provided a list of recommended therapists. After repeated questioning by police and their parents, a small number of children made disclosures of abuse; other children made disclosures only after long periods of therapy, some lasting as much as ten months. Ultimately a total of 90 children made allegations of physical and sexual abuse, which was claimed to have occurred between September and December of 1988. The allegations were made against dozens of people in the town, but ultimately seven were arrested: Bob Kelly in April and six others in September 1989. These included Betsy Kelly; the day care facilities' cook (Dawn Wilson) and two teachers (Robin Byrum and Shelly Stone); Scott Privott, the son of a local judge, owner of a video store and personal friend of Bob Kelly; and Darlene Harris, who managed a nearby Head Start Program facility. The trial was relocated 60 miles away from Edenton due to difficulties in finding an unbiased jury. Defense attorneys claimed they were hampered in preparation of their case due to lack of access to files and the child witnesses, as well as the extensive preparation of the children by the prosecuting attorneys. Trial The trial was relocated from Edenton to Farmville due to local publicity. \\"The attention became national...May (1991) with the broadcasting of a documentary, 'Innocence Lost,' as part of the PBS series Frontline, which suggested that abuse of the extent alleged by the state was impossible.\\" In March 1992, \\"Mr. Kelly, 43 years old, (was) facing 100 charges of sexually abusing a dozen children in 1988 and 1989 at the Little Rascals Day Care Center...Originally there were 248 charges involving 22 children, but the prosecution had withdrawn many charges while Judge D. Marsh McLelland...ha(d) dismissed others.\\" \\"The assistant district attorney said, \\"their reactions fit the pattern of a traumatized child. They are a consistent picture that paints abuse.\\" =Robert Kelly= Each defendant was tried separately, with Robert Kelly the first to be tried. Testimony lasted nine months with 12 children providing descriptions of sexual and physical abuse: babies ritualistically killed, victims taken out on boats and thrown overboard, and inappropriate trips in hot air balloons. In April 1992, \\"Robert Kelly Jr. was convicted of 99 of 100 counts of rape and related crimes against children.\\" One of the mothers of the 12 children that testified against Kelly stated that she felt \\"overwhelming relief.\\" The six other defendants, including Kelly's wife, had trials later. The jury believed the children on the witness stand. One juror stated \\"the children were convincing\\". Kelly and his supporters maintained that he was innocent. Kelly was convicted and sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms in prison. The trial \\"included 83 prosecution witnesses and 60 defense witnesses\\". The children had testified that Kelly had forced them to have different types of sex. The parents testified that the children exhibited abnormal behavior. \\"Twelve children, between the ages of 4 and 7, testified, and the results of physical and psychological tests of them were presented as evidence.\\" =Dawn Wilson= Dawn Wilson, the daycare center's cook and one of the accused, refused all plea bargains and elected to stand trial. During her trial, four children testified against her. After deliberation, the jury convicted her and she was sentenced to life in prison. =Betsy Kelly= In January 1994, Betsy Kelly had been in prison for two years awaiting trial. She accepted a plea of \\"no contest,\\" and a sentence of seven years in prison. She served an additional year in prison and was released in 1995. Case reversed Six months after Betsy Kelly's release, the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of both Robert Kelly and Dawn Wilson, stating that there were legal errors by the prosecution. On May 23, 1997, the prosecution dismissed all charges related to the Little Rascals case against the two. The others The state dismissed its charges against Shelly Stone, Darlene Harris and Robin Byrum. Byrum had by then spent one year in prison awaiting trial. After serving three years in jail, Scott Privott had his bond reduced from $1 million to $50,000, and he was released on bond. Rather than face a trial, Scott Privott accepted a \\"no contest\\" plea.  Scholarly explanations  Scholars have proposed that these accusations were part of a broader phenomenon, a general fear or hysteria called Satanic Panic. Other day care staff were similarly accused of committing acts of violence against children during the 1980s and 1990s, and many accusations involved Satanism.Twiddy, Anna. ‚ÄúThe Little Rascals Case: A Case for Regulating Children‚Äôs Testimony.‚Äù People, Ideas and Things, 2016, https://pitjournal.unc.edu/article/little- rascals-case-case-regulating-children%E2%80%99s-testimony.

First appearing in 2004, Janson left the soap on 25 September 2006, making a brief return on 10 July 2007 until she left again on 13 July 2007. In 2019, it was confirmed that Nicole would be returning for her nephew, Max McQueen. Storylines =2004‚Äì2007= Nicole's family had been split when her brother Sam was falsely arrested and convicted for an arson which had killed his girlfriend's younger brother. Their father, Rob, had refused to believe Sam's innocence, and their mother Carrie banished him from their lives. After Russ found out he had testicular cancer, he wanted to contact Rob. They met, and Nicole and Russ began insisting Rob would not be allowed to become part of the family again. After several visits, Rob and Carrie reconciled. Nicole was thrilled, although she wasn't happy about having another parent trying to tell her what to do. Nicole pined for Justin Burton, not realising his stepbrother and her close friend Ali Taylor had feelings for her. Nicole became infatuated with Connor, an Irish traveller who was staying in the village. Connor kissed Nicole on her brother Sam's birthday. the birthday dinner and tried to get her attention. Nicole dismissed him as a puppy, which helped cause a dejected Ali into confronting Stephen \\"Macki\\" Mackintosh with a knife. Ali killed Macki in self-defence and was then run over by a car while fleeing the scene. Justin, who had also been at the scene and took the knife, was arrested for Macki's murder. Around this time she also befriended Nancy Hayton, who was more experienced and encouraged Nicole to lose her virginity. Nancy let Nicole use her sister Becca's flat, but when the time came, Nicole was unsure and Connor didn't want to push her. Nicole ran out in shame. The next day, she wanted to try again, but Connor was leaving town with his family. Before driving away, he kissed Nicole and told her he would always love her, but didn't maintain contact. Nicole returned to her feelings for Justin. When Justin escaped from prison, Nicole went on the run with him and later gave evidence in his favour at his trial. In the late night special Hollyoaks: Back from the Dead, Nicole went on a trip with Andy Holt, the serial rapist, as part of a trap for her brothers Sam and Russ Owen. At first he charmed her into thinking he had feelings for her, and nearly made love to her, only to stop because he claimed he wanted her to be better. By the time Nicole realised his true intentions for her, he wouldn't let her leave. Andy forced Nicole to drink the Date rape drug GHB rendering her unconscious. Andy then took her to a warehouse, where he tied and gagged her, before texting pictures of her to Sam to draw them in. Nicole and her brothers were eventually rescued by a vengeful Mel Burton, who pursued the fleeing Andy. Fleeing into the unlit basement, Andy accidentally impaled himself on a spike. Nicole was disgusted when she found out Sam had also been a rapist, and vowed never to speak to him again. Sam contacted Nicole and she visited him in prison. It was, however, a deception. Sam escaped using her as leverage, and later held his younger sister hostage in the family home and tied her up. After a failed escape attempt, Sam threatened to pour boiling water over Nicole if she didn't tell him where Sophie was. Russ came home and found Nicole, who told him what had happened. Russ raced to The Dog in The Pond but arrived too late - several people were dead, including Russ's girlfriend Sophie. Nicole and Russ both later refused to attend Sam's funeral. Nicole eventually reversed her decision and attended, seeing her parents as the only others there. She sat at the back, emotionless, gave her mother a comforting hand and told her she was sorry her son had died. In a fury born of abject ignorance, Nicole's peers turned on her because of Sam's crimes. Her groceries were smashed on her way home; a dead rat was stuffed into her school locker. After Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Wayne Tunnicliffe (Joe Marsden) got her drunk with the intent to sleep with her, Nicole decided that enough was enough, and promptly left Hollyoaks with her parents. When her friends Nancy, Sarah and Hannah, who had avoided her after the pub explosion, asked her if she would stay in contact with them, Nicole answered simply 'No'. Nicole returned in December 2006 for Becca Dean's (Ali Bastian) trial where she gave evidence against Becca-much to the annoyance of her supposed friend Nancy. She claimed Justin's stepbrother Ali Taylor (Luti Fagbenle) had told her in 2005 (when Justin was 15) that Becca and Justin were involved. This was hearsay, but still played crucial to the prosecution's case. Becca was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to prison, where she was later killed by another prisoner. Nicole returned in 2007 for the wedding of Mercedes McQueen and Russ, where she begged her brother to reconsider his choice of bride. =2019= Nicole later returns in 2019 after receiving a call from her nephew, Max, saying that Mercedes doesn't love him and he wants to stay with her in Greece. Mercedes had married Sylver McQueen (David Tag) following Russ' death. After having a catch-up with Nancy, Nicole goes to The Dog to retrieve Max from Mercedes. She refuses, but snaps at Breda McQueen (Moya Brady), saying that she loves her son Bobby Costello (Jayden Fox) more than Max, which he overhears. Breda tells him to leave with Nicole, believing it's the best thing for him, which he does, saying he wishes Russ had never met Mercedes. In July 2019, Nicole brings Max back to the village where Mercedes, Sylver, Breda and Nana McQueen (Diane Langton) organised a party for him. Mercedes ruined the party after taking cocaine which Liam Donovan (Jude Monk McGown) supplied to her. Max and Nicole left and boarded the next flight back to Greece.

She debuted on-screen on 7 October 1996 and has been involved in such storylines including dealing with sexual abuse while she was a child by her father Dennis (David McAllister) and numerous failed relationships, the suicide of her brother Lewis, an on and off relationship with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) before the couple married. Mandy and Tony had a daughter together who they named Grace, only for her to die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This led to the character and Dunn's exit from the serial in 2006. Dunn made a brief return in 2007 before making a return for six months in 2008. Dunn again returned as Mandy in 2010 in a storyline which also saw the return of Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). In September 2011, Dunn announced her departure from the show and Mandy made her last appearance on 2 September 2011 before departing off-screen.

Casting and creation Sarah Jayne Dunn (pictured) plays Mandy. Sarah Jayne Dunn was cast in 1996 as Mandy, a member of the Richardson family. Dunn told K9 magazine that she began her role aged fourteen and got an audition for the role through her agent. Once she had won the role her \\"contract just kept getting renewed\\". Initially Dunn was only contracted to appear in \\"a handful of episodes\\" but due to her performance impressing producers her contract was renewed. In May 2006 it was reported that Dunn had decided to leave the serial. This was later denied with a show source telling Digital Spy that an exit had not been confirmed. Dunn's exit was later confirmed. Explaining her decision to leave, Dunn said: \\"I was at Hollyoaks for 10 years and I always knew I would know when I was ready to leave [...] I probably decided I wanted to leave a couple of years before I did but with the storylines it took another two years. By then, I had completely made up my mind. If I didn't move on then I would never have left\\". The actress also revealed that she told producers she did not want Mandy to be killed off as she felt it would have been \\"ridiculous\\" due to the deaths a large number of her on-screen family. In 2007, a Hollyoaks source confirmed Dunn had returned to the serial to film Becca Dean's (Ali Bastian) funeral and that during the return Dunn made \\"such an impact, it would be great to have her back again\\". In 2008, Dunn signed a 6-month contract to return to the soap. Speaking of her return, Dunn stated: \\"I always said 'never say never' so it was nice not to be killed off\\". She later expressed her feelings towards returning: \\"I felt a bit like the new girl on the first day but within an hour it was as if I'd been there ages. I actually asked to come back. It seemed the right time for my character\\". Dunn explained that although Mandy had previously made guest returns for Max's funeral and wedding, she \\"wanted to return and re-establish the character rather than just dip in and out. I've worked quite a lot since and can bring that experience to Mandy, who has changed a lot. I am contracted for six months which means I'll be on-screen until the end of the year ‚Äî who knows what will happen after that\\". Series producer Bryan Kirkwood was responsible for reintroducing Mandy and explained that he felt it \\"was an important time to bring in some old faces\\". Dunn left the role at the end of her six-month contract. In 2009, it was rumoured that Dunn could make a possible return to the soap for the exit of Jamie Lomas, who plays Warren Fox. In September 2010, Dunn stated on her Twitter account that she would be returning to Hollyoaks in 2010. It was confirmed on the official Hollyoaks website that she would return on 26 October 2010. Speaking of her return, Dunn stated: \\"I'm really excited about being a part of the show again and about the storylines that producer Paul Marquess and the rest of the team have in the pipeline for Mandy\\". Dunn also praised her return storyline, which featured a more edgy side to Mandy, saying: \\"At the moment she's come back and she's causing loads of trouble. It's quite nice because they put a different spin on the character\\". She explained that when she was asked to return her return storyline was outlined, which she felt was \\"brilliant\\" and \\"totally unexpected\\". In September 2011, Dunn revealed she had left Hollyoaks and had already finished filming. Dunn said she felt she had \\"taken the character as far as possible\\" and that when she had initially been \\"asked to come back on the show, I felt Mandy had a much darker side to her. The writers gave me some fantastic storylines [...] and I really had something to get my teeth into\\". On a future return, Dunn said she would \\"always come back if the storylines are strong enough\\". Development =Characterisation= Dunn said she does not have \\"much in common with Mandy. She is really confident and is outgoing. She is opinionated, but I'm more laid back and not quite as bossy [...] I wouldn't go over to a fella and start chatting him up, whereas Mandy would. She is a bit of a flirt and, if she wants a fella, she will go out of her way to get him\\". Dunn added that Mandy is \\"a bit confrontational and a bit heartless\\". A writer for E4's official Hollyoaks website described Mandy by saying \\"do not leave your man lying around when Mandy Richardson is in the vicinity\\" and labelling her a \\"scarlet woman\\". They added that Mandy is \\"not just about the illicit stuff though\\". The Mirror described her as the \\"whiny, but strangely also rather loveable Mandy\\". Virgin Media profiled Mandy, saying \\"Mandy never had it easy\\". Of her personality, they stated: \\"a bit of a bossy boots with a domineering personality, she has gone through varying degrees of popularity throughout her Hollyoaks life but has undoubtedly also been put through the mill\\". John Dingwall of the Daily Record described Mandy as a \\"sex kitten\\", a \\"teenage temptress\\", \\"predatory\\", as having \\"a reputation as a maneater\\" and \\"bitchy\\". =Abuse= It is revealed that Mandy's father Dennis (David McAllister) had sexually and physically abused Mandy when she was younger. Dunn noted that in the scripts she realised \\"weird\\" events happening surrounding Mandy happening before she was told that Mandy would become involved in a child abuse storyline. Due to Dunn's young age while portraying the storyline she had to give permission and have parental permission to portray the abuse storyline. Dunn stated that she carried out research into the subject before filming the storyline. Dunn praised McAllister, crediting him for making the scenes realistic, saying he \\"was so believable that I was genuinely scared in the scenes. He would be vicious and just grab hold of me, and all of the fear from me would be real\\".Evans 2002, p.76-77. Mandy runs away from home. Dennis and her brother Lewis Richardson (Ben Hull) track her down, working in a \\"seedy\\" Soho lap dancing club. Dunn explained that when Mandy sees Dennis she \\"can't believe it. It's what she's been dreading since she ran away - the one person she dislikes most in the world turning up on her doorstep\\". The actress explained Mandy is \\"terrified and just wants to get away from him as quickly as she can. She can't face the hurt again\\". While filming the scenes, Dunn and other cast members visited real lap dancing clubs. Dunn felt that this made the scenes \\"look really convincing\\". =Relationship with Tony Hutchinson= Mandy begins a relationship with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). Dunn said that when she was first informed of the storyline she was surprised due to the age gap between the characters. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, \\"it did actually work\\". Tony's ex-girlfriend Ruth Osborne (Terri Dwyer) returns. Mandy becomes jealous when Ruth and Tony spend time together. Mandy deliberately stands Tony up, leaving him alone with Ruth but \\"Tony doesn't do anything because he loves Mandy\\". Dwyer explained that when Tony discovers what Mandy has done he \\"can't believe that she didn't trust him; and begins to wonder whether their relationship is as good as he thinks it is\\". Ruth and Tony sleep together leaving Tony feeling guilty. Tony tells Mandy, who admits she has also cheated on him, and the couple continue their relationship. Following her mother's death and becoming Tom's guardian, Mandy \\"struggles with her temper\\". Mandy discovers she is pregnant and \\"Tony proves his commitment\\" to her. Dunn explained that Mandy is \\"certainly shocked\\" by her pregnancy but due to the recent events the pregnancy could \\"push her over the edge\\". Dunn revealed that viewers \\"might be surprised by some of the things she does over the next few months\\". Mandy becomes violent towards Tony and the couple decide to have a termination. The following year, the couple marry and Mandy becomes pregnant again. Dunn said that Mandy has \\"grown up a lot since she was pregnant the first time\\". She explained that \\"Tony presumes Mandy is going to want a termination after her violent reaction to becoming pregnant last year. But things are different now - she's married, they've got a nice flat and she's been bonding properly with her little brother, Tom\\". Tony books a vasectomy so that the couple will not have the problem again. Dunn felt that Tony is \\"trying to be a doting husband, he adores Mandy and wants her to realise that the most important thing to him is being with her\\". This leads Mandy to believe Tony does not want the baby so she books a termination. The actress expressed that Mandy and Tony would \\"be surprised at how they both feel. They've finally learned to love each other and the relationship has grown stronger, so maybe they've got a real chance of building a happy family together\\". Mandy and Tony realise they both want the baby so she does not go through with the termination. Mandy gives birth to a daughter, who the couple name Grace Hutchinson. Mandy and Tony lose Grace to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Dunn said that the \\"cot death storyline was one of my highlights on the show ‚Äì as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick and I both knew how we would play things and it worked\\". Mandy and Tony left to travel but he later returned alone. In 2010 Mandy returned, Dunn explained that \\"Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos\\". She added that this is \\"why she wants her revenge\\". She felt that this \\"is a different Mandy. I think she's having some sort of breakdown\\". Dunn explained that Mandy entered a relationship with Warren as part of her revenge and is \\"passionate about him, but he's just using her [...] She knows he's not good for her but she's in too deep now. Also he's very clever with his mind games...\\" Mandy later ends her relationship with Warren and admits to Tony that she initially wanted revenge. Tony leaves to go travelling and upon his return he has re-invented himself which Mandy is not impressed by. Pickard commented that \\"Underneath it all, Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy\\". He added that if the couple had not \\"lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened\\". On 13 September 2011, speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: \\"they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again. So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled\\". Reception Dunn has been nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Mandy. At the 2002 British Soap Awards, Dunn was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" and \\"Sexiest Female\\" awards. In 2006, she was again nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" and \\"Sexiest Female\\" awards. At the 2007 awards, Dunn was nominated for \\"Best Exit\\". The character was selected as one of the \\"top 100 British soap characters\\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by What's on TV in a feature titled \\"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\\", with readers able to vote for their favourite character. The BBC included Mandy's storyline featuring abuse at the hand of her father in the article about controversial issue led storylines tackled in soap opera and branded the plot as \\"harrowing\\". Virgin Media profiled some of Hollyoaks' \\"hottest females\\" in their opinion, of Mandy they stated: \\"Hollyoaks veteran Mandy Richardson has been strutting her stuff on the Chester cobbles for years. She's always avoided the chop but that might all change now she's dragged Warren back. You know what they say, if looks could kill\\". Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Daily Post said, of Mandy, \\"she was sexually abused by her father and held hostage by her psychotic best friend, she lost half her family in tragic circumstances and her baby in a cot death, so you could forgive Hollyoaks's Mandy Richardson if she sometimes wished a superhero would come and whisk her away\\".

After this, Tony picks up his phone and is thrilled when he is told that his cancer has been cleared.

However, Tony and Sinead end up continuing their affair and stay at a hotel together. Diane is suspicious over Tony's hotel visit and attempts to find out the truth, and when she speaks to the hotel receptionist she discovers that Tony has been having an affair. Diane is furious with Tony, therefore Tony hides the fact that the girl was Sinead in order to stop further problems. Tony then ends the affair with Sinead, and after speaking to Diane she agrees to get married again. Sinead later discovers she is pregnant. On their wedding day, Diane discovers a letter written by Sinead to her mystery lover and realises at the altar that it is addressed to Tony. She flees without explanation, but later returns to marry Tony.

Creation Tony is one of the original Hollyoaks characters introduced by Phil Redmond during 1995 after the creation of the soap opera. Pickard is the longest serving cast member in the serial's history having played Tony since the show began in 1995.Foy 2009, p.4. Pickard was cast in the role when he was nineteen years old and he relocated to Liverpool where the serial is filmed. He has said that his character gets a balance of serious and humorous storyline which he enjoys. In 2009, The Daily Star reported that Pickard had quit the role and was \\"disgusted\\" with series producer Paul Marquess following the axing of his real life brother John Pickard as Dom Reilly. Pickard later announced that he had no plans to leave the serial. Development =Characterisation= Tony was originally described as a \\"loveable geek and the sort of guy who would instantly and completely fall in love\\". He is described as the \\"oldest friend\\" of Kurt Benson (Jeremy Edwards) and \\"the anithesis of Kurt, sensitive and keen to settle down, Tony lacked Kurt's confidence with women\\".Evans 2002, p.10. An early official Hollyoaks website, Hollyoaks.com, described Tony as \\"A worrier, who lacks self- confidence but always does the decent thing\\". A more recent official Hollyoaks website describes Tony saying: \\"Tony has had what you would call \\"a colourful life\\". Quite the Romeo, he has been married TWICE. [...] On top of that there's been numerous engagements, romances and flings [...] A natural-born entrepreneur, he has built (and lost) a business empire that would make Sir Alan [Sugar] proud, encompassing burger bars, launderettes, health spas and restaurants [...] He may be down but he's certainly not out. NEVER underestimate the Hutch\\". Virgin Media profiled Tony, of his persona they state: \\"Pompous and irritating at times, Tony has also provided plenty of slapstick.\\" They also comment on his relationships, writing: \\"After inexplicably romancing some of the numerous blondes in the series, Tony's suffered enough personal tragedy to garner some sympathy.\\" What's on TV also profiled Tony stating: \\"The entrepreneur is a bit of a fuddy-duddy but he has never had any problems in the romance department. He must be the most fertile man in the village as he's got five women pregnant so far!\\" =Relationships= Early relationships Tony and Julie Matthews (Julie Buckfield) begin a relationship. The pair soon after become engaged. Explaining how Tony feels on his wedding day, Pickard said \\"Tony has a lot of nerves about the whole thing\\". He explained that this is due to Julie's parents taking over organising the wedding and because Julie has become an \\"absolute superbitch\\" in the lead up to the wedding making Tony feel \\"unsure\\" about the wedding. Tony and Ruth Osborne (Terri Dwyer) have a brief relationship before Ruth leaves Hollyoaks village. A few years later Ruth returns and tells Tony that she had become pregnant with his child but while away suffered a miscarriage. Dwyer felt Ruth didn't return to reunite with Tony but upon her return Ruth realised \\"she still cared\\" for Tony. Dwyer explained that Tony's girlfriend, Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn), begins to feel jealous when Ruth and Tony spend time together. Mandy deliberately stands Tony up, leaving him alone with Ruth but \\"Tony doesn't do anything because he loves Mandy\\". Upon Tony discovering what Mandy has done he can't believe her lack of trust in him and begins to \\"wonder whether their relationship is as good as he thinks it is\\". Dwyer said that Tony feels \\"vulnerable\\" so Ruth \\"goes in for the kill\\". Ruth and Tony sleep together leaving Tony feeling guilty. Mandy Richardson Tony and Mandy begin a relationship. Dunn said that when she was first informed of the storyline she was surprised. She added that although she felt the pairing was unlikely, \\"it did actually work\\". The pair marry and later have a child who they name Grace. Grace dies from suspected SIDS and the pair split. Pickard said \\"If they hadn't lost a child, they might have stayed together the first time round. They were really happy before that happened\\". Dunn said that the storyline worked well, saying \\"as much as it was really difficult. By that stage, Nick and I both knew how we would play things and it worked\\". Tony leaves Hollyoaks with Mandy and her daughter. Tony returns three months later without Mandy. Dunn explained the reason for Tony leaving Mandy saying: \\"Mandy told Tony she couldn't have more children and he freaked out and left her in Laos\\". Dunn revealed Mandy wanted revenge for this. In 2011 Tony leaves the village and returns three months later having reinvented himself. Pickard said despite Tony's changes \\"Tony is still the same person and he loves Mandy\\". Speaking about the couple's future, Dunn told Taryn Davies of Femalefirst: \\"they've been on and off for years and they're a great couple and I think that they make a great couple and I think it's such a shame that just as they get happy something horrendous happens again. So there's the possibility that their relationship might be re-kindled\\". Jacqui McQueen Tony's relationship with Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) was often strained by Jacqui's desire for children. Tony and Jacqui agree to adopt. Pickard commented that adoption is \\"not something [Tony] even considered until Jacqui suggested it. Now he‚Äôs really into it though. They were both heartbroken when she lost the baby and found out she can never have children. Adoption could give them the family they desperately want\\". Pickard explained that the couple love each other and do not \\"necessarily\\" need a child to seal their relationship but they want to begin a family together. Pickard stated that despite Jacqui's past, his character \\"sees some very good qualities in her\\". The actor revealed that Tony tries to stay positive that the couple will be able to adopt despite Jacqui's criminal record. When the couple are told they can not adopt, Pickard said they are \\"devastated\\". He went on to add that the couple's desire for children is \\"very strong\\" so they may go down other routes such as surrogacy. When questioned if Jacqui is the one for Tony, his portrayer stated: \\"He's committed to her and wants them to be together. They have a connection even though they‚Äôre constantly splitting up and getting back together. Jacqui could well be his Mrs Right at last\\". Pickard teased that \\"maybe [Tony] already has a child ‚Äì or maybe he‚Äôll get someone pregnant by accident...\\" He went on to add that \\"even by soap standards, Tony's had shocking luck\\". Tony and Jacqui's sister, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), have sex. Metcalfe revealed the pair are \\"appalled\\" and can't believe what has happened when they wake up. Metcalfe said that the pair don't like each other. Mercedes discovers she is pregnant with Tony's child. Mercedes feels like Tony has \\"the right to know\\" she is expecting his child. Metcalfe explained that Tony is \\"horrified! He can't get his head round the idea that she's pregnant with his child\\". Mercedes considers giving her baby to Jacqui but does not tell her Tony is the father. Mercedes decides not to go through with giving Jacqui her baby, which her portrayer explained saying: \\"She decides not to give Jacqui the baby even though Jacqui wants it. Mercedes can't cope with the fact that the baby's Tony's\\". She went on to add that Mercedes would keep the baby herself but because it is Tony's baby and because of \\"all the baggage that comes with that\\" Mercedes decides to terminate the pregnancy. Metcalfe revealed that if Jacqui discovered Tony is the father of the baby Mercedes terminated then she would \\"go a bit psycho\\". In one storyline Jacqui's sister Tina McQueen (Leah Hackett) agrees to be a surrogate mother for her child. The storyline was included to help house many lies and secrets that had previously been built up prior, including Tony's affair with Mercedes and Tina's affair with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), of which series producer Bryan Kirkwood stated there was \\"there's so much ammunition in store\\", which would eventually devastate Jacqui and Tony. Kirkwood also devised the plot to show of Pickard's skills in playing tragedy, of this he commented: \\"It'll also give Claire Cooper and Nick Pickard another opportunity to show off their acting talents. Tony and Jacqui are one of those couples that we can have fun with - but also will blow the audience away when dealing with tragedy\\". Pickard felt the relationship ended because \\"There have been so many lies and so much deceit throughout their relationship that I think Tony and Jacqui have reached burn-out as a couple. I think he still loves her. That hasn't just gone away\\". Tony meets Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) on a night out at The Loft. Tony, unaware Theresa is fifteen years old and Jacqui's cousin, has sex with Theresa. Pickard said that upon Jacqui discovering Tony's one-night stand with Theresa she \\"storms round and starts thwacking him, screaming he's slept with her 15-year-old cousin! What's worse is that Theresa is making out Tony practically raped her\\". Pickard explained that Theresa wants a relationship with Tony but Tony tells her a relationship won't happen. Pickard explained that Tony is arrested and \\"his life goes into freefall\\". Pickard went on to say that if \\"he's found guilty then he'll probably have to do time. If he's let off, I think the best thing would be for him to go away for a while to sort himself out\\". In a later storyline Tony announces his intentions to marry Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring), prompting Jacqui to try and talk Tony out of it. Cooper has stated that she believes that her character is meant to be with Tony because \\"he is the love of Jacqui's life\\" and that hearing their engagement makes Jacqui feel like she \\"has a knife in her back\\". Cooper also hopes one day that the pair will reunite stating: \\"Jacqui needs to move on right now, but ultimately I'd prefer the story to come full circle and lead back to Tony\\". Cooper also revealed that at the time she was often approached by fans asking her when the couple would reconcile. Pickard felt that Cindy was right for Tony but believed Jacqui to be the love of Tony's life. Cindy Cunningham Cindy grow close and begin a relationship. Stephanie Waring, who portrays Cindy, said the pair \\"bring out the best in each other\\". Pickard explained that when Cindy ends the relationship because he does not plan to marry her, his character is shocked that he \\"misses Cindy. They talk things through and, out of the blue, Tony proposes in jest. But Cindy goes along with it...\\" He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating him for a while. Pickard added that Cindy will \\"want to get married as soon as possible before Tony can change his mind\\". He added that Cindy is \\"acting like she genuinely loves him and he desperately wants that love\\" so he remains unsuspicious towards her and her plans to scam him. Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has \\"some feelings\\" for Tony. He felt that Tony has \\"fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to mean a lot to him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together\\". Pickard felt that if his character discovered Cindy and Darren Osborne's (Ashley Taylor Dawson) plans to scam him he would be \\"furious but also he'd be really down about it. It would upset him to think they were trying to con him but he'd be angry with himself for being so gullible\\". He added that \\"Tony thinks [Cindy would] never have agreed to marry him if Darren still meant something to her\\". Pickard explained Tony's reason for marrying Cindy saying: \\"he‚Äôs looking forward to someone not so much to fall in love with, but for more practical reasons ‚Äì so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy\\". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has \\"been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table\\". Pickard said he was \\"surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I think he wanted to just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him\\". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: \\"I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest\\". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise \\"his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home\\". Gabby Sharpe Series producer Paul Marquess said that Tony's relationship with Gabby \\"redefines Tony as one of the older characters\\". He explained that the audience would soon \\"feel we're seeing Tony in a different context\\". Tony helps Gabby when she is run over. Pickard revealed that \\"It's love at first sight for Tony\\" when sees Gabby. On how the characters meet, Oruche explained: \\"She's walking down the street minding her own business. She comes across Tony, he looks at her and says something to her but she doesn't answer him. He thinks she's rude [...] She gets hit by a car [... and] he then helps her. She's a woman lying in the gutter so he helps her. [...] he comes to the hospital to meet my children [...] Basically I have no help and I'm unconscious so he has to help me...\\" Pickard added that Gabby asks him to look after her children, Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which he takes as an indication she may feel the same. Oruche explained that while her character is hospitalised Tony and Gabby are \\"getting used to spending time with each other\\". Pickard revealed that Tony would become \\"embroiled in the drama of [Gabby's] life\\". Tony discovers Gabby, like Tony, is married but \\"like Tony, she's not happy\\". Pickard revealed that when Gabby's husband, Phil (Andonis Anthony), returns Gabby will be too scared to leave him for Tony. Oruche also spoke of Phil's return, saying that Gabby and Tony \\"want to spend their lives together but like I said the husband comes back. She's not in any fit state to go through separating with somebody\\". Tony and Gabby have a brief relationship before she leaves Hollyoaks village.

Foy went on to describe Tony as being famous for his \\"many on-screen relationships, affairs and engagements\\" but always has plenty of heartache. The Daily Star described Tony as going \\"through more women than he‚Äôs served hot meals in his restaurant Gnosh\\" before adding that he is a \\"loser-in-love\\". They commented that after dumping Cindy \\"this time he‚Äôs only got himself to blame\\". On the character Sky said: \\"Tony Hutchinson is our fave character on the show. Probably because he's been on it the whole time since it started in 1995\\". An Inside Soap critic responded negatively to a plot centring on Tony catering for the college ball saying \\"Just who do the Hollyoaks writers think they are catering for with a plot like this? Do us a favour and serve up something decent!\\" The Liverpool Echos Caroline Corcoran reviewed Hollyoaks: Movin' On saying the spinoff provided \\"an insight in to Tony's character that we don't get in Hollyoaks, and I actually found myself feeling for a character that is normally written to be deliberately irritating\\". Another critic for Inside Soap felt Hollyoaks was back to a high standard before adding that \\"Tony Hutchinson has been on fine comedy form following the disastrous transformation of his garden by 'Charlie Dimmock'\\". Inside Soaps Lucy said that \\"You've got to feel sorry for Hollyoaks's Tony Hutchinson ... Give the man a break!\\" Following Tony's relationship with Mandy becoming troubled. Lucy's colleague Sam also reviewed the storyline saying: \\"Feel sorry for Tony? Oh get over it! He deserves everything he's got coming to him. What is Mandy doing with him anyway? He's far too old, a total fuddy duddy, and has had the same naff hairstyle for seven years!\\" While reflecting on \\"some of soap's more memorable business ideas\\", an Inside Soap writer, on Tony's business ideas, said: \\"Tony Hutchinson, is not so much the king of money-making schemes - more of an old skin-flint ... he came up with the idea of recycling all his guest's used water ... When his recycling racket was discovered, his claims that it was just an innovative method of being environmentally friendly wouldn't wash - we all knew it was just his cheap-skate way of reducing his water bill! However, to this day his roses continue to bloom strangely well\\". Inside Soap critic Sam expressed disinterest in a storyline in which Tony and Ruth kiss, questioning if they have \\"gone back in time or something?\\" Merle Brown of the Daily Record bemoaned the lack of realism in Tony's storylines saying: \\"why on earth would Izzy go out with Tony? Yes, she's slightly irritating, but in the real world would a man like Tony honestly have a constant stream of girlfriends?\\" During the Enjoy The Ride storyline, Inside Soaps Sarah said \\"there are standout performances from some of my all-time favourite Hollyoaks stars\\" which she said included Pickard. Hollyoak's series producer Jo Hallows described Tony as a \\"fantastic\\" character and opined that Pickard had made the role his own. She went on to say that Tony is \\"easy to write for, because you can throw any story at him, both serious and frivolous, and you know that Nick will make a good job of it. He'll make you laugh and he'll also make you cry\\". Hallows opined that Pickard is \\"probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you know the story that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat\\".Evans 2002, p.129. Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a \\"brilliant\\" actor. He said he was \\"particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked\\". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that \\"there's only so many daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept\\". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has \\"had some great storylines\\", adding that if she was \\"half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay\\". In 2017, Pickard won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for 22 years of playing Tony. This was the first time an actor/actress from Hollyoaks had received the award.

Northeast Times Rocks also ran as a Republican for mayor in 1995, losing to incumbent Ed Rendell. Throughout his career in politics, Rocks was known as a fighter and an aggressive campaigner. His campaign against Allyson Schwartz in 1990, when he lost his State Senate seat, was particularly bitter, with negative campaigning from both sides. Among the more wild accusations was the assertion from the Schwartz campaign that Rocks had an alcohol problem and engaged in promiscuous behavior. The comments had apparently been prepared as a joke by a staffer, released accidentally, and Schwartz apologized, but the campaign became increasingly acrimonious from that point forward. After leaving politics, Rocks became the CEO of Northwestern Human Services (NHS) from 2000 to 2014.

After a year of rehearsals and writing, the band record their first demo tape, entitled Ved Ferdens Ende‚Äîshortly after, Berserk left the band. Tsjuder replaced him with drummer Torvus for their second demo tape, 1996's Possessed. The following year, Tsjuder underwent another change in its formation, with Torvus being fired, and his replacement Desecrator, along with American guitarist Diabolus Mort, recorded the Throne of the Goat EP, released through Solistitium Records in 1997. Later in 1998, both Diabolus Mort and Desecrator left the band due to \\"lack of interest\\". The full-length debut album was then planned with Blod from Gehenna on drums, and Arak Draconiiz from Isvind; who joined the band as guitarist. They then, recorded the promo Atum Nocturnem actually meant for Blod to rehearse, but indie labels had begun to pay attention to Tsjuder's \\"totally uncompromising brand of brutal, speed- addicted black metal\\" and it was eventually released by At War Records in 1999. Later that year, Tsjuder signed a deal for two albums with Drakkar Productions, and the debut album Kill for Satan was recorded. Because of time limits and that Blod was unable to join the band on the first planned tour in 2000, Christian \\"Anti-Christian\\" Svendsen joined instead on the drums. After the release of Kill for Satan, Arak Draconiiz moved away from Oslo, and was replaced by P√•l. In October 2001, Svendsen had to leave the band, because he got tendinitis in both arms. Guitarist P√•l also left the band due to his working hours. Svendsen was replaced by Jontho of Ragnarok, and this line-up recorded from December 2001 to January 2002, which became the band's second studio album Demonic Possession, which was released through Drakkar Productions in 2002. Norwegian label Mester Productions also re-released the Throne of the Goat EP on picture disc in a limited edition of 666 copies that same year. In 2003, the recovered Svendsen returned to Tsjuder, replacing the drummer Jontho. The band signed to the French label Season of Mist in April 2004, and, after striking this new deal, their third full-length Desert Northern Hell was released in November 2004. Tsjuder toured Europe with Carpathian Forest in early 2005. As of 2006 the band had split up, but reunited to play at Wacken Open Air festival in August 2011 and continued to tour afterwards. A fourth studio album, 'Legion Helvete' was released in October 2011 and a fifth, 'Antiliv', in September 2015. The band are reportedly working on a sixth album, scheduled for release in 2020, but without drummer Svendsen who left in June of the same year. Musical style and lyrical themes The music in Tsjuder is mainly written by Nag and Draugluin, citing as main musical inspirations, the black metal bands from the early 1980s and early 1990s such as Bathory, Celtic Frost, Darkthrone, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Marduk, Mayhem, and \\"old\\" thrash metal bands Destruction, Kreator, Possessed, Sepultura, Slayer, and Sodom. Tsjuder's lyrics are written prior to the music, and are based on topics such as darkness, death, evil, hatred, demons, antireligious themes, Satanism, horror films, and the fictional book Necronomicon, that appears in the stories of horror novelist H. P. Lovecraft, considered as a \\"great source of inspiration\\" by frontman Nag.

Speaking of his decision, Pickard said, \\"I've really enjoyed my time on Hollyoaks and I shall be very sad to leave, but after five years, it's definitely time to move on. I've loved working with Nick and it's been great living in the North ‚Äî Liverpool is such a great city and we've both made friends for life up here. I'll really miss the social side of this job because the people really have made it all the more fun. Dom has been such a great character to play but now I'm looking forward to taking on new roles.\\" Storylines =Backstory= The result of their father Edward having with his sister-in-law Diane, as children, Dom and Tony were raised as first cousins.
