On September 13, 2018, the series began teasing a set of commercials about a mock-cancellation by Comedy Central by using the hashtag #cancelsouthpark. Similar to the previous season, the season features continuing elements and recurring storylines without adhering to a linear story arc; while lampooning several phenomena such as school shootings in the United States, modern political correctness, climate change denial, and the working conditions and monopolistic tactics of Amazon, several characters in the show also express disdain and exasperation with South Park's constant attraction to controversy and surreal occurrences. Episodes Reception The twenty-second season of South Park received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds a 77% approval rating, stating \\"South Park recaptures its sardonic magic in a less serialized season that remains hit-or- miss in its resonance but undeniably funny no matter who it skewers\\".

While the meaning of the word Mawla can be interpreted in several ways, including as \\"friend\\" or \\"master\\", Shi'ites view it as being the latter and thus see the sermon as being the official designation of Ali as Muhammad's successor.

History  The bank was started by Dnyaneshwar Agashe in 1969. It was started to cater to the banking needs, primarily of Pune's middle class Marathi population.  2008 scam allegations  = Background = In 2004, Agashe, chairman of the Maharashtra Cricket Association at the time, was denied his right to vote in the BCCI Presidential Elections due to allegations of factionalism within the MCA. The denial to Agashe to exercise his franchise saw Sharad Pawar losing by one vote in the election for the post of the President of the BCCI. By 2006, the bank business started having financial troubles, with some sources alleging that the bank's failure was backlash for the controversial BCCI presidential elections. In September that same year, the cooperative bank was put under moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India. The board of directors for the bank was superseded soon after. In 2007, following the order of moratorium, the State Department of Cooperation appointed Mukund Ghaisas as administrator at the bank. Many of the bank's depositors held demonstrations at Agashe's Aundh residence and threatened criminal actions against the Agashe family, after which a speedy merger was promised by Agashe. Initial non performing assets totaled Rs. 125 crore, 13% against the seven per cent maximum allowable under the RBI norms. After the non-performing assets of the bank grew to more than 43%, account holders and depositors held a day long token fast to protest against the misinformation provided in regards to the alleged duped loans. In 2008, the RBI gave the bank permission to pay interest on deposits made from January to June 2008; Agashe mortgaged personal property worth Rs. 200 crore in lieu of the recovery of the deposits worth Rs. 725 crore. Hotel Ranjeet, a hotel owned by Agashe was auctioned off for the same reasons. Cosmos Bank planned to acquire the bank after it hit this roadblock with the RBI and the subsequent announcement of the proposed merger with Cosmos led to large-scale panic withdrawals by Suvarna customers. = Allegations and arrests = On 22 November 2008, Agashe along with 14 other board members was taken into judicial custody; the bank business was charged with a Rs. 436.74 crore scam allegation. The arresting police stated that the accused along with six others allegedly misused their rights and sanctioned loans mostly to firms owned by themselves and then defaulted the loans, thereby duping the depositors. The arrests were made after a complaint was filed by Rajesh Jadhavar, a special auditor with the Cooperatives Department at the Maharashtra government. The judicial magistrate remanded Agashe and the 14 other suspects to police custody, with provisions of medical assistance if required, citing the senior citizenship of a majority of the accused. The economics offenses wing of the crime branch conducted a raid of all the homes of the accused, including Agashe's Aundh home to recover Rs. 1.5 lakhs. The prosecution stated that upon discovery of the money, further interrogation of the accused was necessary and alleged that the accused had disbursed loans to people close to them by flouting RBI rules. In return, Agashe's defense counsel claimed that Agashe and his family had sold off various properties for the repayment of the loan. The defense counsel also stated that the Agashe family had extended full cooperation with the police and submitted that the family would repay another Rs. 80 crore after the issue of Suvarna's merger was settled. The defense also raised the issue of foul play, when the first information reporting of the allegations was not produced before the court three days after registering the case and further contended that the loans had been sanctioned by the bank's disbursement committee, a committee Agashe was not a member of. The bail applications filed at the time for Agashe, his wife, and his sister were subsequently rejected. While in custody, Agashe's health deteriorated and he was admitted to Sassoon Hospital on 22 December, suffering from severe diabetes and gangrene, for which he had previously been denied medical assistance. He later died of a heart attack from complications of diabetes at Sassoon Hospital on 2 January 2009. = Aftermath = Upon Agashe's death, the depositors of the bank approached Indian Overseas Bank for help after the bank's accumulated losses were estimated at over Rs. 350 crore. The bank was finally dissolved and merged with Indian Overseas Bank in 2009. The bank's case, and failure amidst a political scandal is widely cited today in the Indian banking sector.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  The valley in which Tumut is located was explored by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824, with settlers arriving later that decade. By 1852 a town existed, but the discovery of gold at Kiandra in 1859, about 80 kilometres south-east of Tumut, provided a market for Tumut's primary products, and the town began to grow. A town council was created in 1887 and a railway connection to Gundagai was opened in 1903. The area's economy was based on agriculture and later on forestry and timber. In the post-WWII period, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme also brought increased prosperity and development into Tumut. Tumut Post Office, incorporating residential quarters at first floor level, was built in 1879 by Eberlin and Hoad, to designs by the Colonial Architect, James Barnet, at a cost of ¬£2,300. The new building replaced the previous post and telegraph office which had been operating from rented premises.(Freeman Collett & Partners and Warmington and Ward) The post office was designed in conjunction with the court house and police station nearby, and is reputed to have used the same builder. Later works included alterations in 1888, and a more major upgrade in c.1904 including an internal renovation and a reworking of the front of the building.  Description  Tumut Post Office is at 82-84 Wynyard Street, Tumut, comprising the whole of Lots 1 and 2 DP33472. Tumut Post Office is on a 'wayside' site in Wynyard Street, facing north-west and next door to the Royal Hotel. It comprises an 1879 core, basically rectangular in form with the post office public area on the ground floor and the quarters above. It was nearly entirely enclosed within new fabric in 1904, in the Federation period. Externally, this included the removal of a wood shingled roof that was evidently in the 1879 design and its replacement with an asymmetrical timber roof clad in corrugated galvanised iron, and the addition of a balcony and an arcaded loggia to Wynyard Street. The Wynyard Street frontage is marked at ground level by a five-bayed arcade, enclosing a loggia behind four of its arches and having the fifth, on the frontage's right, filled in by a double stilted arched window and face brick tympanum. The arches are in dressed stucco, and the piers and spandrels are all in face brick. The loggia is terminated compositionally by a moulded string course, with a face brick parapet under the first floor balcony. The balcony only covers four of the arches, and is supplanted by a stuccoed parapet above the infilled window arch. Examination of the fabric indicates that the bricks for the stylobate entrance are a different colour to those of the loggia. Historic photographs indicate that originally there was a loggia of four arches, the fourth arch was infilled by the window form, and subsequently an additional bay was constructed and the window form was repositioned in this archway opening, after the upper level balcony was constructed. The balcony roof is integrated into the main roof, has exposed rafters and is supported on a set of thirteen turned columns. These are paired at each end and backed by an additional six at both ends of the balcony. The columns have pedestals formed as part of the brick parapet, with concave turns upward on either side of each column or pair, creating a scalloped effect. A brass handrail is fitted between the pedestals. The columns are not centrally located above the brick piers below. The roof above is a jerkin-headed design, slightly off centre by an eave projection on the left (northeast) end. At each end, the balcony roof is closed with a weatherboard half-gable. The balcony ceiling is of painted timber boards. Internally the ground floor loggia has overpainted brick walls, and the positioning of now bricked up former doorways and windows is evident. The floor and steps are tiled, and handrails added in the 1990s. There is an alleyway to the west of the building, which provides access to the postal boxes at the rear, inset into a modern extension of red brick with clerestory windows. A bagged brick firewall has been built on the boundary, and the yard is brick paved. The post box 'alley' has a steel framed verandah, and a clear polycarbonate roof. The original kitchen walls are of brick, and there is a bricked up window opening, as well as a new window. Two large, double hung windows illuminate the retail area. Access to the retail area is still from the loggia and by a set of timber doors. An access ramp has been built into the loggia, directly up the stylobate from Wynyard Street. Above the ramp there is a skillion roof, on which the air conditioning plant is located. A concrete access ramp has been added to the side of the building in the alley. It has a pebblecrete surface and steel handrails. The concrete driveway at the other end of the building leads to a large concreted yard at the rear, providing access to the mail delivery room. The original building elevation to the driveway is of unpainted brick. There are three blocked in side doors in this elevation which are rendered and painted, and there are tuck pointed segmented brick arched to the doorways. The rear of the building is dominated by the modern addition, which is constructed of red brick with corbelled details, zincalume corrugated roofing, powder-coated white aluminium framed windows and a steel canopy to protect delivery trucks. Internally, the postal hall been reconfigured to conform to the 1980-1990s Australia Post format, and is screened from the rear offices by a partition. Some original features are still visible, such as the ceiling and tops of windows. The rear offices, mail room and loading area are open plan in form, and the former quarters are now utilised as store rooms, the lunch area, toilets and locker rooms. The cedar staircase is original. There are many original four-panel doors, with ogee inlaid mouldings and architraves. The former porch to the side door has been converted into a postal box filling area. The brick walls have been overpainted, and the raked ceiling is of plasterboard with a scotia cornice. The small sorting room (former kitchen) has plastered walls, with staff moulds on the chimney breast. The upgrade to this space involved the installation a new plasterboard ceiling, scotia cornice and carpet over the timber floor. The large delivery and sorting room replaced the original battery room, and the domestic facilities for the on-site manager and family. The interior finishes are of plasterboard, with a raked ceiling, and clerestory windows. The former external wall has been sheeted over, but the original windows, which formerly opened to the outside are in-situ. There is also a disabled persons' toilet, and a cleaners' room. The former passage from the original rear external door is now used as a parcels store. The back office has original plaster walls, a fire surround, staff moulds, cornice and wall vents. The ceiling may not be the original ceiling and the fireplace has been sealed. The store room has a plasterboard ceiling and modern carpet laid over timber. The original plaster walls and double-hung window are in-situ, the last with its ogee architrave. The Post Master's office is divided from the retail space by a modern plasterboard partition. Original details which have been retained include the double hung window. To the first floor, the original rooms retain plaster walls, skirtings, cornices, fire surrounds, walls vents and window and French doors, albeit with some partitions. The landing and stairwell retain an original double-hung window (without glazing bars) the original skirtings and cornice, and the cedar balustrade to the staircase. The ceiling has been replaced with sheet material. The toilets are modern and have been formed from a former box room and linen press. The locker room (maid's room) retains its original double-hung window with six-pane sashes and ogee architrave. The cornice is square set and the floor is vinyl on timber. = Key areas/elements = * Arcaded verandah, first floor balcony and imposing two-storey presentation to the street * Surviving original fabric and detailing including doors and windows, joinery, skirtings and architraves, staircase = Condition = Generally, the property is in good condition given age and changes in programme. = Original fabric = * Structural frame: concrete footings; brick external walls, brick and timber-framed internal walls, timber framed roof mixed timber and concrete floor structures. * External walls: sandstock face brick with some tuck pointed openings, plaster dressing on arches, window-heads and string courses. * Internal walls: mixture of brick with plaster coating; and timber stud frame with plasterboard cladding. * Floor: mixture of timber and concrete construction; carpeted in the retail and rear office areas, and with vinyl tiles in the lunch room and mail sorting areas.

The post office was substantially altered and extended in 1904, and the shingle roof was replaced with corrugated iron. The first floor balcony was added at this time. An addition to the rear was built in 1995 to a design by Nigel Mereweather. It forms a side alley with access to post boxes and a ramp to the main chamber and comprises a mail sorting room, disabled toilet, cleaners room, and also provides access to fill the postal boxes. The new building replaced some original ancillary rooms, including a battery room, scullery, pantry and bathroom. At the same time, the upstairs toilets were upgraded, the building carpeted, and painted throughout in a grey scheme. Upstairs partitions in one of the former bedrooms may have been built at this time. Similarly, the rear truck canopy is part of the 1995 phase.  Heritage listing  Tumut Post Office, originally built in 1879 to a design of Colonial Architect, James Barnet, is of historical and social significance. The building has been associated with the provision of postal services in the town for over 130 years, and was constructed in a similar period to the nearby court house and police station. In this way it has been part of the consolidation of public buildings in Tumut. Although later modified with a new frontage to Wynyard Street, the historic building remains prominent and recognisably one of the collection of important local public and commercial buildings in the town centre, including those in the Tumut Urban Conservation Area, an attribute which enhances these aspects of significance (criterion a and g). In typological terms, the post office retains an 1879 core as well as the original residential quarters at first floor level. Other original or early internal spaces and planning can also be discerned, albeit with more recent and mostly standard Australia Post fit outs. More generally, the Federation addition of a balcony and an arcaded loggia to Wynyard Street also changed aspects of the original layout. Stylistically and architecturally, Tumut is a fusion of Victorian design from the Barnet period and Federation design from the Vernon-Oakeshott phase of New South Wales Government architecture. While the later works added some character and aesthetic value, the fusion of periods has detracted from a clear emergent style. Nevertheless, the building has a forceful presentation to the street, with significant elements including the imposing two-storey presentation, prominent chimneys, arcaded verandah and scalloped balcony detailing. The internal staircase and fenestration are additionally of a high standard of craftsmanship (criterion d). Aesthetically, Tumut Post Office also contributes to the historic character of the immediate streetscape of this part of the Tumut Urban Conservation Area. This is emphasised by the imposing two-storey presentation, and the handsome and well detailed arcaded verandah and first floor balcony. The building is also an important component of the collection of local historic public and commercial buildings (criterion e). The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Tumut Post Office include the 1879 double-storey main component of the building, and the external envelope of 1904. The modern red brick extension to the rear with awning, and the steel framed verandah with polycarbonate roof and ramp to the post box 'alley' are not significant. Tumut Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Tumut Post Office, originally built in 1879 to a design of Colonial Architect, James Barnet, has been associated with the provision of postal services in the town for over 130 years. The building was also constructed in a similar period to the nearby court house and police station, and in this way has been part of the consolidation of public buildings in Tumut. Although later modified with a new frontage to Wynyard Street, the historic building remains prominent and recognisably one of the important local public buildings, an attribute which enhances this aspect of significance. Criterion D: Characteristic values Tumut Post Office is an example of: 1. Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) 2. Victorian Italianate style with Federation Free style additions 3. Architect: New South Wales Colonial Architect under James Barnet, with alterations by Walter Vernon and George Oakeshott Tumut Post Office, built in 1879 and extended and altered, retains an 1879 core as well as the original residential quarters at first floor level. Other original or early internal spaces and planning can also be discerned, albeit with more recent and mostly standard Australia Post fitouts. The Federation works included addition of a balcony and an arcaded loggia to Wynyard Street, which also changed aspects of the original layout. Stylistically and architecturally, Tumut is a fusion of Victorian design from the Barnet period and Federation design from the Vernon-Oakeshott phase of New South Wales Government architecture.

Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Tumut Post Office, while a fusion of architectural styles from two distinct periods, nevertheless contributes to the historic character of the immediate streetscape of this part of the Tumut Urban Conservation Area, where there are a number of valued buildings from the nineteenth century. The contribution is enhanced by the imposing two-storey presentation, and the handsome and well detailed arcaded verandah and first floor balcony. Criterion G: Social value Tumut Post Office has been the focus of local postal communication services for over 130 years. Its social value is enhanced by its prominent location, and its role in, and contribution to the valued collection of other historic public and commercial buildings in the centre of Tumut, where the Tumut Urban Conservation Area is located.

He is best known for visiting Theresienstadt concentration camp on 23 June 1944; he erroneously reported that Theresienstadt was the final destination for Jewish deportees and that their lives were \\"almost normal\\". His report, which is considered \\"emblematic of the failure of the ICRC\\" during the Holocaust, undermined the credibility of the more accurate Vrba-Wetzler Report and misled the ICRC about the Final Solution. Rossel later visited Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1979, he was interviewed by Claude Lanzmann; based on this footage, the 1997 film A Visitor from the Living (fr) was produced. Early life Information on Rossel's biography is limited. He was born in . He was born in Tramelan, a village in the French speaking part of the Canton of Bern. Until his retirement in the early 1980 decade he was a very appreciated generalist in his home village. His background was typical of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) representatives at the time, as he was a young man, a Swiss Army officer, a doctor, and a Protestant. He later said that his main motivation to join the Red Cross was to avoid a posting to the Swiss border guard. ICRC career Between 12 April 1944 and 1 January 1945, Rossel was based in Berlin, a posting he obtained because of his fluent German. During this period, Rossel participated in seventeen missions, each time visiting several prisoner of war camps. Four of these missions were to camps in the Sudetenland, which, along with his good relationship with Dr. Roland Marti, the head of the Berlin Red Cross delegation, may have influenced his selection for the Theresienstadt visit, despite his inexperience. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, his visits to camps in Upper Silesia put him into contact with prisoners who were aware of the gassing of prisoners at Auschwitz concentration camp, but Rossel later said that he had no knowledge of that. =Theresienstadt visit= Artist's rendition of Theresienstadt living quarters In 1943, the ICRC came under increasing pressure from Jewish organizations and the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to intervene in favor of Jews, in light of accumulating reports of the extermination of Jews by the Nazi regime. In an attempt to preserve its credibility and preeminence as a humanitarian organization, the ICRC requested to visit Theresienstadt concentration camp in November 1943. The visit was also part of a larger program of verification that packages sent by the ICRC to concentration camp prisoners were not being diverted by the German military. It is unclear to what extent the ICRC valued making an accurate report on Theresienstadt, given that it had access to independent information confirming that prisoners were transported to Auschwitz and murdered there. The Danish government also pressured the Nazis to allow a visit, because of the Danish Jews who had been deported there in late 1943. Theresienstadt, a hybrid concentration camp and ghetto, was used as a temporary holding camp for Jews whose final destination was extermination camps, especially Auschwitz. During the camp's existence, 33,000 prisoners died of starvation and illness. The camp had been prepared for the visit by deporting 7,500 of its inhabitants to Auschwitz in order to ease overcrowding. Other prisoners had been forced to work on construction projects to superficially \\"beautify\\" the ghetto, including changing all the street names and building a fake school and other sham institutions that never operated. On the day of the visit, war veterans and other disabled Jews were forbidden from going out onto the streets. On 22 June 1944, Rossel left Berlin with Eigil Juel Hennigsen, head of the Danish Ministry of Health, and Frants Hvass, director general of the Danish Foreign Ministry. The foreigners were chaperoned by several senior Schutzstaffel (SS) officials, most of them dressed in civilian clothes. The next day, they spent eight hours inside Theresienstadt, led on a predetermined path. The visitors were only allowed to speak with Danish Jews and selected representatives, including Paul Eppstein, head of the Council of Elders. Driven in a limousine by an SS officer posing as his driver, Eppstein was forced to describe Theresienstadt as \\"a normal country town\\" of which he was \\"mayor\\", and to give the visitors fabricated statistical data on the camp. Rossel and the other representatives accepted the SS restrictions and made no attempt to investigate further, for example by investigating the stables, basements, and other unsuitable dwellings where most Theresienstadt prisoners were forced to live, or by asking questions of detainees. Signs that Theresienstadt was not what the SS wanted to make it seem included a bruise underneath Eppstein's eye from when he had been beaten by Karl Rahm, the commandant of the camp, a few days earlier. During a brief opportunity to speak with Rossel alone, Eppstein tried to tip him off about the true situation. When asked about the ultimate fate of the prisoners, Eppstein said that there was \\"no way out\\" for them. After the visit, the three foreigners were invited to dine with the Higher SS and Police Leader for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Karl Hermann Frank. =Rossel's report= Photo taken by Rossel at Theresienstadt. Most of the children were murdered at Auschwitz in the fall of 1944. All three visitors wrote reports, although as a condition of the visit, agreed not to distribute them. While the Hennigsen and Hvass reports \\"did not uncover the Nazi lies\\", they expressed sympathy for the Jews. Rossel's report was noted for its uncritical acceptance of Nazi propaganda. He stated that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt; in fact, 68,000 people had already been deported and most murdered. Rossel also said that the camp was a town whose inhabitants had \\"the freedom to organise their administration as they see fit\\". Rossel claimed that the residents were adequately nourished, and even better fed than non-Jews in the Protectorate. He wrote that the inhabitants were fashionably dressed and that their health was \\"carefully looked after\\"; life in the \\"town\\" was \\"almost normal\\". It has been noted that he described the inhabitants of the ghetto as \\"Israelites\\" () instead of \\"Jews\\" (). Echoing Nazi propaganda which depicted a Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy, Rossel described the ghetto as a \\"communist society\\" and Eppstein as a \\"Little Stalin\\". At the end of his report, Rossel casts doubt on the Final Solution: It is unclear what Rossel's true impressions of Theresienstadt were; he said that he was expected to file a factual report, not speculate about what the Nazis might be hiding from him. Some authors have suggested that Rossel knew that the tour of Theresienstadt was a sham, but others disagree. Rossel took 36 photographs during his visit, attaching sixteen to his report. All but one were taken outside, and most portrayed festive scenes staged by the SS, such as the picture of children playing (above). It appears that Rossel was not allowed to photograph hospitals, sanitary installations, or work sites. According to Swiss historians S√©bastien Farr√© and Yan Schubert, the photographs were viewed by the ICRC as neutral statements of fact, even though they were in fact highly staged, not accurately representing the daily life of Theresienstadt prisoners. The ICRC did not release the report from its archives until 1992. =Auschwitz visit= The Auschwitz complex According to Rossel, it was forbidden both by the Nazi regime and the Red Cross to visit Auschwitz. Nevertheless, Rossel became the first Swiss person to visit the camp and spoke to the commandant of Auschwitz I. According to Czech historian Miroslav K√°rn√Ω, the visit was on 29 September 1944, when more than 1,000 Theresienstadt prisoners were gassed and cremated at the nearby Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Rossel said that he did not notice any sign of mass murder. The ICRC states that the visit took place two days earlier, on 27 September. He later said that he did not see much of the camp, but did observe emaciated prisoners (Muselm√§nner) whose appearance greatly shocked him. =Impact and assessment= Rossel's report is considered so important to the study of Theresienstadt and the Holocaust in the Czech lands that the full text was published in the first edition of Terez√≠nsk√© studie a dokumenty, an academic journal sponsored by the Terez√≠n Initiative. According to K√°rn√Ω, Rossel's report, particularly his insistence that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt, had the effect of diminishing the credibility of the Vrba-Wetzler Report. Written by two Auschwitz escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, the latter report accurately described the fate of Jews deported from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz‚Äîmost were murdered. Rossel's statement that Jews were not deported from Theresienstadt caused the ICRC to cancel a planned visit to the Theresienstadt family camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, to which Heinrich Himmler had already given his permission. K√°rn√Ω and Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka draw a direct connection between the report and the liquidation of the family camp in July, in which 6,500 people were murdered. Rossel sent his photographs to , an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a press conference, von Thadden showed copies of the photographs in an attempt to disprove reports on the Holocaust. The Red Cross' response to the Holocaust has been the subject of significant controversy and criticism. The choice of the young and inexperienced Rossel for the Theresienstadt visit has been interpreted as indicative of his organization's indifference to the \\"Jewish problem\\". His report has been described as \\"emblematic of the failure of the ICRC\\" to advocate for Jews during the Holocaust. Survivors accused the Red Cross representatives of seeing only what they wanted to see. One wrote that \\"a serious commission which really wanted to investigate our living conditions.... would have gone independently into the stables and attics\\". However, an April 1945 report on Theresienstadt by a Red Cross delegation led by Otto Lehner was described as \\"even more unconscionable\\". A Visitor from the Living In 1979, Claude Lanzmann interviewed Rossel as part of his Shoah documentary project. Instead of asking Rossel's permission and scheduling an interview, Lanzmann showed up on Rossel's doorstep with a film crew, intending to \\"[tease] out the structure of self-deception that Rossel has constructed in order to be able to live with himself\\". In the interview, Rossel discusses both the Theresienstadt and Auschwitz visits. He blames the inaccuracy of his report on the Jews, who did not attempt to pass notes or covertly advise him that the visit was a sham. Rossel states that he therefore had no choice but to report what the SS allowed him to see. Lanzmann provides facts about the camp and the deceptive tactics used by the Germans, stating that the Jews were unable to tell the truth because they lived in fear of deportation to extermination camps. Despite being informed about the true nature of the camp, Rossel did not express regret or embarrassment over the report. When asked if he stood behind his findings, Rossel answered that he did. Pressed by Lanzmann, Rossel stated that he remembered the color of the Auschwitz commandant's eyes (blue) but nothing about Paul Eppstein. Professor Brad Prager identified a sense of disconnection and othering between Rossel and the Jewish prisoners, which may have led to Rossel's inability to notice nonverbal cues that belied the SS' deception. In 1997, Lanzmann contacted Rossel again for permission to use the interview in a documentary about the Red Cross visit, titled A Visitor from the Living (). Rossel expressed concern that the interview portrayed him in a negative light. Later life After World War II, Rossel left the Red Cross and tried to bury his wartime memories, not even telling his own children what he had seen. Later in his life, he was reported to spend half of each year alone in the mountains. In 1997, he was reported to be in poor health due to palsy.

In the Meiji period, the self- supply of the armed forces with modern weapons was a high concern for the government. The Japanese military leader ≈åmura Masujir≈ç proposed to build a garrison with gun and ammunition production facilities at Osaka Castle. The central location of Osaka favored transport routes over land and water. Although ≈åmura was the victim of an attack in November 1869, his proposal was nevertheless accepted. In February 1870, an office for weapons production ( ÈÄ† ÂÖµ Âè∏ , Z≈çheishi ) was established and in March of the year, the first employees moved into an empty rice warehouse in the northeastern part of the castle Osaka. This was the birth of the Osaka Arsenal. Machines and workers came mainly from the Nagasaki Iron Works. 1871 was renamed the \\"Office for weapons production Osaka\\" ( Â§ßÈò™ ÈÄ† ÂÖµ Âè∏ , ≈åsaka Z≈çheishi ), 1872 in \\"Osaka Factory\\" ( Â§ßÁ†≤ Ë£ΩÈÄ† ÊâÄ , ≈åsaka Seiz≈çsho ), 1875 in \\"Artillery Office of the 2nd Artillery Military District \\" ( Á†≤ÂÖµ Á¨¨‰∫åÊñπÈù¢ ÂÜÖ Á†≤ÂÖµ ÊîØ Âª† , H≈çhei Daini H≈çmennai H≈çhei Shish≈ç ) and finally in 1879 in \\"Artillery Osaka\\" as state production center for guns and grenades, while the Arsenal Tokyo was production center for handguns. During the Satsuma rebellion in 1877, the Arsenal was very active to meet the high demand. Other wars such as the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905) allowed the arsenal to increase, so that it captured the entire eastern side of the castle grounds. The staff strength fluctuated strongly; During times of crisis many workers were hired, and then released. This led to tensions with the workforce, especially in December 1906 after the Russo-Japanese War and in October 1919 after the First World War . During the Pacific War , the workforce of the Arsenal grew steadily, reached over 60,000 employees and developed into one of the largest military factories in the Empire. Towards the end of the war, however, the production yield sank due to material and labor shortages. Osaka became the target of American air strikes from 1945 ; the arsenal was initially only slightly damaged. On August 14, 1945, a day before the capitulation of Japan. However, there was a devastating air raid that destroyed 90% of the arsenal. The death toll on the arsenal site is relatively low at 382 dead, as most of the workers, with the exception of air defense, left the area after the air alarm. The death toll outside the arsenal site is unknown. With the end of the Pacific War, the 75-year history of the Arsenal came to an end. After the war, the extensive grounds were partially overbuilt by commercial high-rise buildings, and partly used as a park ( Osaka Castle Park).National Diet Library : Osaka Army Arsenal ( Memento of the original of 9 February 2013 in the Internet Archive ) References Osaka Imperial Japanese Army Meiji period ","title":"Osaka Arsenal"},{"id":"58489541","text":"Martin Maxwell Fleming Luckie (30 January 1868 ‚Äì 3 July 1951) was a New Zealand cricketer who played two matches of first-class cricket 29 years apart ‚Äì one in 1891 and the other in 1920.

The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= pre-1780s - local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. 1789 - Governor Philip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Cliffbrook= The existing property Cliffbrook presently stands on part of an original estate named \\"Cliff-Brook\\" which comprised three parcels of crown land granted between 1845 - 1846 to Lewis Gordon, a State Government Surveyor. The original land grant was for four acres 1 rood and was followed a year later by two further parcels, one 1 acre 3 roods 30 perches. The Cliffbrook estate today stands on part of the latter parcel. Extensive changes to the boundaries' of the estate have occurred through time. Lewis Gordon apparently erected a house on the estate, however, no record of it can be found today. Between 1846 and 1856 the estate was sold in full to M. H. Lewis and subsequently to O. M. Lewis. It was sold again in 1859 to Australian footballer, John Thompson. By this time, the \\"Cliff-Brook\\" estate included a further parcel of land. The grounds were \\"over then, and included the sheltered bay\\" - Gordon's Bay. John Thompson was a local businessman who became Mayor of Randwick in 1873. Thompson is believed to have built the original Cliff-Brook mansion in the 1860s. Designed in the Victorian Italianate style: \\"the main walls of the house were solid stone quarried from the site. the balustrades to the verandahs and parapet walls were brickwork rendered in cement. The whole of the external walls and cement mouldings were given a lime and cement wash to give the building a uniform colour. The large verandah on the upper floor was laid in Italian mosaic imported from Rome, the main entrance hall floor was tiled. There was a stone lodge at the main entrance gates. large stone stables with four horse stalls. coach house, harness room and man's quarters.\\" The stone buildings were located on the northern end of the estate where the current mansion stands. The property was again sold in 1889 to George Hill. The later additions to the mansion, including the towers are believed to have been carried out by George Hill. Hill was \\"a squatter and a horse-player and we may never know which sent him broke\\" but in 1899 he was declared bankrupt and the property was repossessed by the Bank of New South Wales in payment of debts owing to the Bank. The Bank employed a caretaker to look after the house and grounds which were apparently used as a poultry farm. After spending \\"some (Pounds)600 clearing up the house and garden, the caretaker was finally dismissed. In 1905 Sir Denison Miller, then assistant to the general Manager of the Bank of New South Wales, was asked to occupy the mansion, rent free. Six years later, Miller now first Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, purchased the estate. \\"He paid A‚Ç§8,000 for the land and house and later sold the foreshores of Thompson's Bay\\" to Randwick Municipal Council for A‚Ç§3,000. The present Cliffbrook mansion was built in 1921, according to the Randwick Historical Society's documentation, designed by architect John Kirkpatrick in the Federation Free Classical style. The original stone buildings were demolished to accommodate the residence. Kirkpatrick had established himself as a prominent architect in Sydney by the late 1880s. He was the architect for several important surviving buildings in the City including the Colonial Mutual Life Building, Martin Place (1894) the Commonwealth Bank, Pitt Street (1914). Although Thomas Rowe won the competition for the Sydney Hospital Buildings on Macquarie Street, Kirkpatrick was commissioned by the government to finish the project. The design of the operating Theatre and Chapel at the rear is attributed to Kirkpatrick. He was also architect for grandstands at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The authorship of the design remains unresolved. The lack of primary source references in secondary sources consulted suggests that a resolution of this question will require much more research. Uncorroborated oral evidence provided in an inquiry to the Australian Heritage Commission suggested a strong friendship between Sir Denison Miller and Kirkpatrick, perhaps connected with Mlller's Governorship of the Commonwealth Bank from 1911 and Kirkpatrick's commission for the Pitt Street Bank Building completed in 1914. Peter McCallum, who is currently a Principal of E. A. and T. M. Scott, has advised that he recalls the firm's archives were destroyed in 1958. E. A. Scott established his practice in 1888: after World War I the firm was E. A. Scott, Green and Scott: and after 1949 the name E. A. and T. M. Scott was adopted. McCallum is not able to connect Cliffbrook with the firm but did note that E. A. Scott designed many houses in Lang Road, Centennial Park, often recognised because of his use of \\"plum-coloured\\" bricks. The present evidence is circumstantial. Cliffbrook may have been designed by Kirkpatrick, or E. A. Scott, or (a third possibility) by Kirkpatrick in association with E. A. Scott. This theory is based on the presumption that Kirkpatrick, late in his career, may have undertaken part of the commission and sought assistance from a younger architect - or may have, for reasons as yet unknown, been unable to complete the commission which was then taken over by E. A. Scott The new house took on the name Cliffbrook and the earlier residence was subsequently known as \\"Gordon Court\\". Miller died in 1923 and the property was sold to Welki King before finally being sold to the Australian Government. During the Second World War the estate was occupied by the army to serve as a school of tropical medicine. After 1945, \\"Gordon Court\\" and part of the estate was auctioned and sold to Friedrich Schiller, a Hungarian, electrician who lived in, the mansion with his sister. \\"Gordon Court\\" was eventually sold in 1977 and promptly demolished to make way for housing development. The site as it stands today was purchased by the Commonwealth and housed the headquarters of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) from 1953 to 1981 (later renamed the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) (ANSTO). The property purchase by the AAEC was not finalised until 1959, for the sum of $13,518.42. The period between 1953 and 1981 saw the most far reaching changes to the site. Three substantial buildings were added to the site. A single storey brick residence. a single-storey brick office building. and a 2-3 storey brick office building. Along with these were lesser buildings including two fibro buildings (which may date from the army's occupancy) and a small greenhouse. The exact dates of construction of three brick buildings are not known. Max Dupain's photographs of the site dated 1965 show that both the L-shaped brick office building and the single storey brick office building existed at this time and presumably too the residence. The photographs also show that in 1965 the present 2-3 storey L-shaped building comprised a single storey on its northern wing and 3 storeys on the eastern wing. This photograph also shows a mature Norfolk Island Pine in the space between Cliffbrook and the three storey wing. It appears from ANSTO records that the single storey northern wing of the L shaped building existed prior to 1958 when architects Budden Nangle and Michael designed the three storey eastern wing. The caretakers cottage was also designed in 1958. The Green house was erected in March 1959. The eastern wing although containing the equivalent number of storeys as today has been altered on its western and southern faces. The northern wing has had a further level added to it and has also had its facade significantly altered since 1965. The alterations to the L-shaped building were carried out after 1969. The architects Edwards. Madigan. Torzillo and Partners. were employed to design and document the alterations and additions to this building. The contract documents prepared for this work are dated July 1969 and from this we can assume that the additions were carried out soon after 1969. The most substantial alterations to Cliffbrook were in 1963 - 64. Plans by Budden Nangle and Michael dated 19 September 1963 show how the original kitchen G 12/G 13 was opened up by removal of the south wall, installation of a new lower ceiling and construction of the existing inquiry counter where a former hall closet existed. The kitchen stove recess had new shelves and doors fitted and the south door and partition wall in G 13 was constructed at this time. A drawing dated 15 May 1964 shows removal of the north wall of the main upstairs bathroom and construction of a new W.C. compartment, new dog-leg stud partition wall (between U7 and U8) and a built in wardrobe. The alterations to the en-suite bathroom and re-opening of the door between U2 and U3 are also shown in the drawing. In 1981 the Australian Atomic Energy Commission now known as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) moved their headquarters to Lucas Heights in 1981.McDonald McPhee, 1993. During 1988 the Commonwealth Government sought to dispose of the property. As an item of State significance a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 28 October 1988 to ensure the future conservation and management of the property. In 1993 ownership of the property was transferred to the University of New South Wales for research and administrative purposes. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  =Site and garden= Cliffbrook stands in a large suburban lot, with an established garden. Lawns abut the main house, with sealed drive sweeping up to its portico / porte cochere. Three Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) mark the front yard and view in from Beach Street. A number of palm species are also in the garden. A large Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) is towards the rear on the southern side boundary.Stuart Read, pers.comm. from photographs, 31/10/2014 =Stone boundary walls= The boundary wall was built in two stages. The western boundary wall is constructed in roughly squared and coursed sandstone with a soft lime mortar containing uncalcified lenses of lime. Successive attempts to repoint eroding mortar in a hard cement rich mix have detracted from its appearance and contributed little to its structural condition. The main entry gates in the western boundary wall are of no significance, however the gate opening is in the same location as the original main gates shown in the 1893 survey. The northern boundary wall's stonework is also irregularly coursed but individual stones are more precisely squared and generally larger in size. A wall is shown in this location in a detail survey by T. B. U. Sloman. 25 September 1893 and encloses the stable yard. A photograph in 1883 shows Cliffbrook and the west boundary wall and a large gap extending east from the north east corner to a paling fence. The mortar is a very hard white cement rich mix - harder than the stone itself. Attempts to patch erosion in darker grey hard cement mortar appear to address the erosion of stone around the cement mortar joints not deterioration of the mortar itself. The mortar patching which is excessive and unsightly has done little to improve the condition of the wall. There are stone buttresses to both walls. Most of the buttresses to the northern wall are bonded in and are of the same period of construction. The buttresses to the west wall appear to be of two periods of construction: neither type is bonded into the older wall: both are laid in hard cement mortar: the northernmost rectangular form buttress appears to be of the same construction as the buttresses in the north wall. All but the northernmost buttress in the western boundary wall are shown in the 1893 Survey plan. No buttresses are shown at the north walls at this time. The date of the western boundary wall is not indicated clearly by documentary evidence available at present, although its construction, and particularly the mortar type is consistent with the technology of the original Cliffbrook mansion built in the 1860s. It is unlikely to be later than 1870s when cement was more readily available for mortar mixes and concrete. It is seen in an 1883 photograph. However documentary evidence of Sloman's Survey Plan of 1893 and the 1883 photograph show that the north wall and buttresses to the west wall certainly precede the construction of the 1920s Cliffbrook. =The garage= The garage is an unimposing structure constructed from recycled sandstone in a hard cement mortar. Its walls are not bonded into the older west wall. Again, documentary evidence has not revealed the precise time of construction. It might be expected that, if it was constructed at the same time as Cliffbrook, it would show some similarity in style and materials. It does not. In the 1920s garages were still a relatively new and uncommon building type owing more to the tradition of stables. Following this tradition garages of this period were usually designed as secondary utilitarian structures which did not attempt to compete with the architecture of the primary residential building on the site. This garage conforms to the usual pattern, although there is no evidence to prove exactly when it was built. It can be confidently concluded that the garage structure dates from some time in the 1920s or early 1930s. The clues to this \\"time band\\" for its construction can be seen in the detailing of the northern windows and architraves and the underlying layer of kalsomine paint on the internal faces of the sandstone walls. Otherwise the building has no features of architectural, aesthetic or technical distinction. It has been modified many times in an ad hoc manner: * the skillion roof construction is of no particular technical interest and * the asbestos cement and caneite ceiling panels are in poor condition * the southern louvre window is a later replacement of an earlier window leaving the original architraves. * the internal single skin brick walls detract from the spatial quality and appearance of the interior. * the roller shutter door is a recently added standard item. * the former southern garage door has been infilled by a timber vertical board wall and door, now in very poor condition. The petrol pump standing by the south east corner is of early vintage but apparently is now non-functional. =House= Cliffbrook is a two-storey liver brick building with sandstone detailing. It is designed in the Inter Wars Free Classical style. Its overall form and stylistic elements employed in the external design have antecedents in the Victorian Italianate style, although the liver brick work, the simple stone detailing, the terrazo floors and interior joinery are distinctly of the 1920s. The construction of the house consists of a slate roof, copper gutters and downpipes, bracketed eaves, liver brick walls with sandstone quoins, sandstone window and door heads and sandstone sills, sandstone porticos and terraces in the north, east and west elevations and white painted timber double hung windows, front doors and French doors to the upper level terraces. The interiors are relatively plain, having moulded plaster ceilings of Regency style with deep coved cornices only to the main living and reception rooms. The original door and window joinery is largely intact - these elements, like the deep timber skirting which survives in most rooms were dark stained maple. In some rooms original timber finishes have been covered by white paint.  Heritage listing  As at 9 September 2011, Cliffbrook is of State heritage significance for its association with the larger original Estate \\"Cliff-brook\\" of John Thompson, Mayor of Randwick in 1873, being the largest surviving area of land of that estate, following successive subdivisions and sales. It is significant through its association with the first owner Sir Denison Miller who was the first Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The house may be found to be a late work of John Kirkpatrick a prominent architect in Sydney from the 1880s responsible for major commissions such as the Colonial Mutual Life Building, Grandstands at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Commonwealth Bank Pitt Street Sydney. It may also be established that E. A. Scott was involved in the building's creation. The firm established by E. A. Scott in 1888 still practices today in the name of E. A. and T. M. Scott. The house of a high standard of architectural design. It is well proportioned, has an impressive scale and appearance befitting Sir Denison Miller's prestige and position in public life. The design in the Inter Wars Free Classical style contains anomalous applications of the Italianate style rare in the 1920s. It is the more significant for its rarity being such a late example containing elements of the Italianate style. The building displays high standards of craftsmanship in the brickwork and joinery particularly, as excellent examples of the techniques employed and use of the materials in the 1920s. Cliffbrook was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cliffbrook has associations with significant historical figures. The first owner was Sir Denison Miller, the first governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Cliffbrook may also be found to be the work of John Kirkpatrick, a prominent 1880s Sydney architect responsible for major commissions such as the Colonial Mutual Life Building, grandstands at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Commonwealth bank, Pitt Street. E.A.Scott may also have been involved in the building's creation. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house of a high standard of architectural design. It is well proportioned, has an impressive scale and appearance befitting Sir Denison Miller's prestige and position in public life. The design in the Inter Wars Free Classical style contains anomalous applications of the Italianate style rare in the 1920s. It is the more significant for its rarity being such a late example containing elements of the Italianate style. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building displays high standards of craftsmanship in the brickwork and joinery particularly, as excellent examples of the techniques employed and use of the materials in the 1920s. Despite its conservative architectural style, the building contains examples of contemporary construction techniques and use of materials in the use of reinforced concrete structures, the use of terrazzo floor finishes and the use of dark \\"liver\\" bricks.

On July 1, 2014, they merged into the Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows Community School District. The Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield and Dows school districts began a whole grade sharing agreement in 2005. Under the agreement Dows maintained their own elementary school and sent students in grades 6-12 to Clarion. The districts shared administration and several staff members. In 2014, the districts consolidated into one district and the Dows Elementary School was closed. The Dows School building was sold to be used to warehouse Pioneer Seed. The playground and athletic complex were gifted to the City of Dows. In 1981, Clarion and Goldfield began a whole grade sharing agreement that included sharing the high school, this was expanded to include the middle school in 1986. The two districts passed a consolidation (99% and 89% approval) to merge the two districts into the Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield Community School District. The Goldfield building continued to house elementary classes until closing in 2008. The Goldfield building continues to be used for athletic events and practices and is available to rent for events. The district territory also saw expansion in when Clarion and Galt consolidated in the 1960s. In 1987, the Boone Valley School District of Renwick dissolved, with the former district being divided between Humboldt and Clarion/Goldfield. In 2015, Corwith‚ÄìWesley dissolved with portions of the district being split between Algona/LuVerne, West Hancock, and Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows. Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows High School was built in 1969. A weight room was built in 2003 by the Sports Boosters. In 2004 an addition and renovation project was completed building an addition to the north and a new art room, pottery room, business room, 2 computer labs, wrestling room, 4 locker rooms, and geothermal heating and cooling to the north northwest half of the facility. In 2007 another project was completed that included a south addition and extensive renovations to create new and renovated facilities for a library media center, ICN room, computer lab, chemistry/physics lab, renovated biology lab, 7 new classrooms, expanded and renovated offices, new main entrance, and a hallway/entrance to the east. The project included extensive renovations and new geothermal heating and cooling to the southeastern portion of the building. Plans for the future include a 650-seat auditorium addition or a possible auxiliary gym. In 2014 the parking lot was redone as well. The Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows Elementary and Middle School complex began with a 3-story high school building built in 1913, located on what is now the circle drive. In 1936, the 2-story elementary school was built as it stands today. In the late 1950s a building project was completed that included a northwest addition to the elementary school, an east addition to the elementary school, and what is now the middle school was built as a north addition to the high school that also connected the two buildings into one facility. The high school was moved to the new building in Northeast Clarion in 1971. The facility then became a P/K‚Äì8 facility. In 1993, the 1913 portion of the building was demolished, the middle school was capped and a new front entrance and circle drive were built. An addition was built to the north of the elementary school including a multipurpose room (gymnasium/cafeteria), library media center, ICN room, 2 computer labs, and additional classrooms. The 1936 elementary building and east addition was extensively renovated at this time. In 2002 a north addition was built to the middle school, adding 4 additional classrooms. In 2007, an extensive renovation project was completed to the middle school and northwest elementary addition that also included a small addition to the southwest, near the front entrance. In 2003, a new playground was completed. Plans are underway for a potential addition to the north side of the multipurpose room that will include additional locker rooms and a baseball/softball hitting facility, which will also serve as a tornado and emergency shelter for the school and community. The football field and track facilities are located east of the elementary/middle school, which were built in 1938. The football stadium is one of the only ones in Iowa with a covered stadium. The Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows continues to partner with area school districts to provide additional opportunities to students. Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows and CAL (Latimer) are sharing high school football and cross country in 2015. Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows and Eagle Grove share a transportation director, vocational agriculture instructor, and juvenile court liaison. Additionally, Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows partners with Iowa Central Community College to offer a wide range of dual credit college courses, many of which are offered to students at no cost and are taught by high school faculty.

In 1914 a brick school building was built in the northwest side of town, where it stands today. In 1935, a two-story addition was built to the west that includes the gymnasium, office space, home economics room, and the upper level includes the library media center with two computer labs. In 1954 a one-story addition was built to the west that includes six elementary classrooms, band room, art room, ICN room, and Ag/Shop area. In 1961 an addition was built to the west of the elementary wing and includes four additional elementary classrooms. It was in the 1950s and 1960s that enrollment reached record levels of 532 students. In 1980 a multipurpose room was built to the north of the gym. In the 1980s and 1990s a bond issue was passed an extensive renovations were completed to all parts of the building. Dows had many successes in sports over the years. The Dows Tigers won the state baseball championship in 1928. They also qualified for state in 1937. Dows had 2 individual girls state track championships. Dows/CAL qualified for the Class 1A State Football Playoffs in 1993. Dows had basketball players receive all-state basketball recognition in 1991, 1992, 1995, and 1996. Dows and CAL shared football, track, baseball, and softball in the last few years of the Dows High School. Dows and Northeast Hamilton also shared a girls basketball team for the 1997‚Äì98 season, which finished with a record of 19‚Äì4. The CAL/Dows High School began a wrestling program in 2002, with meets and practices being held at Dows. This lasted until the CAL/Dows partnership ended and included one year of a shared CAL/Dows/Northeast Hamilton wrestling program being held at Dows. Dows was a founding member of the North Star Conference and continued membership into the 1950s and early 1960s. Teams in the early years of the North Star Conference included Boone Valley (Renwick), Corwith-Wesley, Dows, Fertile, Franklin Consolidated (now CAL of Latimer), Goldfield, Kanawha, Klemme, LuVerne, Rockwell, Sheffield, and Ventura. Dows was a member of the Iowa River Valley Conference in the 1960s and 1970s, which included Alden, Dows, Gilbert, Hubbard, NESCO, Northeast Hamilton, Radcliffe, and Union-Whitten. In the late 1970s, Dows rejoined the North Star Conference, which over the years included Alden, CAL of Latimer (later CAL/Dows), Corwith- Wesley/LuVerne, Dows, Meservey-Thornton, Northeast Hamilton of Blairsburg, Sheffield-Chapin (later SCMT, now West Fork), Southeast Webster-Grand, Twin River Valley of Bode, Ventura, and Woden-Crystal Lake/Titonka. CAL/Dows High School continued to be a member of the North Star Conference until it dissolved in 2004. At that time CAL/Dows joined the Iowa Star Conference. Dows began whole grade sharing with Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield in 2005 and consolidated to become Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows in 2014. Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows is a member of the North Central Conference, which currently includes Algona, Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield-Dows, Clear Lake, Hampton-Dumont, Humboldt, Iowa Falls- Alden, St. Edmond Catholic (Fort Dodge), and Webster City. Dows maintained a K-12 elementary program, with a community funded preschool program, until 1998. The last class to graduate from Dows High School was in 1998. In the fall of that same year, the district began a whole grade sharing agreement with CAL Community School of Latimer, IA that would last for the next seven years. Under the agreement, both Dows and CAL maintained separate elementary schools (K-5), the shared Dows/CAL Middle School (6-8) was housed at Dows, and the shared CAL/Dows High School was at Latimer. The districts shared a superintendent and several staff members. In 2003 and 2004, much discussion was held about the future of the districts. Possibilities were discussed including a 3-way whole grade sharing agreement between Hampton-Dumont, CAL, and Dows; continuing or expanding 2-way sharing between CAL and Dows; and Dows beginning a 1-way whole grade sharing agreement with either Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield, Belmond-Klemme, or CAL. After much discussion it was ultimately it was decided that Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield would provide the best educational opportunities and stability for the long-term future of Dows area students. When the partnership with CAL Community School ended, CAL re-established itself as an independent P/K-12 school district. Initially, quite a few of the high school students that were already attending CAL open enrolled to finish attending school at CAL. Over time, as those classes graduated a vast majority of the Dows students were attending school in Clarion. In 2005 the district began a ten- year whole grade sharing agreement with Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield School District. Dows maintains its own separate P/K-5 elementary school and students in grades 6‚Äì12 attended school in Clarion. The districts also shared a superintendent, principal, and several other staff members. In 2006, the district began the Tiger Learning Center (TLC), an after school program. In 2008, Dows Elementary School became a multi-age school that combines classrooms kindergarten and first grade, second and third grades, and fourth and fifth grades. Dows Elementary offered small class sizes that provide individualized attention and an academic program that can compete with any in the state. In 2008‚Äì09, the Dows Elementary School reported some of the highest Iowa Tests of Basic Skills results of any school in the state. The Dows district received a grant for the preschool program to be funded by the state in 2009‚Äì10. In 2013‚Äì14, the sharing agreement was expanded to include grades 4‚Äì12. The Dows Elementary School educated students in Dows for preschool through third grade for that year. On September 10, 2013, voters in both districts approved consolidation into one district. Beginning with the 2014‚Äì15 school year, the Dows and Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield districts became the Clarion‚ÄìGoldfield‚ÄìDows Community School District. The new district covers 363 square miles in include portions of Wright, Franklin, Hancock, and Humboldt Counties, and stretches approximately 50 miles from the northwest corner near Renwick to the southeast corner near Dows. During the final year as an independent school district, the certified enrollment at Dows increased from 124 to 139. With the consolidation, the Dows building was closed in its centennial year of operation. All students will be bussed to Clarion for all classes and activities. The district sold the school building and bus barn to a company wanting to use it to warehouse pioneer seed. Some people in the community were unhappy, stating that they feel that there was no public involvement or communication in that decision.

The operation was a success for the Red Army, as Odessa was taken on February 8 and, despite the organisation of an evacuation over the Black Sea supported by the British Navy, many White soldiers and material were captured.  Capture of Odessa  After the failed White Advance on Moscow in Summer 1919, the Red Army had started a counteroffensive in Autumn 1919, which after several hard-fought battles, had by Winter 1919-1920 turned into a rout of the White forces. On January 17, 1920 the troops of the Red Army seized Krivoi Rog (now Kryvyi Rih) and Apostolove. On January 24, they captured Yelisavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi) and on January 25, Uman. By the end of January, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Voznesensk were captured. On February 3, Olviopol (now Pervomaisk) and Ochakov (now Ochakiv) were captured. On February 6, the Red Army approached Odessa. Early in the morning of February 7, they broke into the city, and on February 8, Odessa was completely captured by the Red Army. Great help to the Red Army in taking the city was provided by the Odessa workers, who, on the orders of the Revolutionary Committee, had taken up arms and seized critical points in Odessa just before the approach of the regular units.  Evacuation by the sea  British troops in Odessa port, February 1920 Russian refugees waiting to come on board the Rio Negro Russian refugees coming on board the Rio Negro Aware of the desperate situation, the command of the AFSR in Odessa had started an evacuation over the Black Sea on February 3. Contemporaries of events and historians called the Odessa evacuation of 1920, ill prepared and \\"mediocre\\". Only 1 in 3 could be evacuated. In the city of Odessa, 3 AFSR generals, about 200 officers and 3,000 soldiers (including 1,500 sick and wounded in hospitals) were taken prisoner. According to reports of the Odessa Soviet newspapers of those days, 300,000 pounds of grain also remained in the port of Odessa, 50,000 pounds were found on barges moored in the quarantine harbor. On the ship \\"Alexandria\\" a load of brand new British motorcycles of the brand \\"Triumph\\" was found, sent by England to the AFSR and 3,000 pounds of coal. The Railroad tracks were clogged with abandoned wagons with a variety of goods evacuated from Kiev and current Southern Ukraine, including 130,000 pounds of firewood. The total number of evacuees is difficult to calculate, as transport ships with evacuees dispersed to different ports and many refugees were evacuated privately. Soviet sources reported 3,000 evacuees, which did not correspond to reality. White Guard sources reported 16,000 as a reasonable minimum number of evacuees, with about 40,000 people willing to be evacuated. From the military equipment and supplies, it was possible to evacuate all the tanks that had arrived in Odessa from Nikolaev (now Mykolaiv), almost all serviceable armored vehicles and parts of the equipment of the technical troops, cars and aviation assets. The British ships involved in the evacuation were : * HMT Rio Negro, received about 1,400 refugees, wounded officers and cadets. Went to the port of Thessaloniki (Greece) * HMT Rio Pardo, transported refugees to Greece  * several destroyers * Coalship Votan The French sent And the US sent the destroyer with Hugo W. Koehler on board.  Ovidiopol detachment  The garrison of Odessa and other parts of the AFSR, which had previously retreated to the city, as well as various detachments of \\"militiamen\\" could not be evacuated by sea. They united in the \\"Ovidiopol detachment\\" and were ordered to march to the border with Romania. They were accompanied by a large number of civilians, families of officers of the Volunteer Army, foreigners, wounded and about 600 cadets of the Odessa Cadet Corps (most of which were junior grades - 10-12 years). About 16,000 people, of which no more than 3,000 were able to carry weapons, departed in mid-winter from Odessa on February 7 and moved to the Gross-Liebental - Ovidiopol area, from where they intended to go to Romania. But they were not admitted into Romania by the Romanian authorities and found themselves trapped as the Red units took Maiac and Tiraspol, thus depriving the \\"Ovidiopol detachment\\" of the possibility of uniting with the \\"Bredov detachment\\", and marching towards Poland. The Ovidiopol detachment was not allowed by the Romanians into their territory. The Romanians did not even let the Cadet children enter, but fired their artillery when a Cadet column headed towards them over the ice across the Dniester. The trapped Ovidiopol detachment lost hundreds of people from attacks by the Red cavalry, shelling by Romanian troops and local marauders. After 5-7 days, the remaining 12,000 people capitulated. At that time, many officers (including General Vasiliev and Baron Maidel) committed suicide, preferring death to Bolshevik captivity.  The Bredov detachment  The units of the AFSR under command of Lieutenant-General Nikolai Bredov and all troops in right-bank Ukraine, were ordered by Lieutenant-General Schilling to march towards Poland. Accompanied by numerous refugees and civilians, they carried out an unprecedented winter march, under constant pressure of superior Red forces, and reached Poland. This march became known as the Bredov Campaign.  Results  By the end of February 1920, all White forces had been chased from Western-Ukraine. The AFSR now only held the Northern Caucasus and Crimea. In total, about 1,200 officers were captured by the Reds. All of them were placed in concentration camps, where they were gradually shot. A mass shooting was held on May 5, 1920. In Odessa, 100 guns of different calibers, four armored vehicles, four armored trains, several hundred thousand shells and cartridges, some engineering, automobile, aviation and other property, and tons of food were captured by the Red Army.

It was built from 1876 to 1886. It is also known as Coogee Women's Pool and Ladies Baths. The property is owned by Randwick City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011.  History  =Indigenous history= When Captain James Cook, and later the First Fleet, landed on Botany Bay, they encountered the Eora people, a vast and complex Aboriginal group of family and kin relations. \\"Their territory spread from the Georges River and Botany Bay in the south to Port Jackson, north to Pittwater at the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and west along the river to Parramatta\\".State Library of NSW, \\"Eora: Mapping Aboriginal Sydney 1770-1850\\", p.1. The coast and harbour were particularly important environments for the Aboriginal people of the Eora group, being an abundant source for fishing, food gathering and recreation. It has been reported that the site now occupied by the McIver Women's Baths, had long been used by the local Aboriginal women for bathing (the men frequenting the northern side of Coogee Beach). Whether or not these statements hold some truths, it is widely understood that the coastal environment was of great importance to the lifestyle of the Eora people. =Colonial history= There is considerable evidence to suggest that the early colonists regularly used the harbour for bathing. The hot climate and ready accessibility to the water made recreational bathing increasingly attractive and the activity was further encouraged by the British medical profession of the day proclaiming the therapeutic benefits of bathing in salt water and in the open air. Although a socially accepted pastime, bathing (particularly by men) was often conducted in the nude which resulted in moral concerns as early as 1810. In an effort to discourage naked bathing in open places where respectable people (primarily women and children) could take offence, Governor Macquarie released an edict declaring that \\"a very indecent and improper custom having lately prevailed of soldiers, sailors and inhabitants of the town bathing themselves at all hours of the day at the Government Wharf and also in the dock-yard, His Excellency, the NSW Governor, directs and commands that no person shall bathe at either of these places in the future, at any hours of the day\\".Clarkson, \\"Lanes of Gold\\", p.9 Despite these early restrictions, the activity remained a popular and fashionable pastime in the colony. Public bathing in Sydney Further efforts to regulate the practice came with the construction of the first public bathing house in the Domain in 1826. Open only to men, the establishment of a women's bathing house soon followed in the 1830s. Despite officially establishing enclosed venues where people could undress and bathe in a private and concealed space, the \\"menace\\" of open bathers continued, finally resulting in laws being made in 1833 prohibiting bathing \\"near to or within view of any public wharf, quay or bridge, street, road or other public resort within the limits of the towns between the hours of six in the morning and eight o'clock in the evening\\".Raszeja, \\"A Decent and Proper Exertion\\", pp.31-32 Unlike Governor Macquarie's previous edict, any transgressions of this Act carried a fine of one pound - a sizeable amount to the working man of the day. As well as enforcing the notion of public decency and modesty, restricting swimming also served to protect open water bathers from the threat of sharks in the harbour. With the colony developing in (what is now) the centre of Sydney, the early industries were actively discharging waste and pollution directly into the harbour thus attracting a greater number of sharks. Ultimately, \\"with the threat of \\"finny fiends\\", a hot climate, the growing influence of the \\"respectable\\" middle classes, a wider enjoyment of spare money and leisure time, plus a widespread belief in the efficacy of salt-water bathing and the virtues of exercise, the construction of swimming pools increased apace\\".Raszeja, \\"A Decent and Proper Exertion\\", p.33 Coogee, having quickly become known for its beach environment, was soon attracting visitors and permanent residents prior to its gazettal as a village in 1838. With its growing population, there were reports that the baths were already in use as early as the 1830s. Up until this point, the women in the colony had been restricted in their usage of the various men's pools around Sydney (often limited to certain days of the week and even certain hours of the day), but the popularity of this naturally occurring and sheltered rock pool led to it being developed by Randwick Council and officially opened as 'women's-only' baths in 1876. Having been excavated to an appropriate depth and enclosed with concrete walls, the baths were now a designated area where women could bathe in a private place. As well as being the only legal form in which people could swim during daylight hours, ocean and harbour baths were also valued by the community as a smooth and calm swimming environment that provided security against drowning. At the time, despite great popularity as a form of physical recreation and exercise, few colonists had any regard for water safety or could even swim. In the early 19th century, drowning was a \\"major concern in a colony that relied heavily on water transport and where men, women and children with few swimming skills habitually wore heavy clothing that increased their risk of drowning\\".https://www.nswoceanbaths.info/topics/t037.htm As the notion of bathing evolved into the activity of swimming, lifesaving skills became regarded as a community, as well as personal, improvement. The early Australian beach culture had begun. The evolution of swimming coincided with the widespread inclusion of swimming lessons in the school curriculum for girls in NSW. Sport was promoted as a physical balance to the mental activities of the school day but swimming, in particular, was encouraged as a graceful and respectful exercise for women to pursue. The sport was one that posed little to no threat to the established social expectations required of women in the late 19th century. Swimming was seen to have the virtue of disguising the body under water while hiding any outward appearances of power, endurance or physical exertion. With the usual undesirable effects of exercise effectively hidden from public view, the pure Victorian image of womanhood was maintained. At the turn of the century, although swimming was growing in popularity, the activity was still restricted by the day-light hours ban that had been in place since 1833. The successful stand against these regulations came in September 1902 when William Gocher (editor of the Manly and North Sydney News) made it his personal crusade to publicly disobey the ban. At noon on three successive Sundays, Gocher entered the ocean at Manly Beach and on the third occasion was arrested in front of some 1000 spectators. This action led to a liberalisation of the law in 1903, with the condition that all swimmers over eight years old wore neck-to-knee bathing costumes. Other conditions of the rescinded ban were that bathers had to leave the beach immediately after swimming and that there was to be no gender mixing or socialisation with members of the \\"dressed\\" public. =Competitive swimming as a sport= Around this same period, the McIver Women's Baths underwent a change in its management. Previously, the responsibility of developing and maintaining the baths had been extended by the State Government to Randwick Council under the Municipal Baths Act 1896. However, from 1918, management of the site went into the hands of private operators, Robert and Rose McIver, who developed the baths into the form maintained today. Rose McIver (alongside Mina Wylie, Bella O'Keefe and members of the Mealing and Wickham families) also had a significant role in the establishment of the Randwick and Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club. When established in 1923, the club took over the McIver's lease of the site and has managed the baths ever since. During this period, swimming as a competitive sport was growing in popularity. For both participants and spectators, swimming was an uncomplicated, low cost event with high entertainment value. Although swimming competitions were not held at the McIver Women's Baths (due, in part, to its short and irregular shape), it was the venue where a number of significant female swimmers first learnt their craft. As young girls, Sarah \\"Fanny\\" Durack and Wilhelmina \\"Mina\\" Wylie frequented the baths and both went on to become the first women to win gold and silver medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games (the first games that allowed women to participate in swimming competition - the 100m freestyle). In the lead up to the Olympics, Durack and Wylie's bid to participate was severely threatened by the gender segregation that remained prevalent at swimming venues across NSW. In the early 20th century, the New South Wales Amateur Swimming Association (NSWASA) was the central controlling body for competitive swimming but, needing increasing attention, women's sport was soon administered by the newly-created New South Wales Ladies Amateur Swimming Association (NSWLASA) in 1906. Under the conservative feminist leadership of Rose Scott, the NSWLASA maintained strict segregation at the McIver Women's Baths (including forbidding male relatives as spectators) as well as regulating swimming costumes for the female competitors. The NSWLASA's active withdrawal of women's swimming competition from the public domain and the strict conditions enforced, caused increasing public decent in the community and, by 1912, by popular demand, segregation at competitive swimming events was abandoned. Despite the end of segregated competition, the McIver Women's Baths were one of the few to retain its gender-specific use during a time when segregated swimming clubs were amalgamating. Operated by the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club since 1923, the baths continue to be a popular swimming venue for a variety of women, including older women, women with disabilities, the Catholic and Islamic community and those who prefer to swim in privacy. In 1995, to reflect its importance to the female community, the site was granted an exemption under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 for a period of 25 years. This has served to cement its purpose as a women's-only area and it is a quality that has widespread support from the women that continue to regularly use this site.  Description  Sited on a rock platform to the south of Coogee Beach, the McIver Women's Baths is a naturally-occurring ocean pool that was deepened and formalised in the 19th century to create a safe and usable swimming facility within the maritime environment. Susceptible to natural tidal and wave movements, the pool is aesthetically positioned on the ocean's edge with panoramic views to the surrounding beaches, bays and cliffs. Accessed from Grants Reserve, the privacy of the baths (and sitting/sun-bathing areas) is maintained by dense landscaping, winding concrete pathways and stairs that lead directly to the water. The baths are also complemented by a number of modest facilities and amenities buildings. = Condition = This site has remained in active use since the 1870s (although there are reports of use as early as the 1830s). Having been exposed to the natural ocean environment and the coastal weather patterns for this period of time, the weather has had a definitive effect on the condition of the baths and the physical fabric of the site. These effects have seen the fabric repaired, renewed or replaced on a number of occasions to ensure that the condition of the baths remain acceptable for its use to continue. The integrity of this site derives, in part, from its natural origins on the rock platform. However, the fabric of the baths and the adjoining facilities has been compromised by the unrelenting coastal environmental factors that surround the site. These effects have seen the fabric repaired, renewed or replaced on a number of occasions. The primary objective of listing the McIver Women's Baths is not to conserve the original or in situ fabric. The replacement or repair (where appropriate) of the in situ fabric will allow the site to continue to be used by the community and it will serve to protect the inherent privacy of the location. The strong conditions of the coastal environment has seen the adjoining fabric (the railings, fences and amenities buildings) already repaired and replaced on a number of occasions. The intention of the listing is not to conserve the current fabric but to see it replaced (when necessary) to ensure thebaths continue to be used.  Heritage listing  As at 5 July 2011, The McIver Women's Baths are of State heritage significance as, reportedly, the only remaining swimming venue (specifically reserved for women) in continuous use in NSW (and, perhaps, Australia). Formally recognised in 1876, but in use since the 1830s, the McIver Women's Baths have been well frequented by the female community as, initially, a safe and naturally secluded place to bathe and, later, as a private venue to swim and learn water safety skills. The baths also have a historical association with the rise of competitive swimming in NSW. Although not used as a venue for competitions, the baths were used by Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie to develop their swimming skills (Durack and Wylie went on to win gold and silver medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games - the first Games to allow women to participate in competitive swimming - the 100m freestyle). The McIver Women's Baths are also particularly significant for their social value to the female community of NSW. Since the early female colonists first utilised this pool in the 1830s, generations of women have visited and used this naturally-occurring and beautiful swimming site. Its privacy as a gender-segregated facility has been a long-held attraction for a range of different women in NSW - including, as an example, mothers and children, elderly women, women with disabilities and women from Islamic and Catholic communities. In 1995, having been granted an exemption under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, the McIver Women's Baths cemented its purpose as a women's area and its ongoing use reflects the high regard the female community continues to have for this site. McIver Women's Baths was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The McIver Women's Baths are of State heritage significance as, reportedly, the only remaining swimming venue (specifically for women) in continuous use in NSW (and, perhaps, Australia). Formally recognised in 1876, but in use since the 1830s, the baths continue to be well frequented by the female community as a safe and naturally secluded place to bathe and as a private venue to swim and learn water safety skills. The McIver Women's Baths also have a historical connection with the rise of competitive swimming in NSW. Although not used as a venue for competitions, the baths were used by Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie to develop their swimming skills (Durack and Wylie went on to become the first women to win gold and silver medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games). When gender-segregation at swimming venues was all but abandoned in the early 20th century, the McIver Women's Baths was one of the very few ocean pools in NSW to retain its use as a women's only facility. This purpose was enforced further in 1995 when the baths were granted an exemption under the Anti- Discrimination Act 1977 to continue as a swimming venue reserved only for the use of women. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The McIver Women's Baths are of State heritage significance for the association with Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie, who first learnt their swimming skills at this venue. Durack and Wylie went on to be the first women to win gold and silver medals, respectively, at the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games - the first Olympic Games to allow women to participate in competitive swimming (the 100m freestyle). Prior to this, the participation of women in competitive swimming in NSW was largely conditional but these restrictions were lifted (in the most part) when Durack and Wylie returned to Sydney as Olympic heroines. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The McIver Women's Baths have heritage significance for the aesthetic juxtaposition of the built form of the baths and the natural environment in which they are set. With the panoramic views of the ocean, the neighbouring bays and the rugged cliffs that surround, the baths have an inherent natural beauty that contributes to its value by the community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The McIver Women's Baths have State heritage significance for its social value to the female community of NSW. In use since the 1830s by the early female colonists, the baths have long been used as a site for recreational bathing, swimming and water safety lessons for generations of Sydney women. The inherent privacy of the location and the beauty of its setting have attracted a range of different women to use the baths. Mothers with children, the elderly or disabled, women from Islamic and Catholic communities or women that prefer to swim in privacy, all continue to frequent the baths today and this popularity and continuity in its use reflects just how highly the site is regarded amongst the female community of NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The McIver Women's Baths have some heritage significance for the technical skills evident in the excavation of the naturally occurring rock platform and its adaptation into the swimming facility in use today. The evident skill in the design and construction of this facility and the consideration given to the natural topography, geography and maritime environment also contributes to the significance of this site. The baths have potential to reveal further information in demonstrating the relationship between the site and the Aboriginal women of the Eora group prior to European settlement of NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The McIver Women's Baths are rare in that they are, possibly, the only swimming facility remaining in NSW (and, perhaps, Australia) that continues to be reserved specifically for the use of women. The McIver Women's Baths are also somewhat rare having been granted an exemption under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977. The baths are one of only 113 sites in NSW exempt under the Act (which includes, in addition to the McIver Women's Baths, only one other bathing facility reserved for women). However, as an ocean pool, the McIver Women's Baths are not rare as there are numerous baths still in use along the NSW coastline. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The McIver Women's Baths are representative of the numerous ocean baths constructed on the natural rock platforms along the NSW coast. This bath is fairly typical of this naturally occurring environment being adapted into a salt-water swimming facility during the late 19th century.

Her maternal grandparents were John Boucher Morris and Louise Kittera (n√©e Van Dyke) Morris. Personal life Heveningham Hall in 1967 On September 1, 1930, Louise was married to the Hon. Andrew Nicholas Armstrong Vanneck (1890‚Äì1965), son of the Hon. William Arcedeckne Vanneck, and his wife, the former Mary Armstrong. Andrew was the younger brother of William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, who was the 17th Governor of Victoria.Peter W. Hammond, editor, The Complete Peerage or a History of the House of Lords and All its Members From the Earliest Times, Volume XIV: Addenda & Corrigenda (Stroud, Gloucestershire, U.K.: Sutton Publishing, 1998), page 35. Their married home was at Heveningham Hall. They had no children, and were divorced in 1933. =Second marriage= Two years after her divorce from Vanneck, she married Captain Ian Campbell (1903‚Äì1973) on November 23, 1935. Campbell's first marriage, to Janet Aitken (daughter of Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook), had ended in divorce in 1934. There was one daughter from Campbell's marriage to Aitken, Lady Jeanne Campbell (1928-2007), who was brought up mainly by her father when her mother returned to Canada without her. Lady Jeanne later married the American writer Norman Mailer in 1962; they divorced shortly thereafter in 1963. Together, Louise and Ian were the parents of two sons: * Ian Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll (1937‚Äì2001), who married Iona Colquhoun, daughter of Sir Ivar Colquhoun, 8th Baronet, and had two children. * Lord Colin Ivar Campbell (born 1946), who married Georgia Arianna Ziadie, a Jamaican-born British writer. During the Second World War, Campbell was in the armed forces and spent some time as a prisoner of war. His wife crossed the Pyrenees to Lisbon, where she helped with relief efforts. Among other things, she arranged for beer and Christmas puddings to be received at the POW camps. Campbell inherited his cousin's dukedom in 1949, making his wife Duchess of Argyll, but they were divorced in 1951. The duke was a notorious spendthrift, and, when asked, Louise is said to have replied \\"He took everything but my trust funds.\\" The duchess filed for divorce because of the duke's adultery with the woman who would become his third wife, the notorious Margaret Whigham Sweeny. =Third marriage= She relocated to the United States following her divorce, and her third marriage was to Robert Clermont Livingston Timpson (1908‚Äì1988), an American investment banker, in 1954. Timpson was the grandson of John Henry Livingston of the prominent Livingston family. They moved into Grasmere, a mansion in Rhinebeck, which she later opened to the public. They divorced in 1963, and the former duchess died in New York in 1970, aged 65. Descendants Through her eldest son, she was the grandmother of Torquhil Campbell, 13th Duke of Argyll (born 1968) and Lady Louise Iona Campbell (born 1972), who married Anthony Burrell and had children.

They have established themselves in the country's politics having established a political dynasty that traces its beginnings to the 1925 election of Mariano Marcos to the Philippine House of Representatives as congressman for the second district of Ilocos Norte; reached its peak during the 21-year reign of Ferdinand Marcos as president of the Philippines that included the declaration of Martial Law throughout the country; and continues today with the political careers of Imelda Marcos, Imee Marcos, and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Imee Marcos has attributed the continued reign of the Marcos family to the inherent feudalism of Philippine culture. Although nominally democratic, Philippine society effectively blocks individual Philippine citizens from having much political power, forcing them to be dependent on powerful figures that social scientists have called \\"bosses\\" or \\"caciques.\\"Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, Cacique Democracy'Benedict Anderson, 'Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams', New Left Review, I (169), May‚ÄìJune 1988 Ferdinand Alexander Marcos III, the most politically prominent of the fourth generation of Marcoses, has argued that political dynasties are simply a \\"natural progression\\" for members of powerful families. Although Article II Section 26 of the current Philippine constitution, promulgated after the Marcoses were ousted from the Philippines in 1986, explicitly prohibits the perpetuation of political dynasties, little legislation has been since been put in place to enforce the provision. The prominence of the Marcos family in Philippine politics has been stopped twice. The first came with the victory of Julio Nalundasan over Mariano Marcos and the subsequent arrest of Ferdinand Marcos for his murder, the publicity for which brought Ferdinand Marcos to the national consciousness and eventually led to his rise to power. The second, when Filipinos got tired of the plundering and murder, was when the Marcos family was deposed from Malaca√±ang by the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution and exiled to Hawaii. After Ferdinand Marcos' 1989 death, the remaining members of the family were allowed to return to the Philippines to face various corruption charges in 1992. However, they were able to return to political power that same year, to the dismay of the Filipino people, with the election of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as congressman for the second district of Ilocos Norte. At least one other branch of the family, that of Ferdinand Sr.'s sister Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, is also in politics, with her son Michael Marcos Keon having been elected board member in 2004 and governor of Ilocos Norte in 2007.Michael Keon: From sports to politics, Manila Standard Today, May 19, 2007.  History  = Beginnings of the Marcos dynasty (1925-1945) =  The Second Congressional District of Ilocos Norte  The Marcos political dynasty is generally acknowledged to have been founded when Mariano Marcos y Rubio (1897‚Äì1945) was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives as congressman for the second district of Ilocos Norte in 1925, although his father Fabian Marcos also served in local politics, as Gobernadorcillo (the equivalent of today's Mayor) of Batac in the days after the Philippine Revolution. Mariano Marcos became a prominent member of the house, serving as chairman of the house committee on ways and means, and as member of the committees on public instruction, public works, public estate, and mines and natural resources. In the election of 1932, however, he ran against Emilio Medina of Laoag and Julio Nalundasan of Batac. With the Batac vote split between him and Nalundasan, Medina won the house seat.  The murder of Julio Nalundasan  Mariano Marcos fought a highly contested election against Nalundasan for the same seat in 1935, and Nalundasan won by a landslide. A day after his proclamation, Nalundasan mocked Marcos publicly, organizing a mock funeral parade that ended in front of the Marcos house to show that Mariano's political career was \\"dead\\". On that same night, Nalundasan was shot dead by a sniper when he stepped out onto his back porch to brush his teeth. Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo all became suspects. Mariano and Pio were cleared of the crime, but Ferdinand Marcos and Quirino Lizardo were arrested. Aware of the publicity he could get out of the national coverage of the trial, Ferdinand represented himself before the court, with the lawyers hired by the family for the trial guiding him in his legal arguments. Ferdinand initially lost the case and he and Lizardo were convicted. Public interest in the case, however, led to the Supreme Court of the Philippines eventually overthrowing the conviction, with Associate Justice Jos√© P. Laurel arguing that it would have been a waste for someone with Ferdinand's legal talents to merely rot in a prison cell. The trial, and the overturning of the conviction turned Ferdinand Marcos into the \\"most famous young man in the islands\\", with then- President Manuel L. Quezon arranging to meet the boy and suggesting that he use the newfound popularity to enter Philippine politics. Before that could happen, however, the Marcoses were overtaken by the events of World War II.  The execution of Mariano Marcos  Mariano Marcos was executed in the closing days of the war, on March 8, 1945. The Marcos family's account claims that he was executed by the Japanese, but other eyewitness accounts say that he was caught by Philippine guerillas, tried as a Japanese collaborator, and executed through dismemberment using two carabaos. = Ferdinand Marcos and the rise of the Marcos dynasty (1949‚Äì1986) = Ferdinand Marcos at a 1980s press conference, where he denied rumors that he was sick; he turned out to be suffering from complications due to lupus.  The rise of Ferdinand Marcos  Because the Nalundasan murder trial resulting drew wide public attention in the years immediately prior to the war, Mariano's son Ferdinand was in an ideal political position to enter politics in the postwar years. Ferdinand Marcos' rise to power was dramatic. He served three terms in Mariano's own former position as the Philippine House of Representatives as the Congressman for the second district of Ilocos Norte, from 1949 to 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, he served in the Philippine Senate, where he became Senate President until he won the Philippine Presidential Election of 1965 to become the tenth President of the Philippines, staying in the position for 21 years despite the eight year (two four year terms) limitation set by the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines by placing the country under Martial Law in 1972. Ferdinand Marcos' political prominence would pave the way for other members of the Marcos family to be appointed or elected to various national elections - what would eventually become known as the Marcos dynasty.  Dovie Beams and the expansion of the Conjugal Dictatorship  Some time in 1968, Ferdinand Marcos began an affair with Nashville actress Dovie Beams. When Marcos got tired of the dalliance in early 1970 and broke up with Beams, the actress released sex tapes of herself and President Marcos. Author Seagrave recounts that: Student protesters at the University of the Philippines commandeered the campus radio station and broadcast a looped tape; soon the entire nation was listening in astonishment to President Marcos begging Dovie Beams to perform oral sex. For over a week the President's hoarse injunctions boomed out over university loudspeakers.Seagrave, The Marcos Dynasty, 1988. Historians note that Ferdinand Marcos' president's wife Imelda Marcos reacted to the humiliation by aggressively pursuing government positions. This was later confirmed by Economic Planning Minister Gerardo Sicat in his biography of Prime Minister Cesar Virata, where he recounted that the creation of the Metro Manila Commission and the appointment of Imelda Marcos as its head in the position of Governor of Metro Manila was a direct result of Marcos attempting to placate his wife's tantrums after the Dovie beams affair. Imelda Marcos held the position until the Marcos family was deposed in 1986, and would later be concurrently appointed to the Marcos cabinet as Minister of Human Settlements from 1978‚Äì1986. In addition, she snagged a seat as Assemblyman for Region IV-A to the Batasan Pambansa from 1978 to 1984.  The other Marcoses  Ferdinand's sister Elizabeth Marcos-Keon became Governor of Ilocos Norte from 1971‚Äì1983. The Marcos couple's firstborn, Imee Marcos, was appointed chairman of the Kabataang Barangay from 1975 to 1986, and was Assemblyman to the Batasang Pambansa for Ilocos Norte from 1984 to 1986. Secondborn Ferdinand Marcos Jr. become Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte from 1980 to 1983 and Governor of that same province from 1983‚Äì1986. In March 2018, Fortuna Marcos Barba, the last surviving sister of Ferdinand Marcos, died. She and her husband Marcellino Barba are said to have made a fortune from government logging concessions given to her by Ferdinand Marcos. Only his brother Pacifico Marcos remains alive. = The People Power Revolution, and the exile of the Marcoses (1986‚Äì1991)= Ferdinand Marcos campaigning for President in the 1986 Snap elections. As a result of the economic collapse brought about by the assassination of Ninoy Aquino in 1983, the Marcos family was removed from power by civilian protests during the 1986 People Power Revolution. Fearful of a scenario in which Marcos' presence in the Philippines would lead to a civil war, the Reagan administration withdrew its support for the Marcos government, and flew Marcos and a party of about 80 individuals‚Äîthe extended Marcos family and a number of close associates - from the Philippines to Hawaii despite Marcos' objections. All the Marcos children‚ÄîImee, Marcos Jr., Irene, and young Aimee‚Äîwere on the flight. The exiles stayed at Hickam Air Force Base at the expense of the US Government. A month later, the marcoses into a pair of residences in Makiki Heights, Honolulu, which were registered to Marcos cronies Antonio Floirendo and Bienvenido and Gliceria Tantoco. President Corazon Aquino eventually allowed the members of the Marcos family to return to the Philippines after the death of Ferdinand Marcos, supposedly so that they could face various corruption charges. = Return of the Marcoses (1991‚Äìpresent)= Imee Marcos with her father Ferdinand some time during the latter's 21 year reign as Philippine president.  Political offices after returning to the Philippines  Within a year of returning to the Philippines, Imelda Marcos was running for president in the 1992 Philippine presidential election, finishing 5th out of 7 candidates. In that same year Marcos Jr. ran in a much smaller local election rather than a national race, easily regaining the family's traditional post of Congressman for the Second District of Ilocos Norte. Since then, Imelda, Ferdinand Jr., and Imee Marcos have run for numerous posts, alternatingly winning posts including the house seat for the Second District of Ilocos Norte, the house seat for the Second District of Ilocos Norte, the governorship of Ilocos Norte. Ferdinand Jr. became a Senator from 2010 to 2016, and ran for the post of Vice President during the 2016 Philippine presidential election, but narrowly lost to Vice President Leni Robredo.  Marcos historical revisionism  Historians, journalists, other observers of Philippine politics have noted that the political rehabilitation of the Marcoses has been made possible through \\"Marcos revisionism\\" - a systematic effort to revise the public's perception of the history of martial law and the Marcos administration. Philippine government, civil society, and academic institutions like the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the University of the Philippines Diliman Department of History, the Ateneo de Manila University, the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, and the Philippine government's Presidential Commission on Good Government say that the myths perpetuated Marcos Revisionism include: * denial or downplaying of the tortures and murders that took place during martial law; * the myth that the Marcos period was a \\"golden age\\" rather than a period of debt driven growth and corruption-triggered collapse; * the myth that all the victims of martial law were communists or communist sympathizers; and * the myth that the children of Ferdinand Marcos, who reached the age of the majority a few years after the declaration of martial law - were too young to know about the abuses of the martial law era. Some historiographers such as Filomeno Aguilar Jr. attribute the rise of Marcos revisionism to the dearth of comprehensive, in-depth scholarly work on the history of the Marcos family and of Martial Law. While there is a significant body of scholarly literature on these subjects, it mostly takes the form of collections of papers, rather than comprehensive scholarly works.

Although this took place at a government event, the text of the sign reads: \\"offered by President Ferdinand Marcos.\\" * Ferdinand Marcos: Member of the Philippine House of Representatives from Ilocos Norte's Second District (1949‚Äì1959); Member of the Philippine Senate (1959‚Äî1965); tenth President of the Philippines (1965‚Äì1986).

It was the only second collection since John Galliano's dismissal from the house. The ladylike silhouettes referenced the Dior archives. According to Style.com, haute couture was a major influence on the collection, with wider necklines, wrapped bodices, bubble skirts, and bar jackets in gazar, organza, silk, and tulle. The palette ranged from graphic black and white to softer pale pink and blue with pops of red. Design details included chevron pleats, v-necks, and ribbons. Described by Vogue UK as demure, proper, and understated, the collection evoked the fifties' glamour. Makeup artist Pat McGrath created a look that she told Allure was ‚Äúall about a classic, beautiful red lip, done in a modern way.‚Äù Hair stylist Orlando Pita rolled the models' hair up in back with a clean side part.

The collection debuted amid rumors that Creative Director Bill Gaytten, who after working alongside John Galliano for 17 years and succeeding his predecessor's scandalous exit one year prior, would soon be replaced by Haider Ackerman or Raf Simons. The silhouette focused on a cinched waist with fuller skirts and peplum jackets. A prominent theme was the juxtaposition of soft and hard. Dichotic influences paired masculine tailoring with ballet femininity. Draped leather separates gave an edgier appeal to midi-length tutu skirts.

It was Creative Director Raf Simons‚Äôs debut ready-to-wear collection for the house, which he joined in April 2012. According to the program notes, Simons‚Äôs fourteen-minute presentation was inspired by freedom and liberation. The concept harkened back to Dior‚Äôs mission to free women from wartime style. \\"He embraced the feminine, the complex and the emotional; an idea of freedom and what had gone before,\\" read the notes. Merging his aesthetic with the heritage house, Simons reconstructed the Dior's classic hourglass silhouette. For daytime, the hemlines remained short, but ankle-length for evening. Prominent silhouettes were architectural and featured fitted blazers, strapless dresses, and balloon skirts. This season's palette included black, ivory, charcoal, red, fuchsia, orange, and yellow. Fabrics used ranged from wool and organdy to tulle, silk, and satin. Daria Strokous opened the runway show of 53 looks to a David Bowie-filled soundrack.

Fall 2013  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2013 Runway Show was presented on February 28, 2013. For his sophomore collection, Creative Director Raf Simons was inspired by art for this collection, specifically Andy Warhol's early works. Warhol's spidery, graphic drawings were reinterpreted on embroidered dresses and embossed bags. According to the program notes, the show was inspired by the creative director's and the founder's mutual interest in art. Dior began in art galleries representing Dali and Giacometti. While Dior was obsessed with Belle Epoque, Simons focused on mid-century artists. \\"For me Warhol made so much sense,\\" explained Simons in the notes. \\"I was interested in the delicacy and sensitivity in the early work he did, I was drawn to that graphic style naturally in this collection. It was that notion of hand work and personal signature that fitted throughout.\\" Laurie Anderson provided the runway soundtrack. The tented runway show was presented at Les Invalides. The setting included enormous mirrored spheres, which reflected a runway that had been painted with blue skies and white clouds. Carolina Sjostrand opened the runway show of 47 looks. Sasha Loss, Fei Fei Sun, Kati Nescher, Amanda Murphy, Catherine McNeil, Elise Crombez, Bette Franke, Anouck Lepere, and Kasia Struss were amongst the models who walked the show. Janice Alida closed the presentation.

He really surprises you every time.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love the knitwear the most. Maybe because I never saw it on a Dior catwalk,‚Äù observed Battaglia. ‚ÄúThe black and white, cable-knit, yes, I like the skirt. I thought it was chic‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a new Lady Dior. She‚Äôs also a contemporary women. You can‚Äôt all the time be on high heels. Sometimes you want to be in flats. It‚Äôs not just about being fabulous, just about being what you feel real.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe collection is completely not defined by one silhouette or one material or one coloration,‚Äù explained Simons. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of juxtaposition between things that are very much in contrast as well. Something very surreal with something very real. Something very soft and very romantic and dreamy with something that can be harder sometimes‚Ä¶ I was interested in having a collection which speaks a lot about feelings and emotions, whether if it‚Äôs like happiness or sadness. Things related to reality or things related to dreams and I thought about approaching it almost like a personal scrapbook. The reason why I think I want to go there now is to have more dialogue, you know, like let‚Äôs talk about what we see and what we feel.‚Äù  Spring 2014  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2014 Runway Show was presented on September 26, 2013 at a tented Musee Rodin. The Creative Director staged his presentation against the backdrop of a garden landscape. According to the program notes, the collection referred to as ‚ÄúTrans-Dior‚Äù was a cross-section of Christian Dior and Raf Simons, where Dior's New Look silhouette would be transformed. Featured silhouettes included floral pleated dresses, tailored shorts, deconstructed shirts, diaphonous t- shirts, and curved peplum jackets. Many of the pieces were embroidered with slogans, such as \\"hyperrealness in the daytime,\\" \\"Alice Garden,\\" and \\"primrose path.\\" Hemlines fell just at or below the knee. The palette was black, brown, blue, pink, orange, yellow, and white, with floral patterns throughout. This season's fabrics ranged from brocade, jacquard, wool, and organza to cotton, jersey, silk, and tulle with sequin and crystal embellishments. Daria Strokous opened the runway show of 76 looks. Sasha Luss, Kaitlin Aas, Julia Nobis, Josepehine Le Tutour, Kasia Struss, Daiane Conterato, Fei Fei Sun, Marine Deleeuw, Devon Windsor, Alana Zimmer, and Maartje Verhoef were amongst the models who walked the show. Natalia Vodianova, Marisa Berenson, Olga Kurylenko, Isabelle Huppert, Alexandra Richards, Eva Riccobono, Garance Dor√©, Michel Denisot, Giovanna Battaglia, Franca Sozzani, Anna Dello Russo, Lou de La√¢ge, Ni Ni, Miroslava Duma, Ulyana Sergeenko, Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand, and Angelababy attended the show. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about ‚ÄòLes Femmes Fleurs‚Äô and it's about nature and gardens, but the big difference, I think, is that how he perceived that and translated that,‚Äù explained Simons to Now Fashion after the show. ‚ÄúI see it now evolving to also something very different, a very different form language, a very different attitude, more modernity, more futurism, but still with the same kind of principles, still with the romance, and still with the softness and still with the movement in all kinds of femininity. So in that sense it‚Äôs the same.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt make very modern, a shape that we know, like it‚Äôs a Dior, but he made it completely twisted in his way with a lot of even humor, because he mixed the colors in a different way,‚Äù noted Sozzani. ‚ÄúWhat I wanted to do with the show was take the literal DNA of the house ‚ÄòLes Femmes Fleurs‚Äô gardens, beauty, but I wanted to have the aesthetic difference, even if the psychology was exactly the same‚Äù explained Simons. ‚ÄúI think with this collection, I didn‚Äôt really want to specifically split up the idea of the aesthetic related to one culture. I think in that sense it‚Äôs more abstracted for me, and that is what I think about how he looked at it, rather simple or rather pure, but kind of a global message to women‚Äîwherever they come from, whomever they are. I don‚Äôt want to take one theme. It doesn‚Äôt feel right for me, because I don‚Äôt want that people can only perceive it in one way.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mixture of very sort of vigueur and feminine,‚Äù observed Berenson. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very linear. He has sort of structure, but you know, interesting shapes, interesting melange of fabrics. I think he‚Äôs a very modern man.‚Äù  Fall 2014  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2014 Runway Show was presented on February 27, 2014. This season was a luxurious interpretation of sportswear with masculinely tailored garments that didn't sacrifice femininity. Hemlines varied from knee to floor-length. Silhouettes included double-breasted jackets, oversized coats, slim pants, asymmetrical skirts, and double dresses. The color story featured black, midnight blue, cobalt, navy, pink, red, burgundy, green, yellow, camel, blue, and ivory. Fabrics ranged from cashmere, cotton, knitwear, wool, and flannel to leather, astrakhan, silk, satin, and nylon adorned with Swarovski crystals. Kinga Rajzak opened the runway show of 55 looks. Mariacarla Boscono, Daiane Conterato, Kaitlin Aas, Sasha Luss, Daria Strokous, Julia Nobis, Valery Kaufman, Kati Nescher, Anna Ewers, Ginta Lapina, Lexi Boling, Marine Deleeuw, Fei Fei Sun, and Manuela Frey were amongst the models who walked the show.

Reality is not always so glamorous. So it‚Äôs nothing to do with rejecting something. It‚Äôs really like adding and offering possibilities. I know where I am, but I also never forget where I came from‚Äîso I think that it‚Äôs not possible for me to design without always fusing those two quite different worlds. I think I just do what I have to do.‚Äù  Spring 2015  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2015 Runway Show was presented on September 26, 2014 in a mirrored tent at the Louvre's Cour Carr√©e. Vogue described the set as referencing the world of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Women's Wear Daily noted the disparate elements as a street to stratosphere collection, merging eighteenth-century French royal court silhouettes with more futuristic science-fiction fabrics. Featured silhouettes included slim pants, a-line skirts, tailored jackets, bombers, fitted sheaths, and maxi dresses. The hemlines fell above and below the knee. This season's color story included white, black, brown, navy, green, pink, acid yellow, fuchsia, and orange. The materials included tech fabrics, leather, wool, cotton, knit, linen, silk, satin, and jersey. Design details took an architectural approach, with floral embroideries, quilting, and structured knits. Lis van Velthoven opened the runway show of 50 looks. Karolin Wolter, Julia Nobis, Yumi Lambert, Fei Fei Sun, Daiane Conterato, Daria Strokous, Maarte Verhoef, Mica Arganaraz, Natalie Westling, and Malaika Firth were amongst the models who walked the show.

As Simons said to Vogue, ‚ÄúI like very much this juxtaposition between something which is very historical and which can become very heavy in terms of materialization and in terms of printing, and something very clean and simple and very summery... Some looks I approached very abstract like the first outcomes. I think they are like very simple modern looks and there was a suggestion of the past purely by adding a certain fabric. And then further in the show it‚Äôs also, of course, very much linked to the way things were constructed in the past. Christian Dior was a very architectural designer. So I thought we had already worked a lot on his silhouette. I thought I want to investigate history where architectural aspects of garments were very interesting. And that‚Äôs what brought me to, for example, top coats, which are very architecturally constructed, which were actually for men back in the days. I like the fact that Christian Dior has such a kind of historical approach, but it will always be my goal to also bring a lot of variety... we even injected a lot of things that have nothing to do with Christian Dior, like the skater pant, for example, or an easy sweater, to just kind of have a little bit more juxtaposition of garments that can have very different kind of aesthetic, but it‚Äôs also I think, how women these days are very much dressing themselves.‚Äù  Fall 2015  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2015 Runway Show was presented on March 6, 2015 to the soudtrack of Throbbing Gristle's ‚ÄúHot on the Heels of Love‚Äù. at the Louvre. For fall, Simons wanted to explore the Dior woman's primal extincts. Silhouettes included pantsuits, double-breasted jackets, and jumpsuits, paired with thigh-high boots and lucite heels. More than half of the looks were topped off with outerwear separates. Simons partnered with the fabric firm Kvadrat to develop tweeds and other fabrics for the collection. According to the program notes, Simons wanted \\"that feeling of sensory overload in the collection, with this animalistic sexual woman wearing a new kind of camouflage.\\" \\"I wanted the collection to deal with nature and femininity in a different way... Away from the garden and the flower to something more liberated, darker and more sexual.\\" Simons told Vogue, ‚ÄúThis is the second season where I start to realize that couture can be an activator of something and then from couture you take it an approach it for ready to wear styles... It needed a couple of years to feel free enough to also dare to release from the heritage of silhouettes. I still like to do something which was very strong nature suggested, but maybe less pamfleur and garden and romantic, but something more savage, urban, a little bit more sexual. For me, this is very feminine, and very sensual and sexual, but maybe less romantic in the way how a lot of people perceive it, but not necessarily for me.‚Äù ‚ÄúColor for Fall/Winter is less intuitive, so I find this bright color kind of a real hsot in the arm‚Äù, observed Linda Fargo. ‚ÄúThe opening pieces, those were easy, but you know, I like how Raf moved it through though.‚Äù Marylou Moll opened the runway show of 56 looks. Grace Hartzel, Lia Pavlova, Lexi Boling, Julia Nobis, Mica Arganaraz, Hanne Gaby Odiele, Julia Bergshoeff, Maarte Verhoef, Fei Fei Sun, Amanda Murphy were amongst the models who walked the show. Katya Ledneva closed the presentation. Lorde, Kanye West, Delphine Arnault, Dakota Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Christopher Kane, Diane von Furstenberg, Carla Sozzani, Azzedine Ala√Øa, Stella Tennant, Mario Testino, Patrick Demarchelier, Kris Van Assche, Aymeline Valade, Marisa Berenson, Laetitia Casta, Hanneli Mustaparta, Marie-Jos√©e Croze, Camille Rowe, Olympia Scarry, Melissa George, Anna Dello Russo, Olivia Palermo, Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis, Laure Heriard Dubreuil, Miroslava Duma, and Chiara Ferragni attended the show.  Spring 2016  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2016 Runway Show was presented on October 2, 2015 inside a blue-hued delphinium-filled tent, 400,000 to be exact, along the Rue de Rivoli within the courtyard of the Carr√© du Louvre. The collection was inspired by Peter Weir‚Äôs 1975 film Picnic at Hanging Rock. Simons told Vogue UK that he wanted ‚Äúthe collection to have a purity to it.‚Äù The artistic director continued to reinterpret Dior's 1947 New Look hourglass silhoutte, juxtaposing masculine and feminine elements, while incorporating Victorian and Edwardian design techniques. The collection included cami knickers, chemise tops, embroidered military jackets, and pleated asymmetrical skirts. The palette featured black, ecru, brown, pink, violet, and coral. Materials used included silk, cotton, wool, organza, nylon, chiffon, and leather. Design details varied from scalloped edges, rounded shoulders, and pleated hems to floral embroideries, sequin embellishments, and three-dimensional appliques. Sofia Mechetner opened the runway show of 50 looks. Julia Nobis, Mica Arganaraz, Ala Sekula, Greta Varlese, Odette Pavlova, Estelle Chen, and Lexi Boling were amongst the models who walked the show. Julie Hoomans closed the presentation. Rihanna, Elizabeth Olsen, Leelee Sobieski, Aymeline Valade, Miroslava Duma, Hanne Gaby Odiele, Marisa Berenson, Emilia Clarke, Cressida Bonas, and Erin O‚ÄôConnor attended the show. \\"When you arrive and you see all the flowers they‚Äôve put, the magic starts right from the entrance, observed Chiara Mastroianni. ‚ÄúAnd the only thing I can expect is to have fun and to be taken to another world. Fantasy!‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted to stay with a lot of things that we have been working on in the last couple of seasons, especially in the couture, but are now, make them ready for ready-to-wear,‚Äù explained Simons. ‚ÄúAnd so in that sense, I like to call it a very, very sensitive, pure, romantic futurism‚Äîfuturistic romanticism. I wanted to do something, which is a little more pure than what we usually do. I think I feel like that because of what I think was happening to the fashion world in general. Things become, they go to a peak of like overexposure and overdecorated, and seen on the internet and clicked away a split second. Things are so instant and so fast and then they‚Äôre pushed away and next and pushed away and next. And I think I‚Äôve been trying to build up something that there was gonna be a strong identity again.‚Äù  Fall 2016  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2016 Runway Show was presented on March 4, 2016 at the Louvre. The domed set interior featured arches and a mirrored wall with matte silver and oxblood velvet. The cavernous setting created an environment conducive to the reverberations of a pulsating runway soundtrack. With the departure of Raf Simons, Lucie Meier, and Serge Ruffieux, part of Simons' former team, unveiled a collection marked by black suiting, high-waisted pencil skirts, and softer jackets. Vogue Runway described many of the shapes as fashion-forward with flounce accents, higher necklines, and leg-of-mutton sleeves. There were also graphic elements, highlighted here with colored off-the-shoulder furs. The palette included orange, lavender, lime, hot pink, yellow, grey, and black. New proportions gave way to mini jackets, deep slits, and peplum dresses, while bare shoulders read as more feminine and seductive. Women's Wear Daily referenced the collection's contradictions with asymmetry and a mix of patterns and prints. The beauty looks took on an androgynous, punkish, rebellious feeling, with Gothic elements. Dior Creative Image Director Peter Phillips created a new shade called Poison, a deep purple, for the Rouge Dior lipstick line. Hairstylist Guido Palau created a 1920s-influenced style. Liv Mason Pearson opened the runway show of 57 looks. Camile Hurel, Lineisy Montero, Binx Walton, Jamie Bochert, Teddy Quinlivan, Mica Arganaraz, Kendall Jenner, Vera van Erp, Ella Wennstr√∂m, and Julia Nobis were amongst the models who walked the show.

Spring 2017  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2017 Runway Show was presented on September 30, 2016 at the Musee Rodin. This season marked the debut of Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first female creative director in the 70-year history of the house. Chiuri had previously spent seven years at Valentino, where she was part of a design team that quadrupled the company's sales. Key pieces included lacy blouses, net dresses, tulle skirts, pea coats, and bar jackets. The creative director also showed a slogan T-shirt that read ‚ÄúWe should all be Feminists,‚Äù which references Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Ted 2012 TEDx talk and subsequent book. Chiuri drew inspiration from the 1976 film L‚ÄôInnocente. Prominent shapes varied from mini bustier dresses and long, lace dresses to circle skirts and masculine trousers paired with bar jackets. The collection opened with a series of modern fencing-inspired pieces, but also paid homage to her predecessors with heritage elements. Dew Magazine noted that many of the gossamer gowns shown harkened back to her tenure at Valentino. Fabrics featured cotton, tulle, silk, lace, chiffon, cashmere, denim, and leather. Embroideries referenced zodiac signs, tarot card symbols, florals and bees. The palette included black, white, blue, pink, and red. \\"I want to create fashion that resembles the women of today,\\" Chiuri noted. \\"Fashion that corresponds to their changing needs, freed from the stereotypical categories of masculine and feminine.\\" \\"I wanted to overcome the traditional man/woman, tailored/ casual, reason/emotion, stereotypes... And I precisely thought of a wardrobe which is not just feminine, but feminist, where the distinctions between mind and heart no longer exist and thinking merges with action.\\" \\"When you are a woman making clothes for women, fashion is not just about how you look, but how you feel and think,‚Äù Chiuri told The Guardian. ‚ÄúFeminism for me is about equal opportunities... If I am going to stand for something, I would like to stand for this idea: that if you are a woman you can have these opportunities in life.‚Äù Ruth Bell opened the runway show of 64 looks. Kris Grikaite, Lexi Boling, Torry Zherebtcova, Caroline Schurch, and Nora Attal were amongst the models who walked the show. Cara Taylor closed the presentation.

Fall 2017  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2017 Runway Show was presented on March 3, 2017 at the Musee Rodin. With a mood board that featured Picasso, Georges Braque, and Nina Simone, Maria Grazia Chiuri unveiled her sophomore military- influenced ready-to-wear collection. The collection was underscored by a sense of gender fluidity. Chiuri's focus was on sportier daywear with oversized anoraks, bomber jackets, hooded tunics, cutaway capes, loose trousers, and flounced maxi skirts. She referenced the Dior archives, reinterpreting classic suiting as a modern-day uniform. There was also a conspicuous use of logos. The palette included black, white, and various shades of blue. Fabrics varied from denim, cotton, and wool to velvet, jersey, chiffon, and taffeta. Ruth Bell opened the runway show of 69 looks. Carol Paes, Aira Ferreira, Lineisy Montero, Teddy Quinlivan, Binx Walton, Jing Wen, Natalia Trnkova, and Ellen Rosa were amongst the models who walked the show. Camille Hurel closed the presentation. Karlie Kloss, Cl√©mence Po√©sy, Winnie Harlow, Camille Rowe, Sienna Miller, Olivia Palermo, Daisy Lowe, Ruth Wilson, Eva Herzigov√°, Kate Moss, Aymeline Valade, Swizz Beatz, Alicia Keys, Uma Thurman, and Rosamund Pike attended the show. ‚ÄúI need to speak to the millennials, and understand this generation, because I want to support them,‚Äù Chiuri told Vogue during a preview. ‚ÄúI want to build a wardrobe. I don‚Äôt believe in one uniform for everyone, but that everyone needs to find her own uniform, in which to express and protect herself.‚Äù  Spring 2018  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2018 Runway Show was presented on September 26, 2017 at the Musee Rodin. Key ensembles included 70s patchwork jeans, leather jumpsuits, black pantsuits, and sheer dresses. Sasha Pivovarova opened the runway show of 80 looks, and Ruth Bell closed it. Women's Wear Daily noted the dichotomy of the political undertones and social consciousness of the collection, while trying to attract the new Millennial customer base. Chiuri searched the Dior archives, and was also inspired by Linda Nochlin‚Äôs 1971 essay, ‚ÄúWhy have there not been great women artists?\\" - so much so that Sasha Pivovarova opened the show wearing a top with that embroidered message. As told to Women's Wear Daily during a preview, ‚ÄúI would like to involve the young generation with this book, because at times, I think women are not so confident in themselves... Sometimes the problem is not on the outside; it is on the inside.‚Äù Bridging the gap between traditional and contemporary, the collection paired more relaxed silhouettes, T-shirts, denim trousers, and striped nautical tops with bar jackets, leather jumpsuits, and pleated tulle skirts. Fabrics varied from silk, chiffon, and tulle to leather, poplin, and fur. The palette included white, navy, black, and red. A copy of Nochlin's essay was placed on each seat. Chiuri also drew inspiration from French feminist sculptor Niki de Saint Phalle. The collection had a sixties-seventies influence with references to Paco Rabanne and Barbarella. In a preview with Vogue UK, Chiuri lamented at all of the attention she had received as Dior's first female creative director. ‚ÄúI think, in a way, when people point it out, they‚Äôre not recognising that I have a talent. I‚Äôm not here because I‚Äôm a woman, but because I‚Äôm good at what I do.‚Äù \\"It's strange for me to be talking about this argument still, but now we have to speak up again! It's a culture that's inside us... Niki de Saint Phalle lived in a time when it was very difficult for women to express themselves. But the new generation, I think, has to fight with themselves to change these ideas, too.\\"  Fall 2018  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2018 Runway Show was presented on February 27, 2018 at the Musee Rodin. With 2018 marking the 50th anniversary of the 1968 youth revolts, Chiuri drew parallelisms between then and now in politics and fashion. Once again the references of the 60s' political unrest and protest remained an underlying themes, but this season Chiuri culled the archives with her modern-day interpretation on patchwork, piecing together reproductions of Dior archival prints. The references to feminism, women's studies, and gender equality were especially notable given the #MeToo and Time's Up campaigns. The backdrop for the runway show was wallpapered in magazine clippings from 1968, when women were ironically protesting the house for not selling miniskirts. The palette included black, blue, brown, red, green, and silver. Featured fabrics ranged from wool, velvet, and shearling to knits, chiffon, and leather. Tailored jackets were paired with long pleated skirts, while oversized parkas and capes were layered over fluid dresses. Chiuri told Vogue Paris, ‚ÄúThe young generation changed the world, so the references we are using at the back and all around the show were an important moment in fashion... Couture houses either adapted or closed. It was the beginning of pr√™t-a-porter and the time of Miss Dior.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to speak about feminine craftsmanship, and other works like knitwear and embroidery,‚Äù Chiuri explained. ‚ÄúPatchwork is like another kind of print. I had 60 days to research the authenticity of lace, embroidery and patchwork, paint, craftsmanship, even fake fur made from wool.\\" Dylan Penn, Winnie Harlow, Jeanne Damas, Olga Kurylenko, Cara Delevingne, Olivia Palermo, Bianca Jagger, and Isabelle Huppert. attended the show.  Spring 2019  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2019 Runway Show was presented on September 24, 2018 in the Bois de Boulogne. Held inside a dimly-lit tent, with a 1,700 square foot platform and runway at the Hippodrome de Longchamp, this presentation was set against the backdrop of a black box with parquet floors. Built around the themes of grace and freedom, the collection's silhouettes were inspired by choreographers Pina Bauch, Martha Graham, and Isadora Duncan. As told to Vogue, ‚ÄúI wanted to speak about dance with a different point of view,‚Äù said Creative Director Maria Grazia Chiuri backstage. ‚ÄúI think that dance and fashion are very close, for they both speak about the body.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúModern choreographers speak about freedom.‚Äù With a palette of greys, pales, and nudes, dance-inspired pieces were the foundation with deboned bustiers, silk jerseys, leotards, ethereal tulle gowns, lace, feminine florals, and ballet slippers. Israeli Choreographer Sharon Eyal and members of her dance company opened the presentation with a conceptual dance piece as rose petals fell from the ceiling. As told to Vogue Italia, ‚ÄúI decided to make a collection with this inspiration, and it has been nice to see dance from this different point of view with a collaboration. It is sometimes important to collaborate with an artist who can give you another point of view about your job,‚Äù said Chiuri. ‚ÄúSharon was fascinated by the craft and the lightness of Dior, so we decided together to build this collection as a performance. That is not so easy, because for fashion you need to show the dress and you need light and space.‚Äù Pietro Beccari, Dior's CEO, explained this new vision. ‚ÄúI think today the show is more and more not just a display of clothes ‚Äì you want it to create emotion,‚Äù the executive said. ‚ÄúMaria Grazia and I love this. We are Italian, full of emotions. I want people to stand up, saying first, ‚ÄòFantastic clothes!‚Äô but also, ‚ÄòI got something out of it.‚Äô‚Äù Selena Forrest, Sora Choi, Zoe Thaets, Nora Attal, Lineisy Montero, Felice Noordhoff, Lara Mullen, and Adwoa Aboah walked in the show. The audience of 2,000 guests included Camille Rowe, Shailene Woodley, Blake Lively, Olivia Cooke, Dree Hemingway, Jeanne Damas, and Angelababy.  Fall 2019  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fall 2019 Runway Show was presented on February 26, 2019 in a box behind the Musee Rodin. Creative Director, Maria Grazia Chiuri invited Italian concept artist and activist, Tomaso Binga to read an Italian poem about feminine victory over patriarchy. Messages of female empowerment endured with the show‚Äôs opening look, a ‚ÄúSisterhood is Global‚Äù t-shirt paired with a grey skirt and corset belt. Inspired by the British subcultures of the Fifties and Ken Russell‚Äôs ‚ÄúPhotographs of British Teddy Girls,‚Äù with a nod to the new Dior exhibit at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Silhouttes included velvet drain-pipe pants, sheer princess skirts, Edwardian jackets, rompers, bustiers, and boy shorts accented by sequins, jacquards, three-dimensional flowers, and fringe. The collection was waist-centric with lean sweaters, tulle skirts, tartans, and buffalo plaids. Chuiri said of the house's famed New Look aesthetic, ‚ÄúHonestly, this silhouette is not easy for me, because of some ways, it feels special and special in the past of Dior. The materials were very heavy,‚Äù she told WWD during a preview. She's determined to de-chichi it and put in an everyday, sportswear context. Eva Herzigova Karlie Kloss, Jennifer Lawrence, and Cara Delevingne attended the presentation.

Lara Mullen, Binx Walton, Anok Yai, Fran Summers, Jing Wen, Kris Grikaite, and Sara Grace Wallerstedt walked in the show. Ruth Bell closed the presentation.  Spring 2020  The Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Spring 2020 Runway Show was presented on September 24, 2019 at the Hippodrome de Longchamps Racetrack. Creative Director, Maria Grazia Chiuri collaborated with Coloco, a Parisian environmental design company, she sought out for both their inspirational and sustainable approach. With an ‚Äúinclusive garden‚Äù design and layout of 160 heterogenous trees, which would later be donated and distributed across various community garden projects, Chiuri set a metaphorical mantra. ‚ÄúRespect for diversity and nature will set us free.‚Äù Intersecting sustainabinility with technology, guests could also scan a QR code on the trees to learn where they would be replanted. The designer also noted the brand‚Äôs namesake sister Catherine Dior as inspiration, who after surviving a concentration camp during World War II, became an acclaimed gardener and botanist. Layered garden party ensembles and utilitarian silhouettes paired boxy jackets, dropped crotch pants, diaphonous long skirts, and embroidered dresses in an earthtone palette and muted florals. Raffia dresses, straw hats, and embroidered enhanced the collection‚Äôs textural, woodsy elements. As told to WWD, ‚ÄúWe have to use creativity, but we are more conscious about what we do‚Ä¶,‚Äù she said during a preview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that the message is correct.‚Äù Chiuri acknowledged the complex, paradoxical nature of sustainability in fashion. ‚ÄúOn one side is the desire to renovate [existing clothes in women‚Äôs closets],‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAt the same time, [my job is to] create desire. We can find a balance that works. It‚Äôs very complex.‚Äù According to the show notes, ‚ÄúConceived as an 'inclusive garden,' [the collection] questions the place and role of living creatures on our planet. This is demonstrated by the scenography: a traveling grove designed with landscaping collective Coloco, the trees from which will continue their life journey after the show to enrich and preserve, like a pluralistic garden, the biodiversity of wooded spaces and other sustainability initiatives.\\" Ruth Bell opened the presentation of 89 looks, while Selena Forrest closed it. Roos van Elk, Qin Tian, Kukua Williams, Josephine Lynderup, Asya Ershova, Karlijin Kusters, Jordan Daniels, Blesnya Minher, Shuping Li, and Morgan Fernandez also walked the show. Angelababy, Bianca Brandolini, Erin O‚ÄôConnor, Isabelle Huppert, Jeanne Dumas, Jennifer Lawrence, Julianne Moore, Karlie Kloss, Laetitia Casta, Marisa Berenson, Monica Bellucci, and Natalia Vodianova were amongst the front row guests. As research for the Spring 2020 Collection, Chiuri visited with Marc Jeanson, botanist and Director of the Grand Herbier at the Museum of Natural History in Paris to cull their archive of more than 8,000,000 specimens. Marc Jeanson explained, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt describe plants out of living plants. We describe out of herbarium specimens. And so we would check the specimens that we brought back from the field, describe the species in the ost accurate way‚Ä¶ We keep every plant, from the babab tree to the smallest flowering plant in the world, that we call water lentils... When Chiuri asked what could be done to maintain the plant species, Jeanson explained the need for cataloguing as many species as possible before extinction, ‚ÄúIn order to preserve and to keep this biodiversity, we first need to identify it. Today, we really go into areas of the world where the wild plants are threatened and it‚Äôs very important for us to do that now, because the clock is ticking, you know, and we really need to go as fast as possible before it‚Äôs gone. Only 10-15% of the living world around us has been described. We need to describe so many more, because we depend on this living world to thrive and to maintain our species on the planet. And so it‚Äôs great to go on the moon; there‚Äôs a lot to do on Mars, but the first thing is to work on our little Earth, because most of the work needs to be done and it hasn‚Äôt been done yet.‚Äù Emanuele Coccia, Associate Professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, shared his views on the fundamental relationship between the Earth, the sun, and humankind in a discussion with Chiuri. ‚ÄúPlants have been a victim of our carelessness for thousands of years. We‚Äôre starting to recognize that they‚Äôre not just a nice background for our cities, or even our wild spaces... What is a garden? A garden is the cohabitation of different beings, according to a plan. The garden is the center of the identity of Christian Dior. The very first collection launched by Christian Dior in 1947 was inspired by plants. There is something that is specific to this House: its attentiveness throughout the years, to the life of plants. This makes it, I think, the one House that can, and that I would say must lead the way to fashion, becoming one of the laboratories where we can give more thought to the idea of tending to a cosmic and global garden.‚Äù References Dior Clothing brands of France Clothing companies of France Haute couture High fashion brands Luxury brands French brands ","title":"Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear runway collections"},{"id":"58489929","text":"Asocia»õia Clubul Sportiv T√¢rgu Secuiesc, () commonly known mainly after its Hungarian name as KSE T√¢rgu Secuiesc or simply KSE, is a Romanian women's basketball club based in T√¢rgu Secuiesc, currently participates in the Liga Na»õionalƒÉ, the top-tier league in Romania.Kayla Mobley va juca la ACS KSE T√¢rgu Secuiesc. totalbaschet.ro The club initially played in the second-tier Liga I.

Photograph by Jason Houston for USAID The community forestry program in Nepal is a government effort to reduce forest degradation and to promote sustainable forestry practices as well as to improve the livelihood of the community. It incorporates distinct policies, institutions and practices. The two main goals of the community forestry program is to empower local communities whilst encouraging environmental conservation benefits on the Himalayan forests. Nepal has become one of the first developing nations to adopt a community forestry management program which gives authority to the community and groups to manage forest resources. As a result, Nepal now stands as one of the leaders in community based forest management as they have made direct progress in halting environmental degradation and by regenerating forests in barren areas. Studies have proven the potential benefits that community forestry will have in combating environmental degradation as well as utilizing resources in a sufficient manner.  Governance  Prior to the community forestry program, the Government of Nepal had control of local forests during the mid 1950s. The community forestry project came into fruition during the late 1970s, when there was a great concern for environmental sustainability and the degrading Himalayan slopes. The continuing growing population put a strain on the resources and the government was seeking methods in order to protect their forests whilst achieving better livelihoods of the Nepali people. The government came to the conclusion that they needed active participation of local people in forest management in order to further reduce the environmental degradation in the Himalayan slopes. The first institutional shift began in 1978 when the forest regulation of Panchayat Forest and Panchayat-protected Forest Rules allowed local governments the right to oversee and manage selected forest areas. An even greater shift began in the early 1990s under the Forest Act 1993. This act enacted even greater government decentralisation and allowed local communities to have direct access and management over the forests that they depend on for resources. However, that is not to say that the government has not forfeited their ownership of the forests. The state still maintains ownership while communities have the rights to utilize and manage the forests. The Forest Act 1993 and Forest Regulation 1995 guaranteed two rights: 1) right to self-governance and 2) right to forest management and utilisation.  Effects  = People = November 2017. Kumrose, Nepal. Photograph by Jason Houston for USAID One of the two main goals under the community forestry program in Nepal was to alleviate poverty as well as improve the general livelihoods of the Nepali people. Various forms of discrimination on the basis of caste, economic status, ethnicity, gender, age and vulnerability exist in Nepal. This program's key objective was to increase the participation and empower the socially-marginalized peoples, allowing decision-making abilities within the community. Due to the program's overall success, one fourth of national forests in Nepal are under the community management where 1.6 million households are included as community forest user groups. There are over 19,000 community forest user groups. Within the community forestry user groups there are rich, medium and poor households that participate in the forest resource management. The contribution between the different socio-economic households and forest management is relatively equal. Resources within the forests such as fuelwood, timber, as well as fodder are used by the locals to generate income from sales. The program encouraged community development work that has had a direct effect on lower income households. Due to community development activities, they are able to generate daily incomes for the betterment of their livelihoods. However, there has been question regarding the incentives created to allow the involvement of socio- marginalized peoples within the community forestry program. Wealthy households have greater decision-making power when it comes to forest management and governance. This puts those who are of lower caste, women, and so on in a position of lower decision-making authority as well as participation within the program. Wealthier households have greater access to state administrators allowing them to dominate decision-making positions. Because they are able to set forest resource prices, this can reduce incentives for poorer households who cannot afford the high prices to participate. For the community forestry program to reach and maintain its goal of the improvement of the livelihoods of the Nepali people, creating incentives of disadvantaged groups is crucial to development. = Environment = October 2017. Kailas, Bajhang District, Nepal. Photograph by Jason Houston for USAID One of the main drivers for the implementation of the community forestry program in Nepal was to reduce the effects of environmental degradation and to improve the conditions of the Himalayan forests. According to one study, biodiversity in community forestry program plots was significantly higher than non-community forestry plots in forests in Terai. The overall effects of the community forestry program include the increase of biodiversity from the result of rejuvenating and expanding the diversity species of trees and plants. It is evident that the community's active participation on forest management had a positive effect on increasing biodiversity and forest coverage on the once barren slopes. Although there has not been comprehensive studies assessing the implementation of community forestry and improved forest conditions, it is evident through general observation and case studies that there has been indications of progress in overall forest conditions.

Originally published in 1962 by Per Bruun, the Bruun Rule was the first to give a relationship between sea level rise and shoreline recession. The rule is a simple, two dimensional mass conversion, and remains in common use to estimate shoreline recession in response to sea level rise, despite criticism and modification, and the availability more complex alternate models. The rule The Bruun Rule gives a linear relationship between sea level rise and shoreline recession based on equilibrium profile theory, which asserts that shore face profile maintains an equilibrium shape, and as sea level rises the increasing accommodation space forces this equilibrium profile landward and upward to preserve its shape relative to the new sea level. As such, the Bruun Rule analysis assumes that the upper beach is eroded as the shore profile moves landward, and that the volume of eroded material is deposited offshore, resulting in a rise of the nearshore bottom which maintains a constant water depth. The Bruun Rule predicts coastal recession to be as much as 10 to 50 times sea level rise, depending on the slope of the beach. Illustration of the Bruun Rule, by the Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (1991) The mathematical notation of the Bruun Rule is: R = frac{SL}{h+B} = frac{S}{tanbeta} Where, *R is shoreline recession, in metres *S is sea level rise, in metres *L is the horizontal length of the bottom affected by the sea level rise (from the dune peak to depth of closure), in metres *h is the depth of closure (the water depth beyond which significant sediment transport does not occur), in metres *B is the dune height above sea level, in metres *Œ≤ is the average slope of the active profile  History  In 1954, Per Moller Bruun published a paper describing beach profiles and cross shore equilibrium. Developing on these ideas, in 1962 he published his paper \\"Sea- Level Rise as a Cause of Shore Erosion\\", which first gave a relationship between sea level rise and the shoreline recession of equilibrium beach profiles. His rule wasn't given a name until 1967, when Schwartz published \\"The Bruun Theory of Sea-Level Rise as a Cause of Shore Erosion\\" which detailed laboratory and field tests of the theory and concluded that \\"the concept henceforth be known as \\"Bruun's Rule.\\"\\" Per Bruun has since published works to clarify the limitations and practicality of his model, including \\"Review of Conditions for Uses of the Bruun Rule of Erosion\\" in 1983, and \\"The Bruun Rule of Erosion by Sea-Level Rise: A Discussion on Large-Scale Two- and Three- Dimensional Usages\\" in 1988. These publications outline the rule's limitations and practicality and stress that, though this model is intentionally two dimensional, it is applied to three dimensional environments in practice. Bruun states that the rule \\"must be subjected to realistic adjustments\\" for practical use. As Bruun acknowledges, the Bruun Rule is a characteristically simple rule and has therefore been modified many times over, to account for more factors and in order to be accurately applicable in more cases. The Bruun Rule has been most often modified to account for longshore transport, overwash, and Aeolian sediment transport. For example, Dean and Maurmeier in 1983 modified the rule to be applicable to barrier shores and islands, some of which experience accretion instead of erosion. Rosati et al. in 2013 and Dean and Houston in 2016 have modified the rule to account for onshore transport, and cross shore movement over the supposed depth of closure. Further, Ashton et al. in 2011 modified the Bruun Rule for use on cliffed coasts, and Hinkel et al. in 2013 used the rule as part of a wider methodology to describe the effects on sea level rise on and around tidal inlets. The biggest challenge that remains seems to be isolating the effect of sea level rise on beach morphology from the coupled effects of wave energy, tidal currents, wind action, sediment supplies, sediment types and grain size, among others. In various forms and coupled with other models, the Bruun Rule has now been used to estimate shoreline responses to sea level rise worldwide. The Bruun Rule has been applied to coasts including of the Caspian Sea, Korean Peninsula, Shuidong Bay, Norfolk, Rhode Island, Florida, Accra, and Hawaii.  Criticisms  The effect of climate change on beaches is challenging to accurately model, as it is an interdisciplinary subject that involves ocean, earth, and atmospheric science as well as civil engineering and policy. Reliable coastal climate change impact assessments are needed to underpin effective strategies of adaptation in order to prepare growing coastal communities and high value coastal assets. As a result, models for estimating coastal erosion as a result of sea level rise - including the Bruun Rule and models based on the Bruun Rule - are constantly being reviewed and updated. The Bruun Rule has become the centre of much academic debate. In response to its inherent assumptions, the Bruun Rule has been widely criticised. Some of the rule's most criticised assumptions include the nonexistence of gradients in longshore sediment transport, the existence of a depth of closure, a closed sediment budget, and the availability of sufficient sand sources. In 2015, Andersen et al. labelled the Bruun Rule as \\" on its own...virtually unusable in open-ocean coastal environments\\" due to its assumptions of physical environmental setting. One prominently criticised assumption of the Bruun Rule is its postulation of the net effects of longshore transport as negligible, as the rule is by definition a two dimensional cross shore model that does not account for the longshore third dimension. These longshore effects can, however, be the major cause of sediment erosion or deposition along beaches, dominating shoreline morphology and even masking the impacts of sea level rise as described by the Bruun Model. Another criticised assumption is the existence of a 'depth of closure'. The depth of closure is considered to be the water depth beyond which there are no significant changes in bed level, and is usually taken as the boundary between the upper shoreface, characterised by breaking waves and bars, and the lower shoreface, characterised by nonbreaking waves and a lack of bars. The Bruun Rule stipulates that there is no significant sediment transfer across this boundary, however the strength of this concept in practice is debated. The alternative R-DA model, proposed by Davidson-Arnott, is based on the same assumptions as the Bruun Rule, except it recognises significant sediment transfer between the upper and lower shoreface, hypothesising that sediment is eroded from the lower shoreface and transported to the upper shoreface to maintain an equilibrium profile, and that as a result there is an upward and landward migration of the depth of closure with sea level rise. Cooper and Pilkey have been direct in their criticism of the Bruun Rule, publishing a paper in 2004 titled \\"Sea-level rise and shoreline retreat: time to abandon the Bruun Rule\\", which is regularly cited in ensuing literature. They argue that despite widespread criticism, the original Bruun Rule continues to be applied in inappropriate contexts, as outlined by Bruun and experimental history, and that the Bruun Rule and its accompanying controversial assumptions are embedded in later models claiming to offer more sophisticated insights into coastal behaviour. Cooper and Pilkey describe the use of the Bruun Rule as \\"a \\"one model fits all\\" approach\\" to a range of complex coastal environments for which it is unfit to describe. They list three main reasons that the rule \\"does not work\\": its restrictive assumptions, the omission of important variables, and its reliance on outdated and erroneous concepts. They describe the rule's restrictive assumptions as a closed materials balance, which ignores net longshore transport, and the lack of an accretionary component, that assumes sea level rise always results in beach recession, which together limit the rule's use to a small number of coasts. Cooper and Pilkey list the omitted variables as the presence of outcrops or bottom currents, the effect of continental shelf slope on retreat rate, site specific feedback relationships, and the highly variable patterns of coastal evolution at millennial time scales, and the outdated and erroneous concepts relied upon as a universal equilibrium profile theory, a closure depth, and that unsupported idea that shoreface steepness has an effect on the rate of shore retreat. They \\"conclude that [the Bruun Rule] has outlived its usefulness and should be abandoned\\", however they have been criticised for providing no \\"meaningful alternative\\" to the rule. In his papers, Bruun did not present a rigorous mathematical derivation for his rule, which has caused confusion in the research community. For example, Rosen in 1978, Allison and Schwartz in 1981, Dean and Maurmeyer in 1983, and Zhang, Douglas and Leatherman in 2004 have all mathematically derived the Bruun Rule differently, with disagreement on the assumptions and limitations of the Bruun Rule unique to their own derivations. However, the latter revision by Zhang et al. presents an alternative derivation showing that \\"even though very simple, the Bruun model has considerable generality\\". Some field and laboratory tests have supported the Bruun Rule, although claimed experimental flaws in these publications have been criticised.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Post office status was officially granted to Byron Bay in March 1888, while prior to this date Byron Bay was graded as a receiving office. In 1889 post and telegraph services, previously separate, were amalgamated. The railway from Lismore arrived in 1894, and provided a link between the river and sea ports to the expanding dairy industry. The region also prospered following the establishment of the Norco Butter Factory in the early twentieth century. The current (original component of) Byron Bay Post and Telegraph Office was constructed in 1896 at a cost of ¬£464 by local builders, Susannah Atkins, W John Hocquard and A F Wallis; after extensive delay it was opened in March 1897. A telephone exchange was opened in 1909 and Postmaster General Office records show that the building underwent considerable alteration in 1916, when a central gabled extension to the front and north wing were added. Extensive rear additions were constructed around 1997 to accommodate postal functions and the original building component at the front was leased for commercial use. The original building was designed by New South Wales Government Architect's Office (probably George Oakeshott) under Walter Vernon and later reworked by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways.  Description  Byron Bay Post Office is at 61 Jonson Street, Byron Bay, comprising the whole of Lot 1 DP736784. The Byron Bay Post Office is located on a large, essentially rectangular site located at the centre of Byron Bay's civic and administrative centre. The site originally extended from Jonson Street at the front through to Fletcher Street at the rear, however the construction of a telephone exchange at the rear of the site, and its eventual subdivision from the post office, terminated any relationship with Fletcher Street. While much of the townscape is modern commercial development, the post office has a visual link with the neighbouring former Institute building to the south and low scale retail shops to the north; the town's historic railway station and more recent visitor information centre is located directly opposite. The site comprises the 1896-1916 former post office building with landscaped setting occupying the western half, with the majority of the eastern half occupied by the 1997 post office building. Rear access to a narrow side yard space is provided by a lane from the north. The existing 1896-1916 frontal component features a single storey volume, essentially symmetrical in conception. Constructed on a cruciform plan the timber-framed weatherboard-clad structure is surmounted by a hipped corrugated Colorbond steel roof with frontal gable over the projecting central bay (the latter was added in 1916). The gable contains a louvred vent and the roofline is punctuated by original rendered brick chimneys with corbelled caps. The street elevation contains a tripartite window to the projecting bay with matching paired entrance doors in the south and north elevations of the bay, indicating the postal hall. The south bay is now blind to the street with an original tripartite window and non-original paired door in the south elevation. The north bay has been extended in a northerly direction into the original verandah area but retains an original panelled timber door and single window. The later construction is indicated by different weatherboard profile. The whole of the 1916 construction is screened by a timber-framed skillion verandah with exposed rafters, arched beams, square posts and non-original timber balustrade. The original south verandah has been extended in an easterly direction by two bays to meet the 1997 post office wing behind, and a disabled access ramp has been constructed along the southern side. The original timber verandah floor has been overlaid with an asphalted membrane with stamped mock brick pattern. The fa√ßade of the original building displays recent caf√© signage although the notice boards adjacent to the main entrance may be earlier. The original north elevation has been altered by the infill of the original verandah, though the verandah structure remains visible. The large rear additions are evidenced by the alternative weatherboard profile and face brick construction to the rear elevations. The roof span is much greater than the original, resulting in a higher hipped volume finished with Colorbond corrugated steel. In plan form, the former post office section has been substantially altered by the removal of most internal partition walls and the construction of the rear addition in 1997, removing all evidence of the former residential component. The original layout of the frontal component is only broadly discernable due to the remnant sections of wall and bulkheads. The key elements of the Byron Bay Post Office are its: * prominent frontal component * Federation characteristics * historic verandahed presentation to the street = Condition = Typologically, the original building combined a post and telegraph office and residence, altered to accommodate a telephone exchange in 1909 and enlarged and reworked in 1916. This was substantially altered and enlarged in 1997, relocating all postal functions from the original building and providing a separate retail tenancy area within the original post office. As such, the original building has been dramatically altered in plan form, fabric and presentation twice, although the 1916 alterations were significant in their own right. Internally, little or no evidence remains of the post office function and refurbishment work including suspended ceilings, wall linings and vinyl flooring has concealed original fabric and finishes. Architecturally and aesthetically, the exterior of the front (Jonson Street) component still presents a 1916 post office idiom, although this gradually degenerates towards the rear of the building and the extensive additions. The level of decorative detail has also been diminished with the replacement of original signage, roof sheeting and verandah fretwork and flooring. Externally and internally, the building appears to be in relatively sound condition, well maintained and with no major defects visible. The roof and subfloor spaces were not inspected and the installation of internal linings conceals the original structure and finishes. = Original fabric = * Structural frame: Timber-framed floor, walls and roof on brick piers * External walls: Chamfered profile, weatherboard cladding * Internal walls: Timber-framed and lined with lath and plaster or beaded timber lining boards [unknown]; 1919 alterations possibly relined the original with plaster sheet * Floor: Timber boarded with moulded timber skirting boards * Ceiling: Unknown, possibly beaded timber lining or lathe and plaster; 1919 alterations possibly relined the original with plaster sheet. * Roof: Hipped corrugated galvanised iron with gablet over main entrance, ogee profile gutters, cast iron roof decoration [?], rendered brick chimneys with moulded caps. Bull- nosed corrugated galvanised iron verandah roof with cast iron posts and frieze with pediment gable and finial over central entrance. * Other: Timber picket fence to frontage; timber-framed double-hung sash windows; panelled timber doors = Subsequent modifications = * 1909: Telephone exchange opened. * 1916-22: Substantial reworking of building to incorporate projecting gabled bay to front and hipped side wing to the north of the original; entrances provided from north and south verandah to new postal hall bay; replacement of original bull-nosed verandahs with straight timber verandahs with arched beams and fretwork balustrade; removal of front section of picket fence; internal refurbishment; construction of linesmen's shed; new letter boxes installed. * 1945: New lavatory block constructed, concrete paths, sundry repairs and repainting. Possibly involved the infill of the 1916 north wing verandah bay.  Heritage listing  Historically, Byron Bay Post Office, constructed in 1896 and enlarged in 1916, is significant for its demonstrated associations with the development of the township, including in the aftermath of the arrival of the railway from Lismore in 1894. The latter provided a link between the river and sea ports to the expanding dairy industry of the hinterland. While the post office originally combined a postal hall and telegraph office with a postmaster's residence in a domestically scaled and constructed \\"villa\\" form, this was later altered to include a telephone exchange. Other extensive alterations in 1916 reworked and enlarged the building to incorporate a larger public area, related to an increase in population closely tied to the growth of the town on the basis of the success of the Norco Butter Factory. The building is also significant for its position as part of the railway precinct group, in the cultural and administrative centre of the town (criterion a). Stylistically, Byron Bay Post Office is an amalgam of the late-Victorian villa idiom and a reworked Federation era homestead design with minor Queen Anne overtones. Federation themes are expressed through the building's scale, multiple roof form and timber expression, although much of the post office's characteristic period detail has been removed. The gabled and verandahed frontage remains a strong design component (criterion d). Aesthetically, Byron Bay Post Office is also prominently located within, and contributes to, the group of modest low-scale civic buildings and landscape elements in the town known as the so-called Railway Precinct group. The Federation period themes which remain evident and distinctive, as expressed through the building's scale, gabled roof form and timbered verandah, support this contribution. The post office is also one of several buildings in the town promoted on a tourism website, again emphasising its degree of local prominence (criterion e). The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Byron Bay Post Office include the main 1896-1916 former postal building (the front component) with landscaped setting occupying the western half; the built form on the majority of the eastern half of the building, occupied by the 1997 post office, is not significant. The separate telephone exchange to the east of the site, facing Fletcher Street, is not recommended for inclusion in the CHL. Byron Bay Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Constructed in 1896 and enlarged in 1916, Byron Bay Post Office is of historical significance for its demonstrated associations with the development of the township, including in the aftermath of the arrival of the railway from Lismore in 1894. The latter provided a link between the river and sea ports to the expanding dairy industry of the hinterland. While the post office originally combined a postal hall and telegraph office with a postmaster's residence in a domestically scaled and constructed \\"villa\\" form, this was later altered to include a telephone exchange. Other extensive alterations in 1916 reworked and enlarged the building to incorporate a larger public area, related to an increase in population closely tied to the growth of the town on the basis of the success of the Norco Butter Factory. The building is also significant for its position as part of the railway precinct group, in the cultural and administrative centre of the town. Criterion D: Characteristic values Byron Bay Post Office is an example of a: 1. Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929). 2. Building in the Federation-era domestic homestead style with minor Queen Anne overtones. 3. Building by New South Wales Government Architect's Office reworked by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways. Typologically, Byron Bay was designed as a combined post and telegraph office with a residence at the rear. Alterations in 1916 generally enlarged the postal component and introduced a clearly distinct frontal element to what previously appeared to be a completely amalgamated and integrated design. The visually distinct post office component was standard in small post office design of the later Federation period. While this aspect has been broadly retained externally, the key planning elements associated with the type, particularly the relationship between the main postal hall, the residence and telegraph function, has been substantially diminished particularly given the use of the original building as a caf√© and the relocation of all postal function to a new building at the rear. In plan form, the former post office section has also been substantially altered by the removal of most internal partition walls and the construction of the rear addition in 1997, removing all evidence of the former residential component. Stylistically, Byron Bay Post Office is an amalgam of the late-Victorian villa idiom and a reworked Federation era homestead design with minor Queen Anne overtones. Federation themes are expressed through the building's scale, multiple roof form and timber expression. Acknowledging this, much of Byron Bay's characteristic period detail has been removed or altered, particularly internally, where the building has been completely gutted and refurbished, although the gabled and verandahed frontage remains a strong design component. Architecturally, as it presents today, Byron Bay is an adaptation of a commonly applied Commonwealth style to a small regional institutional building. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Byron Bay Post Office is prominently located within the group of modest low-scale civic buildings and landscape elements of the so-called Railway Precinct group, which form the cultural, administrative and geographical centre of the town. Although alteration has occurred to the building, Federation period themes remain evident and distinctive, as expressed through the building's scale, gabled roof form and timbered verandah. The post office is also one of several buildings in the town promoted on a tourism website, again emphasising its degree of local prominence.

It was designed by James Barnet in 1885. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  In late 1872, a petition was made to the Postmaster General for the establishment of a weekly mail service between Bourke and the Cobar Mine. The service was established on 1 March 1873 with the first Postmaster being Charles Claxton, a storekeeper at the Cobar Mine, and the post office was run from the store owned by the mining company. Subsequent premises for the post office appear to have been those owned by the Postmaster at the time and included an inn (which was a source of some complaint), and various stores. By mid-1881 the Colonial Architect had been asked to design a new post and telegraph office, and the tender was let in July 1884. The new brick building opened on 15 August 1885.and was a post \\"office\\" only, without an associated residence, and comprised an office some 26ft wide and 24ft deep internally, and two lobby areas sited either side of a porch. The building was designed during James Barnet's term as New South Wales Government Architect. Early photographs show that the original structure comprised one large, high- ceilinged post-room with a gable roof running parallel to the street. On the front (east) fa√ßade, but not taking up its full width, was a central porch flanked on both sides by small rooms each used as a lobby in which a sloping writing board was provided for public use. The porch featured a rendered Italianate-styled arched entryway on its fa√ßade which can still be seen on the present building, but did not have a door at this face. A specification for the erection of additions and general repairs at the Cobar Post and Telegraph Office is dated 11 October 1907 and it appears that by 1909 the building had undergone the substantial alterations which brought it to its present general appearance. The original building (1885) was designed by the New South Wales Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet (1862-1890) with the alterations in 1892, 1899 and c.1907-1909 by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office under Walter Vernon (1891-1911).  Description  Cobar Post Office is at 47 Linsley Street, Cobar, comprising the whole of Lot 222 DP733322. The Cobar Post Office is sited on the west side of Linsley Street, one block south of Marshall Street and the main highway. The streetscape comprises a heterogeneous mix of residential, commercial, recreation and civic uses. The building is located directly to the south of the Cobar Council Chambers. A brown brick Telecom Exchange of more recent origin is located to the west of the post office building, and is not included in the heritage listing. The present Cobar Post Office comprises part of a single room Post Office constructed in 1885, a residence constructed in 1892, alterations to part of the front fa√ßade in 1899, and substantial extensions and alterations to the front facade and original postal room in c.1907-1909. The appearance of the Cobar Post Office, as seen from Linsley Street, is essentially as it was following the major alterations undertaken c.1907-09. The front (east) fa√ßade essentially presents as an asymmetrical parapeted single storey \\"screen\\" in front of a large gable roofed, double height structure, all constructed of red face brick. The rendered Italianate-styled arched entryway is located slightly left of centre and is surmounted by a squared \\"pediment\\" featuring an inset circular panel edged with egg and dart moulding and a deep convex-curved edge mould. The pediment is topped with a bowed cornice. Two flanking bays are slightly recessed back from this entrance section and feature tall timber framed windows, each with a plain lower light and a multi-paned upper light. To the left, or southern, end of this configuration, which dates from the 1899 alterations, is a dominant projecting section constructed in c.1907-09. It also features tall windows, although the window originally on the front elevation has been removed at some stage and the opening bricked in. In the matching position towards the right or northern end of the main fa√ßade is another windowed bay, which also dates from the 1899 alterations and is set slightly forward of the adjacent bays. The final bay at the north end comprises an open porch housing private post boxes with a large open arch on the front fa√ßade and a window, which matches those from the 1899 alterations, in the north facade. The somewhat disparate elements of the facade are tied together through the use of a full length, solid parapet with cornice mouldings and a deeply moulded string course, all which returned down the sides of this front \\"screen\\". The flat arched heads to the windows are also joined by a single moulded string course which runs across the fa√ßade and returns down the sides. At sill level a flat mould (of the same height as the painted, dressed stone sills) similarly joins these elements across the fa√ßade. At the base is a rendered and painted plinth. Single letters of metal spell out COBAR 2835 above the arched entry, and the words POST and OFFICE are located in the flanking bays above the windows. The main postal room behind is a double-height rectangular structure with a gable roof, clad in short sheets of corrugated galvanised iron, running parallel to the street. The two long facades are blank and partly screened by the front and rear sections of the remainder of the building. The shorter south fa√ßade features three square highlight windows below which are another three openings, one door on the westernmost side and two windows. The north fa√ßade features two square highlight windows, while the lower half is fronted by a skillion roofed verandah which was lined out at some later date to form a storage room and an additional porch for private post boxes. Each end of the gable roof is edged with timber bargeboards, originally rounded at the ends but now squared off, which are bound together at the apex with a ridge post and transverse joist. The original decorative frieze infills are no longer in place. A carved decorative bracket is also sited at each end of the transverse joist and at the end of each of the bargeboards. There is a rendered and painted chimney with a decorative corbelled head projecting through the ridge at the north end of the gable roof. The Postmaster's residence at the rear is essentially rectangular in form and projects back into the site perpendicular to the postal room. The pitched roof is clad with short sheets of corrugated galvanised iron and intersects into the rear plane of the gable roof to the postal room. At the other end, the roof finishes with a hip, the west plane of which continues to form a skillion roof over the end section. There a number of rendered and painted chimneys with decorative corbelled heads projecting through the roof. A skillion roofed verandah runs alongside the long north fa√ßade and returns along the adjacent west fa√ßade of the postal room. The timber posts are stop chamfered and original lace brackets are no longer in place. Part of the verandah adjacent to the residence is enclosed to form a \\"sleep-out\\" partially lined with flywire inserted between the timber studs of the frame. The external brick wall to this area has been painted; the rest of the walling is red face brick. The original locations of small rosette vents (as seen in c.1892 photographs but since removed and the openings plastered over) can be seen along the exposed wall surface above the junction of the verandah and the main wall of the residence, and are also located in the same high location on the south fa√ßade as well as in the lower part of the wall on both of these facades. Windows are generally timber framed and double hung with two panes per sash; those to the east side of the entrance door on the north fa√ßade have been opened up to ground level. The window sills are painted dressed stone. On the south fa√ßade a recessed section of the residence directly adjacent to the postal room has been infilled at a later date with a skillion roofed area lined with fibre-cement sheet and glazing. Internally the postal room is very plain, the only decorative detailing being timber arch brackets to the edges of the squared openings between the front section and the postal room. The ceiling consists of sheet panels with strapping to the joints and may be more recent than the c.1907-09 alterations. The fireplaces have been closed off but one still features a simple timber mantelpiece with decorative support brackets. The doorway between the postal room and the residence has a deep reveal and a decorative architrave. The timber panelled door features a decorative metal door handle and has a hopper opening fanlight over. The lunch room, storage and office area has timber framed walling lined with cement sheets with strapping over the joints, all of which appear to be of a later date than the comprehensive c.1907-09 alterations. Introduced partitions to about 2400mm height divide the retail area from the mail room but do not obscure an understanding of the volume of the overall space. At an unknown date, but after a photograph of the building was taken in 1946, the verandah area alongside the main post-room was lined out internally and externally to form a long, narrow storage area, and an open porch area with a brick entry, the latter adjacent to the main fa√ßade. In possibly the 1970s, and maybe earlier, the space between the post office and the municipal offices was infilled with a brown brick structure incorporating a ramp. As with Northam and a few other remaining post offices, Cobar has a quarters component which is currently let as a rental property. The residence was not able to be viewed on the date of the inspection. = Key elements = * overall building form, including details of face brickwork, rendered decorative mouldings, dressed stone sills, and roof forms and chimneys * free-standing form and relationship to surrounding streetscape and the adjacent Council Chambers = Condition = The building is in good condition but has undergone extensive changes to its form and appearance.

The latter works, from 1892 through to c.1907-1909 were under the aegis of architect Walter Vernon, and responded to the ongoing and evolving needs of the town in regard to postal and telecommunication services. The works included the addition of a substantial residence in 1892. The original postal service in the town dates back to 1873, with the establishment of a weekly mail service between Bourke and the Cobar Mine. The post office's relationship to the historic Cobar Municipal Council Chambers to the north, enhances this aspect of significance (criterion a). Aesthetically, Cobar Post Office, although an altered and evolved building has a strong visual presence in its streetscape context, enhanced by the unpainted face brick exterior and contrasting white rendered bands, decorative mouldings, dressed stone sills, and detailing. The aesthetic value and presentation of the building also derives from the impact of the asymmetrical parapeted single storey \\"screen\\" in front of the large gable roofed, double height structure, and the rendered Italianate-styled arched entryway with pediment above. This value is also enhanced by the complementary relationship with the adjoining Council Chambers, with the two buildings sharing similar materials, scale and proportion as seen from the main street frontages. The post office is additionally identified as one of several \\"local landmarks\\" in a local tourism/visitor brochure (criterion e). The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Cobar Post Office include the main postal building comprising fabric dating from 1885 through to c.1907-1909, with the main fa√ßade to Linsley Street dating from the latter works. The residence to the rear constructed in 1892 is also significant; the site also retains mature vegetation to the rear yard, which contributes to the setting of the property. Non-significant elements include the brown brick infill structure between the post office and the municipal offices. The brown brick Telecom Exchange of more recent origin, located to the west of the post office building, is not included in the heritage listing. Cobar Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Cobar Post Office has been an important local postal building for over 120 years, being built in 1885 to a design by the New South Wales Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet, and subsequently altered and extended during successive phases.

The method is based on the important and decisive discovery that these compounds are able to react with formaldehyde ‚Äì in near complete absence of water ‚Äì to form fluorophores, i.e. molecules that, when irradiated with light invisible to the eye, will emit visible light. This happens in a ‚Äúdry‚Äù state, without extracting the monoamines from the cells during the entire procedure, a process that starts with separation of a tissue sample and ends with a thin tissue slice that can be examined in a fluorescence microscope. The F-H method allowed, for the first time, the examiner to watch these monoamines light up in the microscope and to precisely determine in which cells they were present, and thereby understanding their functions. The method was developed by Bengt Falck and Nils-√Öke Hillarp in the 1960s at the Department of Histology, University of Lund. For intense neurobiological research it became possible to demonstrate the presence of monoamines in nerve cells belonging to the central and the peripheral nervous system and for the first time comprehend that these substances act as signal substances, i.e. transmitters. The initial publication, written already in 1961, described a wide-ranging examination of nerves supplying a large number of organs in the body. This work validated the concept of Ulf von Euler, the Nobel prize winner, that noradrenaline is the signal substance in peripheral autonomic nerves. In the same year, this first publication was followed by an explanation of the chemical background of the F‚ÄìH method. Very thin membranes, such as the rat iris or mesentery, do not have to be sectioned for microscopic studies but may simply be spread on glass, dried, and then exposed to gaseous formaldehyde for subsequent study with a fluorescence microscope. The publication on the chemical background was later named among \\"The 200 Most- Cited Papers of All Time\\". In 2012, the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Lund arranged a symposium ‚ÄúFrom Nerve to Pills‚Äù celebrating the 50th anniversary of the initial publication of the F-H method.

It is located along the Colombo-Kandy A1 highway. It is a common roadside stop for tourists to enjoy the vistas to the Kegalle valley below and view the prominent inselberg known as the Bible Rock. Geography A view from Kaduganna Pass Kadugannawa Pass is situated at the boundaries of the Central and Sabaragamuwa Provinces in Sri Lanka. The pass lies along the Alagalla mountain range and is surrounded by Ambuluwawa, Knuckles and Hanthana Mountain Ranges on its eastern side. To the west is a precipice with vistas over the Kegalle valley of the river Maha Oya with prominent inselbergs Bible Rock (Bathalegala) and Devanagala. Kadugannawa Pass incline begins at 290 feet above sea level passing the Higula near Mawanella by road or Rambukkana station by train. The road and rail tracks winds up through rugged terrain and reaches its peak near Kadugannawa Dawson Tower at 1690 feet above sea level. History The Kadugannawa Pass was a lookout point in the Kingdom of Kandy. The Balana fort which was the main fortress established to protect the Kandian Kingdom from foreign powers was situated near the Kadugannawa pass.Kadugannawa Tunnel rock piercing. The British were the first foreign power to occupy Kingdom of Kandy permanently. British Governor Edward Barnes wanted a new road built to Kandy as the old road was long and circuitous. The old road was along the Kelani river valley, via Ruwanwella to the Ma Oya valley, then up the incline to Gampola and on to Kandy. The new road was built through Kadugannawa mountain pass in the 1820s led by Captain Dawson. When British built the new Colombo-Kandy road they decided to pierce a rock at the Kadugannawa Pass instead of blasting it away or simply bypassing it, as the new road does today. This rock piercing is known as the Kadugannawa Tunnel and is still preserved though a bypass road was built around it when the Colombo-Kandy A1 highway was widened and upgraded in the late 1980s. An explanation for piercing the rock is that the Kadugannawa tunnel was a symbol. The tunnel is said to have been created to fulfill an old Sinhalese prophecy that there is no way to foreigners to rule Kandy, unless they pierce the mountains. The British were the first foreign power to occupy Kandy permanently. Thus, the British went out of their way to include a tunnel on the road. Regrettably, this nice story is disputed, as the Kurunegala tunnel is claimed to have been constructed earlier (in 1823) to fulfill the prophetic saying. alt= Kadugannawa Ambalama is a historic wayside rest built a few metres below the Kadugannawa tunnel.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 08 November 2011.  History  The Muswellbrook Post Office was erected in two stages. The first section (to the rear of the site) was constructed as a post or telegraph office in 1861, possibly by Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson. The second portion of the building was designed by Dawson's successor as Colonial Architect, James Barnet, and erected in 1885.Muswellbrook Heritage Study Inventory The building contained both a post and a telegraph office by 1878. The telegraph office continued for a time in the 1861 building after the present post office in front of it was completed. The 1880s works also included upstairs quarters.  Description  Muswellbrook Post Office is at 7 Bridge Street, Muswellbrook, comprising the whole of Lot 17 DP758740. Muswellbrook had both a post and a telegraph office by 1878. This appears to have been in an 1861 building at the rear of the present post office building fronting Bridge Street, which was constructed in 1883-5. The whole 1861-1885 fabric is taken as being the original complex for purposes of this survey. The telegraph office continued for a time in the 1861 building after the present post office in front of it was completed. The combined buildings have three distinct components. Maisy Stapleton's 1981 roof plan, included with the original submission for the Register of the National Estate, shows the current post office as an oblong mass fronting Bridge Street with a return verandah to the west and south. Behind that are two more blocks, listed as \\"rendered outbuildings\\" and linked by covered walkways. These appear to be the 1861-1878 fabric. Details of construction and form largely relate to the 1883-5 component. This was two storied, possibly with a stucco rendered exterior (resprayed in 1968 with a sprayed concrete finish). The roof is hipped, evidently timber-framed, and is clad with corrugated colorbond, and supported on a broad eave with planking soffits. One chimney is visible from the street: it has a cornice and the stack has a sprayed concrete finish with the high points screed off. The chimney has four terracotta pots. The original roof is a double-hip form, which drains to a rainhead under the rear eaves. Fabric indicates that another rainhead may have been removed, and its downpipe connected to the upper gutter. The post office at Scone still uses this method of disposal of rainwater from box gutters. The verandah roof is shed- framed and clad in corrugated colorbond, supported on a set of octagonal, tapered posts. There is a verandah frieze in a floral pattern which resembles cast iron lace but is actually in fretted timber. The verandah also has an Italianate railing with waisted balusters in cast iron. The verandah base is coursed and rendered. The floor has modern, non slip tiles, over concrete. There is a flagpole fitted to one of the verandah posts. The walls have a sprayed concrete finish and there are wide bracketed sills to the windows. The simple rendered arches have been overcoated. The windows are double hung, with scotia horns and a light arch effect in the top rail of the upper sash. Fenestration is in a broadly symmetrical pattern, apart from a single window on the ground floor. These windows all have segmental heads with prominent drip mouldings on both floors, and bracketed sills. The frames are double-hung sashes with single panes. On the first floor the three central windows facing Bridge Street are clustered in a trio, and this is matched on the ground floor by a central set of windows, of similar width to the upstairs window trio. Entry is by two sets of steps at each end of the verandah, and by a pedestrian ramp on the north side. The pattern of two flanking windows on the Bridge Street frontage at the first floor is matched by corresponding window placement on the south end of the ground floor. But a door and window to the north side are relocated off symmetry. Window placement to the south elevation is regular, though the south side extension simply continues the first floor course line as a parapet, and encompasses two small parcel room windows at its rear. The encircling verandah gives the two-storey design a \\"through-the-roof\\" appearance. Various unspecified repairs were made in 1890 and 1895. A car port-garage was added at the rear of the 1861-78 blocks. It has the appearance of 1950s construction, with a stud frame and rusticated weatherboards. The store room for bikes has a concrete floor and a roller shutter. The principal alterations, though, appear to have been in reassigning spaces in the former post office buildings of 1861-78. These currently house two storerooms, a lunch room, a postmen's area, a contractors' room, male toilets and locker room, cleaner's room, foyer, two verandahs and a bike shed. The upstairs quarters of 1883-5 have been refitted to provide a lunch room, a postal manager's office, cleaner's room, tea room and store, though the valuation report still lists this area as 'an old manager's residence including two bedrooms, a study, bathroom and kitchen, and also lists executive-style office suites as being in the building.Savills, p. 2 There is no upstairs bathroom. In the 1980s the ground floor of the 1883-5 block became a long transverse retail space and after 2004, two counters were formed with joinery and partitions. The entry doors are to each end, and the main retail entry door has been replaced with a reproduction, four-panel timber / glass door. The main chamber has a retailing \\"overlay\\" which retains large openings at each end, under raked ceilings. They have fluted reveals, and chamfered, square dressed architraves. All ceilings are plasterboard with scotia cornices. A fireplace is concealed by the display. There are two counters, one formed by joinery, and the other framed by a large opening to the rear wall. The square heads of the windows are visible at the sides. Architraves are an ogee pattern and all joinery is painted. The flooring is carpet over timber. Behind the main chamber is a corridor. It leads to a storeroom with a lower floor level and a concrete step. It was originally an open verandah facing the south driveway, and has remnant external wall finishes. The room has two modern fixed glass windows, and a plasterboard ceiling with scotia cornice. The flooring is carpet over concrete. There is also a unisex toilet. Behind the second counter, is an area with a lower floor, plasterboard ceiling, carpet floor and a door, which leads to the rear post box filling room. The large rear room provides access to a mail sorting room for filling the front suite of postal boxes. The ceiling is raked, and is lined with plasterboard and a scotia cornice. The flooring is carpet. The larger room has similar finishes, and with rendered walls, carpet floor and vinyl skirting. There is a flush panel door to the central rear office. It has a threshold under the carpet, indicating that it was once an external wall of the larger rear pavilion. A rubber-floored ramp leads to the east, to the rear pavilion, which contains a large sorting room. It has a carpet on timber floor, vinyl skirting, and a plasterboard ceiling and scotia cornice. Walls are rendered and there is a flush panel exit door. The rear office is one of two rooms contained within the smaller pavilion. A fireplace is partly obscured some of its tiling is evident. The other room is a staff room. The fireplace is sealed and the chimney breast has chamfered corners. The contractors' room has door which leads to the \\"truckport\\" outside. The room has a vinyl floor on concrete, which is probably contributing to the deterioration of the stone plinth. The concrete floor is at a lower level than the main sorting room, and is reached via a short ramp. Walls are rendered, and the sheet ceiling has half-round cover strips. The room leads to a small sorting room, located in a former verandah which has been enclosed. The original outer wall is ashlar scored. The stairwell retains the original timber stair (painted) with vinyl covered, tapered treads. Balusters and newel posts are turned, and the stringers are plain. All doors are four panel, with inlaid mouldings, pivoted transoms and ogee architraves. Two double hung windows have no glazing bars. The staff (lunch) room has double hung timber framed windows to both the front and south elevations. There is a distinctive cast iron fireplace with an elaborately carved timber surround. The ceiling is strapped, and has a timber scotia cornice. There is a vinyl floor and skirting, covering the painted ogee skirting. The rear office is similar to the staff room and has a similar fire surround, but fitted with a less decorative fire insert. A small room off the landing has similar finishes and timber shelves installed. Returning to the ground floor, the mail room spaces are located to the north side of the building and partway along the rear, around an inset general office, strong room, male toilet, stair and parcel room. The PO boxes were relocated along the entire north side of the front building, with a cranked walkway under a stepped awning roof. The postal boxes are fitted into timber framed walls sitting on modern raked brick which has been painted. Above the boxes are fixed windows. The verandah has a raked, sheeted ceiling with extruded jointing strips. The verandah roof is supported with tubular steel posts, and extends in a single plane to the upper floor wall above. A steel-framed covered way leads to the demountable building further back along the north side. Opposite the demountable are the two pavilions, joined with a matching \\"infill\\" wall, which has been ashlar scored to match the finish of the pavilions. These walls retain their unpainted finish and the larger of the two pavilions is sited atop a coursed sandstone plinth. At the south east corner of the site is large \\"truckport\\" serving the contractors' room and access to the staff facilities. It partly covers overlaps the roofs of the two early pavilions, which have hipped roofs of corrugated steel. There is a battery charging room off a rear access door. At the rear, a concreted plant area was set out at the south east corner of the 1883-5 block. Washing facilities are at the rear of the 1861-78 blocks, housed in the weatherboard skillion and the back yard has been concreted. The driveway is brick paved. = Condition = The building is in good condition despite the changes in use and the building's age. Some cracking has occurred, and there is evidence of salt damp to the sandstone plinth and on north walls. Effects of rising damp are evident in other areas. The main building is linked by a ramped access to a second pavilion. The link between the two is roofed in skillion forms. A further pavilion at the rear is connected by a skillion roof and matching infill rendered wall. Verandahs have been added or absorbed within later development. A weatherboard \\"lean to\\" is added at the rear. There is a weatherboard garage building, and a \\"Terrapin\\" demountable building with a covered link to the west side of the main building.  Heritage listing  Muswellbrook Post Office, constructed in two stages in 1861 and 1885, comprises two buildings: a smaller structure to the rear of the site (1861), and a two-storey 1880s building facing Bridge Street. It is a rare example of the survival of two postal buildings on one site, both more than a century old, and designed and built for the same purpose, but of different generations and styles. The significant components of Muswellbrook Post Office include the main 1861-1885 post office complex. Muswellbrook Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 08 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Muswellbrook Post Office comprises two buildings: a smaller structure to the rear of the site (1861), and a two- storey 1880s building facing Bridge Street. It is a rare example of the survival of two postal buildings on one site, both more than a century old, and designed and built for the same purpose, but of different generations and styles. The buildings have the potential to contribute to an understanding of two different stages of the development of postal operations in regional NSW. The significant components of Muswellbrook Post Office include the main 1861-1885 post office complex. Criterion D: Characteristic values Muswellbrook Post Office is an example of: * A first generation typology Post Office (1803-1869), with a later larger Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * Residential/domestic-style Victorian design by Alexander Dawson (1861) and James Barnet (1885) Muswellbrook Post Office combines characteristics of the first (1803-1869) and second (1870-1929) typologies. The building is largely intact to its various phases of construction. While aspects of the original planning and detail have been impacted by changes of use, works and additions and a sprayed concrete finish to the exterior walls, the building is still visibly a Victorian-era civic building with the principal post office components. Architecturally and stylistically, the building's distinctive domestic character is unusual in both its mid-late Victorian period of construction, and in the work of James Barnet. It is possible that the aesthetic of the earlier building informed the form and detailing of the later building. In other circumstances, a different character might have been expected for a prominent civic building in a by-then prospering and established regional centre. The timber verandah is a rare surviving example from the late Victorian period. It is also evidence of Barnet's distaste for cast iron ornament. The buildings are also distinguished by a domestic character and \\"Old Colonial\\" simplicity. Criterion G: Social value Socially the two buildings have local significance to the Muswellbrook community for being components of the commercial hub of the town over a sustained period.

It was built from 1894 to 1930. It is also known as Colebrook Memorial Aboriginal Evangelical Church. The property is owned by La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013.  History  La Perouse is situated south of the Sydney central business district on the northern headland of Botany Bay. Named for a French navigator who stayed in the area for just six weeks in 1788, La Perouse is the only Sydney suburb where Aboriginal people have held on to their territory from settlement until the present day. Its history is a story of the survival of the Aboriginal culture in the face of European invasion. It is also the story of a suburb where Aboriginal people and Europeans from a wide variety of backgrounds co- existed and established relationships on their own terms in the mid 20th century outside the prevailing government programs of separation and assimilation. =Indigenous history= The original owners of the land were the Kameygal, and their proximity to the coast meant that they enjoyed a plentiful supply of fish. The area also had fresh water supplies and places of natural shelter. The Kameygal travelled with the seasons, and established relationships with other Aboriginal people along the New South Wales South Coast. La Perouse, or Gooriwal, as it was known prior to the arrival of Europeans, was described by European observers as an expanse of low heath full of bird life, which in turn abutted a tidal shore brimming with shellfish. Kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and echidnas were prevalent, as were fish, which formed the staple of the local Muru-ora-dial clan. The Muru-ora-dial people lived a subsistence lifestyle and probably spoke the Dharawal language. It is unclear how long the Muru-ora-dial clan lived in the La Perouse area. Aboriginal people, however, are known to have lived on the shores of Botany Bay and Port Jackson for several thousand years. Today, many residents at La Perouse have strong connections with the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay on the NSW South Coast. La Perouse is the one area of Sydney with which Aboriginal people have had an unbroken connection for over 7,500 years. Members of the Timbery family living in La Perouse today can trace their ancestors back to pre-contact times. =Colonial settlement and occupation= Botany Bay was first explored by explored by Europeans in 1770 when first contact made with the Aboriginal people of the La Perouse region by Captain James Cook and the crew of HMS Endeavour. From 18‚Äì21 January 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet anchored in Botany Bay but found it unsuitable for settlement because of swampy land and a lack of fresh water. On departing Botany Bay for Sydney Cove Phillip sighted the French scientific expedition ships L'Astrolabe and La Boussole commanded by Comte de Laperouse entering the bay. Laperouse landed on Frenchman's Beach and remained for six weeks. Father Receveur, a Franciscan chaplain died of injuries received at Samoa during this period and is buried at La Perouse. Laperouse departed on 10 March 1788 and the expedition was later wrecked off the Solomon Islands. 1n 1789 a smallpox outbreak devastated the Aboriginal people of the Sydney region. The \\"blacks\\" hospital' was set up at Little Bay to isolate the sick and dying with provisions of fish and water. Governor Macquarie closed the northern headland of Botany Bay to settlement in 1812, believing the land around Botany Bay to be barren and unfertile. The colonial government, however, still established its presence at La Perouse in built structures of command and control. A watchtower built in 1822 on the highest point of the headland at La Perouse had troops stationed to keep watch for smugglers. From 1833 to 1903 it took on the role of a customs house and was also used in the 1860s as a school. In 1869 La Perouse was connected to the city by road. The first submarine telegraph cable between Australia and New Zealand was laid in 1876 with the cable coming ashore at Frenchman's Beach.This was moved to Bondi Beach in 1917 Telecommunications commenced on 21 February 1876 (in wooden huts) until the La Perouse Cable Station, designed by the Colonial Architect James Barnett was completed in 1882 and used for telecommunications, training and accommodation until 1917. The Cable Station was used as an extension of the Coast Hospital during the Spanish influenza epidemic (1918‚Äì20); for nurses' accommodation for the Coast Hospital (1920‚Äì33) and as a Salvation Army refuge for women and children (1944‚Äì87). In 1988 it was reopened as the La Perouse Museum and Aboriginal Cultural Centre. In 1903 the telegraph service was transferred to nearby Yarra Bay House which was later (1928) Training School for girls. In the 1980s Yarra Bay House became the offices for the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council. The colonial government established a permanent hospital at Little Bay in 1885 to treat patients with infectious diseases such as smallpox and typhoid. =Indigenous presence at La Perouse, 1870s to 1930s= The 1870s marked a change in the nature of the Aboriginal community at La Perouse. Many Aboriginal people who had been forced off their lands on the South Coast by dairy farming moved to Sydney to seek employment or government rations. Informal refuges developed at La Perouse and Blacktown. La Perouse was known to government officials as the \\"blacks camp\\". In the early 1880s, the colonial government was under increasing pressure to take action on Aboriginal affairs. In 1882 Sir Henry Parkes appointed George Thornton as Protector of Aborigines. Thornton believed that Aboriginal people should be removed from urban locations. Yet he did honour the request of five Aboriginal men and their families to be allowed to stay at La Perouse. He justified his decision to Parliament by arguing that the camp was economically viable, in contrast with other camps in Sydney which were seen as parasitic and a nuisance to society. Thornton organised for huts to be built for people camped at La Perouse. By 1881 there were approximately 50 Aboriginal people living in two camps in the Botany Bay region: 35 at La Perouse and the remainder at Botany Bay. Residents were free to travel between the camps. In 1883 Thornton's position was replaced by the Aborigines Protection Board (APB), which followed a more isolationist and protectionist policy. The Board established Aboriginal reserves, which effectively segregated Aboriginal people from white Australians throughout New South Wales. In 1885 a small Anglican mission was established at La Perouse. The mission provided religious instruction, food, shelter and basic education. A church was built on Frenchman's Beach in 1894. In 1894, the mission was included in the annual report of the New South Wales Aborigines Protection Association. In 1895 seven acres (2.4 hectares) of land at La Perouse were gazetted by the NSW Government as a \\"Reserve for the Use of Aborigines\\"‚Äîthe only one in Sydney. The APB's decision was partly prompted by the desire of the local Aboriginal people to protect their homes and lifestyle from the encroachment of commercialism and missionaries. The APB managed the reserve. In the first decades the reserve was run by the resident missionary with a policeman. In later decades (and certainly by the 1940s) there was a resident manager (often a retired soldier or former gaol warden) whose wife would act as the matron. With the introduction of the reserve manager, the resident missionary retained responsibility only for the church and its missionary activities to the community. The manager lived down the hill from the church, separate to the resident missionary. Managers and missionaries worked separately on the reserve. While the reserve managers were generally disliked, the La Perouse Aboriginal community \\"loved\\" the resident missionaries (Friends of La Perouse: 2012, pers. comm.). The Aboriginal population was segregated from the Europeans on the reserve to \\"protect\\" them from the white community. They received rations only and no other benefits, which tied them to the reserve. In 1895 the reserve was enclosed by a fence and only the local constable and the resident missionary had a key. Aboriginal people on the reserve were literally locked in. A boom gate was built at the entrance to the reserve which survived into the 1950s. As late as the 1940s, permission was needed from the reserve manager for an Aboriginal person to enter or leave the reserve. The manager had the right of eviction and entry to all homes on the reserve. In 1918 the APB was granted power to remove Aboriginal children under 18 from the reserves without parental consent if the Board considered removal was in the child's best interestsLa Perouse: 5, 7, 15 The Board provided fishing nets to facilitate self-sufficiency on the reserve, but due to fishing being seasonal around La Perouse many people still travelled to their traditional lands around the Illawarra and South Coast. When the Department of Fisheries introduced a licensing system in New South Wales, Aboriginal people were prevented from selling fish at the markets. They were only able to fish for personal consumption, and even this was restricted by the actions of local fishermen. The APB was also concerned that Aboriginal people from outside Sydney would travel to La Perouse and from there gain access to the city. Restrictions were therefore placed on Aboriginal people at La Perouse travelling by rail or boat to Sydney. After 1886 when the Hampden Road \\"valley\\" area of Paddington was promoted for \\"industrial purposes\\" and population there increased along with pressure for more housing. Aboriginals in the valley and Rushcutters Bay had been transferred to La Perouse by the time of later land sales (1898, 1903).Johnson, 2012 By 1897, the APB had decided that the La Perouse reserve was no longer suitable for Aboriginal occupation. Both the NSW Department of Lands and the missionaries on the reserve disagreed with the APB's decision. They argued that it would be difficult to move the Aboriginal people because of their long history of occupation of the area. In 1897 the APB rejected requests from missionaries for more huts and increased rations because it was thought that this would encourage more people to move from the South Coast to La Perouse. Nevertheless, by 1900, the APB had decided that it would relocate the Aboriginal people from La Perouse reserve to Wallaga Lake on the South Coast. The La Perouse residents refused to move, however, even though the APB reduced, and eventually ceased supplying, their rations. By 1902, it seems that the APB had given up its relocation plans and resumed supplying rations to those on the reserve. In 1908 there were 73 people living on the reserve and new houses were built. By 1912, the reserve's population had grown to 106, and to 124 by 1915. The APB disliked, but was unable to stop, the increase in the number of non-Aboriginal Australians making day trips to La Perouse following the opening of the tram line from central Sydney to La Perouse in 1910. The La Perouse Aboriginal people participated in the tourist industry, selling boomerangs and other souvenirs, including the famed shellwork produced by the Aboriginal women. From the 1920s until the 1960s, Aboriginal artists and snake show demonstrations were popular, in a pit near the Loop (where the tram line terminated). Beryl Beller remembered collecting shells with her mother to glue onto various cardboard cut-outs and sell to tourists. Lee-Anne Mason recalled waiting in anticipation for the weekend tourists to arrive. People would \\"be flocking in all day\\" to watch Mr Cann, the snake man. She also recalled diving for pennies and how she would always manage to catch the penny before it hit the sand. The La Perouse community also engaged with tourists over the 1932 celebrations for opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Members of the community walked across the bridge in kangaroo skins at its opening. The event is commemorated in La Perouse with the two engravings on the sandstone outcrop just south of the church.pers. comm. 19/5/2012, Friends of La PerouseDEC Aboriginal site card 45-6-873 After World War II the tourists included migrants from Mediterranean Europe who felt an affinity with the La Perouse beach and landscape. Moving the Aboriginal people from La Perouse re- emerged as an issue during the 1920s when Randwick Council responded to pressure from the South Kensington and District Chamber of Commerce which wrote to the APB expressing concerns about the reserve's housing conditions, sanitation and \\"morality\\". The APB agreed that the reserve should be moved. But again, the people on the reserve refused to move. In 1928, a petition signed by 53 reserve residents was published in The Sydney Morning Herald. It read: :'We, the undersigned aborigines of the La Perouse reserve, emphatically protest against our removal to any place. This is our heritage bestowed upon us: in these circumstances we feel justified in refusing to leave'. As a compromise measure, Randwick Council in 1931 converted the foreshore section of the original reserve into a park and public recreation area, and moved the huts away from the waterfront. =Depression camps at La Perouse, 1930s to 1960s= From the start of the Depression in 1929 hundreds of unemployed people moved to La Perouse to camp close to the beaches with access to fresh water, natural shelter and the ocean. Three separate camps for the unemployed were set up at La Perouse. They were Hill 60, Frog Hollow and Happy Valley. Simple huts were erected of corrugated iron roofing, white-washed hessian walls and earth floors. Food was scrounged from the local fishermen and Chinese market gardeners. The government provided one pint of milk per family per day. Happy Valley was the largest of the camps, with a stable population of over 300. It was located opposite the Aboriginal mission, next to Anzac Parade, in a gully behind Congwong Beach. Frog Hollow was an Aboriginal camp, also near the reserve. Many who set up camp at Frog Hollow were relatives of Aboriginal people living on the reserve. The communities of these two camps enjoyed a good relationship and much interaction with the Aboriginal people on the reserve. Aboriginal-European relationships resulted in many marriages and children. Non-Aboriginal partners, however, were not allowed to live on the reserve. The camps offered a measure of freedom that was not found on Aboriginal reserves. White and black children attended the same school, which was unusual at a time when government policy aimed to separate Indigenous and European Australians. Children didn't focus on the differences between them. One woman recalled that when someone raised the alarm that 'the welfare's coming' (meaning that the child welfare department had come to take Aboriginal children), both white and black children would run and hide in the bush, the white children unaware that the child welfare department had come only for Aboriginal children. The camps remained after the Depression eased in 1934. Happy Valley was closed in 1939 by Randwick Council following pressure from the NSW Golf Course. Residents were rehoused and the huts demolished. Post World War II migrants from Poland, Russia, the Ukraine, Germany, Malta and the Middle East who were either unemployed or homeless from the severe post-war housing shortage, joined Aboriginal people from the South Coast at the Frog Hollow and Hill 60 camps. These camps were closed in the 1950s and their occupants rehoused in the La Perouse and Matraville areas. The last huts were demolished in the 1960s. Pam Koeneman, a long-term resident of La Perouse, commented that the mixing in of considerable numbers of Anglo-Celtic and European migrant Australians with the Aboriginal communities of La Perouse (both on the reserve or in the camps) resulted in a naturally occurring social experiment at La Perouse that began in the Depression years and which sat outside government policies of assimilation. =Housing and land rights at La Perouse, 1960s to 1980s= A scheme to provide cheap housing at La Perouse was introduced when Happy Valley was closed down. The houses were extremely basic boxes that had to be completed by the residents with no water, sewerage or electricity connections. Intended for white Australians, the scheme enabled some Aboriginal people to buy houses outside the reserve. Randwick Council attempted again in the 1960s to close the reserve, to improve the image of La Perouse. Jack Horner, honorary secretary of the Australian-Aboriginal Fellowship wrote repeatedly to Randwick Council, the NSW and Federal governments asking for improved housing conditions, opposing the closure and relocation of the reserve and organising a petition. Once again Aboriginal Australians at La Perouse refused to move, and eventually the planned relocation was abandoned. In 1966, Aboriginal land rights in New South Wales became a heated political issue. A Joint Parliamentary Inquiry into the Welfare of Aboriginals turned its attention to the reserve at La Perouse. Assimilation had been intended to gradually incorporate Aboriginal people into wider society, yet here they were living separate from, and in worse conditions than, the majority of white Australians. The Aborigines Protection Board and Randwick Council advocated closure of the reserve. The Inquiry, however, recognised the connections between Aboriginal people and the land and instead proposed a plan known as the \\"Endeavour Project.\\" This would create a village where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people would live together. The project never eventuated, however, because Aboriginal people on the reserve argued that they had the right to keep the reserve for Aboriginal people only. Instead, the reserve was redeveloped in 1972, and in 1973 it was handed to the NSW Aboriginal Lands Trust (following the abolition of the Aborigines Protection Board). Reserve residents filed a land claim to have ownership passed to them and in 1984 the newly established La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council was given the deeds to the reserve lands. The La Perouse Aboriginal community was the first Aboriginal community in Sydney to win freehold title to lands under the NSW Aboriginal Lands Right Act. In 2008 there were around 420 people living at La Perouse with over one-third of the population being Aboriginal. =La Perouse Mission Church= The church was built around 1894 at an unknown location on Frenchmans Beach. In 1929-30 the church was relocated to its present site up the hill behind the beach at the corner of Adina and Elaroo Avenues. It was probably largely rebuilt during this relocation. The church remained in use until the 1990s when services ceased. The last appointed minister/missionary left in 1999. The church is situated on the former seven-acre (2.4 ha) Aboriginal reserve at La Perouse that was established by the NSW colonial government in 1885. During the late 1880s, missionary work began among the Aboriginal people at La Perouse, performed by a number of Christian groups. From one of these groups‚Äîthe Petersham Congregational Christian Endeavour‚Äîan Aboriginal committee was formed. This group, (later called the La Perouse Aborigines Christian Endeavour Society) built the original mission church at the reserve in 1894, on Frenchman's Beach. In 1894 the Mission House was built, Miss Jenny Watson was appointed as the first full-time missionary and the La Perouse Aborigines Christian Endeavour Society was formed with seven active members. In 1897 Retta Dixon (aged only 19) replaced Jenny Watson as the resident missionary. Of the missionaries who worked at the church in its earliest decades, arguably the most important was Margaret Jane (Retta) Long (nee Dixon) (1878-1956) the daughter of Irish-born Baptists. Retta joined the New South Wales Christian Endeavour Union and began evangelizing at La Perouse Aborigines' Reserve where Christian Endeavour conducted Sunday services. Her father, Mathew Dixon, built two rooms onto the La Perouse church. In 1899 the mission reconstituted itself as the New South Wales Aborigines' Mission (NSWAM) and shortly after Retta began work as a travelling missionary to Aboriginal communities in NSW. La Perouse became the base for evangelising Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal people at La Perouse helped to secure Retta's welcome when she contacted Aboriginal communities on the NSW South Coast, and the Hawkesbury and Macleay rivers. From 1897 to 1901 Retta was instrumental in setting up 26 camps on the South Coast. Public transport, and whatever the Christian Endeavour network supplied, were Retta's only means of travel. In 1899 she walked seventy miles (113 km) during one visit to South Coast communities. Retta held a profound belief in the power of the Gospel to transform the lives of \\"sinners\\". She considered the Aboriginal people to be in no way \\"inferior to the white race\\". She came to admire their spirituality, generosity and endurance. As a young missionary she was happy to accept their hospitality and their company on her journeys. Unable to pay in full the money it owed, the NSWAM resolved in 1902 to function as a \\"faith mission\\" and to rely on God to supply its needs. Retta's role was supervisory in the field and inspirational there and elsewhere. She was an able publicist and her success encouraged support. The evangelical press reported in detail her travel, her needs (a lady's bicycle), her appearances at Sunday services, and the \\"bright singing and testimonies\\" of Aborigines with whom she worked. In 1905 Retta left the NSWAM and La Perouse for Singleton to form the Aborigines' Inland Mission of Australia (AIM) that she ran as a faith mission (initially with her husband William, during his lifetime) for the rest of her life. AIM became one of the largest missionary societies that worked exclusively for Australian Aboriginal people in the 20th century.O'Brien: 142 The founding of AIM led to the creation of a number of missions in various other parts of Australia, but especially in NSW and Queensland. Retta's mission assisted dispossessed and semi-urban Aborigines. When she began her work, Aboriginal communities were re-forming on recently gazetted reserves, and in camps on town commons and river banks. This resulted in the physical separation and isolation of their communities. With government permission, the AIM built a church and a missionary residence on many of the reserves. Its missionaries lived among the Aborigines, often in similar material circumstances. According to Long's autobiography, \\"the most striking feature of the [missionary] work itself in this period was the appearance of a native ministry\\" in 1924. Other than Retta Long, probably the most significant figure at La Perouse Mission Church was \\"Queen\\" Emma Timbery (c.1842-1916) an Aboriginal shellworker and \\"matriarch\\" of the La Perouse community. Emma married George ('Trimmer') Timbery at Botany in 1864 and by 1882 the Timbery's had moved to La Perouse where Aboriginal women earned extra income by gathering wildflowers and making shell baskets for sale in Sydney and the suburbs. Emma was particularly accomplished at the craft of shellwork‚Äîadorning small items such as boxes, baby shoes and boomerangs with shells. Shellwork had probably been introduced by missionaries who had spent time in the Pacific, as it appears to have no basis in traditional Aboriginal art forms. Aboriginal women at La Perouse became well known for their shellwork. This was a social activity, carried out in the company of other women. Each shellworker had an individual style. Emma regularly displayed and sold her handiwork at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney. In 1910 Emma's work was included in an exhibition of Australian manufactures in London. One Sydney newspaper reported that it was \\"almost fought for\\". Emma was converted to Christianity in the early 1890s and began working with the missionaries at the La Perouse Aboriginal settlement, from whom she learned to read a little. In 1894 the La Perouse Aborigines' Christian Endeavour Society was formed, and Emma became its vice-president in 1895. That year the seven acres (2.4 ha) occupied by the La Perouse Aboriginal settlement was gazetted as a reserve for its residents' exclusive use. Through their Christian work, she and the missionary Retta Dixon became \\"friends and comrades\\". When Dixon was installed as missionary at La Perouse in 1897, Emma, in front of a large crowd, promised Retta's father and friends to be a mother to her. Emma Timbery continued her missionary work with Retta Long. The two women often travelled together, visiting other Aboriginal settlements along the south coast to \\"spread the word\\". Emma made a valued contribution to the early work of the La Perouse (United) Aborigines Mission. As the community matriarch, Emma became popularly known as \\"Queen\\", or \\"Granny\\" Timbery (sometimes spelt Timbury). She died on 26 November 1916 at La Perouse, survived by her husband, three sons and one daughter. Emma was buried in Botany cemetery, \\"in the presence of a large company of mourners\\", with her funeral expenses paid for by a \\"white friend\\", indicating her close association with missionaries and their supporters. A tribute in the Australian Aborigines Advocate noted that \\"many wreaths and other floral tributes were sent along, and numerous letters of sympathy from white and dark friends\\". The La Perouse community believes that Queen Emma Timbery was granted by Queen Victoria lands corresponding to the present-day LALC landholding. Papers to this effect, however, were destroyed in a house fire on the reserve in the 1950s or 1960s. Emma's grandson Joseph (1912-1978) won repute as a boomerang maker, and demonstrated his throwing skill on the Eiffel Tower in Paris and for Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to Sydney in 1954. The family workshop became the Bidjigal Aboriginal Corporation, based at Huskisson, Jervis Bay. Three fig trees at La Perouse Aboriginal reserve were dedicated in 1986 to the memory of Emma Timbery. The tradition of shellworking continued to be practised by many of her female descendants, including her great-granddaughter Esma Russell, nee Timbery. In 1929-30 the church was relocated to its current site at La Perouse, along with the rest of the settlement, because the buildings were sinking into the sand. The church was most probably rebuilt at this time. (The extent of rebuilding in the church's relocation should become clearer as the church is opened up for conservation works). The new church building featured six leaded glass windows and many internal memorial plaques. An adjacent residence with Sunday school rooms (the Manse building) was constructed in, or shortly before, 1934 and was dedicated to the United Aborigines Mission (UAM). The La Perouse Aboriginal Mission later became the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) which was a significant group in the history of the La Perouse Mission Church. Founded by white Protestants and based in Melbourne the UAM was similar to the NSW- based AIM. Both the UAM and the AIM were non-denominational faith missions and local missionary movements dedicated specifically to evangelising among the Aboriginal peoples. While Aboriginal people were a low priority for the major denominations, AIM and UAM together accounted for almost half of all missionaries working with Aboriginal people. They attracted large numbers of women missionaries, who consistently outnumbered the men. By the 1930s, the UAM was laying claim to the La Perouse Mission Church in the plaque erected on the Manse building in 1934. A 1950s UAM publication notes that this church was the mother church of the mission's work across Australia. O'Brien comments that Aboriginal people generally recall AIM and UAM missionaries with affection. This view is fully supported by the La Perouse community.O'Brien: 122, 143, 151Friends of La Perouse: 2012, pers. comm Missionaries of the 1950s to the 1990s are remembered as being generally married couples with families. Occasionally children of the La Perouse community would live with the missionaries at the mission house (the Manse). The missionaries are recalled with great affection by the current community. There were periods of time when there was no ministers at the church and services were not held. Ministers at La Perouse were non-Indigenous until the later decades when Aboriginal ministers Pastors Benjamin Cruse, Ray Minnicon and Mark Naden served in the 1980s and 1990s. The last missionary at La Perouse was Tom Coe, who left in 1999. The last burial service at the church was in 1986 but baptisms took place at least up until 1988. Services ceased in the 1990s. Howard and Evelyn Miles were missionaries at La Perouse in the 1960s and 70s. They printed the United Aborigines Mission publications at the Manse in this period. They also brought in Aboriginal missionary women from the Northern Territory (remembered as Dorothy, Marlene and Jessie) to work at La Perouse. While most of the church's congregation was Aboriginal, non-Aboriginal people did attend church services, particularly post WWII European migrants from the nearby camps (until these were disbanded). The children from the camps and the reserve also mixed at the local public school. The present La Perouse Aboriginal community notes the strong social and spiritual significance of the La Perouse Mission Church to present and past community members. The church provided its community with a strong sense of spirituality, without requiring a connection to organised Christian worship and observance. Hymn singing was a favourite church activity and singing (either accompanied by the church organ or unaccompanied) was particularly important to the La Perouse church community. Hymn singing took place in people's homes, often while sitting outside on their front steps. Children sang in groups at other churches and when visiting the sick and elderly of the community. Hymn singing was part of the popular culture of the La Perouse community. Some families also learned to play the organ through the church. The church encouraged adult, child and family involvement. Bible study was for the adults only and took place in people's homes. Adult community members sometimes attended conventions at country-based Aboriginal mis1sions with which La Perouse was linked, such at Wreck Bay on the South Coast, Taree on the North Coast and Purfleet in Queensland. Young children attended Sunday School at the Manse. Community members often taught at Sunday School. Children sang in choirs, marched into town with banners and performed Nativity plays and sang Christmas carols. There was a large Women's Group at the church and the Youth Group (called Christian Endeavour) met on Tuesday afternoons after school. Youth activities included cooking sessions at the Manse and dancing for girls and boys. Youth and adult church social activities included dancing, to old time and rock and roll music, at the Blue Hall (now demolished) that was located to the west of the Manse (outside the proposed SHR curtilage). The Blue Hall was also used for children's dance and ballet classes and movie screenings and (from the 1960s) a television was installed. The entry charge for films and TV shows (Bandstand was a favourite) was 6d (6 old pence). The state government ran summer camps for Aboriginal children and young people for two weeks in early January on the flat ground south of the Blue Hall (also outside the proposed SHR curtilage). All these activities took place variously in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.Friends of La Perouse: 2012, pers. comm. Present day community members note that attendance at church services and social activities was not something forced on children and young people but was willingly undertaken by community members who participated generally until at least 18 or 19 years of age. It is also noted that church services and church social activities were the only times that Aboriginal children and young people were allowed out in the reserve without being under the watchful eye of their families. This indicates the long-held community fear of children being taken without warning by \\"the welfare\\" to become part of the Stolen Generations. The La Perouse Mission Church was regarded by Aboriginal community as a safe haven for its children and as such its activities were well-supported by all ages in the community. Iris Williams, who lived on the reserve, recalls her mother preaching at the church and giving funeral sermons. Gloria Ardler attended the church on Sundays and other church activities such as Sunday school picnics and parties that were held near the Mission House. She recalls that the organ was played by Mrs Cook and Mrs Foster and that the \\"little church was always full\\". Nearly all the reserve population were married at the church, had their babies baptised there and their funeral services held there. But there were periods when no services were held.La Perouse: 61  Description  A small Gothic, weatherboard, white-painted church. The church was originally built on the beach at Frenchman's Beach in 1894. A surviving published black and white photograph shows this building to have been a simple one-room gabled structure with only one six-paned window in the long side wall. The church was relocated to its present site at the corner of Elaroo Avenue and Adina Avenue, La Perouse in 1929‚Äì30 and appears to have been rebuilt (or largely rebuilt) at this time. The extent to which the church was rebuilt in its relocation is likely to be clarified when the building is opened up for conservation works as marks in the timber will be apparent. The church faces east and has a gabled porch, a bellcote, a nave and six lancet coloured glass windows (three on each side). Several of the window frames and coloured glass panels are broken and some of the glass is lying inside the church. The timber picket fence surrounding the church is likely to be a later replacement. There is a wooden plaque to the AEC Colebrook Memorial Aboriginal Evangelical Church on the exterior wall of the church beside the porch. The interior of the church was inspected and its contents noted in May 2012. There are six rows of timber pews on each side of a centre aisle. The pews are adjustable and are believed to have originally been tram seats. At the altar end, there is a timber pulpit with two adjacent organs, a plaqued timber chair and a stool. On the wall behind the pulpit there are mounted: a hymn board, a painted scroll, a green blackboard, and a stone plaque. The plaque is inscribed: \\"Ye serve the Lord Christ Col.3.24. - In Loving Memory of Miss H Baker Missionary at La Perouse who spent her life in loving service among the native people - called home April 1951- 40 years in the work - to the Glory of God.\\" The pulpit is plaqued: Presented by Mr C Barton - designed and constructed by Mr Jas. Jago - to the Glory of God. The hymn board is also plaqued. Anecdotal evidence indicates there was no altar nor a font, but that a large bowl of water was brought in for baptisms. The chair behind the pulpit is plaqued: \\"In loving memory of our dear little son Lyle A Stuart - age 11 months - safe in the arms of God.\\" (date unclear). All six windows have small metal plaques on the timber sills. Plaques are dedicated as follows: # William AB Smith the Boy Preacher - Assisted in the Services at this Mission # To the Glory of God and Loving Memory - Richard and Lydia Playford whose love and devotion to the workers and native people as shown by their kindly deeds till called home - Donated by their family # This window is a gift - Mrs Anne Baker - in loving memory of her husband Inspector WT Baker - for many years the friend of the Aborigines - To the Glory of God # To the Glory of God who made one of all the nations - this window is dedicated to the Memory of Lizzie, Clara and other loyal native Christians who in past years upheld our hands - Donated by Miss Baker # This window is dedicated to the memory of George A Corbitt whose love and devotion to the native People was shown in his work among them # The plaque on the sixth window was inaccessible and not sited at the May 2012 inspection. Two sliding frosted glass-panelled doors (which appear to be original) connect the entrance porch to the church nave. Surmounted above the doors inside the church is a wooden boomerang inscribed \\"United Aborigines Mission\\" with a metal plaque inscribed: \\"To the Glory of God - these doors are a special gift in loving memory of my dear husband Thomas E Colebrook late President of this Mission\\". At the opposite end to the porch there is a rear door (in the western wall) and a framed poster hangs on the internal southern wall. There are several items of moveable heritage located in the entrance porch and around the pulpit and two organs. These include hymn books, printed booklets and pages, a timber box of hymn cards and a wooden framed brass plaque inscribed: Pastor Benjamin Cruse - 84 years - passed into the presence of the Lord on the 4th April 1990 - his dedicated service spanned over 35 years and 17 years pastored the La Perouse Colbrook (sic) Memorial Peoples Church. A respected Aboriginal Christian leader whose life touched so many lives setting the highest role model standards for every level of society in Christian integrity - John 14.1.6. A bell was run for Sunday services and Sunday School, but this has not been located to date (pers. comm. 'Friends of La Perouse'). The Manse building that adjoins the western side of the church is believed to date from 1934 (soon after the church's relocation). A commemorative plaque on the exterior entrance was of the Manse is inscribed: 'United Aborigines Mission This tablet was laid by Rev EJ Telfer on 20 October 1934 to record God's goodness in providing this mission house and to recall happy memories of Mrs TE Colebrook whose house was always open.' The mosaic entrance step to the Manse building is inlaid with the initials 'U.A.M.' The interior of the Manse building was not inspected in May 2012. Community advice is that the building has been extensively modified over time and that there is no surviving fabric to demonstrate the existence of printing activity for the UAM mission publications, including The Messenger newspaper, that were run from the building in the 1960s and 1970s by Howard and Evelyn Miles. Services to the building have been disconnected and the building has been condemned by Randwick Council.May 2012 The Manse building is not considered to be of heritage significance, with the exception of the plaque and entrance step. The retention in situ of the exterior wall and plaque and the entrance step and their incorporation into any new re-development is recommended. On the grassed area south of the church building is a small sandstone outcrop ( by ) with two pecked and grooved engravings. # One engraving is of a large kangaroo measuring a total of which appears to be looking over its right shoulder towards the west. The tail is covered by an over-growth of grass. # The second engraving is of a human figure of approximately holding a boomerang in his left hand, showing the fingers gripping the boomerang. The human figure is holding a spear in his right hand and looks to be about to throw the spear at the kangaroo. The legs have been overgrown by grass. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the two figures were carved in 1931 by Burt Tambar, Bob Simms and Jack Simms of the La Perouse community, in connection with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in March 1932. = Condition = As at 16 July 2012, the building is in poor condition. Some windows and window frames are broken (but much of the original broken glass remains inside the church). The church has not been used since services ceased in the 1990s. = Modifications and dates = The church was relocated from Frenchman's Beach to its present location in 1929-30 when it is believed it was rebuilt. 1930s inclusions were: * Six leaded glass windows * Roof of corrugated asbestos sheeting * Ceiling of asbestos sheeting * Internal memorial plaques * Church furniture * Adjacent Manse building (used as residence, for Sunday School and for printing the UAM newspaper) was built in, or shortly before, 1934. = Further information = It is considered that the extent to which the church was rebuilt in the course of its 1929-30 relocation will become apparent from marks in the timber when the church is opened up for conservation works.  Heritage listing  As at 10 July 2012, La Perouse Mission Church is significant in the history of the Aboriginal Christian movement in NSW. It is an important antecedent to the Indigenous Christian organisation that exists today, such as Australian Indigenous Ministries. As an early church establishment , the La Perouse Mission Church was held to be the mother church of the United Aborigines Mission, from which centre the Mission spread to all parts of Australia. Within the Aboriginal Christian movement, the La Perouse Church demonstrates the critical and successful role of female missionaries, both Aboriginal and European, in evangelising the Aboriginal people. The church has strong associations with two significant missionary figures of its early period: one European and one Aboriginal. Retta Long, the church's first and highly successful resident missionary, was an important figure of state significance in Aboriginal missionary work who left the La Perouse Mission Church to found one of the largest missionary societies that worked exclusively for the Aboriginal people. \\"Queen\\" Emma Timbery, an Aboriginal woman and \\"matriarch\\" of the La Perouse community who lived on the reserve, was one of the earliest Aboriginal converts to be involved in mission work. Emma worked and travelled with Retta throughout her period as resident missionary at La Perouse. Emma's evangelical work extended beyond her missionary assistance to include leadership of the La Perouse Aboriginal Christians. The La Perouse Aboriginal community has exceptional historic significance in the context of Aboriginal survival of European settlement. Some of the Aboriginal community of La Perouse have an unbroken connection to the land for over 7500 years. Members of the Timbery family living in La Perouse today can trace their ancestors back to pre-contact times. Many current La Perouse residents have strong connections with the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay on the NSW South Coast. These connections fostered the growth of the La Perouse community in the 1870s when La Perouse became an informal refuge for many from the South Coast who were forced off their lands by the spread of dairy farming. The church demonstrates the historical significance of the Aboriginal community of La Perouse in the post-contact era as the only community in Sydney that held on to its territory in the face of repeated threats of relocation. The church, located on the Aboriginal reserve, demonstrates the robustness and resilience of the La Perouse Aboriginal community to official threats to the community's existence over time. Additionally, the church demonstrates the capacity of the La Perouse Aboriginal community to adapt to and establish changed living conditions and relationships with Europeans from a wide variety of backgrounds and ethnicities who populated the La Perouse area during and after the Depression era. Many relationships, partnerships and families grew from the interaction of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities on the La Perouse reserve and in the Happy Valley, Frog Hollow and Hill 60 camps in the period when the La Perouse Mission Church was still active in worship. The La Perouse Mission Church has social and spiritual significance to the past, present and dispersed Aboriginal community of La Perouse. For virtually all the 20th century (and earlier) the La Perouse Mission Church was an important spiritual, cultural and social focus of the life of the Aboriginal community of the La Perouse reserve (and later the Local Aboriginal Land Council landholding). Church services and activities were willingly and well-supported by all ages of the community. They are remembered as enriching the life of the community and were seen by the community as a safe and happy environment where its children and young people would be beyond the reach of the government and safe from its policy of Aboriginal child-taking. The missionary leaders are remembered with affection by the present community. The Aboriginal rock engravings on the site that were created in connection with the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 are an important demonstration of the continued cultural practice of engraving on sandstone by Aboriginal people. In this instance the engravings also demonstrate Aboriginal engagement with European historical processes and events of state significance. The La Perouse Mission Church may be a rare example of a surviving early timber missionary church in Sydney or NSW that is still held in high esteem by the local Aboriginal community. La Perouse Mission Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. La Perouse Mission church is very important in the history of the Aboriginal Christian movement in NSW and was an important antecedent to the Indigenous Christian organisation that exist today, such as Australian Indigenous Ministries. As an early church establishment , the La Perouse Mission Church was held to be the mother church of the United Aborigines Mission, from which centre the Mission spread to all parts of Australia. Within the Aboriginal Christian movement, the La Perouse Church demonstrates the critical and successful role of female missionaries, both Aboriginal and European, in evangelising the Aboriginal people. Retta Long, the church's first and highly successful resident missionary, was an important figure of state significance in Aboriginal missionary work who left the La Perouse Mission Church to found one of the largest missionary societies working exclusively for the Aboriginal people. \\"Queen\\" Emma Timbery, who lived on the La Perouse reserve, was one of the earliest Aboriginal converts involved in mission work. She assisted Retta in her missionary work throughout Retta's period as resident missionary at La Perouse. \\"Native helpers\\" came into increasing importance of the following decades and Retta appointed as many women as men to these positions. Emma's evangelical work extended beyond her missionary assistance to Retta to include leadership of the La Perouse Aboriginal Christians. The La Perouse Aboriginal community has exceptional historic significance in the context of Aboriginal survival of European settlement. Some of the Aboriginal community of La Perouse have an unbroken connection to the land for over 7500 years. Members of the Timbery family living in La Perouse today can trace their ancestors back to pre-contact times. Many current La Perouse residents have strong connections with the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay on the NSW South Coast that likely predate the establishment of the reserve at La Perouse. These connections are considered to have fostered the growth of the La Perouse community in the 1870s when it became an informal refuge for many from the South Coast who were forced off their lands by the spread of dairy farming. The church demonstrates the historical significance of the Aboriginal community of La Perouse in the post-contact era as the only community in Sydney that held on to its territory in the face of repeated threats of relocation away from La Perouse. The church, located on the Aboriginal reserve, demonstrates the robustness and resilience of the La Perouse Aboriginal community to official threats to the community's existence over time. Additionally, the church demonstrates the capacity of the La Perouse Aboriginal community to adapt to and establish changed living conditions and relationships with Europeans from a wide variety of backgrounds and ethnicities who populated the La Perouse area during and after the Depression era. Many relationships, partnerships and families grew from the interaction of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities on the La Perouse reserve and in the Happy Valley, Frog Hollow and Hill 60 camps. Following the demise of the camps, new residential communities grew up in La Perouse and Matraville that were serviced by the La Perouse Mission Church. The Aboriginal rock engravings on the site demonstrate the La Perouse community's engagement with European historical processes (in this case the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. La Perouse Mission Church has important associations with two significant missionary women: one Aboriginal and one European. Margaret Jane (Retta) Long (nee Dixon) (1878-1956) was the first resident missionary La Perouse in the late 1890s. Although aged only 19, Retta was responsible for the evangelising of large numbers of Aboriginal people, not only at the La Perouse Mission but also in the Hawkesbury region, the Macleay River on the North Coast and the South Coast. Out of Retta's work at La Perouse was born the Aborigines Inland Mission (AIM) which became the most successful broad-based Indigenous missionary society in NSW to that time. AIM set up a number of missions in various parts of NSW, beginning with one at Singleton in 1905. She continued to direct AIM until the early 1950s, shortly before her death in 1956. Retta's achievement is all the more remarkable given that both the missions she directed (the NSW Aborigines Mission at La Perouse and AIM, which was state-wide) functioned as \\"faith\\" missions from 1902. 'Queen' Emma Timbery (also known as \\"Granny\\" Timbery) (1842-1916) was a matriarchal figure in the La Perouse Aboriginal community where she lived form c. 1882 to 1816. Following her conversion to Christianity in the early 1890s, Emma became Vice-President of the La Perouse Aborigines Christian Endeavour Society. From 1897 she worked with Retta Long, the resident missionary at La Perouse. Together the two women travelled and performed missionary work with Aboriginal people throughout NSW. Emma was one of the earliest Aboriginal missionary helpers; a position that grew in importance in later decades. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The two 1931 Aboriginal rock engravings on the site demonstrate the continued cultural practice of engraving on sandstone. They were produced to mark the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in March 1932 and demonstrate the La Perouse Aboriginal community's engagement with a non-Indigenous event of state significance through the cultural practice of engraving. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The La Perouse Mission Church has social and spiritual significance to the past, present and dispersed Aboriginal community of La Perouse. It demonstrates the strength and focus of the community's spiritual connection through the church's services and its cultural and social activities that willingly engaged all ages of the community over along period of time. For virtually all the 20th century (and earlier) the La Perouse Mission Church was an important spiritual, cultural and social focus of the life of the Aboriginal community of the La Perouse reserve (and later the Local Aboriginal Land Council landholding). Church services and activities are remembered as enriching the life of the community and being willingly and well-supported by all ages of the community. The church and its social activities were seen by the community as a safe and happy environment where its children and young people would be beyond the reach of the government and safe from its policy of Aboriginal child-taking. The missionary leaders are remembered with affection by the present community. The general La Perouse community and the La Perouse LALC support the listing. Among these supporters many also seek to reopen the church for worship and as a hub for community social activities. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item is not considered to be significant under this criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. La Perouse Mission Church may be a rare surviving example of a timber church built on an Aboriginal reserve specifically for missionary work to the Aboriginal people which continues to be held in high community esteem. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. La Perouse Mission Church is a representative example of a common small timber church of the type often found in rural areas but which is relatively rare in Sydney.

Biography  Pischikov was born on April 12, 1983 in a loving family in the settlement of Bulanash, Sverdlovsk Oblast, but was born with a congenital disease. His childhood was happy, but after the collapse of the USSR his father was left without work and soon died. All of the family's worries fell upon the shoulders of the mother, Lyuba Ivanovna, who worked at the Artyomovsk radio plant, who did not notice how her son was straying from the right path. Soon she married Alexander Anushin, an electric locomotive driver, but he turned out to be an alcoholic who did not even try to establish relationships with the child. Pischikov left school after the 5th grade, repeatedly running into the police for theft and hooliganism. Outwardly, he appeared to be a modest and shy boy. Pischikov came to Moscow in June 2000. A year later, he was arrested for attempting to steal the radio from a car. However, the mask of a modest fellow helped him, and he, having signed a written undertaking not to leave, disappeared. He was declared wanted on the federal list, but was not sought after seriously. Pischikov at first settled in the Vladimir Oblast with his friend, but soon after, he met a girl, with whom he began to live. At first, he worked on the construction of country houses, then at a tire store, but did not stay there for a long time. Subsequently, he deceived his partner that he worked, bringing home the money that he took from the homes of the retirees he killed. The first murder carried out by Pischikov occurred on March 29, 2002 in the village of Pashnevo, in the Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District. He stole 3000 rubles from the house of the murdered pensioner Lebedev. The next murder occurred on November 8, 2002, in the village of Potochino, Moscow Oblast, but this time he had a smaller bounty of 700 rubles. He killed the next victim on January 17, 2003, but could not steal any money, since he did not find any in the house. In a number of cases, Pischikov also took food from the refrigerator of the pensioners he killed, sometimes even while at the crime scenes. On March 18, 2003, Pischikov committed two consecutive murders in the village of Gubin in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing 950 rubles and a piece of sausage. On March 31 of the same year, Pischikov committed two more murders in the village of Korovino, again in the Orekhovo-Zuevsky District, stealing a total of 1120 rubles from both murders. This suggested that Pischikov was not robbing - he was killing instead. On April 3, 2003, Pischikov committed his last murder in the village of Voinova Gora, killing a pensioner and his 50-year-old daughter. However, the daughter miraculously had survived. Pischikov was arrested in the city of Likino-Dulyovo. When he was walking along the street and looking for another place to burglarize, he was noticed by a pensioner. He called the police and, at his own risk, began to pursue the perpetrator. Soon, Pischikov was arrested on a deserted street. He began to give evidence on the way to the police station, confessing to all the murders. He however did not repent to the questioners, and according to the investigators' stories: \\"Pischikov did not even understand what else they wanted from him, except his cooperation with the investigation\\". In July 2004, the court sentenced Denis Pischikov to life imprisonment. In a petition for clemency, he wrote: \\"Have pity on me! Anything but life!\\". The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change, after which Pischikov was sent to the White Swan prison.

The maximum draft of the vessel, limited by the port of Sabetta in the Gulf of Ob, is . The vessel's design deadweight tonnage is 50,000 tons. The hull of the vessel is strengthened to ice class Arc7 according to the requirements of the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. This allows the vessel to operate in up to thick first-year ice during the winter and spring navigation seasons, and in second-year ice during summer and autumn. In addition, operation is allowed along the full length of the Northern Sea Route, but in heavy ice conditions icebreaker escort is required.Rules for the Classification and Construction of Sea-Going Ships Part I: Classification. Russian Maritime Register of Shipping, 2018. Since the vessel is designed according to the double acting ship principle, the stern of the vessel is strengthened in the same way as the bow. In order to offset the increased scantlings, the hull is made mainly out of high-strength shipbuilding steel. The vessel is also thoroughly winterized for operation in ambient temperatures down to and features a covered forward mooring deck to protect the deck equipment from icing. = Power and propulsion = While a typical Handymax tanker would have a single conventional shaft line and propulsion power in the range of , Yuriy Kuchiev is designed to operate independently in difficult ice conditions and thus requires a specialized propulsion system as well as significantly more installed power. The diesel- electric power plant consists of two 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V32 and two 16-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving alternators. In addition, there is a harbor diesel generator. For propulsion, Yuriy Kuchiev has two ABB Azipod VI2300 azimuthing propulsion units with stainless steel propellers. The propulsion units are of pulling type, meaning that the propeller is always facing the direction of motion: when breaking ice in astern direction (backwards), the propellers are turned around to face the stern of the vessel and help with the icebreaking process. Yuriy Kuchiev is designed to break level ice in a continuous motion with a speed of in astern direction. When sailing bow-first, the icebreaking capability is about .

Sopranos also use it as an audition piece,http://opera.wolftrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Soprano- Aria-Frequency-List-2017.pdf as it displays the singer's high and low registers, forte and pianissimo volumes, legato bel canto singing technique, and several dramatic emotions such as reverence, longing, and resignation. Tu che le vanit√† is the title of a 1981 novel by Italian musicologist and author Rodolfo Celletti. Sentiment The aria begins with a long, c. 3 minutes, orchestral prelude. √âlisabeth de Valois, a young French Princess whom the elderly King Philip II of Spain has married for political reasons, prays at the tomb of the former Emperor King Carlos V. She asks that he weep for her suffering and offer his tears to the Almighty on her behalf. She anticipates the arrival of her stepson and former fianc√© Don Carlo, whom she has piously rejected after marrying his father the King in order to strengthen the alliance of their two nations. She prays that Carlos will fulfil his destiny as a great, benevolent ruler of Spain. She recalls her homeland, and her happiness during her short engagement to Carlos. She longs for the peace which she will have in her grave. A performance takes between 10 and 12 minutes. Text The French libretto to Don Carlos was by Joseph M√©ry and Camille du Locle. The aria's French incipit is \\"Toi qui sus le n√©ant\\". The libretto was translated into Italian by .

In the absence of formal diplomatic relations, the building functioned as a de facto embassy and provided a direct communication channel for the two nations. It was headed by North Korean Representative Jon Jong-su, vice chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and South Korean Representative Chun Hae-sung, vice minister of the Ministry of Unification. The four-story office building was demolished by North Korea on 16 June 2020. It had been vacant since January due to the COVID-19 pandemic. History The joint liaison office was established as part of Panmunjom Declaration signed by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in on 27 April 2018, during the 2018 inter-Korean Summit in Panmunjom. The office was located in a four-story and a basement building with an area of 4498.57m2 constructed in 2005 for the Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Consultation Office. The construction cost at the time was 8.0 billion KRW ($7.1 million) paid by the South Korean government. On 11 October 2018, it was reported that a water treatment plant which will be used by the Inter-Korean Liaison Office had been restored. By 25 October 2018, renovation and repairs to the building which houses the Inter-Korean Liaison Office were complete. The South Korean government spent 9.7 billion KRW ($8.6 million) on these renovations. The first meeting at the Liaison Office occurred between delegates from both Koreas on 22 October 2018 and concerned, among other things, forestry cooperation between both Koreas. A meeting took place at the office between South Korean Vice Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Roh Tae-kang and North Korean Vice-Minister of Physical Culture and Sports Won Kil U on 2 November 2018, talks at the office resulted in bids for a unified Korean team at the 2020 Olympics and to hold the 2032 Summer Olympics in both Koreas. Another meeting was held on 2 November 2018 between South Korean Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung and his North Korean counterpart, Jon Jong- su. Both men were co-heads of the office and each serve as liaison chief for their perspective country. Both Chun and Jon discussed cooperation in various joint-Korean projects. Due to measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the office was closed on 30 January 2020. Destruction of building On 16 June 2020 at 2:50 pm, the four-story building was demolished by North Korea. North Korea's news agency, the Korean Central News Agency released a statement saying that \\"the liaison office was tragically ruined with a terrific explosion\\" and that it reflected \\"the mind-set of the enraged people\\" of their country. On 13 June, three days before the building was destroyed, Kim Yo- jong, the sister of Kim Jong-un, had predicted the collapse of the building as a retaliation for a failure by South Korea to crack down on North Korean defectors living in South Korea who used balloons to send anti-North Korean regime leaflets across the border. The destruction coincided with the 20th anniversary of the first inter-Korean summit between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il. Surveillance cameras in South Korea showed that when the building was destroyed, a neighboring high-rise building that previously housed South Korean officials partially collapsed due to the strength of the blast. South Korean president Moon Jae-in responded by heightening the South Korean military's alert level and saying there would be a stern response if North Korea continued to raise tensions. A statement released by the Blue House, South Korea's executive office, said that the building's destruction \\"is an act that goes against the expectations of those who wish for the development of South-North relations and the settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula,\\" and that \\"the government makes it clear that the responsibility for everything that follows this is entirely on the North's side.\\" See also * North Korea‚ÄìSouth Korea relations * Korean reunification References External links *A video at the moment of blasting the Inter-Korean Liaison Office, Yonhapnews 2018 establishments in North Korea 2020 disestablishments in Asia De facto embassies Organizations established in 2018 Demolished buildings and structures in North Korea Buildings and structures demolished in 2020 ","title":"Inter-Korean Liaison Office"},{"id":"58490841","text":"The Chinese Market Gardens is a heritage-listed market gardens at 1-39 Bunnerong Road, La Perouse, City of Randwick, New South Wales, Australia. It is also known as Chinese Gardens La Perouse, Phillip Bay, Matraville and Randwick. The property is Crown land and is owned by NSW Department of Industry, a department of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru- ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital.

Until the 1980s the gardens continued along the line of drainage on the eastern side of the road as well, and both sides were the subject of early attempts to list the gardens in 1979. =Aboriginal land= Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years. The population of Aboriginal people in the Sydney area was estimated by the First Fleet's Governor Phillip as being around 1500. The traditional owners of the land near La Perouse were the Kameygal, and their proximity to the coast meant that they enjoyed a plentiful supply of fish. The area also had fresh water supplies and places of natural shelter. Rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in the locality in evidence of their occupation. By the mid nineteenth century most Aboriginal people had either died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers or moved away in search of food and shelter. However, later in the 19th century Aboriginal people began moving back to this area, settling in La Perouse where there is still a considerable community, many having strong connections with the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay near Nowra on the NSW South Coast. From the early 20th century at least La Perouse became a tourist site for Sydneysiders where Aboriginal residents sold souvenirs such as boomerangs and \\"snake men\\" entertained spectators. In 1984 an Aboriginal land claim for the Aboriginal Reserve near the bay was successful.Dictionary of Sydney 'La Perouse'. More recently an Aboriginal land claim was made successfully on the sandy knoll adjoining the market gardens site known as Hill 60. In 2012 there is also an undecided Aboriginal land claim on the Chinese Market Gardens' three lots. =Colonial beginnings= When British colonisation of Australia as a penal colony began in 1788 the First Fleet initially landed at Yarra Bay, 300 meters from the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse, where its creek empties into Botany Bay. Governor Phillip quickly deemed the area unsuitable for settlement as too exposed and swampy with not enough fresh water. Within days the penal settlement had moved a few kilometres north to Port Jackson and found \\"a proper situation\\" at Sydney Cove. Sailing out of Botany Bay, the authorities on the First Fleet were probably alarmed to see two French ships entering the bay. This was a strangely coincidental meeting of the first two European expeditions to the east coast of Australia since Captain Cook's historic \\"discovery\\" in 1770. Captain of the French expedition, La Vicompte de La Perouse was on a scientific tour of the world, probably with imperialist underpinnings, and sought to replenish his supplies and rest his crew. They landed at a small bay next to Yarra Bay, now known as 'Frenchman's Bay' where they set up a stockade and planted European vegetable seeds in a plot that became known as 'the Frenchman's Gardens', probably intended to feed the crew on the return trip home. After setting sail in March 1788 La Perouse was never seen again (by Europeans) and the ruins of his ships were only discovered decades later, off the coast of what is now Vanuatu (Dictionary of Sydney 'La Perouse'). Local historian Greg Blaxland has suggested that the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse may have been established in the same place as La Perouse's vegetable garden of 1788, making it possibly the first site of European food cultivation in Australia.Blaxland, 1999 However Ivan Barko's study of the location of \\"The French Garden at La Perouse\\" demonstrates that while the location of the Frenchman's Gardens remains uncertain, it is almost certainly not the site of the Chinese Market Gardens. For example, he quotes from the writings of Victor Lottin, a Frenchman who visited in 1824, which states that La Perouse's plot was \\"located at 300 paces\\" distance from the tower'.Barko, 2011 Around 1822 the British had built a watchtower on a high point south of La Perouse's stockade and stationed troops there to keep watch for smugglers. This tower still stands (Dictionary of Sydney 'La Perouse') and is located about 2 km from the closest edge of the Chinese Market Gardens. Nonetheless the close proximity of the Frenchman's Gardens to the Chinese Market Gardens does add to their significance as a historic locality of food cultivation in NSW. The township of La Perouse is south of the Sydney central business district but was only connected to the city by road in 1869 and then by tram in 1902. The first telegraph cable between Australia and New Zealand was built at La Perouse in 1876. =Market Gardens in Randwick= The first farms in the La Perouse area were recorded in 1830 on land granted to John Brown on the shores of Botany Bay. His land grant was adjacent to the creek and north west of the subject gardens,. There he built Bunnerong House, the first private dwelling in Randwick municipality, and which was surrounded by orchards - making it another historic site of food cultivation in this locality. \\"Boonerong\\" is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"small creek\\" according to an 1831 letter from Brown to the Colonial Secretary.Read, 2011, 4-5 Later 19th century maps show numerous market gardens dotted throughout the municipality although Shirley Fitzgerald states that examination of relevant maps demonstrates that the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse site was not used for market gardening before 1904 (2012). According to Randwick - A Social History (1985), the market gardens in the south of the municipality in the vicinity of the Chinese Market Gardens, were established to capitalise on the fertile soil and abundant water from the swampy Botany Bay hinterland, that at one time vegetables were among the chief products of the locality. The Perumal Murphy heritage study of Randwick (1989) states that Chinese people were farming the market gardens at La Perouse from 1860 in the wake of the gold rushes. However Paul Rappoport's research into the history of lessees of the three lots at the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse suggests that the first formal sub-leases made to people with Chinese names dates only from 1909 (2008). A search of Sands Directories indicates that the first record of people with Chinese names living in the Bunnerong Road site date from the late 1920s. Randwick - A Social History (1985) suggests that before the 1860s, market gardens in the locality were owned and tended by Europeans, some being attached to the wealthiest homes in Randwick. However, by the 1860s many Chinese were coming into the area and working market gardens. Chinese people were discriminated against in NSW during the nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries, and after the gold rush market gardening was one of the few occupations open to them. As Daphne Lowe Kelley of the Chinese Heritage Association of Australia submitted: In the 19th and 20th centuries when faced with discriminatory attitudes and legislation, combined with restrictive laws, many of the early Chinese turned to market gardening for a living, growing vegetables for the Australian market. As well as market gardening, many Chinese were also employed in the wholesale and retail marketing of fruit and vegetables. Market gardening features as an occupation in the majority of Chinese Australian families whose forebears settled in Australia in the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.Kelley, 2012 Members of the Australian Chinese community have worked the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse for over a century, often passing control of it from one generation to another, or from one family to another. Many Chinese immigrants started their work life in Australia by working in market gardens such as these and then developed related business such as restaurants, food manufacture and the export of food. Sometimes market gardening was not a stand-alone enterprise but had connections with Dixon Street businesses (at the centre of Sydney's Chinatown) which in turn had connections with businesses in Hong Kong or China. Acquiring a lease apparently allowed a certain number of workers to come in. The more workers a company had, the easier it was to deploy them across the state to work in rural stores and gardens or at the markets within a network of businesses owned by the same Chinese businessmen. Market gardens were also sometimes used as a cover for illegal immigrants (e.g. \\"Man deported to Red China after 8 years in Australia\\", The Sydney Morning Herald. 14 April 1962. - he had worked on a market garden 'in Matraville'). Thus running a garden was one way of introducing an increased number of workers under the restrictive immigration laws.Michael Williams, Chinese Settlement in New South Wales p.34 This is possibly the reason for Tiy War and Co leasing one of the lots at the Chinese Market Gardens at La Perouse from the 1920s. Throughout the twentieth century market gardens helped numerous Chinese immigrants to survive and become established in Australia. Randwick - A Social History suggests that the men who worked on the gardens were paid low wages although given board and food. The vegetables were washed in a large central shed, and the men sometimes lived in corrugated iron huts on site, cooking over open fires. They were often up by 4am, off with their vegetables to market. Some also hawked the vegetables on Sydney streets or sold them door-to door. The Chinese gardeners were respected in the area and the image of an \\"Old Chow\\" (as the gardeners were called) was a vivid one for many older residents.Randwick Council, 1985 The market gardens continued to be cultivated throughout the twentieth century, many coming under the control of wealthy Chinese merchants in Dixon and Hay Streets, thus being linked into the wider network of Chinese economic activity in NSW.Randwick, 1985, pp157-159 Most of the market gardens in the north of the Randwick municipality were overtaken by housing by the late nineteenth century, but several of the market gardens in the south near La Perouse survived into more recent times, probably because of their relative isolation and low-lying terrain. By 1961, there were just nine market garden Crown Land leases left in the Randwick municipality, confined to two areas: four in the Wassell Street area and five in the Bunnerong Road area. Now there are just three left on the Bunnerong Road site. During the 1960s Randwick Council made considerable efforts to prevent long-term extensions of these leases by the Crown in order to facilitate the future use of these areas for residential purposes such a public housing. Musecape wrote of the La Perouse cultural landscape in 1997: The relative isolation of La Perouse, at the southern end of Sydney's south eastern suburbs has led to the general area being regarded as one of quarantine - a suitable location for the isolation of society's outcasts: Aboriginal people (at La Perouse), those suffering from infectious diseases (at Prince Henry Hospital), criminals (at Long Bay), the aged (at Bare Island and the Cable Station), the unemployed during the Great Depressions of the 1930s and migrants in the years after World War II. La Perouse accordingly has high levels of social significance as a reminder of past attitudes to disadvantaged groups in the community.Musecape, 1997, p29 [History of interactions with La Perouse Aboriginal community and Hill 60 shanty town to be expanded]. =Present situation= In 2010 the three lots that make up the Chinese Markets Gardens La Perouse had been under continuous cultivation by the same three Chinese families for between 35 and 60 years. However, in 2011 the family elder who farmed Lot 1079 retired and Crown Lands have not advertised for new lessees. Thus in 2012 this lot lies fallow and overgrown. In 2012 the other two lots continue to be cultivated by the Teng and Ha families. With the increase in Asian immigrants since 1990, new vegetables have been introduced to the mainstream Australian diet. \\"When my Dad started on the farm 40 years ago, they grew mostly Australian vegetables such as celery\\" said Gordon Ha. \\"Now with the demand for new vegetables, we are growing Chinese vegetables like Bok Choy, Cho(y) Sum and Chinese broccoli\\".Heritage Branch press release, 1999 To be completed. Shirley Fitzgerald's commissioned review 2012 states: These notes should explore the nature of the terrain (swampy, rocky, distant) and place the longevity of the survival of the market gardens in this context. This section should also recognise the role of these gardens within the overall colonial pattern and distribution of horticulture and with reference to its distribution across the urban area of Sydney. Market gardens were not ex-urban or semi-urban land uses, but integral to the urbanisation process. This was well understood in the 19th century when market gardens were ubiquitous throughout Sydney. Subsequent understanding of market gardening as an urban fringe land use, based on calculations of urban land values became the normal way of theorising them as the 20th century progressed. Increasingly the land use was pushed to the urban fringes until today they are located on primarily in the southwest and north-west of the greater metropolitan area. Currently there is a new paradigm emerging that posits an urban model in which horticulture, gardening and even agriculture are once again becoming integral to the urban condition. This section should also contain something on La Perouse as a microcosm of continuous and sequential land occupation patterns from a pre -colonial Indigenous presence to industrial activities are legible in the landscape.Fitzgerald, 2012 In addition the Heritge Branch suggests that parallel with a rise of \\"Farmers Markets\\", community garden creation and a thirst for \\"local\\" food, knowledge about vegetable and fruit gardening, there is a growing interest in reducing \\"food miles\\" and having locally-grown food, sourced from as close to the end-market as possible. Existing market gardens complement this trend, and could be expected to have high social value to the current community.  Description  The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are located between the cemetery and the school on Bunnerong Road, La Perouse. The site is bounded to the north by the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park (including Botany Cemetery, Crematorium, Memorial and Funeral Home), to the south by Hill 60, to the east by Bunnerong Road and to the west by Bicentennial Park. The three lots comprise an area of around .Lots 1077, 1078 and 1079 DP 752015 Entrance to Lot 1077 is on Bunnerong Road and the entrances to Lots 1078 and 1079 are through the cemetery (which is also owned by Crown Lands). The site is on low-lying land, growing many kinds of vegetables and herbs, including bok choy, shallots, parsley and coriander. The gardens are equipped with a pipe irrigation system. An unnamed creek flows in the middle of the gardens and has been used for irrigation. Another unnamed creek flows between the market gardens and Botany Cemetery. The two creeks meet at the west end of Lot 1079 then flow to Yarra Bay in Botany Bay through a concrete tunnel. They are liable to flood in heavy rain. In each market garden, there is a group of corrugated iron or fibro buildings. The vegetables are washed in a large central shed, and some workers have been seen to be living in the huts. Other sheds are used as storerooms for agricultural machinery, fertilizer and tools. = Condition = As at 19 July 2012, two of the three lots continue to be leased by Chinese families and in these the market gardens function well, providing fresh vegetables on daily basis. The lease for the third lot 1079 nearest Botany Bay lapsed in 2011 when the lessee retired and no new lease has been advertised or appointed. In 2012 it is lying fallow and overgrown. Typically the market gardens suffer damage from hailstorms and flood each year. The physical conditions of the buildings are poor. The buildings on Lot 1079 were damaged in 2012. Traditional cultivation practices appear to have endured and much of the original form of the gardens retained. In 2012 the lease for the third lot 1079 nearest Botany Bay lapsed in 2011 when the lessee retired and now lies fallow and overgrown. The other two lots continue to be leased by Chinese families and in these the market gardens function well, providing fresh vegetables on daily basis. The creek between the market gardens and Botany Cemetery is not always well maintained and the tunnel leading to Yarra Bay is not capable of draining it in heavy rain. Then water pours over the bank and washes vegetables away, leaving rubbish on the site. Sometimes, the sea water pours back to the market garden through the tunnel.  Heritage listing  As at 19 July 2012, the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State significance for their history, associations, research potential, representative value and rarity as a site of the continuous cultivation of food for the Sydney metropolitan area by Chinese market gardeners at least since 1909. Traditional cultivation practices appear to have endured and much of the original form of the gardens retained. Offering a living demonstration of one of the few occupations available to Chinese men in the nineteenth century and during the discriminatory period of the White Australia Policy (between Federation and the 1970s) the gardens are significant for their association with the history of Chinese immigration to Australia and the influence of ethnic communities on local industry. The Chinese Market Gardens are also significant because of historic inter- relations between the Chinese market gardeners and the La Perouse Aboriginal community and the depression era camps at Hill 60, contributing unique insights into the history of marginalised people in Sydney. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are also of State social significance for the esteem with which they are held by the Chinese community in NSW. The gardens are also at least of local significance to the wider community for the role they have played in helping to feed the local and regional population. Although this was particularly valued during the inter-war depression and post-war periods, there has also been a recent growth of interest in sustainable urban agriculture and the value of \\"local\\" food, which adds to the esteem in which they are held. They are also of local aesthetic significance for providing the sight of green, productive open space tended by Asian people within a Sydney suburban landscape. Described as \\"an interesting and charming contrast to its surroundings\\", the gardens bestow a rural ambience through the pleasing form and strong geometric patterns of their cultivated garden beds, the arrangement of their irrigation channels and creeks, their uncluttered views to adjacent open space and their remnant corrugated iron sheds scattered throughout the site. See Reference list for hyperlink to Shirley Fitzgerald's report commissioned by the Heritage Branch in 2012 affirming the State significance of this site. Chinese Market Gardens was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State historical significance as a site of the continuous cultivation of food for the Sydney metropolitan area by Chinese market gardeners at least since 1909. Traditional cultivation practices appear to have endured and much of the original form of the gardens retained. Offering a living demonstration of one of the few occupations available to Chinese men in the nineteenth century and during the discriminatory period of the White Australia Policy (between Federation and the 1970s) the gardens are significant for their association with the history of Chinese immigration to Australia and the influence of ethnic communities on local industry. The site is made more significant as an historic place for growing food by its close proximity (within 2 kilometres) to one of the earliest sites of European food cultivation in Australia - by the French explorer La Perouse who in 1788 planted and briefly tended the 'Frenchmen's Gardens' nearby in Frenchman's Bay. The Chinese Market Gardens are also made more significant because of historic inter-relations between the Chinese market gardeners and the La Perouse Aboriginal community. These connections arose partly through proximity, with the gardens being adjacent to the Aboriginal-owned \\"Hill 60\\" and close to the La Perouse Aboriginal \\"Reserve\\", and partly through shared historic marginalisation from mainstream Australian culture. As Janice Wilton has observed, the \\"ambiguous position Chinese market gardeners held in local communities\\" can be seen to be symbolised by the location of their gardens on the edges of towns - \\"placed on the periphery of white settlement and of European social and working life\\".Wilton, p29 The La Perouse gardens demonstrate this aspect of Australian history in their location which in 1900 was remote from the city centre, and in their historic connections to Sydney's indigenous population and to the unemployed who lived in the adjacent shanty town located on Hill 60 during the 1930s depression and afterwards. Thus the history and location of these gardens contributes unique insights into the history of marginalised people in Sydney. Within the statewide story these gardens contribute to our understanding of Chinese settlement patterns and Chinese cultural practices in the period of dwindling Chinese population following the introduction of the White Australia policy in 1901. The area from Botany Road to the coast and from Matraville south to La Perouse has a long association with the \\"outsider\\" elements of European society dating from the late nineteenth century, with land uses that included the Indigenous settlement at La Perouse, the gaol at Long Bay, the Coast (infectious diseases) Hospital at Little Bay and a leprosarium. The area hosted the unemployed in makeshift camps during the Great Depression and welcomed the Chinese who were engaged in the peripheral urban occupations of fishing and gardening. Today the intensity of Chinese occupation has all but disappeared, but the remaining market gardens, along with the remnant cemetery once attached to the infectious diseases hospital where many Chinese who contracted smallpox in the 1880s were buried (because their bones were prohibited from being repatriated to China by law), and the vibrant and active temple in Retreat Street, Alexandria (built by the clan associations of the market gardening fraternity) all work together to create a legible imprint of Australia's oldest Chinese community in the landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Chinese Market Gardens are of State significance for their associations with Sydney's Chinese community. Long established Chinese organisations have looked after the market gardeners with financial assistance, accommodation and other social welfare. Harry Ha of Tiy War & Co (named as sub-lessor of Portion 1077 as early as 1922) was a principal in the Yiu Ming Tong, the association that ran the Chinese temple at Alexandria, and President of the Gardeners Association. The temple retains records of his involvement in the Go Yiu community to which most market gardeners belonged, and which was involved in repatriation of bones to China. Further research may demonstrate local significance associated with some of the gardens' European operators. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of local aesthetic significance for providing the sight of green, productive open space tended by Asian people within a Sydney suburban landscape. Described as \\"an interesting and charming contrast to its surroundings\\",National Trust letter to Randwick Council, 8.12.1979 the gardens bestow a rural ambience through their pleasing form and strong geometric patterns of the cultivated garden beds, their arrangement of the irrigation channels and the creek, their uncluttered views to adjacent open space and their remnant corrugated iron sheds scattered throughout the site. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State social significance for the esteem with which they are held by the Chinese community in NSW. For many people, especially those from the Yiu Ming district of Guandong, working in market gardens was their starting point in Australia. They worked hard and then moved on to open restaurants, grocery shops and their own businesses. The State Heritage Register listing of the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse was one of several listings resulting from a 1999 Heritage Branch program which consulted with the Chinese community to nominate sites they considered to be of heritage significance. Submissions in 2012 from representatives of the Chinese Heritage Association of Australia and the Chinese Australian Historical Society suggested that the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are considered to be gaining in significance as their rarity within the Sydney metropolitan area increases. The gardens are of at least local significance to the wider community for the role they have played in helping to feed the local and regional population. Although this was particularly valued during the inter-war depression and post-war periods, there has also been a recent growth of interest in sustainable urban agriculture and the value of \\"local\\" food, demonstrated by the rise of community garden creation, \\"Farmers\\" Markets' and courses in learning skills required to grow local food. As early as 1979, Randwick residents, in the name of the Perouse Citizens' Advancement Committee, launched a campaign to oppose residential redevelopment and require the State government to conserve the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse in their historic usage. Their submission included a petition with over a thousand signatures. A more recent petition, organised in 2012 by an official of the Chinese Australian Historical Society, gathered 783 signatures in support of the conservation of the gardens, demonstrating that these market gardens have a long and continuing social significance for the wider community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State heritage significance for their research potential to illuminate our understandings of Chinese agricultural practices as they have been imported and applied in NSW. In 1999 the work done in the gardens was still by manual labour with simple tools, with just one tractor and one rotary hoe used in each lot. The technical significance of agricultural technology and associated social relations in these market gardens remains to be determined by further detailed research, especially of the extant building structures on the site. There is also archaeological potential to learn about traditional Aboriginal cultural use of the land before colonisation and its transformation from Indigenous occupation to a place adapted to provide food for the European colony. Filling of the swamp may have served to protect pre-contact archaeological remains. There may also be remnants of activity associated with the mid twentieth century depression camp on the adjacent Hill 60. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State significance for their rarity in demonstrating a continuous pattern of usage of cultivation by Chinese market gardeners from the early twentieth century through to the present. Whereas market gardens were found in every settled locality in NSW throughout the 19th century, since World War II they have been gradually edged out of the metropolitan area. In 2009 a comparative study found that the Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse were one of just five market gardens left in Sydney (the others were Occupation Road Market Gardens (Rockdale LGA), West Botany Street Market Gardens (Rockdale LGA), Toomevara Lane Market Gardens (Rockdale LGA) and Wassell Street Market Gardens (Randwick LGA), according to Rappoport, 2009). At a local level the site is rare as one of just two traditional market gardens remaining in the Randwick LGA. By the 1950s the numbers of resident Chinese in NSW had dwindled to the point where many of the gardens were being taken over by southern European immigrants, typically the Italians and Maltese. The end of the White Australia policy in the 1970s and the increase in Asian migration since then has seen the re-entry of Asians into the occupation. The continuous occupation of the leasehold by Chinese lessees at these gardens is particularly rare in this context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Chinese Market Gardens La Perouse are of State significance as a fine representative example of market gardens in NSW which have remained largely intact over time. Early colonial efforts at supplying food to the Sydney settlement included tillage at Farm Cove, in Woolloomooloo, at the head of Darling Harbour and near the present Central Station, while parts of Chippendale were given over to potatoes and hosted the colony's first nursery and early vineyards. As settlement spread market gardens were located in every suburb where the soil was adequate to support them. In the nineteenth century on any afternoon stroll anyone living in any urban area of Sydney, including the city proper, could experience the sight of a market garden.

After that achievement, Munger started and ran some of the largest gin manufacturing companies in the United States. He also developed properties in Dallas, Texas later designated as National Historic Places. Finally, he was a philanthropist who supported numerous causes in the Birmingham, Alabama area.  Early life  Robert Sylvester Munger was born in Rutersville, Texas on July 24, 1854. His father, Henry Martin Munger, ran a sawmill and cotton gin there, and his boyhood included working in those enterprises. Robert later studied Latin and Law at Trinity University in Tehuacana, Texas. However his studies were interrupted when his father called him back home to run the cotton gin.  System cotton gin  For a decade and a half after 1865 the end of the Civil War, a number of innovative features became widely used for ginning in the United States. They included steam power instead of animal power, an automatic feeder to assure that the gin stand ran smoothly, a condenser to make the clean cotton coming out of the gin easier to handle, and indoor presses so that cotton no longer had to be carried across the gin yard to be baled. Then, in 1879, while he was running his father's gin in Rutersville, Robert Munger invented additional system ginning techniques. Robert and his wife, Mary Collett, later moved to Mexia, Texas, built a system gin, and obtained related patents. The Munger System Ginning Outfit (or system gin) integrated all the ginning operation machinery, thus assuring the cotton would flow through the machines smoothly. Such system gins use air to move cotton from machine to machine. Robert's motivation for his inventions included improving employee working conditions in the gin. However, the selling point for most gin owners was the accompanying cost savings while producing cotton both more speedily and of higher quality. By the 1960s, many other advances had been made in ginning machinery, but the manner in which cotton flowed through the gin machinery continued to be the Munger system. Economic Historian William H. Phillips referred to the development of system ginning as \\"The Munger Revolution\\" in cotton ginning. He wrote, > [The Munger] innovations were the culmination of what geographer Charles S. > Aiken has termed the\\"second ginning revolution\\", in which the privately > owned plantation gins were replaced by large-scale public ginneries. This > revolution, in turn, led to a major restructuring of the cotton gin > industry, as the small, scattered gin factories and shops of the nineteenth > century gave way to a dwindling number of large twentieth-century > corporations designing and constructing entire ginning operations. = Gin manufacturing = Munger approached several gin manufacturers, but they were not interested in making his system gin. As a result, in 1884, the family moved to Dallas, where the Mungers built their own factory. In 1887, other investors joined them under the name Munger Improved Cotton Machine Manufacturing Company. The Munger children, as well as Munger's brother Ennis, served as executives. The company's sales increased rapidly west of the Mississippi River. In 1890, Munger moved to Birmingham, Alabama to build a factory there to avoid freight charges to the east and to meet increasing demand. Munger's brother, Stephen, stayed behind as president of the Dallas operation. With additional investors, the Birmingham factory became the Northington-Munger-Pratt Company, which became the largest producer of cotton ginning machinery east of the Mississippi. In 1899, the Mungers' companies merged with several of the other large U.S. gin manufacturers. Initially, Robert and Stephen were vice-presidents of the newly formed Continental Gin Company in Birmingham. The company continued to be a major gin manufacturer, and various Mungers held a large portion of the company's executive positions for the next quarter-century. The Munger family's substantial involvement ended in 1926, two years after the death of Robert and Mary Collett. At that point, a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff of Atlanta bought a controlling interest in Continental Gin. One of Munger's sons, Eugene, stayed on in executive roles at least until 1939. = Surviving examples = Few early system cotton gins survive. An 2004 assessment of an example in Louisiana identified the following such gins, noting some have been restored to working condition: * Georgia Museum of Agriculture & Historic Village, Tifton Georgia * Old Alabama Town, Montgomery Alabama * Burton Farmers Gin, Texas Cotton Gin Museum, Burton Texas * Louisiana State Cotton Museum, Lake Providence, Louisiana Magnolia Plantation, Louisiana has a gin with circa 1900 system ginning equipment. An assessment in 2004 found the gin is secure in its present situation owned by the National Park Service. However, making it accessible to the public would require undoing some twentieth-century modifications to the building. One of the few examples of a Munger gin left in existence is the Piazza Gin on display at Frogmore Plantation in Louisiana.  Real estate  In the early 1900s, Munger conceived and promoted Munger Place in Dallas Texas, recognized today by the National Register of Historic Places as the largest collection of Prairie-style homes in America. Portions of this fifty-block neighborhood in East Dallas were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Swiss Avenue Historic District in 1974 and as Munger Place Historic District in 1978.  Philanthropy  In his later years, Birmingham newspapers recognized the Mungers' extensive philanthropies. A newspaper article at the time of his death listed several institutions they supported substantially: Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern College, Highlands Methodist Church, Walker Memorial Church, and the Birmingham and Houston YMCAs. The article also emphasized the Mungers' contributions to African-American institutions: Central Alabama College, Miles Memorial College, and various Birmingham churches. The article reported: \\"There isn't a negro church in Birmingham to which he has not contributed.\\" It also mentioned donations to \\"the suffering people of Europe.\\" The Mungers also supported several universities, such as Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  Later life  Munger married Mary Collett of Fairfield, Texas, the daughter of Captain James Hamilton Collett of North Carolina and Margaret Ann Davis of Alabama, in 1878. Robert and Mary Collett had nine children, eight of whom lived into adulthood. Munger and Mary Collett moved to Birmingham and into the Mirabeau Swanson House in the Five Points South neighborhood in 1889. In 1902, the family moved again, now outside of town to Arlington, an antebellum home that briefly had housed the headquarters of Union General James H. Wilson late in the Civil War. Munger believed in the importance of exercise for all, among other things teaching his children to ride bicycles at very young ages. Munger's fascination with wheels for transportation attracted him to automobiles when autos began replacing the horse and buggy. The family purchased its first automobile soon after moving to Birmingham and often traveled by car. They bought a Winton in 1902, followed by 14hp and 24hp Packards, and a 1903 Winton. In 1904, Munger acquired a Panhard-Levassor in London and used it to help pioneer United States automotive travel. His personal day books record many adventuresome auto trips at home and abroad. After playing 18 holes of golf on April 7, 1923, Munger became ill with pneumonia and died 13 days later. He died on April 20, 1923.  Other  Historian Dr. Carolyn Green Satterfield included three chapters on the Munger family in Arlington, Birmingham's Historic House, which she edited for The Arlington Historical Association in 2010. In September 2018, Munger was inducted into the Alabama Men's Hall of Fame. The Alabama Men's Hall of Fame was established by an act of the Alabama state legislature in 1987 to parallel the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame. Its mission is \\"to recognize those men native to or identified most closely with the State of Alabama who have made significant contributions on a state, national, or international scale within their professional field.\\"  References   External links  * Talk given by Edward Lee Norton, his secretary, on July 19, 1950, on his life. * Free 96 page PDF Book published 1890 about the Munger system of ginning, from the Library of Congress * Scans of newspaper articles and advertisements from a Dallas review in 2018 of Munger's early days in Dallas 1854 births 1923 deaths 19th-century American inventors 20th- century American inventors Trinity University (Texas) alumni American businesspeople American philanthropists American real estate businesspeople ","title":"Robert S.

Biography  Tretyakov was born in 1953. His father left the family before his birth, and Vladimir grew up with his alcoholic mother, who often beat him. His grandmother managed to get him up to a general education, leaving to study in Tashkent. Since then he has hated drinking and women. After school, Vladimir joined the army, then graduated from a vocational school. For several years he lived in Kemerovo Oblast, where he learned to cut up cattle, which prove useful later on. After returning from the army he married, and began work as a railway repairman. Tretyakov also began to argue with his wife because of the fact that she, according to Tretyakov, drank too much. At some point, his wife, tired from all this, kicked Vladimir out of the apartment. In the mid-1970s, Tretyakov worked as a railroad engineer in Arkhangelsk, was an udarnik, a member of the Voluntary People's Druzhina, and more than once detained hooligans and alcoholics. As an excellent worker, in 1977 he received a separate apartment in one of the new buildings in Arkhangelsk. He also met with Angelina Koroleva, with whom he had a serious relationship. Soon, Vladimir became annoyed that the woman often consumed alcohol. On these grounds, the pair often quarreled, eventually leading up to the maniac's first murder. On December 9, 1977, after returning to his apartment and seeing Koroleva in a drunken state, Tretyakov strangled her. Realizing she had died, he used a knife and axe to dismember her corpse, put it in a backpack, and then disposed of the remains in a vacant lot near the train station in Arkhangelsk at night. Tretyakov decided to fight female drunkenness and began to kill women whom he saw on the streets in a drunken state. On December 13, he murdered a woman named Petrova in her apartment. All of the subsequent murders he committed had the same modus operandi. In addition to the two above, in December 1997 Tretyakov killed and dismembered two more women (Anna Popova and Ekaterina Marchenko). He killed another one, Maria Gerasimova, on January 13, 1978. Panic ensued in Arkhangelsk. There were rumors that the maniac sold meat from the victims on the market, but during the investigation no such thing could be confirmed. The radio broadcast \\"Voice of America\\" reported that cases of cannibalism were noted in the city. On January 25, Tretyakov killed two girls (Inna Ignakhina and Sveta Eremeeva), who were invited to his home and offered a drink. In his own words, = Arrest, trial and sentence = After killing and dismembering the girls, Tretyakov left the bodies lying on the balcony of his apartment. The neighbors soon reported the disappearance of his girlfriend. The head of the criminal investigation department Donat Popov, who conducted the investigation, went alone to him. When he was offered to go to the police station, Tretyakov decided to kill the policeman in the elevator. Popov realised this, and lied to Tretyakov that several colleagues had come with him. Tretyakov was taken to the police and questioned about Koroleva's disappearance, explaining that she had drank and then disappeared. His apartment was searched, and according to those who searched it, During the interrogations, Tretyakov soon confessed to the seven victims, then showed the authorities all the burial places which had not been discovered. Tretyakov's investigative experiments, fearing revenge from the Arkhangelsk residents, were carried under heavy guard with dogs. He was recognized as sane. On August 11, 1978, the Arkhangelsk Regional Court sentenced Vladimir Tretyakov to death. The convict tried to appeal the verdict, referring to his hard childhood and useful work as an udarnik. However, the Supreme Court of Russia left the verdict unchanged, stating:On August 19, 1979, Vladimir Tretyakov was executed by firing squad.

Physician-assisted suicide is medical assistance in helping another person end their own life for the purpose of relieving their suffering, and voluntary euthanasia is the act of ending the life of another, also for the purpose of relieving their suffering. The phrase \\"assisted dying\\" is often used instead of physician-assisted suicide by proponents of legalisation and the media when used in the context of a medically assisted suicide for the purpose of relieving suffering. \\"Assisted dying\\" is also the phrase used by politicians when bills are proposed in parliament. England and Wales Section 2 of the Suicide Act 1961, as originally enacted, provided that it was an offence to \\"aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another\\" and that a person who committed this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. That section has been amended by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Approximately 46 Britons a year go abroad to Dignitas in Switzerland for a physician-assisted suicide. No family member has been convicted of helping them although some have been charged and have had to wait before hearing the charges have been dropped. Because of the inconsistencies between the law and prosecution Debbie Purdy launched a case to clarify whether or not her husband would risk being prosecuted if he helped her travel to a Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to die. Purdy's case ended on 30 August 2009 with the decision that the Director of Public Prosecutions had to clarify how the Suicide Act 1961 is to be enforced in England and Wales. The DPP issued guidelines in February 2010 setting out situations where a prosecution was not in the public interest, and therefore unlikely to happen. Two factors which point towards a prosecution not being in the public interest are that the victim had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to commit suicide; and that the suspect was wholly motivated by compassion. =Attempts at reform= There have been various attempts to introduce legislation to change the legal situation regarding physician-assisted suicide in the United Kingdom. In 1931 Dr C. Killick Millard, the President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, proposed a Voluntary Euthanasia (Legislation) Bill for incurable invalids.Daily Mirror 17 October 1931, p2 \\"Doctor's Plea for the Right to Easy Death\\" In 1935, Lord Moynihan and Dr Killick Millard founded the British Voluntary Euthanasia Society (later known as EXIT and now as Dignity in Dying). The first attempt to reform the law in England was in 1936 by Lord Arthur Ponsonby and supported by the Euthanasia Society. The British Voluntary Euthanasia Society produced A Guide To Self Deliverance giving guidelines on how a person should commit suicide. Publication was delayed amid controversy because of the Suicide Act of 1961 which states that the legal system can allow up to 14 years in prison for anyone that assists in a suicide. Therefore, it was unclear whether the Society could be held accountable for assisting in suicide because of its publication. In 1969, a Bill was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Raglan. In 1970, the House of Commons debated the issue. Baroness Wootton introduced a Bill to the Lords in 1976 on the matter of \\"passive euthanasia\\".Foreword by the Earl of Listowel to Voluntary Euthanasia: Experts Debate the Right to Die eds. A. B. Downing and Barbara Smoker, , p. 5 On 10 December 1997, a vote was taken in the House of Commons on the issue of introducing a Doctor Assisted Dying Bill, proposed by Labour MP Joe Ashton. The bill was defeated by 234 votes to 89. Between 2003 and 2006, Labour peer Lord Joffe made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalized physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia - all were rejected by Parliament. In June 2012, the British Medical Journal published an editorial arguing that medical organisations like the British Medical Association ought to drop their opposition to assisted dying and take a neutral stance so as to enable Parliament to debate the issue and not have what Raymond Tallis described as a \\"disproportionate influence on the decision\\". In 2014, Labour peer Lord Falconer introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into the House of Lords. The bill proposed that terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of less than six months be given the option of a medically assisted death, subject to legal safeguards. The bill reached committee stage before running out of time in the session. In 2015, Labour MP Rob Marris introduced an Assisted Dying Bill based on Lord Falconer's proposals the year before. The bill was defeated by 118 votes to 330 on 11 September 2015. In 2016, Conservative peer Lord Hayward reintroduced the Assisted Dying Bill into the Lords. The bill did not get past the first reading due to the parliamentary session ending. Scotland Assisted dying in Scots law might constitute murder, culpable homicide or no offence depending on the nature of the assistance. In 1980, the Scottish branch of the British Voluntary Euthanasia Society (now called Exit) broke off from its original society in order to publish How to Die with Dignity, which became the first publication of its kind in the world. In a 2012 consultation on the Member's Bill proposed by MSP Margo MacDonald, 64% of the members of the public who choose to give comment on the issue rejected the proposals. A similar consultation by the Health and Sport Committee in 2014 came to a different conclusion, with 78% of responses by individuals being supportive of the proposals. Nevertheless, in 2015 a majority of MSPs including the first minister Alex Salmond voted against the bill in the Scottish Parliament, defeating it in its first stage. In February 2019 a group of MSPs, including previous opponent Kezia Dugdale, formed to attempt to reform assisted dying law in the Scottish Parliament.  Northern Ireland  Since health is a devolved matter in the United Kingdom, it would be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for assisted dying as and when it sees fit. To date, no such bills have been tabled there. Crown dependencies and overseas territories =Jersey= In October 2018, in response to a petition, Jersey's Health Minister called on the laws banning assisted dying to be reviewed. =Guernsey= In May 2018, a vote was taken on the issue in Guernsey. The proposals would have allowed those with six months or less to live access to assisted dying. The vote was lost. =Falkland Islands= In July 2018 the Falkland Islands voted, in principle, to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill, subject to safeguards. They are the first British overseas territory to do so. In addition they voted to consider changing the law on assisted dying if the UK did the same. Whilst the vote did not change the law, campaigners saw it as a vote of support for legalisation in the UK. Legal challenges There have been multiple challenges to the blanket ban on assisted suicide by people wanting a physician-assisted suicide, both by patients with and without a terminal illness. In 2001, motor neurone disease sufferer Diane Pretty took her case to the House of Lords, for the right to allow her husband to assist legally in her suicide. The case was dismissed by them, and also subsequently by the European Court of Human Rights in 2002. In 2008, multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy took her case to the House of Lords for clarification on whether her husband would face prosecution on returning from Switzerland, should he help her to travel there for an assisted death. She won, and the Director of Public Prosecutions clarified the likelihood of prosecution in this instance in 2009. In 2012 a man with locked- in syndrome, Tony Nicklinson, applied to the High Court for the right for a medically assisted death. His case was rejected and he decided to end his life via starvation shortly afterwards. His wife ultimately took his case to the Supreme Court, in R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice, where it was rejected in 2014. The judges did rule however that they have the authority to declare the parliamentary blanket ban on assisted suicide to be incompatible with human rights law. In 2014, the Director of Public Prosecutions further clarified the likelihood of prosecution against medical professionals. Previously, they were more likely to face assisted suicide prosecution due to their role as care givers. The DPP clarified that only those medical professionals directly involved in providing care to the concerned patient would be more likely to face prosecution. It was said that the clarification was made at the request of the Supreme Court. In 2015, the clarification was subsequently challenged in the High Court, where it was argued that the DPP was making laws as opposed to applying them. The High Court rejected the challenge against the DPP's clarifications, and the Court of Appeal subsequently denied a request to challenge the High Court's decision. In 2017, retired lecturer Noel Conway brought his case to the High Court for the right for a medically assisted death. He has motor neurone disease and is terminally ill. His case was dismissed by the High Court, by the Court of Appeal in 2018, and ultimately by the Supreme Court at the end of 2018. Also in 2017, a man known as \\"Omid T\\" with multiple system atrophy brought a case to the High Court for the right to a medically assisted death. His case is different from Noel Conway's in that he is not terminally ill. His case is currently in progress. In October 2018 Omid ended his life in Switzerland. In May 2019, a man who became paralysed in a car accident and now lives with excruciating pain, Paul Lamb, began legal proceedings to seek a peaceful death. His case is supported by Humanists UK. Opinion polls A 2015 Populus poll found broad public support for the introduction of assisted dying laws in the United Kingdom. 82% of people supported it, including 86% of people with disabilities. Another poll showed that 54% of British General Practitioners are either supportive or neutral towards the introduction of assisted dying laws. A similar 2017 poll on Doctors.net.uk published in the BMJ said that 55% of doctors would support it. In contrast the BMA, which represents doctors in the UK, opposes it, although from June 2005 to June 2006 they took a neutral position.

In 2014, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and wants the right to an assisted death. All forms of assisted suicide are currently illegal in the United Kingdom, and doctors found to be assisting a suicide can be jailed for up to 14 years, under the Suicide Act 1961. Mr Conway challenged this law in the High Court in 2017 on the grounds of human rights, claiming that the law against physician-assisted suicide in the United Kingdom interferes with his \\"right to respect for private and family life\\", protected under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. His case was supported by Dignity in Dying. On 5 October 2017 the High Court ruled against him.R (Conway) v Secretary of State for Justice [2017] EWHC 2447 (Admin), available at http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/2447.html. Retrieved 25 February 2019. Mr Conway subsequently took his case to the Court of Appeal, which was heard in May 2018. Three judges rejected his case on 27 June 2018. The court stated that Parliament is better placed to rule on the issue and concerns were raised over whether the safeguards proposed by Mr Conway were adequate to protect vulnerable people.R (Conway) v Secretary of State for Justice [2018] EWCA Civ 1431, available at: http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/1431.html. Retrieved 25 February 2019. Following the decision in the Court of Appeal, Mr Conway announced his intention to take his case to the Supreme Court. This was the first time since 2014 the Supreme Court has considered a case of assisted dying, when they reviewed the case of Tony Nicklinson posthumously. Although Mr Nicklinson's case was ultimately rejected, some statements by the Justices were seen as positive by assisted dying campaigners. However, on 27 November 2018 the Supreme Court rejected the possibility of a full hearing for Mr Conway's case.R (Conway) v Secretary of State for Justice (27 November 2018) available at: https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/r-on-the-application-of-conway-v- secretary-of-state-for-justice-court-order.pdf.

Life and career She was born on 24 November 1908 in Staryi Sambir (Polish: Stary Sambor) in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In the years 1929‚Äì1935, she studied sculpture at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w, under supervision of Xawery Dunikowski. In 1930, she co-founded the avant-garde, radical left Krak√≥w Group. Before the outbreak of World War II, she mostly dealt with sculpture but after the war she focused on painting. Her works were mainly abstract paintings. Since 1951, she created monotypes. Using this printmaking technique and sometimes combining it with oil paints and distemper, she created her most famous cycles of paintings ‚Äì Penetracje (Penetrations) and Rytmy (Rhythms). Her works show a great fascination with the human shape and its place in space as well as the depiction of movement in painting. Balancing between figurative displays and abstract signs is also a distinctive feature of her paintings. She was one of the founders of the avant-garde theatre Cricot (1933‚Äì1938) alongside J√≥zef Jarema, Henryk Gotlib and Zbigniew Pronaszko. She is also known for her artistic collaboration with Tadeusz Kantor and his experimental theatre Cricot 2 as well as Adam Polewka's puppet theatre. Her paintings have been exhibited in a number of museums in Poland including the Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art. In 2018, her painting Formy (Forms) was sold at an auction for over 1 million zloty (ca. $270,000), which made it the most expensive painting by a female artist sold in Poland at the time. In 2019, Agnieszka Dauksza published a Nike Award-nominated book Jaremianka. Biografia focusing on the life of Jarema and her artisitc legacy.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 08 November 2011.  History  Floodwaters surrounding the Post Office, 17 January 1910 The first pastoral activities in the area occurred in the 1830s, with a town forming in the late 1840s. A hotel was licensed in 1858 and the town was proclaimed in 1860. The first post office and police station were established but a major flood devastated the township in 1864. A court house was also constructed in the 1860s, but after the Robertson Land Act of 1861 the area was slowly opened up to smaller selectors and wheat-growing began in 1873. The railway arrived in the district in 1882 and generated further settlement. The Narrabri Post Office was constructed, with quarters, by FA King in 1888 to a design by the New South Wales Colonial Architect's office, under James Barnet.Warmington and Ward 1990 The post office was flooded in January 1910. In the original four- arched design was extended to six arches.  Description  Narrabri Post Office is at 138-140 Maitland Street, corner Doyle Street, Narrabri, comprising the whole of Lot 21 DP775501. The Narrabri Post Office is a single storey brick building with a timber floor and corrugated iron roof. The original building is on a corner site at the intersection of Maitland and Doyle Streets, in the main shopping precinct. James Barnet was architect for the four-arched 1888 design. It incorporates an L-shaped quarters juxtaposed behind the arcaded front to Maitland Street, and two parallel wings running back across the site to the rear and the later Telephone Exchange. The arcaded front originally comprised four arches, with the c.1914 addition adding two more. The arcaded front was originally a verandah but now, in its filled-in form, comprises the main public hall, the entry porch and an enclosed return loggia housing the PO boxes. The block immediately behind housed the post office and part of the quarters originally, to judge from their expression in the roof plan. This now houses the back office, clerical area and loading bay. It has a timber-framed roof constructed in hipped gables, clad in corrugated galvanised iron, supported on a cornice with intermittent bracketing in pairs, and punctuated by a chimney at the Doyle Street end. There are three other chimneys remaining above the lunch room, postmaster's office and rear toilets area. The chimneys are corniced and in exposed face brick, and the roofs' gabled hips have small lunette ventilators. The arcade front formed a panel in face brick and stucco to Maitland Street. The loggia was topped by a stucco- rendered entablature bearing the name Narrabri Post Office, in the manner of Barnet's other larger post offices of the time, the arch keystones rise up to support the entablature immediately overhead. The arches themselves are dressed in robust stucco archivolts and spring from a set of astylar brick piers. A date plaque in stucco with scalloped corners and the inscription 1888 sits between the second and third arches. The four inset sash windows form arched openings within each arch, one of Greenway's signatures and carried through in a similar way, with a tuck pointed and differently coloured arch over the window inside each arch screen. The north side, facing Doyle Street, is plainly surfaced in face brick with rectangular windows, plain-paned in the lower sash and multi-paned in the upper, each with a dressed sill in stone and overpainted. The quarters' elevation to Maitland Street is linked to the post office loggia by a timber framed porch which leads into the current retail area via a single leaf door, and into the former postmaster's office by another. In its present form this was probably added later, around 1900. The quarters are expressed with a hipped roof component held clear of the main post office mass, with a corniced chimney in exposed face brick at each end of its ridge. The west front of these quarters presented one segmentally arched double-hung sash window to Maitland Street, above a short and hefty sill on two brackets. A timber-framed verandah, hipped and with square-sectioned, quasi-Tuscan posts on pedestal-bases, faces south onto a side yard. For these purposes the 1888 and c.1914 components are regarded as the original building. Parts of the quarters' verandah were later walled in with glazing and weatherboard aprons, which now seems to have been removed. A diagonal-latticed screen was added to the verandah at its west end and screened occupants from Maitland Street. This screen runs partway across the first south-facing bay of the verandah and creates an irregular post rhythm. A pitched and gable-roofed wing runs back along Doyle Street, probably also an addition, and a central wing with a self-contained hipped roof projects from the rear centre of the post office building, again running eastward. This is connected to the main post office roofing with a flat roof porch area described in Dawson's roof plan as \\"modern infill\\". A group of public telephones were placed along Doyle Street, but these are no longer in evidence. At the back of the block on the Doyle Street boundary, there is a generator room in front of the microwave tower. At the rear of the post office lunch room there is a bicycle shed. These were all evidently added much later. Where the microwave tower now stands, in the former back yard, were two more outbuildings, a power and battery room building and a second building, probably for storage. These have since been demolished. A larger telephone exchange building was added, probably in the late 1960s. This presumably replaced earlier telephone exchange facilities. Architecturally this does not relate to the earlier Post Office buildings, being crowned with a massively proportioned box-framed metal roof and fascia, with aluminium-framed windows and finished in smooth faced cream bricks. The exchange is basically a simple cube in form, indented on the north side with a path and entry steps space and a water tank area. This is now separated from the Post Office by a chain-link fence and in part by a rolled top mesh fence around the Post Office's rear wing. The post office was generally refurbished, probably in the 1980s and again in 2002, as part of its conversion to Australia Post retail outlet format. The 2002 plan shows a simple oblong retail area with a counter running the entire length of one side, and a mail room, postmen's area and clerical area in an open-plan back office. The present bicycle storage area has been moved into part of the rear central wing, and lunch and contractors' rooms had been fitted up there as well. The former main wing of the quarters has been converted into toilets, a locker room, a store room and a postmaster's office, generally used as another store room. The ramp has been discreetly slipped into the screened area at the west end of the verandah, and leads through a single leaf door to the merchandising area. The original ceilings and cornices are retained in the public areas. Over the former loggia area the ceiling is a flat board-lined ceiling. The ceiling then rises much higher over the main public space and beyond, with fibre or plasterboard linings, the original ceiling rose ventilators. The cornices are curved metal, probably corrugated galvanised and painted iron. = Condition = Faithful upgrading of the interior. Exterior and surrounds which include a picket fence have commenced. The building is generally in sound condition. Externally and internally the buildings ability to demonstrate key aspects of the original (and later extended) James Barnet design is good, with generally minor alterations at the front including signage and ramped access. The front and side elevations are generally as designed. Internally the plan form of the building retains most aspects of the original design. Alterations relating to the merchandising area has utilised low framed walls that could be removed and which can be clearly seen as alterations. These generally do not detract from the original retained internal finishes, especially the ceiling. = Timeline = 1888 (additions), 1895 (repairs), 1914 (additions)  Heritage listing  The significant components of Narrabri Post Office include main postal building and quarters wing comprising fabric dating from 1888 through c.1914 (the latter includes additions). Narrabri Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 08 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Narrabri Post office, constructed in 1888, is an important building within the main street of Narrabri. The original smaller post office with a four arch loggia was designed by James Barnet; the loggia was later sympathetically extended to six arches. The post office is indicative of Narrabri's status as an important township during the late nineteenth century, for which it provided postal communications and services at the centre of an expanding region. The significant components of Narrabri Post Office include main postal building and quarters wing comprising fabric dating from 1888 through c.1914 (the latter includes additions). Criterion D: Characteristic values Narrabri Post Office is an example of: * Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * Victorian arcade-fronted post offices * the work of Colonial Architect, James Barnet. Typologically, the Narrabri Post Office is an example of a second generation building with post and telegraph and quarters. The building was originally designed as a smaller post office with a four arch loggia to the street elevation, but in 1888 the street frontage was extended to a six arch loggia. These alterations were designed by James Barnet in the same style as the original building. Internally, the original plan form of the post office has been altered, but it is unusual in its location of the quarters on the ground level and not an upper level. Stylistically and architecturally, Narrabri Post Office embodies Barnet at a turning point in his design of regional buildings, and early in the development of types and details that kept returning in later years. It is an important example of Barnet's single- storey arcade-fronted post offices, which later became a recurrent genre in his designs, and also introduced Barnet's use of concentric arches in post office design. Other post offices in this arcaded face-brick genre all had their quarters directly overhead, which arguably gave them more presence. Narrabri, however, is no less interesting, being an early move on Barnet's part to express a quarters in direct juxtaposition with a public component on the same floor level. Further, the early additions to the street frontage of the building were designed by Barnet in the same style as the original building, effectively stretching (and emphasising) the original design.

It was built during 1879 by Simeon Pearce. It is also known as Kilkerran and Felton. The property is owned by Randwick City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s, the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 the Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru- ora-dial\\" (City of Sydney webpage, 2003). By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21-year-old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988 Randwick was...slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Sandgate= Sandgate, at 128 Belmore Road, was built around 1870 by Simeon Pearce as part of a row of investment properties along Belmore Road. The first tenant was Edwin T. Penfold, a friend of Pearce. Simeon Pearce was a prominent Randwick citizen, civil servant and successful land speculator. He was born on 27 January 1821 at Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. He and his cousin Samuel arrived as bounty immigrants in Sydney on Christmas Day 1841 aboard the Lady Clarke. By 1854 he had bought of land at both Manly and French's Forest, and over in parcels around Randwick and the St George area which were subdivided and sold profitably after the promotion of Randwick as a fashionable residential area. He was a leading campaigner for the incorporation of Randwick and was its Mayor in 1859 and held this position a total of six times. It was known as Kilkerran when occupied by James Cullen, an importer, in 1885 and later by Henry Hinton, wine merchant who lived there from 1886 to 1890. In 1903 Timothy Fahey took up residence and renamed the house 'Felton.' In 1918 it was acquired by the Australian Government and together with the house next door, it became the \\"Woodville Red Cross Home\\", a facility for World War I veterans. In 1928 Sandgate passed into the hands of Catherine and Harold Tippler. The Tipplers owned the house until September 1966 when it changed ownership three times within a week. In the late 1970s ownership of Sandgate was transferred to the developers of the neighbouring Coles New World Supermarket. In October 1978 the Heritage Branch received respresentations from the Randwick and District Historical Society concerned about proposals to develop a shopping centre on land at the corner of Belmore Road and High Street Randwick. The proposal involved the demolition of Sandgate. As a result, a Section 130 order was placed over Sandgate on 3 November 1978. On 8 November the owner of Sandgate gave notice of its proposed demolition. Negotiations between the owner and the Heritage Branch resulted in an acceptable re-design of the proposed shopping centre that retained the building in situ. An Interim Heritage Order was placed over Sandgate on 15 December 1978. On 13 March 1981 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property. As a condition of consent associated with the development of the neighbouring Randwick Plaza, Sandgate was transferred to Randwick Council in 1982. During the 1980s the building was restored and in September 1987 the then mayor of Randwick, Ald. John Scullion presented the keys of the cottage to Randwick Historical Society's president Mrs Kate Schlink. It was leased to the Randwick and District Historical Society, becoming its museum and heritage centre from 1987 until 1992 when Randwick Council commenced leasing it to commercial interests. On 2 April 1999 Sandgate was transferred to the State Heritage Register.Randwick and District Heritage SocietyHeritage Branch files  Description  Sandgate is a substantial two storey residence. It retains its original character and detailing including elaborate wrought iron verandahs and columns, ornate plaster cornices and friezes and full cedar joinery.

The Turkmen capital Ashgabat is only 15 miles north of this boundary, and Mashhad (Iran‚Äôs second largest city) is 47 miles south of it. Map of the Iran-Soviet Union border; the entire eastern section now forms the Iran-Turkmenistan border Description The border starts at the Caspian coast just to the south of the Turkmen town of Esenguly. It then goes overland in an eastwards directions in a series of straight lines through barren salt flats for 50km (31m) until reaching the Atrek river, the course of which it follows for 124km (77m) to a point just south of the Turkmen village of Chat. The border then continues overland eastwards/north-eastwards across the Kopet Dag mountain range for 151km (94m) before reaching the Sumbar river, the course of which it then follows for 41km (26m). It then continues overland across mountain ridges in a broadly south- eastern arc for 455km (283m) to the vicinity of the Iranian village of Chahchaheh. From here a roughly straight line section runs for 77km (48m) to the Harirud river (Tedzhen in Turkmen), the course of which it follows south for 120km (75m) to the Afghan tripoint. The immediate border area is largely uninhabited, except for the central section around Ashgabat on the Turkmen side; this area of the border, plus the western section, is roughly paralleled by highways. The Turkmen section of the Trans-Caspian Railway also roughly parallels the frontier in the central section, coming less than half a mile north of the boundary in the vicinity of Lotfabad. On the Iranian side, roughly 50 miles south of the border runs the major highways connecting the towns of Gorgan, Bojnurd and Mashhad, with roads connecting the smaller towns to the north. History The border was inherited from the old Persia-USSR border, which largely took its current shape during the 19th Century after the Russian conquest of Central Asia and its annexation of the Khanate of Kokand and the Emirate of Bukhara in 1865-68. In 1869 Persia and Russia agreed that the Atrek river would be the border between them. This boundary was confirmed and then extended eastwards to the vicinity of Ashgabat in 1881 following further Russian advances into Turkmen lands, and then to the border with Afghanistan in 1893; various further delimitations of this border occurred in the following years. Further small changes were made in the period 1954-57 when Iran and the USSR (as they now were) agreed to more clearly demarcate their common border, including the Atrek delta region which had since altered due to the shrinking of the Caspian Sea.

It was designed by the New South Wales Colonial Architect's office under the control of James Barnet and built in 1879. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Scone is located in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. The town is the commercial and administrative centre of a pastoral, agricultural and dairying district noted for its horse and cattle studs. The first European in the area was surveyor Henry Dangar who, in 1824, passed by the area just west of the present town site and crossed over the Liverpool Range. Dangar's favourable report on the district led to an immediate land grab by wealthy settlers including Francis Little who established Invermein in 1825. A village named Redbank began to emerge by 1828 but the traffic began to shift to the east following a new route (the Great North Road) into the Hunter Valley. In 1836, an inn and store were established adjacent to this track, forming the beginnings of the settlement of Scone. The newer settlement, officially called Invermein was later gazetted in 1837 as Scone. Development proceeded, albeit slowly, in the 1840s, with an Anglican church, school and a courthouse. A national school opened in 1863 and in 1871, the railway arrived. A telegraph office was established at Scone in 1877, and in 1879, the current building (post and telegraph office with associated quarters) was constructed by the New South Wales Colonial Architect's office under the control of James Barnet. Additions to this building were undertaken in 1908 by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office architect Walter Vernon and in 1914 by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways Office under George Oakeshott/E. Henderson. A small addition was added to the Liverpool Street frontage, and in the 1960s a further single-storey addition provided a post office box lobby and additional staff areas along the Liverpool Street frontage.  Description  Scone Post Office is at 117 Liverpool Street, corner Kelly Street, Scone, comprising the whole of Lot 3 DP 700953. Scone Post Office is a substantial double-storey, hipped-roof brick building which dates from 1879, with later additions, and is located on the south-west corner of the town's major intersection, Liverpool and Kelly Streets. The building had its main entrance to the north (Liverpool Street), with the quarters originally entered from the east (Kelly Street). The original 1870s posted verandah to Liverpool Street was removed to make way for the Federation-era addition which enlarged the main postal chamber. This addition includes recessed panels of rough cast stucco to the brickwork and is framed with a brick coping. The main entrance bay is set slightly forward of the flanking bays. The entry door has a fanlight and fixed sidelights. A concrete ramp and steps are a later addition. The balcony roof is a skillion roof form but there is a small gablet positioned above the entrance. Originally the balcony roof was supported by pairs - with the exception of the clustered set of three to the corner - of timber posts. These are visible to the interior of the balcony where they intersect the later infill glazing. To Kelly Street, the front ground floor window and the surrounding wall (nearest Liverpool Street) are part of a Federation addition. The join in the brickwork is clearly evident, and there is a step in the rendered plinth. Two windows have bracketed sun hoods, with shingle roofs. The arches of the windows are without keystones, but the door and blind door have accentuated keystones. The first floor on this side has three evenly spaced windows with similarly treated heads. This area is defined with a faux palisade fence on a new brick base. A path leads to the \\"side\\" doorway. The blind door beside the side door would lead to the main chamber. The brickwork is executed in garden wall bond. The three windows upstairs include a blind window (at the upstairs landing). It would seem that this approach was to assist with a symmetrical composition, as a further blind window has been used in the design on the ground floor. Windows have wide sills, supported by brackets as seen in the post office buildings at Muswellbrook and Maitland. The roof to the main building is a double hipped form with brick chimneys and rendered caps without pots. The main post office space (ground floor) has, in more recent times, been refitted in the standard Australia Post retail format with two counters. Within this space, nibs and piers indicate an earlier arrangement of walls, since removed. The window heads are visible above the display, and a fireplace has been obscured by a plasterboard partition. The sorting room also includes a rear office, postal box sorting area and store rooms. There are timber framed glass highlights facing the south. All internal joinery is painted. A former large opening, with panelled reveals, has been reduced with a plasterboard partition. The interior to the Kelly Street elevation consists of a stair hall, a former dining room, former telegraph room and a service area. The staircase is timber, with square newel posts and turned balusters. The upper floor (former residence/quarters) comprises the stair landing, and four rooms, two of which open to the now enclosed verandah to Liverpool Street. All timber joinery has been painted over. A subsequent single storey addition to Liverpool Street adjoins the main entrance and is setback from the main building line, thus further emphasising the entrance bay. Its design is sympathetic to the Federation era additions. It has a three bay casement window, and a hipped, corrugated steel roof. It contains a locker room, lunch room, male toilet, retail store and a small sorting room. The kitchen wing adjoins the main building to the rear and has a hipped corrugated steel roof. The three windows of the kitchen wing have tuck pointed arches, as do those to the rear elevation, and the double hung sashes have vertical glazing bars. A ledged door, with its original rimlock and slate threshold leads to an airlock outside the kitchen. The airlock has painted brick walls with cut-andstruck joints, indicating that it was once an external door, and that the kitchen wing was built subsequent to the main building. The fireplace is extant but infilled with cabinetry and retains its timber mantle. A bathroom and laundry adjoin the kitchen. The rear yard is paved with concrete, and there is a concrete block storage building. The private garden is separated by a paling fence and steel gate leading to a steel \\"kit-form\\" carport. = Key areas/elements = * Prominent corner siting * Intact external elements including face brick treatment, arched windows, render and tuck * pointing details = Condition = The overall condition and intactness of the Scone Post Office is fair, given that the Federation later alterations can be regarded as additions. = Original fabric = * Structural frame: Concrete footings and floors.

Balcony enclosed.  Heritage listing  Scone Post Office is of historical and social significance. The building has been an important public and postal building for over 130 years. Typologically, Scone Post Office is a hybrid comprising a James Barnet's central Victorian building design with Walter Vernon's substantial Federation additions. It contributes to the historic and predominantly nineteenth century streetscapes and heritage character of this part of the Central Scone Conservation Area. Significant elements of Scone Post Office include the 1879 two-storey building component, including the original quarters entered from Kelly Street, and the single- storey wing on Kelly Street; and the additions of 1908 and 1914. The long single-storey 1960s post office box wing to the Liverpool Street frontage is a lesser element. Scone Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Scone Post Office, of 1879 with later additions, and originally designed by New South Wales Colonial Architect James Barnet, is of historical significance. The building has been an important public and postal building for over 130 years, in the centre of the historic town of Scone. It followed the earlier telegraph office of 1877, which in turn was established in response to Scone's development from its original settlement in the early nineteenth century. While altered and extended, the 1870s building component, including quarters, remains clearly evident and prominent. This, together with the overall scale of the post office and its corner location, enhance this aspect of significance. Criterion D: Characteristic values Scone Post Office is an example of: * Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * Victorian Italianate style with substantial Federation additions * the work of the New South Wales Colonial Architect's office (James Barnet), the New South Wales Government Architect's office (Walter Vernon) and the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways office (George Oakeshott / E Henderson). Typologically, the Scone Post Office is considered to be a second generation post office, originally designed with a post and telegraph office and quarters. The building underwent alteration during the Federation period with a substantial addition to the Liverpool Street fa√ßade. More broadly, as a composite building, the typological intactness has been compromised, although the earlier 1870s component remains discernible. The first floor also retains fabric and planning associated with its original residential use. Stylistically and architecturally, Scone Post Office is a hybrid comprising a central Victorian building with substantial Federation additions, the latter generally being sympathetically designed and integrated into the Victorian building although they have to a degree compromised the external presentation and intactness of the original building. Notwithstanding this, the post office's 1870s fabric, form and architectural detailing, including that which is concentrated in the main square-plan, double-storey, hipped roofed building remains readable and evident. Some of these details are also of interest, including the header arches over the windows, which are an unusual touch of high Victorian vigour in the New South Wales context. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Scone Post Office is a substantial and prominently located historic post office, which contributes to the heritage character of the historic and predominantly nineteenth century streetscapes in this part of the Central Scone Conservation Area. The corner siting facilitates generous views of the property; the architectural detailing of the 1870s component is also of aesthetic value. Criterion G: Social value Scone Post Office has been the focus of local postal communication services for over 130 years. Its prominent location, valued heritage character, and role as a recognisable historic public building in the collection of valued nineteenth century buildings in Central Scone, enhance its social value.

It was built in 1929. It is also known as #341 Randwick 33Kv Zone and Canberra Street substation. The property is owned by Ausgrid, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The substation was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 the Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Electricity supply= The Randwick substation is a purpose designed and built structure constructed in 1930. \\"The site was resumed in 1929 by the Municipal Council of Sydney and then over by Sydney County Council in 1935, the resumption cost A¬£2,500. This substation was a major part of the distribution network of the Bunnerong Power station and fed all the smaller substations in the Randwick area. The building was completed in 1930 following a cost blow-out owing to the contractor receiving instructions for a wider building than shown on the original plan and the fact that it was essential to have one half of the building constructed and ready before the other half\\".Randwick Heritage Study. Historical Period: 1926‚Äì1950.  Description  The Randwick substation is a large and attractively decorated building that presents a street fa√ßade with elaborate brick decoration designed in the Interwar Mediterranean style. The fa√ßade is composed of two sections: A two- storey block comprising a high entrance door with lintel arch motifs, and three groupings of triple windows: one group with arches, another with balcony and balusters. The second part of the fa√ßade is a symmetrical arrangement with a large arched doorway flanked by pilasters and arch headed windows surmounted by an ornate identity panel. The parapets include curved roof tiles. The Randwick substation is constructed in load-bearingtuck pointed face brick. The windows appear to be metal framed multi-paned. Large plant access doors are steel roller shutter type. The architectural style is Interwar Mediterranean.

He played college football at the University of Arizona. Early years Taylor graduated in 2016 from Centennial High School. He was named Mr. Football as state‚Äôs top offensive player by CalHiSports.com. Also he was named All-Inland First Team. He was recognized as a Blue-Grey All-American. He gained 2,290 and 44 touchdowns as a senior. He earned a three-star recruit by Scout.com, Rivals.com and 247 Sports. Taylor had offers from Washington State, Nevada, Ohio, Montana State, Sacramento State and Weber State from the Big Sky Conference as well. Taylor committed to Arizona in 2015. College career =2016 season= He played in four games with one career start before going down with an injury as a true freshman. Taylor rushed for 261 yards and two touchdowns on 38 carries, even though he barely played in Arizona‚Äôs first game of the season against BYU. The best proof came in a two-game stretch where Taylor rushed for a combined 267 yards on 37 carries with two touchdowns, particularly in Arizona‚Äôs dominant win over Hawaii in Week 3. Taylor was poised for a breakout freshman season before the injury in Pac-12 opener, which occurred during the Wildcats‚Äô fourth game against Washington. He still totaled 97 yards on 19 carries with a touchdown. =2017 season= Taylor, a redshirt freshman from Corona, Calif., played in all 12 games and was the Pac-12‚Äôs top freshman rusher with 828 yards (6.1 yards/carry), averaged 69.0 yards per game, and added five touchdowns. He rushed for a career-best 153 yards on 14 carries (10.9 avg.) with two touchdowns vs. Washington State. Taylor was a major contributor to Arizona‚Äôs ground game that averaged 324.4 yards per game (3rd in the FBS) and a school single-season team record 48 rushing touchdowns. Arizona rushed for 300 or more yards seven times, including a pair of 500+ yard games with a UA single- game record 534 yards vs. Oregon State. He was the Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year. =2018 season= Taylor was put on the Doak Walker Award watch list in July 2018. Against Southern Utah, Taylor returned a kickoff for a touchdown. His redshirt sophomore year finished with 1,434 rushing yards and, 49 receiving yards, and seven total touchdowns. =2019 season= As a redshirted junior in 2019, Taylor finished with 721 rushing yards and five touchdowns. On November 19, 2019, Taylor announced that we would forgo his senior year and enter the 2020 NFL Draft. Professional career Taylor signed with the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent on May 5, 2020. On September 5, 2020, he was waived by the team and signed to the practice squad the following day. He was promoted to the active roster on September 7, 2020. As of week four of the 2020 NFL season Taylor has played in three out of four of the Patriots games.

Etymology & common names  The species epithet campicola is derived from its preferred habitat; the campos, Portuguese for grassland. A local name for it in Paraguay in the Guaran√≠ language was recorded as yataycapii. This name should likely be spelled yata'i kapi'i and translates as 'forage/straw/grass Butia'. A Portuguese name used in Brazil is butiazinho azul (='blue Butia- diminutive').  Taxonomy & history  It was first collected by the Swiss physician and botanist √âmile Hassler in Paraguay in the Sierra de Mbaracay√∫ between 1898 to 1899, and in Piribebuy in 1900, according to the labels on his herbarium specimens. It was formally described by Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues in the 1900 published part of the Plantae Hasslerianae as Cocos campicola. Subsequently it was never seen again. In 1996 it was rated as 'endangered' in a publication of the IUCN, in which rediscovery was mentioned as a priority. The species was rediscovered that same year by Belen Jim√©nez in one of the areas it was first collected, in the grasslands of the Aguara √ëu in what was by now the Mbaracay√∫ Forest Nature Reserve; this was published in 1998. Noblick excluded it from the 1998 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Actually the palms had already been collected earlier in 1995 and 1996 in San Pedro Department in Paraguay, but these specimens were only recognised as such by Henderson in 1999, and this information was first published 2000.Magill B, Solomon J, Stimmel H (2016). Tropicos Specimen Data. Missouri Botanical Garden. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/hja69f accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-09-21. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1257824240 & https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1258281651 In 1916 Odoardo Beccari moved this taxon from Cocos to Syagrus along with many South American Cocos taxa. By 1995 a number of researchers had been convinced it was in fact a species of Butia, and had taken to calling it as such, despite it never being formally moved to Butia (fide Henderson et al. [1995], IUCN [1996]). Noblick finally did this in 2004. In 1973 a specimen of 'trunkless' palm was collected in Nova Andradina, which was identified by Glassman to be B. paraguayensis in 1980. Similarly, in 1987 an abundant population of subterranean-trunked palms had been recorded and collected in Porto Murtinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, 57 km east of the capital. These had been determined to be B. paraguayensis by Noblick in 1992. Both collections seem to have been reclassified as B. campicola by 2015. A 2000 collection by Soares from a population of dwarf palms in Goi√°s were determined to be B. campicola (by others), but these have now been reclassified. Other collections of this B. campicola in Brazil were made in 2009 in Iguatemi and at a spot in Amambai where it was locally common. Because this plants had in fact been collected earlier before but had not been identified or identified as B. paraguayensis, Belen Jim√©nez thus did not actually 'rediscover' the species; what she and her co-authors did, in fact, was be the first to correctly identify these palms in their collections.  Description  It is a very small palm with a short, squat, subterranean truck, usually single-stemmed, approximately 15cm in diameter. It may sometimes, rarely, branch underground with 2-3 heads. The entire plant is less than 1m in height, often less, the thin, glaucous leaflets and invisible trunk make it most resemble a tuft of blueish-grey grass, and it is easily overlooked. The 3-9 arching leaves have a 4-20cm petiole and 19-77cm rachis. The 25-62cm pinnae (leaflets) are evenly arranged 2cm apart in a single plane on each side, so that each pinnae pair makes a neat 'V'-shape. There are 6-16 pinnae per side. The 40-70cm peduncular bract (or spathe) is woody and smooth, The inflorescence is simple, very rarely branched, with a peduncle of 42-77cm and a flower spike 9-21cm long. The oval to round fruit are 1.8 x 1.5cm and greenish-purple to brown (when exposed to the elements), with sweet-sour, yellow flesh and almost always a single roundish seed. = Similar species = According to Barbosa Rodrigues in 1900 it is quite similar to Syagrus petraea, especially in habitus, but the fruit and flowers are very different. According to Noblick in 2006 it is most similar to Butia leptospatha, differing by having a much larger, longer and more robust spathe and inflorescence, the spathe width being thicker and the texture more leathery. Deble et al. in 2006 compare it to B. lallemantii; noting it is much smaller, branches much less often and less when it does, and has different shaped and coloured fruit. According to Soares in 2015 it can distinguished from all other acaulescent Butia species which possess an inflorescence passing beyond the length of the spathe, by having the longest leaf rachis. It occurs in the same range as Butia arenicola, B. exospadix, B. lepidotispatha, B. leptospatha, and B. paraguayensis.  Distribution and habitat  In Brazil the species occurs in the south of state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where it is locally abundant in some spots. It has been collected in the municipalities of Amambai, Iguatemi, Nova Andradina and Porto Murtinho. In Paraguay it occurs in the departments of Amambay, Canindey√∫, Cordillera (only collected in 1900) and San Pedro. It grows in open, sandy spots in cerrado grasslands, often in gently sloping areas with deep red sand soils. It has been collected growing at altitudes of 115 to 485m. It endures occasional frosts in its native habitat. The region in which it grows has marked seasons, with a cooler, wet winter during which low- lying areas may get temporarily flooded, and long hot and dry summers with frequent long droughts. It is found growing associated with the palms Butia paraguayensis, Syagrus lilliputiana and Allagoptera leucocalyx in Mbaracay√∫, Paraguay.Tulig M, Ramirez J, Watson K (2018). The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium (NY). Version 1.6. The New York Botanical Garden. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/6e8nje accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-09-21. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1796770396 Irene M. Gauto et al. wrote in 2011 that the species might also occur elsewhere according to their computer- generated population models, and that it was likely under-collected. They stated in 2011 that this taxon was endemic to Paraguay, despite it having been collected in Brazil by this time.  Horticulture  In 2007 there were possibly only two seedlings in cultivation, in England and Argentina. By 2010 it was grown by Harri Lorenzi, a senior Brazilian botanist specialised in palms, in his Plantarum institute. As of 2016 seed of the palm has become more regularly available from niche vendors. Propagation is by seed. Germination can take months and germination rates are quite low. It is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. It is said to take -5¬∞C, but should be protected at 0¬∞C in the Netherlands. In Nova Odessa (see climate), Brazil, Lorenzi grows his palms on large mounds of loose sandy material.  Conservation  The IUCN briefly rated it as 'endangered' between 1996-1998 in a period when nothing was known about the species and it hadn't been recorded in 98 years. Soares in 2015 opined it is rare and threatened due to its preferential deep-soiled habitat which is also perfect for agriculture. Lorenzi also believes it is threatened. Gauto et al. in 2011 considered it to be 'vulnerable' in Paraguay, using the criteria \\"extent of occurrence estimated to be less than 100km2 indicated by severely fragmented habitat or known to exist at only a single location.\\" According to Vera in 2013 it is rare in Paraguay. It is protected within the Mbaracay√∫ Forest Nature Reserve, but this is the only known locality in which this species is protected. By 2010 there were ex situ plantings of this species at Lorenzi's Plantarum institute in Nova Odessa, collected during an expedition to Amamba√≠. As of 2018 the conservation status has not been evaluated by the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora in Brazil.

It was designed by Walter Frederick White, City Architect's Department and Municipal Council of Sydney and built during 1930 by J Rutherford. It is also known as #349 Princes Street substation. The property is owned by Ausgrid, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 May 2008.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 the Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen and Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Electricity supply= Electricity substation No. 349 is a purpose designed and built structure dating from , constructed by the Municipal Council of Sydney to supply power to consumers in the Randwick area. From the late 1920s there was enormous expansion in electricity provision within the Sydney region, driven by the suburban growth of the 1920s and 1930s. Under this impetus, dozens of electricity substations were built annually to service demand. =Historical documentation= * \\"Erected by J Rutherford on tender for the Municipal Council of Sydney which was the electricity authority before the Sydney County Council took over in 1935.

From 1904 until 1935 the MCS, as both an electricity generation and distribution authority, constructed hundreds of small distribution substations throughout Sydney, many of which are still in service. The MCS supplied electricity to retail customers around the inner city, inner west and lower north shore and provided bulk power to outer western and northern suburbs such as Penrith, Hornsby and Manly. The MCS initially competed against a number of private electricity supply companies. These were mostly small-scale operations which the MCS had acquired by 1914. The exception was the Electric Light and Power Supply Corporation (ELPSC), established in 1909, which was the one major private player in the Sydney electricity market until 1955 when it was nationalised by the Electricity Commission of NSW. In 1935 the functions of the MCS Electricity Department were taken over by the Sydney County Council (SCC) with broad responsibility for electricity supply across the Sydney region. There was rapid expansion in the electricity distribution network with 40-50 substations constructed annually. The scale of SCC's operations consistently made it the largest local authority in Australia throughout the second half of the 20th century. In 1991 the SCC was reconstituted as Sydney Electricity (a statutory authority). In 1996 Sydney Electricity merged with the Hunter regional electricity authority Orion (formerly Shortland Electricity) and was corporatised as EnergyAustralia. =Substation design, 1904 to present= Electricity distribution substations were generally built as modest 1 or 2 storey buildings, with Zone Substations considerably larger in scale. The style and nature of substation construction became progressively more standardised as the electricity network expanded. While the earliest substations tended to be large, well-ornamented public buildings, as they became more commonplace, substations became smaller and simpler. This reflected the need for cost- effective construction methods, the reduction in size of electrical equipment and the speed with which substations needed to be constructed to keep pace with demand. While early substations were often purpose-designed and built for a specific location, by the late 1920s the trend was for standardised designs built to a similar size and generally designed to fit on a standard suburban subdivision block, typically . Designs did keep pace with architectural trends and it is possible to identify a number of different and distinct architectural styles of substations. One-off designed substations did continue to be built well into the mid-20th century thought these tended to be restricted to what the SCC referred to as \\"high class\\" suburbs in Sydney's east. The number of substations constructed in the Sydney region exploded from the late 1920s, with dozens of substations being constructed in any one year to cope with expanding demand. While in the early years of network construction many substations had unique characteristics and were sited in response to a particular need, from the late 1920s standardised designs were generally used and expansion was based on a need to establish and expand the electricity grid rather than in response to localised or site-specific issues. By the 1950s the trend towards architecturally designed and detailed substations was exhausted. From that point on, the freestanding metal kiosk- style substation was progressively introduced, while buildings, where they were constructed, tended towards strictly functional unadorned brick enclosures. Substation design was also influenced by the general changes in Australian building construction in the mid-20th century. The trend towards larger steel and concrete buildings saw \\"chamber\\"\\" style substations incorporated directly within new buildings. In such circumstances the electricity provider had little or no input into the architectural style of the substation chamber, merely supplying technical requirements which influenced the location and size of the substation within the new building. This trend also saw smaller older-style substations demolished in some areas and replaced with new chamber substations incorporated into a new development. This style of construction is commonplace today, particularly in high density urban areas. EnergyAustralia's older substations range from very finely detailed to very plain and functional. The early government-run electrical authorities were aware of the need to make substations in residential areas attractive and in keeping with the surroundings, and an architect joined the substation design area of Sydney County Council in 1936. By contrast, the modern trend is to make substations essentially invisible, through incorporating them into larger buildings, placing them wholly underground or within anonymous small steel boxes which tend to be ignored in urban environments. The exception to this continues to be the zone substations and high voltage switchyards, which continue to require large buildings or areas of land to house equipment. Historically, better quality buildings tended to be reserved for what the MCS referred to as \\"high class\\" suburbs (particularly Woollahra and Mosman) while middle- and working-class suburbs generally received much simpler, functional buildings. Designs tended to be reused, sometimes with only minimal variation. There are also marked stylistic differences between substations constructed by government as opposed to those constructed by the Electric Light and Power Supply Corporation (ELPSC) throughout the first half of the 20th century. The ELPSC substations tend to be functionalist brick boxes with only the slightest degree of architectural detailing or ornamentation, whereas the substations constructed by municipalities, while often reusing the same underlying design with minor variation, tend to be more finely detailed and in many instances are designed to match the architecture of the surrounding area. This may reflect the different nature of the competing priorities of a private as opposed to a government enterprise. A number of former ELPSC structures exist within the EnergyAustralia network.  Description  Electricity Substation No. 349 is an Interwar Mediterranean style building with an element of Spanish Mission style. It is a single gable roofed building with a symmetrical gable wall which has a single large arched doorway surmounted by an elaborate plaster ornament. One side wall has a personnel door and a raised gable roofed ventilation turret with simulated windows, balcony and ornamental ironwork, and decorative arch motifs forming the supporting brackets. The ventilation panels are formed by curved concrete or ceramic blocks set into what are window spaces for metal louvres in other similar designs. The substation is constructed in load-bearing brick and finished with a smooth layer of stucco. The roof is curved ceramic tile. Curved ceramic or concrete blocks form ventilation panels in the side walls. = Condition = As at 18 October 2007, the condition of the building was generally good. Downpipes discharge to ground. The exterior is architecturally intact. Internal equipment has been completely altered. = Modifications and dates = Gutters and downpipes replaced. Modern chain wire fences.  Heritage listing  As at 25 October 2007, Electricity Substation No 349, Randwick, is significant at state level as an aesthetically distinctive, finely detailed, unusually large, and highly intact example of an Interwar Mediterranean style substation with elements of Spanish Mission style. The substation was designed by the City Architect's Office of the Municipal Council of Sydney and built to distribute power to consumers in response to the strong residential growth in the surrounding suburbs in the 1920s and 1930s. It is a fine example of the high standard of work of the City Architect's Office of the Sydney Municipal Council, which was conscious of the need to erect substations suitable to the urban environment of the time. It demonstrates the Council's express policy of constructing finely designed buildings in areas it considered to be \\"high class\\" suburbs and is testament to the past creative endeavour of electricity providers in applying architectural values to utilitarian structures. It is the largest and most intact of this style of distribution substation and remains in service for its original purpose. Electricity Substation No. 349 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 May 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick, is significant at the local level both for its association with a significant historical phase, in the major expansion of electricity provision to Sydney's rapidly developing eastern suburbs in the 1920s and 1930s, and in demonstrating the continuity of historical activity in the provision of electricity. Substation No. 349, Randwick is historically important as a component of the electricity distribution network which delivered electrical power to consumers in Sydney's rapidly developing eastern suburbs. As at 2007, the substation continued to serve its original function within Sydney's electricity network. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Electricity substation No. 349, Randwick is significant at state level for its association with the work of Walter Frederick White (ARIA), City Architect's Office, Municipal Council of Sydney and its successor organisation, Sydney County Council, where White worked between and . It is the best known example to date (2007) of White's design for electrical substations. White is known to have been responsible for the substantial and sympathetic 1929 extensions to the Interwar Art Nouveau/Art Deco styled Auburn Zone Substation No. 167 and for the design of the Waverley Zone Substation No. 269, Bondi (1928) which is also in the Interwar Mediterranean/Spanish Mission styles and is the largest substation (and only zone substation) to be designed in this style. Further research should reveal additional surviving substations built by the Municipal Council of Sydney and Sydney County Council that can be attributed to W. F. White. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Electricity substation No. 349, Randwick, is significant at state level as an aesthetically distinctive, unusually large, unusually well detailed and rare example of a purpose-designed and built Interwar Mediterranean/Spanish Mission style substation. The substation is a fine example of the high standard of work of the City Architect's Office of the Sydney Municipal Council, which was conscious of the need to erect substations suitable to the urban environment of the time. It demonstrates the Council's express policy of constructing finely designed buildings in areas it considered to be \\"high class\\" suburbs and is testament to the past creative endeavour of electricity providers in applying architectural values to utilitarian structures. It is similar in design to the larger, less detailed Waverley Zone Substation No. 269, Bondi. Both substations were designed by the WF White, City Architect's Office, Municipal Council of Sydney in the Mediterranean/Spanish Mission style. Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick, is the most intact of the Spanish Mission styled substations in Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site does not meet this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site does not meet this criterion. Internal equipment has been completely altered over the life of the building. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick, is significant at state level as the only distribution substation built in the Interwar Mediterranean/Spanish Mission styles with such a fine level of detail that also remains intact, in original condition, and retains all of its architectural detail (which is often missing on substations from this period). Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick, shares stylistic similarities with the following four distribution substations (all in Sydney's eastern suburbs) that were built by the Municipal Council of Sydney (MCS) or Sydney County Council (SCC) between 1929 and 1939: *No. 300, Clovelly (c. 1929, Interwar Spanish Mission, MCS) *No. 314, Vaucluse (1930, Interwar Mediterranean, MCS) *No. 364, Bellevue Hill (1931, Interwar Mediterranean, MCS) *No. 592, Watsons Bay (1939, Interwar Mediterranean, SCC). These four substations are assessed on EnergyAustralia's section 170 Heritage and Conservation Register 2007 as being significant at the local level. They are all smaller, less detailed and less intact structures than Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Electricity Substation No. 349, Randwick, is significant at state level as typical, in terms of function, within the electricity network. It is, however, unusually large and well detailed for a distribution substation.

It was also known as the royal palace (; ) or the Hala dels Draps. It was located in the Pla de Palau, in the center of the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona. The palace had its origin in a woolen port warehouse of medieval times, until it was converted into a palace in 1652 and became the official residence of the viceroys of Catalonia. It became the Royal Palace and residence of the Spanish Royal Family in Barcelona in 1844. It was destroyed by a fire in 1875. History =Middle Ages= The palace has its origins in the ‚ÄòPorxo del Forment‚Äô, a wheat warehouse constructed in 1314. Next to it, a cloth market was built in 1389, which was also known as the Hala dels Draps. The buildings were merged in 1514 and a floor was added to the building which served as an arsenal. =Palace of the Viceroy= King Philip IV confiscated the building in 1652 and purposed it to serve as the residence of the Viceroy of Catalonia. By order of Viceroy Vicente Gonzaga Doria a new palace was constructed between 1668 and 1688. The architect was Josep de la Concepci√≥, a Carmelite monk, who designed a baroque building. The palace had a quadrangular plan with a central courtyard, three levels with balconies and a facade with Gothic elements. Of the interior, the main hall, called Sal√≥n de los Festines, stood out, with a rectangular floor plan and two floors high. In 1700, by initiative of viceroy Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt a connection was added to the Santa Maria del Mar church. During the War of the Spanish Succession Archduke Charles of Habsburg was installed as king of Spain in the building in 1705. Three years later, he married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in the Santa Maria del Mar in 1708. They resided in the palace until 1711, when they left for Vienna in Austria. With the Nueva Planta decrees the office of the viceroy was abolished, and the palace became the residence of the Captain General of Catalonia. The palace got a fa√ßade in a neoclassical style in 1771, designed by the architect Juan Miguel de Roncali. =Royal Palace= The palace became the royal palace in 1844, when the Captain General moved his residence to a former convent. During this time, the palace was reconstructed in neo-gothic style. During the various visits to Barcelona the Spanish Royal family staid in the palace. During the First Spanish Republic it was the seat of a court. The palace was destroyed by a fire in 1875 and was not rebuilt. It was not until 1919, that a new royal residence was erected in Barcelona, the Palau Reial de Pedralbes. The current royal residence in Barcelona is the Palaeut Alb√©niz in the Joan Maragall Gardens on the Montju√Øc mountain, which was designed for the 1929 Universal exposition in the exhibition site itself.

It lies north of Jan Mayen and rises from 41‚Äì43 million years old ocean crust. The reasons for the volcanic activity at Vesteris are unclear and may involve lithospheric processes. It is a volcano formed chiefly by basanitic rocks and has an erosion-flattened top. The seamount is covered by lava flows and subsidiary cones. The seamount started developing no earlier than 13 million years ago and eruptions continued until the Pleistocene/Holocene transition; there were a number of eruptions in the last 60,000 years. Whether there was Holocene activity 5,000‚Äì6,000 years ago or present-day hydrothermal activity is unclear. A variety of lifeforms are found both on Vesteris Seamount and within its rocks. Layers of sponges and bryozoans cover the upper parts of the seamount and form structures like mounds. This ecosystem has been compared to coral reefs.  History  Vesteris Seamount was probably known to fishers and seal hunters for over a hundred years as there is a large amount of fish above Vesteris Seamount, which draws both seals and fishers alike to the seamount. The seamount was originally named Vesterisbanken by Eggvin 1963, which showed Vesteris on his bathymetric map.  Geography and geology  The seamount is located in the Greenland Sea-Norwegian Sea, west of due north from Jan Mayen Island and in between Norway and Greenland. Vesteris Seamount is an isolated volcanic seamount that reaches a depth of below sea level and with two summits that rise from a plateau at depth; it is likely that the summit once emerged from the sea. The summit area of the seamount is flat, probably due to wave erosion during the Weichselian glaciation, and sediment cover is scarce. Lava flows extend from the summit area to depths of almost , and sheet flows, scarps, pillow lavas, lava tubes and lava debris have been observed on the seamount. The seamount is elongated in about northeast-south-southwest direction, with ridges radiating from its northern sector and the lower southern sector spreading southwestward like a tongue. This elongation matches the trend of magnetic lineations on the surrounding seafloor, implying that it may be controlled by the surrounding tectonic environment. The submarine slopes of the seamount are quite steep and show two benches at and depth. The seamount has dimensions of on the seafloor. About 15‚Äì20 parasitic vents dot the deeper flanks of the seamount and reach height, and small ridges en echelon to Vesteris are found on the southeastern flank. The total volume of the seamount is about . The seamount rises about above the seafloor which below Vesteris has an age of about 43-41 million years. The Mohns Ridge lies east and the Kolbeinsey Ridge south of Vesteris, while the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone crosses the ocean floor south of the seamount; the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone connects the Mohns and Kolbeinsey Ridges ‚Äì both part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ‚Äì with each other. A channel created presumably by turbidites from Greenland passes northward west of Vesteris. There is no evidence of additional volcanic edifices in the neighbourhood of the seamount, or of any other similar seamounts in the wider region, although recent volcanic intrusions may occur in the direct neighbourhood of the seamount. = Composition = Volcanic rocks dredged from Vesteris include basanite as the major component, phonotephrite and tephrite but also alkali basalt, mugearite and trachybasalt. Samples taken are porphyritic, rich in vesicles and contain phenocrysts of amphibole, clinopyroxene, kaersutite, olivine and plagioclase; these minerals also make up the groundmass of the rocks. These volcanic rocks define two separate geochemical suites, one formed by the basanites-tephrites and the other by the alkali basalts-mugearites. The formation of these two magma suites has been explained with fractional crystallization processes, mixing between different magmas and partial melting. Geochemical patterns indicate that the source magmas of Vesteris have similar sources as the magmas involved in other volcanoes of the North Atlantic north of Iceland. Differences between volcanic rocks erupted earlier in the history of the volcano and more recent products may imply that magma chemistry changed over time. Aside from primary volcanic rocks, drop stones carried to the seamount by icebergs have been found on Vesteris as well. = Origin of the volcanism = Several different theories for the origin of Vesteris Seamount have been proposed: * One theory presumes that mantle melts could rise through the lithosphere in cracks generated by the tectonics of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and that this process is responsible for the formation of Vesteris Seamount. The elongated shape of the seamount and the parallelism with other bathymetric features in the region supports the idea that the seamount formed on a zone of crustal weakness. * The seamount was at first proposed to have originated over a Jan Mayen hotspot. An origin at a mantle plume has been considered to be unlikely, even if the recent volcanism were to be considered rejuvenated, and there is no evidence of a hotspot track. * It may have formed at the Mid- Atlantic Ridge, but based on its shallow depth and the young radiometric ages it appears to be a younger feature. Sedimentation patterns around the seamount also do not support a formation in a near-ridge environment.  Biology and climate  Vesteris Seamount displays high biological productivity. The summit area of the seamount is densely inhabited by mats and biogenic structures formed by ascidians, bryozoans, polychaetes and sponges; in other sectors of the volcano sponges are accompanied by crinoids. Actinians, brittle stars, hydrozoans, molluscs, radiolarians and starfish are also found, as well as foraminiferal sands. Similar lifeforms are also found on the lower slopes of the seamount. Traces of endolithic fungi have been found in rock samples from the seamount. Life on Vesteris has formed a variety of structures, including hedges, mats, mounds, spurs and thickets, and a dense layer of biogenic sediments and living specimens covers large areas of the upper Vesteris Seamount. This environment has been compared to a coral reef. The seamount lies close to the polar front with the East Greenland Current transporting freshwater from ice melt and ice to the seamount. The sea above Vesteris is covered by sea ice for most of the year except for August and September, and water temperatures on the surface of the seamount are around in summer.  Eruption history  Vesteris Seamount was active for no longer time than the last 13-7 million years; volcanic activity at the seamount occurred in episodic stages. Rock samples from the summit area have yielded ages of about 110,000 years ago, while argon-argon dating has shown that trachybasalts and trachytes were erupted 650,000‚Äì500,000 years ago and the mugearites between 85,000‚Äì10,000 years ago. Ash layers and traces of past hydrothermal activity suggest that Vesteris was active during the Quaternary, with frequent eruptions in the last 60,000 years. Some ash layers have been estimated to be less than 25,000 years old on the basis of the sedimentation rates albeit with great uncertainty, others were emplaced between 16,000‚Äì14,000 years ago and there is evidence of even younger ash layers. Some ash layers may have been emplaced by pyroclastic flows or turbidity currents. During the last ice age when the summit of Vesteris Seamount was close to the sea surface, phreatomagmatic eruptions generated ash falls. One ash layer has been found and appears to imply an eruption between 6,000‚Äì5,000 years ago although it is not certain that Holocene eruptions occurred; the most recent eruption may have occurred at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary. If there was Holocene activity that would make Vesteris the only known Holocene seamount in the Arctic. There is no evidence for present-day or historic activity at Vesteris, although low temperature hydrothermal activity may be occurring.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. History The three-story Modern Movement building was built in 1967 for the First National Bank of Davenport, a part of the Brenton Bank network in Iowa. It was originally designed to be a part of a larger commercial development with several Mid-century modern-style buildings. When those plans changed the bank building was self-financed independently of the larger development. The building is significant for its embrace of New Formalism architecture. The Davenport Public Library building downtown and this building are considered the two most significant examples of the style in the city. It also marks the shift from the historical revival styles and the more restricted expressions of Modernism. There was an emphasis placed on the building's structure and construction grid on a raised base. The three-story concrete and steel frame structure was designed by the local architectural firm of Stewart-Robison- Laffan. After the bank discontinued its operations, the building was acquired by the Davenport Community School District for its offices and other programs. In July 2018 the school district moved its operations into a former school building across the street. Newbury Living of West Des Moines, Iowa began converting the building into a mixed-use project. The $6.7 million renovation created 38 new apartments and it was completed in 2020. The apartments are located on the second and third floors, while the first floor is an open public gathering space.

It was built from 1884 to 1885 by Stephen Gee. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 the Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Venice= The site on which Venice stands was originally part of a 3 rods and 9 perches Crown Grant to the Church of England and Ireland. In 1882 the Church began sub-dividing the land under the name of St Marks Glebe. A Sydney solicitor, Thomas James Dickson leased Lots 1 and 2 Section 1 for the term of 99 years. The rent was A¬£13 per annum and the lessee was expected to build a solid house on the land, maintain it, pay the rates and taxes. No noxious trades were allowed for example boiling down works, slaughter house or beer house. In 1884 Dickson sold the residue of his lease to Stephen Gee a builder of Sydney for the sum of ¬£20. This amount indicates that some type of building would have been erected, most probably the stables. The deed indicates 'the parcel of land as described together with...all houses buildings, ways, paths etc...for the remainder now to come and unexpired of the said term of 99 years.' In 1889 Gee sold the residence of his lease for these 2 lots to Joseph Jonathon Dakin for the sum of ¬£120] an increase of 600% which indicates undoubtedly that Gee built this \\"gentlemans\\" residence. The annual rent fixed by the Church of England remained at ¬£13 per year. Dakin was a builder from Randwick. The Sydney Water Board map of 1891 shows water connections to all completed houses in this area of Randwick. An outline of Venice and two small buildings to the rear is shown. Also shown is a \\"fountain\\" marked on the north side of Venice to which a water connection appears. The Sands Directory of 1893 contains the first listing of a resident for No. 66 is a Mrs Nicholson and the next year a Mrs. Maquire for the next two years. It is interesting to note that the building does not appeared to have been lived in by Stephen Gee for more than six years. From 1897 to 1906 the name Venice appears in the Sands Directory with resident G.H. Holmes. It is possible that Holmes was a lessee during these 9 years. From 1909 to 1919 a number of different names are listed as residents for the ten years. In 1920 Venice is referred to for the first time in the Directory as Venice Flats with four residents listed. During this time it was altered considerably during its conversion to four self-contained units.Moore, 1989. In 1979 Venice is purchased by Dr H. M. Kalmuth for a family home and restoration is commenced in the 1980s. Following representations by the Randwick Historical Society expressing concern over the dilapidated condition of Venice an Interim Heritage Order was made over the property on 27 July 1979. At its meeting of 7 May 1981 the Heritage Council of NSW resolved to recommend that a Permanent Conservation Order should be made over the property. On 10 July 1981 the then Minister for Planning and Environment the Hon. Eric Bedford MP approved the making of a Permanent Conservation Order. An objection to the proposed Order was subsequently lodged and a Commission of Inquiry was set for 11 February 1982. Following further discussions, the objector withdrew their objection to the making of the Permanent Conservation Order. A Permanent Conservation Order was made over the property on 15 May 1982 and it was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. In 2009 funding was provided through the NSW Heritage Grants program for conservation works.Heritage Branch files.  Description  Venice is an impressive and substantial two storeyed Late Victorian gentleman's residence designed in the Gothic Revival style. The house contains a symmetrical front facade incorporating a central projecting entry bay flanked by gablets and one storey verandahs featuring elaborate timber fretwork. In plan the house is also symmetrical with a centrally placed hallway of generous proportions incorporating a grand staircase, behind which is located an intricately patterned stained glass window. The ground floor reception rooms are located either side of the hallway while to the rear right-hand side is sited the service wing. Period detailing is of a high standard throughout with diagonal chimneys, tessellated tiled path and hallway, leadlight front door, bay windows, timber wainscoting, fireplaces and elaborately moulded cornices, ceilings and roses. The resultant design is very distinctive and there is no similar house design within the Municipality of Randwick. The quality of the detailing and design suggest the use of an architect, although no conclusive evidence is available to substantiate this view. = Modifications and dates = *1884/1885 constructed *1920 converted to flats  Heritage listing  As at 19 September 2011, Venice is a comparatively rare and distinctive example of late Victorian Gothic architecture retaining most of its period detailing intact. The house and remaining garden make a notable contribution to the Frenchman Road streetscape and the early historical identity of Randwick. The house is of architectural significance to Randwick and to New South Wales. Venice was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States. Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel) * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion. PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986‚Äì2001, 2002‚Äì2009, and 2010‚Äì2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

The coupling was located approximately 15' landward from the riverbank. The pipe depth at the location of the leak was 84 inches.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2002‚Äì2009, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed January 10, 2018. * On January 26, 2002, a Northern Natural Gas Company (Enron) underwater natural gas transmission pipeline sprung a leak through a pinhole rupture due to internal corrosion in the body of a 24-inch diameter pipe manufactured in 1981. * On February 6, an 8-inch diesel pipeline was found to be leaking in Salt Lake City, Utah. About 14,600 gallons of fuel were leaked, with about 5,900 of it recovered. The cause was from external corrosion. * On February 8, a trenching machine with a new rock bit being tested hit a 20-inch diameter gas transmission pipeline in Noble County, Oklahoma, causing an explosion that killed the trencher operator. * On February 20, 2002, in a ‚Äúhigh consequence area‚Äù at Longview, Texas, a Voyageur Pipeline natural gas gathering line leaked due to bacterial corrosion causing two holes in the pipe. Twelve people were evacuated from the area as a precautionary measure. The eight-inch diameter pipe was manufactured in 1956. * On March 6, 2002, near Jeffersonville, Kentucky, a 26-inch diameter Tennessee Gas Pipeline ruptured in a compressor station yard, causing a fire and explosion that did more than $2 million in property damage. The failure originated at a manufacturing defect which caused a weld to crack. The pipe was manufactured in 1950. 30 families in the area voluntarily evacuated. There were no injuries. * On March 13, a Buckeye Partners pipeline ruptured due to internal corrosion in Wren, Ohio, spilling about 1500 gallons of gasoline. * On or about March 13, approximately 20 barrels of oil or jet fuel were discharged from a portion of the Plantation Pipeline in Alexandria, Virginia, some of which entered into an unnamed tributary of Hooff Run and its adjoining shorelines. The pipeline failure appears to have resulted from a hole in the pipeline caused by high- voltage arcing between the pipeline and a utility pole anchor. * On March 15, a failure occurred on a 36-inch gas pipeline near Crystal Falls, Michigan. The failure resulted in a release of gas, which did not ignite, that created a crater deep, wide, and long. There were no deaths or injuries. * On April 6, a BP-Amoco pipeline ruptured and released about of oil into a coastal area known as Little Lake in Louisiana. * On May 22, an 8-inch petroleum products pipeline failed, spilling about 2,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline on to a wheat field near Ottawa, Kansas. Booms had to be deployed in nearby creeks. The pipe failed along a seam, possibly due to LF-ERW pipeline failure issues. * On May 29, 2002, a Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation pipeline at Poughkeepsie, New York leaked after being punctured by a driller who struck the 12-inch diameter gas transmission line. Because it was a ‚Äúhigh consequence area,‚Äù 180 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure. * On June 20, PHMSA ordered Columbia Gas Transmission Company to do extensive repair to one of their gas transmission pipelines in the states of Pennsylvania and New York, after finding extensive wall thinning on sections of that pipeline system caused by external corrosion. Approximately 800 anomalies with wall thickness losses of greater than 65 percent were found during a smart pig examination, with 76 of the found anomalies having a wall thickness loss of greater than 80 percent. Many of the affected sections of pipe were older sections lacking coating, which is known to reduce external corrosion on pipelines. * On July 4, there was a rupture of an Enbridge Pipeline, and release of crude oil near Cohasset, Minnesota. The pipeline ruptured in a marsh in Itasca County, spilling of crude oil. In an attempt to keep the oil from contaminating the Mississippi River, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources set a controlled burn that lasted for one day and created a smoke plume about 1 mile (1.6 km) high and 5 miles (8 km) long. The pipe failed due to cracking caused by train shipping induced cracking of the pipe being delivered. * On July 22, 2002, Kinder Morgan‚Äôs KN Interstate Gas Transmission 12-inch diameter natural gas pipeline at Lodgepole, Nebraska ruptured due to galvanic corrosion on an interior seam weld. The pipe was manufactured in 1954. The instantaneous release of gas was ignited, probably by overhead electric power lines. The fire burned farm crops in vicinity of rupture along with the power pole and some power lines. * On July 24 a gas explosion leveled a Hopkinton, Massachusetts house, killing a 4-year-old girl and her 5-year-old sister. A failed sleeve on the gas line in the basement of the house was suspected of being the cause. * On August 5, a natural gas pipeline exploded and caught fire west of Rt. 622, on Poca River Road near Lanham, West Virginia. Emergency workers evacuated three or four families. Kanawha and Putnam Counties in the area were requested to shelter in place. Parts of the pipeline were thrown hundreds of yards away, around and across Poca River. The fire was not contained for several hours because valves to shut down the line did not exist. The orange glow from the fire at 11 PM; could be seen for several miles. The explosion and fire caused $2,735,339 of property damage. The Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation's 30-inch diameter pipeline ruptured due to earth movement (a landslide on an unstable slope) which stressed and buckled the steel pipe installed in 1969. * On September 20, at around 22:10 a gasoline leak from an 8-inch pipeline operated by Cenex Pipeline (terminal) was discovered near Glendive, Montana. The release of about of unleaded gasoline flowed into Seven Mile Creek, and then downstream to its confluence with the Yellowstone River. Several trenches were constructed near the ruptured pipe for product collection points. As of September 25, 2002, a vacuum truck had recovered approximately of gasoline [and water] from the boomed locations and trenches. * On October 8, 2002, in St. John The Baptist County, Louisiana, a natural gas transmission pipeline failed due to a pinhole leak in the seam of a joint in a 20-inch diameter pipe on Bridgeline Gas Distribution's Riverlands system. The pipeline was installed in 1962. The seam failure was barely visible to the naked eye. * On November 2, a Chevron pipeline ruptured near Corinne, Utah, spilling about 450 barrels of petroleum. The cause was from external corrosion. *On November 27, a construction crew had hit a gas line in Lafayette, Indiana. The first of 4 individual house explosions happened about 20 minutes later. 4 people were injured. * On December 10, a farmer plowing a field hit and ruptured a Williams Companies pipeline, near Lawrence, Kansas. About 4,700 gallons of gasoline were spilled. Later, it was noted that particular pipeline lacked soil coverage in places, including some exposed spots. There were no injuries.

Early in World War II, the ship was transferred from the FWS to the United States Navy for war service and renamed USS YP-197. Immediately transferred to the United States Coast Guard, she operated as a Coast Guard vessel from 1942 to 1945. After her NMFS service, the ship operated commercially as the dive tender MV Baja Explorador before returning to her original name. She fell into disrepair and was scuttled in late 1997 or in January 1998.  Construction and commissioning The U.S. Works Progress Administration allocated US$125,000 to the design and construction of Brown Bear for use by both the United States Department of the Interior‚Ä≤s Bureau of Biological Survey and the United States Government‚Ä≤s Alaska Game Commission.AFSC Historical Corner: Brown Bear, Grizzly Bear & Black Bear - \\"Bear\\" Boats Retrieved September 14, 2018navsource.org NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive YP-197 The Seattle, Washington, naval architect Harold Cornelius Hanson designed her specifically for biological research work. She had a heavy, wooden, sawn-fir-frame hull sheathed in ironbark and a flush deck with a long forward deck that allowed her crew and embarked scientists to work more easily in Arctic ice. She had a 100-ton cargo storage hold accessible via a hatch in her after deck. She had three separate deck levels, and spacious living space for her crew and embarked scientists was divided among the decks and included sleeping accommodations for 16 people. She carried an 18-foot (5.5-meter) tender ‚Äì stowed on deck aft of her upper deckhouse when not in use ‚Äì with a 10-horsepower (8.5-kilowatt) Kermath Marine Engines engine. The Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company built Brown Bear at Bainbridge Island, Washington, and her construction took six months. She was launched at Eagle Harbor on 7 November 1934 with a large crowd of guests from Seattle looking on. After fitting out was completed, she was commissioned into U.S. Government service. Operational history =Bureau of Biological Survey and Alaska Game Commission= Brown Bear in front of Taku Glacier in the Territory of Alaska in August 1935.In 1936, Brown Bear made history‚Ä≤s first survey of sea otters in and around the Aleutian Islands. The sea otter herd was of considerable commercial value as a source of furs, and Brown Bear‚Ä≤s survey demonstrated that the sea otters were becoming more numerous and expanding their range, dispelling fears that they were becoming extinct in the Aleutians. Brown Bear also reported sightings of foreign commercial fishing activities in Aleutian waters, something that she did during her other cruises in Alaskan waters as well. Bureau of Biological Survey biologist Olaus Murie ‚Äì accompanied by other scientists from both the Bureau and the Alaska Game Commission ‚Äì used Brown Bear from 1936 to 1938 to study resources native to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and Bering Sea. In 1939, Brown Bear transported Bureau ichthyologist and University of Michigan Curator of Fishes Dr. Carl L. Hubbs to Unalaska and the Pribilof Islands during an intensive study he made of the Territory of Alaska's fisheries and marine mammals, and in September 1939 the ship conveyed him to Seattle. =Fish and Wildlife Service (1940‚Äì1941)= Brown Bear on 5 August 1941.In 1939, the United States Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the U.S. Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Bureau of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, Brown Bear became part of the fleet of the new FWS in 1940. In 1940, Brown Bear was assigned to protect game in the Aleutian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and she spent the year patrolling the islands. During 1941, she made trips along the Aleutian Island chain as far as Attu Island at its westernmost end in support of a U.S. Government effort to explore ways of propagating sea otter populations in the Territory of Alaska. =U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard= At some point in the four weeks after the United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941, Brown Bear was transferred to the United States Navy for war service. The Navy designated her as a yard patrol vessel, renamed her USS YP-197, and transferred her to the United States Coast Guard on 5 January 1942. For her war service, she was equipped with a T-106 radio transmitter, a radio receiver, a boom, and a derrick. The Coast Guard used YP-197 to transport personnel and freight in Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. After the conclusion of the war, the Coast Guard transferred her to the Navy on 2 November 1945, and on 28 March 1946 the Navy transferred her to the FWS. =Fish and Wildlife Service (1946‚Äì1951)= Returning to her original name, Brown Bear resumed her operations for the FWS. In 1946, she was moored at the FWS pier at the north end of Lake Union in Seattle when a large fire gutted the FWS warehouse at the pier. The fire scorched Brown Bear and she narrowly escaped destruction. Brown Bear left Seattle on 3 April 1947 carrying FWS personnel to Southeast Alaska, where they worked the downstream pink salmon fry-counting weir at the FWS Little Port Walter field station at Port Walter, Territory of Alaska. After that, she served as a base of operations for the spring 1947 stream surveys headed by FWS biologist Samuel J. Hutchinson, operating skiffs with outboard motors to transport personnel between ship and shore. Upon completion of the survey in early May 1947. Brown Bear transferred the survey staff to the FWS vessel MV Brant so that they could conduct additional surveys in Alaska‚Ä≤s Ketchikan district, then departed Alaska to transport Hutchinson to Seattle. By the end of the 1940s, Brown Bear was making regular supply runs to and from Bristol Bay. Around 1950, the FWS vessel MV Dennis Winn relieved her of these duties. For six months in late 1950 and early 1951, Brown Bear operated in severe late autumn, winter, and early spring weather in the Aleutian Islands while her crew and embarked scientists studied an intestinal parasite that was killing sea otters. After completing this cruise, she arrived at Juneau, Alaska, in May 1951. =University of Washington= The U.S. Navy again requisitioned Brown Bear when she arrived at Juneau in 1951, but by the summer of 1952 the University of Washington's Department of Oceanography had acquired her. The university employed her in research projects in Alaska, off the coasts of Washington and Oregon, and in parts of the Columbia River, and she often operated in cooperation with vessels from other agencies. In 1956 and 1957, Brown Bear worked with the FWS vessels US FWS Skipjack and US FWS Teal to support a study of the estuarine circulation of water in Silver Bay, a deep-water fjord in Alaska near Sitka. Equipped with 31,000 feet (9,449 meters) of wire rope and sampling gear to allow her to make soundings in waters up to 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) deep, she made an oceanographic expedition in the summer of 1957 as part of an international project to study the Pacific Ocean, including the Aleutian Trench. In the summer of 1958, she worked with ships from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Canada to conduct a longitudinal profile survey of waters as far north as the Bering Strait, including bathymetry, bottom sampling, and chemical and physical studies of the water. In 1959 and 1960, she made cruises to conduct a comprehensive oceanographic study of the Chukchi Sea, cooperating with the Fish and Wildlife Service research vessel John N. Cobb (FWS 1601); during the 1960 cruise, she also made seabird observations. Between January and August 1965, Brown Bear made four cruises off the coasts of Washington and Oregon during which she collected physical, biological, and chemical data regarding the properties of Columbia River effluent water. =U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1965‚Äì1970) and NOAA= Port-quarter view of Brown Bear.Around 1965, Brown Bear was returned to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which in 1956 had undergone a reorganization in which it was renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and a new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) was created within it; the BCF operated USFWS seagoing ships like Brown Bear. Upon her return to the USFWS, Brown Bear thus was assigned to the BCF. On 3 October 1970, a major reorganization occurred which formed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the reorganization, the BCF was abolished and its ships were removed from the USFWS and placed under NOAA,Guinan, John A., and Ralph E. Curtis, \\"A Century Of Conservation,\\" noaa.gov, April 1971 Retrieved August 22, 2018 and ships of the BCF fleet joined those of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in forming the new NOAA fleet. At first, the major ships that were to constitute the new fleet reported to separate entities, with former Coast and Geodetic Survey ships subordinate to the National Ocean Survey (the Coast and Geodetic Survey‚Ä≤s successor organization within NOAA), while former BCF ships reported to the BCF‚Ä≤s successor within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). During 1972 and 1973, however, the ships of the National Ocean Survey and National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as those of the Environmental Research Laboratories, integrated to form a consolidated and unified NOAA fleet, operated by the National Ocean Survey‚Ä≤s Office of Fleet Operations,noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Retrieved August 23, 2018 but NOAA replaced Brown Bear before she could integrate into the unified NOAA fleet. During these years, Brown Bear operated as a \\"houseboat\\" for the USFWS and later NOAA, and hosted saltwater salmon- rearing experiments while stationed at the NOAA Manchester Biological Field Station in Puget Sound near Bremerton, Washington. She served as a floating laboratory and fish hatchery, equipped with tanks and trays for marine sampling. She had very capable facilities for studying water chemistry which allowed the circulation of fresh and salt water and its modification by temperature, filtration, aeration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. In 1972, NOAA procured a portable floating laboratory to replace Brown Bear. She was decommissioned and sold. =Later career= By 1990, Brown Bear had been renamed MV Baja Explorador and was operating in Mexico as a commercial excursion vessel and for recreational underwater diving in the waters around Baja California. By 1992 she had been sold to American owners, renamed Brown Bear, and moored at Los Angeles, California. Records suggest that she never put to sea again, except to be moved to San Diego, California, in 1994. In the meantime, she passed through a succession of owners ‚Äì Michael Brittain of Seward, Alaska, then the Alaska Oceanographic Society, then the Anderson Tug & Barge Company, and eventually R/V Brown Bear Inc. of Seward. In August 1994, she sank from neglect at San Diego, and by 1995 she apparently had broken in half. She eventually was refloated, and in late 1997 or in January 1998 she was towed to sea and scuttled in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego.

He then leads a playable or 'live' card. The other players follow in clockwise order by playing a higher card if possible; otherwise they pass. They may never discard. The player who has played the highest card wins the trick. The trick winner then plays any Sevens he has and leads a playable card. If he can do neither, he passes and the lead transfers to the player on his left. Play continues until one team takes six tricks. If a team has five tricks and the King of Clubs, they may count it as a sixth trick. If neither side takes six tricks, it is a draw and the same dealer deals again. = Scoring = One point is scored for winning six tricks. If the winners score 6‚Äì0, they have made Jan and score 2 points. Game is six points.  Footnotes   References   Literature  Dummett, Michael (1978).

Biography  Sakharov was born in the village of Nepotyagovo in the Vologda Oblast, living with his mother Galina Alexandrovna, a collective farm worker. Nikolay's father, a participant and disabled veteran, died early. At school, Nikolay was a disciplined boy, but was bad at studying. He was also a member of the Komsomol from 1969 to 1975. After eight grade, Sakharov graduated from the Kubensky SPTU, working as a tractor driver in the state farm \\"Prigorodny\\", after which he served in the army. From 1974 to 1975, he worked as a policeman in the special detention center of the Vologda International Affairs Directorate, where he was fired \\"for his connection with the arrested.\\"–ó–∞ –¥–µ–Ω—å–≥–∏ –ø–æ–∫—É–ø–∞–ª –∏–º —á–∞–π –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —á–∏—Ñ–∏—Ä—è He could not find work in Selhoztechnik for a long time, after which he changed many times. Later he began to work as a prison supervisor, but was dismissed on October 25, 1977 for discipline violations. At the same time, Sakharov discovered how to attract women, and had many mistresses. He was also married, but not for long. His ex-wife said that she had divorced him because of his jealousy, and Sakharov himself did not hesitate to have sex with other women, not hiding his betrayals. The first rape and murder he committed occurred in January 1977, which spread rumors, fear and panic in the city. Girls began disappearing without a trace: in total, 5 cases of missing girls were recorded. People in the city exaggerated the number of victims, saying that dozens had disappeared, which increased the hysteria. The police did not want this to go on for a long time, and created a special investigative group headed by the senior investigator of the regional prosecutor's office, Vladimir Dorofeev. Sakharov knew that they were looking for him, but this did not stop his thirst to kill, with the last disappearance occurring in November in the village of Maisky. There were witnesses who saw the girl get into a Moskvich-403, which was the first important clue. Lookouts were organized around the roads, and on December 15, Sakharov was arrested by a patrol police car. On January 25, 1978, Sakharov confessed to the murder of three girls (Tatyana Svetina, Natalia Vinogradova and Marina Mukhina). Having a car, he scoured in search of victims around the city and the surrounding area. If he met a lonely young girl on the road, he offered her a ride, most often dressed in a police uniform. When the girl got into the car, he took her out of town, into the woods, raped her (according to his confession, he raped two of the girls, but the third he could not), killing them by hitting them with a hammer, driftwood or tuning key. Then Sakharov burned the corpses, shattering the skulls with a big stick, wrapping the remains in a rag and throwing them into the river. The remains of two of his victims were thrown into the Pelshma River, but he burned the corpses in the forest near Kadnikov. He stole a watch and handkerchief from the second victim, giving them to one of his mistresses, and from the third - a cross and \\"chain of yellow metal\\", which he gave to another mistress. This chain, seized during the investigation, also helped convict the offender. In February 1978, he tried to escape from prison, but was prevented from doing so. = Trial = From July 18 to 25, 1978, a court was held in Vologda. The judge in the case was well-known Vologda lawyer Yuri Koshkin. Together with Sakharov at the dock were three of his accomplices. They committed a series of thefts with him, but none participated in the murders. Even before the trial there was an agreement with the escort regiment on the allocation of special protection and reinforced police outfits. In the city there was talk that the population was aroused, and a lynching could occur. In those days, crowds of people went to the courthouse. The participants of the trial and the judges could enter the building with great difficulty. On the porch, speakers were installed (an unprecedented case at the time). Through them people were told to be calm and to not interfere in the process. At the trial, Sakharov detailed all his crimes, fully admitting his guilt and asking the court not sentence him to death. However, the request was denied, and Nikolay Sakharov was executed by firing squad on February 5, 1979. = In the media = * Documentary film from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" - \\"In bed with a murderer\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References   External links  * Vladimir Arinin.

The film stars Steve Coogan, David Mitchell, Asa Butterfield, Dinita Gohil, Sophie Cookson, Jonny Sweet, Asim Chaudhry, Shirley Henderson and Isla Fisher. The film centres around Sir Richard McCreadie, played by Coogan, a billionaire high-street fashion mogul loosely based on Arcadia Group chairman Philip Greenhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51488884, and events surrounding the build-up to his 60th birthday celebrations on the Greek island of Mykonos. Greed had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2019, and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2020 by Sony Pictures Releasing International. Plot The film takes a non-linear approach to the life of Sir Richard \\"Greedy\\" McCreadie, a billionaire fashion mogul, with frequent flashbacks to his rise from relatively humble (though still affluent and privileged) circumstances as an outcast and rebellious student at an unnamed British public school, to his rise in the 1970s and 1980s as a powerful high-street fashion merchant, to his testimony at a recent government hearing on financial and ethical abuses within the fashion industry. It becomes clear that, despite McCreadie's self- image as a hard-nosed and savvy businessman with multiple celebrity friends, much of his wealth is in fact based on ruthless exploitation, including a reliance on sweatshops in Southeast Asia for his fashion lines, tax avoidance, asset stripping and similar questionably ethical financial dealings. Much of the film focuses on the build-up to McCreadie's 60th birthday party, a Gladiator-themed celebration on the island of Mykonos which McCreadie hopes will settle his nerves after his disastrous and publicly-damaging performance at the government hearing. To further help restore his reputation, he has hired Nick, a socially-awkward journalist, to ghostwrite a flattering memoir for him. However, even there matters are not progressing smoothly; the centrepiece of the celebrations, a Roman arena where a mock-gladiatorial fight against a lion will be staged, is poorly-constructed due to lax local builders who rely mainly on undocumented immigrant labour, and the lion itself is quite passive, much to McCreadie's annoyance. Furthermore, many of McCreadie's celebrity guests are distancing themselves from him due to the damage to his reputation, and a crowd of Syrian refugees have constructed a makeshift camp on the public beach adjoining his property and refuse to leave. Tensions also exist among his family, including his ex-wife Samantha, who acts as the public CEO of his family and for whom he continues to have lingering attraction despite having subsequently married a much younger trophy wife; his daughter Lily, who is starring in a reality TV show being filmed alongside the celebrations with her boyfriend Fabian; and his neglected son Finn, who holds an Oedipal obsession with replacing his father. As he writes the memoir, Nick struggles with his job of whitewashing McCreadie's public image in light of both his unethical business practices and, on a personal level, his uncouth and bullying personality. He begins to form a friendship with Amanda, one of McCreadie's personal assistants, who is also struggling with the ethical dilemmas of working for McCreadie. After breaking down when McCreadie reveals that he wants his employees to wear Roman slave outfits to his party, Amanda reveals to Nick that her mother was an employee in one of McCreadie's sweatshops in Southeast Asia, but was fired by the manager when she was no longer physically able to work to McCreadie's requirements. She was subsequently killed after being forced to work in another sweatshop which eventually caught fire due to a lack of safety precautions. On the night of the party, McCreadie cons the Syrian refugees into working for him with a three card monte trick after his local employees down tools. During the lavish celebrations, some of the refugee children steal silverware and are confronted by McCreadie's employees, but Amanda manages to persuade their father to return the stolen items. Simultaneously, Finn steals some cocaine from McCreadie's trophy wife Naomi and doses the lion's food with it. After his advances are rejected by Samantha, McCreadie drunkenly wanders into the arena and encounters the lion in its cage. Amanda, crossing paths with him, on impulse releases the lion, which mauls McCreadie to death in a drugged frenzy. Nick witnesses these events in horror, but helps Amanda escape without being discovered. Following McCreadie's death, he becomes subject to numerous flattering eulogies, and Nick's project becomes a hagiographic biography. Finn takes over his father's role in the business, and it is implied that he will be just as ruthless if not worse. Nick and Amanda meet, and agree to keep Amanda's role in McCreadie's death secret; Amanda tells Nick that she views her action as justified and not so different from the indirect role McCreadie played in her mother's death. Amanda goes to work at her new job‚Äîsewing at a Leicester sweatshop. The film ends with facts about exploitation and inequality within the fashion industry being shown over the credits. Cast Production It was announced in November 2016 that Fox Searchlight was looking to acquire the distribution rights to the film, with Michael Winterbottom set as director and Sacha Baron Cohen cast.

Biography  Stepan Protsiuk was born on 13 August 1964 in small village Kuty in Lviv Oblast of Ukrainian SSR. His parents were school teachers, and his father was a political prisoner who was sentenced for anti-Soviet propaganda before Stepan's birth. Shortly after his birth, Protsiuk's parents moved to Ivano- Frankivsk Oblast. Stepan Protsiuk studied in Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University and obtained a PhD (Candidate of Sciences) degree in philology in the Institute of Literature of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Since the early 1990s, he has been living in Ivano-Frankivsk and teaching Ukrainian literature at the Precarpathian National University alongside with his writing career. Stepan Protsiuk is a member the Ukrainian center of PEN International. Protsiuk was a member of National Writers' Union of Ukraine since 1995 until he quit the organization in 2017, claiming that he had \\"different views on the development of the Ukrainian literature\\". Protsiuk is married, he is a father to two sons. He currently lives in Ivano-Frankivsk.  Literary works  Stepan Protsiuk started his literary career as a poet in the early 1990s. Along with Ivan Tsyperdiuk and Ivan Andrusiak, he founded poetic group New Degeneration, which was among the most famous Ukrainian poetic groups in the early 1990s. New Degeneration created a controversy among prominent Ukrainian writers and literary critics as, for example, Oles Honchar criticized the group's approach to literature, while Lina Kostenko praised it. In 1992, the group published their first book New Degeneration (foreword by Yurii Andrukhovych), which included Protsiuk's collection of poems titled At the Edge of Two Truths. New Degeneration was active until the mid-1990s. In the late 1990s, Stepan Protsiuk stopped writing poetry and gradually switched to prose works. His first novel Infection, which is one of his most famous works, was published in 2002 and devoted to social and psychological issues, being set in 20th-century Ukraine. Protsiuk received both praise and criticism for his depiction of national and mental problems of Ukrainians. In his works, Protsiuk explores various social problems facing Ukraine today (Infection) or in the past (Tenth Line, The Grass Cannot Die), as well as existential problems, such as individual and collective being (Destruction of a Doll) or relationship between parents and children (Hit Your Head against the Wall). His literary style has been described as a mix of postmodernism and neo avant- garde. In the late 2000s, Protsiuk debuted with his novels for children. First novel, Mariyka and Kostyk, was followed by two sequels, In Love with the Sun and Argonauts. All of them were published in Kyiv-based publishing house Grani-T. Protsiuk also authored three books for children published in Vinnytsia-based publishing house Teza. Protsiuk is also known for his fiction novels devoted to prominent Ukrainian writers ‚Äì Vasyl Stefanyk (The Rose of Ritual Pain), Volodymyr Vynnychenko (Masks Fall off Slowly), Arhip Teslenko (Black Apple). Protsiuk's major books include: * At the Edge of Two Truths (, 1992; part of book New Degeneration, foreword by Yurii Andrukhovych), a book of poems. * Always and Never (, 1999), a book of poems. * Infection (, 2002), a novel. * Totem (, 2005), a novel. * Sacrifice (, 2007), a novel. * Tightrope Walkers (, 2007), a book of essays. * Destruction of a Doll (, 2010), a novel. * Blood Test (, 2010), a book of essays. * The Rose of Ritual Pain (, 2010), a novel. * Masks Fall off Slowly (, 2011), a novel. * Black Apple (, 2011), a novel. * Hit Your Head against the Wall (, 2011), a novel. * Tenth Line (, 2014), a novel. * Under the Wings of the Great Mother (, 2015), a novel. * The Grass Cannot Die (, 2017), a novel.  Awards and recognition  Stepan Protsiuk is widely considered to be among the most controversial Ukrainian intellectual writers. He is the 2015 winner of the \\"Golden Ukrainian Writers\\" award for the largest circulation of books in Ukraine. Protsiuk's novels Infection and Tenth line were nominated for Shevchenko National Prize in 2003 and 2016, respectively. Apart from nationwide awards, Protsiuk received various local awards in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, such as Ivan Franko Literary Award (2002) and Vasyl Stefanyk Literary Award (2003). Protsiuk's works have been translated into several languages. In late 2008, Protsiuk's novel Totem was published in the Azerbaijani language in publishing house Vektor in Baku. His short stories and poems have been translated into the German, Russian, Slovak, Polish, Czech, and French languages. Protsiuk's presentation were held in dozens of Ukrainian cities, as well as in Chicago (in Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art), New York, Rome (in the Embassy of Ukraine), Paris, Berlin, Helsinki, Krak√≥w and other cities. Several works by Stepan Protsiuk are included in the list of literature recommended for reading in middle and high school in Ukraine. Along with several other poetic groups created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, group New Degeneration co-founded by Protsiuk is included in the program of External independent evaluation, the statewide test used for admission to universities. Protsiuk's books for teenagers are recommended for reading in 7th grade, while his novel Infection is recommended for students of 11th grade. Protsiuk's literary legacy is the subject of two scholarly books (by Bohdan Pastuh and Oleh Solovey), one play based on Protsiuk's novel Infection (Tetiana Kinzerska), and numerous scientific and journalist articles.

With a net tonnage of 40 tons, she was able to carry about 300 passengers. She was lost on 3 August, 1885 due to fire while docked in Toronto. The boilers of the Annie Craig were salvaged. Career in Lake Erie For three seasons she operated on Lake Erie from Port Dover. On 30 Sept 1880 she carried the Governor General and suite to the Long Point Company's shooting grounds. American middleweight boxers were planning an illegal match at Long Point, ON. The Annie Craig transported Norfolk Sheriff Deedes and other forces to Long Point. They were successful in persuading the Americans to return to Erie and Buffalo. Humber Steam Ferry The Annie Craig was purchased in 1882 by the Humber Steam Ferry Co. Three hotel owners (John Duck, Octavius Hicks and Charles Nurse) plus a brewer Eugene O'Keefe were the owners of the ferry company. The hotels were located in Etobicoke Township at the mouth of the Humber River. Access from Toronto was difficult as the streetcar lines did not extend that far west. Initially passengers were carried from a wharf near Yonge Street to John Duck's dock with an intermediate stop at the foot of Bathurst St. The 1885 route had intermediate stops at the Exhibition Grounds and High Park. \\"Captain Fred. Twitchell was charged with desecrating the Sabbath by running his boat, the Annie Craig.\\" Twitchell was discharged when the complainant failed to appear. On 11 October Twitchell made his final appearance on a charge of Sabbath violation and was fined $1. The Twitchell case did not deter operations of the ferry company. The loss of the Annie Craig in 1885 eventually led to the shutdown of the ferry company in July 1886. In 1886, Doty Bros operated the \\"palace steamers\\" Queen City and Canadian to High Park and Humber. \\"The steamer Canadian, which ran on the Humber route last season, has been sold to Mr Robert Davies, who will fit her out to run to Victoria Park and vicinity.\\" Davies also chartered the Gertrude and operated for ships to Victoria Park and Humber for summer 1887. Steamer service to the Humber then ended. The only public transport available was the Grand Trunk Railway until the Toronto and Mimico Electric Railway and Light Company began service from Sunnyside to the Humber in 1892.

Career Pearl McGown learned rug-hooking as a child. Hooked rugs are made by pulling loops of yarn or thin strips of fabric through a base material with an open weave, typically burlap or linen. In North America, rug-hooking has been a widespread handicraft since the early 19th century, possibly brought over by English textile workers. Like patchwork quilts, hooked rugs have historically been primarily made by women as functional decorative objects that use up remnants from other sewing, knitting, or weaving projects. Although a few professional designers took an interest in hooked rugs during the late 19th century Arts and Crafts era, they remained associated with poverty and did not enjoy the same degree of aesthetic development as other handicrafts in that period. In the late 1920s, McGown began designing and selling her own patterns to students of a Massachusetts hooked rug teacher, Caroline Saunders. Her business flourished and became national in scope, and she eventually hired several helpers. All told, she created over 1000 original designs during her career. She began making rugs herself (now sought by collectors) and became known for floral designs that employ many subtle shades of color to create rich detail and striking pictorial effects. In the 1930s, McGown began writing books on the techniques of rug-hooking as well as on patterns and color schemes. She also began offering workshops in wool dying to obtain the shades needed for specific projects. Through her books and dye workshops, she championed rug- hooking's evolution from a plain craft to a folk art, insisting on high standards of fabrication and steering her students away from commercial patterns towards more personalized designs. In 1940, McGown organized an exhibition of hooked rugs that became an annual event. During World War II, she began a newsletter, Letter Service, that offered instruction in special techniques, and she also taught rug-hooking to servicemen recuperating in military hospitals. In 1951, McGown organized the first in what became an annual series of hooked rug workshops to train new teachers, exchange knowledge, and develop the formal study of hooked rugs and their history. The McGown Teacher Workshops, as they became known, centered on McGown's own patterns, which consequently became widely known. In 1970, McGown sold her business to Old Sturbridge Village, and it was later sold again to the dye manufacturer W. Cushing & Co. Today, there is still a Pearl K. McGown Teacher Certification and Workshop Program under different owners. McGown also created the first known correspondence course for those who wanted to teach rug- hooking to others. Some of McGown's work is in the Hooked Rug Museum of North America in Nova Scotia, Canada.

The creditor country intentionally extends excessive credit to a debtor country, thereby inducing the debtor into a debt trap. This is done with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions from the debtor country when it becomes unable to honour its debt. The conditions of the loans are often not made public, and the borrowed money commonly pays contractors from the creditor country. Although the term has been applied to the lending practices of many countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is, , most commonly associated with the People's Republic of China (PRC). Bilateral agreements made as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative have furthered this association, especially regarding commodity-backed loans to developing nations.  Origin The term \\"debt-trap diplomacy\\" was coined by Brahma Chellaney to describe China's predatory lending practices in which poor countries are overwhelmed with unsustainable loans and would be forced to cede control of strategic assets to China. The term was first used in 2017; within 12 months it had quickly spread through the media, intelligence circles, and western governments. It has since expanded to include other parts of the world and was further defined and expanded upon in the context of Chinese geostrategic interests in a 2018 Harvard University report. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multi- billion-dollar expansion project of China, to expand its power through lending to countries to spur their economic growth. The BRI project was launched in 2013 by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to improve the infrastructure of countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia in exchange for global trade opportunities and economic advantage. International reaction =Criticism of China= Studies of economic experts in the practices of China found the patterns of China's bank lending purposefully trap governments to gain strategic opportunities for China. According to Chellaney, this \\"clearly part of China's geostrategic vision\\". China's overseas development policy has been called debt-trap diplomacy because once indebted economies fail to service their loans, they are said to be pressured to support China's geostrategic interests. Some commentators maintain China is supporting repressive regimes in a neocolonialist manner through high-interest loans, intending to coerce these countries, once they default, to align with China on key strategic and military issues. China has been accused of requiring secret negotiations and non-competitive pricing on projects in which bidding must be closed and contracts must go to Chinese state-owned or state-linked companies that charge significantly higher prices than would be charged on the open market. Western, Indian, and African media have criticized China's secretive loan terms and high interest rates. For example, a 2006 loan to Tonga sought to rebuild infrastructure. From 2013 to 2014, Tonga suffered a debt crisis when the Exim Bank of China, to which the loans are owed, did not forgive them. The loans claimed 44 percent of Tonga's gross domestic product (GDP). Western analysts have said China's practices may hide hegemonic intentions and challenges to states' sovereignty. China has also been accused of imposing unfair trade and financial deals when cash-poor countries are unable to resist Beijing's money. =Criticism of the term= A SAIS-CARI report from August 2018 found \\"Chinese loans are not currently a major contributor to debt distress in Africa. Yet many countries have borrowed heavily from China and others. Any new [Forum on China‚ÄìAfrica Cooperation (FOCAC)] loan pledges will likely take the growing debt burden of African countries into account.\\" A 2019 peer-reviewed Johns Hopkins research paper by Deborah Brautigam found \\"the evidence so far, including the Sri Lankan case, shows that the drumbeat of alarm about Chinese banks' funding of infrastructure across the BRI and beyond is overblown\\". The Rhodium Group has stated China's leverage in debt renegotiation is often exaggerated and was realistically limited in power, and that the findings of their study frequently showed an outcome in favor of the borrower rather than the supposedly predatory Chinese lender. A May 2019 article in the Sydney Morning Herald said the term was being questioned by new research; an analysis of 40 Chinese debt re-negotiations by the Rhodium Group found \\"asset seizures are a very rare occurrence\\" and that debt write-off is the most common outcome. The article also reported the views of Australian National University senior lecturer Darren Lim, who, referring to the Rhodium Group study, said much of the leverage shifts to the borrower rather than the lender after the loan has been made. Lim said despite the debt-trap diplomacy claim never being credible, it been pushed by the Trump administration. A report by the Lowy Institute said China had not engaged in deliberate actions in the Pacific that can justify the accusations of debt-trap diplomacy, at least based on contemporaneous evidence, and stated China has not been the primary driver behind rising debt risks in the Pacific but warned the scale of its lending and the institutional weakness within Pacific states would pose risks of small states being overwhelmed by debt. Other critics include Chinese state-owned newspaper Global Times and Rwandan President Paul Kagame.  Africa  China is a major stakeholder in the economies of many African countries with a significant influence on many aspects of the continent's affairs. Recently, African countries have rapidly increased their borrowing from China. According to research conducted as part of the Jubilee Debt Campaign in October 2018, African countries owed China US$10 billion in 2010, increasing to over $30 billion by 2016. China's lending to African countries is part of a large-scale overseas investment boom, forming part of its quest to secure access to raw materials and become an economic superpower. , the countries in Africa with the largest Chinese debt are Angola ($25 billion), Ethiopia ($13.5 billion), Zambia ($7.4 billion), the Republic of Congo ($7.3 billion), and Sudan ($6.4 billion). In total the Chinese have loaned US$143 billion to African governments and state owned enterprises between 2000 and 2017. = Infrastructure = Several infrastructure projects funded by Chinese loans are thought to have had a positive impact on the economies of many African countries via developments in infrastructure. Infrastructure improved with these loans includes roads, railways, and ports. Improved infrastructure favors internal trade, healthcare, and education systems. One example of infrastructure development is the Merowe Dam in Sudan to produce hydroelectric power. In the 2015 and 2017 records of World Bank, several African countries have large debts with China and other creditor nations. Interest rates of about 55% in the private sector prompted some African countries to go to China for loans, which charges around 17%. The debts of African countries to China paid for the investment in sectors needing critical development and growth. In exchange, China in demands payment in the form of jobs and natural resources. = Economic risks = The risks involved in borrowing countries are unexpectedly high. In recent news, many countries in the BRI project have started rethinking the project and most have repayment issues. According to Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, there is more to these projects than financial strategy; \\"It's also a vehicle for China to write new rules, establish institutions that reflect Chinese interests, and reshape 'soft' infrastructure\\". The negative effects of Chinese loans to African economies include fear of losing local companies to Chinese companies with strong buying power. Debt from China has promoted illicit trade among China and African countries; such imports are cheap because of China's low-cost labor and are preferred to locally manufactured goods, for example, clothing and electronics. Trade between African countries and China has also affected ties between African countries and other continents, especially Europe and North America. According to Deborah Brautigam, Chinese loans are prone to misuse, and have promoted the levels of corruption and fights for power in African countries. Over four-fifths of China's investments are spent on infrastructure projects in underdeveloped and developing countries. Forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show the economic growth-rate of China will fall to around 6.2%, which is around 0.4% less than in 2018. Reason for the decline are the increasing number of trade disputes between China and the US, and the sudden increase in debt in the past decade, which was used for infrastructure programs. = Kenya = Between 2006 and 2017, Kenya took out loans of at least US$9.8 billion (Sh1043.77 billion) from China. Chinese debt accounts for 72% of Kenya's foreign debt. China lent Kenya extensive funds to build highways and a railway between Mombasa and Nairobi, totaling over US$6.5 billion as of 2020. In late December 2018, Kenya reportedly came close to default on Chinese loans to develop its largest and most lucrative port, the Port of Mombasa. A default could have forced Kenya to relinquish control of the port to China. Kenyan media has debated whether Chinese loans are worth the risk, drawing analogies with the experience of ; some commentators have said these loans could jeopardize Kenyan sovereignty. = South Africa = South Africa is estimated to owe the equivalent of 4% of its annual GDP to China. South Africa has received multiple tranches of Chinese loans, some of which have raised concerns around their opaque conditions and alleged links to corruption in South Africa. This includes a controversial US$2.5 billion loan from the Chinese Development Bank to state-owned South African electrical utility Eskom that was arranged during the Jacob Zuma government, the conditions of which were not made public. Another US$2.5 billion loan from a private Chinese company Huarong Energy to Eskom was found by the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state corruption to be improper, prompting Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza to state Eskom would not be repaying the loan due to irregularities and corruption involved in the issuing of it. An additional R370 billion (US$25.8 billion) loan from the China Development Bank during the presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa was given to promote a 2018 economic stimulus package. The South African government initially described the loan as a \\"gift\\"; the details of the loan were not made public, causing significant public controversy. The government justified the loan by stating the interest rate was not exorbitant and that it could not be disclosed due to confidentiality clauses. The loan was criticized by the opposition Democratic Alliance political party for possibly pushing the country into a \\"debt trap\\". = Rest of Africa = *Nigeria: US$3.1 billion of the country's total US$27.6 billion foreign debt is owned by China. Nigerian financial publication Nairametrics warned of falling into a Chinese debt trap given Nigeria's notable problems with corruption. *Zambia: US$7.4 billion of the country's total US$8.7 billion of debt is owned by China, a large debt burden given the relatively small size of Zambia's economy. In 2018, Zambian lawmakers debated whether Chinese loans put Zambian sovereignty at risk. The Zambian government was in talks with China about its total surrender of the state electricity company ZESCO as debt repayment, having defaulted on multiple Chinese loans for infrastructure projects. *Djibouti: Loans to develop a strategic port. Chinese loans total 77% of the country's total debt. Djibouti owes over 80 percent of its GDP to China and in 2017, became host to China's first overseas military base. *Republic of the Congo: an estimated $2.5billion is owed to Chinese lenders. The exact number is unknown even to the Congolese government. *Egypt: China is financing the country's new capital. In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned enterprise overseeing the new capital, criticized American reluctance to invest in Egypt, saying; \\"Stop talking to us about human rights. Come and do business with us. The Chinese are coming‚Äîthey are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\\" Latin America An article in CNBC said Chinese investment in Latin America has been burgeoning and that the project has been heavily criticized amid allegations of debt-trap diplomacy and neocolonialism. These concerns have been pronounced, especially in Venezuela and Ecuador. *Argentina: Argentina has been denied access and oversight of a Chinese satellite tracking station on its territory. *Ecuador: Ecuador has agreed to sell 80-to-90 percent of its crude oil to China through 2024 in exchange for US$6.5 billion in Chinese loans. *Venezuela: an article published by Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy said China's loans in Venezuela are not debt-trap diplomacy nor \\"creditor imperialism\\", but simply \\"lose-lose\\" financial mistakes in which both parties stand to lose. An article in Quartz summarized the Carnegie article; \\"counter to the dominant narrative about Chinese debt ensnaring other countries, the country that needs to fear excessive and unsustainable Chinese lending the most is China\\". Asia  = Sri Lanka = Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka have been cited as an example of debt-trap diplomacy, after Sri Lanka defaulted and subsequently gave a 99-year lease to China in place of payment. Critics cite the example of a loan given to the Sri Lankan government by the Exim Bank of China to build Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port and Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport as an example of debt-trap diplomacy. The state-owned Chinese firms China Harbour Engineering Company and Sinohydro Corporation were hired to build Magampura Port for US$361 million, which was 85% funded by Exim Bank of China at an annual interest rate of 6.3%. Due to Sri Lanka's inability to service the debt on the port, it was leased to the Chinese state-owned China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited on a 99-year lease in 2017. This caused concern in the United States, Japan, and India that the port might be used as a Chinese naval base to contain China's geopolitical rivals. = Pakistan = As per State Bank of Pakistan data, Pakistan's debt to China was $7.2 billion in 2017, which had increased to $19 billion in April 2018 and $30 billion in 2020, mostly due to borrowings to fund the CPEC project. Experts have estimated that Pakistan would take nearly 40 years to pay back this debt to China. A number of scholars have stated that the CPEC \\"subordinates Pakistan's interests to China's\\" and argued that the CPEC and the resultant debt and economic dependence on China would become a threat to Pakistan's sovereignty. Additionally, in 2017 China and Pakistan entered into an agreement to build 5 hydropower projects with China investing $50 billion in these. According to Hassan Abbas a Pakistani-American scholar and academic in the field of South Asian and Middle Eastern studies, project delays are likely to cause costs to escalate to $98 billion. With the accumulated interest of almost $5 billion per year, Pakistan would have to pay almost $200 billion over 20 years to China and the hydro debt will give the Chinese an upper hand in Pakistan‚Äôs affairs. = Malaysia = China financed $22 billion worth of projects in Malaysia during the leadership of Prime Minister Najib Razak. On 31 May 2014, Razak made a state visit to China, during which he was welcomed by China's Premier Li Keqiang. China and Malaysia pledged to increase bilateral trade to US$160 billion by 2017, and to increase economic and financial co-operation, especially in the production of halal food, water processing, railway construction, and ports. After his inauguration in 2018, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad cancelled projects worth approximately $2.795 billion with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau for oil and gas pipelines, saying Malaysia would not be able to repay its obligations. Ninety percent of the cost of several of the pipelines in Borneo and from Malacca to Johor had been paid but only 13% of the construction had been completed. Mohamad also stated some of the funding from the Exim Bank of China had been misappropriated as part of the 1MDB scandal. Mohamad and his Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng criticized the projects, saying they were expensive, unnecessary, not useful, uncompetitive because open bidding was not allowed, secretive, conducted with no public oversight, and favored Chinese state-owned firms and those affiliated with Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party at inflated prices. Locals in Malacca City also complained the port was unneeded and that the small company that was awarded the contract had ties to the previously-ruling UMNO political party. When confronted with the China's String of Pearls strategy in the Indian Ocean, and China's motives in Malaysia and the Strait of Malacca, Malaysian Deputy Minister of Defense Liew Chin Tong said: > You look at a map and you can see the places where China is plotting ports > and investments, from Myanmar to Pakistan to Sri Lanka, on toward Djibouti. > What's crucial to all that? Our little Malaysia, and the Malacca Strait. I > say publicly that we do not want to see warships in the Strait of Malacca or > the South China Sea.\\" The loans and their terms were later renegotiated and Mahathir Mohamad pledged support for the BRI and became one of the key opening speakers of the BRI Summit in Beijing in 2019. = Maldives = In December 2019, the Speaker of the Maldives' parliament, the People's Majlis, and former President Mohamed Nasheed said Maldives owed China $3.5 billion in loans, which included $1.5 billion in government-to-government loans, private loans, and sovereign guarantees. He said the Chinese debt trap was an economic and human-rights issue, and an issue of sovereignty and freedom of the island nation. Nasheed has also said that the project costs were inflated and the debt on paper is far greater than the $1.1bn actually received. = Tajikistan = In 2011, Tajikistan had to cede about 1000 square kilometres of land to China in exchange for waiver of outstanding debt of hundreds of millions of dollars. Other countries  China have made loans to Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Tajikistan, and Mongolia, and to build a national highway in Montenegro, as part of the BRI. It has also made US$19 billion worth of loans to Pakistan as part of the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other projects. In December 2018, New York Times reported on emerging military dimensions of the investments, which it termed a debt-trap, and stated are under poor governance and transparency. China also made a US$115 million loan to Tonga to redevelop its infrastructure, and US$2 billion in loans to Papua New Guinea totaling almost a quarter of its national debt.

It is often known by the common name Argentinian silverside or pejerrey (the latter is of Spanish origin), but it is not the only species of silverside in Argentina and pejerrey is also used for many other silversides. It is a commercially important species and the target of major fisheries. O. bonariensis resembles the other species in the genus Odontesthes, but it is larger, generally reaching up to in total length, and exceptionally as much as long and in weight (reports of even larger are unconfirmed and questionable). Range, habitat and status Odontesthes bonariensis is native to subtropical and temperate South America east of the Andes where it ranges from around the R√≠o Negro basin in Argentina, north throughout most of the northern half of that country, to the R√≠o de la Plata Basin in south Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. In coastal Atlantic parts of South America it ranges at least from the southernmost Buenos Aires Province in Argentina to Rio Grande do Sul State (Lagoa dos Patos) in Brazil. It has been introduced to many places outside its native range, including Argentina (in parts of the country where not native), Bolivia, Brazil (in parts of the country where not native), Chile, Peru, Morocco (where probably not established), Italy (only Lake Nemi), Israel (failed to become established) and Japan. O. bonariensis is highly adaptable and can live in a wide range of habitats. This includes both stagnant and flowing waters, such as rivers, streams, channels, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries and coastal lagoons. In much of its range it is particularly common in Pampas lakes that generally are less than deep. The species is able to live in fresh, brackish and salt water (salinity up to 3.5%), but not in hypersaline conditions. The water temperature can range at least from ; in short periods they can even survive in waters where the surface has frozen. Temperatures of are lethal to most individuals, and when above they often perish due to increases of the parasitic Lernaea copepods (also a primary reason for failed introduction attempts of O. bonariensis in some countries), the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila and algal blooms. Overall the species is widespread and common, but global warming can increase the temperature and salinity in some placed inhabited by O. bonariensis, representing a threat to these local populations. Behavior =Breeding= The growth rate of O. bonariensis is quite fast: They are typically around long when one year old, when two, when three, when four and when five years. They first reach maturity when 1‚Äì2 years old. Males are mature from a length of about and females from about . Most females spawn in March and April, but a smaller number also spawn from August to November (occasionally December) when the water temperatures typically is between . Even short periods where the water is more than during the spawning season can prevent the adults from breeding. Some females that spawn in August‚ÄìSeptember may spawn a second time in the same season in October‚ÄìDecember. In theory, a female has the potential to spawn at least five times during her life. In each spawning a female can typically lay more than 10,000 eggs, but the full range reported in the species is from 1,170 to 30,300 eggs, with large and old females producing more than smaller and younger. The eggs are laid in shallow water in clusters attached to submerged macrophytes. The eggs hatch into fish larvae after around 13‚Äì14 days. The growth of the larvae is negligible at temperatures of or less, and they die at . As known from some other Neotropical silversides, the temperature determines the sex in O. bonariensis. When the larvae and juveniles grow up in water that is or colder, all become females. At higher temperatures the percentage of males gradually increases, and at or warmer most become males. The larvae are unable to survive salinities of 3% (they thrive from 2% to pure fresh water), but they can already live at this relatively high range once they reach the juvenile stage. Hybridization with other species in the genus Odontesthes has occurred both in captivity and the wild. =Feeding= In the first part of their life O. bonariensis mostly feed on zooplankton. When reaching around long they start to mainly feed on insects; both aquatic insect larvae and land insects that fall into the water. From an age of around 4 years they become more piscivorous, even cannibalising young of their own species. Other food items recorded in lower quantities are shrimp, snails and plants (algae and seeds). In captivity they will eat commercially available dry pellets developed for feeding trout. Fishing and as an invasive species This species is considered an excellent food fish, and it is of major economic importance in both its native range and where introduced. Many thousand tonnes are caught each year. It is also considered a good game fish. It is sometimes kept in aquaculture due to its ability to live in a wide range of environments, the ease of breeding it in captivity and its fast growth. In Lake Titicaca where introduced they are typically caught when around long and in weight, but those caught in its native Argentina typically are around long and weigh . However, some populations, notably the one in Lake Titicaca, contain levels of metals from pollution that exceed the internationally recommended safety thresholds for human consumption. Although it has significantly aided the local economy in many places where introduced, it has become invasive in some places, causing serious problems to the native species. It is one of the causes of the major declines in Orestias pupfish and Trichomycterus catfish in Bolivia, Peru (notably Lake Titicaca where O. cuvieri has become extinct and relatives declined) and Chile. Another vulnerable habitat where it has been introduced is the Iguazu River at the Argentina‚ÄìBrazil border. Odontesthes hatcheri replaces O. bonariensis in the southern half of Argentina (roughly equalling Patagonia), but the latter has been translocated to certain southern regions where the two hybridize. This offspring is viable and some native populations of O. hatcheri have become \\"diluted\\".

Because of increasing automation and the low price of maintaining an automated workforce compare to one dependent on human labour it has also been suggested that post-work societies would also be ones of post-scarcity.

Her career began during the Golden Age of Television in the 1950s and continued on stage and in film into the first decade of the 21st century. Background Born Beverly Claire Rentz in Atlanta, Georgia, her parents divorced when she was young, and she moved with her mother to Florida. She studied drama at Sarasota High School, but was forced to leave school at age 16 to move again to Pensacola. It was there while working in a diner that she met entertainer Arthur Godfrey, who was a Reservist at a nearby naval station. Career Rentz later moved to New York City and searched for Godfrey. He asked her to appear regularly on his show, where she became a \\"Little Godfrey\\" who held up signs for commercials. Godfrey introduced her as \\"Beverly Bentley\\", because he thought the name \\"sounds better\\". She then changed her name professionally. She briefly married advertising executive Alex Mumford and worked as hostess and fashion commentator on several TV game shows, such as Beat the Clock, The Big Payoff, and The Price Is Right. She also worked as a \\"hand model\\" for perfume commercials, had been to Ernest Hemingway's birthday party in Spain, and had celebrity boyfriends, including Orson Bean, Eddie Fisher, Andy Griffith, and Miles Davis. In due time, she had her first off-Broadway role as Connie Bliss in Clifford Odets' The Big Knife, in which she starred opposite James Earl Jones. With director Leo Garen, Bentley founded Act IV in Provincetown, a small theater company that staged plays by Pirandello, LeRoi Jones, and other ambitious writers with new talents like Al Pacino and Jill Clayburgh. In 1966, Bentley played Lulu in Act IV's production of \\"The Deer Park\\", a play based on Mailer's novel of the same name. After appearing in the 1960 film Scent of Mystery, she had her first lead role on Broadway in The Heroine. Additional productions included Romanoff and Juliet, The Lovers, and numerous off-Broadway shows. Her film credits include A Face in the Crowd (1957); husband Norman Mailer's trilogy Wild 90 (1968), 'Beyond the Law' (1968), and Maidstone (1970); the cult horror film, C.H.U.D. (1984); and The Golden Boys (2008). Her son Michael Mailer explains that she refused to sign a contract in Hollywood, as she never wanted to be pinned down. Bentley's first love was theater. \\"She acted for half a century on stage, screen and film\\", said Mailer's official biographer J. Michael Lennon: \\"She was well-known in New York City. She was well-known on Cape Cod\\". Personal life Bentley was married to Norman Mailer, whom she met shortly after her Broadway debut in 1963. They married later that year, had a tumultuous marriage, became estranged in 1969 and divorced in 1980. They had two sons, Stephen and Michael. Although she worked professionally with Mailer on several movies, he tended to be \\"ruthlessly critical\\" of her acting. Her most prominent moment in a Mailer film may have been her part in the climactic fight scene of Maidstone. According to her son Michael, her life's two joys were her family and the theater. Since 1966, Bentley lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts. She died at age 88 on September 13, 2018.

Opened in 1933 as a joint project between the university and the Austin Independent School District, the school served both as a public junior high school and as a laboratory school for the university's Department of Education until 1967, when the school was closed and the facility turned over to UT. Today, the building houses the university's School of Social Work and its Child Care Center. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History In 1923 petroleum deposits were discovered on lands owned by the University of Texas System. New revenues from mineral royalties helped to fund a flurry of construction and renovation on the University of Texas at Austin's campus between 1925 and 1933. By the end of this period Texas was well into the Great Depression, and the Austin Public Schools program (now the Austin Independent School District) was struggling to provide adequate public education for the city's rapidly growing population with declining tax revenues. The school district's growing need for an additional public secondary school coincided with the university's Department of Education's growing interest in establishing a laboratory school where future teachers could be trained and new educational techniques tested. In 1932 the city and the university reached an agreement to establish a model secondary school, to be built and furnished by the university but operated by the school district, with the district paying the faculty. The school was initially envisioned as a six-year secondary school that would house grades seven through twelve, to be named \\"University High School\\"; in the end, however, the city's changing school-age demographics led the district to operate the campus as a three-year middle school serving grades six through eight, and the name was changed to \\"University Junior High School.\\" Construction on the school began in January 1933 and was completed that September at a total cost of $375,000 (). The first students entered the school on September 26, 1933. =Secondary school= The school was operated by AISD for thirty-four school years, from 1933 through 1967. From 1956 to 1957 the facility also served as a temporary home to Allan Junior High School, whose campus had been badly damaged by a fire in March 1956; both schools operated in the same building, with UJH holding shortened classes in the mornings and Allan meeting in the afternoons. University Junior High was the first public middle school in Austin to become racially integrated, accepting non-white students beginning with the 1957‚Äì58 school year. =University building= After the 1966‚Äì67 academic year AISD closed the school, and the university devoted the building first to its School of Music and later to elements of the College of Education and the Division for Continuing Education. In 1991 the university's Child Care Center for university and state employees opened in the former UJH facility, and the School of Social Work moved into the building in 1994; today these two programs continue to occupy the facility, which is now referred to as the School of Social Work Building. The former school site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 2001, in recognition of its significance in the development of the university's campus architecture and the history of pedagogical research and teacher education in Texas. Architecture The University Junior High School building is a roughly U-shaped reinforced concrete building with a veneer of buff Elgin brick and a hipped tile roof, with two main stories and a partially exposed basement. The school was primarily designed by architect George Dahl (with input from the university's consulting architect, Paul Philippe Cret) in an eclectic Spanish Revival style inspired by existing campus structures. It is located near the southeast corner of the University of Texas campus, south of Texas Memorial Stadium and north of the Texas Swimming Center, which was built over the school's former sports fields. The main entrance faces west toward Waller Creek and is set into a four-story central massing, flanked to the north by an auditorium (now called the Utopia Theater) and to the south by a former gymnasium (now used for office space). Concrete steps lead up to the main doors on the second level, above which recently added brass lettering labels the build as the \\"SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK.\\" Above the doors are three symmetrical windows separated by decorative terra cotta panels. At the fourth level three vertical stucco panels bear floral patterns flanking the seal of the university in relief and the incised words \\"UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL.\\" Above, a corbelled cornice separates the brick siding from the red tile roof.

The documentary blends everyday experience and political theory to address questions viewed as central to democracy. Interview subjects include academics, activists, politicians, refugees, trauma surgeons, students, and a barber. While attempting to address the primary question, the documentary also looks at pressing issues of contemporary times, including the Greek debt crisis. In the documentary, Taylor suggests that the current form of democracy is bad and people should seek a more direct democracy. Reviewers noted that the documentary never directly answers the title question.  Summary  The Allegory of Good and Bad Government is used as a structuring device in the film. At the beginning of the documentary, Astra Taylor discusses the meaning of The Allegory of Good and Bad Government with Silvia Federici in front of the fresco. In this discussion, Federici highlights that early European democracies recognized that a democracy came with its winners and its losers. The discussion of the fresco is used throughout the film as a structuring device, alongside discussions in important sites of ancient Athens with Efimia Karakantza and quotations from Plato's Republic. Cornel West builds on the winners and losers that Federici discussed to observe the large number of people left out of modern democracies. He also discusses when important change has come about as an undermining of majority-rule. The documentary then turns to a local healthcare group, operating illegally, as an example of people organizing at a local level to solve problems that no one else is. Later, Wendy Brown discusses the divide in philosophy between philosophers who prioritize individual bodily security, such as Thomas Hobbes, and philosophers who believed in the possibility of collective action, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Brown also presents the question of how to \\"make a democratic people out of an undemocratic one\\" and describes it as \\"our problem today.\\" The film, however, presents a perspective of the people interviewed as people who are civically-minded, even when democratic institutions do not work for them. Distribution The film premiered in June 2018 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest,Allan Hunter, \\"'What Is Democracy?': Sheffield Review\\".

Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times reviewed the film, saying, \\"Yet the movie has a tendency to take arguments to overbroad ends (should grade school be a democracy?) and is inevitably unwieldy. It's easy to imagine a more cogent film that weighted either philosophy or reportage more heavily.\\" Charlie Phillips awarded four stars to the film, when reviewing it for The Guardian, writing \\"An extended and good-looking essay, it serves as a sharp reminder to pay attention to politics and to remember that the personal and the local are political.\\" The film received a Vancouver Film Critics Circle award nomination for Best Canadian Documentary at the Vancouver Film Critics Circle Awards 2018.Josh Cabrita, \\"2019 Nominees Announced\\".

Joan was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, the only daughter of John Glassel who had emigrated from Longniddry; some accounts say she was born in Longniddry after his return.

Glassel owned extensive property in Virginia, which he signed over to his brother at the beginning of the American Revolution, returning with his wife and daughter to Scotland. Joan married the future duke in 1820, when he was known as Lord John Campbell. He had previously been divorced from his first wife Elizabeth, whom he had married against the wishes of his father in 1802. Lord and Lady Campbell had three children: * John Henry Campbell, Earl of Campbell (1821-1837) * George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll (1823-1900), who was married three times and had children * Lady Emma Augusta Campbell (1825-1893), who married Rt.

After Joan's death in 1828, Argyll married a third time, to Anne Monteith, a widow and the eldest daughter of John Cuninghame; she had been a friend of his second wife. He inherited his father's dukedom in 1839, thus his second wife was never Duchess of Argyll. The duke died, aged 69, in Inveraray Castle in Argyllshire and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

Born in Ayrshire, he was ordained into the United Secession Church in 1829, but later led independent and Burgher churches. He joined the established Church of Scotland in 1839, and in 1845 took over an expatriate congregation in Liverpool, England. Reid immigrated to Australia in 1852, living in Melbourne until 1858 and then in Sydney. He left the Church of Scotland and for a while ministered in John Dunmore Lang's schismatic sect, eventually ending his career at a non- denominational Bethel Union congregation. His son George Reid became the fourth Prime Minister of Australia. Early life Reid was born in Tarbolton, Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of Jean (n√©e Ronald) and John Reid. His father owned a farm called The Burn near Crosshouse. Reid likely began his education at the parish school in Tarbolton. His parents were probably non-conformists, as the local kirk was part of the New Licht faction of the Anti-Burghers. At the age of 15, Reid began studying at the University of Edinburgh. He attended classes in arts and medicine between 1815 and 1818, but as was common at the time did not graduate. In 1823, he entered the United Secession Theological Hall, an institution of the United Secession Church. He stayed there for three years, and was taught by John Dick.Prentis (1993), p. 339. Career in Scotland Reid received a probationary licence to preach in April 1826, from the presbytery of Cupar, Fife. He was formally ordained by the United Secession Church in early 1829, and received offers from congregations in Glasgow (Nicholson Street) and Edinburgh (Cowgate). He rejected both offers, instead accepting a call from the small rural parish of Dalry in Dumfriesshire. In March 1833, Reid dramatically resigned his post, reading a brief statement instead of a sermon and then walking out of the church, \\"to the astonishment and grief of the whole congregation\\".Prentis (1993), p. 340. He was suspended by the United Secession Church in May, and in July left the denomination altogether. The cause of his resignation was what he perceived as interference in his personal life.Prentis (1993), p. 341. After leaving Dalry, Reid moved to Edinburgh and took over the pulpit of an independent congregation, St Mary Magdalene's Chapel, which had been founded by his future brother-in-law Thomas Crybbace. In 1835, he switched to the United Christian Church, a small independent congregation in the Grassmarket district. The church lacked a building of its own, instead worshipping on the second floor of a factory. Reid was effectively an \\"urban missionary\\", working mostly with the poor. His stipend was only ¬£50, a quarter of what he had been offered by the United Secession Church in 1829. In 1837, the church voted to join the Auld Licht Burghers, and they were formally received into the Original Burgher Synod the following year.Prentis (1993), p. 342. In 1839, Reid took over an Auld Licht congregation in Bathgate, Linlithgowshire. Shortly after his arrival, the sect voted to rejoin the established Church of Scotland, and the Bathgate congregation followed despite local opposition. In April 1841, Reid moved to Johnstone, Renfrewshire, where he stayed for four years; three of his children were born there. He remained loyal to the established church in the Disruption of 1843, despite his theology being closer to that of the breakaway Free Church of Scotland.Prentis (1993), p. 343. Career in England In April 1845, Reid moved to Liverpool, England, to take over the Scots Church on Oldham Street, a \\"prosperous expatriate congregation with its fair share of ship-owners and merchants\\". It would be his longest single ministry, and his two youngest children were born there. In 1851, however, he decided to immigrate to Australia. According to his son George, this was because he had been diagnosed with bronchitis and was seeking a warmer climate. His congregation petitioned him to remain in Liverpool, and gifted him ¬£100 for his services. After briefly returning to Scotland, Reid and his family left for Australia via Liverpool in December 1851. He ministered on board the ship Martin Luther, and 156 passengers signed a petition thanking him for his chaplaincy.Prentis (1993), p. 344. Career in Australia Reid arrived in Melbourne on 10 March 1852, and on 7 July took over the Second Scots Church, which met in a hall on Queen Street. He translated to St John's, Essendon, in April 1853, and then to a congregation in North Melbourne in March 1856, where he remained until February 1858. In August 1857, the congregation petitioned for admittance to the United Presbyterian Church of Victoria, which had broken away from the Church of Scotland over what they felt was the unfair distribution of state aid.Prentis (1993), p. 345. In early 1858, Reid moved to Sydney to become a minister in the schismatic Synod of New South Wales.Prentis (1993), p. 346. A few years earlier he had come into contact with the synod's founder, John Dunmore Lang, who told him that he was seeking another Scottish- trained minister. Reid was soon elected moderator of the synod. He and Lang shared the preaching duties, while Lang dealt with marriages and public duties and Reid dealt with visitation. His wife established a ragged school in The Rocks.Prentis (1993), p. 347. Reid and Lang eventually fell out, although it has been noted that Reid lasted longer than many of Lang's previous colleagues. In May 1862, he accepted a position with Sydney's Bethel Union. He filled the positions of \\"seamen's chaplain\\" and minister of the nondenominational Mariners' Church in George Street. He was widely considered to have had a successful tenure, expanding the congregation, establishing a temperance society, and holding lecture series. Reid was readmitted into the Synod of Australia ‚Äì the largest Presbyterian sect ‚Äì in November 1863, as a minister-without-charge. He aspired to return to a rural parish, unsuccessfully applying for positions in Shoalhaven and Ipswich, Queensland. He died of cystitis on 18 July 1867 and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.Prentis (1993), p. 348. Personal life On 10 July 1834, Reid married Marion Crybbace, the daughter of another Presbyterian minister Edward Crybbace. He had attended theological school with her brother Thomas. The couple had seven children together ‚Äì John (b. 1836 in Edinburgh), William Ferguson (b. 1839 in Bathgate), Hugh Ronald (b. 1841 in Johnstone), Mark Watt (b. 1843 in Johnstone), George Houstoun (b. 1845 in Johnstone), and daughters Mary Eliza and Marion Jane (b. in Liverpool, dates uncertain). John, Hugh, and Mark went into the shipping industry, while William followed his father into the clergy.McMinn (1989), p. 5. Marion married businessman James Ewan, the chairman of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company. George entered politics, eventually becoming the fourth Prime Minister of Australia. In his memoirs he said of his father: \\"when praise comes my way for anything that seems to be good in what I have done, I feel painfully sensible of my almost total failure to do justice to the good example which he set\\".

He showed considerable promise as a juvenile in 2017 when he won two of his five races including the Zetland Stakes. In the following year he developed into a top class stayer, taking the Queen's Vase, Grand Prix de Paris and St Leger. As a four-year-old he added another major win as he took the British Champions Long Distance Cup as well as finishing second in the Coronation Cup and the Irish St. Leger. Background Kew Gardens is a bay horse with a white star bred in Ireland by the County Wicklow-based Barronstown Stud. The colt is owned by John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership have changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as the property of Susan Magnier, while on other occasions he has been described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo went on to become an outstanding sire of winners and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland nine times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Kew Gardens' dam Chelsea Rose as a high-class racemare who won five races including the Moyglare Stud Stakes. She is descended from Senones, a full-sister to the Prix du Jockey Club winner Sicambre. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Kew Gardens began his racing career by finishing seventh in a maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 7 August 2017. Sixteen days later, the colt started 4/6 favourite against seven opponents in a similar event over one mile at Killarney Racecourse. Ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien, he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won \\"easily\\" by four and a half lengths. On 9 September Kew Gardens was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Juvenile Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he was ridden by Seamie Heffernan, and finished second of the ten runners, beaten three lengths by his stablemate Nelson. Two weeks later he contested the Group 2 Beresford Stakes at the Naas Racecourse in which he led for most of the way before fading in the closing stages and coming home fourth of the five runners behind Saxon Warrior. For his final run of the season the colt was sent to England for the Listed Zetland Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 14 October, and started the 13/8 favourite. Ridden by Ryan Moore he took the lead soon after the start, drew away from his rivals in the closing stages and won by three and a half lengths from Dee Ex Bee. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Ryan was very happy and said he was very uncomplicated. He's a very good-natured, genuine, good-moving horse. Ryan said he galloped out very well\\". =2018: three-year- old season= On his three-year-old debut, Kew Gardens returned to Newmarket for the Feilden Stakes on 17 April for which he started favourite but finished third behind Mildenberger and Fortune's Pearl. On 12 May he was made odds-on favourite for Betfred Derby Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park but was beaten three and a quarter lengths into second place by Knight To Behold after failing to recover from a poor start. In the 2018 Epsom Derby Kew Gardens started a 16/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field. He was among the leaders throughout the race and went to the front in the straight but was outpaced in the final furlong and dropped back to finish in ninth place. At Royal Ascot on 20 June the colt was stepped up in distance for the Group 3 Queen's Vase over fourteen furlongs. With Donnacha O'Brien in the saddle he was restrained towards the rear of the twelve-runner field before making steady progress from half way. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win \\"readily\\" by four and a half lengths and a neck from his stablemates Southern France and Nelson. After the race O'Brien said \\"I'm delighted with him. I thought he'd stay and he was good. He was a little bit disappointing at Epsom, and Donnacha thought we maybe rode him a bit too forward\\". Kew Gardens was then sent to France for the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 July and started the 7/5 favourite against five opponents including Neufbosc (Prix du Lys), Dee Ex Bee and Nelson. Ridden by Moore he was settled towards the rear of the field before taking the lead 300 metres out and kept on well in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths from Neufbosc. O'Brien said \\"The idea with bringing him back to a mile and a half is that we could have a look at whether the King George would be suitable. That's probably where he'll go next\\". The colt bypassed the King George for the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse in August in which he carried a five-pound weight penalty for his Group 1 success and was beaten into third place behind Old Persian and Cross Counter. The 242nd running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 15 September attracted a field of twelve runners with Kew Gardens going of the 3/1 second choice in the betting behind the previously unbeaten filly Lah Ti Dar. The other runners included Loxley (Grand Prix de Deauville), Old Persian, Dee Ex Bee, Nelson, Southern France, Maid Up (March Stakes) and The Pentagon (Tyros Stakes). Moore tracked the leaders before making a sustained run on the outside in the straight. Kew Gardens went to the front two furlongs out and stayed on strongly to win by two and a quarter lengths from Lah Ti Dar with a gap of four and a half lengths back to Southern France in third. After the race Moore said \\"It was very smooth. He's a very uncomplicated horse and he tries very hard. He's got a great attitude to life and he picked up really well. He's a super horse\\". In the 2018 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 7 October the colt started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting in a nineteen-runner field. After being restrained by Moore towards the rear he made steady progress in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished seventh, four lengths behind the winner Enable. =2019: four-year-old season= Kew Gardens began his third campaign in the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse on 9 May. He was made the 4/5 favourite despite carrying top weight of 133 pounds but was never able to get on terms with the enterprisingly ridden Morando and was beaten eight lengths into second place. On his next race the colt contested the Coronation Cup at Epsom three weeks later in which he led inside the final furlong before being overtaken and beaten half a length by Defoe. The colt was then aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup but sustained a back injury in training which kept him off the track until autumn. After a lengthy break Kew Gardens returned in autumn for the Irish St. Leger over fourteen furlongs at the Curragh on 15 September. After racing towards the rear of the field he stayed on strongly in the straight but registered his third successive second place as he was beaten just over two lengths by the three-year-old filly Search For A Song. In the British Champions Long Distance Cup over two miles at Ascot on 19 October Kew Gardens was partnered by Donnacha O'Brien and started the 7/2 second favourite behind Stradivarius in a nine-runner field which also included Withhold (Rose Bowl Stakes), Royal Line (September Stakes), Capri and Cleonte (Queen Alexandra Stakes). After racing in third place behind Withhold and Capri, Kew Gardens took the lead in the straight and although he was headed by Stradivarius he rallied to regain the advantage in the final strides and won by a nose. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"we were training him for the Gold Cup and he got an injury and it all went pear shaped so we're just so lucky to get him back. He pulled all the muscles in his back just before Ascot. He barely made it back for the Irish St. Leger and that race just didn't go right. He's an incredible horse... He's a very brave horse, so I'm delighted. I'd say the Gold Cup next year would definitely be the target if he stayed in training next year\\". Stud career It was announced in June 2020 that Kew Gardens would be retired from racing and stand at Castlehyde Stud for Coolmore as a National Hunt stallion.

The lower jaw has a short sideways-projecting spine on either side near the tip. The dorsal fin has 15 to 21 soft rays and the anal fin has 14 to 17. The small pelvic fins are at the midpoint of the body, the origin of the dorsal fin is slightly behind this and the origin of the anal fin is below the centre of the dorsal fin. This fish is a uniformly dark colour except for a row of light-coloured, opalescent scales along the belly. It grows to a maximum length of SL, but is a more normal size. Distribution and habitat Barbantus curvifrons has a wide distribution. Its range includes subtropical and tropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and temperate, subtropical and tropical waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the Bay of Biscay southwards to Angola; it is absent from the western Atlantic.

He has been described as \\"...one of a trio of pioneers (Jane Goodall and Adriaan Kortlandt being the others) who founded field studies of chimpanzees in the 1960s.\\"  Education  Reynolds was educated at Collyer's School, Horsham and University College, London. He taught anthropology at the University of Bristol from 1966 to 1972, when he was appointed University Lecturer in Biological Anthropology at the University of Oxford. He continued to teach at Oxford later becoming Professor and a Fellow of Magdalen College until his retirement in 2001. Today, he holds the title as Emeritus Professor.  Research  = Budongo Conversation Field Station = In 1990, Reynolds founded the Budongo Conservation Field Station (BCFS) in the Budongo Forest in Uganda. The purpose of the station is to conduct scientific research on primates, lead conservation efforts, and serve as a model for sustainable rainforest management. Originally, the station was called the Budongo Forest Project when Reynolds studied and protected about 800 chimpanzees in the forest. In 1988, as Uganda faced a civil war, Reynolds read a news report from a major Ugandan newspaper concerning chimpanzee infants being smuggled as pets for wealthy individuals in Dubai. Motivated by the report, he spent the next year seeking funds to establish a base committed to research the chimpanzee population changes in the Budongo forest. After securing initial funding from the Jane Goodall Institute, Reynolds' crew was able to construct trails in the forest to gain better access with the chimpanzees. Today, Reynolds remains involved with the BCFS serving in a supporting role as a member of the board of directors and as senior advisor. = Study on Chimpanzee Culture = In 1999, Reynolds, Jane Goodall, and his research team published an extensive study on the cultural variation of chimpanzees. Their study expanded on some of the previously known chimpanzees' behavioral patterns. The study revealed 39 behavioral patterns that differed in various communities. Reynolds and his team observed that certain behaviors such as grooming, courtship, and tool use, were present in various chimpanzee communities but absent in others. The study described their cultural findings as drawing resemblance to human cultures, a feature that was once unapparent in other species.  Books  The focus of Reynolds's 2005 book, The Chimpanzees of the Budongo Forest: Ecology Behaviour and Conservation, is on his 15 years account on the Sonso chimpanzee community. The Sonso community is a group of fifty chimpanzees that resides in the Budongo Forest. The book described the community's social organization, diet, culture, behavioral adaptations while living in the complex environment of the Budongo Forest. Reynolds described the mating rituals, with the Sonso females arranging male to male competition rather than actively seeking males with the most desirable characteristics. Toward the end of the book, Reynolds discussed some of the threats that the Sonso community faced and issues with conservation efforts, including revenge huntings from hostilities with the local people and accidental killings from snares. To improve the Sonsos' chance of survival, Reynolds called for the establishment of a buffer zone between the forests and the fields. He also advocated educating the locals on chimpanzee conservation efforts.  Awards  In 2020, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Primatological Society (IPS). He was honored for his research, conservation contributions, and advancement of education toward non- human primates.

On August 12, 1812, a battle took place between the part of the 3rd Reserve Observation Army (about 18,000 men) under the command of General Tormasov and the Austrian and Saxon corps of the Austrian prince Schwarzenberg and Reynier (about 40,000 men). The Russian position from the front was accessible only by three dams, which passed through the marshy tributary of the Mukhavets River; its right flank rested against the swamp; the left was covered by a forest (considered impassable), through which the road to Kobryn passed. Prince Schwarzenberg sent a detachment bypassing the left flank, the unexpected appearance of which caused Tormasov to draw almost all the troops there. All enemy attacks on the Russian left flank were repulsed, and nothing decisive was attempted against the Russian front. Thanks to this Tormasov, despite the great superiority of forces from the enemy side, stayed on the position until the evening. At night, fearing for his retreat, he went to Kobryn.

Design Front view of the Hitachi Caravaggio The Caravaggio is a high-capacity double-deck EMU for regional traffic, each car is about long. The Caravaggio is of equivalent quality to contemporary high speed trains for passengers and crews. Compared to the trains it is replacing, it provides greater comfort and sustainability and is more accessible for people with reduced mobility. It consumes 30% less energy than the historic fleet, and is more than 95% recyclable. Additional environmentally-friendly measures include regenerative braking and lower noise emissions. In 2018, Maurizio Manfellotto, CEO of Hitachi Rail Italy, claimed the Caravaggio's carbon emissions of 5 grams CO2eq were the lowest for any mass transport mode in Italy. Each train is powered by a 3 kV DC electric system producing and a maximum speed of . The traction equipment is mostly roof-mounted, optimising the interior space for passenger accommodation. The train's acceleration is greater than 1m/sec¬≤, which has been credited with improving punctuality. The train is equipped with side- and front-facing cameras with anomalous behaviour detection. The body is primarily made of lightweight alloys, giving a low weight per passenger and a high passenger capacity per unit length. Passenger capacity varies by operator; in Trentialia's configuration, a five-car set can carry up to 656 people, while an equivalent FNM set can carry 598 seated passengers and 575 standing. The trainset's ergonomic eco-friendly leather seats are designed for comfort. The cabin has air conditioning which is adjusted according to the number of passengers on board, to lower energy consumption. Each 5-car train has ten doors per side and two toilets (one standard and one for people with reduced mobility). The Caravaggio has luggage storage areas and dedicated spaces for bicycles, sockets to charge electric bicycles. The trains have LED lighting, Wi-Fi, USB sockets, a passenger information system, energy meters, and a passenger counter. Staircases above the bogies give access to the upper deck. The doors are fitted with movable steps to cover the gap between the platform and vehicle when the train is stopped; a manually-operated ramp is available for passengers with reduced mobility.

Early years (1625‚Äì60) Charles de Sales was born in 1625 in the Ch√¢teau de Sales in what is today Thorens- Gli√®res, Haute-Savoie, France. His father was Louis, comte de Sales (1577‚Äì1654), brother of Saint Francis de Sales, a noble of the Duchy of Savoy. Charles de Sales became a chevalier of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem (Knights Hospitaller) in 1643, and fought in several campaigns against the Turks. He contributed to the defense of Crete in 1650. In 1651 the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique went bankrupt and Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy persuaded Jean-Paul Lascaris-Castellar, grand master of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, to buy the French part of Saint-Christopher Island and the smaller islands of Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Martin and Saint Croix for 120,000 √©cus. King Louis XIV of France remained sovereign of the islands, and Poincy was confirmed as governor of Saint Christophe. Charles de Sales was sent by the Order to govern with Poincy in 1657 on the death of the Chevalier Charles de Montmagny. In 1659 the French and English in the Antilles concluded an offensive and defensive league against the Island Caribs in the Leeward Islands. In the event of hostilities being declared between the two countries the union was to continue for six months. The agreement was signed by Governor Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√© of Guadeloupe and Charles de Sales for the French, and by governors Roger Osborne of Montserrat and James Russell of Nevis for the English. Governor of Saint Christophe (1660‚Äì66) 300px After Poincy died in 1660 the Order, which had still not paid all the purchase money, appointed Charles de Sales the new governor. He took office as lieutenant general and governor of Saint Christophe on 11 April 1660. Jean-Baptiste Colbert put pressure on the Hospitallers to return the islands to the crown. They ceded the islands to France in 1665, passing ownership to the new French West India Company. In February 1665 de Sales was confirmed as governor of Saint Christophe by the company. The Second Anglo-Dutch War formally began in March 1665. In January 1666, with a growing threat of war between France and England, de Sales made a treaty with Governor William Watts of the English part of the island under which they agreed that when one party heard that war had been declared they would notify the other, and they would delay for three days before launching an attack. To confirm the agreement, de Sales sent a mission to the English governor general Francis Willoughby in Barbados, but he was evasive. France declared war on England in January 1666. War and death (1666) Hostilities between the French and English on Saint Christopher broke out before the official declaration of war was received. Fighting began on 21 April 1666 (Gregorian calendar), and the French routed the numerically superior English forces two days later. De Sales was killed during the fighting, as was the English governor Watts. De Sales died on 22 April 1666. Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent became governor of the whole island.

History Mulberry Street, on the Lower East Side of New York City in 1900, not long before the TU formed =1910s= New York City's Singer Building was the world's tallest building in 1908, , shortly before the TU formed In 1916, the New York City Teachers Union formed. That same year, it received a charter to join the American Federation of Teachers as \\"AFT Local 5\\" (often cited simply as \\"Local 5\\"). Its principal co-founders were Henry Linville (a Harvard-educated, Socialist, pacifist biology teacher) and Abraham Lefkowitz (a New York University-educated academic). From 1916 to 1935, Linville served as president and Lefkowitz as vice president and legislative expert. Their top agenda for the TU were: 1) recognition for teachers as professionals, 2) better salaries for teachers, 3) respect for teachers by administrators, and 4) academic freedom (including protection from loyalty oaths). Nevertheless, even New York In 1919, AFT and TU leaders resisted the Red Scare that targeted teachers and union organizers. =1920s= Communist Party (Majority Group) was a contender for control of the TU during the 1920s In the 1920s, the TU sought to gain increases in teacher salaries and pensions, smaller sizes for classroom, tenure for teachers, and more aid from the State of New York. In the mid-1920s, political factions appeared within the TU, of which the most prominent were communist factions. During the 1920s, under the legal name Workers Party of America, the CPUSA became active in education. (The Communist split several times during the 1920s, e.g., Communist Party (Majority Group), until it received full alignment with the Comintern in 1929.) First, it addressed adult education (largely for non-native speaker) with workers schools, focused on New York City with the New York Workers School. Concurrently, the CPUSA began a campaign to gain control of the Teachers Union. In 1923, a \\"Research Study Group\\" formed, affiliated with the outside Educational Workers International, itself formed by the Red International of Labor Groups, in turn affiliated with the Communist International (\\"Comintern\\"). Heading the Research Study Group was TU secretary (and CPUSA member) Benjamin Mandel (later director of research for the House Un-American Activities Committee or HUAC); members (not yet split into two rival communist parties) included: Ben Davidson, Bertram Wolfe, Jacob Lind, Rachel Ragozin, Jack Hardy (party name of Dale Zysman), Sarah Golden, Clara Reibert, Abraham Zitron, and Isidore Begun. By 1925, they had emerged as a vociferous faction with the TU (as Linville attested to the AFT in 1935). When Joseph Stalin ousted Jay Lovestone as head of the CPUSA, Lovestone's followers in the TU formed a \\"Progressive Group\\" against a \\"Rank and File Group\\" that remained loyal to the CPUSA. Progressive Group members included Mandel, Davidson, and Wolfe. =1930s= 1929 crash (here, crowd gathers at Wall Street and Broad Street) With the Great Depression, however, CPUSA membership grew, reflected in TU membership by 1932. Another split occurred when leadership strove to keep TU membership limited to full-time public school teachers, while other members began advocating to open membership to substitute teachers, private school teachers, and (after 1929) teachers in the New Deal Work Projects Administration. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, the CPUSA began to make headway in its control as its members struggled internally with less leftist, more liberal fellow members of the Teachers Union. On October 27, 1932, the TU administration choose a Committee of Five to deliberate on five members of the \\"Rank and File\\" group (Joseph Leboit, Clara Reiber, Alice Citron, Abraham Zitron, and Isidore Begun) and one member of the \\"Progressive\\" group (Bertram Wolfe). In a counter-attack, the two communist factions made their own minority report (written by Begun, Davidson, Florence Gitlin, and David M. Wittes) on the TU's administration. On April 29, 1933, John Dewey delivered the Committee of Five's report, which called for investigation into the two groups and whether a new local might form free from communist influence. By 1935, the Committee had determined that the TU was helpless to rid itself of communist factions; it could not muster the votes needed. By 1935, thanks in part to the \\"United Front\\" policy of the Comintern, the CPUSA gained control of the Teachers Union, which it held through 1938. The CPUSA then tried to gain control of its parent, the American Federation of Teachers (whose president at that time was Jerome Davis, later involved in a sensational libel suit). At the same time, the CPUSA tried to mobilize Teachers Union members into joined various United Front-style group, including: # \\"Intellectual\\" fronts, e.g., the Jefferson School of Social Science # \\"Friends\\" groups, e.g., Friends of the Soviet Union, National Council of American‚ÄìSoviet Friendship # \\"Anti-fascist\\" groups, e.g., American League Against War and Fascism, American Medical Bureau, Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee # Special-interest groups for African-Americans, foreign- born Americans, sharecroppers, scientists # \\"Defense\\" organizations, e.g., International Labor Defense During an August 1935 national convention of the AFT, the TU administration asked for a referendum to reorganize, voted down 100 to 79. As a result, TU co-founders Linville and Lefkowitz led some 800 of some 2,000 members out of the TU to form the New York City Teachers Guild. In 1936, leadership of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), parent of the American Federation of Teachers (AFL) (parent to the TU), recommended that the AFL revoke the TU's charter as Local 5, AFT. The AFT (whose president was then Jerome Davis) disregarded the AFL's recommendation. In 1937, Abe Meeropol published the poem \\"Strange Fruit\\" under the title \\"Bitter Fruit\\" in 1937 in The New York Teacher, a union magazine of the Teachers Union. On March 15, 1938, the Greater New York Centra Trades and Labor Council suspended to the TU's membership, while the Joint Committee of Teachers Organizations (JCTO) of New York City expelled the TU. =1940s= In August 1941, the AFT revoked the TU's charter as Local 5, AFT. The TU then became Local 555 of the United Public Workers (UPW), affiliate of the AFL's national rival, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). After World War II, the Teachers Union found itself attacked by \\"Hearst press, the American Legion, and the rural-dominated state legislatures.\\" =1950s= In February 1950, the CIO expelled the UPW (thus also the TU) from membership. In 1952, the TU withdrew from the UPW. =1960s= In June 1964, the TU agreed to dissolve during an annual convention. Assessments In his 1959 book The Communists & the Schools, Robert W. Iversen noted that the Great Depression had caused impoverished families to send their children to \\"free municipal colleges\\" (e.g., City College of New York), where the Young Communist League of America worked to recruit them or steer them toward YCL-CPUSA-controlled fronts (e.g., the American Student Union). Nevertheless, Iversen concluded that communists within academia \\"tended to be concentrated in a few areas, leaving the schools as a whole relatively unaffected.\\" Further, their active period was largely only the 1930s and \\"varied widely in the degree of their commitment and involvement in the movement.\\" During the 1940s, graduates tended to move to the suburbs and reject communism. As for the vehemence of the 1940s and 1950s attacks on the Teachers Union, Iversen ascribes such to \\"a bewildering web of persistent patriots who have made careers of dossier-building\\" at home in reaction to the spread of Communist nations abroad (e.g., Soviet atomic capability and the victory of the Chinese Communist Party, both in 1949). Ultimately, Iversen concluded that American students were not communist \\"products\\" of indoctrination in the American school system. In 1985, the University of the State of New York noted: > Teachers' unions, including the New York City Teachers Union, founded in > 1916, and its successor in the American Federation of Teachers, worked not > only to improve wages and benefits, but also to promote measures they > believed would benefit schools and pupils. It was not until the 1960s, > however, that teacher unions generally attained the status of collective > bargaining agents. In his 2013 book Reds at the Blackboard, Clarence Taylor distinguishes between \\"anti-Communist\\" and \\"revisionist\\" histories of the TU. He questions: > The evidence is clear that members of the TU, especially those in the > Communist Party, supported Communist Party policies. But does the evidence > show that the TU was a tool of the Communist Party, unconcerned with the > interest of teachers, or did the union act independently of the Communist > Party? Taylor's response is that both viewpoints are \\"too simplistic.\\" Instead, he argues, there is a need to appreciate the TU's advocacy for \\"social movement unionism,\\" which manifested itself in the TU's alliances with unions, parents, civil rights organizations, and political parties. The TU's primary objectives were to overcome barriers to education, which include racial discrimination and poverty ‚Äì in addition to higher salaries and better working conditions for teachers. Ultimately, he concludes, the TU created a \\"unique type of unionism that was in the forefront for civil rights and academic freedom.\\" In 2018, Stephen Brier assessed: > The union that later became the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) would > literally grow out of the shell of the older Teachers' Guild (TG), a social- > democratic split off from the more radical New York Teachers‚Äô Union (TU), > which Communist Party activists had helped reorganize as a CIO union during > the Great Depression.

Background =Geography= Kommeno is a village in western Greece near Arta. It is located on the east bank of the Arachthos river, north of the Gulf of Ambracia. According to the 1940 census, it had 776 inhabitants engaged in agriculture and fishing. =1943 in Kommeno= By the summer of 1943, Greek partisan organizations such as ELAS and EDES had assembled strong armed bands which frequently attacked the Axis occupation forces. As the partisans relied upon civilians for food and intelligence, the Wehrmacht applied collective responsibility to entire communities and systematically used mass reprisals to intimidate the population. The massacre of Kommeno is a typical example of this policy. On 12 August 1943 a small food requisitioning detachment of partisans reached Kommeno. While collecting food, a two-man Wehrmacht reconnaissance team drove into the village and upon seeing the partisans, made a U-turn and drove away. Fearing reprisals, the locals spent the night in the fields and sent a delegation to the Italian commander in Arta to explain the situation. Being reassured that there wouldn't be any consequences, they returned to their homes and prepared to celebrate the Assumption on the 15th. On the evening of 15 August, a marriage had taken place in Kommeno and many people from the village and the surrounding area stayed up late celebrating. The massacre The 98th Regiment of the 1st Mt Division during the invasion of Poland, 1939 At dawn on 16 August, 120 men of the 12th Company of the 98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division under the command of Leutnant Willibald R√∂ser drove to Kommeno on lorries. On the previous night, the regiment commander Oberst had given them a short, fierce speech alleging that they were going to wipe out a partisan nest and ordering them to spare no one. Most of the men had been fighting in the Eastern Front and they were accustomed to carrying out similar reprisals against the local population. The soldiers surrounded the village from three directions, leaving unattended only the access to the Arachthos river. Houses were first attacked with grenades and as villagers awoke and tried to flee, they were indiscriminately shot at. Many women, children and elderly fell victims. Among the first casualties was the village priest, who was killed by R√∂ser as he begged him to spare his church fold. Several eyewitness reports described women being raped, people beaten and corpses humiliated. Around forty of the marriage guests that were still awake celebrating were also murdered. The only escape route lay across the river and many villagers managed to cross it, either swimming or onboard small boats. After seizing livestock and looting valuables, the Germans set the village ablaze. Aftermath Memorial to the massacre in Kommeno, with the names and ages of those killed The official list of casualties includes 317 victims, among which 73 children aged under ten, 20 entire families and the newlyweds. A monument commemorating the massacre has been erected in the main square. The official Wehrmacht reports about the events in Kommeno falsely claimed that the village was in partisan hands who opened heavy fire against the Germans. It also claimed that 150 \\"partisans\\" were killed as a result. Salminger was killed in an ambush by partisans on 1 October 1943. In reprisal, German forces of the 1st Mountain Division perpetrated the Lyngiades massacre on 3 October 1943. R√∂ser was killed in November 1944 in Freiburg during an airstrike. The divisional commander, Generalleutnant went missing after mid-October 1944 near Belgrade, and was never brought to justice for the atrocities in Kommeno. No reparations were paid to the families of the victims.

The church of St Michael and All Angels is located at the centre of the village and dates from the Norman period. The tower and porch date from the 15th century. The church was restored and partially rebuilt in the 1870s. A school was built in the village in 1860, though subsequently converted for residential use. The village population had jumped from 149 to 213 between 1861 and 1871, probably because of people moving there to work on the nearby railway. By 1901 the population of the parish was 257. The Black Cock Inn is located next to the church. Its name (though referring to a black cockerel) has been misinterpreted as offensive and, in the run-up to Christmas 2015, its Facebook page was blocked due to \\"racist or offensive language\\" It has been called The Black Cock since 1840.

Lopez is an instructor of Religious Studies and part of the core faculty in Women and Gender Studies, at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. Her practice is in the revisions of the New Testament, Christian origins and Early Christianity. As a researcher of the New Testament, she is the author of Apostle to the Conquered: Reimagining Paul's Mission and the co- author, with Todd Penner, of De-Introducing the New Testament: Texts, Worlds, Methods, Stories. She is presently the co-chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's \\"Rhetoric and the New Testament\\" section and serves on several editorial boards, including Biblical Interpretation: A Journal of Contemporary Approaches and The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Gender Studies. She has contributed to the Society of Biblical Literature's Bible Odyssey project and has also served on the American Academy of Religion's Board of Directors, Women's Caucus for Religious Studies, and Teaching and Learning Committee.  Achievements  At the age of 21, Lopez organized Emory's greatest yearly events for the scope of Women‚Äôs History Month. She coordinated meetings for the Women‚Äôs History Month committee and created the Women‚Äôs History Month calendar.  Undergraduate  Lopez was an activist for women's issues as an early undergraduate at Oxford college and while she was at Emory. She participated in the President‚Äôs Commission on the Status of Women and on its Student Concerns Committee. She was also one of the founders of SEED (Student Editors on Eating Disorders). The focus of this editing board was not really about healing women from eating disorders but to raise awareness on the school campus. They wanted to inform people of what sort of cultural and social factors cause some women to having eating disorders, how usual it is on college campuses and what people can do to prevent women from getting eating disorders. Lopez also worked in the Office of Homosexual Life as she saw connections between women and homosexuals struggling for equality. Shortly after graduating from Emory with a degree in religion she leaves to attend the Union Theological Seminary in New York to propose a master of arts in religion and education.  Graduate  Lopez completed her doctorate at the Union Theological Seminary in New York. Her field research includes Pauline Studies, Jewish and Roman imperial contexts of the New Testament writings and Early Christian literature. She also has interest in the research of ancient and modern rhetoric; visual representation and art performance, film as a critical model for interpreting biblical texts and traditions, as well as the study of gender and sexuality.  Teaching  Being a member of Letters Collegium, the courses that Lopez teaches in biblical and ancient studies emphasize the relationship between both the modern and ancient worlds, methodology in biblical interpretation, issues in understanding religious innovations, the continuing relevance of the Bible as a significant site for articulations of power relationships and community identity-construction across time and cultures. As a dedicated professor for humanities and the liberal arts, Lopez also teaches for the Film Studies, Ancient Studies and Women and Gender Studies programs at Eckerd College. The reflective learning, courses she teaches focus on poverty, intimate violence, mass incarceration and ex- offenders. = Previously taught courses = * Understanding Religion * Engaging the Bible * Horrified: Religion and Monsters * Seminar: Feminism and Gender Theory  Scholarly works and contributions to historical studies  As a scholar of the New Testament, Davina Lopez is also the author of Apostle to the Conquered: Reimagining Paul's Mission and co-author, with Todd Penner, of De-Introducing the New Testament: Texts, Worlds, Methods, Stories. She is currently preparing a detailed study on ancient and contemporary representations of Pauline bodies. The first book Lopez wrote took a significant turn in Pauline studies following a new perspective. This new perspective has corrected the Western theological traditions preoccupation with the spiritual condition of the individual's consciousness and a supposed anti-Jewish bias. Her feminist and queer approaches put forward gender and sexuality as useful options for seeing more adequately the hierarchical relations of power operative in the Roman Empire during Paul‚Äôs time. Her second book both re-evaluates and re-narrates the field of New Testament studies. Lopez and Penner attempt to explore the field, defamiliarize and interrogate it, and prod at its foundational assumptions. This results in an original contribution on what New Testament studies are, has been, and might yet be. Lopez provides a critical intervention into several methodological impasses in contemporary New Testament scholarship. = 'Apostle to the Conquered' = Apostle to the Conquered: Reimagining Paul's Mission is a book that Lopez criticizes the traditional scholarship. She describes how Paul's words and mission has been influenced by imperial Rome's symbols and ideology. Lopez rejects the idealist traditional approach which does not take into account the social-political context of the New Testament. In the opposition of the idealist approach, she argues that the biblical texts should be read as part of the complex social structure. In her quest, Lopez adopts \\"empire- critical, postcolonial, feminist, and queer\\" methodologies. In doing so, Lopez asks the question of What did Paul mean by identifying himself as \\"apostle to the nations\\"? To answer this question, Lopez studies the patriarchal and imperial ideology in Rome's context. Lopez, in her study, examines the different depictions of Rome and other nations within the Roman society. Rome was represented by god, emperor, and high man figure, whereas other nations were represented by a defeated, conquered, and low women figure. Thus, Lopez linked Paul's \\"apostle to the nations\\" to Rome's gender construction. She argued that while Paul's conversion, he realizes that he is in the same situation of the crucified Jesus as being subjected to the Roman death. Thus, Paul's perception of himself and people who followed him took the same way the Rome's image of other nations: defeated and suffering female figure. = 'De- Introducing the New Testament' = Lopez is a co-author with Todd C Penner of De-Introducing the New Testament: Texts, Worlds, Methods, Stories. The importance of this book is its argument for a postmodern framework in biblical studies. They call for a renewed method to de-familiarizing the power relation in the New Testament. The first chapter discusses how the New Testament depicts the order of things. It also criticizes the epistemological and main approach of New Testament studies. The second chapter turns to a related point of the approaches that are taken for granted in New Testament studies' textbooks. In the third chapter, the authors suggest an approach that studies the material culture in New Testament studies. They emphasize the importance of studying the text as a part of the whole context and thus, they mention the importance of adopting material objects in New Testament studies. The final chapter is titled ‚Äú Biblical .‚Äù This chapter discusses the context of the increment of methodological approaches during the time of neoliberalism. The argument of this chapter is that branding leads to neoliberal subjectivity in New Testament studies. In doing so, ‚Äúscholars construct and promote themselves as ‚Äòbrands,‚Äô ‚Äòsellers,‚Äô and ‚Äòconsumers‚Äô in relation to intellectual currents and content.‚Äù  Select bibliography  * Looking for an Argument: On Visual Rhetoric and Biblical Interpretation.

Biography =Early life= Whitehouse was born in London in 1857 and studied civil engineering at King's College London.Who's who in engineering, New York: John W. Leonard Corp., 1922. =Early career= His first commission was with the Durban- Maritzburg railway in Natal. Thereafter he was posted to Mexico where he surveyed and constructed the mountain section of the Inter-Oceanic Railway between Vera Cruz and Mexico City. After a short spell back in the United Kingdom working on the Dover to Chatham line, he was posted to British India. He was employed by the public works committee of the North Western Province, and in 1886 he received thanks from the Government of India for his work in the Bolan Pass. His next move was to Peru, where he assisted in the construction of a railway in the Andes. In 1892 he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. =Uganda Railway= In September 1895 he was appointed chief engineer of an ambitious plan to build a railway from the coast of Mombasa inland to Kampala, and embarked at Mombasa with his team in December 1895. Construction became infamous due to the difficulty of the terrain, and constant threat to the lives of workers from wildlife. Whilst planning the project, he selected the site of Nairobi as a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the labourers working on the railway.Anne-Marie Deisser, Mugwima Njuguna, Conservation of Natural and Cultural Heritage in Kenya, UCL Press, 7 Oct 2016, p.76 Nairobi was primarily chosen due to its favourable elevated position situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. The settlement at Nairobi would develop into the administrative headquarters of the East Africa Protectorate and capital city of Kenya. During his time in East Africa, Whitehouse was disillusioned with London, feeling that he was underpaid for his trials and responsibilities with the railway. He was also reprimanded twice by London, firstly for purchasing coal from India without permission and secondly for putting forth a proposal for extra leave for railway staff which was deemed too costly and generous. From 1901, despite being overworked and suffering from fever, he was put under pressure from London to complete the project. When the railway was opened for traffic in 1901, he became its manager in addition to the chief engineer. He resigned in 1903 and returned to England with his family. =Later life= On his return to London, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath but was warned by the consulting engineer for the project, Sir Alexander Rendel, that he would never get another job. In 1904, however, he was appointed chief engineer of the Central Argentine Railway and the Buenos Aires and Rosario Railway. He retired in 1910 and died at Westminster in London in 1938, survived by his wife and three sons.

Part of the Chiller series, \\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\\" is an urban ghost story that implements Web animation to deliver jump scares. The webcomic went viral shortly after its release. Background In July 2011, artist Horang published the short webtoon \\"Ok-su Station Ghost\\" on Naver Webtoon as part of his Chiller series. This webtoon included 3D-like effects, including in a scene in which a ghost's hand appears to jump out of the screen as if to grab the viewer. Horang followed this webcomic up with \\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\\" later that month. An English fan translation and video dub were created in August, as the webcomic quickly went viral internationally. An official English translation was published on September 17. Synopsis Set in Bongcheon-dong, Seoul, the webcomic shows a student walking home from school late at night meeting a female ghost who is apparently looking for her baby. The frightened student points in a random direction just to create distance between her and the ghost. However, as she starts to leave, the ghost rapidly chases her and quickly catches up with her, at which point she faints. When she is woken up by a neighbour the next day, she finds out that a woman in her district had committed suicide the previous night after losing custody of her child. Animation Horang implemented sudden animations in his webcomic, intended to deliver jump scares. The ghost's head suddenly rotates 180 degrees when the student first approaches her, and the rapid attack of the ghost is similarly animated. Horang composed sound effects to go alongside the work. \\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\\" comes with a warning, stating \\"Reader discretion is advised for pregnant women, the elderly, and those suffering from serious medical conditions.\\" Impact \\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\\" was popularized in part for English-speaking audiences by YouTuber PewDiePie. \\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\\" served as an inspiration for the 2017 horror visual novel The Letter, alongside various Japanese horror works. The webtoon similarly influenced Cameron Lucente in creating his webcomic RoomZero. Horang has continued creating horror webtoons: he has released a large number of short animated webcomics as part of his Chiller series since 2007. In 2013, Horang posted \\"Ghost in the Masung Tunnel\\", which similarly used 3D animation and programming to set a mood and deliver jump scares.

Early life Kendrew was born in Keith, Banffshire in northern Scotland in 1884. His father was a customs officer who soon moved the family to Dublin. Kendrew attended Mountjoy School before going to Oxford University where he studied classical literature. Career In 1911, he obtained a Certificate in Regional Geography and a Diploma in Geography and began to lecture in the School of Geography in 1912. His first publication was a chapter on climate written for the Oxford Survey of the British Empire edited by his professor at the time, A. J. Herbertson. He became a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1913. When World War I began he enlisted in the army and started officer training at a program in Oxford. In 1917 he joined the Royal Irish Fusiliers and served in France as an intelligence officer. After the war he returned to lecturing at Oxford, eventually rising to the position of Dean of the Society for non-collegiate students, later known as St Catherine‚Äôs Society. During this time he published several books and papers on climatology. His first book, which he proposed in 1916, The Climates Of The Continents was published in 1922. In 1930 he followed this with Climate: A Treatise On The Principles Of Weather And Climate. He also published papers including a chapter in L.H.D. Buxton's book, China, the Land and the People about the climate of China. In the paper he discussed the impact of dust on life in China. In 1942, he joined the Royal Navy Reserve as a Lieutenant where he was assigned to set up a weather station on Agalega Island in the western Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. The purpose of the station was to give weather reports to the RAF which were operating in the area. During that time he kept up with his writing and scholarly activities. he published a book entitled Weather: An Introductory Meteorology For Airmen in 1942 and performed surveys of flora and fauna on the island. After the war he returned to teaching at Oxford and retired in 1950. He continued his research and accepted an appointment at the University of British Columbia. He also worked for the Canadian Government at the Defence Research Board and the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport. During his time in Canada he published two books on the climate of Canada, The Climate Of Central Canada and The Climate Of British Columbia And The Yukon Territory. Both books were co-authored by Canadian colleagues. He also spent a semester as a visiting professor at the University of Colombo in Ceylon. Personal life Kendrew married Evelyn Sandberg in 1914 and they had one son, John Kendrew, who went on to a distinguished career biochemistry and crystallography, winning a nobel laureate in 1962. Kendrew died in 1962 in Cambridge, England.

The specific epithet saximontana is Latin and means \\"of the Rocky Mountains\\". The grass has a diploid number of 42. Taxonomy Festuca saximontana was reduced by Hult√©n in 1942 to Festuca brachyphylla subsp. saximontana but recognized the species as separate in 1968 on the basis of anther length. In 1982 it was noted that F. saximontana differs from F. brachyphylla in its strongly developed leaf sclerenchyma and longer anthers. The two species are typically distinct, but intermediate specimens with an overlap of anther size, leaf size, and sclerenchyma development occur rarely in the northern areas of the distribution of F. saximontana. Description Festuca saximontana is a bluish-grey to green densely tufted grass that lacks rhizomes. The grass has smooth, glabrous, occasionally scabrous culms growing tall. The culms sometimes become puberulent below the inflorescence. The glabrous and smooth or scabrous leaf sheaths are closed for half of their length and occasionally become shredded. Dead leaf sheaths persist at the base of the grass. The erose ligules measure . The conduplicate leaf blades are in diameter, with glabrous abaxial surfaces and scabrous adaxial surfaces. The abaxial sclerenchyma is composed of three to seven strands that form a continuous band and the adaxial sclerenchyma is absent. The flag leaf blades are long. The panicles are mostly linear- cylindrical and occasionally loosely lanceolate, measuring long. One or two erect branches rise from each node of the inflorescence and become nodding during anthesis, measuring long. The greenish spikelets are loosely flowered with three to five florets and measure . The coriaceous glumes are lance- subulate and become scabrous at their distal end. The lower glumes measure and have one vein, and the upper glumes measure and have three veins. The coriaceous lemmas are strongly curved, the longer of which measure long. The awns measure . The paleas are long. The anthers are long. Distribution and habitat Festuca saximontana grows in dry or mesic grasslands, woodlands, and sand dunes throughout boreal, mountainous, and subalpine North America. It grows at altitudes below . Festuca saximontana occurs from Alaska to Greenland, as far south as California and New Mexico and as far east as the Great Lakes, and is rarely found in the Russian Far East. It has a slightly more southern distribution than Festuca brachyphylla, not occurring in the Arctic circle or some of the Canadian archipelago.

It was established by a Finnish-American family in 1909 and includes seven surviving buildings, including several constructed with traditional Finnish log architecture, and the ruins of a prior settler's log cabin dating to around 1895. With The farm was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 for its state-level significance in the themes of agriculture, architecture, and European ethnic heritage. It was nominated for being one of St. Louis County's best examples of a Finnish- American farm with log architecture, and for its association with Finnish immigration to northeast Minnesota and the conversion of its cutover forests into productive farmland. The property remained an active farm into the 1970s. The Pyhala Farm is owned and maintained by SISU Heritage Inc., a non-profit organization based in Embarrass. It is a stop on the Finnish-American Homestead Tours offered in summers through the Embarrass Information Center. Description At least 12 farm buildings were constructed on the property between the late 1890s and 1945. Still standing are a woodshed (c. 1910), a cattle and hay barn (built in 1928 and enlarged in 1931), a sauna (1924), a horse barn (1929), and a farmhouse (1942‚Äì1945). Two buildings are partially standing in a ruined state: a log cabin built circa 1895 by Charles Matson, an earlier Finnish immigrant who sold the land to the Pyhalas in 1909, and a circa-1910 calf shed. Minus the farmhouse, which is constructed of concrete blocks, each of these log buildings and ruins are considered contributing properties to the historic district.

Vestfold and Telemark in English, is the southernmost county in Eastern Norway that consists of two distinct and separate traditional regions, the former counties of Telemark and most of Vestfold. The county capital is Skien, which is also the county's largest city. While Skien is the capital of the county municipality, the seat of the County Governor is T√∏nsberg. It borders the counties of Viken, Vestland, Rogaland and Agder. Telemark voted against the merger, on the basis that the regions have nothing in common and do not constitute a natural geographical, cultural, social or political entity; regardless the Storting voted on 7 January 2018 to merge the counties by force, and the merger took effect on 1 January 2020. Unlike Telemark or Vestfold, it does not form a traditional or cultural region, but is a purely administrative entity. History The region of Vestfold and Telemark consists of the two former counties of Telemark and Vestfold, whose administrative histories are separate. Telemark County was established in 1919 as a continuation of the former Bratsberg amt, which had been a len and amt since the union with Denmark. Bratsberg amt and the later Telemark county consist of several partly overlapping historic districts. The name Telemark itself did not originally cover the coasts, and the minority at the Storting therefore proposed the name Grenland-Telemark when the modern county was established. Vestfold County was established in 1919 as a continuation of the former Jarlsberg and Larviks amt. The latter was established in 1821 when the counties of Laurvig and Jarlsberg were dissolved and merged into a common county. =The merging process= A possible merger of the counties has been discussed for several years with different constellations. Telemark County Council voted in April 2017 against a merge with Vestfold. Vestfold County Council voted for a merge with both Telemark and Buskerud. The Storting decided a merger of Telemark and Vestfold on 8 June 2017 with effect from 1 January 2020. The Language Council of Norway (Spr√•kr√•det) recommended the name Telemark and Vestfold as the name of the new region. Telemark County Council decided that the name Telemark under any circumstances had to be included in the new name, while Vestfold suggested the name of Vest-Viken, which was criticized because the name was originally created by the Nazi Quisling regime during World War 2 and because Telemark County is mostly located outside the historical Viken area; at best the small coastal area of the county may be included in the periphery of Viken. Media in Norway, such as the state broadcaster NRK, mocked the proposal Vest-Viken as a \\"Nazi name.\\" On 10 November 2017 Vestfold withdrew the proposal of Vest-Viken and it became apparent that both counties supported the Language Council's proposal on Telemark and Vestfold. Eventually the local politicians agreed on Vestfold og Telemark as a compromise, although Telemark politicians stated that Telemark should be the first part of the name, both for alphabetical reasons and because of the Telemark name's iconic status in Norway and internationally, a status that the Vestfold name lacks.Dette er navnene de vil ha p√• det nye storfylket, TelemarksavisaGir opp nazinavn, NRK19 fylker blir til 11 ‚Äì dette skal de hete, nrk.no As of 2018 Telemark og Vestfold is already the name of the relevant branches of several government agenciesTelemark og Vestfold ungdomshjem and both name forms are widely used. As Vestfold was forcibly merged with Telemark, Svelvik municipality decided to vote for a merger with Drammen municipality, which would lead Svelvik to leave Vestfold (Vestfold og Telemark in 2020) county and join Viken county on 1 January 2020.

Bunce (born 1975) is a British space physicist and Professor of Planetary Plasma Physics at the University of Leicester. She holds a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. Her research is on the magnetospheres of Saturn and Jupiter. She is principal investigator (PI) of the MIXS instrument on BepiColombo, was deputy lead on the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer proposal, and co-investigator on the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission. Bunce is the current President of the Royal Astronomical Society; her term began on 26 June 2020 and will run for two years.  Early life and education  Bunce grew up in Worthing. In 1989 she watched the Horizon BBC documentary on Neptune with images taken by Voyager 2 and was inspired to become a space scientist. She was educated at Davison High School (a C of E girls school) and Worthing College (a sixth form college), where she graduated in 1994. She studied physics with space science at the University of Leicester and earned her Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in 1998. In 1998 Bunce began her doctoral training with Stan Cowley, investigating the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Her thesis, Large-scale current systems in the Jovian Magnetosphere, looked at the radial current systems of the middle magnetosphere of Jupiter. She used data from Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2 and Ulysses. The interaction between Jupiter and the surrounding plasma environment is influenced by the magnetic field. On Jupiter, the plasma is mainly produced in the volcanic moon Io.  Research and career  After her graduate studies, Bunce worked as a postdoctoral researcher investigating the Kronian magnetosphere of Saturn in preparation for Cassini‚ÄìHuygens. In 2003 Bunce was awarded a Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council fellowship to study the magnetosphere of Saturn. She continued to study Jupiter's polar auroral emissions. She was appointed to the faculty at the University of Leicester in 2005. Bunce was part of the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens magnetometer team. She was the first to analyse the UV aurorae of Saturn using the Hubble Space Telescope. The magnetosphere of Saturn rotates rapidly and plasma is produced via sputter of the icy moons. She monitored the magnetospheric currents of Saturn in situ, identifying that there was a connection between the auroral oval and upward-directed field- aligned currents that flow near open and closed field lines. She observed the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere of Saturn. In 2009 she was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society Council and delivered the society's Harold Jeffreys Lecture. She discussed her work Jupiter-like aurorae found on saturn. She was promoted to reader in 2009 and professor in 2013. She organised a celebration of ten years of Cassini‚ÄìHuygens in 2014. She is the Principal Investigator of the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) instrument. MIXS was built in Leicester, launched in 2015 and will travel to Mercury. She delivered the 2016 National Space Academy keynote lecture. She is the principal investigator on the European Space Agency BepiColombo mission (to Mercury) and deputy lead on the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer.

This is a modified design of CZ-75 and Tanfoglio pistol models. Concept and design has been registered and claimed by FK Brno. History According to the manufacturer, the pistol was under development since 2011. The designers wanted a handgun that could be concealed yet could provide accurate shots out to 100 meters with a flat trajectory. The development parameters included: * Its overall length must be small enough so that it can be loaded and shot in a standard civilian size and weight double-stack magazine-fed pistol; * A barrel length of 6 inches (152 mm); there must be enough room for the powder charge to propel the bullet to its maximum potential velocity; * Recoil energy should not exceed that of a hot .45 ACP +P load. * The bullet should have enough speed to consistently hit a 100√ó100 mm (3.93-sq.in.) target at 100 meters. * The bullet's terminal performance at 100 meters must be enough to take down a 330-lb. living target utilizing hydrostatic shock; * The target's permanent wound cavity should measure a minimum of 35mm in diameter (roughly 1.38 inches wide) and 300mm in length (roughly 11.81 inches long) Due to these specifications, FK BRNO had to design the 7.5 FK round from scratch. FK Brno first showcased the Field Pistol at the IWA 2015 expo. Design details The 7.5 FK Field Pistol is a single action, tilting barrel type mechanism, with a proprietary recoil attenuating system. Another unique feature are the \\"butterfly\\" sights designed by FK BRNO, designed to give the shooter a larger view of the target area and to automatically align with the front sight, and is adjustable for windage. This double stack magazine fed automatic pistol has general dimensions and weight similar to current standard issue steel military pistols. Proprietary cartridge and projectile have a proven effective range in terms of accuracy and terminal ballistics of at least 100 meters (110 yards) against targets that weight up to 150 kg (330 lbs) while maintaining low recoil and controllability. Single hand use ability. Rapid acquisition sight system that does not require adjustment within the range spectrum. The manufacturer claims that the pistol is very ergonomic and even though the magazine holds 15-35 mm long rounds, the smallest hands are able to fully wrap around the optimally angled grip of the pistol. The cartridge produces roughly 850 foot pounds (~1150 joules). In comparison, 9x19 parabellum and 45 ACP produce ~360ft/lbs (~488j), 10mm produces 700ft/lbs (960j), and 44 magnum produces 1,100ft/lbs (~1500j) References 2011 establishments in the Czech Republic 2011 establishments in the United States Short recoil firearms ","title":"FK BRNO Field Pistol"},{"id":"58494709","text":"Events from the year 1844 in China.

With Emmy Noether, Hilda Geiringer, Ruth Moufang, and Hel Braun, Geppert was one of only a handful of women to work in mathematics in Germany before World War II and later convert their degrees into research careers as full professors. Early life and education Geppert was born in Breslau, with Italian descent through her mother. Breslau is now Wroc≈Çaw, in Poland, but at that time it was part of the German Empire. Her older brother, also became a mathematician, and a supporter of the Nazis. She studied mathematics in Breslau and in Giessen, and in 1932 completed a doctorate at the University of Breslau. Her dissertation, Approximative Darstellungen analytischer Funktionen, die durch Dirichletsche Reihen gegeben sind, concerned analytic number theory and was supervised by Guido Hoheisel. Edmund Landau, in his last publication before Hitler came to power, commented unfavorably on one of her papers. Next, Geppert moved to Rome, where from 1933 to 1936 she studied actuarial science and statistics for a second doctorate under the supervision of Guido Castelnuovo.

Life Hansj√∂rg Eichler, the son of architect, Gustav Eichler, and painter, Anna Eichler (n√©e Sellin), was born in Ravensburg in 1916. At the Ravensburg school, one of his teachers was Karl Bertsch, a leading W√ºrttemberg botanist, who stimulated his interest in botany and took him on private botanical excursions. In 1936, the family moved to Berlin, and Eichler started working at the Botanisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem (as a volunteer) under the tutelage of Friedrich Ludwig E Diels, at the same time having enrolled at the University of Berlin, to study botany and chemistry. The work at the Botanisches Museum ceased in 1943 when a bombing raid wrecked the museum. In 1944, he was exempted from war service to allow him to both study and work at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Kulturpflanzenforschung (now the Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung) in Vienna. After the war (1946‚Äì1949), he was able to continue his studies at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, and, in 1950, received his Doctorate in Natural Sciences for a thesis on floristic and phyto-oenological investigations into the Hakel. He married Marie-Louise M√∂hring in 1953, and went to Parma, and from there to the Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum Naturalis in Leiden, to work on Ranunculaceae. In 1955, he was appointed the first Keeper of the State Herbarium of South Australia (1955‚Äì1972), and then curator of the Herbarium Australiense (which later became the Australian National Herbarium), within the CSIRO division of Plant Industry, a position held from 1973 until his retirement in 1981. In Canberra, he founded the journal, Brunonia. In 1993 the Australian Systematic Botany Society established the Hansj√∂rg Eichler Research Fund in his honour, and makes awards for projects contributing to Australian systematic botany. His personal herbarium of over 24, 000 specimens was divided between the State Herbarium of South Australia and the Australian National Herbarium.

It was formed in 2016 and the current chair is Amy Walden. The current head of pastoral support at Humanists UK is Simon O'Donoghue who was responsible for developing the organisation. Six other people make up the governing board within the constitution of the organisation. History NRPSN was set up in 2016 as part of Humanists UK under the name Humanist Care. It originated partly in response to a British Social Attitudes Survey which concluded that 53% of people in Britain considered themselves to have no religion, and from what Humanists UK perceived to be a huge demand for trained non-religious people in the field of pastoral care to meet the needs of this demographic, both as recipients and providers of care. People within the organisation refer to themselves as a ‚Äúnon-religious pastoral carer‚Äù rather than the traditional equivalent, chaplain, which is deemed to have religious overtones, and this led to the name Non-Religious Pastoral Support Network. Humanist Care now remains as the website for general enquiry and NRPSN for accredited volunteers and professionals and is headed by Jessica Grace Non-religious pastoral care in the UK Following an equality analysis by NHS England, within the NHS pastoral care provision is covered by guidelines drawn up by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to ensure equality and standards of practice are met in the provision of spiritual and religious care in, for example, hospitals and hospices. In 2018, palliative care charity Marie Curie released a report which highlighted some of the deficits in pastoral care provision which included provision for people with learning disabilities, dementia and people with no religion. The three-year project which covered terminal patients in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan summarised, \\"Many non-religious participants felt that concerns around how we provide spiritual care for the non- religious would be a barrier to their access to care. People said they fear ‚Äúreligious evangelism and attempts to convert during times of extreme emotional stress‚Äù or simply a lack of any provision of support for non-religious people based on an assumption that they would not need spiritual support.\\" The appointment of the first ever humanist pastoral carer and member of NRPSN, Jane Flint, within the chaplaincy at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust took place on 4 January 2016. Flint's post was originally funded by Leicester Hospitals Charity but since January 2017 has been funded by the NHS. In April 2018 Lindsay van Dijk, quality assurance officer and board member of NRPSN, was appointed the first non-religious head chaplain at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust. Van Dijk's appointment was criticised by Tim Dieppe of Christian pressure group Christian Concern who said \\"It's a further move away from the Christian principles upon which the NHS was founded.\\" Elsewhere, Humanists UK has pointed out that the NHS's founders (Bevan, Attlee, and Beveridge) were in fact self-identified humanists. In the UK, NHS trusts are required to fund and account for chaplains according to the demographic of the population served by the trust. Canon Michael Brown (Church of England) said \\"those appointing chaplains have to give a clear reason if an appointment is specifically designated as requiring someone of a particular religious denomination or belief. This might be to reflect, for example, the makeup of the local population.\\" British military pastoral care is provided by the Royal Army Chaplains' Department, Royal Air Force Chaplains Branch and Royal Navy Chaplaincy Service. As of 2018 there are no non-religious 'chaplains' in the British armed forces which the NRPSN continues to advocate for in conjunction with the Defence Humanists. Following an initial pilot programme at HMP Winchester, NRPSN now has volunteers working within Winchester prison and across several other British prisons, and is working with the National Offender Management Service to increase provision although numbers have not been published.

He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1857 to 1859 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Carrickfergus. Early life and family Born in Belfast, Dobbs was the only son of five children of Reverend Robert Conway Dobbs and Wilhelmina Josepha n√©e Bristow. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with a wrangler's degree in 1827, and a Master of Arts in 1830, before being called to the bar in 1833. He married Elinor Jones Westropp, daughter of Henry Sheares Westropp, in 1834 and they had five children: Elinor Dobbs (1838‚Äì1892); Wilhelmena Josepha Dobbs (1840‚Äì1842); Robert Conway Dobbs (1842‚Äì1915); Charity Frances Dobbs (1846‚Äì1893); and Henry Sheares Dobbs. In 1851, he became a crown prosecutor for Drogheda and Dundalk on the Irish north-eastern circuit, before being elevated to a Queen's Counsel in 1858. Member of Parliament Ahead of the 1857 general election, Dobbs was selected as the Conservative candidate for Carrickfergus, a seat for which his grandfather, Conway Richard Dobbs had represented in the Parliament of Ireland and his cousin, also named Conway Richard Dobbs, had represented from 1832 to 1833. His candidature was successful and, in Parliament, he promoted free trade, and, as an Anglican promised constituents he would uphold Protestantism and protect the constitution. He sought clarification of the law on tenant rights, and favoured ending the Maynooth Grant, arguing public money should not be used to support the church. While he was also supported an extension of the education and the franchise, he was cautious about the Irish national school system and felt religion should feature high in education. Just before the 1859 general election, Dobbs was made a judge in the landed estates court in Dublin, making him ineligible to stand at the election, ending his political career after one term. Death While seeking medical attention in London in 1869, Dobbs died. By this time, he had become a senior judge of the court, recognised by the public for his \\"amiable character... intelligent and cultivated mind... [and] the consistency and uprightness of his conduct\\". His body was later returned to Dublin, before being interred at the family burying-ground near Carrickfergus.

The film stars Alexandra Daddario, Keean Johnson, Maddie Hasson, Amy Forsyth, Logan Miller, Austin Swift, and Johnny Knoxville. The film premiered at Mammoth Film Festival on February 28, 2019, and was released in digital and on-demand in the United States on April 10, 2020, by Saban Films. Plot In Indiana, July 1988, Alexis Butler and her two friends Val and Bev are driving to a heavy metal show, when a milkshake is thrown from a blue van onto their windshield. Once they arrive at the concert, they find the same blue van, and Val throws a small firecracker into it, causing the three boys inside to climb out. Ivan owns the van and his buddies Kovacs and Mark, who is said to be leaving for Los Angeles soon, are interested in the girls. After the show, Alexis invites the boys to her father's empty mansion. Bev and Mark seem to like each other, yet Bev seems to almost avoid him. As they play a game of Never Have I Ever, the girls drug the boys' drinks and reveal they are going to murder them and make it look like a Satanic cult killing. The Daughters of the Dawn, the church the girls are a part of, has murdered eighteen other people in the same way in order to create fear and send more people to their religion. Alexis is shown to be the most insane and stabs Ivan after he criticizes her religious belief in Christ, and he bleeds to death. Mark and Kovacs briefly escape, hiding in a pantry. Susan, Alexis's soon-to-be ex-stepmother, comes home to retrieve a passport and reveals she has called the police because she saw the strange blue van and the house lights on. Susan then discovers Ivan's body and Alexis stabs her to death. A police officer arrives and becomes suspicious, so Alexis runs from him and back into the house where he chases her, gun raised. The officer finds the injured Kovacs and Mark who pleads for help, but Val sneaks up on him, takes his gun, and shoots him, killing him. As Alexis and Val fight over the gun, Bev appears, threatening her friends with an electric outboard trolling motor. Val and Alexis tell Bev they are doing the Lord's work, but Bev declares she will let Mark and Kovacs go. Bev tries to help Mark and Kovacs, the latter who is bleeding out and will not last much longer unless he makes it to a hospital. Alexis has the car keys, so Mark goes after her to retrieve them. When Kovacs sees car lights, he goes outside struggling to walk to find John Henry Butler, Alexis's father and the pastor of the Daughters of the Dawn. Mark obtains the keys, but Alexis attacks him and they fight. Val attacks Bev and tries to kill her, but Bev lights Val on fire (her hair being full of hairspray). Butler attacks Kovacs off-screen and he makes it back into the house where Bev finds him. Just before Kovacs dies, he tells Bev to save Mark. Butler shoots Mark as he is strangling Alexis. He then berates his daughter for doing a terrible job murdering and covering it up. He tells Alexis they have to make some sacrifices to get out of the predicament she has caused and attempts to strangle her to death when Bev comes up and knocks him out. Alexis is over-the-top crazy and Bev throws her out of a window in a dramatic and exaggerated fashion. Mark is still alive, and he drives away with Bev, only to find Alexis standing in the road. Off-camera, Bev runs Alexis over. Butler is still alive and makes himself into a victim, claiming that Alexis was led astray and joined a Satanic cult. Bev and Mark leave town together.

It was early 2017 when Adhikari and the company premiered their magnum opus Code Red - a theatre and dance presentation, adapted from Rabindranath Tagore's poem Sishutirtha (Bengali: ‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶§‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶• ), and directed by Sinha. Adhikari served as ensemble member, production manager, and assistant director to this critically hailed production, which travelled nationally as part of the 8th Theatre Olympics in Bhopal, India (2018) and the fifth C.G.K. Rashtriya Rangothsava in Bengaluru, India (2018). Adhikari had his directorial debut at the Short and Sweet theatre festival in Kolkata in 2015 with a ten-minute play titled One Two Three. In 2016, Adhikari had his maiden silver screen venture as an actor in the critically acclaimed Bengali film Tope - The Bait, directed by Buddhadeb Dasgupta, which travelled to the Toronto International Film Festival, the 60th BFI London Film Festival, and the 21st Busan International Film Festival. In 2017, Adhikari had his debut in the commercial Bengali Film Industry as a supporting character in Birsa Dasgupta's One. Adhikari has also featured in independent Bengali short films, notable among which are Niruddesh/Adrift (Bengali: ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂; directed by Saptarshi Bhattacharya) and Banshi (Bengali: ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Å‡¶∂‡¶ø; directed by Kaushik Sengupta). In 2018, Niruddesh/Adrift, with Adikari in the lead, was selected and screened as part of the Hyderabad Bengali Film Festival in Hyderabad, India, the India Shorts Competition organised by the 9th Jagran Film Festival in Delhi, India, and an international screening organised by The Tannenbusch House in Bonn, Germany. In 2019, Niruddesh/Adrift was selected to be screened as part of the Second South Asian Short Film Festival in Kolkata, India. Adhikari, along with Behala Project Prometheus, premiered a Bengali theatre production in 2018 titled Jara Jege Thake (Bengali: ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶ó‡ßá ‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá), with allegorical references to the present political climate in West Bengal and India.

The church and monastery are dedicated to Our Lady of Monserrate and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia. It is located from the Fort of Monserrate (Fortim de Nossa Senhora de Monserrate) on a rock on the Itapagipe Peninsula. The date of construction of the structure is disputed; it dates to the 16th century, and has seen numerous alterations. The church was built either by the Spanish, or by the group that constructed the Garcia d'√Åvila Tower House. Its design, along with that of numerous rural chapels of Bahia, is attributed to the Italian architect Baccio da Filicaia (1565-1628). The church interior was once lined entirely with 16th-century azulejos; now only a single strip of the tiles remain. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1958. It and the Chapel of Our Lady of the Ladder are the only remaining 16th-century chapels in Salvador. History The Fort and Church of Our Lady of Monserrate sits at a strategic location north of the historic center of Salvador with a view over the Bay of All Saints. The site, originally called Traripe, was naturally protected by land by the small line of hills in the Itapagipe Peninsula. Additionally, its small cove has calmer waters than the Bay of All Saints. The Itapagipe Peninsula also had several waterfalls that provided fresh water and hills rich in timber. According to records in the archive of the Church and Monastery of Saint Benedict (Igreja e Mosteiro de S√£o Bento), Tom√© de Sousa (1503-1579), the first governor-general of Brazil, donated land to the Benedictines near Fort Monserrate to construct a chapel. A source dating to 1722 states that the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mont-Serrat (Santu√°rio da Senhora de Mont-Serrat) was founded by Spanish priests under the orders of Garcia Dias de √Åvila, son of Tom√© de Sousa; these fathers dedicated the chapel to Our Lady of Monserrate, the patron saint of Catalonia. Location The Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate is located on the small, westernmost point of the Itapagipe Peninsula called Monte Serrat. The church and convent sit below the fort. The chapel is surrounded by water on all three sides and accessed via a narrow road. Protected status The Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938.

He briefly served as president of Washington Seminary, and later became the first Catholic chaplain in the United States Navy, albeit unofficially.  Biography  Adam Marshall was born on November 18, 1785, in Conewago, Pennsylvania, to Francis Marshall and Ann Margaret Staub; he had two sisters named Margaret and Catherine. As a Jesuit priest, he first served in 1818 at St. Patrick's Church in York, Pennsylvania, and later worked in New York, the southern counties of Maryland, and at Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. Marshall became the most powerful figure in the Jesuit mission in Maryland, eventually becoming the Procurator of the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen of Maryland during the suppression of the Society of Jesus. In 1822, he was stationed at Washington Seminary (which later became Gonzaga College High School) and was placed in charge of the worldly affairs of the Jesuit mission in Maryland. In the beginning of 1824, Marshall was appointed the second president of Washington Seminary, succeeding Anthony Kohlmann. During his presidency, the students of the Seminary partook in the first civic procession in Washington by joining in the commemoration of the Declaration of Independence on the Fourth of July of 1824. While president, Marshall also gave a speech at Georgetown College during a reception for the Marquis de Lafayette, with his students in attendance. Marshall became ill with tuberculosis, which affected his lungs. His physicians advised that he take a reprieve from duties at the school and recommended he undertake a sea voyage. Through the intervention of Commodore John Rogers, whose two sons were students at Gonzaga, Marshall obtained a position in the United States Navy. He was succeeded as president of the school by William Matthews. Marshall was commissioned an officer in 1824 and was assigned to the USS North Carolina, a ship of the line. His official position was schoolmaster to the midshipmen, but he unofficially doubled as chaplain to the Catholic sailors, making him the first Catholic chaplain in the United States Navy. The religious services on board were conducted by an Episcopalian minister whose sermons Marshall noted that he admired, and Marshall was not permitted to say Mass; rather, his duty was to counsel and hear confession. The North Carolina left port in Norfolk, Virginia, on December 1, 1824, for a cruise of the Mediterranean. In the final entry of Marshall's diary, the lieutenant of the watch notes that while underway, at 2:30 a.m. on September 20, 1825, during the voyage from Naples to Gibraltar, the priest died of his disease. He was buried at sea at 10 a.m. with all hands on deck. On October 22, Commodore Rogers communicated the news to the Secretary of the Navy.

The self-similar solution appears whenever the problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale (for example, self-similar solution describes Blasius boundary layer of an infinite plate, but not the finite-length plate). These include, for example, the Blasius boundary layer or the Sedov-Taylor shell.Gratton, J. (1991). Similarity and self similarity in fluid dynamics. Fundamentals of Cosmic Physics, 15, 1-106.Barenblatt, Grigory Isaakovich. Scaling, self- similarity, and intermediate asymptotics: dimensional analysis and intermediate asymptotics. Vol. 14. Cambridge University Press, 1996. Concept A powerful tool in physics is the concept of dimensional analysis and scaling laws. By examining the physical effects present in a system, we may estimate their size and hence which, for example, might be neglected. In some cases, the system may not have a fixed natural lengthscale (timescale) while the solution depends on space (time). It is then necessary to construct a lengthscale (timescale) using space (time) and the other dimensional quantities present - such as the viscosity u. These constructs are not 'guessed' but are derived immediately from the scaling of the governing equations. Classification The normal self-similar solution is also referred to as self-similar solution of the first kind since another type of self-similar exists for finite-sized problems, which cannot be derived from dimensional analysis, known as self-similar solution of the second kind. The discovery of solution of the second kind was due to Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich, who also named it as second kind in 1956.Zeldovich, Y. B. (1956). The motion of a gas under the action of a short term pressure shock. Akust. zh, 2(1), 28-38.

Example - Rayleigh problem  A simple example is a semi-infinite domain bounded by a rigid wall and filled with viscous fluid.Batchelor (2006 edition), An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, p189 At time t=0 the wall is made to move with constant speed U in a fixed direction (for definiteness, say the x direction and consider only the x-y plane), one can see that there is no distinguished length scale given in the problem. This is known as the Rayleigh problem. The boundary conditions of no-slip is u = U on y = 0 Also, the condition that the plate has no effect on the fluid at infinity is enforced as u rightarrow 0 as y rightarrow infty . Now, from the Navier-Stokes equations rho left( dfrac{partial vec{u}}{partial t} + vec{u} cdot abla vec{u} right) =- abla p + mu abla^{2} vec{u} one can observe that this flow will be rectilinear, with gradients in the y direction and flow in the x direction, and that the pressure term will have no tangential component so that dfrac{partial p}{partial y} = 0. The x component of the Navier-Stokes equations then becomes dfrac{partial vec{u}}{partial t} = u partial^{2}_{y} vec{u} and the scaling arguments can be applied to show that frac{U}{t} sim u frac{U}{y^{2}} which gives the scaling of the y co-ordinate as y sim ( u t)^{1/2}. This allows one to pose a self-similar ansatz such that, with f and eta dimensionless, u = U f left( eta equiv dfrac{y}{( u t)^{1/2}} right) The above contains all the relevant physics and the next step is to solve the equations, which for many cases will include numerical methods. This equation is - eta f'/2 = f with solution satisfying the boundary conditions that f = 1 - operatorname{erf} (eta / 2) or u = U left(1 - operatorname{erf} left(- y / (4 u t)^{1/2} right)right) which is a self-similar solution of the first kind.

The college would later become the University of Texas at Arlington in 1965. His tenure included the expansion of the school system, the changing nature of the school away from primarily-agricultural studies, Cold War-era \\"Citizenship classes\\" being promoted via the state government, as well as the spearheading the change of the school theme from 'Blue Riders' to the 'Rebels' in 1951. Early life Hereford was born in 1894 in Burnet, Texas. After graduating from Robert E. Lee High School in Burnet, Texas he went to Southwestern University. From 1916 to 1921 he was a ward school principal and athletic coach in the Llano Public School. From 1921 until 1932 he was a college professor at Southwestern University and the University of Texas in Austin. From 1932 to 1938 he was the superintendent of schools, and President of the Municipal Junior College at Corpus Christi. Hereford also established the Corpus Christi Junior College in 1935. From 1938 to 1941 he was the State College Examiner and Curriculum Director for the State Department of Education in Austin, Texas. In 1941 he became the Dean of the Staff and Director of Public Relations at the Hockaday School of Dallas. Since 1942, Hereford has been associated with attached to the-then North Texas Agricultural College. First brought on as Registrar, then promoted by then-Dean E. E. Davis as Associate Dean in 1943, and finally promoted to Dean in 1946 as Davis retired. In 1949, the college was transformed into the Arlington State College, or ASC, and E. H. Hereford became its first President in the newly reorganized Texas A&M; system.Saxon, Gerald D. Transitions, A Centennial History of The University of Texas at Arlington. The UTA Press, 1995, p. 65; University of Texas at Arlington, Office of the President Records, AR258, Series III, Box 34, Folder 8, Special Collections, The University of Texas at Arlington Libraries The Rebel Theme In the summer of 1951, Hereford set up a committee comprising Colonel Edgar H. Keltner, Miss Melba Hammack, Colonel Earl D. Irons, Cothburn M. O‚ÄôNeal and several students to discuss changes to the theme and mascot of the school. Hereford felt that the students did not really appreciate the then-current 'Blue Riders' as a team or a theme of the school. Two candidates were to be presented to the student body at the first fall weekly assembly in 1951 - the 'Cadets', and the 'Rebels'. Regardless of the choice, a song was already written by Colonel Earl D. Irons and Cothburn O‚ÄôNeal named 'Fight on, Rebels!' or 'Fight on, Cadets!' depending on the choice of the students. On September 18, 1951 the fall assembly chose the 'Rebels' as their mascot as a unanimous-decision. Hereford stressed, as President, that the student body would need to be content with their decision and fully adopt 'Johnny Rebel' as their school mascot - and personally remarking that he \\"did not much care for the Blue Riders, anyway\\". In the following week the school set up a 'Draw Johnny Rebel' contest that would last from September 25 until September 27, as a school document stressed that ASC students must have the Rebel ‚Äúbecome a living symbol and part of our tradition...the ASC REBEL must become a reality ‚Äì one that all will recognize.‚Äù Hereford adopted the \\"Rebel Flag\\" as the symbol of ASC in 1952 In 1951 the second issue of the Shorthorn, dated late September, fully featuring a cartoon that showed a Robert E. Lee caricature carrying the Confederate Beauregard Battle Flag stirring the new-ASC ‚ÄòRebs‚Äô in a football game. As 1951 went on, the ‚ÄúFight on, Rebels!‚Äù song was dropped by the band during football games, and \\"Dixie's Land\\" would be the new school fight song although unofficial. In November 1951, Hereford appointed a committee, with C. M. O‚ÄôNeal as its chair, to begin the adoption of Rebels iconography, the creation of Rebel and Belle organizations, and the dressing of these organizations in self-described 'antebellum' uniforms. The Shorthorn reported on November 17, 1951 that the first Homecoming in several years would feature a ‚ÄúRebel float‚Äù, sporting the Beauregard Battle Flag as its main insignia. In 1952, ACS had the Beauregard Battle Flag made the official school symbol.Saxon, Gerald D. Transitions, A Centennial History of The University of Texas at Arlington. The UTA Press, 1995, p. 112-3. The flag would also, in military parades henceforth, be flown alongside the United States flag, as well as the A&M; system flag in any gatherings like Homecoming or football games. Death Hereford suffered a heart attack on July 22, 1958, a second heart attack led to his death on November 24, 1958. The Texas A&M; System named then-Dean Jack Woolf of ASC acting President until he was confirmed President in 1959. The Reveille Annual for 1959 dedicated a page eulogizing Hereford, and in 1960 dedicated a page to the ‚ÄòE. H. Hereford Memorial‚Äô - now known as the E. H. Hereford Statue, which resides in the E. H. Hereford University Center. The statue, sculpted by alumnus Edward C. Brown, was planned as early as October 21, 1958 by a committee consisting of E. C. Barksdale, Miss Woulida Piner, Colonel Kirk P. Brock, Lloyd Lasen, and Cothburn O‚ÄôNeal.Shorthorn Microfilms, September 29, 1953-August 13th, 1958, UTA Libraries The University Center, then the ‚ÄòStudent Union building‚Äô, was named via a decision from the board of regions of the A&M; System on February 28, 1959.Shorthorn Microfilms, Shorthorn issue March 2, 1959, UTA Library On November 23, 1959.

Legacy E.H. Hereford University Center on the UTA campus, named in honor of Hereford Hereford served as President during the changing nature of the school from a predominant agricultural college, North Texas Agricultural College, to a preeminent junior college, Arlington State College. Through his efforts and pushes for legislation ASC would become a four-year institution, although this was six months after his death. He, likewise, was paramount in the changing atmosphere on campus: he spearheaded the adoption of Confederate iconography for the school. As early as October 1951, students could be seen waving the Beauregard Battle Flag of the Confederacy. His leadership saw the development of Confederacy-related traditions and icons of ASC: the ‚ÄúASC Rebs‚Äù, ‚ÄúMiss Dixie Bell‚Äù, the Confederate Battle Flag as the school symbol, Confederate symbols on all uniforms, celebration of Edward Emmet Rankin s part of Nathan Forrest's Raiders in the Civil War and founder of what would become NTAC-ASC, ‚ÄúOld South Week‚ÄùRebel Theme Controversy Collection, Box 1, Folder 2 (including mock-slave auctions) Saxon, Gerald D.

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Good Journey and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia. It is located on the Itapagipe Peninsula and faces west directly onto the Bay of All Saints. The Church and Hospice of Our Lady of the Good Journey has a single tower with a frontispiece covered in blue and white azulejos in a zigzag pattern. It was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) in 1938. History The Church and Hospice of Our Lady of the Good Journey was built on land on the Itapagipe Peninsula donated by Louren√ßo Maria to the Franciscan Order in 1710. The site is a short distance from the Small Fort of Our Lady of Monserrate and faces the Bay of All Saints. The brick and mortar church structure was built in 1712; it consisted of a nave with side aisles and tribunes, a plan typical of Bahian churches of the 17th and 18th century. The walls of church were completed between 1743 and 1746. Work on interior elements of the church were completed throughout the 18th century. The main altar dates to 1720. Its authorship is unknown, but is similar in style and execution to that of the Church of S√£o Francisco, also owned by the Franciscan Order and completed in the same period. The altar and wood interior elements of the church were damaged over time by xylophages. =20th century= The church was greatly disfigured in the early 20th century. In a renovation between 1908 and 1912 the walls separating the nave from the side corridors were demolished and the azulejos removed. The single nave was divided into three naves. The walls were replaced by pillars made of iron tubes. The fine jacaranda altar rail, similar to those found in Bahian churches, was demolished. The floor of the nave was lowered. The five arches of the northwest fa√ßade were covered. The National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) carried out stabilization and conservation works after the its designation as a historic structure in 1938. Stabilization work began in 1942. Worked moved to the chapel in 1944. The roof was restored beginning in 1955. The work was concluded in 1959 and the bell gable pyramid was restored in the same year. Structure The Church and Hospice of Our Lady of the Good Journey consists of a church and hospice building. The church has a baroque- style fa√ßade with a single bell tower. An elaborate stone portal is at center with three sash windows at the choir level. The central pediment is covered in azulejos manufactured in Portugal. The belfry has a pyramid decorated in azulejos arranged in a zigzag pattern. The hospice has two floors built around a courtyard. Much of the baroque-style high altar and retable date to the early 18th century; the central elements of the retable were added in the 19th and 20th century. The sacristy has its original set of jacaranda furniture, including a sacristy cabinet and trunks. The sacristy has a lavabo in white marble; it has dolphin motifs and a shell-shaped washbasin, similar to other lavabos in Bahia of the same period. Protected status The Church and Hospice of Our Lady of the Good Journey was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938.

See p. 35 * Descriptio Indi√¶, by Joseph Tiefenthaler Main schools In recent decades there have been four main schools of historiography in how historians study India: Cambridge, Nationalist, Marxist, and subaltern. The once common \\"persian\\" approach, with its image of a sensuous, inscrutable, and wholly spiritual India, has died out in serious scholarship. The \\"Cambridge School\\", led by Anil Seal,Anil Seal, The Emergence of Indian Nationalism: Competition and Collaboration in the Later Nineteenth Century (1971) Gordon Johnson,Gordon Johnson, Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism: Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880‚Äì1915 (2005) Richard Gordon, and David A. Washbrook,Rosalind O'Hanlon and David Washbrook, eds. Religious Cultures in Early Modern India: New Perspectives (2011) downplays ideology.Aravind Ganachari, \\"Studies in Indian Historiography: 'The Cambridge School'\\", Indica, March 2010, 47#1, pp 70‚Äì93 However, this school of historiography is criticised for western bias or Eurocentrism. The Nationalist school has focused on Congress, Gandhi, Nehru and high level politics. It highlighted the Mutiny of 1857 as a war of liberation, and Gandhi's 'Quit India' begun in 1942, as defining historical events. This school of historiography has received criticism for Elitism. The Marxists have focused on studies of economic development, landownership, and class conflict in precolonial India and of deindustrialisation during the colonial period. The Marxists portrayed Gandhi's movement as a device of the bourgeois elite to harness popular, potentially revolutionary forces for its own ends. Again, the Marxists are accused of being \\"too much\\" ideologically influenced. The \\"subaltern school\\", was begun in the 1980s by Ranajit Guha and Gyan Prakash. It focuses attention away from the elites and politicians to \\"history from below\\", looking at the peasants using folklore, poetry, riddles, proverbs, songs, oral history and methods inspired by anthropology. It focuses on the colonial era before 1947 and typically emphasises caste and downplays class, to the annoyance of the Marxist school. More recently, Hindu nationalists have created a version of history to support their demands for \\"Hindutva\\" (\\"Hinduness\\") in Indian society. This school of thought is still in the process of development. In March 2012, Diana L. Eck, professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, authored in her book \\"India: A Sacred Geography\\", that idea of India dates to a much earlier time than the British or the Mughals and it wasn't just a cluster of regional identities and it wasn't ethnic or racial. Debate continues about the economic impact of British imperialism on India. The issue was actually raised by conservative British politician Edmund Burke who in the 1780s vehemently attacked the East India Company, claiming that Warren Hastings and other top officials had ruined the Indian economy and society. Indian historian Rajat Kanta Ray (1998) continues this line of attack, saying the new economy brought by the British in the 18th century was a form of \\"plunder\\" and a catastrophe for the traditional economy of Mughal India. Ray accuses the British of depleting the food and money stocks and imposing high taxes that helped cause the terrible famine of 1770, which killed a third of the people of Bengal.Rajat Kanta Ray, \\"Indian Society and the Establishment of British Supremacy, 1765‚Äì1818\\", in The Oxford History of the British Empire: vol. 2, The Eighteenth Century, ed. P. J. Marshall, (1998), pp. 508‚Äì529. Rejecting the Indian nationalist account of the British as alien aggressors, seizing power by brute force and impoverishing all of India, British historian P. J. Marshall argues that the British were not in full control but instead were players in what was primarily an Indian play and in which their rise to power depended upon excellent cooperation with Indian elites. Marshall admits that much of his interpretation is still rejected by many historians.P. J. Marshall, \\"The British in Asia: Trade to Dominion, 1700‚Äì1765,\\" in The Oxford History of the British Empire: vol. 2, The Eighteenth Century, ed. P. J. Marshall, (1998), pp. 487‚Äì507. Marshall argues that recent scholarship has reinterpreted the view that the prosperity of the formerly benign Mughal rule gave way to poverty and anarchy. Marshall argues the British takeover did not make any sharp break with the past. The British largely delegated control to regional Mughal rulers and sustained a generally prosperous economy for the rest of the 18th century. Marshall notes the British went into partnership with Indian bankers and raised revenue through local tax administrators and kept the old Mughal rates of taxation. Professor Ray agrees that the East India Company inherited an onerous taxation system that took one-third of the produce of Indian cultivators.Marshall, \\"The British in Asia: Trade to Dominion, 1700‚Äì1765\\" =Insecurity of the Raj= In the 20th century historians generally agreed that imperial authority in the Raj had been secure in the 1800-1940 era. Various challenges have emerged. Mark Condos and Jon Wilson argue that the Raj was chronically insecure.Mark Condos, The Insecurity State: Punjab and the Making of Colonial Power in British India (Cambridge University Press, 2017).Jon Wilson, India conquered: Britain's Raj and the chaos of empire (Simon and Schuster, 2016). They argue that the irrational anxiety of officials led to a chaotic administration with minimal social purchase or ideological coherence. The Raj was not a confident state capable of acting as it chose, but rather a psychologically embattled one incapable of acting except in the abstract, the small scale, or short term.Joshua Ehrlich, \\"Anxiety, Chaos, and the Raj.\\" Historical Journal 63.3 (2020): 777-787.

This model still featured three high points The Elbtower is a planned high-rise building east of the HafenCity borough in Hamburg, Germany. At the time of the presentation of the mostly finalised design, on February 8th, 2018, the Elbtower with its planned height of 233.3 metersSIGNA baut Elbtower nach Entwurf von David Chipperfield Architects Berlin. would be by far the highest conventional building in Hamburg, and the third highest in Germany ‚Äì after the Commerzbank Tower and the Messeturm (both in Frankfurt am Main). The design was developed by Christoph Felger who works at the office of English architect David Chipperfield, who has already realized a lower high-rise project in Hamburg, namely the Empire Riverside Hotel. The design was presented by Hamburg‚Äôs then First Mayor Olaf Scholz as well as representatives of the HafenCity Hamburg GmbH and its investors.  Location  The building is supposed to be built on a prominent urban site on the north bank of the Norderelbe river and thus mark the entrance to the inner city. The site is bordered by several bridges crossing the Norderelbe. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2021 with a projected completion in 2025.‚ÄûElbtower ‚Äú ‚Äì Eine elegante Hochhaus-Ikone f√ºr Hamburg. .  Architectural details  The Elbtower covers a footprint approximately in the shape of an isosceles right triangle, with the hypotenuse of this triangle parallel to the shore of the Upper Harbor Canal to the northeast, while the legs are to the west and south. The design consists of a comparatively large, four- to five-storey pedestal, on top of which the next six to seven floors are more and more recessed to form the base of a slender, approximately sixty-storey tower figure. The top eight floors of the tower once again take up the theme of flowing gradation, gradually dodging northeast. Due to the complex geometry of the structure, depending on the place of observation, different urban development effects will result.  History  The Senate first presented the project in March 2017 at the MIPIM . According to estimates, the construction costs amount to 700 million euros.  Reception  The project receives both support and opposition from the public and political representatives. While the ruling SPD and the opposition parties CDU and FDP welcomed these plans, while the Greens expressed skepticism as coalition partner of the SPD. Critics pointed out that the renovation and development of existing buildings such as the Heinrich Hertz Tower (Hamburg‚Äôs TV tower) and the Bismarck monument should take precedence over new prestige projects. The Senate responded to this criticism with the announcement of a transparent construction project and in particular a purely private financing of the project. Further criticism refers to the more fundamental urban development question as to whether a skyscraper of the planned construction volume fits in with Hamburg‚Äôs building tradition. There are also concerns that the project ‚Äì similar to other major local and national projects, such as the Elbphilharmonie, which opened about a year before the presentation of the draft ‚Äì could, depending on the contractual details, put another huge financial burden on the city.Oliver Schirg: Zu hoch?

Gutstein's work focuses on links between business, the media, and politics. Themes Gutstein explores the relationship between business, corporations and politics. In his 2009 book entitled Not a conspiracy theory : how business propaganda hijacks democracy, Gutstein traced the rise of \\"prolonged\\" corporate \\"propaganda campaigns\\" in the United States that influence public opinion on social and political issues. Catalogue key 6961325 In Harperism, Gutstein writes that Canadian think tanks such as the Fraser Institute established in 1974, the C.D. Howe and the 1990s \\"cohort of right wing think-tanks across Canada, such as Atlantic Institute for Market Studies (AIMS), the Montreal Economic Institute and Frontier Centre for Public Policy, have increasingly harnessed the media. In 2006 Peter Munk‚Äôs Aurea foundation funded neoliberal think tanks. In 2009 the School of Public Policy, University of Calgary functioned as \\"a neoliberal think tank\\" at the university. Gutstein cites as examples media coverage of medicare, climate change, and Canada's economic integration with the United States. Gutstein points out that think tanks succeeded in establishing consensus on the benefits of \\"small government\\", \\"perpetual war\\", and a \\"free market and the disadvantages of \\"tax increases to fund social programs\\" which has \\"severely\\" limited \\"political discourse\\". In his chapter entitled \\"Convince Canadians of the importance of economic freedom,\\" Gutstein described how neo-liberals and libertarians perceive Canada's Supply management as an obstacle to economic freedom and how think tanks and the media have attacked Canada's supply management. Under Stephen Harper, neo-liberal think tanks and through them, the media, called for the elimination of supply management with its alleged market distorting mechanisms. The Fraser Institute's use of the \\"egg marketing cartel\\" in a 1981 report by American economist Thomas Borcherding, marked the beginning of an aggressive campaign to end supply management in the ensuing decades. Gutstein sharply challenged journalist and editor Neil Reynolds (1940 - 2013), a libertarian, who criticized supply management in his call for economic freedom in thirteen Globe and Mail columns from c. 1997 through 2012, for an inaccurate portrayal of New Zealand's dairy industry. Reviews In his review published in the Canadian Journal of Communication, Brian Gorman described how Gutstein calls for \\"a new role for government ‚Ä¶ one that doesn‚Äôt treat everything as an offshoot of the economy, but reincorporates social and political rights into its mandate while addressing the dominance of the market in social and political life.\\" Canadian columnist and editor Andrew Coyne ridiculed Gutstein's premise that Harper and Coyne himself as a Donner Canadian Foundation board member, were part of a \\"vast network of free-market policy shops...The dullest commonplaces of mainstream economics are here transformed into a strange and threatening \\"neo-liberal\\" conspiracy, while pimply economists in threadbare offices are endowed with an occult power they never knew they possessed.\\" References 2014 non-fiction books Books about politicians Canadian political books ","title":"Harperism (book)"},{"id":"58495527","text":"Dr. Sai Hsai Kyauk Sam ( , born 22 October 1951) is a Burmese politician who currently serves as a House of Nationalities member of parliament for Shan State ‚Ññ 6 constituency.
