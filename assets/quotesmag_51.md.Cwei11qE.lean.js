Century Hutchinson) The Minister and the Massacres (1986) is a history written by Nikolai Tolstoy about the 1945 repatriations of Croatian soldiers and civilians and Cossacks, who had crossed into Austria seeking refuge from the Red Army and Partisans who had taken control in Yugoslavia. He criticized the British repatriation of collaborationist troops to Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav government, attributing the decisions to Harold Macmillan, then UK minister of the Mediterranean, and Lord Aldington. Tolstoy is among historians who say numerous massacres of such soldiers took place after their repatriation. His conclusions about leading British officials were criticized in turn. In this history, Tolstoy continued his exploration of late world war history. His earlier books were Victims of Yalta (1977) and Stalin's Secret War (1981). Lord Aldington later filed a libel lawsuit against Tolstoy and a man he had written for. He refused to settle and was found guilty of libel at trial, where he was sentenced to pay major damages. Contents Tolstoy accused Harold Macmillan, then \\"minister resident\\" in the Mediterranean and future prime minister of the United Kingdom, of persuading British General Alexander to ignore a telegram of the Foreign Office that would have restricted repatriation of certain refugees. It recommended against repatriating individuals who were not Soviet citizens by British law. Application of this would have divided the Cossacks into √©migr√©s and those from the Soviet Union, the former, not subject to repatriation. Tolstoy also criticised Lord Aldington, who he claimed gave a key order on 21 May 1945 that made all of the Cossacks subject to repatriation. In referencing the documents of that time, Tolstoy quoted a General Alexander telegram, sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, in which Alexander mentioned \\"25,000 German and Croat units\\". In a second telegram sent to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Alexander asked for guidelines regarding the final disposition of ‚Äú50,000 Cossacks including 11,000 women, children and old men; present estimate of total 35,000 Chetniks ‚Äì 11,000 of them already evacuated to Italy ‚Äì and 25,000 German and Croat units.‚Äù The telegram said that in each of above cases, ‚Äúreturning them to their country of origin immediately might be fatal to their health.‚ÄùTolstoy, 1986, pp. 124-25 Tolstoy \\"reconstructed what happened when, on May 31, the commandant of the military camp at Viktring, 'Lieutenant Ames', reported that he had received orders for 2,700 of the civilian refugees in Major Barre's camp to be taken to Rosenbach and Bleiburg the following day, to be handed over to Tito's partisans.\\" Reception British reviewers of Tolstoy's history noted what they thought were weaknesses in his book, influenced by his having been among the victims of losses in the Soviet Union following the Russian Revolution. They suggested that he over-identified with the victims of repatriation, whose numbers are disputed. Alistair Horne wrote: > Trying to weave a way through the tangled cobweb of truths, half-truths, and > downright inaccuracies woven by Tolstoy proved to be one of the longest and > most arduous tasks I have ever undertaken as a writer. > [...] his writing came increasingly to reveal a fanatical obsessiveness that > was more Slav than Anglo-Saxon. Appalled by the injustice inflicted upon his > fellow White Russians, and dedicated to the cause of seeing that it should > be requited on a public platform, Tolstoy progressively persuaded himself > that the repatriations had flowed from an evil conspiracy. > [...] in it [The Minister and the Massacres] Tolstoy jeopardized what claim > he had to be a serious and objective historian by his tendency to shape the > facts around conclusions he had already formed. Stevan K. Pavlowitch wrote: After reading the book, Brigadier General Anthony Cowgill held his own independent, unofficial inquiry into the events. Tolstoy at first co-operated with the inquiry, sharing documents and contact details for surviving witnesses. Cowgill concluded, as outlined in an initial report in September 1988 and a final report in October 1990, that the repatriations were in line with UK policy. He said there had been no conspiracy and Macmillan's role was minimal. One of Cowgill's inquiry team was Christopher Booker, who had initially supported Tolstoy.Ian Mitchell, \\"The Cost of a Reputation\\", Topical Books, 1997, pp. 145-146, Booker wrote in more detail in A Looking Glass Tragedy. The Controversy over the Repatriations from Austria in 1945,Booker, 1997, p. 85 arguing in relation to Bleiburg that \\"many 'massacres' described in lurid detail never took place\\". He said that Tolstoy had distorted the account contrary to the facts, and that there are no traces in the archives of any massacre ever committed in or around Bleiburg or its surroundings (only nine documents in the British Army archives relate to Bleiburg in May 1945). Booker notes Tolstoy's reliance on three eyewitnesses, who were describing events 40 years before and who were very partial.Booker, 1997, Chapter 12. 2. \\"Bleiburg: The Massacre That Never Was\\", p. 188. Almost simultaneously, author Ian Mitchell wrote in The Cost of a Reputation (1997) (about the ensuing libel case) that the archives had been weeded of most of the incriminating documents,Ian Mitchell, \\"The Cost of a Reputation\\", Topical Books, 1997, p. 77-78. He noted that related documents had survived in other archives, including those of the United States, or the Foreign Office. but he criticised Tolstoy for concluding his book with the allegation that Macmillan was an ally of the Soviet Union's NKVD. Laurence Rees wrote a book about World War II. In response to Booker, he said that historians should treat every source they use skeptically, and that applies to written sources as much as eye-witness accounts.Musgrove (ed.) 2009, p. 70 As an example, he noted the following account. > Nigel Nicolson, a British officer with 3 Battalion, Welsh Guards, who took > part in the infamous forced repatriations from Austria in the summer of > 1945, said to me that he had deliberately falsified the historical record at > the time, writing that the Yugoslavian deportees had been offered ‚Äòlight > refreshments‚Äô by their Tito Communist guards. He‚Äôd done this because he had > been ordered not to tell the truth in his military report ‚Äì that the > deportees were being appallingly treated ‚Äì and so had written something that > he thought was so ludicrous ‚Äì how could the deportees be given ‚Äòlight > refreshments? ‚Äì that future historians would know he was being ironic. But, > before Mr Nicolson admitted what he‚Äôd done, some historians had taken his > written report at face value and used it to try and ‚Äòprove‚Äô that the > surviving deportees who now spoke of how badly they had been treated were > lying. If Nigel Nicolson hadn‚Äôt told the truth years later then that > inaccurate report would still be in the written archives and the suffering > of the deportees still disputed. So my advice is to be as careful of the > accuracy of written archives as you are careful of the accuracy of people. Libel case Tolstoy had been in contact with a property developer, Nigel Watts, who had a dispute with Lord Aldington over an unpaid insurance claim (Aldington was chairman of Sun Alliance). In his dispute with Aldington, Watts sought to attack his character by drawing together the accusations made in The Minister and the Massacres. Tolstoy wrote a 2,000-word text for him, which Watts published as a pamphlet entitled \\"War Crimes and the Wardenship of Winchester College\\", which he distributed to anyone he thought might have heard of Aldington.Ian Mitchell, The Cost of a Reputation, Topical Books, 1997, pp. 151-52. In 1989, Lord Aldington, a former post-war Chairman of the Conservative Party, and subsequently Chairman of Sun Alliance, commenced a libel action against Watts. Although Tolstoy was not the initial target of the action, he joined Watts as defendant. Aldington also sued Century Hutchinson as publishers of The Minister and the Massacres. In June 1989, before the pamphlet case came to trial, Century Hutchinson settled the case by paying ¬£30,000 damages\\"¬£30,000 for Aldington libel\\", The Times, 20 December 1989, p. 5. and agreeing not to republish Tolstoy's book.\\"Aldington gets ¬£30,000 over Tolstoy book\\", The Guardian, 20 December 1989, p. 4. Watts withdrew and settled. Tolstoy continued to trial, lost, and was ordered to pay ¬£2 million (¬£1.5 million in damages and ¬£0.5 million in costs). Tolstoy declared himself bankrupt and made no payments, 'while continuing to live in his big house, and send his children to expensive schools.' Tolstoy sought to appeal on the basis of new evidence, which he claimed proved Aldington had perjured himself over the date of his departure from Austria in May 1945. This was ruled inadmissible at a hearing in the High Courts of Justice, from which the press and public were barred, and his application for an appeal was rejected.The Guardian, 28 May 1992, p. 19, and 8 June 1992, p. 4 In July 1995, the European Court of Human Rights concluded unanimously that the British Government had violated Tolstoy's rights in respect of Article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights, although this referred strictly to the amount of the damages awarded against him and did not overturn the guilty verdict of his libel action. The Times commented in a leading article: > In its judgment yesterday in the case of Count Nikolai Tolstoy, the European > Court of Human Rights ruled against Britain in important respects, finding > that the award of ¬£1.5 million levelled against the Count by a jury in 1989 > amounted to a violation of his freedom of expression. Parliament will find > the implications of this decision difficult to ignore. The Sunday Times reported in 1996 that documents obtained after these events from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) by Tolstoy's backers suggested that under Government instructions, files that could have had a bearing on the defence case might have been withdrawn from the Public Record Office and retained by the MoD and Foreign Office throughout the run-up to and during the libel trial.The Sunday Times, 7 April 1996. Tolstoy refused to pay anything in libel damages to Lord Aldington while the latter was alive. On 9 December 2000, two days after Aldington's death, Tolstoy paid ¬£57,000 to the man's estate. In Lord Aldington's obituary, Andrew Roth said that Tolstoy's criticism of Aldington was misdirected and should have been directed at Macmillan and Winston Churchill.

It is located in the village of Blarney, County Cork, Ireland. Ownership Spinning machine in use at the Mill = Mahony Brothers = Martin Mahony & Bros Ltd, owned by the brothers Martin and Noel, began building a mill in Blarney, County Cork in 1823. It was completed the following year. A decade later the mills employed 120 people, and by the middle of the 19th century its numbers had swelled to over 200. Water was the power source for the mill and the Mahonys built a large dam on the Martin river (near Waterloo), forming a mill pond. The resulting pressure drove the mill-wheel at Blarney, via the millstream and millrace. While textiles was a booming industry for Ireland in the 19th century, Blarney Woollen Mills carved out a niche in tweeds, woolen worsted cloths, knitting wools and hosiery. A fire at Christmas in 1869 saw the destruction of the mill. It was re-built the following year and still stands to this day.

Syrian public-owned television reported that it was a suicide attack while the opposition claims it was a remotely detonated bomb. Bombing The attack, during a meeting of ministers and a number of heads of security agencies, resulted in the death of the Syrian Defense Minister General Dawoud Rajiha. Also killed were Assef Shawkat, president Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law and deputy defense minister, the assistant to the vice president General Hasan Turkmani, and Hafez Makhlouf, head of investigations at the Syrian Intelligence Agency. However, Hafez Makhlouf was also reported to be wounded. The country's intelligence and national security chief Hisham Ikhtiyar was seriously wounded. There were conflicting reports on the fate of the Interior minister Mohammad al-Shaar with initial accounts stating that he had also been killed, but later state TV reported that he survived although wounded. Additional reports stated that he was in stable condition. Al-Shaar was reported dead later, according to Al Jazeera. Mohammed Saeed Bekheitan, the national secretary of the Ba'ath Party, was also wounded in the bombing. Press TV provided a conflicting report, indicating that Hisham Ikhityar had died in the bombing and that Mohammad al-Shaar had been wounded.

Another report said that the bomb was hidden in the briefcase of Syrian Interior Minister Mohammad al-Shaar, who was injured in the blast.How Assad Staged Al Qaeda Bombings The Daily Beast The Salafist Liwa al-Islam (\\"Brigade of Islam\\") and the Free Syrian Army both claimed responsibility for the bombing. Louay Almokdad, the Free Syrian Army's logistical coordinator, claimed that the attack was perpetrated by a group of Free Syrian Army members in coordination with drivers and bodyguards working for Assad's high-ranking officials. It was further stated that the two explosive devices, one made of 25 pounds of TNT, and the other a smaller C-4 plastic-explosive device, had been put in the room days before the meeting by a person working for Hisham Ikhtiyar. According to a 2016 Daily Beast article, former Syrian general Mohamad Khalouf claimed Iran and Assad were actually responsible for the bombing. Khalouf said that the officials killed were more moderate members of the regime whom Iran wanted removed. Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat, also blamed Iran. The same Daily Beast article also quoted Syrian intelligence sources that said Assad believed the dead officials were planning a coup against him, and that all investigations into the bombing were blocked. Former ambassador Robert Stephen Ford said of the bombing, \\"I don't think we know how it was done.\\"  Reaction  = Domestic = Although there were no statements from President Assad himself, Syrian TV said after the attack that a decree from him named Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij, who used to be the army chief of staff, as the new defense minister. Syrian state television said foreign-backed terrorists had carried out the attack. The country's armed forces said in a statement that Syria was \\"determined to confront all forms of terrorism and chop off any hand that harms national security\\".

It is situated on the Bidar-Udgir Road, 15 km from Bidar, Karnataka, India. Said temple is located within the Vijayanagara [\\"city of victory\\"] empire; which is now South India.Sinopoli, C. M. (2000). FROM THE LION THRONE: POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA EMPIRE. Journal Of The Economic & Social History Of The Orient, 43(3), 364. Some of the languages spoken during this time were Kannada, Telugu, and Tamil.Sinopoli, C. M. (2000). FROM THE LION THRONE: POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA EMPIRE. Journal Of The Economic & Social History Of The Orient, 43(3), 364.  History  The temple's origin is connected with the demon Mallasur (Malla) (in Kannada asur means demons) and his younger brother Manikasur (Mani), who gained the boon of invincibility from Brahma, creating chaos on the earth and harassing the sages. When the seven sages approached Shiva for protection after Indra and Vishnu confessed their incapability, Shiva assumed the form (or Avatar) of Martanda Bhairava, as the Mahatmya calls Mallanna (Khandoba), riding the Nandi bull, leading an army of the gods. Martanda Bhairava is described as shining like the golden sun, covered in turmeric and appearing with three-eyes and a crescent moon on his forehead. The demon army was slaughtered by the gods and Khandoba killed Malla and Mani. While dying, Malla offered his white horse to Khandoba as an act of repentance and asked for a favor‚Äîthat he be present in every shrine of Khandoba. Thus, this temple is called Sri Shiva Mailari Mallanna (Khandoba) Temple. The Mailar Mallanna Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Khandoba (also known as Mailar Mallanna and a form of the god Shiva, in Mailar or Khanapur village). It is situated on the Bidar-Udgir Road, 15 km from Bidar, Karnataka, India. The main day of worship is believed to be Sunday. Near the temple, trading takes place. They trade animals such as goats, sheep and cows. Devotees visit this temple to seek fulfillment of salvation, wealth, knowledge, purchase of vehicles and relief of diseases. This temple attracts millions of tourists and is very beautiful to view.  Devotees  Vijayanagara's kings adopted deities and ritual practices and their sacred images were transported from distant areas to the capital. As new temples were constructed new sculptures were carved with one of them being Mailar. Mailar had a long history in South India but had primarily been a regional God, worshipped by rural communities and pastorals. Sacred text suggest that this fierce protester deity began to be elevated from a regional folk deity, mainly associated with warriors, to a more widespread deity eventually linked to Vijayanagara. One of these texts depicts Mailar as \\"king on earth\\" worshipped by many Muslims. When deities were elevated in status it meant they were farce gods with warrior attributes and protectors; which linked them to the militaristic qualities of this city. Famous in the North Karnataka area, the temple attracts millions of devotees from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh annually. The temple's main priest belongs to the Kurubas community. On Sunday, the principle worship day, the trading of goats, sheep, cows and other animals takes place nearby. Devotees visit this temple to seek fulfillment of salvation, wealth, health, vehicles and knowledge.  Rituals  Homa, or a fire offering, is common practice before performing Rudrabhishek. Some of the offerings include grains and seeds along with other materials. The holy bath of the Shivling is done after the fire offering. This is one of the most strengthening forms of worship. This cleanses, brings happiness, wealth, peace, and success to devotees. Devotees are offered a drink after the holy bath. The devotees journey to the temple is the individual's separation from his or her old identity or position in society. The actual act of washing the Shivling is the liminal state in the process. The final stage in the passage is the journey the devotee takes on while on his way home to enter society with a new identity. It is strongly believed that performing Redrabhishek will help an individual's success in life. Hinduism believes that reality or truth cannot be encapsulated in a creedal form, but instead needs to be sought out from various sources, the holly bath being one of them. These rites of passage stages are derived from Van Gennep's. He states that every rite of passage includes three stages; the first being separation from your old identity and normal time, the second being the transition or liminal stage (as Victor Turner called it), and third the is the reintegration stage you have taken on your new identity and entered back into societies normal sense of time.  Vijayanagara architecture  Architectural temples were an important part of Vijayanagara society. Sacred temples incorporated a range of regional architectural traditions that reflected those of Southern Deccan (see also Deccan Architecture) where the capital was located; this was often called a \\"unitary style\\" Sinopoli, C. M. (2000). FROM THE LION THRONE: POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA EMPIRE. Journal Of The Economic & Social History Of The Orient, 43(3), 364. However, temples became increasingly ornate over time, including moldings, bricks and walled complexes built within gopuras or massive towered gates.  Mailar Mallanna Temple in relation to Grace Harris's Concepts of Individual Self and Person  Individual is defined as stuff, matter and is physically touchable (Harris 1989). An example of Individual when it comes to the Temple is Khandoba. Khandoba could be seen as an individual because it was he the individual who killed Malla and Mani. Self is established by experience as the key concept along with memory and continuity (Harris 1989). Malla is an example of self, because before he passes he offers his white horse to Khandoba. Malla looked back at his experience and what he had done, such as causing chaos. Looking back upon his negative actions made him to decide to offer Khandoba his white horse. This act of offering his white horse was a sign of repentance. Malla offered his white horse in order for his spirit to be remembered and welcomed in the temple. Person is defined as one's relationship to others (Harris 1989). An example of self would be Shiva's part in the representation of the temple because he is the god people reach to in order to feel protected. To the people, Shiva represents the gods and is looked up upon to protect and keep the evil away. There are concepts which combine two of Harris's ideas. In my opinion, Shiva as the person could also be combined with Shiva as a self because Shiva is a spiritual experience/memory, but he can also be the a person because of the influential role he plays in people's relationship to him. He has a relationship to the people as their protector. Multiple factors of this legend indicate that there is the possibility that all of the concepts Individual, Self, and Person can be applied to at least most of the concepts behind the temple.Harris, Grace Gredys. 1989. \\"Concepts of Individual, Self, and Person in Description and Analysis.\\" American Anthropologist 91(3):599-612.  Mailar Mallanna Temple in relation to Wallerstein's model and adaptive strategies There is no known exact date to know when the temple was built and worshiping began. However, after conducting research about the other temples in the surrounding area, they were built around the late Middle Ages (1350- 1500) (Mudde, 2016). During the Middle Ages, India was at trading with countries, because of their access to the sea on three sides of their country. They would export textiles and iron to the big civilizations of that era, China and Egypt (Goitein & Friednman, 2008). This indicates according to the Wallerstein's model, that India during the Middle Ages was considered to be in the periphery (Halsall, 1997). The periphery is when an area transports raw materials to the core, the core in this situation is China and Egypt (Halsall, 1997). They were also at this time in between rulers because of the constant switch of empires and fighting that was continuing in all regions (knowindia.gov). This is another example of how India could be considered to be in the periphery, because they have no strong central government. At this time period, agriculture started to become more popular, especially the production of rice, wheat and millet (eagri.org). Many other crops were also being brought over into this society because of the vast amount of trading that was occurring (eagri.org). Irrigation systems began to be introduced in India, which helped with growth of maturation of building material (eagri.org). This water technology could have helped with the start of building the Mailar Mallanna Temple. India during the late Middle Ages was using the adaptive strategy of cultivation, specifically agriculture. So, they are following the substance pattern because they were progressing in the adaptive strategies. Chronology of agricultural technology development in India.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Krasnogorodsk Urban Settlement, the only urban settlement in the district. Population: History Krasnogorodsk was founded in 1464 as Krasny Gorodets and was a fortress protecting Pskov from the southwest - one of the directions the Livonian Order was likely to advance from. In the beginning of the 15th century, together with Pskov, it was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1581, Krasny Gorodets was conquered by the Polish Army and burned down. In 1607, it was again conquered by Lithuanians. In 1634 a peace between Russia and Poland was concluded, and the Krasny Gorodets was transferred to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. It was returned to Russia under one of the provisions of the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667. By the end of the 19th century, the name of the settlement was Krasnogorodskoye and it was a part of Opochetsky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Krasnogorodsky District was established, with the administrative center in Krasnogorodskoye. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 1, 1932 the district was abolished and split between Pushkinsky, Ostrovsky, and Opochetsky Districts. On March 5, 1935 the district was re-established on the areas belonging to Pushkinsky and Opochetsky Districts. Between May 11, 1935 and February 5, 1941, Krasnogorodsky District was a part of Opochka Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. Between 1941 and 1944, the district was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, the oblast was abolished, and Krasnogorodsky District was transferred into Pskov Oblast. On February 1, 1963, the district was abolished and merged into Opochetsky District; on December 30, 1966, it was re-established. On April 26, 1967, Krasnogorodskoye was granted urban-type settlement status, and on January 26, 1995, it was renamed Krasnogorodsk.

However, on December 8 such pieces arrived and an intense bombardment of Wolmar was executed which continued for ten days. Finally on December 18, when the cannons had breached two entrances in the walls, the Polish troops managed to storm the defenses and entered the city. The Swedish garrison withdrew to the town's castle where they defended themselves and held back the Poles for a while. Later, when the situation became particularly disadvantageous, they asked for conditions of surrender.

COL2A1 upregulation in Osteoarthritis miR-675 has been found to be upregulated in osteoarthritic cartilage, alongside H19. Indeed, there is co-regulation of these two RNAs. The COL2A1 gene associated with osteoarthritis through altered expression levels compared with in normal tissue is upregulated by miR-675 overexpression. It has been proposed that miR-675 may modulate collagen type II levels via an unknown target molecule, and there is potential for a diagnostic metabolic balance indicator in osteoarthritis through this microRNA.

MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms. miR-708 is located on chromosome 11q14.1 and is endcoded in intron 1 of the ODZ4 gene. It is most highly expressed in the brain and eyes, and has a supposed role in endoplasmic reticular stress of the eye. Ewing's Sarcoma miR-708 has been implicated in the bone-specific Ewing's sarcoma. Upregulation of the DNA repair protein EYA3 in this tumour is mediated by the fusion protein transcription factor EWS/FLI1, which in turn is via repression of miR-708. miR-708 targets the 3'UTR of EYA3, rather than binding directly to its promoter region. High levels of EYA3 in Ewing's sarcoma are accordingly correlated with low levels of miR-708. miR-708 and Lung Cancer High miR-708 expression levels are observed in lung cancers due to their oncogenic role in lung cancer tumour growth and progression. miR-708 overexpression results in increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and has therefore been associated with a decreased survival rate in lung epithelial cancers. It directly downregulates the transmembrane protein 88 (TMEM88), a negative regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway.

It is the 8th named storm, the 3rd severe tropical storm, and overall, the 13th tropical cyclone to be monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during 2012. Khanun was also the first tropical storm to make a landfall over Korea in 2012. Khanun means \\"jack fruit\\" in Thai. Meteorological history Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Khanun over Korea, on July 19, as it becomes Extratropical. =South Korea= Before Khanun made landfall over Korea, two international flights linking Incheon to Manila were canceled on July 18 according to Incheon International Airport. From Wednesday, some 90 flights scheduled for Jeju and the southern city of Pohang, as well as 115 ferry trips for the southern islands were canceled, according to transportation officials. As Khanun made its way to the central region along the west coast from Korea's southern resort island of Jeju, heavy rains and gales caused parts of a house to collapse in North Gyeongsang Province, killing an 83-year-old elderly woman. Losses in South Jeolla Province were calculated at ‚Ç©180 million (US$158,000). The storm had deposited of rain in Suncheon, in Jeju and in Seoul as of 6 a.m., the weather office said. To control the water level, North Korea has been discharging water from its Hwangang Dam, located near the border with the South, since Wednesday noon, prompting South Korean campers to evacuate. No damages from the water release have been reported so far. =North Korea= In North Korea, state-run media reported that at least seven people were killed in Kangwon province, with an eighth fatality reported elsewhere. It said the storm caused significant damage, destroying 650 dwelling houses, 30 public buildings, railways, roads, bridges, and various systems. The flooding also inundated nearly 3,870 homes, leaving more than 16,250 people homeless. On 29 July the North Korean government dramatically raised the death toll in the country to 88, with an additional 134 injured. The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan Province. At least 63,000 were made homeless by the flooding, while more than 30,000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country. Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm. On 31 July United Nations staff visited flood-ravaged areas in hard-hit South Pyongan and Kangwon provinces. Heavy rain continued along the western edge of the country, including the capital Pyongyang. North Korea's official media reported that premier Choe Yong Rim visited flooded towns and discussed ways to help recovery efforts. Aftermath Torrential rains hit North Korea again on 29 and 30 July, with approximately 442 millimeters (17.4 inches) of rain recorded in Pakchon County of North Phyongan Province during a 24#8209;hour period from 6 a.m. local time 29 July. The rains worsened the flood situation caused by Khanun, destroying railways, roads, bridges and 'many' dwelling houses. The North Korean government requested assistance from resident United Nations agencies, the Red Cross, and European Union Program Support Units. It also supported two inter-agency assessment missions in South Pyongan and Kangwon provinces on 31 July. On 4 August, government sources announced the death toll from both Khanun and the torrential rains in late July had risen to 169, with around 400 others missing. At least 8,600 houses were destroyed and 44,000 houses were flooded, leaving more than 212,200 people homeless.

Founded in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1985, they premiered some 500 works. They were awarded the Schneider-Schott Music Prize in 1995 and the Rheingau Musikpreis in 1997.  Career  The ensemble was founded in 1985 and is based in Freiburg. The repertoire is focused on the music of the 20th and 21st century while covering the spectrum from classical modernism and the Darmstadt School to contemporary music, but occasionally also includes works composed before 1700, interpreted from a contemporary perspective. The ensemble premiered some 500 works, including compositions by H√®ctor Parra, Brice Pauset, G√©rard Pesson and Wolfgang Rihm. The ensemble plays concerts, especially a concert series in Freiburg. In addition, they participate in film, radio and theater projects, provide courses for instrumentalists and composers in Freiburg and at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse, and hold open rehearsals. Together with the Freiburger Barockorchester, the ensemble recherche has organised the annual Ensemble- Akademie Freiburg for ensemble playing. Current members of the ensemble are Melise Mellinger (violin), Paul Beckett (viola), √Ösa √Ökerberg (cello), Martin Fahlenbock (flute), Jaime Gonzalez (oboe), Shizuyo Oka (clarinet), Christian Dierstein (percussion), Klaus Steffes-Holl√§nder and Jean-Pierre Collot (piano). Starting in 1999, the ensemble recherche began commissioning an ongoing series of short In Nomine compositions for the festival Wittener Tage f√ºr neue Kammermusik, titled the Witten In Nomine Broken Consort Book.

The canvas measures . It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Mus√©e du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed. Caillebotte's originality lay in his attempt to combine the careful drawing, modeling and exact tonal values encouraged by the Acad√©mie with vivid colors, bold perspectives, keen sense of natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement. Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment‚Äînow believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation. Caillebotte's interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality, however it was part of a larger trend, not necessarily limited to homosexual artists, that was first introduced by Courbet in a painting of two wrestlers (Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)). This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban working class. It reintroduces the subject of the male nude in the painting, but in a strikingly updated form. Instead of the heroes of antiquity, here are the heroes of modern life‚Äîsinewy and strong‚Äîin stooped poses that would appear demeaning if they did not convey a sense of masculine strength and honest labor. There is a motif of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers. The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, Edgar Degas. 1876 version of the same subject by Caillebotte Despite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a \\"vulgar subject matter\\". He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a second, different version of Raboteurs from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme √† sa fen√™tre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as \\"vulgar\\". The painting divided opinion in Parisian art circles. Among the detractors, Emile Porchoron, a critic of Impressionism, damned Caillebotte with faint praise: \\"the least bad of the exhibition. One of the missions Impressionism seems to have set for itself is to torture perspective: you see here what results can be obtained.\\" √âmile Zola praised the technical execution, but then called it \\"an anti-artistic painting, painting as neat as glass, bourgeois painting, because of the exactitude of the copying.\\" Louis √ânault was not troubled by the depiction (\\"The subject matter is certainly vulgar, but we can understand how it might tempt a painter\\") but did find fault with the image's fidelity to the scene: \\"I only regret that the artist did not choose his types better... The arms of the planers are too thin, and their chests too narrow... may your nude be handsome or don't get involved with it!\\" The painting received praise from many critics, though. Regarding the Salon rejection, poet and critic √âmile Bl√©mont called the decision \\"[a] very bad mark for the official jurors\\". Maurice Chaumelin compared Caillebotte favorably to his contemporaries, writing that the work showed that he was \\"a realist just as raw, but much more witty, than Courbet, just as violent, but altogether more precise, than Manet.\\" Philippe Burty made comparisons to an even earlier generation of artists: \\"His pictures are original in their composition, but, more than that, so energetic as to drawing that they resemble the early Florentines.\\"  Cultural depictions  * Les Raboteurs, choreography by Angelin Preljocaj, music by Thierry Lancino, film by Cyril Collard (co-production with Mus√©e d'Orsay, La Sept, Opus 10-19; 1988).iDoc Preljocaj Notes References  * Paintings by Gustave Caillebotte 1875 paintings Paintings of the Mus√©e d'Orsay ","title":"Les raboteurs de parquet"},{"id":"36471252","text":"Vahedi is a surname.

Most bodies were made by Viberti, with the last 23 by Pistoiesi. A total of 183 were built. The V.81 came in two lengths, the Lancia PV81 powered version (with ) at long and the Lancia V10 powered version long. The V10 originally produced and from 1957 . The weight of a Lancia Esatau V.81 is 9,3 tonnes. The bus had 18 seats and space for an additional 30 standing passengers.

Furthermore, combination with either miR-16 or miR-92a allows extremely accurate distinction between TBI patients and healthy controls. miR-765 and pheochromocytomas Increased miR-765 expression is observed in Von Hippel-Lindau disease compared with the sporadic benign forms of pheochromocytomas. It has been linked to neuronal plasticity through the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 (NTRK3) gene. A NTRK3 3'UTR variant, ss102661458, is located in a functional target site of miR-765 and is able to significantly affect miRNA-mediated NTRK3 regulation. Through this there is restoration of the altered gene expression by miR-765. NTRK3 is underexpressed with high or overexpressed levels of miR-765, thus pointing towards a possible involvement of this relationship in pheochromocytoma pathogenesis.

MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms. ROMK Channels and Caveolin-1 Suppression miR-802 expression in the kidney is stimulated by a high potassium intake, along with caveolin-1 expression, one of the many miR-802 protein targets. Surface expression of Renal Outer Medullary Potassium (ROMK) channels has been found to be enhanced in the plasma membrane of the distal nephron of the kidney by miR-802 expression. Caveolin-1 conversely inhibits ROMK channel activity, and expression of the two shows a clear inverse relationship. Co-expression of miR-802 with caveolin-1 blocks miR-802's upregulatory effects on ROMK channels. miR-802 thus functions to mediate the stimulatory effect of a high potassium diet on ROMK activity through suppression of caveolin-1 expression, this leading to an increased surface expression of ROMK channels. Human Chromosome 21 Human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) has been found to harbour over 400 different genes, with miR-802 among these. Along with miRNAs-99a, -125b-2, -155 and let-7c, miR-802 is overexpressed in brain and heart specimens of Down syndrome individuals, resulting in suppression of specific target proteins. This suppression in turn contributes towards the common phenotypic alterations observed in Down syndrome patients.

Overproduction of SOD-1 increases oxidative damage and through this results in enhanced apoptosis and cell death.

Sexual dimorphisms in the brain are altered and there is female-like expression of key neurodevelopment genes. The common target gene for miR-873, Œ≤-glycan, has increased expression. It is thought that miR-873, along with other miRNAs, may play a role in organisation of the sexually dimorphic brain due to a marked response to organisational testosterone.

In 2019 it merged with the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) to form UKHospitality. The association promotes the interests of the hospitality industry to the Government Ministers, MPs, MSPs, Welsh Assembly Members, MEPs, the EU Commission, the City and the Media. The association operates by membership-based system.  History  Frank Bourne-Newton (1850-1940), co-founder of the BHA BHA traces its origins back to 1885 when James Allen, of the Queen‚Äôs Hotel in Leeds, tried to establish the first association for supporting and representing the hotel industry in England. In 1891/2, the Caterer magazine took the similar attempt. However, those tries remained unsuccessful due to lack of support and interest. In 1906, one of the main promises of the Liberal Party at the elections was to reduce drunkenness primarily by abolishing one-third of the liquor licenses in the UK. Moreover, it was proposed that the profits lost by the one-third of the licensees whose businesses were closed down would be recovered as a compensation levy from the remained two-thirds who survived. When the Liberal Party won the election with majority of 300 seats in the House of Commons, the industry faced a major disaster. Frank Bourne-Newton, the editor, publisher and proprietor of Caterer, Hotelkeeper and Refreshment Contractors‚Äô Gazette (now Caterer and Hotelkeeper), joined together with Dudley James, manager of Morley's Hotel in Trafalgar Square (replaced by South Africa House) to form a national association which would lobby the hospitality industry‚Äôs interests and defend it against attacks on existing conditions. As a result, they established National Hotel-Keepers Association in 1907, which by the end of the year was granted its certificate by the government as Incorporated Hotel-Keepers Association (IHKA). Out of thirty-six founder members, five hotels are still members of the BHA; nine are still in business (though, not always as hotels); and the remaining twenty-two have been demolished, redeveloped or destroyed during the World War II. Earl of Bessborough, president of the IAHK from 1910-1920 The first task to undertake for the newly formed organisation was to make the Government reconsider its plans regarding the new Licensing Act. IHKA lobbied the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Herbert Asquitch, and achieved some success as the Government agreed to reduce the compensation levy for hotels to one-third that applied to the public houses. The bill was, however, vetoed by the House of Lords but eventually re-introduced years later when the upper house could no longer block it due to its reformation by The Parliament Act 1911. From its founding to 1910, IHKA had a number of other achievements. The association fought licensing duties and tried to lobby a reduced insurance premium for members affected by the Employers‚Äô Liability Act. It ensured that the Shops Act 1911 did not affect hotels; which would have reduced the working hours to no more than twelve a day, five days a week and fourteen hours on Saturdays. Some years later, the founders realised that the IHKA could not run any longer because it did not have sufficient funds to fight long battles with the Government. In 1910, IHKA merged with Incorporated Association of Hotels and Restaurants (IAHR), recently formed by major hoteliers, and adopted its name. During the First World War, hotels, along with many others, were affected by the food shortage. The IAHR was the first to recommend rationing to the Government. It also raised concerns regarding enormous number of forms had to be filled by the hotels to account for the food that they used. By the end of the World War I, the IAHR formed a parliamentary committee and the Government recognised it as the negotiating body for the industry. Once the war was over, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Austen Chamberlain, decided to introduce a new tax for luxury goods to raise money and included hotels into such category. The IAHR managed to persuade Sir Austen to drop this plan at the Committee stage. In the mid-1920s, IAHR introduced its regional divisions to provide all members with more control of the specific efforts needed in their areas. In 1926, association decided to change its name again and became the Hotel & Restaurant Association of Great Britain (HRA). In 1948 it combined with the Residential Hotel Association (founded 1918) to form the British Hotels and Restaurants Association (BHRA). When Prince George, Duke of Kent gave a toast at the 22nd Annual Luncheon, HRH commented the association's work by saying that \\"The hotel industry is important as a dispenser of happiness. With resolution on your part to provide the service required, there is no reason why the hotel trade in Great Britain should not enter into a new era of prosperity\\". The bombing of the Second World War had a serious effect on the hotel industry as many hotels were destroyed. It includes some notable names such as the Carlton (now New Zealand House). The association and the industry struggled but when the war was over, HRA worked hard to obtain a fair share of the building materials for refurbishments. In the early 1970s, HRA merged with the Caterer‚Äôs Association and was renamed as British Hotels, Restaurants and Caterers‚Äô Association (BHRCA). In a few years, BHRCA claimed to represent over half of the hotels with 5+ bedrooms across the UK. In the late 1980s, the association changed its name to its present form, the British Hospitality Association (designed by Saatchi and Saatchi), to make it shorter, be modern and reflect the wider industry it represents. Other successful campaigns include fighting a proposal by the EU to prevent business travellers from claiming VAT back and a proposal that hotels must pay more for television licences. At present, the BHA represents 40,000 establishments with over 500,000 employees across the UK (excluding NI); which includes hotels, restaurants, clubs, catering companies, food & service management and leisure outlets. Members range from independent businesses (73% of total number of members) to international groups (8%). One of the main agendas for the association in 2011 is a campaign to reduce the level of VAT charged to hotel rooms and attractions to increase competitiveness of the UK hospitality against other EU members which mostly charge a lower VAT rate for accommodation and food served in restaurants. = Restaurant Association = In 1967, a group of restaurateurs led by Rafael Calzada, proprietor of the Caprice, supported by Madame Prunier, proprietor of the Prunier‚Äôs Restaurant (now Marco Pierre White‚Äôs Luciano) and Manny Franks, who ran a small restaurant chain, claimed that BHRA (as it then was) ignored restaurants and decided to establish a new separate organisation, called the Restaurant Association of Great Britain (RAGB), which would represent solely restaurants interests. For nearly forty years, RAGB continued to represent the industry. However, due to the lack of support from major food chains, high costs and the need to present a united front, the RAGB had to merge with the BHA in 2003.  Structure  Apart from the head office in London, BHA operates a number of committees. Committees gather on a regular basis to discuss current activities and ‚Äòto shape BHA policy‚Äô. Typically, they consist of a chairman and between 20 and 25 company representatives. Each of them must be a BHA member and voted on an annual election process held by the association. Until 2012, there were two main committees that would oversee association‚Äôs day-to-day business - the BHA Council and the BHA National Executive. Both, however, were abolished at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 3 May in favour of a new Board of Directors. Some positions such as BHA President and BHA National Chairman were subsequently abolished as well. There are 16 additional committees working with specific issues, sector or a region. As for 2011, the full list of committees is as follows. Sector Committees: * Food and Service Management Forum * Local Hospitality Associations Committee * Restaurant Association National Committee * Motorway Services Area Operators‚Äô Committee * Clubs Panel Regional Committees: * BHA Scotland Committee * BHA Wales Committee * Northern Regional Committee * Heart of England Regional Committee * Eastern Regional Committee * South East Regional Committee * South West Regional Committee * London Policy Led Committees: * Employment Committee * Food and Technical Committee * Sustainability Committee  Membership  BHA has no special requirements to its prospective members regarding size. All the members must be within the United Kingdom (however, the overseas membership is possible in certain cases) and be hospitality-related. Nevertheless, educational establishments, suppliers, etc. can also join the association as affiliate members and receive the same benefits. Membership is annual and possible to join year-round. There is a range of rates depending on the type of an organisation and its size, starting from ¬£100 a year. The primary aim of the association is to lobby industry‚Äôs interests and to protect it from harmful legislation; however, it also offers some other benefits and services to its members. * All members receive a copy of all publications for free. * All members have free access (or at least substantial discounts) to the events organised by the BHA. * The association works in partnership with a number of organisations that provide services relevant to the industry in order to obtain special deals and discounts. * The BHA consults its members on health, legal and safety matters. * The association also updates all members on legislation that affects them and sends out regular business updates containing information regarding trends and developments in the industry. * Another service includes a free access to webinars where members can receive information regarding a number of issues including Fire Safety, Fraud, Employment Law, etc. Many top hotel chains and hospitality services provides are its members like Amadeus, Domino's Pizza, Hilton Worldwide, Macdonald Hotels, ThinkHotels.com etc. Partners Patrons Along with BHA‚Äôs members, BHA Patrons play a key role in supporting the association in its lobbying activities and day-to-day business. They also add some tangible benefits to the membership by providing special and exclusive services. The list of patrons includes some well-known companies such as Santander, Nestl√©, Philips, Coca-Cola and American Express. Preferred suppliers Preferred suppliers provide BHA members with preferential rates on their services, discounts and special offers. At present, there are about 30 preferred suppliers working with the BHA. Publications =Annual (Monthly) Report= The British Hospitality Association publishes a number of periodicals. The oldest publication is a Monthly Report which later became Annual Report and has been issued since December, 1913. The association saw a need in informing the members about its work but faced a problem as some of the matters discussed at the committee meetings were not possible to publish publicly. Therefore, the association decided to print its own monthly periodical. First Monthly reports were private and intended for members only. Each copy was numbered with the number of the member to whom it was sent. All copies issued prior to 1950s consisted of information regarding committee meetings, advertising (e.g. hotels for sale), advice (e.g. rationing during war years), legal updates, new members, etc. Since 1950, the report has become annual. File:IAHR_Monthly_Report_cover.pngCover of a first-ever Monthly Report, December 1913 File:BHA_Annual_Report_2012.png Cover of an Annual Report, July 2012 =Trends and Developments Report= Trends and Development (Statistics) is an annual report that has been issued since 1990. The report brings together statistics regarding the World Tourism and Hospitality industry. Such as, for example, employment levels, size of inbound, outbound & domestic tourism and financial highlights of the UK hotel, restaurant & catering industries. The publication is available for members for free as part of their subscription. However, non-members can purchase it as well. =Creating Jobs in Britain ‚Äì A Hospitality Economy Proposition= Creating Jobs in Britain is a report by the BHA that highlighted the hospitality‚Äôs contribution to the UK economy and stated that the industry can generate as many as 236,000 additional jobs if the Government provides the right framework. =BHRA Hotel and Restaurant Guide= In 1928, the association published its first guide to member hotels in Britain, Ireland, British dominions and colonies. The guide consisted of a short information regarding the prices charged for rooms, food, etc., size of an establishment, facilities such as telephone or running water, contact details and so forth. Later issues also included a road map and road mileage between major UK cities. Cover pages were highly influenced by culture and economic situation. Thus, 1947 version has all the signs of post war austerity when a copy issued in 1974 was visibly influenced by 1960s psychedelia movement. The publication was ceased in 1997.

The voice of the British Hospitality Association (2000‚Äì2006) Events =Hospitality and Tourism Summit= The Hospitality and Tourism Summit is aimed at underlining the economic importance of the hospitality industry within the UK economy and showcasing how other organisations can benefit from the Tourism industry. The first-ever The Hospitality and Tourism Summit 2012 was held at the InterContinental Park Lane, London on Friday 1 June and was attended by around 500 industry leaders, national & international government officials and others. The summit was followed by a Gala Diner. The event was free of charge for BHA members when all other tickets were on sale for around ¬£500. The 2012 event attracted some well-known names including, for example, John Penrose MP (The UK Minister for Tourism & Heritage), Kit Malthouse (The Deputy Mayor of London), Willie Walsh (CEO, British Airways), Taleb Rifai (Secretary of the UN World Tourism Organisation), Simon Vincent (Europe President of Hilton), Robin Rowland (CEO of Yo!Sushi), etc. =Young Chef Young Waiter= Young Chef Young Waiter (YCYW) is an annual skills competition for youths launched in 1984 which makes it the longest-established competition in the UK hospitality industry. The event is organised by the Restaurant Association. Entrants must be 25 years old or under and work for a hotel or a restaurant which is a member of the BHA. The competition is divided into three stages. First two are the regional finals held separately for Northern and Southern regions and the third is a national final followed by the award ceremony in London. At the regional finals chefs are being marked on their cooking skills and theoretical knowledge when waiters are tested on their service abilities (including wine, coffee, cheese knowledge), followed by a skills interview. As for the national final, succeeded chefs and waiters are put into pairs to prepare and serve lunch for the invited guests. In 2011, the RA broadened the award categories, and besides 1st, 2nd and 3rd places for each waiters and chefs, it gives prizes for Best Barista, Best Cheese Knowledge & Best Wine Knowledge for waiters and Best Dessert, Best Original Dish & Best Kitchen Craft for chefs. =Annual Luncheon= 22nd Annual Luncheon 1932 at Grosvenor House, London Annual Luncheon is an event that the organisation has been holding every year since its incorporation in 1910. During such gathering, all BHA members as well as those who ‚Äòplay a big role in supporting‚Äô the organisation are invited for a champagne reception followed by lunch. The most recent Annual Lunch was held at the 22nd of June 2011 at The Grosvenor House Hotel, London and was attended by 800 guests (including the BHA staff). The tickets were, however, not free even for members and were on sale for ¬£155 per person. =National Restaurateur‚Äôs Dinner= National Restaurateur‚Äôs Dinner (NRD) is a fund- raising event that has been taken place annually since 1987. The event is organised by three associations: the BHA, the Academy of Culinary Arts and the Academy of Food and Wine. All the profits collected from ticket sales and donations are used for training and educational programmes for chefs and waiters including the YCYW. NRD 2012 raised ¬£40,000, one-third of which were allocated to the BHA. Campaigns =2012= VAT Cut In 2011, the British Hospitality Association decided to merge its campaign to reduce the rate of VAT in the UK charged to hospitality establishment with British Association of British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Amusements, the Federation of Small Business and the Tourism Alliance. The campaign is chaired by Graham Wason who has been involved in the earlier campaigns since 1993. In 2012, the BHA announce that the current economic climate is not suitable for cutting the rate for meal providers and therefore, divided its campaign into two stages. * Stage one: To reduce the VAT rate for accommodation and attractions * Stage two: To reduce the VAT rate for meal providers. BHA‚Äôs main argument is that the current rate of 20 per cent is the second-highest in the EU which makes the UK uncompetitive. The association also pledges that the reduction of the VAT will contribute additional ¬£2.6 billion over a decade and create 79,000 jobs ‚Äì according to BHA‚Äôs research. PPL The association responded to the initiative by Phonographic Performance ltd. to increase fees for Specially Featured Entertainment. The BHA held several meeting with the PPL and it was agreed that the authority would not increase any tariffs before the January 2013 (not April 2012 as originally proposed). National Minimum Wage The BHA submitted written evidence to the Low Pay Commission which recommends changes in the national wage. Olympics The association was chosen by the Community Safety and Security Project to inform its members regarding the security developments in London area. Shops and Restaurants The BHA addressed the Government to give the industry more flexibility ‚Äì as for example, to abandon planning permissions required to convert a shop into a restaurant. Bed Tax Two councils in Scotland, Edinburgh and York, in attempt to raise finances, decided to introduce Bed Tax ‚Äì a tax collected from each visitor staying in a hotel. BHA Northern Committee‚Äô Chief Executive, Simon Kershaw, with the support from other Scottish hoteliers pressed the councils into realising that it was in their authority to introduce such measures. Car Parking-Westminster After the Westminster City Council announced the possibility of tighter parking restrictions in the borough, the BHA pointed out that it would be damaging for the hospitality businesses in the area. The council abandon the plan under the pressure from the BHA and the industry. =2011= Regulation BHA‚Äôs Chairman, Alan Parker CBE, was invited by the UK Minister for Tourism and Heritage to chair a tourism industry regulation task to reduce the red tape. London Tourism Funding The BHA was disappointed by the Prime Minister‚Äôs plan to close the London Development Agency. The association lobbied Boris Johnson and the Department for Business to save VisitLondon. Later, the London Mayor, Boris Johnson, agreed to offer ¬£14m a year for a new promotional agency, London and Partners. Digital Economy BHA responded with concern to Ofcom consultation on the implementation of the Digital Economy Act 2010 which would mean that hotels‚Äô and restaurants‚Äô Wi-Fi and broadband facilities could be restricted in case when an illegal download by one of the guests took place.

Dr. Swartley was the founder of the Centers for the Whole Person in Philadelphia, Mays Landing, NJ, New York, and Toronto. He was also a founder, in 1973, of the International Primal Association and was its first Executive Secretary. He was educated at Haverford College, The University of T√ºbingen, the Jung Institute of Zurich, the California Institute of Integral Studies, the University of the Pacific, and during significant time spent in India. Swartley was influenced by the work of Carl Jung, Roberto Assagioli, R.D. Laing, Frederick Leboyer, Fritz Perls, Alexander Lowen, Stanislav Grof, Alan Watts, Thomas Verny, Paul Bindrim and many others. He was active in the American Psychological Association and promoted international cooperation in psychology in his workshops throughout North America and Europe. Swartley developed 'Primal Integration' starting from about 1962. He summarized this development as follows: > Primal Integration is one of a number of primally oriented human maturation > techniques which have evolved during the 1970's...The third 'new' thing > about primal techniques is the adaption I have developed for use with > average, maturing adults, called Primal Integration. Primal Integration > utilizes regressive techniques with average adults within an educational > rather than a therapeutic framework. That is, Primal Integration rejects the > authoritarian medical model of treatment, and is an education rather than a > therapy...Primal Integration, is a contribution of the Encounter Group > Movement which began on the East and West coasts of the United States during > 1962, grandfathered by Maslow and Perls. Thus, Primal Integration may be > viewed historically as a child of the union of regressive psychotherapy and > the Encounter Movement. (Swartley1975) He devoted the last ten years of his life promoting primal integration through workshops, training, lectures, and writings until his death in 1979 at the age of 52. Dr. Johann-Georg Raben (Ph.D.), a German Psychologist, has written his doctoral dissertation (approx. 600 pages) about Bill Swartley's therapeutic approach. Raben describes in his dissertation the history, theory and practice of Swartley's maturation techniques, based on his own experiences during two workshops led by Swartley in Bavaria, Germany, and London, England, around 1978, and by citing (in German translation) various papers that he received from Swartley, and commenting on them. The title of the dissertation is: William Swartleys Integrative Prim√§rtherapie (\\"Primal Integration\\"). Raben received his doctoral degree in 1984 at the Psychological Institute of the University of Salzburg, Austria. -- In the years 1978-1982 Raben had had a post of \\"wissenschaftlicher Assistent\\" (scientific assistant) at the Institute for Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the Technical University (TU) of Munich, led by the psychoanalyst and psychotherapist Prof. Dr. med. et phil. Albert G√∂rres (see Wikipedia), who sympathized with Arthur Janov's Primal Therapy und used Primal techniques. Raben's job at the institute was to collect literature about the different \\"cathartic therapies\\". This voluminous collection of literature (including papers about Swartley's Primal Integration) was around 1995 conferred into the archive of the Institut f√ºr Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene (IGPP) in Freiburg im Breisgau, Southern Germany.

The direct comparison of expression patterns of metastasis-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in primary CRCs (pCRCs) and matched liver metastases (LMs) provides a feasibility of their clinical application as metastasis-specific biomarkers. In a clinical study it has been found that miR-885-5p is increased in plasma from pre-eclampsia compared with healthy pregnant women, and it is released into circulation mainly inside exosomes. = Cancer = In search of an effective therapeutic strategy for improving colon cancer treatment, a novel role of miR-885-3p has been observed in tumor angiogenesis by targeting BMPR1A, which regulates a proangiogenic factor, and provide new evidence that targeting miRNAs might be an effective therapeutic strategy.

Arabic was spoken mainly in Arabia, North Africa, Mesopotamia and the Levant. Throughout the vast Ottoman bureaucracy Ottoman Turkish language was the official language, a version of Turkish, albeit with a vast mixture of both Arabic and Persian grammar and vocabulary. Virtually all intellectual and literate pursuits were taken in Turkish language. Some ordinary people had to hire special \\"request-writers\\" (arzuh√¢lcis) to be able to communicate with the government. The ethnic groups continued to speak within their families and neighborhoods (mahalles) with their own languages (e.g., Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc.) In villages where two or more populations lived together, the inhabitants would often speak each other's language. In cosmopolitan cities, people often spoke their family languages, many non-ethnic Turks spoke Turkish as a second language. Educated Ottoman Turks spoke Arabic and Persian, as these were the main foreign languages in the pre-Tanzimat era, with the former being used for science and the latter for literary affairs. \\\\- From: Akdeniz Language Studies Conference 2012 - Cited: p. 1091. In the last two centuries, French and English emerged as popular languages, especially among the Christian Levantine communities. The elite learned French at school, and used European products as a fashion statement. The use of Ottoman Turkish for science and literature grew steadily under the Ottomans, while Persian declined in those functions. Ottoman Turkish, during the period, gained many loanwords from Arabic and Persian. Up to 88% of the vocabulary of a particular work would be borrowed from those two languages. Linguistic groups were varied and overlapping. In the Balkan Peninsula, Slavic, Greek and Albanian speakers were the majority, but there were substantial minorities of Turks and Romance- speaking Vlachs. In most of Anatolia, Turkish was the majority language, but Greek, Armenian and, in the east and southeast, Kurdish were also spoken. In Syria, Iraq, Arabia, Egypt and north Africa, most of the population spoke varieties of Arabic with, above them, a Turkish-speaking elite. However, in no province of the Empire was there a unique language. Translations of government documents As a result of having multiple linguistic groups, the Ottoman authorities had government documents translated into other languages in the pre-Tanzimat era.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 22 (PDF p. 24) Some translators were renowned in their language groups while others chose not to state their names in their works.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 24 (PDF p. 26) Documents translated into minority languages include the Edict of G√ºlhane, the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856, the Ottoman Penal Code (Ceza Kanunnamesi), the Ottoman Commercial Code (Ticaret Kanunnamesi), the Provincial Reform Law (Vilayet Kanunnamesi), the Ottoman Code of Public Laws (D√ºstur),Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 23 (PDF p. 25) the Mecelle,Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 31 (PDF p. 33) and the Ottoman Constitution of 1876.Strauss, \\"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire,\\" (), Google Books PT193.

Among the people using French as a lingua franca were Sephardic Jews, which adopted French as their primary language due to influence from the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. Two factions opposing Sultan Abdul Hamid, the Ottoman Armenian and Young Turk groups, both used French.

In 1827 Sultan Mahmud II announced that the empire's first medical school, the Imperial Military School of Medicine, would for the time being teach in French; that school and a civil medical school both taught in French. By the 1860s advocates of French medium instruction and Ottoman Turkish medium instruction were engaged in a conflict; Turks advocated for Turkish while minoritarian groups and foreigners advocated for French. Spyridon Mavrogenis, employed in the imperial medical school as a professor, advocated for the usage of French. \\\\- First published November 1, 2003. - Cited: p. 228 (PDF p. 3/5).

She works focuses on contemporary female identity and its relationship to patriarchal culture. She also highlights political and social injustice. \\"Bambi\\" is derived from the childhood family nickname \\"Bambino\\" and is a popular artist within the showbusiness world. Collectors of her work include Rihanna, Brad Pitt, Adele, Robbie Williams, and Take That's Mark Owen. Bambi‚Äôs stencilled work is described as gritty and masculine in appearance while exploring themes of feminism, and popular and street culture.  Works  Amy Winehouse, Camden Bambi is recognised for her stencilled graffiti and has created various works across London. Bambi first gained attention for her 2011 piece 'Amy Jade' a tribute to the late singer Amy Winehouse in Camden and \\"Diamonds A Girls Best Friend' depicting a young Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Diamonds, as featured in Time Magazine in 2012. Lie Lie Land, 2017, London In February 2017 Bambi stencilled a mural called \\"Lie Lie Land\\" on the wall of the Cross Street Gallery at the corner of 40 Cross St and Shillingford St, Islington, featuring former British Prime Minister Theresa May and American President Donald Trump in the dance pose from the poster of the movie La La Land. The work became a tourist attraction until it was painted over by new owners in January 2018. The Pope Gives Us Hope, 2017, Venice In her first Italian solo show, Bambi exhibited during the 57th Venice Biennale. Bambi revealed a waterfront piece 'The Pope Gives Us Hope' featuring the Pope reaching out to a polar bear in a capsizing boat; the work is designed to reflect the Pope‚Äôs comments in late 2016 on climate change and his call to end environmental destruction. A long- term environmentalist, Bambi was further inspired after watching the issue- driven documentary Before the Flood by Leonardo DiCaprio and Fisher Stevens. The work can be seen at Ospizio Foscolo Santa Lucia in Fondamenta Sant‚ÄôAnna 993/a, Castello 30122. Be As Naughty As You Want, 2017 On 31 August 2017, on the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death, Bambi unveiled 'Be As Naughty As You Want'. The piece presents Diana as Disney‚Äôs Mary Poppins, being carried into the sky by her magical flying umbrella, watched by Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The work is at the entrance to Neal's Yard, off Monmouth Street in Covent Garden, London. Bambi Street Art for Global Climate Change Protests that appeared in Belsize Park London in Sep19 In September 2019, around the date of the Global Climate Change protests, a Bambi street art picture appeared on the side of a residential building in Belsize Place, NW3, London. The piece presents an ape holding a placard saying \\"SAVE OUR HOMOSAPIENS, David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg holding a placard saying \\"SKOLSTREJK F√ñR KLIMATET\\" (school strike for the climate).  Personal life  Bambi's identity is a well-guarded secret with the artist withholding much information about her personal life. In a 2014 Daily Mail interview Bambi said she studied at the City & Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, South London before gaining an MA from St Martin‚Äôs School of Art.  History  In 2010, the vandalism of a popular Bambi stencil in Primrose Hill reignited the long-running London debate over the preservation of street art and resulted in Islington councilors proposing a community committee be established to rule on the future protection of street art. In early 2011, Bambi commemorated the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton with the satirical slogan 'A Bit Like Marmite' across their chests. In 2014 artnet news named Bambi as one of their Top 20 Art World Women of 2014. The list included artist Marina Abramovic and singer Beyonc√©.  Controversy  Shark with Butterfly In 2014 Bambi produced five shark murals for an Islington pop-up gallery in a building site. Estimated to have been worth over ¬£20,000, the murals were stolen overnight by thieves who climbed over a wall and broke into the redevelopment area. The stolen pieces were going to be sold at auction for the charity Art Against Knives before the robbery took place.

Defra, published July 2017, retrieved 20 July 2017. Humans can catch bTB, but public health control measures, including milk pasteurisation and the BCG vaccine, mean it is not a significant risk to human health. The disease affects cattle and other farm animals (including pigs, goats, deer, sheep, alpacas and llamas), some species of wildlife including badgers and deer, and some domestic pets such as cats. Geographically, bTB has spread from isolated pockets in the late 1980s to cover large areas of the west and south-west of England and Wales in the 2010s. Some people believe this correlates with the lack of badger control. In October 2013, culling in England was controversially trialled in two pilot areas in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset. The main aim of these trials was to assess the humaneness of culling using \\"free shooting\\" (previous methods trapped the badgers in cages before shooting them). The trials were repeated in 2014 and 2015, and expanded to a larger area in 2016 and 2017. As of 2019, there is no UK-wide policy of badger culling. Status of badgers European badgers (Meles meles) are not an endangered species, but they are among the most legally-protected wild animals in the UK, being shielded under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Arguments for culling Prior to the 2012/13 badger cull, the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stated that badger control was needed because \\"...we still need to tackle TB in order to support high standards of animal health and welfare, to promote sustainable beef and dairy sectors, to meet EU legal and trade requirements and to reduce the cost and burden on farmers and taxpayers.\\" This report listed the following reasons for bTB control:- * Protect the health of the public and maintain public confidence in the safety of products entering the food chain. * Protect and promote the health and welfare of animals. * Meet UK international (in particular EU) and domestic legal commitments and maintain the UK‚Äôs reputation for safe and high quality food. * Maintain productive and sustainable beef and dairy sectors in England, securing opportunities for international trade and minimising environmental impacts. * Reduce the cost of bTB to farmers and taxpayers. =Disease= Mycobacterium bovis Humans can become infected by the Mycobacterium bovis bacterium, which causes the disease \\"bovine TB\\" (bTB). Between 1994 and 2011, there were 570 human cases of bovine TB in humans. Most of these cases are thought to be in people aged 45 or over, who could have been infected before milk pasteurisation became common in the UK. One route of transmission to humans is drinking infected, non-pasteurised milk (pasteurisation kills the bacterium). European badgers can become infected with bTB and transmit the disease to cattle, thereby posing a risk to the human food chain. Culling is a method used in parts of the UK to reduce the number of badgers and thereby reduce the incidence and spread of bTB that might infect humans. Once an animal has contracted bTB, the disease can be spread through the sett via the exhalations or excretions of infected individuals. Modern cattle housing, which has good ventilation, makes this process relatively less effective, but in older-style cattle housing or in badger setts, the disease can spread more rapidly. Badgers range widely at night, potentially spreading bTB over long distances. Badgers mark their territory with urine, which can contain a high proportion of bTB bacteria. According to the RSPCA, the infection rate among badgers is 4‚Äì6%. In 2014, bTB was mostly concentrated in the south-west of England. It is thought to have re-emerged because of the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak which led to thousands of cattle being slaughtered and farmers all over the UK having to buy new stock. There appears to have been undiscovered bTB in some of these replacement animals. Action on eradicating bTB is a devolved issue. Defra works with the Devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for coherent and joined-up policies for the UK as a whole. The Chief Veterinary Officers and lead TB policy officials from each country meet on a monthly basis to discuss bTB issues through the UK bTB Liaison Group. =Cost of bTB= The government had already paid substantial compensation to farmers because of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the bluetongue outbreak in 2007, against the background of EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis or enzootic bovine leucosis. In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of ¬£1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving compensation payments of around ¬£1,000 on animals valued at over ¬£3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.R (Partridge Farms Ltd) v SSEFRA [2008] EWHC 1645 (Admin); R (Partridge Farms Ltd) v SSEFRA [2009] EWCA Civ 284. Some farmers' organisations and Defra are in favour of a policy of badger culling because of the mounting costs of the disease to farmers; cattle testing positive for a bTB test must be slaughtered and the farmer paid compensation. Furthermore, these organisations feel that alternatives to culling are not cost-effective. In 2005, attempts to eradicate bTB in the UK cost ¬£90 million. In 2009/10, controlling bTB cost the taxpayer ¬£63 million in England with an additional ¬£8.9 million spent on research. In 2010/11, nearly 25,000 cattle were slaughtered in England alone, and the cost to the taxpayer of disease control was ¬£91 million; 90% of this amount was accounted for by Government-funded cattle testing and compensation payments to farmers for slaughtered animals. During 2010, 10.8% of herds in England were under restrictions, whilst in the West and South-West, this figure was more than double the average at 22.8%. In a Defra report in 2011, it was stated that the number of new bTB incidents in England rose in 2010, compared to 2009, and suggested the disease situation was not improving. It was concluded \\"...the cost to the taxpayer is huge ‚Äì it is set to exceed ¬£1 billion over the next ten years in England alone.\\" Individual farms There are also considerable costs for farmers, including losses incurred as a result of movement restrictions, having to buy replacement animals, and supporting the required programme of bTB testing (animals must be tested routinely, a repeat test is required if the first is positive, and a pre-movement test is needed if a herd has infection) in a herd. It is more difficult to quantify the costs to the industry but they must run into tens of millions of pounds a year. The average cost of a bTB breakdown in a cattle herd in England is approximately ¬£30,000. About ¬£20,000 of this is paid by the Government, primarily as compensation for animals compulsorily slaughtered and costs of testing. This leaves approximately ¬£10,000 needing to be paid by farmers as a result of their consequential losses (loss of earnings e.g. milk sales of culled cows), on-farm costs of testing, and disruption to business through movement restrictions.DEFRA 2011, page 1 Arguments against culling The risk of humans contracting bTB from milk is extremely low if certain precautions are taken, and scientists have argued that badger culling is unnecessary. The low risk is accepted by Defra who wrote in a report published in 2011: \\"The risk to public health is very low these days, largely thanks to milk pasteurisation and the TB surveillance and control programme in cattle\\". Animal welfare groups such as the Badger Trust and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are opposed to what they consider random slaughter of badgers ‚Äî which have special legal protection in the UK ‚Äî in return for what they describe as a relatively small impact on bTB. Fallow deer (Dama dama) are also carriers of bTB Cattle and badgers are not the only carriers of bTB. The disease can infect and be transmitted by domestic animals such as cats and dogs, wildlife such as deer and farm livestock such as horses and goats. Although the frequency of infection from other mammals is generally much less than in cattle and badgers other species of wildlife have been shown as a possible carriers of bTB. In some areas of South-West England, deer, especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour, have been implicated as a possible maintenance host for transmission of bTB. It has been argued that in some localised areas, the risk of transmission to cattle from fallow deer is greater than it is from badgers. M. bovis was shown to be hosted and transmitted to humans by cats in March 2014 when Public Health England announced two people in England developed bTB infections after contact with a domestic cat. The two human cases were linked to nine cases of bTB infection in cats in Berkshire and Hampshire during 2013. These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human TB transmission. Research reported in 2016 indicates that bTB is not transmitted by direct contact between badgers and cattle, but through contaminated pasture and dung. This has important implications for farm practices such as the spreading of slurry. Using a GPS collar small enough to be worn by badgers, the researchers tracked more than 400 cattle when they were in the territories of 100 badgers. In 65,000 observations only once did a badger get within 10 metres of a cow ‚Äì the badgers preferred to be 50 m away. Experts were quoted as saying expansion of the cull ‚Äúflies in the face of scientific evidence‚Äù and that the cull is a ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù waste of time and money. Alternatives to culling Under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the culling of badgers is only permitted as part of a bTB reduction strategy if there is no satisfactory alternative. There is widespread public support for an alternative to culling. In October 2012, MPs voted 147 in favour of a motion to stop the 2012/2013 badger cull and 28 against. The debate had been prompted by a petition on the government's e-petition website, which at the time had exceeded 150,000 signatories, and which had by June 2013 gathered around a quarter of a million signatories. By the time it closed on 7 September 2013 there were 303,929 signatures breaking the record for the largest number of people ever to sign a government e-petition.MPs vote 147 to 28 for abandoning cull entirely, The Guardian (London), published 25 October 2012, retrieved 26 January 2013. =Vaccination= In July 2008, Hilary Benn, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, made a statement which highlighted actions other than culling, including allocating funding of ¬£20m to the development of an effective TB injectable vaccine for cattle and badgers, and an oral badger vaccine. In March 2010, Defra licensed a vaccine for badgers, called the Badger BCG. The vaccine is only effective on animals that do not already have the disease and it can only be delivered by injection. It is available on prescription, subject to a licence to trap badgers from Natural England, but only where injections are carried out by trained vaccinators. Defra funded a programme of vaccinations in 2010/11, and other organisations that have funded smaller vaccination programmes include the National Trust in Devon, the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, and a joint project by the National Farmers' Union and the Badger Trust.DEFRA 2011, page 7 However, in England, the Government views badger vaccination as a necessary part of a package of measures for controlling bTB, because it estimates the cost of vaccination to be around ¬£2,250 per square kilometre per annum, and notes that most landowners and farmers have little interest in paying this cost themselves. In Wales, badger vaccination is carried out in preference to culling. Whilst a field trial into the vaccination of badgers is under way in the Republic of Ireland, as yet, neither culling nor vaccination is carried out in Northern Ireland, although the Northern Ireland Assembly has carried out a review into bTB that recently recommended an immediate investigation into the viability of culling and/or vaccination. In autumn 2009, Scotland was declared officially tuberculosis-free under EU rules, so there are no proposals to cull badgers there. Although vaccinating cattle is a recognised method of avoiding killing wildlife but reducing the prevalence, incidence and spread of bTB in the cattle population and could also reduce the severity of a herd infection regardless of whether infection is introduced by wildlife or cattle it has three problems. * As with all vaccines, a cattle vaccine will not guarantee that all vaccinated animals are fully protected from infection. * Current research suggests that re-vaccination is likely to be necessary on an annual basis to maintain a sufficient level of protection in individual animals. * The BCG vaccine can make cattle sensitive to the tuberculin skin test after vaccination. this means the animal may have a positive result, even though it is not actually infected with M. bovis (a \\"false positive‚Äü). In parallel with developing the vaccine, Defra are developing a test to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (so-called \\"DIVA\\" test). This test is based on gamma interferon blood test technology. The intention is that when necessary, it can be used alongside the tuberculin skin test to confirm whether a positive skin test is caused by infection or vaccination. This is critical because without this differentiation, the UK could not be declared officially free of bTB, which is required by a 1964 European Economic Community directive for international trade. Given that in 2014 there is still no bTB vaccine for cattle that does not interfere with the tuberculin tests, such vaccination is prohibited under EU law. As of 2011, Defra have invested around ¬£18 million in the development of cattle vaccines and associated diagnostic tools. All transmissible livestock diseases can be mitigated by generic good husbandry practices. BTB risks can be reduced by carefully balanced diets for the cattle, careful sourcing of replacement stock, maintaining correct stocking densities and keeping sheds clean and well ventilated. History =Pre-1992= The entrance to a badger sett down which gas canisters are thrown during gassing. Many badgers in Europe were gassed during the 1960s and 1970s to control rabies.The European badger (Meles meles) . badger.org.uk The organism that causes bTB, Mycobacterium bovis, was discovered in 1882, but it took until 1960 for compulsory tests for the disease to be brought in, previously testing was voluntary. Herds that were attested TB free were tested annually and received a premium of 1d per gallon for their milk. Those not tested were able to carry on trading without testing. A programme of test-and-slaughter began and was successful. Until the 1980s, badger culling in the UK was undertaken in the form of gassing. By 1960 it was thought that bTB might have been eradicated in the UK, until 1971 when a new population of tuberculous badgers was located in Gloucestershire. Subsequent experiments showed that bTB can be spread from badgers to cattle, and some farmers tried to cull badgers on their land. Wildlife protection groups lobbied Parliament which responded by passing the Badgers Act 1973, making it an offence to attempt to kill, take, injure badgers or interfere with their setts without a licence. These laws are now contained in the Protection of Badgers Act 1992.Protection of Badgers Act 1992, s.10. =Randomised Badger Culling Trials (1998‚Äì2008)= In 1997, an independent scientific body issued the Krebs Report. This concluded there was a lack of evidence about whether badger culling would help control the spread of bTB and proposed a series of trials. The government then ordered an independently run series of trials, known as the Randomised Badger Culling Trials (RBCT). These trials, in which 11,000 badgers in selected areas were cage-trapped and killed, were conducted from 1998 to 2005, although they were briefly suspended due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth in 2001. The incidence of bTB in and around 10 large (100 km2) areas in which annual badger culling occurred was compared with the incidence in and around 10 matched areas with no such culling. In 2003, as a result of initial findings from the RBCT, the reactive component of the culling where badgers were culled in and around farms where bTB was present in cattle, was suspended. This was because the RBCT recorded a 27% increase in bTB outbreaks in these areas of the trial compared to areas in which no culling took place. The advisory group of the trials concluded that reactive culling could not be used to control bTB. In December 2005, a preliminary analysis of the RBCT data showed that proactive culling, in which most badgers in a particular area were culled, reduced the incidence of bTB by 19% within the cull area, however, it increased by 29% within 2 km outside the cull area. The report therefore warned of a \\"perturbation effect\\" in which culling leads to changes in badger behaviour thereby increasing infections within the badger colonies and the migration of infected badgers to previously uninfected areas. Whilst culling produced a decreased badger population locally, it disrupted the badgers‚Äô territorial system, causing any surviving badgers to range more widely, which itself led to a substantial increase in the incidence of the disease, and its wider dispersal. It also reported that a culling policy \\"would incur costs that were between four and five times higher than the economic benefits gained\\" and \\"if the predicted detrimental effects in the surrounding areas are included, the overall benefits achieved would fall to approximately one-fortieth of the costs incurred\\". In summary, the report argued that it would be more cost-effective to improve cattle control measures, with zoning and supervision of herds, than it would be to cull badgers. In 2007, the final results of the trials, conducted by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, were submitted to David Miliband, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The report stated that \\"badger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain. Indeed, some policies under consideration are likely to make matters worse rather than better\\". According to the report: In October 2007, after considering the report and consulting other advisors, the then government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir David King produced a report of his own which concluded that culling could indeed make a useful contribution to controlling bTB. This was criticised by scientists, most notably in the editorial of \\"Nature\\", which implied King was being influenced by politics. In July 2008, Hilary Benn, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, refused to authorise a badger cull because of the practicalities and cost of a cull and the scale and length of time required to implement it, with no guarantee of success and the potential for making the disease worse. Benn went on to highlight other measures that would be taken, including allocating ¬£20m to the development of an effective injectable TB vaccine for both cattle and badgers, and an oral badger vaccine. Follow-up report In 2010, a scientific report was published in which bTB incidence in cattle was monitored in and around RBCT areas after culling ended. The report showed that the benefits inside culled areas decreased over time and were no longer detectable three years after culling ceased. In areas adjoining those which culled, a trend indicated beneficial effects immediately after the end of culling were insignificant, and had disappeared 18 months after the cull ceased. The report also stated that the financial costs of culling an idealized 150 km2 area would exceed the savings achieved through reduced bTB by factors of 2 to 3.5. The report concluded \\"These results, combined with evaluation of alternative culling methods, suggest that badger culling is unlikely to contribute effectively to the control of cattle TB in Britain.\\" =The Bovine TB Eradication Group for England (2008)= In November 2008, The Bovine TB Eradication Group for England was set up. This Group included Defra officials, members from the veterinary profession and farming industry representatives. Based on research published up to February 2010, the Group concluded that the benefits of the cull were not sustained beyond the culling and that it was ineffective method of controlling bTB in Britain. They said: =Post-2010= After the 2010 general election, the new Welsh Environment Minister, John Griffiths, ordered a review of the scientific evidence in favour of and against a cull. The incoming Defra Secretary of State, Caroline Spelman, began her Bovine TB Eradication Programme for England, which she described as \\"a science-led cull of badgers in the worst- affected areas\\". The Badger Trust put it differently, saying \\"badgers are to be used as target practice\\". Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh said it was prompted by \\"short-term political calculation\\". The Badger Trust brought court action against the government. On 12 July 2012, their case was dismissed in the High Court; the Trust appealed unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, the Humane Society International pursued a parallel case through the European Courts which was also unsuccessful. Rural Economy and Land Use Programme fellow Angela Cassidy has identified one of the major forces underlying the opposition to badger culls as originating in the historically positive fictional depictions of badgers in British literature. Cassidy further noted that modern negative depictions have recently seen a resurgence. In August 2015 it was announced culling would be rolled out in Dorset with a target of 615 to 835 badgers being culled there, while also being continued in Gloucestershire and Somerset. Licences were granted to allow six weeks of continuous culling in the three counties until 31 January. In December 2015, Defra released documents confirming the badger cull had \\"met government targets\\" with 756 animals culled in Dorset, 432 in Gloucestershire and 279 in Somerset. =Wales (2009/12)= In 2009, the Welsh Assembly authorised a non- selective badger cull in the Tuberculosis Eradication (Wales) Order 2009; the Badger Trust sought a judicial review of the decision, but their application was declined. The Badger Trust appealed in Badger Trust v Welsh Ministers [2010] EWCA Civ 807; the Court of Appeal ruled that the 2009 Order should be quashed. The Welsh Assembly replaced proposals for a cull in 2011 with a five- year vaccination programme following a review of the science. =The 2012/13 cull (England)= As an attempt to reduce the economic costs of live cage- trapping followed by shooting used in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, the post-2010 culls in England also allowed for the first time, \\"free shooting\\", i.e. shooting free-roaming badgers with firearms. Licences to cull badgers under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 are available from Natural England, who require applicants to show that they have the skills, training and resources to cull in an efficient, humane and effective way, and to provide a Badger Control Plan. This meant that farmers were allowed to shoot the badgers themselves, or to employ suitably qualified persons to do this. The actual killing of the badgers was funded by the farmers, whereas the monitoring and data analysis was funded by Defra. Aims A Defra statement published in October 2012, stated that \\"The aim of this monitoring is to test the assumption that controlled shooting is a humane culling technique.\\" The statement makes no indication that the cull would assess the effectiveness of reducing bTB in the trial areas. A Badger Trust statement indicated the 2012/13 badger cull had three specific aims: # Whether badger cull targets for each pilot area can be met within six weeks with at least 70% of the badger population removed in each cull area. # Whether shooting ‚Äòfree-running‚Äô badgers at night is a humane way of killing badgers. # Whether shooting at night is safe with reference to the general public, pets and livestock. Again, the statement makes no indication that the cull would assess the effectiveness of reducing bTB in the trial areas. Concerns regarding free shooting Permission to allow free shooting for the first time during the cull of 2012/13 raised several concerns. * It was suggested that one method to avoid endangering the public would be for shooters to stand over setts and shoot badgers near the entrances. However, a report to Defra by The Game Conservancy Trust (2006) indicated that a major problem with shooting near the sett is that wounded badgers are very likely to bolt underground, preventing a second shot to ensure the animal is killed. Under these conditions the first shot must cause the badger to collapse on the spot, limiting the choice of target sites to the spine, neck or head. * Colin Booty, the RSPCA's deputy head of wildlife, said: \\"Shooting badgers might be very different from shooting foxes, say, because their anatomy is very different. The badger has a very thick skull, thick skin and a very thick layer of subcutaneous fat. It has a much more robust skeleton than the fox. Because of the short, squat body and the way its legs work, these legs often partly conceal the main killing zone. Free shooting carries a high risk of wounding.\\" Economic costs In 2014, the policing costs in Gloucestershire were ¬£1.7 million over the seven-week period (¬£1,800 per badger) and in Somerset, the cost of policing amounted to ¬£739,000 for the period. Government announcement On 19 July 2011, Caroline Spelman, the then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, announced the Government response to the consultation. It was proposed that a cull would be conducted within the framework of the new \\"Bovine TB Eradication Programme for England\\".> In view of concerns in response to the initial consultation, a further consultation would determine whether a cull could be effectively enforced and monitored by Natural England under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. The cull would initially be piloted in two areas, before being extended to other parts of the country. Implementation In December 2011, the Government announced that it intended to go forward with trial badger culls in two 150 km2 areas. These would take place over a 6-week period with the aim of reducing the badger population by 70% in each area. Farmers and land-owners would be licensed to control badgers by shooting and would bear the costs of any culls. The Government was to bear the costs of licensing and monitoring the culls. The Government would monitor: * actions taken under the licence * the impact on cattle herd breakdowns (becoming infected with bTB) within the areas culled or vaccinated * humaneness of the culling methods * impacts on the remaining badger population In March 2012, the Government appointed members to an Independent Panel of Experts (IPE) to oversee the monitoring and evaluation of the pilot areas and report back to Government. The panel‚Äôs role was to evaluate the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of the controlled shooting method, not the effectiveness of badger culling to control TB in cattle. The cull was to begin in 2012 led by Defra. However, the Secretary of State for Environment, Owen Paterson, announced in a statement to Parliament on 23 October 2012 that a cull would be postponed until 2013 with a wide range of reasons given. On 27 August 2013, a full culling programme began in two pilot areas, one mainly in West Somerset and the other mainly in West Gloucestershire with a part in Southeast Herefordshire, at an estimated cost of ¬£7 million per trial area. Up to 5,094 badgers were to be shot. The URL is not actually dead, but the content has changed. There were closed seasons during the cull, designed to prevent distress to animals or their dependent offspring.DEFRA 2011, pages 9‚Äì11 Data collected Shooters failed to kill the target of 70% of badgers in both trial areas during the initial 6-week cull. During this time, 850 badgers were killed in Somerset and 708 in Gloucestershire. Of the badgers culled in Gloucestershire, 543 were killed through free shooting whilst 165 were cage- trapped and shot. In Somerset, 360 badgers were killed by free shooting and 490 by being cage-trapped then shot. Because the target of 70% badgers to be culled had not been achieved, the cull period was extended. During the 3-week extension in Somerset, an extra 90 badgers were culled, taking the total across the whole cull period to 940, representing a 65% reduction in the estimated badger population. During the 5 weeks and 3 days extension in Gloucestershire, 213 further badgers were culled, giving an overall total of 921, representing a reduction of just under 40% in the estimated badger population. Defra and Natural England were unwilling to divulge what data would be collected and the methods of collection during the pilot culls. However, in a decision under the Freedom of information in the United Kingdom act dated 6 August 2013, the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office found that Defra was wrong to apply the Environmental Information Regulations in defence of its refusal to disclose information about the pilot cull methods. Defra originally intended to sample 240 badgers killed during the pilot culls but confirmed only 120 badgers targeted were to be collected for examination of humaneness and that half of these badgers would be shot while caged. Therefore, only 1.1% of badgers killed by free shooting were tested for humaneness of shooting. No badgers were to be tested for bTB. Details of the ongoing pilot culls were not released whilst they were being conducted and Defra declined to divulge how the success of the trials would be measured. As a result, scientists, the RSPCA and other animal charities called for greater transparency over the pilot badger culls. Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, confirmed that the purpose of the pilot culls was to assess whether farmer-led culls deploying controlled shooting of badgers is suitable to be rolled-out to up to 40 new areas over the next four years. Farming minister, David Heath, admitted in correspondence with Lord Krebs that the cull would \\"not be able to statistically determine either the effectiveness (in terms of badgers removed) or humaneness of controlled shooting\\". Lord Krebs, who led the Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the 1990s, said the two pilots \\"will not yield any useful information\\". In explaining why the culling had missed the target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson famously commented that \\"the badgers moved the goalposts.\\" Effectiveness of the cull Leaks reported by the BBC in February 2014 indicated that the Expert Panel found that less than half of all badgers were killed in both trial areas. It was also revealed that between 6.8% and 18% of badgers took more than five minutes to die the standard originally set was that this should be less than 5%. It has been suggested that as culling was not selective, as many as six out of seven badgers killed could have been perfectly healthy and bTB free. Scientific experts agree that culling where there are \\"hard boundaries\\" to the cull zones, on a large and long-term scale, could yield modest benefits. If there are 'soft boundaries' allowing badgers to escape, then it will also make things worse for farmers bordering on the cull areas due to infected badgers dispersing: the so-called \\"perturbation\\" effect.The Bow Group: Bow Group urges Government to scrap badger cull plans, published 25 March 2012, retrieved 4 April 2013. The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) concluded \\"the form and duration of badger social perturbation is still poorly understood and significant changes to our assumption may alter the order of preference [of the proposed options].\\"FERA Report commissioned by DEFRA 2010: Comparing badger (Meles meles) control strategies for reducing bovine bTB in cattle inEngland The Defra-commissioned FERA Report states: \\"Our modelling has shown that while the differences between the outcomes of strategies using culling and/or vaccinating badgers are quite modest (~15‚Äì40 CHBs prevented over 10 years), their risk profile is markedly different. Culling results in the known hazard of perturbation, leading to increased CHBs [Cattle Herd Breakdowns] in the periphery of the culling area. Culling also risks being ineffective or making the disease situation worse, if it is conducted partially (because of low compliance) or ineffectually (because of disruption or poor co-ordination) or it is stopped early (because of licensing issues). Vaccination carries no comparable risks or hazards.\\" The UK government claims that a sustained cull, conducted over a wide area in a co-ordinated and efficient manner, over a period of nine years, might achieve a 9‚Äì16% reduction in disease incidence. However, many scientists and a coalition of animal-welfare and conservation groups including the RSPCA, the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB, argue that a cull could risk local extermination of all badgers, and that a badger cull will not in any way solve the problem of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. The British Veterinary Association say that data collected from research in other countries, suggests that the control of the disease in farms has only been successfully carried out by dealing with both cattle and wild reservoirs of infection. However, in the introduction to the Final Report on the RBCT, the Chair of the Independent Scientific Group, John Bourne, states: \\"Scientific findings indicate that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone\\" (2007, Bovine TB: The Scientific Evidence. Final Report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB,3-289). In practice it is very difficult to quantify the contribution any wildlife reservoir has to the spread of bovine tuberculosis, since culling is usually carried out alongside cattle control measures (using \\"all the tools in the tool box\\" approach): \\"From Australian experience, Government has learnt that elimination of a wildlife host (feral Water Buffalo) needs to be followed by a long and extensive programme of cattle testing, slaughter, movement control and public awareness campaigns before bTB is eventually eradicated. And from New Zealand experience, population reduction of the wildlife host (possums) does not by itself reliably control bTB in cattle. In both Australia and New Zealand, Government was dealing with feral reservoirs of bTB rather than indigenous wildlife species, as is the case with the badger in this country\\" Wilsmore, A.J. and Taylor, N. M. (2005).Wilsmore, A.J. and Taylor, N. M. (2005). A review of the international evidence for an interrelationship between cattle and wildlife in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis. University of Reading/Defra John Bourne has also argued that the planned cull is likely only to increase the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, and that there should instead be much greater emphasis on cattle farming controls. He claims that \\"the cattle controls in operation at the moment are totally ineffective\\", partly because the tuberculin test used in cattle is not accurate, causing tests in herds to often show negative results even while still harbouring the disease. Referring to the group's final report, he further argues that whilst cattle can get tuberculosis from badgers, the true problem is the other way around: \\"Badger infections are following, not leading, TB infections in cattle\\". Overall, he says, the cull will only do more harm than good, because, \\"you just chase the badgers around, which makes TB worse\\". It is unclear what has been spent so far on planning and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying for and what the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: \\"You have got to be a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We are going to have a lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground.\\" He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers. Many cull opponents cite vaccination of badgers and cattle as a better alternative to culling. In Wales, where a policy of vaccination in 2013 was into its second year, Stephen James, who is the National Farmers Union Cymru's spokesperson on the matter, argues that the economics of badger culling are \\"ridiculous\\" saying the cost per badger was ¬£620. \\"That's a very expensive way of trying to control this disease when we know full well, from experience from other countries, that there are cheaper ways of doing it...if you vaccinate in the clean areas, around the edges of the endemic areas, then there's a better chance of it working.\\" The Badger Trust national charity, believes that vaccination will also be more likely to help eradicate the disease. Referring to further studies by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA),the group claims that vaccination reduces the risk of unvaccinated badger cubs testing tuberculosis positive, because \\"by the time cubs emerge and are available for vaccination they might have already been exposed [and are therefore resistant] to TB\\". Steve Clark, a director of the group, has separately said that \\"vaccination also reduces the bacilli that is excreted by infected badgers. It doesn't cure them, but it reduces the possibility of any further infection...in the region of a 75% level of protection. The life span of a badger is about five years. So if you continue the vaccination project for five years, then the majority of animals that were there at the beginning will have died out and that vaccination programme is leading towards a clean and healthy badger population.\\" According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead wildlife scientist for Defra and responsible for research on badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that a huge number of badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it is cheap and easy to exterminate animals in the early days of a cull it gets harder and more expensive as time goes on. A Defra-funded statistical analysis from 2013‚Äì2017 has shown reduced incidence of farms affected by bovine tuberculosis of 66% in Gloucestershire and 37% in Somerset. After two years of culling in Dorset, no change in incidence was observed. Proposed 2014/15 cull On 3 April 2014, Owen Paterson decided to continue the culling trials in 2014, in the same areas of Gloucestershire and Somerset as the 2012/13 cull. On 20 May 2014, the Badger Trust applied for a judicial review of this policy in the High Court, claiming that Mr Paterson unlawfully failed to put into place an independent expert panel to oversee the process.Farmers' Weekly, Vol 161 No. 18, 23 May 2014, p. 7. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the Humane Society International (HSI) UK, Defra said that for nearly a year, it had been conducting initial investigations into carbon monoxide gas dispersal in badger sett-like structures. No live badgers have been gassed. HSI expressed concerns about the extent to which gassing causes animal suffering. =The 2014/15 cull (England)= In September 2014, a second year of badger culling began in Gloucestershire and Somerset as during 2013/2014. It had previously been stated that the cull was to be extended to a further 10 areas. The Badger Trust claimed at the High Court that this cull would take place without independent monitoring, however, Defra has denied this saying experts from Natural England and the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency will be monitoring the cull. In June 2015, the National Trust, one of the largest landowners in the UK, stated it would not be allowing badger cullers onto their land until the results of all 4 years of pilot trials were known. Aims The 2014/15 cull targets had been lowered to 316 badgers in Somerset and 615 in Gloucestershire. Overall, the aim was for a reduction of 70% in badger populations over the successive culls. This was to be achieved with an emphasis on trapping badgers in cages and shooting them at dawn, rather than \\"free shooting\\". Protests As in the 2013/14 cull, hundreds of protesters entered the culling areas to disrupt the badgers causing them to remain down their setts and avoiding being trapped and/or shot, or to look for injured badgers. On 9 September 2014, two saboteurs in Gloucestershire found a badger trapped in a cage with cullers nearby. The police were called and the saboteurs pointed out that under government guidelines, trapped badgers should be released if there was a risk of interference from a third party. The sabateur organisation, \\"Stop the Cull\\" said police \\"did the right thing\\" and freed the badger. Gloucestershire police confirmed the standoff, which it said was resolved peacefully ‚Äì adding the decision to release the badger was made by a contractor working for the cull operator. Dr Brian May, guitarist with the rock band Queen is a critic of badger culling in the UK. He has called for the 2014/15 cull to be cancelled. \\"It's almost beyond belief that the government is blundering ahead with a second year of inept and barbaric badger killing,\\" he said. Organisations involved in protesting the cull include: * Team Badger: representing 25 different organisations * Gloucestershire Against the Badger Shooting (Gabs) Policing In the 2013/2014 cull, police from forces including Sussex, Warwickshire, Cornwall and the Metropolitan Police were brought in to help with policing, however, the police have said that in the 2014/2015 cull, there will be a focus on more community policing with local officers on patrol. \\"It will be very focussed on Gloucestershire officers dealing will local issues.\\" References Further reading * Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: The Government's Policy on Bovine TB and badger control in England, published 14 December 2011, retrieved 16 July 2012. * Food and Environment Research Agency: Vaccination Q&A;, retrieved 17 July 2012.

Some reservists are assigned to the same units they served in during their regular military service, and some are assigned to dedicated reserve units. Within the IDF's Manpower Directorate, the professional officer in charge of the reserve army is the chief reserve officer (abbreviated ◊ß◊û◊ú\\"◊®; \\"Kamlar\\"), an officer with the rank of Brigadier General. For many years, reserve service had been implemented under the \\"Defense Service Law\\",◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü [◊†◊ï◊°◊ó ◊û◊©◊ï◊ú◊ë], ◊î◊™◊©◊û\\"◊ï-1986 but since 1 August 2008 it has been implemented mainly under the \\"Reserve Service Law\\".◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ù, ◊î◊™◊©◊°\\"◊ó-2008 From 2004 onwards Israel has marked \\"Yom Miluim\\" ([National] Reserve Day) on the Lag BaOmer holiday to promote public sympathy for and appreciation of the soldiers serving in the reserve forces.  Mandatory reserve service in Israel  Israeli reservists returning to the Sinai peninsula from the front line following the Yom Kippur War, April 1974 Reserve service is mandatory in Israel, and is considered part of the national ethos. The actual percentage serving in the IDF reserves has significantly dwindled over the years, and nowadays consists mainly of soldiers who served in one of the IDF combat units during their initial compulsory service. All Israelis under the age of 40 who served in the IDF, unless otherwise exempt, are theoretically eligible for reserve duty. Women in non-combat positions are released from this obligation upon the birth of their first child. However, only those who completed at least 20 days of reserve service in the past three years are considered to be active reservists. In 2015, about 26% of the population eligible for reserve duty had an active reservist status.http://www.timesofisrael.com/just-a-quarter-of-all-eligible-reservists- serve-in-the-idf/ In the past, the age of exemption from reserve duty by the Defense Service Law (◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü [◊†◊ï◊°◊ó ◊û◊©◊ï◊ú◊ë], ◊î◊™◊©◊û\\"◊ï-1986) was 54 for men and 38 for women; nevertheless, it was not possible to call up reservists over 41 years of age who had served in a combat unit in the last 10 years or more, or reserve soldiers over the age of 48 who had served in a combat unit for at least 20 years, unless they gave consent for this to happen. Over the years, the IDF has lowered the maximum age at which male reservists are called for reserve duty service, so that the earliest age of exemption for males has become 40 for regular soldiers, 42 for combat officers, 45 for non-combat officers, 48 for soldiers serving in the Regional Defense units (◊î◊í◊û\\"◊®) and in non-military reservist units, and 51 years-of-age for the reservists serving as physicians in their reserve duty. In 2008 the Knesset approved the Reserve Service Law (◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊î◊û◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ù, ◊î◊™◊©◊°\\"◊ó-2008) which came into effect on 1 August 2008. Accordingly, the age of exemption from reserve duty was reduced for all males, and as a result, ever since then it has stood at 40 for all soldiers, 45 for officers, and 49 for reservists who perform certain specific duties defined as such by the Minister of Defense and approved by the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (this mostly includes officials in the medical branch, drivers of heavy equipment, mechanics and technicians). Although still available for call-up in times of crisis, most men and virtually all women are not called up for reserve duty in any given year, as units do not always call up their reservists every year, and a variety of exemptions are available for regular reserve service, though virtually no exemptions exist for reserve duty in a time of crisis. The quota of the total reserve days per soldier is also determined in the Defense Service Law, and is defined as being 36 days per year, which the Israeli Minister of Defense has the authority to extend by a further seven days if necessary (and in special cases which are also defined in the law they might extend this period yet further for reservists who hold specific jobs and professions). The IDF calls its reservists for duty through a special call-up letter (◊¶◊ï ◊ß◊®◊ô◊ê◊î) containing details of the reserve duty they are obliged to undertake, including the relevant dates and location. In cases where these dates might conflict with the work or school schedule of the reservist, they are allowed to appeal to the Reserve Coordination Committee (◊ï◊ú◊™\\"◊ù) who may grant a change to a more convenient time. In addition to calling up candidates for reserve duty involving training, preparation, and operational employment, the IDF might also call up reservists for duty in circumstances of emergency, via a special immediate order called \\"Decree 8\\" (◊¶◊ï 8). Since 2001 reserve duty is also performed in the Israel Border Police units. Reserve service also applies for units of the Office of the Prime Minister, such as the Shin Bet and the Mossad. Until the mid-1990s female reservists were very rare in the IDF. Nevertheless, with the opening of many military professions to women, many female soldiers were required to agree to take part in reserve duty after they finish their initial mandatory service in the military as a condition for joining certain positions in the IDF. Women serve until fully exempt from service at age 40, regardless of marital status. Pregnant women, or those with children are given immediate exemption from service, unless they serve in combat roles.  The reserve duty in the Israeli ethos and in Israeli popular culture  In the first four decades following the establishment of the State of Israel, a large part of the Israeli population served in the IDF reserves, and the amount of reserve duty given to each one was relatively high (in most instances one month per year, and sometimes even up to two months per year). As a result, a rich folklore developed surrounding the Israeli reserve service in which the IDF reservist was portrayed as a kind soldier, a little lazy, but with a sense of humour, ingenuity and resourcefulness, who served his country from ideological motives. = Film and television = One of the most prominent Israeli films depicting the reserve service experience is Assi Dayan's 1976 cult comedy Giv'at Halfon Eina Ona. The film depicts the comic situations resulting from the encounter between the reservists' everyday civilian life, and the rigid world of the military. In the mid-2000s the TV series Miluim depicted the experiences of the members of a reserve unit called up for service, taking the viewer through their training, strategy, teamwork, and different missions. = The reserve duty in Israeli humour = A notable feature of Israeli songs dealing with the reserve duty experience is the deeply humorous tone intertwined in describing this way of life. One of the most famous of these songs is \\"Pgisha BaMiluim\\" (◊§◊í◊ô◊©◊î ◊ë◊û◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ê◊ô◊ù) by Israeli pop group The High Windows, which gained massive and immediate popularity in Israel upon its release in the 1960s. The prominent Israeli comedy group HaGashash HaHiver also had various skits which focused on the experience of reserve duty in the IDF. One of the most famous of these, \\"The Drafted Vehicle\\", portrayed the experiences of three IDF reservists after the Six-Day War, who are in charge of stowing various cars commandeered by the military during the war. Other such famous sketches include \\"Cooks Discourse\\", in which two veteran reservist cooks meet and reminisce about the period of the establishment of the State of Israel, together with a non-reserve IDF soldier; and \\"Pagaz Compote\\" in which a reservist seeks to be exempted from his upcoming duty because he is getting married.

Most commonly it is found in the Ebola virus (EBOV), a type of non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus. Ebola virus causes a severe and often fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans, known as Ebola virus disease. The virus matrix protein VP40 is a major structural protein that plays a central role in virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane of infected cells. VP40 proteins work by associating with cellular membranes, interacting with the cytoplasmic tails of glycoproteins and binding to the ribonucleoprotein complex. Structure The VP40 monomer consists of two protein domains, the N-terminal oligomerization domain and the C-terminal membrane-binding domain, connected by a flexible linker. Both the N- and C-terminal domains fold into beta sandwich structures of similar topology. Within the N-terminal domain are two overlapping L-domains with the sequences PTAP and PPEY at residues 7 to 13, which are required for efficient budding. L-domains are thought to mediate their function in budding through their interaction with specific host cellular proteins, such as TSG101 and vps-4. Function Different structures VP40 assumes in its functional roles VP40 coordinates numerous functions in the viral life cycle of the Ebola virus. These include: regulation of viral transcription, morphogenesis, packaging and budding of mature virions. VP40 goes through intermediate states of assembly (e.g. octamers). It has been noted that proteins encoded by EBOV (VP30, VP35, and VP40) act independently as suppressors of RNA silencing, indicating that the virus actively resists cellular RNAi during replication. Significance of VP40 VP40 position in the Ebola virus genome Study of the matrix protein VP40 is important due to the high mortality rate of the Ebola virus, which is listed as a WHO Risk Group 4 Pathogen, an HHS Select Agent, an NIH/NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen, a CDC Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group. Expression of the matrix protein VP40 is sufficient to generate virus-like particles (no viral genetic material) in a mammalian host that are remarkably indistinguishable from live virus, from a morphological standpoint. =West African Ebola virus outbreak= During and after the 2014-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic treatment options were sought; among them were the VP40 matrix protein as a target for possible research that may (or may not) lead to a therapeutic option.subscription needed References Viral structural proteins West African Ebola virus epidemic ","title":"VP40"},{"id":"36472037","text":"In molecular biology mir-444 microRNA is a short RNA molecule.

Pins with coloured glass heads for positioning insects on mounting boards not for direct pinning. Entomological pins Though there is no international authority mandating standards for the collection and preservation of specimens of insects and similar invertebrates, entomology has been an amateur and scientific activity for over two centuries. During this period practices varied widely and in many respects commonly differed greatly from modern practice.Browne, Montagu. Practical Taxidermy. 2nd ed. (undated after 1896) London: L. Upcott Gill However, by the mid- twentieth century a range of technique and of equipment had emerged that amount to a de facto standard.Smart, John. British Museum (Natural History). Instructions for Collectors 4A. Insects. London 1963Ward's Natural Science Establishment. How to make an insect collection. Pub: Rochester, N.Y., Ward's natural science establishment, 1945. Although there is some flexibility concerning the details, practitioners who diverge too widely from that standard are likely to find their work ignored as unacceptable anywhere in the modern world. One beneficial effect of the standard is that equipment and supplies have become available for practically any aspect of collection, preservation and documentation of specimens. The best-known format for insect collection is dry mounting and labelling on pins, and for many types of specimen this is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Pinning is a range of techniques for which the equipment has changed only slightly in recent decades but it is not the only one of importance in entomology. Other means of mounting include: * various kinds of slides for microscopes and projectors; * inflation of caterpillars for drying; * freeze-drying of specimens with labile coloration; and * wet preservation of several types. Research into improved methods of presentation and handling continues, each requiring its own equipment. Pinning of entomological specimens Directly- pinned Diptera. Though most of these specimens are at the correct height, some have been pinned incorrectly by placing the pin on the centre line, damaging characters on both sides of the thorax. Setting boards *Entomological pins. Continental pins, so called for historical reasons, are used internationally by museums and collectors. They are made of stainless steel for preference, especially for very long-term storage of specimens, but blackened steel also is used. The pins have round plastic or solid metal heads. Continental pins are of a standard length (40mm), but they are available in thicknesses numbered 000 (the thinnest), 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (the thickest). This standard pin length is sufficient to accommodate an adequate number of data labels and to permit convenient handling with suitably curved forceps. As an exception to this standard, there also are pins of size 7, extra-long and very strong pins for very large beetles; they are 52mm long and thicker than size 6 pins. *Direct Pinning. Direct pinning is the insertion of an entomological pin directly through the thorax of a specimen. The insects are pinned vertically through the thorax with a suitably sized pin, but by convention they are not pinned on the midline, but to the right, so as to leave at least one side undamaged. *Point. A point is a triangular piece of white card. Specially designed point punches permit the production of large numbers of points of standard sizes as required. To use a point, insert a pin is inserted through the broad base of the triangle. To mount the specimen, place a tiny amount of glue on the tip and apply it to the right side of the insects thorax. If appropriate the tip of the point may be bent at the necessary angle to hold the body of the specimen horizontal when the pin is vertical, with the long axis of the insect at right angles to the point. Sciapus nervosus glued to a card point Diptera mounted on card points *Minuten pins. Insect pins without heads, 12mm long. They are used for double mounting (staging) very small insects. They also may be used profitably for staging insects of moderate size, where they have the advantage of being less damaging to the specimen. For best effect in that respect, the pin is inserted from below through the staging card, well into the thorax, but not all the way through. Alternatively the minuten pin can be inserted laterally into one side of the thorax, again preferably not all the way through. A hoverfly on a staged minuten pin *Carding. Insects (especially Coleoptera and Hemiptera) are glued to rectangular pieces of acid free card or Bristol board providing a stage. Typical sizes are 4.5 x 11 mm;5 x 14 mm;6 x 17 mm;10 x 21 mm;13 x 30 mm. Printed lines allow uniform placement of the entomological pin. Though this is convenient, it is dubious practice at best, because it obscures features that might be necessary for taxonomic or morphological studies. In any case, at the very least the glue should be sufficiently conveniently soluble to be removed with solvents when necessary. With such considerations in mind, Canada balsam is about as good an adhesive as any. A carded bug *Staging. When specimens are mounted on a smaller support which in turn is supported on a normal full-sized entomological pin, this is called staging. For example a specimen might be mounted on a minuten pin, typically being pinned on its side (lateral pinning) or upright (direct pinning) with the minuten pin driven into a stage, a strip of suitable material such as dried plant pith or plastic foam supported in a horizontal position on the main entomological pin; as a rule a number 3 pin is convenient. Other forms of stage include card mounts and point mounts. :The stage usually is positioned at such a distance up the vertical stage-pin, as to put the specimen at the same height as a directly pinned insect; this normally allows room for labels beneath and to allow handling of the specimen without damage. :If insects are side-pinned by pins that pass right through the specimens, then the minuten should be at such an angle that different features are damaged on the opposite sides of the thorax. Competent staging protects small specimens and displays most features conveniently. The stage- pin then is easy to manipulate when moving the specimen and the stage absorbs vibrations.

He argues that there are many competing forces working within America that are causing the financial crisis, elite crisis, media crisis, and, what he sees as the most ominous problem facing the globe, the environmental global warming crisis. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"forcefully written\\" and \\"provocative\\". Aaron Swartz described the book as \\"compellingly readable, impossibly erudite, and‚Äîmost stunningly of all‚Äîcorrect\\". The book has been reviewed by sources such as The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Slate. Main arguments * The book argues that the concept of and movement towards meritocracy which initially stemmed from a desire to subvert and democratize the East Coast WASP aristocracy resulted in a widening of the pool eligible to become elites but ultimately reproduced widespread inequality and corruption. That corruption, continues the author, has led to a record increase in the distrust of American institutions both public and private and to the rise of a class of \\"insurrectionist\\" commentators and activists such as the Tea Party movement and Occupy Wall Street. The author also reviews various scandals which he believes heightened the distrust: Enron, the unveiling of rampant sexual abuse by Catholic priests, the misguided consensus among media and political elites that Iraq harbored weapons of mass destruction, among others. * The author notes that the concept of \\"meritocracy\\" was long a rare uniting value held by both the Left and the Right in the United States and even Europe. * Thanks to the meritocracy, test scores have become the key to one's entrance into the ranks of ruling and governing elites but the rise of the test tutoring industry has reproduced old patterns of inequality because, among other factors, few African-Americans are able to afford the fees of test prep courses. The result has been disproportionately low admission of African-Americans at schools such as the quintessentially meritocratic Hunter College High School where admission is based solely on test scores. * The book analyzes the meaning of the word \\"elite\\" and analyzes its composition and values. The author argues that in today's society power is not just conveyed by wealth but also by platform and network. * Hayes expounds the concept of \\"fractal inequality\\" defined as the insecurity which haunts elites of not belonging to even more elite circles from which they are excluded. He credits the insecurity caused by fractal inequality, coupled with what he calls \\"the cult of smartness\\" for rampant institutional corruption. * The book concludes with an exploration of the rise of leaderless organizations such as Occupy Wall Street.

The battle was a major victory for the Byzantines, and contributed to the demise of Hamdanid military power, which in the early 950s had proven a great challenge to Byzantium. Background In the period from 945 to 967, the Hamdanid Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, was the Byzantines' most persistent opponent on their eastern frontier, by virtue of his control over most of the Byzantine‚ÄìMuslim borderlands (Thughur) and his commitment to jihad.; . Sayf al-Dawla had already campaigned against the Byzantines in 938 and 940, but it was after his establishment of a large domain centred on Aleppo in 945, that he began confronting them on an annual basis... Despite the numerical advantages enjoyed by the Byzantines,. the Hamdanid's emergence blunted a Byzantine offensive that had been unfolding since the mid-920s and had already resulted in the fall of Malatya (934), Arsamosata (940), and Qaliqala (in 949).. His main enemy during the first decade of continuous conflict with the Byzantines was the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas. After a few initial failures, Sayf al-Dawla quickly established his supremacy: in 953, he heavily defeated Bardas near Marash. Expeditions led by Bardas in the next two years were also defeated, allowing Sayf al-Dawla to refortify his frontier zone and strengthen it against further Byzantine attacks.. Using his light cavalry to evade the more slow-moving Byzantines, Sayf al-Dawla was also able to launch destructive raids deep into Byzantine territory; however, his raids avoided fortified positions, and he could not challenge effective Byzantine control over their recent conquests.. After 955, however, the situation began to change: the ineffective Bardas Phokas was dismissed and replaced by his more capable son, Nikephoros, under whose supervision the Byzantine army's equipment was upgraded, its ranks filled with Armenians, and its training intensified. The new Byzantine leadership, which included Nikephoros's brother Leo and his nephew John Tzimiskes, resolved on a forward strategy and began raiding deep into Hamdanid territory. Tzimiskes's raids and the battle of Raban In spring 956, Sayf al-Dawla pre-empted Tzimiskes from a planned assault on Amida in the Jazira, and invaded Byzantine territory first. Tzimiskes then seized a pass in Sayf al-Dawla's rear, and attacked him during his return. The hard-fought battle, fought amidst torrential rainfall, resulted in a Muslim victory as Tzimiskes lost 4,000 men. At the same time, however, Leo Phokas invaded Syria and defeated and captured Sayf al-Dawla's cousin, whom he had left behind in his stead. In 957, Nikephoros took and razed the fortress of Hadath, and in the next spring, Tzimiskes invaded the Jazira.. There, he captured the fortress of Dara, and scored a crushing victory near Amida over an army led by one of Sayf al-Dawla's favourite lieutenants, the Circassian Nadja. Of Nadja's 10,000 troops, Tzimiskes reportedly killed half and captured more than half of the survivors.. Reinforced with more troops under the parakoimomenos Basil Lekapenos, in June, Tzimiskes then stormed Samosata and the fortress of Raban south of Hadath. It was there that Sayf al-Dawla himself came to confront him. The ensuing battle (taking place between 18 October and 15 November 958) was hard fought‚ÄîSayf al- Dawla's cousin and court poet Abu Firas is said to have broken two lances in his first charge‚Äîbut in the end, the Byzantines prevailed and the Muslim army broke and fled. Many of Sayf al-Dawla's court companions and ghilman fell in the pursuit, while over 1,700 of his cavalry were captured and paraded in the streets of Constantinople. Aftermath The victory at Raban made clear that the Byzantines were gaining the upper hand over the Hamdanids. Their success also enabled them to retain control of Samosata, meaning that they had broken through the fortified frontier zone protecting northern Syria. Nevertheless, the Hamdanid ruler was still in control of a potent military and capable of launching raids into Byzantine territory, until he suffered a catastrophic defeat in November 960 at the hands of Leo Phokas. Thereafter, Hamdanid military power was broken, Cilicia was annexed by the Byzantines in 964‚Äì965, and even Aleppo itself was captured briefly by the Byzantines in 962.; .

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote their products for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and corporations that market drugs for off-label indications may be subject to civil liability under the False Claims Act as well as criminal penalties. Off-label promotion settlements under the False Claims Act Descriptions of the lawsuits are listed in chronological order. = Parke-Davis, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer: Off-label promotion of Neurontin, May 2004 = In 1996, whistleblower David Franklin left his position as a medical liaison with Parke-Davis, a pharmaceutical division of Warner-Lambert Company, after learning of the company's marketing strategy to promote the epilepsy drug Neurontin for uses not approved by the FDA. Franklin and his attorney, Thomas M. Greene, filed a lawsuit, Franklin v. Parke-Davis, under the False Claims Act in federal district court in Boston. In the first off-label promotion case ever litigated in a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act, the settlement was announced after eight years of litigation in May 2004. Warner-Lambert agreed to pay $430 million to resolve all civil and criminal liability, with $24.64 million going to Franklin for his participation in the lawsuit. To date, it is one of the largest recoveries against a pharmaceutical company in U.S. history. The total settlement remains the largest against a pharmaceutical company in a non-intervened False Claims Act case, but a July 2017 settlement against Celgene Corporation exceeds it, as the civil settlement in that case was $280 million while the civil component of the Parke-Davis case settled for $190 million.List of largest civil only pharmaceutical settlements = Serono: Off-label promotion of Serostim, October 2005 = Serono, a Swiss biotechnology company, obtained approval from the FDA for the drug Serostim in 1996 to treat AIDS wasting, a condition in which AIDS patients experience rapid weight loss. However, around the same time, the advent of more robust protease inhibitors that could interact in AIDS cocktails to markedly slow the advancement of the syndrome led to a decline in symptoms of AIDS wasting and, consequently, demand for Serostim. As a result, according to prosecutors, Serono devised a marketing scheme by which the definition of AIDS wasting would be changed to measure a loss in \\"body cell mass.\\" The company then created a computerized medical test designed to detect loss of body cell mass and thereby diagnose AIDS wasting even in patients who had not experienced any weight loss. Serono ultimately agreed to pay $704 million to resolve all civil and criminal liability. Five whistleblowers, all former employees of Serono, initiated complaints under the False Claims Act, ultimately leading to the government's investigation. The whistleblowers shared in a $51 million reward from the settlement. = Schering-Plough: Off-label promotion of Intron A and Temodar, August 2006 = Schering-Plough pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make false statements to the Medicaid program in connection with the pricing of its allergy drug Claritin. Allegations of off-label promotion, however, centered on the off-label promotion of several cancer drugs. The drug Temodar, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999 for treatment of a specific type of brain tumor, was allegedly being promoted as a treatment for other types of brain cancer for which it had not been approved. Schering- Plough allegedly promoted Intron A, meanwhile, for use in superficial bladder cancer and hepatitis C. The case arose from claims filed under the False Claims Act; the company was forced to pay a $180 million criminal fine and an additional $255 million to settle all civil claims. = InterMune: Off-label promotion of Actimmune, October 2006 = In 2007, InterMune abandoned all efforts to develop the drug Actimmune, which goes by the generic name of Interferon-gamma, as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic lung condition, after experimental trials showed the drug was ineffective at treating the disease. The decision was announced after the company agreed to pay $36.9 million to resolve criminal charges and civil liability in connection with InterMune's off-label promotion of the drug, which had only been approved by the FDA to treat chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis, both extremely rare illnesses which would have generated sales of only $20 million a year. Sales of the drug to treat IPF, however, soared as high as $141 million in the year 2003. InterMune's yearly sales were entirely from Actimmune. = Cell Therapeutics: Off-label promotion of Trisenox, April 2007 = In a qui tam suit filed under the False Claims Act by whistleblower James Marchese, Cell Therapeutics agreed to settle claims for $10.5 million that it illegally promoted the cancer drug Trisenox. Trisenox won approval by the FDA in 2000 to treat a relatively rare form of leukemia known as acute promyelocytic leukemia, but the manufacturer promoted Trisenox as effective treatment for other cancers for which the drug was not approved. = Medicis Pharmaceutical: Off-label promotion of Loprox, May 2007 = This settlement of $9.8 million resolved allegations that Medicis Pharmaceutical promoted Loprox, a topical skin preparation, for use on children under the age of 10 despite the fact that use in children under 10 had not been approved by the FDA. According to the government and the whistleblower complaint filed by four former Medicis sales representatives under the False Claims Act, pediatricians were urged to prescribe Loprox as a treatment for diaper rash. The four relators shared a $1,078,000 reward for providing information in the lawsuit. = Orphan Medical and Jazz Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Xyrem, July 2007 = Orphan Medical, a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, pleaded guilty to felony misbranding under the FDCA and agreed to pay $20 million to resolve all civil claims and criminal charges in connection with Xyrem, a drug approved by the FDA for narcolepsy and the street version of which is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule I drug. Although the drug's distribution as a narcolepsy medication is strictly regulated, the complaint filed under the False Claims Act alleged that the company promoted the drug as a treatment for depression, insomnia, and fibromyalgia. This case was later overturned as the drug was found to be effective for insomnia and fibromyalgia. In 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals further expanded First Amendment commercial speech protection in the realm of pharmaceutical marketing in United States v. Caronia. The court overturned a pharmaceutical sales representative‚Äôs conviction arising from a recording of his promotion of off-label use of Xyrem (sodium oxybate) to a group of doctors. Xyrem was approved for the indication of excessive daytime sleepiness, but Caronia promoted it for insomnia and fibromyalgia. The court held that convicting the sales representative for off-label marketing that was not untruthful or misleading violated his First Amendment rights. In contrast, off-label promotion that is untruthful and misleading would be fraudulent, and thus not protected by the First Amendment.http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/07/19/fda- sanctions-off-label-drug-promotion/ = Bristol-Myers Squibb and Otsuka American: Off-label promotion of Abilify, September 2007 = In a settlement totaling $515 million to settle a host of civil charges and civil liabilities related to alleged illegal pricing and marketing practices for several of its drugs, Bristol-Myers Squibb paid out approximately $50 million to settle seven qui tam suits filed under the False Claims Act. Specifically, the company engaged in off-label promotion of Abilify, an antipsychotic drug approved by the FDA to treat adult schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. The government alleged that Bristol promoted the drug for pediatric use and to treat dementia, both of which are off-label uses. = Cephalon: Off-label promotion of Actiq, Gabitril and Provigil, September 2008 = Cephalon, a Pennsylvania- based drug company, paid out $425 million, $50 million of which was paid to resolve a criminal indictment for violations of the FDCA, and $375 million to dispose of claims brought under the False Claims Act. Four qui tam relators who filed suits collectively recovered $46,469,978 as their share. The FDA approved Actiq, a fentanyl product manufactured as a lollipop, for use in cancer patients for whom morphine-based painkillers are no longer effective. According to the government, Cephalon promoted Actiq for use in non-cancer patients to treat such conditions as migraines, sickle-cell pain crises, and other injuries. Gabitril, meanwhile, received FDA approval as a treatment for partial seizures, but the manufacturer allegedly marketed the drug for anxiety, insomnia, and pain. Provigil was initially approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from narcolepsy, and later approved the drug for further label indications. Cephalon allegedly promoted Provigil for a five-year period as a non-stimulant drug for the treatment of sleepiness, tiredness, decreased activity, lack of energy, and fatigue. = Eli Lilly: Off-label promotion of Zyprexa, January 2009 = After four whistleblowers initially filed suits under the False Claims Act, prompting a government investigation, Eli Lilly and Company agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Specifically, the private whistleblower complaints and the government alleged that Eli Lilly engaged in a marketing scheme over a period of several years to promote the drug's use in children and the elderly, groups particularly vulnerable to the product's side effects. An antipsychotic drug initially approved in 2000 to treat manifestations of certain psychotic disorders, the government's indictment contended that Eli Lilly deliberately marketed the drug to treat agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder, none of which were uses approved by the FDA. = Pfizer: Off-label promotion of Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox and Lyrica, September 2009 = In what was the largest pharmaceutical settlement in U.S. history at the time, Pfizer reached a $2.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve criminal charges and civil claims under the False Claims Act. The pharmaceutical giant was accused of off-label promotion of the anti-inflammatory drug Bextra; Geodon, an anti- psychotic drug; Zyvox, an antibiotic; and Lyrica, an anti-epileptic drug. The drugs were allegedly promoted for uses not approved by the FDA, and therefore the company's marketing caused non-reimbursable prescriptions to be paid by Medicare and Medicaid (Medicare and Medicaid do not reimburse for off-label drug prescriptions). Six whistleblowers shared a $102 million reward under the False Claims Act. = Alpharma: Off-label promotion of Kadian, March 2010 = After a government investigation precipitated by a whistleblower suit filed by Debra Parks under the False Claims Act in 2006, Alpharma agreed to a $42.5 million settlement to resolve all civil and criminal liability in connection with the company's alleged off-label marketing of Kadian. According to the government, the company promoted Kadian, a morphine-based drug, for uses unapproved by the FDA. In addition, the company made misrepresentations about the safety and efficacy of the drug. = AstraZeneca: Off-label promotion of Seroquel, April 2010 = A qui tam suit filed under the False Claims Act led AstraZeneca to make a massive $520 million settlement to resolve all civil and criminal liability with respect to illegal promotion of the anti-psychotic drug Seroquel. Approved by the FDA in 1997 to treat manifestations of psychotic disorders, in 2000 the FDA subsequently approved Seroquel for short- term treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and bipolar depression. Between January 2001 through December 2006, AstraZeneca promoted Seroquel to psychiatrists and other physicians for certain uses that were not approved by the FDA, including aggression, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, anger management, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar maintenance, dementia, depression, mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sleeplessness. Federal health programs do not reimburse for prescriptions prescribed for indications not approved by the FDA. = Ortho-McNeil-Janssen: Off-label promotion of Topamax, May 2010 = Two subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical and Ortho-McNeil-Janssen, agreed to pay more than $81 million to settle all civil and criminal liability as a result of the companies‚Äô illegal marketing of Topamax, an anti-epileptic drug. As part of the settlement, Ortho-McNeil agreed to plead guilty to one count of a misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The criminal fine amounted to $6.1 million, and the government recovered $75 million in damages under the False Claims Act. The whisteblowers who filed suit under the False Claims Act stood to recover, collectively, more than $9 million. = Novartis: Off-label promotion of Tobi, May 2010 = Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation agreed to pay $72.5 million to settle claims brought under the False Claims Act alleging off-label promotion of the cystic fibrosis drug Tobi between 2001 and 2006. = Allergan: Off-label promotion of Botox, September 2010 = Allergan, the manufacturer of Botox, agreed to a $600 million settlement to resolve all civil and criminal liability surrounding the promotion of Botox for treatment of chronic migraines before FDA review or approval of the drug for such use. = Novartis: Off-label promotion of Trileptal, September 2010 = Novartis made a settlement of $422.5 million, including a $185 million criminal fine and forfeiture for the off-label promotion of the anti-epilepsy drug Trileptal. Trileptal was approved by the FDA to treat partial seizures, but was allegedly promoted to treat pain and some psychiatric conditions. The government also accused Novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to healthcare providers. = Forest Laboratories: Off-label promotion of Levothroid, Celexa and Lexapro, September 2010 = Forest Laboratories made a settlement of more than $313 million to resolve all criminal and civil liability related to three different drugs. Forest Laboratories pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and illegal distribution of Levothroid, which at the time was an unapproved new drug. The settlement also resolved allegations of off-label marketing of Celexa, an antidepressant approved to treat adult depression. According to the government, Forest marketed Celexa for use in children and adolescents. = √âlan: Off-label promotion of Zonegran, December 2010 = Irish pharmaceutical company √âlan and its U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay $203 million to resolve allegations that the company engaged in off-label promotion of the anti- epilepsy drug Zonegran. Eisai, a Japanese drug marketer that purchased the drug from √âlan, agreed to pay $11 million. The settlement resolved claims of illegal promotion under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as well as civil claims filed under the False Claims Act. = Kos Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Advicor and Niaspan, December 2010 = Kos Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, agreed to a settlement of more than $41 million to dispose of all civil and criminal liability resulting from the company's off-label promotion and illegal payment of kickbacks in the marketing of Advicor and Niaspan. The Department of Justice entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Kos based on actions taken by the company to conduct internal investigations and its ongoing cooperation with the government. = UCB: Off-label promotion of Keppra, June 2011 = The U.S. subsidiary of UCB, a Belgian pharmaceutical company, agreed to pay more than $34 million as part of a settlement agreement to resolve all criminal and civil liability arising from its alleged off-label promotion of the epilepsy drug Keppra. UCB was alleged to have promoted the drug for the treatment of migraine headaches, a use for which Keppra had not received FDA approval. = Novo Nordisk: Off-label promotion of NovoSeven, June 2011 = Novo Nordisk, a Danish drug manufacturer, agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve allegations of illegal promotion of the drug NovoSeven, approved by the FDA to treat certain bleeding disorders in hemophiliacs. The government‚Äôs complaint alleged numerous off-label uses for which the company promoted the drug, including as a coagulatory agent for trauma patients, general surgery, cardiac surgery, liver surgery, liver transplants and intra-cerebral hemorrhage. = Pfizer: Off-label promotion of Detrol, October 2011 = As was the case in the 2004 Pfizer settlement over off-label promotion of Neurontin, in 2011 Pfizer agreed to a settlement as a result of a whistleblower complaint filed under the False Claims Act without intervention by the Department of Justice. The $14.5 million settlement arose from a complaint which alleged that Pfizer was engaging in the illegal promotion of Detrol, a drug approved by the FDA to treat urinary incontinence, for off-label uses. = Abbott Laboratories: Off- label promotion of Depakote, May 2012 = Abbott Laboratories agreed to pay $800 million to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from the company‚Äôs unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the FDA. The company misbranded Depakote by promoting the drug to control agitation and aggression in elderly dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was FDA approved. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off-label promotion. = GlaxoSmithKline: Off-label promotion of Paxil, Wellbutrin, Advair, Lamictal and Zofran, July 2012 = GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) agreed to pay $1.043 billion relating to false claims arising from off- label promotion. GSK promoted the drugs Paxil and Wellbutrin for unapproved, non-covered uses. GSK also promoted its asthma drug, Advair, for first-line therapy for mild asthma patients even though it was not approved or medically appropriate under these circumstances. GSK also promoted Advair for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with misleading claims as to the relevant treatment guidelines. GSK also promoted Lamictal, an anti-epileptic medication, for off-label, non-covered psychiatric uses, neuropathic pain and pain management. Further, GSK promoted certain forms of Zofran, approved only for post-operative nausea, for the treatment of morning sickness in pregnant women. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off-label promotion. = Amgen: Off-label promotion of Aranesp, Enbrel and Neulasta, December 2012 = Amgen agreed to pay $612 million for the off-label promotion of three drugs it manufactured, Enbrel and Neulasta. Amgen promoted the sale and use of Aranesp for dosing regiments and indications which were (a) not approved by the FDA, and (b) not medically accepted indications, including anemia caused by cancer, anemia caused by chronic disease, chronic anemia, and anemia caused by myelodysplastic syndrome. Similarly, Amgen promoted its drugs Enbrel and Neulasta for off- label indications that were not eligible for coverage by federal health care programs. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off-label promotion. = Par Pharmaceutical: Off-label promotion of Megace ES, March 2013 = Par Pharmaceutical agreed to pay $22.5 million to the federal government and various states to resolve claims arising from its off-label marketing. Par made unsubstantiated and misleading representations about the superiority of Megace ES over generic megestrol acetate for elderly patients to encourage providers to switch patients from generic megestrol acetate to Megace ES, despite having conducted no well-controlled studies to support a claim of greater efficacy for Megace ES. Except as admitted in the plea agreement, the claims settled by the civil settlement agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability as to those claims. = Wyeth Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Rapamune, July 2013 = Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, agreed to pay $257.4 million to resolve claims involving off-label promotion of the immunosuppressant drug Rapamune. The government alleged that Wyeth violated the False Claims Act, from 1998 through 2009, by promoting Rapamune for unapproved uses, some of which were not medically accepted indications and, therefore, were not covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. These unapproved uses included non-renal transplants, conversion use (switching a patient from another immunosuppressant to Rapamune) and using Rapamune in combination with other immunosuppressive agents not listed on the label. = Johnson & Johnson: Off-label promotion of Risperdal, Invega and Natrecor, November 2013 = Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $1.391 billion to resolve false claims resulting from its off-label promotion of Risperdal, Invega and Natrecor. Risperdal was approved only to treat schizophrenia, yet Janssen, a Johnson and Johnson (J&J;) subsidiary, promoted Risperdal to physicians and other prescribers who treated elderly dementia patients by urging the prescribers to use Risperdal to treat symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, depression, hostility and confusion. Similarly, although Invega was approved only for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, from 2006 through 2009, J&J; and Janssen marketed the drug for off-label indications. Finally, Scios Inc,. a subsidiary of J&J;, launched an aggressive campaign to market Natrecor for scheduled, serial outpatient infusions for patients with less severe heart failure ‚Äì a use not included in the FDA-approved label and not covered by federal health care programs. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off-label promotion. = CareFusion: Off-label promotion of ChloraPrep, January 2014 = CareFusion agreed to pay $40.1 million to resolve allegations of off-label promotion of ChloraPrep. ChloraPrep had been approved by the FDA for the preparation of a patient‚Äôs skin prior to surgery or injection. This settlement also resolves allegations that, during the period between September 2009 and August 2011, CareFusion knowingly promoted the sale of ChloraPrep for uses that were not approved by the FDA, some of which were not medically accepted indications, and made unsubstantiated representations about the appropriate uses of ChloraPrep. This settlement figure represents resolution of other claims in addition to off- label promotion. = Endo Pharmaceuticals: Off-label promotion of Lidoderm, February 2014 = Endo Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay $171.9 million to resolve civil liability under the False Claims Act for its off-label promotion of Lidoderm. The government charged that, between 2002 and 2006, Endo misbranded Lidoderm and introduced it into interstate commerce in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Lidoderm's labeling lacked adequate directions for use in the treatment of non-PHN related pain, including low back pain, diabetic neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome. These uses were intended by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. but never approved by the FDA. = Insys Therapeutics: Off-label promotion of Opioid drug Subsys, August 2015 = In August 2015, Insys Therapeutics reached a $1.1 million settlement with the Oregon Department of Justice, resolving allegations that it promoted its opioid drug Subsys to treat off-label non-cancer uses that were not approved by the FDA.http://www.doj.state.or.us/releases/Pages/2015/rel080515.aspx Insys has also paid New Hampshire $2.9 million to settle allegations of aggressive marketing of Subsys.http://www.businessinsider.com/opioid-crisis-and-insys- therapeutics-fentanyl-spray-2017-4 = Acclarent Inc.: Off-label promotion of Sinus Spacer Product, July 2016 = On July 22, 2016, California-based medical device manufacturer and Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Acclarent Inc. agreed to pay $18 million to resolve allegations that it marketed and distributed its sinus spacer product for use as a drug delivery device without FDA approval.https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/johnson-johnson-subsidiary-acclarent- inc-pays-government-18-million-settle-false-claims-act The government alleged that it continued its off-label marketing even after the FDA rejected the company's request to expand the approved uses, and even though the company added a warning to its label regarding the use of active drug substances in the device.

Early years Francisco Antonio Jose Felix Sarracino was born of 21 February 1790 at Pajarito pueblo, son of Jose Rafael Sarracino and Maria Luisa Bartola Gutierrez. He was a descendant of Don Pedro Dur√°n Y Ch√°ves. Governor of New Mexico Sarracino was appointed governor of New Mexico from 1833 to 1835. He was the first governor to use the printing press in New Mexico, in 1834. This was the same press that Father Martinez of Taos used to publish the Cuaderno de Ortografia. In 1834 Sarracino published a decree in which he took up the cause of the poor people who had to serve in the militia at their own expense, contributing their own horses, equipment and provisions for up to three months in the field. He said these pobres faced ruin \\"if we continue in this inaction which offers dishonorable testimony to our foolishness and indifference,\\" saying that they fought \\"without enthusiasm or zeal\\", only because they were obliged to fight. During his tenure, in October 1834 Juan Rafael Ortiz acted as governor. Later career Sarracino left office on 14 May 1835. Mariano Ch√°ves was acting g√©fe pol√≠tico until the arrival of Albino P√©rez in July 1835. P√©rez appointed Sarracino to the office of sub-comisario, but he was forced out of this office in 1836, charged with embezzlement while governor. Alleged misdeed included levying illegal taxes on traders, accepting bribes from Spanish priests who were being threatened with expulsion because they had not become Mexican citizens, and misusing public funds. On 22 October 1843 Francisco Sarracino, who represented the military party as opposed to the clerical party, was elected as alternative deputy to the Congress in Mexico City. The next day the members of the assembly for the newly formed Department of New Mexico were chosen. On 23 March 1844, as prefect of the Second District of the Department, Sarracino was one of the signatories to a peace treaty concluded with the Navajo in the Pueblo of Santo Domingo. The others were the governor Mariano Ch√°ves and Commandante General of the department Mariano Martinez. Following the occupation of New Mexico by United State troops in 1846, on 10 October 1848 Governor Donaciano Vigil arranged for a convention to be held at Santa Fe. Francisco Sarracino, Vigil, James Quinn and Juan Perea drafted a memorial to the United States Congress which asked for the immediate establishment of a civilian Territorial government. The petition opposed transfer of any of the New Mexico territory to Texas, and opposed the introduction of slavery.

He studied at the University of St Andrews and was a prot√©g√© of Dr. John Adamson who also persuaded him to become a photographer. At age 14, he was apprenticed to Dr. James, a local chemist and druggist, whilst studying at Madras College. Adamson later taught him the calotype process which he had earlier taught his famous brother, Robert Adamson. Adamson persuaded him to assist Lord Kinnaird in his calotype studio at Rossie Priory. Rodger enrolled at the Andersonian College of Glasgow to study medicine, but Adamson persuaded him to set up a professional business in calotyping in St Andrews. In 1853 he was awarded the Aberdeen Mechanics' Institution Medal. In 1855, Rodger was awarded the Silver Medal of the Society of the Arts for his paper on Collodion Calotype. He won the Edinburgh Photographic Society Medal in 1856 and the International Photographic Exhibition Medal in 1877. When the Photographic Society of Scotland was established in 1856, Rodger was one of its original members. Rodger's photographs can mainly be found in the St Andrews University Library and museum. He was also the author of the best known portrait of his master John Adamson in around 1865. Rodger himself was a prot√©g√© of Ivan Szabo (1822‚Äì1858) in the 1850s, who later opened his own studio in Edinburgh. Rodger was known to attend the Congregational Church at St Andrews, along with James Valentine, who he probably photographed in around 1850. There is a blue plaque in his honour in St Andrews outside his house and studio (now the University Careers Centre). It says \\"The first professional photographer in St. Andrews, he was taught the calotype process by Dr John Adamson, who induced him to make it his life's work. His pictorial record of the town, its people, the fisher folk and eminent visitors, brought him great fame. His favour with visiting royalty gave him journeys to London on Royal Photographic missions. He built this house and in it the first photographic studio in the town. Brewster, the Adamsons and Rodger made St. Andrews a world centre of photography.\\"Blue Plaque for Thomas Rodger References Further reading * Scottish photographers 1832 births 1883 deaths Alumni of the University of St Andrews People from St Andrews 19th-century Scottish people Alumni of the University of Strathclyde ","title":"Thomas Rodger"},{"id":"36472331","text":"The 1925‚Äì26 season was the 17th in the history of the Isthmian League, an English football competition.

Together, referred to as ACA, it is a leading representative of Americans residing outside the USA. ACA maintains close contacts with a caucus within the U.S. Congress established under the direction of Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. ACA interfaces with subsequent government administrations and other agencies in an attempt to change laws and regulations that place Americans overseas at a disadvantage to that of their fellow citizens living inside the United States. ACA sends a monthly \\"News Update\\" to its members with information on new legislation, rules and events which affect U.S. citizens, whether living overseas or at home. ACA‚Äôs web site also contains information on issues of concern to Americans overseas, including transmission of citizenship to offspring, taxation and voting. On taxation, ACA has written various pieces in its ongoing efforts to preserve the Foreign earned income exclusion (FEIE), which is vital for Americans living and working overseas to avoid full double taxation. Recently ACA played a significant role in improving the ballot request form used for absentee voting. Banking is another area of current activity to counteract disadvantages felt by American citizens abroad, who often cannot open new bank accounts, neither in the States because they have no address there to satisfy the Patriot Act, nor overseas because of the extra paperwork requirements imposed by the new Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). ACA works with the U.S. Embassy and other groups in a bipartisan manner on issues of common concern; it has co-organized town meetings across Switzerland producing a 10-page report; ACA founder, the late Andy Sundberg, was a moving force behind this exercise.

A Lokono, in 1949, he was the first Amerindian in Guyana to be ordained as an Anglican priest and canon. His linguistic work centred on preserving his native Arawak language and other Amerindian languages; he wrote An Arawak-English Dictionary (1989). Early life John Peter Bennett was born to Elsie Bennett and Jacob Bennett at Grant Faithful, near Kabakaburi and the Pomeroon River, in British Guiana on 30 November 1914. He attended school at Kabakaburi until the age of 12. On leaving school, Bennett went to work as a shop assistant in Great Troolie Island and later at a shop on the Pomeroon River. On 2 December 1938, Bennett married Clara James as St Mattias' Church in Kabakaburi. Their son, Maurice, was born in November 1944, and their daughter, Jennifer, was born in 1956. Priesthood Bennett began his training for the priesthood in Kabakaburi, where he studied with Reverend Martin B. Hirst from 1939 to 1944. Hirst, an English native, was an Anglican priest who served in Kabakaburi from 1939 to 1955. In October 1946, Bennett enrolled at Codrington College in Barbados to study for ordination. Bennett passed his General Ordination Examination (GOE) in 1949, and returned to British Guiana shortly afterwards. He was made a Deacon on 24 June 1949, and was ordained into the priesthood on 18 September of the same year at St George's Cathedral in Georgetown. After being ordained, Bennett served in the parishes of New Amsterdam (1949‚Äì53), Berbice River (1949‚Äì53), Rupununi (1950‚Äì56), Port Mourant (1953), Bartica (1953‚Äì57), Waramuri (1957‚Äì67) and Kabakaburi (1967‚Äì2011). He was made a canon of the Stall of David in 1976. Arawak-English Dictionary and later years In \\"An Outline of my life and work\\" in Kabethechino, Bennett recalls that he \\"was always interested in [the Arawak] language\\" although under British colonial rule, schools in British Guiana insisted on students' using English at school and at home, and discouraged the use of indigenous languages. Bennett wrote, > \\"People were made to feel that speaking their own language was something > sinful almost, certainly something bad which should be discouraged. I > remember even then, however, feeling that the ability to speak one's own > language was something good and shouldn't be lightly discarded.\\" On 20 June 1965, Richard Hart, a Jamaican historian undertaking research into Arawakan history and culture in the Caribbean, wrote to Bennett to ask for assistance. Concerned that \\"the Arawak language would be allowed to die out completely before a proper study of it had been made\\", Hart had contacted the Archbishop of the Anglican Diocese of Guyana to find out whether the church had studied the language. The Archbishop told Hart that he had no knowledge of any such studies, but referred him immediately to Bennett. Bennett's reply to Hart included an Arawak translation of The Lord's Prayer, and an account of the use of genders and \\"abstract conceptions\\" in the Arawak language. Hart responded, saying he was \\"thrilled\\" to discover that the priest shared his concern about the language and was \\"so well qualified to arrest its disappearance.\\" He suggested that Bennett should write a \\"little book on the language\\". These early letters marked the beginning of a correspondence that was to last until Hart's death in 1982. Their letters were collected by Janette Forte and published as a book entitled Kabethechino (1991) (Arawak for \\"close friends\\"). Bennett began to compile an Arawak-English dictionary in February 1967. In Kabethechino he writes: \\"In the beginning I wrote down the words that I could remember. Then at odd times a word would come to me ‚Äì while I was bathing or in bed at night\\". In 1967 he organized a series of monthly meetings where Arawak speakers would discuss Arawak words and their precise meanings. In 1971, Bennett underwent two operations in Jamaica to remove a tumor that had been found in his neck. The tumor had been undiagnosed for some time, and the surgery left Bennett partially paralyzed. Despite this loss of mobility, Bennett continued to work on the dictionary, which he completed in 1974. He continued to update it for the next 20 years. The Dictionary was first published as a double issue of the journal Archaeology and Anthropology in 1989. An updated edition was published by the Walter Roth Museum of Anthropology in 1994. Along with Bennett's other works on the Arawak language, the Arawak-English Dictionary is widely recognized as an invaluable contribution to the preservation of Arawakan. In addition, Bennett has been recognized for his assistance to other scholars in the field. Bennett died at his home in Kabakaburi in November 2011 at the age of 97.

All these relationships enabled it to serve as central Italy's gateway to the Orient. Included in the Papal States since 774, Ancona came under the influence of the Holy Roman Empire around 1000, but gradually gained independence to become fully independent with the coming of the communes in the 11th century, under the high jurisdiction of the papal state.Armando Lodolini, Le repubbliche del mare, publisher: Biblioteca di storia patria, Rome, 1967 (chapter Ancona) World Vexilology and Heraldry: Italy ‚Äì Centre Its motto was Ancon dorica civitas fidei (Dorian Ancona, city of faith), referencing the Greek foundation of the city. Ancona was an oligarchic republic ruled by six Elders, elected by the three terzieri into which the city was divided: S. Pietro, Porto and Capodimonte. It had a series of maritime laws known as Statuti del mare e del Terzenale (Statutes of the sea and of the arsenal) and Statuti della Dogana (Statutes of the Customs).James Reddie, Historical View of the Law of Maritime Commerce, W. Blackwood and sons, 1841. Maritime relations and warehouses Trade routes and warehouses of the maritime republic of Ancona The fondachi (colonies with warehouses and accommodation buildingsThese were small gated enclaves within a city, often just a single street, where the laws of the city were administered by a governor appointed from home, and there would be a church under home jurisdiction and shops with Italian styles of food.) of the Republic of Ancona were continuously active in Constantinople, Alexandria and other Byzantine ports, while the sorting of goods imported by land (especially textiles and spices) fell to the merchants of Lucca and Florence. In Constantinople there was perhaps the most important fondaco, where the Ancona inhabitants had their own church, Santo Stefano; in 1261 they were granted the privilege of having a chapel in the St. Sophia. Antonio Leoni, Historia of Ancona of 1812 . Other Ancona fondachi were in Syria (in Laiazzo and Laodicea), in Romania (in Constan≈£a), in Egypt (in Alexandria), in Cyprus (in Famagusta), in Palestine (in San Giovanni d'Acri), in Greece (in Chios), in Asia Minor (in Trebizond). Moving to the west, Ancona warehouses were present in the Adriatic in Ragusa and Segna, in Sicily in Syracuse and Messina, in Spain in Barcelona and Valencia, and in Africa in Tripoli.Guglielmo Heyd, Le colonie commerciali degli Italiani in Oriente nel Medioevo, volume 1; Antonelli, 1868. Coins Agontano The first reports of Ancona's medieval coinage begin in the 12th century when the independence of the city grew and it began to mint coinage without Imperial or papal oversight.Marco Dubbini e Giancarlo Mancinelli Storia delle monete di Ancona, edizioni Il lavoro editoriale, Ancona 2009, The agontano was the currency used by Republic of Ancona during its golden age. It was a large silver coin of 18-22 mm in diameter and a weight of 2.04‚Äì2.42 grams.Lucia Travaini, L'Agontano: una moneta d'argento per l'Italia medievale, Societa' Numismatica Italiana, 2003. Later and less famously Ancona began minting a gold Agnoto coin, also known as the Ancona Ducat. Specimens of this coin have survived from the 15th and 16th centuries, until the cities loss of independence in 1532.Ducato aureo emesso dalla zecca di Ancona nel XV secolo Art The artistic history of the republic of Ancona has always been influenced by maritime relations with Dalmatia and the Levant. Its major medieval monuments show a union between Romanesque and Byzantine art. Among the most notable are the Duomo, with a Greek cross and Byzantine sculptures, and the church of Santa Maria di Portonovo.Michele Polverari, Ancona e Bisanzio, pinacoteca comunale di Ancona, 1993 In the 14th century, Ancona was one of the centers of so-called \\"Adriatic Renaissance\\", a movement spread between Dalmatia, Venice and the Marches, characterized by a rediscovery of classical art and a certain continuity with Gothic art. The greatest architect and sculptor of this artistic current was Giorgio da Sebenico; the greatest painter was Carlo Crivelli. * Pietro Zampetti, Pittura nelle Marche, Nardini editore, Firenze, 1988 (pagina 333); * Fabio Mariano, La Loggia dei Mercanti in Ancona e l'opera di Giorgio di Matteo da Sebenico, editrice Il lavoro editoriale, 2003 .

The navigator and archaeologist Cyriacus of Ancona, was a restlessly itinerant Italian navigator and humanist who came from a prominent family of merchants. He has been called the Father of Archaeology: \\"Cyriac of Ancona was the most enterprising and prolific recorder of Greek and Roman antiquities, particularly inscriptions, in the fifteenth century, and the general accuracy of his records entitles him to be called the founding father of modern classical archeology.\\"Edward W. Bodnar, Later travels, with Clive Foss He was named by his fellow humanists \\"father of the antiquities\\", who made his contemporaries aware of the existence of the Parthenon, Delphi, the Pyramids, the Sphinx and other famous ancient monuments believed destroyed.Gianfranco Paci, Sergio Sconocchia, Ciriaco d'Ancona e la cultura antiquaria dell'umanesimo, Diabasis, 1998; . The navigator Grazioso Benincasa was born in Ancona; he was the best known Italian maritime cartographer of the fifteenth century and the author of several portolan charts of the Mediterranean. *Enciclopedia Treccani, Grazioso Benincasa; *The Italian cartographers of the Benincasa and Freducci Families and the so-called Borgiana Map of the Vatican Library, in Imago Mundi, X (1953), pp. 23‚Äì45 History After 1000, Ancona became increasingly independent, eventually turning into an important maritime republic, often clashing against the nearby power of Venice. Ancona always had to guard against the designs of both the Holy Roman Empire and the papacy. It never attacked other maritime cities, but was always forced to defend itself.Mario Natalucci, Ancona attraverso i secoli ‚Äì Dalle origini alla fine del Quattrocento, Unione arti grafiche, 1961. Despite a series of expeditions, trade wars and naval blockades, Venice never succeeded in subduing Ancona.Frederic Chapin Lane. Venice, A Maritime Republic, JHU Press , 1973 (p. 63) It was strong enough to push back the forces of the Holy Roman Empire three times; the intention of the Empire was to reassert his authority not only over Ancona, but on all Italian communes: in 1137 the city was besieged by emperor Lothair II, in 1167 by emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and in 1174 the Empire tried again. In that year, Christian I, archbishop of Mainz, archchancellor of Barbarossa, allied with Venice, besieged Ancona, but was forced to retreat. The Venetians deployed numerous galleys and the galleon Totus Mundus in the port of Ancona, while imperial troops lay siege from the land. After some months of dramatic resistance, the Anconitans were able to send a small contingent to Emilia-Romagna to ask for help. Troops from Ferrara and Bertinoro arrived to save the city and repelled the imperial troops and the Venetians in battle. One of the protagonists of the siege of 1174 was the widow Stamira, who had great courage by setting fire to the war machines of the besieger with an axe and a torch.Justine Firnhaber-Baker, Dirk Schoenaers, The Routledge History Handbook of Medieval Revolt, Taylor & Francis, 2016 (p. 143). In the struggle between the Popes and the Holy Roman Emperors that troubled Italy from the 12th century onwards, Ancona sided with the Guelphs. Francesco Podesti, Siege of Ancona of 1174 Francesco Podesti, Stamira Originally named ' (Latin for \\"Anconitan community\\"), Ancona had an independence de facto: Pope Alexander III (around 1100‚Äì1181) declared it a free city within the Church State; Pope Eugene IV confirmed the legal position defined by his predecessor and on September 2 1443 officially declared it a republic, with the name ';The act, with the name of Liber croceus magnus, is preserved at Ancona State Archive almost simultaneously Ragusa was officially called \\"republic\\", Josip Vrandeƒçiƒá, Miroslav Berto≈°a, Dalmacija, Dubrovnik i Istra u ranome novom vijeku , Barbat, 2007 (page 17); James Stewart, Croatia , New Holland Publishers, 2006 (page 285) confirming the fraternal bond that united the two Adriatic ports. Unlike other cities of central and northern Italy, Ancona never became a seignory. The Malatesta took the city in 1348 taking advantage of the black death and of a fire that had destroyed many of its important buildings. The Malatesta were ousted in 1383. In 1532, Ancona definitively lost its freedom and became part of the Papal States under Pope Clement VII; he took possession of it by political means. A symbol of the papal authority was the massive Citadel, used by Clement VII as a Trojan horse, to conquer the city. Communities in the Republic Port of Ancona (XVI century). Benvenuto Stracca, De mercatura. Ancona had Greek, Albanian, Dalmatian, Armenian, Turkish and Jewish communities.Marina Massa, Il patrimonio disperso: il \\"caso\\" esemplare di Carlo Crivelli, Regione Marche, 1999 (page 214). Ancona, as well as Venice, became a very important destination for merchants from the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century. The Greeks formed the largest of the communities of foreign merchants. They were refugees from former Byzantine or Venetian territories that were occupied by the Ottomans in the late 15th and 16th centuries. The first Greek community was established in Ancona early in the 16th century. At the opening of the 16th century there were 200 Greek families in Ancona.Mario Natralucci, Ancona durante i secoli, 1960. Most of them came from northwestern Greece, i.e. the Ionian islands and Epirus. In 1514, Dimitri Caloiri of Ioannina obtained reduced custom duties for Greek merchants coming from the towns of Ioannina, Arta and Avlona in Epirus. In 1518 a Jewish merchant of Avlona succeeded in lowering the duties paid in Ancona for all \\"the Levantine merchants, subjects to the Turk\\".Jan W. Wo≈õ, La comunit√† greca di Ancona alla fine del secolo XVI, Tipografia Sonciniana, 1979 In 1531 the Confraternity of the Greeks (Confraternita dei Greci) was established which included Orthodox Catholic and Roman Catholic Greeks. They secured the use of the Church of St. Anna dei Greci and were granted permission to hold services according to the Greek and the Latin rite. The church of St. Anna had existed since the 13th century, initially as \\"Santa Maria in Porta Cipriana,\\" on ruins of the ancient Greek walls of Ancona. In 1534 a decision by Pope Paul III favoured the activity of merchants of all nationalities and religions from the Levant and allowed them to settle in Ancona with their families. A Venetian travelling through Ancona in 1535 recorded that the city was \\"full of merchants from every nation and mostly Greeks and Turks.\\" In the second half of the 16th century, the presence of Greek and other merchants from the Ottoman Empire declined after a series of restrictive measures taken by the Italian authorities and the pope. Disputes between the Orthodox Catholic and Roman Catholic Greeks of the community were frequent and persisted until 1797 when the city was occupied by the French, who closed all the religious confraternities and confiscated the archive of the Greek community. The French would return to the area to reoccupy it in 1805‚Äì1806. The church of St. Anna dei Greci was re-opened to services in 1822. In 1835, in the absence of a Greek community in Ancona, it passed to the Latin Church.Greene Molly (2010) Catholic pirates and Greek merchants: a maritime history of the Mediterranean.

Thesaurismata (Instituto Ellenico di Studi Bizantini e Postbizantini di Venezia), vol. 37. Commercial law The Ancona trade in the Levant was the promoter of the birth of commercial law: the jurist Benvenuto Stracca, (Ancona, 1509‚Äì1579) published in 1553 the treatise De mercatura seu mercatore tractats; it was one of the first, if not the first, legal imprint dealing specifically with commercial law. This treatise focused on merchants and merchant contracts, practices and maritime rights, to which he soon added extensive discussions of bankruptcy, factors and commissions, third party transfers, and insurance. For this reason, Stracca is often considered the father of the commercial law and author of the first Italian treaty about insurance contracts. *Modernisation, National Identity and Legal Instrumentalism (Vol. I: Private Law): Studies in Comparative Legal History, Brill, 2019 (p. 118); *Vito Piergiovanni, The Courts and the Development of Commercial Law, Duncker & Humblot, 1987 (p. 14); *Encyclopedia Treccani, Benvenuto Stracca Alliance with Ragusa Carlo Crivelli, Madonna con Bambino, Civic Art Gallery of Ancona Commercial competition among Venice, Ancona and Ragusa was very strong because all of them bordered the Adriatic Sea. They fought open battles on more than one occasion. Venice, aware of its major economic and military power, disliked competition from other maritime cities in the Adriatic. Several Adriatic ports were under Venetian rule, but Ancona and Ragusa retained their independence. To avoid succumbing to Venetian rule, these two republics made multiple lasting alliances. Venice conquered Ragusa in 1205 and held it until 1382 when Ragusa regained de facto freedom, paying tributes first to the Hungarians, and after the Battle of Moh√°cs, to the Ottoman Empire. During this period Ragusa reconfirmed its old alliance with Ancona.

These cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Fibroblast-like synoviocytes in normal tissues  The inner lining of the joint consists of the synovium (also called the synovial membrane), a thin layer located between the joint capsule and the joint cavity. The word \\"synovium\\" is derived from the word \\"synovia\\" (or synovial fluid), which is a clear, viscous fluid produced by the synovium, and its main purpose is to reduce friction between the joint cartilages during movement. Synovium is also important to maintain proper joint function by providing the structural support and supply of the necessary nutrients to the surrounding cartilage. Synovial membrane is divided into two compartments ‚Äì the outer layer (subintima) and the inner layer (intima). The inner layer is mainly composed of two cell types, specialized macrophages (macrophage-like synovial cells) and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which are important in maintaining the internal joint homeostasis. These cells represent the main source of hyaluronic acid and also other glycoproteins, major components of the synovial fluid. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes are cells of mesenchymal origin that display many characteristics common with fibroblasts, such as expression of several types of collagens and protein vimentin, a part of cytoskeletal filaments. Unlike fibroblasts, fibroblast-like synoviocytes also secrete unique proteins, that are normally absent in other fibroblast lineages. These include especially lubricin, a protein crucial for the joint lubrication. Furthermore these cells express a number of molecules important for the mediation of the cell adhesion, such as cadherin-11, VCAM-1, various integrins and their receptors. Specific for fibroblast-like synoviocytes is also the expression of CD55; this protein is often used to identify this cell type in the synovium by immunohistochemistry.  The role of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis  Synovial hyperplasia (an increase in cell number) is a typical feature of the autoimmune disease called rheumatoid arthritis (RA). During the progression of this disease the synovial membrane becomes a place where constant inflammatory processes take place, which can eventually lead to cartilage damage and joint destruction and deformation. Due to the changes in proliferative and apoptotic processes the total number of cells increases in the synovium, and significantly increases also the number of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). These cells, together with other immune cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, dendritic cells and platelets, create an inflammatory environment in the synovium, attract more immune cells to the damaged place and thus contribute to the joint destruction. FLS that are present in the synovium during RA display altered phenotype compared to the cells present in normal tissues. They lose the property called contact inhibition (cells arrest their growth in the case when more cells come into contact with each other), and they also lose the growth dependency on adhesive surfaces; both these phenomena contribute to the increase in the number of FLS in the inflammatory tissue and are also typical for example for the growth of cancerous cells. In addition, these cells can produce a number of pro- inflammatory signalling molecules, especially Il-6 and IL-8, prostanoids and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may directly affect other cells and also participate in the inflammation enhancement. These processes are influenced by microvesicles derived from platelets, which can contribute to the activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes through secretion of IL-1. The aggressive phenotype of FLS in RA and the effect these cells have on their microenvironment can be summarized into hallmarks that distinguish them from healthy FLS. These hallmark features of FLS in RA are divided into 7 cell- intrinsic hallmarks and 4 cell-extrinsic hallmarks. The cell-intrinsic hallmarks are: reduced apoptosis, impaired contact inhibition, increased migratory invasive potential, changed epigenetic landscape, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, genomic instability and mutations, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism. The cell-extrinsic hallmarks of FLS in RA are: promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion, contributes to cartilage degradation, induces synovial angiogenesis, and recruits and stimulates immune cells.

It works closely with the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media. Following a resolution passed by the German Parliament, the Bundestag, it receives funding from the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development.  Foundation and History  Formed on 2 July 2009, the Foundation appointed its executive board on 1 November of that year. The foundation is the body commissioning the construction of the Humboldt Forum, a unique cultural project, and will be the building‚Äôs future owner. According to its statutes, the foundation pursues exclusively and directly charitable purposes of the promotion of art and culture, education, international sentiments and tolerance in all areas of culture, international understanding, as well as monument protection and preservation. With this in mind, the Foundation organizes its own events, exhibitions, readings and much more. With the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art, the State of Berlin and the Humboldt University of Berlin in the Humboldt Forum, the Foundation for the Humboldt Forum in the Berlin Palace will provide the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation with suitable premises for use free of charge.  Foundation's Purpose  The Foundation for the Humboldt Forum in the Berlin Palace is the owner and builder of the Humboldt Forum in Berlin Castle. The Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning is responsible for construction management for the construction project. The most important tasks of the foundation are beyond that: * Coordinating and bundling the interests of the partners in the Humboldt Forum. * The organization of a permanent exhibition with the theme \\"Historical Centre Berlin - Identity and Reconstruction\\". This once-in-a- century project has aroused fascination and discussion from the start. Persuasive, enthusiastic involvement by the general public was the decisive signal for the Bundestag, the German Parliament, to back the plans and provide public funds. This highly symbolic construction project, with its unique aim of bringing culture and academia into living discourse, is reliant on the active support of everyone who wants to make a lasting mark on this historic site.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/kitsch-or-classic-jury- out-on-palace-project-1.962455 In January 2016, the Foundation was renamed to Stiftung Humboldt Forum im Berliner Schloss.  Construction Project  On 4 July 2002, the German Bundestag adopted the recommendation of the International Commission of Experts on the Historical Centre of Berlin - a recommendation that was narrowly passed. The resolution adopted for this purpose provides for the urban redevelopment of the Spreeinsel to be largely based on the historical town plan and for the development of the palace area to be based on the cubature of the former Berlin palace. Furthermore, the German Bundestag followed the Commission's recommendation to rebuild the baroque facades on the north, west and south sides as well as in the Schl√ºterhof. = Reconstruction of the Berlin Palace = On 21 December 2007, the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning announced a competition for the reconstruction of the Berlin City Palace and the construction of the Humboldt Forum Berlin. First prize went to Franco Stella for his design. Structural work began in June 2013. After the reconstruction of the Berlin Palace, the building complex is to house the future Humboldt Forum, which is scheduled to open in 2019. = Contributions = The additional costs of the reconstruction of the baroque fa√ßades compared to a contemporary fa√ßade design amount to 80 million euros. These 80 million euros will be raised through a private collection of donations. In particular, the non-profit association F√∂rderverein Berliner Schloss has been collecting money since 2004 for the reconstruction of the baroque fa√ßades with a broad-based collection of donations. The acquisition of donations for the reconstruction of the historic facades and the construction of the Humboldt Forum is also one of the Foundation's tasks. As a cooperation partner of all private institutions that collect donations for the reconstruction of the Berlin Palace, all donations are received by the Foundation, which finances the reconstruction of the baroque facades.  Humboldt Forum  The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation will show the non-European collections of its National Museums in Berlin on the second and third floors. On the first floor, the Workshops of Knowledge, the knowledge archives of these museums, some of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, will be housed.

Established as a small family farm in 1981, it has grown to be one of Belize‚Äôs most recognized resorts. It has also received international recognition as a model for sustainable tourism and responsible travel by Conde Nast, National Geographic Adventure, Travel and Leisure magazines, and other publications and organizations. Chaa Creek runs educational and natural history programs with a focus on Belize Maya culture and civilization. Early history and development In the late 1970s Mick and Lucy Fleming decided to make Belize their home and purchased a disused, overgrown citrus farm on the banks of the Macal River in the Cayo District of Western Belize. As there was no road access into the property at that time, travel to and from San Ignacio, the closest town, was by river, utilising a dugout canoe as their neighbours had for centuries. The Flemings supported themselves by taking produce such as vegetables, milk, eggs, cheese and yoghurt into the Saturday markets in San Ignacio Town. In 1981 they opened Chaa Creek Cottages, the first jungle lodge in Belize, with two thatched roofed cottages built from local materials. In 1983 the British Army Corps of Engineers built a road into Chaa Creek, which facilitated the construction of a dining room for the now six cottages. Within two years another six cottages, gift shop, water tower and staff quarters were built. By 1988 there were 16 cottage rooms, and electrical generation allowed for luxuries such as ice and hot water. A landing for a growing fleet of canoes and other improvements were added. All of the cottages were upgraded in 1990 and a new office was established in nearby San Ignacio Town. As the property expanded, trails were established throughout the growing nature reserve as horseback riding tours, mountain biking and trekking were introduced. By 1992 there were 26 members of staff in residence at Chaa Creek. Infrastructure was continually upgraded with new stables for the growing herd of horses. Chaa Creek also hosted teams of archaeologists conducting research on the property and nearby sites. The Chaa Creek Natural History Centre and Blue Morpho Butterfly Breeding Centre were established at Chaa Creek in 1993. Both centres continue to raise awareness of the local environment and encourage scientific research while recording and displaying, for the public and students, the results of scientific investigation and artefacts found on the property. By 1997 there were a total of 21 cottages including several luxury suites, and the next year electric lighting and fans were added to the rooms In 1999, the Macal River Camp at Chaa Creek with ten bungalow style casitas, and a central dining/social area was renovated. In 2003 Chaa Creek acquired the adjacent Ixchel Medicine Trail (now known as the Maya Medicinal Plant Trail), which was established to investigate and perpetuate traditional Maya healing practices and medicinal plants. The Maya Organic Farm, which showcases traditional Maya agricultural practices and also supplies fresh vegetables for the resort, was also established. Along with the many Maya archaeological sites and temple on Chaa Creek, and with the Natural History Centre, they contribute to visitors‚Äô understanding and appreciation of the Maya habitation of Belize. Chaa Creek currently consists of 28 cottages, suites, and villas and employs over 150 staff. Ecological awareness and sustainable development The Flemings had always maintained an interest in sustainable development and have said that Chaa Creek was operating as an eco- resort before they had even heard the term. As most of their neighbors were subsistence farmers using centuries old traditional farming and construction methods, they sought to learn what they could about traditional methods while investigating newer technologies and methods such as permaculture, intensive farming, solar power and waste recycling. As the resort grew and the Flemings were able to purchase land adjacent to theirs, they created a private nature reserve intended to provide a safe habitat for the many native species of flora and fauna of western Belize. At the resort and Macal River Camp, careful attention was paid to sustainable development and waste management, with innovations such as crushing glass bottles for use as aggregate in construction projects, solar electrical generation, maximized recycling, organic farming to supply the Lodge and other innovations. Chaa Creek also sponsored several environmental investigations and initiatives, including the US based RiverKeepers‚Äô investigation of the impact of further dam construction on the Macal River, which included a visit by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the establishment of the Belize Foundation for Conservation and the Bay Palm Reforestation project. Chaa Creek has also entered into partnerships with the Yerkes Primate Institute and the Foundation for Wildlife Conservation (Howler Monkey Reintroduction program), the New York Botanical Gardens ( Agroforestry Research and Vascular Plant Cataloguing projects), the Zoological Society of Milwaukee County‚Äôs international Birds Without Borders organisation and other groups and peak bodies. Focus on the Maya The Chaa Creek area has been continually occupied by the Maya for at least 2500 years, and was an important trade and habitation area. The well-known Maya sites of Cahal Pech and the Temple of Xunantunich are nearby, and over 70 Maya sites have been recorded on the 365 acre nature reserve. In the course of farming and later development activities, many Maya artefacts, dwelling, storage, administrative and temple sites were uncovered at Chaa Creek, leading the owners to develop a keen interest in the local Maya history and culture. This led to sponsoring studies such as ongoing archaeology research by the University of California, Dr Jaime Awe of the Belize Ministry of Archaeology and other institutions and groups. In the lead up to and during the winter solstice of 2012, the end of the Maya Long Count and an important historical epoch for the Maya, Chaa Creek is sponsoring a range of seminars, lectures, workshops and cultural activities to further credible Maya research and dispel popular myths surrounding that year and Maya interpretations of its significance.The Archaeology Network Environmental education In addition to educating visitors, the Chaa Creek Natural History Centre and Nature Reserve hosts field trips for many local and international schools, colleges and universities each year. The Environmental Education Outreach is a schools-based environmental education program Chaa Creek runs in Belize. An ongoing partnership with the State University of New York to annually produce and host a five-day Summer Teachers Institute in Environmental Studies and Culture teachers training program promotes sustainable use of natural resources while promoting an understanding of Belize‚Äôs cultural heritage. The Bush Medicine Camp in partnership with the Ixchel Tropical Research Foundation is an annual youth camp that focuses on Belize Maya medicinal plants and their traditional uses. Chaa Creek also hosts local and international student interns for work experience or research projects.

In British Columbia, it is a historical issue dating back to the 1930s and the public protests against materialistic lifestyle held by the radical religious sect of the Freedomites, whose pacifist beliefs led to their exodus from Russia to Canada at the end of the 19th century. The Svobodniki became famous for their public nudity: mostly for their nude marches in public and the acts of arson committed also in the nude.  Law  In Canada, the law on public decency is found in sections 173 and 174 of the Criminal Code. However, what constitutes an indecent act is not defined, and is open to interpretation by the courts. In 1991, toplessness as an indecent act was challenged in Guelph, Ontario, by Gwen Jacob, who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency. Part of her defense was the double standards between men and women. Although she was convicted, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. This case determined that being topless is not indecent within the meaning of the Criminal Code. However, it did not establish any constitutional right of equality. This case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in British Columbia and Saskatchewan who faced similar charges. Although each province and territory reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases, the Ontario case has proved influential. Since the matter has not been determined by the Supreme Court of Canada, it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in Canada, but interpretation of moral law in Canada has become increasingly liberalised.Valverde, Mariana (1999). \\"The Harms of Sex and the Risks of Breasts: Obscenity and Indecency in Canadian Law\\" . Social Legal Studies 1999; (8): 181. There do not appear to have been any further women charged in Canada since these cases were decided.  Ontario  Topfreedom is allowed in Ontario, set by the precedent in the case of Gwen Jacob. The acting executive director of Municipal Licensing and Standards said that while \\"there's no bylaw that governs toplessness\\", \\"it is legal for women to go topless on the streets of Toronto\\" according to a National Post article. He added that parks require clothing, except, for example, the clothing optional Hanlan's Point Beach. =Gwen Jacob= Gwen Jacob ‚Äì topfree rights activist ‚Äì outside court in Guelph, 1991 On July 19, 1991, a very hot and humid day, Gwen Jacob, a University of Guelph student, was arrested, after walking down a street in Guelph, Ontario, while topless after removing her shirt when the temperature was and was charged with indecency under Section 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Police stated that they acted following a complaint from a woman who was upset that one of her children had seen Jacob topless. Jacob stated she did it because men were doing it and she wanted to draw attention to the double standard. She was found guilty and fined $75. In her defence she argued that breasts were merely fatty tissue. In finding her guilty, the judge stated that breasts were \\"part of the female body that is sexually stimulating to men both by sight and touch,\\" and therefore should not be exposed.R. v. Jacob, Ontario Court (Prov. Div.), January 17, 1992. She appealed, but her appeal was dismissed by the Ontario Court (General Division), and she further appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal.DeLonghi, G. \\"Court hears Jacob's indecency appeal\\", The Guelph Tribune, June 24, 1992, p.3 In the meantime, protests against Jacob's arrest and conviction led to further charges against others, in particular R. v. ArnoldR. v. Arnold, Ontario Court (Prov. Div.), February 25, 1993 [1993] o.j. 471 but in this case McGowan P.C.J. applied the test of community standard of tolerance, following Butler, stating that the action of being topless caused no harm and thus did not exceed community standards of tolerance. She commented, \\"Undoubtedly, most women would not engage in this conduct for there are many who believe that deportment of this nature is tasteless and does not enhance the cause of women. Equally undoubtedly, there are men today who cannot perceive of woman's breasts in any context other than sexual. It is important to reaffirm that the Canadian standards of tolerance test does not rely upon these attitudes for its formulation. I have no doubt that, aside from their personal opinions of this behaviour, the majority of Canadians would conclude that it is not beyond their level of tolerance.\\" Jacob was acquitted on December 9, 1996, by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent. The court held that \\"there was nothing degrading or dehumanizing in what the appellant did. The scope of her activity was limited and was entirely non- commercial. No one who was offended was forced to continue looking at her\\" and that furthermore \\"the community standard of tolerance when all of the relevant circumstances are taken into account\\" was not exceeded. Although Jacob claimed she had a constitutional right, the court did not address this. The Ontario Government decided not to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, and thus it has remained the prevailing interpretation of the Criminal Code in Ontario. Since then, the court ruling has been tested and upheld several times. R. v. Jacob has been cited in similar decisions in other provinces and by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Labaye, and is taught in Criminal Law courses. The decision by the Ontario Government not to appeal to the Supreme Court was based on the likelihood that the court would not grant leave. This caused considerable public concern as well as attempts by municipalities to preempt the law by passing more restrictive bylaws. (Uniform Law Conference of Canada 1999). The Ontario Government did contact the Federal Government regarding amending the law to make such actions clearly illegal.Letter from Charles Harnick to Allan Rock, dated February 10, 1997, This was not pursued. While the community standards test is not an immutable part of indecency jurisdiction, community tolerance is likely to be partly determined by the degree to which the public is exposed to top freedom on a regular basis. Jacob's victory is now celebrated annually in Guelph. 2011 marked the 20th anniversary of Gwen Jacob's walk, and to celebrate some students re-enacted it. =Other cases= Another important distinction is that of whether the nature of the act is commercial or not. In Jacob, the court stressed that it was not. In contrast in of R. v. Gowan Gowan, a sex worker, under the impression that exposing the breasts was now legal, solicited clients at an intersection, motioned to her breasts and called out \\"Do you want to fuck?\\". She was consequently charged with and convicted of engaging in an indecent act, under the same section as in Jacob, 173 (1) (a).R v. Gowan [3 March 1998] Doc. Ottawa 97-20544 (Ontario Court of Justice, Provincial Division). In 2015, Alysha Brilla and her sisters Tameera, Nadia and Alysha Mohamed, were stopped by the police in Kitchener for cycling topless. The musician and activist filed a complaint with Waterloo Regional Police. They subsequently held a rally at Waterloo Town Square, called \\"Bare With Us\\", to educate the public about the right to go topfree. =Public parks and facilities= Despite this, women still faced discrimination in public facilities. In 1997, Fatima Pereira Henson was charged with trespassing for swimming topless in Cambridge, but the charges were dropped. She was then charged again, and also this was dropped by the crown, so the City initiated its own prosecution. Although this too was dropped, a bylaw specifically prohibiting top-free swimming was passed. Eventually her efforts led to a new bylaw allowing top-free swimming. In Toronto in 2011, a Go Topless Day rally was refused a permit to meet in a park, so they marched down the streets, with a police escort.  British Columbia  In 2000 a similar case to Jacob's resulted in acquittal. Linda Meyer, a top-free activist inspired by the Gwen Jacob case, appeared in a number of public venues topless. A bylaw in the municipality of Maple Ridge stated \\"females over the age of 8 years shall fully cover all portions of their nipples and aureole with opaque apparel\\". On July 1, 1997, Linda Meyer went to the swimming pool in the bottom half of her bikini. Some parents complained and she was charged, but the judge in this case (Justice Holmes) voided the bylaw stating, inter alia: > [55] In R. v. Jacob, supra, a woman who walked bare-breasted on a city > street and then reclined top-free on the front step to her home was > acquitted on appeal of committing an indecent act. The Court found the > baring of her breasts was not harmful to anyone. There was nothing degrading > or dehumanizing in her conduct. The Court noted anyone who was offended was > not forced to look. > > [57] I do not find in the evidence support for the view that the parks > could not operate in orderly fashion if a female were to bare her breasts in > a circumstance that did not offend criminal laws of nudity. The evidence > suggests the Section 3A amendment to the Park By-Law was more a reaction to > a frustration that the criminal law was not supporting the moral standards > in regard to females who chose to bare their breasts in public that some > Maple Ridge citizens desired. > > [64] The defendant's 18A application is allowed. In 2008 Vancouver, British Columbia, was a location of the World Naked Bike Ride  Saskatchewan  In 1997, a 64-year-old woman, Evangeline Godron together with Kathleen Rice sunbathed topless in a Regina park and were charged for doing so. On July 22, a judge in the Provincial Court ruled that their behaviour did not violate community standards. However she and other women then swam in a pool without a top. Again parents complained. Godron was arrested for assault, because she refused to leave the pool when requested. Although she appealed this, she was unsuccessful. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which declined to hear it. However this was a question of assault, not of indecency.  Public opinion  A 1992 poll showed that 62% of Canadians were opposed to women having topfreedom, with women being more likely to be opposed.Gallup Canada 1992. More men than women back topless right. Toronto Star A more detailed survey was undertaken in 1998,Compas polling 1998. Modern life survey of the Canadian adult population and a detailed analysis was published by Fischtein and colleagues in 2005 (Fischtein et al. 2005). This showed context to be important, for instance 72% were opposed to being topless on a city street, 62% in parks, but only 48% on beaches. In all cases women were more opposed to toplessness.

Military activities and political career In the 1980s, Ahmad Khan Samangani originally fought in the Jamiat-e Islami against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. After the Soviet withdrawal Samangani, himself an Afghan Uzbek, joined the Uzbek-dominated Junbish-i Milli led by Abdul Rashid Dostum. In the late 1990s, Samangani commanded thousands of men in his area as a military commander in the Junbish faction of the United Front (Northern Alliance). Though Junbish's main forces were defeated by the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif in 1998, he and his local forces remained one of several Junbish armed elements operating in the resistance against the Taliban inside Samangan Province, Afghanistan. After the fall of the Taliban regime, he moved closer to Afghan President Hamid Karzai and away from Dostum. But in the 2009 Afghan Presidential Election Samangani supported Abdullah Abdullah against Karzai. Abdul Khan Samangani was said to be close to Balkh governor Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor, also a supporter of Abdullah Abdullah. Lately, Samangani was also said to have made contacts with Dostum again. Samangani became a member of parliament in 2011 and was considered a key leader in Samangan and northern Afghanistan. Death The suicide bombing attack which took place at around 8 am on 14 July 2012 at Samangani's daughter's wedding party killed 22 people and wounded 60. The attack occurred in the capital of Samangan province, Aybak. The attacker came to the party as a guest and embraced Samangani before detonating his explosives. Among the dead were also the police and intelligence chiefs of Samangan Province, and a division commander of the Afghan National Army (ANA). Balkh governor Atta Mohammad Noor had also been on his way to the wedding, but escaped the attack.

It was developed for communications between a WITS Master Station and its remotely connected WITS Field Devices (for example, Remote Telemetry Units). WITS maintains two protocols, WITS-DNP3 and WITS-IoT. * WITS-DNP3 is a DNP3 protocol based protocol primarily used for larger 'always-on' utility assets. WITS-DNP3 is very well suited to traditional SCADA Telemetry control operations. WITS-DNP3 is based on the DNP3 protocol level2+, and uses DNP3‚Äôs generic protocol extension mechanism to define and provide the additional functionality required by water industry users. WITS-DNP3 provides Secure Authentication between Master and Field Device and uses device vendor supplied Configuration Applications for limited plug and play functions. * WITS-IoT is a JSON based application layer protocol designed for very large numbers of smaller devices which may be online only for brief periods. WITS-IoT is well suited to the monitoring and logging of large numbers of infrastructure assets using battery powered devices over a wireless WAN. WITS-IoT provides for robust security using industry standard protocols, enjoys wide and easy availability of its protocol stack and adds full plug and play to WITS for the first time. While initially developed by and for the Water Industry, the WITS protocols are generic SCADA Communications protocols. The WITS functionality was originally defined in the mid 2000s by the UK water companies via a joint UK Water Industry / equipment vendors team.The WITS-DNP3 Telemetry Protocol During 2011, ownership of the WITS protocol passed into the hands of the WITS Protocol Standards Association for future management and maintenance.Water Briefing announcement on the formation of the WITS Protocol Standards AssociationAnnouncement of the formation of the WITS Protocol Standards Association  Technical details  WITS-DNP3 adds functionality to the underlying DNP3 protocol :- * Device Profiles ** The characteristics and capabilities of a particular WITS-DNP3 Field Device are defined in a ‚ÄòDevice Pofile‚Äô, which is in XML format. This 'device profile' is read into the WITS-DNP3 Master Station and used to limit what a user can do to that particular Field Device. * Device Configuration ** WITS-DNP3 provides Master Stations with the ability to incrementally change the configuration of Field Devices. This is done using DNP3 file transfer to send incremental configuration updates to a Field Device. This mechanism provides flexibility for managing the configuration of remote Field Devices from a central location. Examples of configuration changes could be analog input scaling, definition of alarm limits and enabling / disabling inputs. * Information exchange between a WITS-DNP3 Master Station and Field Device ** WITS-DNP3 defines seven DNP3 'Data Sets' for Field Devices to report data to a Master Station and for a Master Station to control a Field Device. These are as follows :- ** for reporting data - change of state or transgression of a limit ** for monitoring the health of a device ** for requesting a device to 'call in' and test a communications path ** for controlling programs sent to a Field Device ** for controlling whether inputs cause events to be sent to the Master Station * Data Logging ** WITS-DNP3 Field Devices can record local data log files. These contain data with a time stamp and retrieved later by a Master Station. The logs are retrieved by means of DNP3 file transfer. WITS- IoT provides, as a minimum, the same base functionality as WITS-DNP3. WITS-IoT takes the WITS-DNP3 protocol definition and replaces DNP3 with JSON structures and a new communications life-cycle description.  Accreditation  WITS-DNP3 devices are 'accredited' in one of two forms: * WITS Self certified **Tests have been conducted by the vendor themselves using their own test equipment. **Tests did not involve any third party. **The tests demonstrate compliance with the WITS PSA Test Specification. *WITS Verified **Tests have been carried out using WITS verified equipment in conjunction with one or more third parties who can provide WITS Verified devices for testing. **Verified Outstations have been tested against two verified WITS Master Stations **Verified WITS Master Stations have been tested against three WITS verified field devices **Testing has confirmed compliance with the WITS PSA Test Specification.

It is composed of nine villages: Maniband ŸÖÿß ŸÜ€å ÿ®ŸÜÿØ, Jabaghi ÿ¨ÿ®⁄´€ç, Zara Doghy ÿ≤⁄ìŸá ⁄âŸà⁄´€ç, Kot Koshah ⁄©ŸàŸº ⁄©Ÿà ÿ¥ÿßŸá, Sarybegham ÿ≥ÿß ÿ±€ç ÿ®Ÿäÿ∫ŸÖ, Kot ⁄©ŸàŸº, Ghwandy ÿ∫ŸàŸÜ⁄âÿ¶, Fazal Abad and Shah Kuronu ÿ¥ÿßŸá ⁄©Ÿà ÿ±ŸàŸÜŸá. It lies in Timergara tehsil, east of the road from Timergara to Dir. The inhabitants of this area belong to the Mandal, clan of Utman Khel. The Utmankhel is one of karlanri pashtun or Afghan tribes, who appeared in concert with other tribes like Yousafzai and Tarkalani. They settled initially in the area of Malakand, Bajuar and Mohmand Agency. These people were mostly connected with trade because the lands were not suited for agriculture. History View of graveyard with name of Toar Baba =Tor Baba = Religion had strong influence in the social spheres of these Afghan tribes which resulted in many religious families. Such families had capacity to have an effect not only on religious matters but on temporal affairs as well (e.g., Akhund family in Swat and Dir). In Utman Khel tribe, pious superstition also helped to build up religious families like Shaikhan. The Shaikhan are the descendants of Tor Baba or Abdur Rahim Khan (source, local elders). The Abdur Rahim Khan was born in Bajawar and belonged to Mandal, a clan of Utmankheil tribe. He migrated from Bajawar in the late seventeenth century and settled in Timergara. He was known as Tor Baba for his piousness. Abdur Rahim Khan and Akhund Ilyas (d.1676 A.D) were disciples of Shaikh Adam Binori (ref. Mulana Habib Ahmad of Morany, Dir) and according to Muhammad Amin Badakhshi most followers and Khalifas of Adam Binori were Afghan people that made suspect Binori in the eyes of the Mughal officials and nobility. His shrine lies in the graveyard named after him. The people of Jandol, Dir Khas, Maidan, Adenzai, Swat, Bajaur and Malakand Agency used to visit the shrine but local clerics issued decrees declaring it as ‚ÄòBid‚Äôat‚Äô or forbidden in Islam. There are two other tombs in Moranay (Dir Lower) and Shagokas (Dir Lower) with names of Tor Baba, and their descendants in the area assumed the same clan, Mandal (who was the elder son of Baba Utman). According to Qazi Abdul Haleem Asar Afghani, the original name of Tor Baba in Moranay village was Muhammad Anwar Baig. It is possible that these three were brothers or belong to the same clan because Tor Baba and Akhund were used as religious titles at that time. For example, the father of Akhund Ilyas was also known as Tor Baba but nobody knows about his real name. =Descendants= Genealogy of people from Dara Utmankheil Tor Baba had two sons; Mullah Baba and Islam Jan Baba whose descendants live in the closely situated nine villages. Tor Baba had granted lands (Pashto: ÿ≥Ÿäÿ±ÿ¶) in Timergara, Shati Dara and Arang for his piousness and religious background while he had lost his paternal land in Bajawar. All these lands were divided equally among his sons. Muhammad Sher Khan, son of Mullah Baba, moved to Shati Dara and lived there for more than 100 years and his brother, Younas Khan, received the land of Jabaghi; a village in Shaikhan Timergara. In the early 20th century, Sher‚Äôs grandsons came back to Shaikhan due to the possible enmity in Shati. They then bought or purchased lands from Ibrahim Khel, the Mailizai clan of Yousufzai, over the course of next few decades. The land in Arang and half in Timergara were allocated to Islam Jan (the ascendant of ManiBand, Kotkoshah, ZaraDogy and Ghwndy). These people are also known as Shaikhan which are not representing their ethnicity but it is related with Abdur Rahim Khan who got this title after following Shaikh Adam Binori.Sheikh that literally means \\"elder\\". It is commonly used to designate the frontman of a tribe who got this title after his father, or an Islamic scholar who got this title after graduating from the basic Islamic school. Akhund khel and shaikhan are various tribal communities in Pakistan and Afghanistan that were simply \\"spiritual fraternity\\" of unrelated disciples of pious personalities e.g., Akhund khel are pashtun tribes but there are also akhund khel that are known as Sadat. Another group that identifies as Sheikh Mohammadi but there exist no kinship connection. In the 19th century (1895), grandson of Sher Khan, Zaer Mohammed, the friend and supporter of Umara Khan and Muhammad Shah Khan who had protected Shamorgar Qela at Upper Dir, defeated invaders of Sharif Khan but later on he was arrested by Muhammad Sharif Khan. The Jirga system still exists and most disputes are resolved by local elders. =Notable People = #Zaer Mohammad (Ally of Umara Khan, 1895) =People and Economy = The total population is about approximately 2900 according to 1998 census (approximation). The area has poor agriculture system so their main economy is based on Middle East. The education ratio is high in males. There are only five primary schools and lacking middle and high schools.

WCS Canada is distinguished from other environmental organizations through its role in generating science through applied field-based research and using this research to achieve conservation results. Major issues addressed include protected-area design, wildlife monitoring and recovery, ecosystem restoration, and community-based conservation.  Mission  The stated mission of WCS Canada is: :The Wildlife Conservation Society Canada conserves wildlife and wild places by understanding the issues, developing science-based solutions, and working with others to carry out conservation actions across Canada.  History  WCS' engagement in Canada dates back to 1905 when William Hornaday (one of the founders of the New York Zoological Society, the original name of WCS) visited the Crowsnest Pass in southeast British Columbia and called for conservation of the area where - 100 years later - WCS Canada still has a major conservation presence.Weaver, John L.

Retrieved 4 July 2012. Between 1949 and 1981, WCS supported various activities in Canada, including arctic expeditions to Bylot Island and research on seals, merlin, whooping cranes, polar bears, and bowhead whales. Beginning in 1997 WCS scientist, John Weaver, performed Canada lynx surveys in Kootenay and Banff National Parks and WCS involvement in Canada has been continuous ever since. WCS Canada was established as an organization in 2004 and has since expanded to numerous field projects in six regions of Canada (Arctic, Northern Appalachians, Northern Ontario, Northern Boreal Mountains, Southern Rocky Mountains, and Nahanni National Park) and maintains involvement in a number of WCS global programs.  Conservation of wildlife and wild places  WCS Canada works to conserve wildlife and wild places by focusing their field research on six regions of Canada and across a suite of ecologically important species. Their research addresses ecological threats associated with global climate change, natural resource extraction and habitat fragmentation. By focusing on a strategic portfolio of species including woodland caribou, wolverine, Canada lynx, lake trout, and American bison, WCS Canada extends its understanding of conservation needs beyond individual sites and threats. WCS Canada also provides science to decision- makers providing a critical foundation for credible decision making. It also plays a key role in helping decision makers and the general public understand the risks and impacts of choices for wildlife and ecosystems. WCS Canada scientists are informing land use planning and related policies by generating science and by applying findings to relevant conservation processes. The results and expertise derived from WCS research and its partners have a demonstrated track record of improving policies and legislation to conserve northern wildlife and habitats. WCS Canada is working on transboundary conservation in the Northern Appalachian\\\\Acadia Ecoregion that extends from New York state to Nova Scotia in collaboration with Two Countries, One Forest, focusing on wildlife connectivity, mapping the Human Footprint and studying the ecology of small carnivores (e.g. lynx and marten). Their work in Northern Ontario, the largest intact boreal forest in North America, addresses the threats of development and climate change to wildlife and fish including caribou, wolverine, wolves, Canada lynx, lake sturgeon, walleye, and lake trout. WCS scientists are also working in the Northern Boreal Mountains in Yukon and northern British Columbia where government-mandated land use planning is proceeding region by region. These planning processes allow WCS scientists to engage is land use zoning and protected area delineation, by providing new science, technical support and stakeholder commentary. Their current research in this region includes a study on the value of valley bottom habitats for wildlife, habitat management for caribou, and mapping intact, priority ecosystems. In the Southern Rocky Mountains, WCS is working to evaluate high-quality habitat and connectivity for a suite of sensitive species including grizzly bears, wolverines, lynx, elk, mountain goats, bull trout, and westslope cutthroat trout.The Transboundary Flathead: A Critical Landscape for Carnivores in the Rocky Mountains.

Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, Fish and Wildlife Division, Alberta Species at Risk Report No. 50. Edmonton, AB. Recently, WCS Canada conducted research on three focal species in Nahanni National Park Reserve - grizzly bear, caribou and Dall's sheep. These studies provided scientific support for a massive expansion of Nahanni National Park (from 1,862 square miles to 12,000 square miles) to help ensure its ecological integrity. WCS Canada also undertook research in the Western Arctic including understanding the terrestrial food web, assessing the threat of mining, and polar bear conservation. While an independent organisation, WCS Canada is an integral part of a network of WCS Global Programs. Some of the global conservation projects that WCS Canada is involved in include wildlife health, conservation of the Ituri Forest of DR Congo, community-managed forests of Madagascar, conservation of tigers in nine countries (Cambodia, PR China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Russia, and Thailand), and conservation of the Iranian cheetah.

In her presentation at the 14th North American Caribou Workshop in November 2012, Justina Ray described her work with COSEWIC in developing the twelve designatable units (DUs) for caribou in Canada. In a 2019 Globe and Mail article, Ray explained that the 11 designatable units are categorized as \\"distinct because of a combination of their habitat, ecology and genetic differences. Some units contain only one herd; larger units have dozens.\\"updated February 18, 2019 In her October 31, 2018 article in Canadian Geographic, Ray described how their \\"single most challenging task was systematically evaluating the status of these 11 groups of caribou. The committee did this through the production of six status assessment reports during the period from 2012 to 2017, which involved the collective efforts of hundreds of people. For each report, it took two to three years to assemble the data (including Indigenous knowledge), then compile them into a comprehensive report, subject the report to robust review, before finally delivering the results to the COSEWIC table for a vote on status.

Chaves County, New Mexico is named after him. Family Jos√© Mariano Chaves was born on 31 December 1799, the son of New Mexico Governor Francisco Xavier Ch√°vez (1822‚Äì1823), a descendant of don Pedro Dur√°n de Ch√°vez, a conquistador from the Extremadura province of Spain. The governor Jos√© Antonio Chaves (1829‚Äì1832) was another prominent member of the Ch√°vez family in New Mexico. Mariano Chaves was a member of the New Mexican landowning elite. An Anglo-American visitor to Santa Fe in 1846 described the wealth displayed in his house, which was furnished with Brussels carpets, white marble tables, gilt framed mirrors and candelabras. Mariano Chaves married Dolores Perea, daughter of Pedro Jose Perea, a descendant of an early New Mexico settler. Their son Jos√© Francisco Chaves served three terms in the United States House of Representatives as Delegate from the New Mexico Territory, 1865 to 1871. After Mariano's death, Dolores Perea married the prosperous trader Henry Connelly in 1849. Dr. Connelly was governor of New Mexico Territory during the American Civil War. Career Mariano Chaves was acting political chief in 1835 after Francisco Sarracino had left office, holding this position until Albino P√©rez became political chief. He was chief of staff of Governor Manuel Armijo during the revolt of 1837. He became inspector general of the New Mexico military forces. In 1840 he served as political chief. In September 1841 a force of Texans entered New Mexico heading for Santa Fe. They were captured by superior Mexican forces and forced to march south to Mexico City, suffering ill treatment on the journey. Chaves provided assistance to the prisoners in the form of blankets and provisions. In April 1843 Mariano's younger brother, the trader Antonio Jos√© Chaves, was travelling along the Santa Fe Trail between Santa Fe and Independence, Missouri when he was attacked, robbed and murdered by a party of Texans. The killers were caught by U.S. troops and the leaders put to death, largely due to the influence of Chaves. Early in 1844, Governor Manuel Armijo decided to give up active involvement in the governor position, and appointed Mariano Chaves as gobernado interino (acting governor) as of 31 January 1844. Mariano Chaves resigned on 10 April due to illness. Felipe Sena, President of the Departmental Assembly, then became acting governor, although Armijo remained governor. In March 1844, General Santa Anna removed Armijo from office and appointed the commandante militar, Mariano Mart√≠nez de Lejanza, as \\"constitutional governor\\". Martinez assumed office at the end of April and held the position until 1 May 1845. Jos√© Mariano Chaves died in May 1845.

Plot The story tells of two Canadian brothers, Summy Skim and Ben Raddle, unexpectedly bequeathed a mining claim in the Klondike. They encounter many things such as disaster, disease, extreme weather. On the way back to Montreal from where the two cousins came, Ben Raddle and Summy Skim were trapped in a large flood that flooded the entire Klondike. Ben has a disease and a broken leg, that is where he is taken to the hospital to be seen by the trustful Dr. Pilcox. Summy Skim and their guide (Bill Steel) bring the unfortunate man to the hospital, where he is healed a few months later. On the way out to a hunt, Summy Skim, Bill Steel and the trusted Indian Neluto, discover a man torn apart, lying under a tree. They come to the rescue, and bring this man back to the hospital where he dies a few days later. Before this man died, he told Ben Raddle and Summy Skim of a volcano of pure gold named \\"Golden Mount\\". It is then, that the cousins and their guides get a caravan together to return to the Golden Mount. While on a hunt, Summy Skim and Neluto discover the two villains with their caravan wanting to take over the volcano. Summy Skim and Neluto return to camp where they tell the others, and a plan is sorted out. Ben Raddle plans out that he can force the volcano erupt by emptying the river into a hole dug into the volcano.

Ubiquitin is a signal added to an incorrectly folded protein, which allows it to be degraded by the proteasome, and the amino acid constituents can be recycled. Function This family of proteins is involved in a variety of additional cell processes, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), spindle pole body duplication, and cell growth. Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) allows the cell to selectively negatively regulate intracellular proteins. Protein degradation helps to maintain protein quality control, signalling, and cell cycle progression. UBA has been proposed to limit ubiquitin chain elongation and to target polyubiquitinated proteins to the 26S proteasome for degradation. They have been identified in modular proteins involved in protein trafficking, DNA repair, proteasomal degradation, and cell cycle regulation. UBA bind to ubiquitin and aids all the cellular processes involved with ubiquitin; this includes: *Antigen processing *Apoptosis *Biogenesis of organelles *Cell cycle and division *DNA transcription and DNA repair *Differentiation and development *Immune response and inflammation *Neural and muscular degeneration *Morphogenesis of neural networks *Modulation of cell surface receptors, ion channels and the secretory pathway *Response to stress and extracellular modulators *Ribosome biogenesis *Viral infection Localisation The ubiquitin-associated (UBA) protein domain is found to be localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Structure UBA domains are a commonly occurring sequence motif of approximately 45 amino acid residues. Examples The human homologue of yeast Rad23A is one example of a nucleotide excision-repair protein that contains both an internal and a C-terminal UBA domain. The solution structure of human Rad23A UBA(2) showed that the domain forms a compact three-helix bundle. Comparison of the structures of UBA(1) and UBA(2) reveals that both form very similar folds and have a conserved large hydrophobic surface patch which may be a common protein-interacting surface present in diverse UBA domains. Evidence that ubiquitin binds to UBA domains leads to the prediction that the hydrophobic surface patch of UBA domains interacts with the hydrophobic surface on the five-stranded beta-sheet of ubiquitin. This domain is similar in sequence to the N-terminal domain of translation elongation factor EF1B (or EF-Ts) from bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. More information about EF1B (EF-Ts) proteins can be found at Protein of the Month: Elongation Factors.

The bus was carrying 42 Israelis, mainly youths, from the airport to their hotels, after arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv. The explosion killed the Bulgarian bus driver and five Israelis–ê—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ç—ä—Ç –≤ –ë—É—Ä–≥–∞—Å –ø–æ—á–µ—Ä–Ω–∏ –∏ –Æ—Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–æ and injured 32 Israelis, resulting in international condemnation of the bombing. In February 2013, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, the Bulgarian Interior Minister, said there was \\"well-grounded\\" evidence that Hezbollah was behind the attack. Tsvetanov stated that the two suspects had Canadian and Australian passports and lived in Lebanon. According to the Europol, forensic evidence and intelligence sources all point to Hezbollah's involvement in the blast. Both Iran and Hezbollah have denied any involvement. On 5 June 2013, new Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister Kristian Vigenin stated that: \\"There is no conclusive evidence for the implication of Hezbollah in the July 2012 bombing in Burgas. The authorities continue to gather evidence.\\"http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=150984 However, two weeks later a Bulgarian representative to the European Union revealed that investigators discovered new evidence that implicates Hezbollah operatives were connected to the terrorist attacks. Investigators found that the forged documents used by the perpetrators of the attack were facilitated by a man with ties to Hezbollah. In July 2013, the newly appointed Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev stated: \\"there are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing.\\"Hezbollah behind bombings On 25 July 2013, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry released photographs of two Hezbollah operatives suspected in the bombing: Australian citizen Malid Farah (also known as \\"Hussein Hussein\\"), and Canadian citizen Hassan al-Haj.Photos of Burgas attack suspects released ‚Äì Ynetnews (25 July 2013) In 2013, and partly in response to the bombing, the EU unanimously voted to list the military branch of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. On 18 July 2014, Bulgaria announced that they identified the bomber as a dual Lebanese-French citizen named Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini. Attack Seven people (including the suicide bomber) were killed and at least thirty-two injured in an explosion on an Israeli-operated tour bus at the Burgas Airport in the Black Sea city of Burgas, with a population of some 200,000 people and approximately 400 kilometers (250 mi) east of the capital, Sofia. In addition, two other buses were damaged in the blast.Bulgaria says Israelis killed by suicide attacker by Veselin Toshkov Associated Press 19 July 2012 Bulgarian leaders, including President Rosen Plevneliev, rushed to the site. The Foreign Ministry said authorities believed that the blast was a terrorist attack. According to the initial reports of Bulgarian authorities, the blast was caused by a bomb in a luggage compartment. However, it was later argued by a Bulgarian official that the blast was probably carried out by a male suicide bomber with fake US documents. An 11-year-old child and two pregnant women were among the injured, while another pregnant woman was killed. Mustafa Kyosev, the Bulgarian bus driver, was also killed at the age of 36. Survivors of the attack described people being thrown into the air, people shouting and crying, and recalled seeing body parts. The witnesses said that the explosion began at the front of the bus and sent fire down through the vehicle. Some passengers on the bus jumped out of windows to escape. Two days after the attack, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said that the bomb was carried in the backpack of a man who was filmed on security cameras at the airport. Tsvetanov added that the bomb was detonated in the luggage compartment of the bus, and that the blast was caused by 3 kilograms of TNT powder. In 2020, however, the bomb was identified as an ammonium nitrate-based device. =Fatalities= {  * Maor Harush (24) Acre‚ÄîIsraeli tourist * Itzik Kolangi (28) Petah Tikva, Israel‚ÄîIsraeli tourist * Mustafa Kyosov (36) Yurukovo, Bulgaria‚ÄîBus driver  * Amir Menashe (28) Petah Tikva, Israel‚ÄîIsraeli tourist * Elior Preiss (25) Acre, Israel ‚ÄîIsraeli tourist * Kochava Shriki (42, pregnant) Rishon LeZion, Israel‚ÄîIsraeli tourist  * Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini (25) France‚ÄîThe bomber, dual Lebanese-French citizenship } Perpetrator investigations Following the attack, a probe was launched to determine who was responsible for the attack. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said that the investigation might take years. On 12 August, a probe into the attack concluded that the perpetrator was a suicide bomber, which disproved other possible theories, such as being a deluded drug smuggler. On 17 August, Tsvetanov said that the probe indicated that a country or terrorist organization was responsible for the bus bombing, but did not name any suspects. =Description= On 19 July, Tsvetanov stated that the suspected attacker is seen on security camera tape near the bus for about an hour before the blast and that he had a fake driver's license from the U.S. state of Michigan. The suspected bomber was described as a white male with long hair and wearing glasses.Kulish, Nicholas & Brunwasser, Matthew. Suicide Attacker With Fake U.S. ID Blamed in Bus Bomb The New York Times. Retrieved 19 July 2012. Sketch released by Bulgarian authorities of a man who is believed to be either an accomplice or the bomber Burgas prosecutor Kalina Tchapkanova quoted witnesses who said that the perpetrator \\"spoke English with a slight accent\\" and appeared to be Arab, while the wife of the owner of a car rental service said she was sure that the perpetrator was of Arab origin, and that he had a shaved head. The Bulgarian prosecutors said that the attacker had short hair, as opposed to the long hair seen in footage captured by a security camera at the airport, while a witness said that the perpetrator appeared to be wearing a wig. Other witnesses said that they saw the perpetrator speaking to tourists at local beaches in the days prior to the attack, and one witness said that the man told a group of tourists that his mother was Dutch and his father was Iranian. On 24 July, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that a sophisticated group of conspirators who spent at least a month in Bulgaria before the bombing were responsible for the terrorist attack, confirming suspicions that the perpetrator was not alone. Prime Minister Borisov said that those involved in the bombing used leased vehicles and moved in different cities so they wouldn't be seen together. He added that the perpetrators were \\"exceptionally skilled\\" and that they operated under \\"strict conspiracy rules.\\" Prime Minister Borisov said that officials believe he might have flown into Bulgaria from a European country in the Schengen passport-free travel zone, of which Bulgaria is not yet a member, and Bulgaria is exploring that lead with officials in other European countries. Prime Minister Borisov added that DNA samples from the suicide bomber was shared with all partner security services, but no match has been found yet in their databases. European security officials also said that images of the suicide bomber have not yet matched any of their databases, but it's possible the suicide bomber was not on a watch list. On 5 February 2013, it was reported that the suspect was a dual Canadian-Lebanese national living in Lebanon. On 18 July 2014, Bulgaria announced that they had identified the bomber as 25-year-old Lebanese-French citizen Mohamad Hassan El-Husseini through DNA testing. =Accomplices= On 16 August, the Bulgarian authorities released a computer-generated image of a suspected accomplice, saying that \\"There is data that the man is related to the terrorist attack at the airport.\\" The authorities thought it belonged to the suicide bomber, but a facial reconstruction determined that this was not the case, and raised the possibility of an accomplice. The authorities said that the suspected accomplice may have used various aliases while planning the terrorist attack, and used a fake driving license registered to \\"Ralph William Rico\\" from Grand Rapids, Michigan. The alleged accomplice in the terrorist attack On 21 August, a man from Plovdiv, a southern Bulgarian, said that he recognized the suspected accomplice, who he said he worked with for five years, and said that the accomplice is a Bulgarian who has been involved with people who preach Islamic extremism. A report in the Bulgarian press reported that the Bulgarian police are investigating this lead as well. In late August, on behalf of the Bulgarian government, Interpol attempted to recruit the help of member nations to identify one of the suspects in the investigation, and posted on its website an image of the alleged accomplice, urging anyone who had information about his identity to notify the authorities. The posted images include a copy of the fake driver's license in which the suspect seems to be wearing a wig. Interpol described the suspect as having possible Middle Eastern origin, 1.70‚Äì1.75 meters tall, and dark brown hair and eyes, who speaks English with an accent. In October, Tsvetanov announced that the terrorist responsible for the attack had a maximum of five accomplices, all of which were foreign, and that the terrorist attack was plotted outside of Bulgaria for a year and a half. =Hezbollah and Iran= Immediately following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of carrying out the attack with the backing of Iran. Netanyahu vowed that Israel would \\"react firmly [to this] global Iranian terror onslaught\\"; Israeli President Shimon Peres promised retaliation against 'Iranian terrorist sites' around the world. Iran denied responsibility for the act. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected Netanyahu's accusation that the bombing was carried out by Hezbollah as a proxy for Iran as \\"baseless.\\" On 19 July, The New York Times reported that United States officials identified the suicide bomber as a member of Hezbollah. An unnamed senior official told The New York Times that the bomber had a fake Michigan driver's license, but there are no indications that he had any connection to the United States. He added that the attacker was \\"acting under broad guidance\\" to hit Israeli targets when opportunities presented themselves and that this guidance was given to Hezbollah from Iran, which uses Hezbollah as a proxy. Two other anonymous officials added that Hezbollah was behind the bombing, although declined to offer further information. One of the officials interviewed declined to describe what specific intelligence led to the belief that the bomber was from Hezbollah. Although Iran has repeatedly denied supporting militant attacks abroad, a report by the New York City Police Department's intelligence analysts said that the suicide bombing in Burgas was the second plot unmasked there this year that is suspected to be perpetrated by Hezbollah and/or Iran. The report linked nine plots in 2012 in various countries to Iran or its proxies. That same day, Tsvetanov denied media reports that it was a local Hezbollah cell, saying that the possibility was not discussed. He added that the bomber was a foreign national who had been in the country for a minimum of four days, and was not Bulgarian, and also that investigators were following several leads, including that there was an accomplice. However, according to Vladimir Shopov, a political scientist at the New Bulgarian University, \\"For small Bulgaria to come out and openly name Hezbollah in such a way is as good as entering a minefield. There would have to be absolute certainty almost.\\" On 31 July, a member of the Bulgarian security establishment told The New York Times that there was a \\"clear direction that points to Hezbollah,\\" in the pattern as well as evidence of the attack. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated, \\"It is certainly the case that Hezbollah and Iran have been bad actors, as a general matter, but we're not, at this point, in a position to make a statement about responsibility.\\" The Pentagon has said that there were \\"distinctive Hezbollah markings\\" linked to the attack in Burgas, although at the time they could not \\"decisively state\\" who was responsible for the attack. On 9 August, The New York Times reported that in the two months leading up to the terrorist attack, Israel's intelligence services intercepted numerous phone calls between Burgas and Lebanon, which increased significantly three days prior to the bombing. An Israeli official said, \\"We know the sources in Lebanon, though not the identity of those on the other end in Bulgaria.\\" The New York Times also said that American and Bulgarian officials support Israel's assessment of the record, but won't announce that publicly. The newspaper also reported that a German intelligence official said there was skepticism regarding Hezbollah's involvement in the terrorist attack, and it is more likely that operatives with some connection to Hezbollah were used by Iran.Report: Israel finds unusually high number of Lebanon, Burgas phone calls made before attack. By Barak Ravid, Haaretz. 9 August 2012 On 28 August, Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhuriya reported that Bulgaria is \\"leaning toward\\" blaming Hezbollah for the terrorist attack. Iran has denied responsibility for the attack. After Bulgaria's centre-right wing government was replaced by a Social Democratic-led one, the certainty about the charges were diminished.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local- News/2013/Jun-05/219519-bulgaria-now-says-hezbollahs-role-in-bus-bombing- unproven.ashx#axzz2VKnamuZG =Base of Jihad= On 21 July, an unknown group called \\"Base of Jihad\\" claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement that appeared on a Lebanese news site. However, a spokesman for Bulgaria's foreign ministry denied that the group was responsible. =Mehdi Ghezali= A few days after the attack, Bulgarian news sources published information alleging that the bomber was a Swedish citizen and former captive at Guant√°namo Bay, Mehdi Ghezali. Swedish and Bulgarian authorities denied that these reports were correct, and United States officials said there was no evidence supporting the reports that Ghezali was responsible. In early October 2012, the Bulgarian daily 24 Chasa gained access to an interview with a radical Salafi militant leader, Omar Bakri, who said that he recognized the suspect as being Mehdi Ghezali. After reports surfaced linking Ghezali to the attack, Bakri said that he called \\"my brothers in Great Britain\\" to determine the identity of the man, who told him that it was Mehdi Ghezali. In addition, Bakri said that his radical organization, Al-Muhajiroun, intended on paying damages to Mustafa Kyosov, the Muslim bus driver who was killed during the attack, but decided against this, because \\"Muslims are warned not to hang around near Jews if they don't want to get hurt.\\" Bakri also alleged that Bulgaria and Eastern Europe was considered Islamic territory. = Conviction = In September 2020, a Bulgarian court sentenced in absentia two men to life in prison in connection with the bombing. The first was Meliad Farah, dual Lebanese-Austrialian National, while the second was Hassan El Hajj Hassan, a dual Lebanese-Canadian national. The whereabouts of both men were unknown and because of this they were placed on an Interpol red notice. Reactions The terrorist attack in Burgas was denounced by governments and supranational organizations worldwide. Bulgaria's EU Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva expressed her shock and sadness; Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and conveyed his condolences over the attack; Foreign Minister Nickolay Mladenov condemned the attack but said that it would be a mistake to prematurely jump to conclusions. The Bulgarian Parliament unanimously adopted a declaration the day after the attack which condemned the terror attack, and urged the relevant authorities to take all measures in order to catch and bring to justice the perpetrators of the attack. The office of the Chief Mufti, Bulgaria's principal Muslim leader, condemned the terrorist attack and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims. The office excluded \\"the possibility that such people are Muslims.\\" Across the globe, foreign governments offered support and solidarity to the citizens and authorities of Bulgaria and Israel, and expressed their condolences for the victims. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack in \\"the strongest possible terms\\" and expressed his condolences, and the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the attack in Burgas as a terrorist attack and expressed its condolences as well. Aftermath After the attack, Sarafovo Airport was closed and flights were redirected to the airport of Varna. Israel's airline El Al canceled its flight from Tel Aviv to Sofia, which was supposed to leave at 16:00 GMT. A military service was held in honor of the victims at Ben Gurion International Airport. Two days after the attack, Israel's Mossad and Shin Bet agencies had teams on the ground in Bulgaria to assist the authorities in identifying the perpetrator. Interpol sent a team of experts to Bulgaria to investigate the terrorist attack. Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said that the information concerning the fake U.S. ID papers that the perpetrator used could be indispensable and of great value if it is found in Interpol's database. The Israeli Air Force sent a C-130 Hercules transport plane to Sarafovo Airport, where it picked up 32 of the wounded and took them to Israel for treatment. A second Israeli C-130 landed in Sofia, carrying Magen David Adom specialists to evaluate the remaining wounded, and to judge whether it was safe to fly them home. The mission included military medical personnel, members of Unit 669, Home Front Command officers, along with a cadre of IDF officers. ZAKA personnel were also sent to Bulgaria to properly identify the bodies. At Ben-Gurion International Airport, 24 ambulances and medical were deployed to ensure that the injured could be swiftly transferred to local hospitals upon arrival. The Washington Posts editorial page on 20 July contained an editorial headline \\"Holding Iran accountable for terrorist attacks,\\" in which The Washington Post said that Iran must suffer for its acts of global terrorism, and \\"The Security Council should review the abundant evidence of involvement by the Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah in this year's attacks and punish both those groups as well as the Iranian government with sanctions.\\" The newspaper wrote \\"Using the territory of countries across the world, working sometimes through proxies like Lebanon's Hezbollah and sometimes with its own forces, Tehran has been intentionally targeting not just diplomats of enemies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia but also civilians.\\" In August, it was reported that Greek police fear a similar attack on Israeli tourists ahead of Israeli President Shimon Peres' visit to Greece. According to the report, police have raised the alert level and Greek intelligence is in constant contact with the Mossad. =Bulgarian and Israeli security= Around 70 Israelis who escaped the attack were immediately flown home on a Bulgarian plane. Mayor Yordanka Fandakova of Sofia ordered a stronger police presence at all public places linked to the Jewish community, which numbers about 5,000. The day after the attack, Israel boosted security at El Al airport counters and around embassies across the globe, whilst flight delays of up to 5‚Äì6 hours were reported at Ben-Gurion Airport. Mossad and Shin Bet officials convened a meeting on the same day to discuss future coordination and to assess the threat level in various countries throughout the world. On 22 July, Mossad Director Tamir Pardo and Shin Bet (Internal Security Agency) Director Yoram Cohen briefed the Israeli Cabinet on the intelligence agencies' actions against terrorism perpetrated by or planned by Iran and Hezbollah around the world according to the intelligence agencies' assessment. Pardo and Cohen said that Iran and Hezbollah have attempted to perpetrate terrorist attacks in over 20 countries in the two years prior to the attack. In September 2012, it was reported that Israeli Mossad agents and Bulgarian national security agents (SANS) are working together ahead of the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashana, which falls on Saint Sofia Day in 2012, to enhance security in and around synagogues, hotels, and churches. Intelligence agents will oversee traffic at airports in Sofia and Burgas as well. Although Israel's Counter Terrorism Bureau didn't issue a travel advisory to Bulgaria, it did ask authorities in Bulgaria, Thailand, Greece, and Cyprus to boost security around Israeli tourists ahead of the Jewish High Holidays. =Humanitarian relief efforts= Magen David Adom, Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance, and blood bank service, sent delegations to Bulgaria to help treat the wounded. The first delegation arrived on the night of the attack. The next morning, two Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft landed in Burgas in order to airlift the Israelis injured in Wednesday's terror attack back to Israel. Bulgaria's youngest-ever parliamentarian, Kalina Krumova who is 27 years old, rushed to the hospital in jeans and sandals where the injured were being treated, and stayed there during the entire night alongside the Israeli aid teams. She assisted in translations for the aid teams and in communicating with the injured, since many of the hospital staff did not speak English. Professor Gabi Barbash, head of the Israeli rescue mission, said, \\"Without her, we would have been deaf and dumb.\\" In the afternoon of the day after the attack, a military plane safely returned the 32 Israelis who were wounded to Israel. That night, a C-130 that was sent to Sofia returned to Israel with three Israelis who suffered serious injuries during the attack. =Bulgaria‚ÄìIsrael relations= Noah Gal Gendler, a former Israeli ambassador to Bulgaria, said that relations between Israel and Bulgaria are extremely good at present, and the attack won't change this. Gal-Gendler said that the Bulgarian authorities are horrified and in shock. In an effort to keep tourism ties strong between Bulgaria and Israel following the terrorist attack, Israeli tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov traveled to Bulgaria with a delegation of prominent members of Israel's tourism sector and met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Rosen Plevneliev. At a press conference, Misezhnikov, Borisov, and Plevneliev announced that the two countries would strengthen their strategic cooperation in tourism and security. Misezhnikov also held a memorial ceremony at the site of the bombing. Misezhnikov stressed that \\"Terrorism will not disrupt our lives and stop our aspirations,\\" and encouraged Israelis to keep traveling, saying that \\"tourism is a bridge to peace.\\" He also thanked the Bulgarian government for its cooperation and its \\"dedicated treatment following the tragic terror attack.\\" On 25 August, Bulgarian Energy and Economy Minister Delyan Dobrev said that the flow of tourists to Bulgaria from Israel returned to normal, despite the terrorist attack causing a temporary decrease. Dobrev announced that 28 charter flights from Israel had arrived in Bulgaria a week before his announcement, indicating that the flow of tourists had been fully restored. Dobrev also suggested that this restoration was the result of Miszhnikov's visit to Bulgaria, as well as a promotional campaign for Bulgaria by four of Israel's largest print edition and interviews on local TV channels. In order to demonstrate unity following the terrorist attack, the Israeli and Bulgarian governments met in Israel at Jerusalem in September 2012. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, along with 12 out of 16 ministers, visited Israel for a joint meeting between the two governments. In addition, Borissov held one- on-one meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Shimon Peres. In another meeting in October 2012, Israeli President Shimon Peres praised Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev and Foreign Minister Nikolay Mladenov's response to the terrorist attack, while Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin invited the family of the slain bus driver to Israel. Peres thanked Bulgaria for saving Jews during the Holocaust and for continuing to support Israel after the terrorist attack. Plevneliev said that \\"together, Israel and Bulgaria will fight terror and evil.\\" Bulgarian ceremony In late August 2012, Bulgaria held a remembrance ceremony in honor of the victims of the terrorist attack. Two ceremonies were held, one in Sofia's largest synagogue, which prepared a curation of the ark that contained the names of the victims, and another ceremony was held in Burgas. Israeli groups were accompanied by guards and police canine units, and security was tight. Many families of the victims of the attack took part in the ceremony, and met with Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, and Bulgarian Minister of Tourism Dlyan Dobrev, and were also hosted at the Israeli Ambassador to Bulgaria Shaul Kamisa's house. At the ceremony, the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) said that it would include the family of Mustafa Kyosov, the Muslim bus driver who was killed in the attack, among recipients of aid from the Fund for the Victims of Terror. The $1,500 grant was given to the Kyosovs in order to \\"ease their financial struggles and show the solidarity of the Jewish people with their loss.\\" Former Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon spoke at the ceremony as well, saying that: > Dozens were injured simply because they were Jews and Israelis. Every victim > represents an entire world, a life story cut short, dreams that will not be > fulfilled. Terrorism does not distinguish between blood and blood, and from > person to person. Killers try to reach any place in the world to attack > innocent Jews and Israelis, and would not hesitate to kill anyone who stood > in their way when they implement their actions.\\" > Blood-curdling terrorists do not distinguish between the blood of one person > or another. These killers try to attack innocent Jews and Israelis, and they > will travel to any part of the world, and kill anyone who stands in their > way, in order to do so. [We will] hunt down the perpetrators of this > disgusting terror act by any means necessary...and pursue them to the bitter > end.

Richardson (born June 10, 1954) is an American Harvard-trained lawyer and the founder and executive director of The HistoryMakers, a national, 501(c)(3) non-profit educational institution based in Chicago, Illinois, committed to preserving, developing, and providing easy access to an internationally recognized archival collection of thousands of African- American video oral histories. With more than 2,000 life oral history interviews with well-known and unsung African Americans, The HistoryMakers is the nation's largest African-American oral history collection of its kind. Before founding The HistoryMakers in 1999, Richardson was a successful cable television executive and corporate lawyer. She was the founder and CEO of both SCTN Teleproductions, which served as the local production arm for C-SPAN, and Shop Chicago Inc., which set standards for regional TV home-shopping ventures and received international attention with its combination of home shopping and infomercial formats. Richardson resides in Chicago. Early life and education Julieanna Richardson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to mother, Margaret Richardson, and father, Julius Richardson. She is the oldest of four sisters. She spent her early life in the mill town of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, about 12 miles outside of Pittsburgh, where she lived with her mother and her mother's mother while her father was away serving in the Army. Richardson's father, Julius, had wanted to be a lawyer, but stayed in the military to support his growing family. Richardson attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan for high school, and in 1976 received her B.A. degree in Theater Arts and American Studies from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where she graduated magna cum laude. During her junior year at Brandeis University, Richardson benefited from the opportunity to serve as a visiting student at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England. It was also during her studies at Brandeis University that Richardson first experienced the power of oral history, while conducting independent research on the Harlem Renaissance and poet and author Langston Hughes that culminated in her senior honors thesis \\"It's all i got: Langston Hughes's reconciliation of black and American identities\\". In 1980, Richardson received her J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Career =Legal career= Richardson's first job after graduating from Harvard Law School was with the Chicago law firm of Jenner & Block, where she worked on both corporate and commercial matters with an emphasis on corporate, banking, and copyright law. =Television career= In the 1982, Richardson served as the City's Assistant and later Chief Cable Administrator for the City of Chicago's Office of Cable Communications, where she established the Chicago Cable Commission, the City's regulatory body. In 1985, Richardson founded Shop Chicago, a first-of-its-kind regionally based home-shopping channel reaching 750,000 cable households in the Chicago market and featuring local vendors and retail establishments. Shop Chicago set standards for regional TV home- shopping ventures and received international attention with its combination of home shopping and infomercial formats. Other investors in the television home- shopping service included William Bartholomay, vice chairman of Frank B. Hall & Co. and vice chairman of Turner Broadcasting System; Jerold Solovy, a partner at Jenner & Block; and Patricia Koldyke. Richardson then started her own production company, SCTN Teleproductions, specializing in corporate videos, cable TV programming and new media. For eight years, SCTN managed three local cable channels for TCI, then the nation's largest cable operator. SCTN Teleproductions served as the local production arm for C-SPAN. =The HistoryMakers= In February 2000, she conducted her first interview, with the black radio executive Barry Mayo. Other subjects followed, many of them well known: Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Julian Bond. But an encounter with William Thompson, a veteran of World War II's all-black Tuskegee Airmen, convinced Richardson that the HistoryMakers was about more than just celebrities. When they met, Thompson told Richardson about the Golden 13, the thirteen black men commissioned as officers by the navy during World War II. What is more, he told Richardson that one of those men ‚Äî William Sylvester White, then a judge with the appellate court in Chicago ‚Äî was waiting upstairs. Richardson ended up interviewing both men, who have since died. \\"It was one of those moments when I knew I was on the right path,\\" says Richardson. \\"It wasn't about names, but about finding history in places where people didn't know history existed.\\" Since its founding, Richardson has led the HistoryMakers on an ambitious path to record 5,000 video oral history interviews, a goal she acknowledges is strongly dependent on funding. Working out of their Chicago office, Richardson and her staff have recorded more than 2,000 interviews (8,000 hours of footage) with both well-known and unsung African Americans, including General Colin Powell, Angela Davis, Julian Bond, Russell Simmons, Benjamin Carson, Harry Belafonte, Ernie Banks, Gwen Ifill, Maya Angelou, and President Barack Obama when he was an Illinois State Senator. The archive also includes lesser- known African Americans who have been successful in a variety of ways, such as Myrtis Dightman, the first black cowboy to qualify for the Professional Rodeo Association National Finals, Geraldine Johnson, the first African-American woman to be Superintendent of Schools in Connecticut, and Ludie Jones, a tap dancer famous for her performances during the prohibition era. Richardson serves as the Executive Director of The HistoryMakers as well as president of the History Makers National Board of Directors. As Executive Director, she has also produced a plethora of successful public programs and special events, including the HistoryMakers' annual signature PBS-TV Celebrity interview and fundraiser, \\"An Evening With...\\". \\"An Evening With...\\" has featured interviews with notable African Americans, including Eartha Kitt, John Rogers, Smokey Robinson, Quincy Jones, Valerie Simpson, Colin Powell, and Andrew Young among others. The annual program is aired on PBS-TV nationwide. Among the organization's many achievements under Richardson's leadership are the production of an educational video, CD-ROM and curriculum guide, called Pioneers in the Struggle: A History of African Americans in the Illinois General Assembly, 1877-2001, which was distributed to schools, grades 8‚Äì12, across the state of Illinois, winning a $2.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to interview 180 African-American scientists, and being awarded an $800,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to run a fellowship program focusing on increasing diversity in the archival profession. In 2004, the HistoryMakers received a grant from the IMLS to create a unique digital archive in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University. The digital archive, which went live in 2006, includes more than 310 interviews (800 hours of footage) and has 3,500 users from 51 countries. Honors Richardson has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards. She currently sits on the Honors Council of Lawyers for the Creative Arts and she was appointed in 2011 to the Comcast NBCUniversal African American Diversity Council. In May 2012, she received an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Howard University during the school's 144th Commencement Convocation.

Prior to that time, both airports were owned and operated by the FAA. Area served The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Fire and Rescue Department serves as the primary responders for the fire, rescue, and EMS response for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport as well as portions of Virginia State Route 267 consisting of parts of the Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Airport Access Highway adjacent to the airport. They also respond through mutual aid agreements to protect a larger service area that includes Arlington County, City of Alexandria, Loudoun County, Fairfax County, Washington D.C., and other surrounding counties within the Washington, D.C.

The two aircraft collided mid-air, killing all 51 passengers and 4 crewmembers on board and leaving the P-38 pilot with serious injuries. =Transpo '72= The world's largest airshow of the time was held over a period of 9 days at Dulles Airport from May 27-June 4 of 1972, nicknamed Transpo '72. The event included all forms of transportation, including high speed rail demos and jumbo jets of the time. During the air show events, three separate fatal incidents occurred. The first involved a hang glider kite accident killing the pilot. The second incident during an aircraft race when a sport pilot crashed into a pylon and careened into the woods on the far side of the airstrip from the spectators killing him. The last incident was the first fatal accident for the United States Air Force Thunderbirds when Major Joe Howard lost power while flying his McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and ejected successfully from the crash. However, Maj. Howard was blown into the fireball from the crash, causing his parachute to melt and Maj. Howard to receive fatal injuries from the fall. =Air Florida Flight 90= On January 13, 1982 Air Florida Flight 90, a Boeing 737, clipped the 14th Street Bridge before crashing into the Potomac River shortly after takeoff from National Airport. Of the 74 passengers and 5 crew members on board, only 4 passengers and 1 flight attendant survived the crash. In addition, due to heavy traffic on the bridge at the time from a snow storm impacting the region, four motorists in vehicles on the bridge were killed. The snow storm, and traffic congestion were noted to delay response and impede access of response resources throughout the region. Due to the deficiencies noted in the response in icy waters, the department improved their River Rescue capabilities with airboats capable of operating on surface ice of the river. =9/11= On September 11, 2001, a team of five al-Qaeda affiliated hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 77, en route from Dulles International to Los Angeles International Airport, and deliberately crashed it into The Pentagon at 9:37 a.m. EDT as part of the September 11 attacks. All 64 people on the airliner were killed as were 125 people who were in the building. The impact of the plane severely damaged the structure of the building and caused its partial collapse. The MWAA Fire & Rescue Department units from Fire Station 301 were among the first units on scene at the Pentagon, and staff & equipment from both airports operated at the incident scene for several days past the initial incident operations.

Named after the singer's album Born This Way (2011), the Foundation is committed to supporting the wellness of young people and working with them to \\"make the world kinder and braver\\". The Foundation prioritizes the mental health and wellness of young people by working to promote kindness and open and honest conversations about mental health, validating the emotions of young people, and eradicating the stigma around mental health. Furthermore, the Foundation works to \\"connect, engage, and inspire young people ‚Äî on the road, in their communities, and online\\". The Foundation's programs focus on modeling healthy conversations about mental wellness, connecting youth with resources and services, and fostering communities that prioritize mental health. Background In the documentary ‚ÄúInside the Outside,‚Äù Lady Gaga talked about being bullied herself and thrown in a trash can while classmates looked on. Lady Gaga often shares her personal experiences with the public, and has always hoped to ‚Äúestablish a standard of Bravery and Kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others in the face of bullying and abandonment. She and her mother started BTWF to work with young people and provide the skills and opportunities they need to build a kinder and braver world. When Lady Gaga launched the Foundation with her mother in 2012, she stated to the Washington Post, ‚ÄúTogether we hope to establish a standard of Bravery and Kindness, as well as a community worldwide that protects and nurtures others‚Ä¶‚Äù In a PBS interview, Cynthia Germanotta stated that Lady Gaga was bullied at an early age and subsequently developed anxiety and depression, struggling with mental illness throughout college. As her career took off, she talked openly about her mental health challenges and the importance of kindness. In 2016, Lady Gaga discussed the importance of kindness and compassion at the 84 Annual U.S. Conference of Mayors in Indianapolis. She joined the 14th Dalai Lama at the event to talk about building \\"compassionate cities\\" around the country. During her speech, Gaga told city representatives, \\"Kindness is a free currency from a well that will never dry up,\\" and, \\"The most efficient way for you to act with young people is to be a calming force.\\" Cynthia Germanotta told PBS in 2018 that the Foundation was ‚Äúbuilt out of a lifelong passion to help young people. Our mission has always been to build a kinder and braver world ‚Ä¶ By creating safe communities for young people and offering skills and opportunities to empower them and inspire them...‚Äù In doing so, the Foundation focuses on promoting kindness, creating positive environments, and encouraging mental wellness among youth. Executive Director Maya Enista Smith additionally stated that the Foundation exists ‚Äúto help eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health and equip young people to have those conversations that lead to that destigmatization.‚Äù In October 2018, Lady Gaga was named as one of ELLE's Women in Hollywood honorees. During her acceptance speech, she encouraged everyone to ‚Äúwork together to beckon the world towards kindness‚Äù and opened up about the PTSD she developed after she was assaulted at age 19. She additionally advocated for stronger mental health resources, stating she wanted to see mental health become a ‚Äúglobal priority.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is my personal dream that there would be a mental health expert teacher or therapist in every school in this nation and hopefully, one day, around the world,‚Äù Lady Gaga said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs lift our voices. I know we are, but let‚Äôs get louder. And not just as women. But as humans.‚Äù In November 2018, Lady Gaga accepted the SAG- AFTRA Foundation's Artists Inspiration Award, and in a 25-minute speech shared her own mental health struggles, advocated for stronger mental health resources in the industry by requesting SAG-AFTRA partner with the Foundation, and encouraged people to share their mental health stories. ‚ÄúWhen I speak about mental health, even or especially when I‚Äôm speaking about mine, it is often met with quietness, or maybe a somber line of fans waiting outside to whisper to me in the shadows about their darkest secrets,‚Äù she said in her acceptance speech. ‚ÄúWe need to bring mental health into the light. We need to share our stories so that global mental health no longer resides and festers in the darkness.‚Äù She additionally encouraged everyone to ‚Äúlive in a culture of kindness through our individual acts and take back what determines our future.‚Äù History Lady Gaga's signatureThe organization was launched on February 29, 2012 by artist Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, who said, \\"challenge meanness and cruelty by inspiring young people to create a support system in their respective communities.\\" Media proprietor Oprah Winfrey, writer Deepak Chopra, and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the inauguration. The Foundation's original funding included $1.2 million from Lady Gaga, $500,000 from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and $850,000 from retailer Barneys New York. BTWF was the beneficiary of Barneys New York's 2011 holiday campaign which also featured \\"Lady Gaga‚Äôs Workshop.\\" In May 2012, Viacom announced it would be the Foundation's lead media partner for the development of events, programming and \\"opportunities that empower young people to build a braver, kinder world.\\" In August 2012, Lady Gaga was named by American business magazine Forbes, well known for its lists (richest Americans ‚Äì the Forbes 400, Forbes list of billionaires, etc.), as fourteenth on their \\"World's 100 Most Powerful Women\\" list due in part to her BTWF work. In 2018, Born This Way Foundation was the recipient of Girls Inc.‚Äôs Champion For Girls Award and the Children Mending Heart‚Äôs ‚ÄúGlobal Changemakers‚Äù Award. That same year, Co- founder of the Foundation Cynthia Germanotta was additionally invited to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the organization to discuss mental health and launch a new ‚ÄúUnited for Global Mental Health‚Äù initiative. In March 2014, Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 criticized the Foundation's spendings reflected in their federal tax reports. The reports noted spending of $348,000 on its Born Brave Bus tour; approximately $1.5 million on fees related to Web and social media, publicity, and legalities, as opposed to only $5,000 in grants to individuals and other organizations. \\"It‚Äôs unclear that anyone was really helped by the Born This Way Foundation other than lawyers, consultants, publicists and travel agents,\\" Friedman wrote. \\"We do the work,\\" Lady Gaga wrote in response. \\"We do not raise money and allocate the funds to other charities for them to do the work.‚Äù ‚ÄúA clear understanding of the differences between a grant-making organization and one that carries out its work directly would have made this a non-story,\\" Cynthia Germanotta added. \\"We are not a grant-maker that funds the work of other charities, and were never intended to be ... [But] we are having a profound impact in just a very short period of time.‚Äù  Programming and Campaigns  = Channel Kindness = On September 15, 2016, Born This Way Foundation launched a new program called Channel Kindness, that is designed ‚Äúto give youth a voice in a media landscape that too often ignores or misrepresents young people.‚Äù In creating this program, Born This Way Foundation recognized the absence of positive stories in today's media. Channel Kindness is designed to fill that void and provide individuals across the globe with some much-needed optimism and encouragement. From 2017‚Äì2018, the program recruited and trained 100 youth reporters ages 15‚Äì24 from across the United States to recognize and broadcast acts of kindness they saw in their everyday lives and communities. Their stories are published on ChannelKindness.org and are spread across the program's social media channels. In 2018, Born This Way Foundation announced it would expand Channel Kindness, which is now open to anyone from across the U.S. and, for the first time, around the world to share their stories on the platform.  #MultiplyYourGood  In honor of World Kindness Day in 2018, Born This Way Foundation announced the launch of the #MultiplyYourGood Channel Kindness Challenge. With support from Zappos, the campaign called on individuals to celebrate their power to make a difference by volunteering or donating to a nonprofit in their community. For every act of good performed during the challenge, Born This Way Foundation pledged to ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù it by performing an act of good for one of the organization's nonprofit partners. The Foundation's diverse network of partners, including SoulCycle, which invited riders to take part, and Starbucks, which hosted community events on World Kindness Day 2018 in ten stores nationwide, helped amplify the campaign. The in-store activations invited guests to participate in an activity that met the needs of a local nonprofits, such as collecting donated items or writing holiday messages for homeless youth.  #Someone2Turn2  Born This Way Foundation and United for Global Mental Health announced the launch of the #Someone2Turn2 Channel Kindness Challenge to foster healthy conversations about mental wellness in honor of World Mental Health Day on Wednesday, October 10, 2018. Inspired by the work of the Friendship Bench initiative, the #Someone2Turn2 challenged the public to have a real, honest, and open discussion about mental health with the person they turn to when they need support and then share who their #Someone2Turn2 is on social media. = #BeKind21 = #BeKind21 is an annual initiative that encourages people to do at least one kind activity a day for 21 days, starting on September 1 and extending to September 21st. Inspired by the idea that it takes 21 days to build a habit, the campaign culminated in 2018 on the U.N. International Day of Peace and inspired over 8 million acts of kindness. As part of #BeKind21, participants could take a pledge to make kindness a habit, as the campaign stems from beliefs that kindness can heal the world and when someone gives to others, they give back to their own wellness. In its second year, Born This Way Foundation reported over 7,000 sign-ups and 1.6 million participants for the #BeKind21 campaign, partnering with over 130 organizations: schools, nonprofits, and corporations. Also in 2019, those who signed up for the campaign were encouraged to form ‚ÄúKindness Teams‚Äù on which they could do kind acts as a group. The efforts of the 2019 #BeKind21 campaign resulted in over 40 million acts of kindness‚Äîup over 32 million from the year before‚Äîand it will kick off its third year on September 1, 2020. = #BeKindBeThere = #BeKindBeThere is a joint initiative between Born This Way Foundation and Jack.org to highlight Jack.org's program BeThere.org. BeThere.org aims to teach young people the skills necessary to support someone else's mental health while protecting their own. BeThere.org offers five steps, or ‚ÄúGolden Rules,‚Äù to support someone who is struggling with their mental health. These are: (1) say what you see by breaking the ice and starting a conversation, (2) show you care by building trust and supporting someone, (3) hear them out by being a good listener and balancing the conversation, (4) know your role by setting boundaries to protect your relationship and own mental health, and (5) connect to help by accessing professional and community resources. Promoted with video conversation between the two organizations and across all social media platforms with the hashtag #BeKindBeThere, these golden rules can be found in more detail on BeThere.org. = Teen Mental Health First Aid = In 2019, Born This Way Foundation partnered with the National Council for Behavioral Health to bring teen Mental Health First Aid (teenMHFA) training to the United States. teenMHFA is an in-person training designed for high school students in grades 10 to 12 ‚Äúto learn about mental illnesses, including how to identify and respond to a developing mental health or substance use problem among their peers.‚Äù The program herein is built upon the idea that, during mental health crises, teens often first turn to each other for support and guidance, rather than to structural resources. Addressing this chain of dialogue, students learn a 5-step action plan to help their friends who may be facing a mental health problem or crisis, such as suicide, and how to find and involve a responsible and trusted adult. Starting with a pilot set of eight schools across the nation, the program expanded to an additional 20 primary institutions in the fall of 2019. In June 2019, Born This Way Foundation convened a group of teens trained through teenMHFA in Las Vegas to reflect on the program. During her June 6 show of her ENIGMA residency, Lady Gaga brought the students onstage to discuss the mental wellness program with attendees. Starting in the spring of 2020, 40 additional schools were chosen to participate in the second round of Teen Mental Health First Aid training programs. This expansion brings the total number of schools participating to more than 75 schools nationwide. = Emotion Revolution Summit at Yale University = On October 24, 2015, Born This Way Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence hosted the Emotion Revolution Summit to raise awareness of how much emotions play into young people's decision-making and wellness. The event consisted of round-table discussions, workshops, and speeches from a variety of educators and advocates, including Lady Gaga herself. Lady Gaga asked the over 200 young people at the conference to focus on and care for their own mental and emotional health. She invited them to join a movement addressing the importance of emotions on social media using the hashtag #IAmNotJust. Born This Way Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence also collected data from these students and found that when students were asked how they currently feel in school, 75% of the responses were negative. = \\"What does bravery mean to you?\\" Campaign = From March 28 to April 11, 2012, the Born This Way Foundation ran a poster campaign to inspire bravery and encouraged supporters to submit images that answer the question, \\"What does bravery mean to you?\\" with the 10 semi finalists selected by Lady Gaga and her mother, and leading to a prize for the winner(s), selected by fans.  Community Activations  = The Channel Kindness Tour = From August 1, 2017, through December 18, 2017, Born This Way Foundation accompanied Lady Gaga on her Joanne World Tour, visiting over 30 cities across the US and Canada. The Channel Kindness Tour included in venues activations, which allowed local nonprofits to connect directly with concert goes; communities conversations on mental health and services events; and Channel Kindness Awards which recognized 8 youth across the country. = Share Kindness = In 2016, the Foundation joined forces with TODAY and NBC with the goal to inspire 1 million acts of kindness before the end of the year. With the hashtag #ShareKindness, people were encouraged to celebrate empathy and generosity by committing an act of kindness for someone else in their schools, homes, businesses, and communities. To help kick off #ShareKindness, Lady Gaga and her mother Cynthia Germanotta, visited the Ali Forney Center, a shelter for homeless LGBTQ+ youth in Harlem in New York City. Lady Gaga surprised the youth with gifts, encouraging messages, and led a meditation session alongside her mother. She encouraged the group with her mantra, ‚ÄúYou are brave. You are courageous,‚Äù and concluded with a strong statement of gratitude to each of the youth: ‚ÄúThank you for being alive.‚Äù Lady Gaga also emphasized the value of kindness: ‚ÄúKindness to me is an action of love or a showing of love to someone else and I also believe that kindness is the cure to violence and hatred around the world.\\" = Born Brave Bus = The Foundation announced in May 2012 that the Born Brave Bus would follow Lady Gaga on tour as an initiative to inspire bravery, empower the youth, and connect young people to resources in their community. In June 2012, \\"Born Brave\\" communities and school groups, dedicated to making a positive change where they live. Born Brave Nation, a name chosen by Born This Way Foundation supporters, requested founding members in July 2012, but the bus had not yet launched. The Foundation partnered with community organizations like Campus Pride, GLSEN, the National Association of School Psychologists and Youth Service America to connect young people to the resources in their communities.  Partnerships  = Starbucks/Cups of Kindness = In 2017, the Foundation and Starbucks teamed up to introduce the Starbucks Cups of Kindness collection: four very special drinks, the Matcha Lemonade, Violet Drink, Pink Drink, and Ombr√© Pink Drink. For each cup of kindness beverage that was purchased between June 13 and June 19, Starbucks donated $0.25 to Born This Way Foundation and the Channel Kindness project. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre healthier and happier when we live our lives with compassion, and our communities are stronger when we treat one another with generosity and respect,‚Äù Lady Gaga said when the partnership launched. ‚ÄúBorn This Way Foundation and I are so excited to partner with Starbucks to help inspire positivity and love through the Cups of Kindness collection.‚Äù On June 3, 2019, Starbucks announced it was partnering with Born This Way Foundation for Pride Month in order to fundraise for the Foundation and offer support to grassroots LGBTQ+ organizations across the United States. For the month of June, Starbucks Foundation matched any donations that were made to Born This Way Foundation up to $250,000. = United For Global Mental Health = In October 2018, the Foundation helped launch United for Global Mental Health at ‚ÄúTime to Act on Global Mental Health: Building Momentum on Mental Health in the SDG Era,‚Äù an event organized by United for Global Mental Health during the United National General Assembly. The Foundation's Co-Founder and President Cynthia Germanotta shared her personal story and helped moderate panels to help bring the topic of mental health at the forefront of the world stage. = DonorsChoose.org = Born This Way Foundation partners with DonorsChoose.org to fund mental health projects at schools across the country. The partnership has matched donations from 1,900 donors to fund these projects. Through this partnership, Born This Way Foundation and DonorsChoose.org have funded 697 projects at 416 different schools. These projects have worked to help 75,981 students and 507 teachers. The projects range from an after-school kindness club to a drawing space for students, and much more. = The National Council on Behavioral Health - Mental Health First Aid = In August 2017, Born This Way Foundation partnered with the National Council for Behavioral Health to train 150,000 people in Mental Health First Aid. Training sessions were held along the stops for Lady Gaga's Joanne world tour, as part of Born This Way Foundation's Channel Kindness Tour. Mental Health First Aid trains individuals to recognize and respond to people experiencing mental health or substance abuse crises. Born This Way Foundation continues to work with Mental Health First Aid to encourage supporters to get trained in the program. = Staples = Staples and Born This Way Foundation teamed up to create the Staples for Students Digital Kindness Tree to encourage people nationwide to promote kindness in schools and celebrate everyday acts of kindness. Consumers helped it grow by visiting www.StaplesKindnessTree.com or by Tweeting with hashtag #GrowKindness. On the website and Twitter, users had the opportunity to describe an act of kindness that they recently performed, witnessed or pledge to do. Each time an act of kindness was reported, a ‚Äúleaf‚Äù was added to the tree, which continued to grow throughout the summer with each kind act reported. = Office Depot = In 2012, Lady Gaga expressed an interest in being part of the \\"natural fabric of schooling.\\" In July 2012, BTWF partnered with the supplier of office products Office Depot to create a range of limited edition back-to-school products including: \\"empowerment gift cards\\" containing motivational messages, and \\"bravery bracelets.\\" Office Depot agreed to donate 25% of the sale value for each item sold and guaranteed US$1 million donation in 2012 to the Foundation. This led the Florida Family Association, what New York Times noted was a ‚Äúone-man Christian fundamentalist organization,‚Äù to accuse Office Depot of influencing teenagers to reject heterosexuality. In support of the efforts by Office Depot and Born This Way Foundation, public service announcement videos that highlighted the mission of the initiative were created by model and actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, and by pop singer Greyson Chance to be aired on Facebook, YouTube, and other outlets. Research The Foundation has worked with various partners to conduct and amplify research focused on youth wellness and empowerment. Below is a list of research commissioned or supported by Born This Way Foundation. =2019= Youth Mental Health in America In early 2019, the Foundation worked with the Benenson Strategy Group to survey more than 2,000 young people between the ages of 13‚Äì24 to explore how young people perceive mental health, their level of access to mental health resources, and what those resources look like. Key findings of the survey revealed that young people care about their mental health but lack access to crucial resources to support themselves. Young people shared they are unaware of where to go and the cost associated with finding mental health resources. The data showed that youth are interested in using a variety of resources to support their mental health. The survey showed that young people need more education on existing mental health resources and expanded access to these resources. = 2018 =  Mental Health Online Diaries: Understanding Child-Parent/Guardian Relationships  In early 2018, BTWF commissioned a study from the Benenson Strategy Group to conduct a series of online ethnographic diary interviews between 20 young people aged 13‚Äì24 and their parents/guardians to learn more about the family dynamics of mental health and wellness. The questions allowed researchers to further understand what makes for supportive environments and relationships and the ways in which young people and their parents/guardians feel connected or disconnected to their families and broader support network. Findings from this Mental Health Online Diaries study revealed that counter to common narratives, young people see immense value in real life relationships, parents are making an effort to talk about mental health but sometimes don't connect, and hard conversations don't happen when young people fear being judged and parents don't initiate them.  Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health and Online Behavior  With data gathered during the Kind Communities survey, the Foundation explored questions related to youth mental health and their digital habits. In addition to examining the correlation between social media use and mental wellness, the Digital Communities: Youth Mental Health and Online Behavior survey sought to better understand how youth ‚Äì including those who identify as LGBT+ ‚Äì perceive their digital communities and how they use online resources to better understand and manage their mental health. = 2017 =  Kind Communities ‚Äì A Bridge To Youth Mental Wellness  In 2017, the Foundation commissioned the ‚ÄúKind Communities ‚Äì A Bridge To Youth Mental Wellness‚Äù survey from the Benenson Strategy Group. The survey collected data from over 3,000 young people between the ages of 15-24 and over 1,000 parents, asking questions about mental health and wellness. Some of the key findings from this comprehensive study include: Young people who describe their environments as kind are more likely to be mentally healthy, youth rely on a small set of close friends for support, and young people with access to tangible resources are more mentally healthy. = 2016 =  Born Brave Experiences Research  The Born Brave Experiences Research is a series of studies focused on improving our understanding of the factors that influence youth empowerment, youth engagement, mental health, and emotional well-being. By working with partners across the country and surveying youth themselves, the research gained is used to learn how to better promote kindness and mental wellness in schools, communities, and homes. The surveys were conducted by Dr. Sue Swearer, the Willa Cather Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr. Swearer has chaired Born This Way Foundation's Research Advisory Board and led the Born Brave Experience research with assistance from Raul Palacios, Ed.S, a Doctoral Student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. = 2015 =  Emotion Revolution Survey  In 2015, the Foundation and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence partnered to launch the Emotion Revolution Survey. Collecting data from over 22,000 high school students, the survey found that when students were asked how they currently feel in school, 75% of the responses were negative. In fact, the most common responses were ‚Äútired,‚Äù ‚Äústressed,‚Äù and ‚Äúbored.‚Äù However, when students were asked how they want to feel in school, the most frequently listed emotions were overwhelmingly positive, such as ‚Äúhappy,‚Äù ‚Äúenergized,‚Äù and ‚Äúexcited.‚Äù  Additional Projects  # On October 16, 2016, toy company Mattel released the Zomby Gaga collector doll for pre-order as a part of their Monster High doll line in partnership with the BTWF. The doll is based on Gaga's Zombie Boy inspired skeleton tattoo makeup and tuxedo look from the Born This Way music video and designed by Gaga's sister Natali Germanotta together with Mattel. The doll was released on Jan 2, 2017, with all proceeds benefiting the Foundation. # White House National Conference on Mental Health - In 2013, BTWF became an official partner of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden's Empowerment Initiative to help create and continue ‚Äúa national conversation to increase understanding and awareness about mental health.‚Äù # In September 2012, Gaga launched a new project called A Body Revolution 2013 to address poor body image and body acceptance. This was done, in part, because media outlets had negatively remarked on supposed weight gains by the performer. To start the project, she posted images of herself in underwear on LittleMonsters.com and asked others to follow her lead stating, \\"May we make our flaws famous, and thus redefine the heinous.\\" She accompanied the photos with statements that she suffered from the eating disorders bulimia and anorexia nervosa since she was 15. # In August 2012, Born This Way Foundation Co-founder Cynthia Germanotta was one of the speakers at the U.S. Department of Education's third annual Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention Summit to coordinate \\"anti-bullying efforts with the best available research.\\" She appeared with White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett with their speeches broadcast on C-SPAN. Born This Way Foundation's work was discussed among other ongoing anti-bullying efforts.  Awards and Recognitions  Cynthia Germanotta, Lady Gaga, and Born This Way Foundation have been the recipient of numerous honors, including the National Council for Behavioral Health's Change Champion Award, the Family Online Safety Institute's award for Outstanding Achievement, the National Association of School Psychologists Special Friend to Children Award, the Anti-Defamation League's \\"No Place for Hate\\" Making a Difference Award, the Children Mending Hearts Global Changemakers Award, and the President's Medal of Excellence from the Teachers College, Columbia University.

Diyar Mudar encompasses the region on both banks of the middle course of the river Euphrates, from the area of Samosata to the town of Anah, and includes the area of the Balikh River and the lower reaches of the river Khabur. Its main cities were Raqqa in the south and Edessa (al-Ruha in Arabic) in the north, and other major cities included Harran, and Saruj (now Suru√ß). Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Mudar was usually part of al-Jazira. In the mid-10th century, the region came under Hamdanid control, and under Sayf al-Dawla it was detached from the Jazira and the Hamdanids of Mosul and subordinated to the northern Syria-based Emirate of Aleppo. In the same period, the region came under attack by the resurgent Byzantine Empire. After the loss of control of the Hamdanids, the Diyar Mudar and its cities came under the sway of the Banu Numayr, with Waththab ibn Ja'bar al-Numayri becoming autonomous governor of Harran by 1002, while Edessa was conquered by the Byzantine Empire under George Maniakes in 1032. Thereafter the region became divided into a mostly Christian-ruled northern portion, subject to Armenian colonization, while the area from Harran to the Euphrates was dominated by Arab nomadic tribes. Seljuk raids began in the 1060s and 1070s, but it was not until 1086 that the Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I unified the province under his control. The advent of the Crusades re-established the division between a Christian north (the County of Edessa) and a Muslim south, which lasted until the mid-12th century. The Ayyubids gained control of the region under Saladin, and kept it until the Mongol invasion of the Levant in 1260.

Howie Dorough of the Backstreet Boys came up with the name, which is a combination of established initialisms of each groups' names, NKOTB and BSB. Together they have released one compilation album, the eponymous NKOTBSB (2011), one single, and toured in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia in 2011 and 2012. History In summer 2010, the Backstreet Boys joined New Kids on the Block on stage at the Radio City Music Hall in New York at their invitation and performed \\"I Want It That Way\\". The show was a part of NKOTB's Casi-NO Tour. Since the performance, the media began to circulate rumors of the two uniting for a tour in the summer of 2011. On October 8, 2010, Brian Littrell, a member of the Backstreet Boys, gave the tour a 78% chance of happening. He also stated that he and Donnie Wahlberg had been working on some songs together. The tour was officially announced to begin in the summer of 2011 on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on November 8, 2010. During the interview, it was mentioned that the groups were recording a single to be released later. To promote the tour further, the groups conducted a live Q&A; session on Ustream on the same day. The newly formed supergroup first performed together at the closing of 38th Annual American Music Awards on November 21, 2010, to give the public a taste of what they would see on the tour, and again on the 2011 Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest. On March 14, 2011, the group announced that they would be releasing a joint compilation album on May 24, 2011. The album featured five tracks from each group and some new recordings by the combined supergroup. The single, titled \\"Don't Turn Out The Lights\\", was premiered on April 5, 2011 on Ryan Seacrest. The NKOTBSB Tour started at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois on May 25, 2011. On June 3, 2011, while in the middle of the tour, they went to Rockefeller Center to perform together at The Today Show. The tour ended on June 3, 2012 in Pasay, Philippines, and they performed one last time on August 18, 2012 in Hershey, PA at Summer Mixtape Festival. The performance was also their only North American appearance in 2012. During a show in London on April 29, 2012, while announcing original member Kevin Richardson's return to the Backstreet Boys, Littrell hinted that they might play some shows with all ten members in the future. In August 2012, members of New Kids on the Block also stated during Mixtape Festival that while it was their last performance together for quite some time, they might get back together down the line, and they hope there will be many more shows with the Backstreet Boys in the future. They also said that NKOTBSB is like another group altogether.

Garcia, and starring Kristen Bell and David Lambert. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and was released via video on demand on July 30, 2013, and received a limited release in theaters on August 30. Plot Leigh London is a talented writer living in New York City with a job as a journalist and a relationship with her engaged boss. At the beginning of the story, Leigh must accept the end of her love affair and is tasked with reporting the story of a tiger cub who was kept tied up as a pet in someone's home until it died. To Leigh's astonishment the piece isn't run as serious news, and she breaks down, arguing with her boss and ex-lover. Now entirely disillusioned with her life in the city, she decides to leave‚Äîwithout notifying her job‚Äîand return to her hometown. When she arrives at home Leigh's mother questions her sudden return, meanwhile her father is delighted to see her, especially after Leigh announces her decision to stay indefinitely. She becomes reacquainted with two of her former friends, art appraiser, Todd, and vice principal, Mel. While having some drinks with them, she announces that she's taken up her high school job as the community pool lifeguard, where she meets the maintenance man's son, Little Jason. Over the next few weeks, she becomes friends with Jason and his best friend, Matt, and encourages wild behavior on her two high school friends, hanging out with the teens and smoking pot. Todd happily goes along with Leigh's behavior; while Mel does too, it takes its toll on her relationship with her husband as they are trying to conceive a baby. Leigh begins to spend a lot more time with Jason, and soon she realizes her attraction to him and vice versa. One night, after hanging out at the pool after hours with their friends, Leigh goes to the bathroom/changing room where Jason follows her and they kiss. The kiss quickly escalates into sex, and this starts a relationship between the two that continues over the summer, leading to frequent sexual encounters. One day while the two are having sex in bed, Leigh realizes she's falling in love with Jason and talks him into staying around longer instead of moving to Vermont with Matt as he had planned. Matt has been kicked out by his mother and has made it clear that he is desperate to leave town. After Jason postpones the Vermont plans, Matt becomes very disheartened. Meanwhile, Mel's husband becomes increasingly frustrated with her \\"carefree\\" behavior. While at the pool one morning, Todd discovers Leigh and Jason kissing but doesn't say anything. Leigh's mother asked her to move out as she isn't the only one trying to get their life in order; Leigh stays with Jason. Her cat goes missing in the process. Todd lets it slip to Mel that Leigh is staying at Jason's and Mel discovers the relationship between the two, to her horror. She approaches Leigh in anger and plans to inform Jason's father. Leigh and Jason then go searching for her cat, only to discover Matt has committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the woods. Matt repeatedly mentions throughout the film that he hates life in the town and is desperate to get to Vermont. It seems Jason's postponement was his last bit of hope broken. This takes its toll on Jason very hard and he is deeply distraught. Leigh takes the responsibility to inform Matt's mother, who is also heartbroken at the news. Leigh consoles her until her relatives arrive and then later finds her missing cat hiding near her parents' house. At the funeral, she makes her peace with Mel and goes to meet Jason one last time before they both leave. They share an emotional hug, both showing a strong affection for one another. She gives him $1,000 she won from a journalist prize, and walks away with tears in her eyes, knowing that her feelings for Jason could never truly be acted upon. The final scene ends with a postcard from Jason stating he still thinks about her a lot and Matt also.

These two Alabama running backs each finished the game with over 150 yards; they are the first duo of running backs in SEC championship history to each have even 100 yards. The Bulldogs once again went in front by three on their very next drive, when they took only two minutes to answer with a Todd Gurley touchdown run. Georgia's defense continued to allow Alabama yardage on the ground, but they forced an Alabama punt with 7:14 remaining, still up by three. Georgia could only keep the ball for four plays and two minutes, though, as they punted back to the Tide with 5:24 left in the game. Georgia's defense was \\"stacking the line,\\" using an extra defender to prevent gains on the ground. Alabama took advantage: on first down with three minutes left, quarterback AJ McCarron used play action to free up Amari Cooper for a 45-yard touchdown pass. The Alabama defense forced Georgia to punt with two minutes left. But, Georgia used all of their timeouts while their defense also held firm. A punt gave Georgia one last drive, starting from their own 15 yard line. It seemed as if the game was over when Dee Milliner appeared to have intercepted a pass on the fourth play of the drive. However, replay overturned the interception ruling, and Georgia again had an opportunity. Three more long passes brought the Bulldogs all the way to the 8 yard line with the clock winding down. With 9 seconds to play, an Aaron Murray pass toward the end zone was deflected toward Chris Conley in the field of play. Surprised to see the ball‚Äîhe was not the intended receiver on the play‚ÄîConley caught the pass as he fell down in-bounds at the 5 yard line. The clock ran out before Georgia could run another play. Scoring summary Notes This was Alabama's 8th appearance in the title game. The previous seven appearances were all against the Florida Gators. This was Georgia's 5th appearance and second consecutive SEC Championship game. This was the first meeting between the schools since 2008. From 2006 to 2012, the winner of this game played in the BCS National Championship Game seven straight times with a record of 6‚Äì1 (LSU was defeated by fellow SEC member Alabama following winning the 2011 SEC Championship Game). Their victory in this game, along with their ranking based on their season-long performance, earned Alabama a spot in the BCS National Championship Game, where they defeated Notre Dame, 42‚Äì14.

Agriculture is an important theme in Chinese mythology. There are many myths about the invention of agriculture that have been told or written about in China (Yang 2005:70). Chinese mythology refers to those myths found in the historical geographic area of China. This includes myths in Chinese and other languages, as transmitted by Han Chinese as well as other ethnic groups (of which fifty-six are officially recognized by the current administration of China). (Yang 2005:4) Many of the myths about agriculture involve its invention by such deities or cultural heroes such as Shennong, Houji, Houtu, and Shujun: of these Shennong is the most famous, according to Lihui Yang (2005:70). There are also many other myths. Myths related to agriculture include how humans learned the use of fire, cooking, animal husbandry and the use of draft animals, inventions of various agricultural tools and implements, the domestication of various species of plants such as ginger and radishes, the evaluation and uses of various types of soil, irrigation by digging wells, and the invention of farmers markets. Other myths include events which made agriculture possible by destroying an excessive number of suns in the sky or ending the Great Flood.  Myth versus history  In the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version. (Yang 2005:12-13) This is also true in many of the accounts related to the acquisition of agricultural civilization in China.  Shennong  Shennong is generally credited with having invented basic agriculture, including the plow; although he seems to have originated as a god of the burning wind, which is perhaps a reference to slash-and-burn agriculture, according to Anthony Christie. (1968:90)  Houji  Houji was also known as Ji Qi, especially in more historically-oriented contexts. Posthumously, he was better known as Houji, from hou, meaning \\"prince/deity/spirit\\", and ji, meaning \\"agriculture\\", according to K. C. Wu (1982:234).  Houtu  A deity of the Earth who figures in various myths (Yang 2005:135-138).  Shujun  Shujun is a Chinese god of farming and cultivation, also known as Yijun and Shangjun. Alternatively he is a legendary culture hero of ancient times, who was in the family tree of ancient Chinese emperors descended from the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi). Shujun is specially credited with inventing the use of a draft animal of the bovine family to pull a plow to turn the soil prior to planting.  Great Flood  Myths about a huge flood which lasted for many years before finally being controlled often include a motif of the acquisition of the agricultural civilization. Wugu Traditionally there were five granular and storable staple food crops in China. Known as the \\"Five Grains\\", specific lists vary, but generally they include various seeds from the cereal, bean, and sometimes other families. Seeds from dog According to some mythological accounts, the ancestral seed grains of modern crops were found stuck to the hair of a dog. There are many variants of this myth. Related There are various myths related to agriculture. Humans are said to have been taught the use of fire by Suiren (Yang 2005: 71). Suiren, also known as the Drill Man, used a fire-drill to start fires, and thus to allowing food to be cooked (Christie 1968: 84). Also: animal husbandry and the use of draft animals, inventions of various agricultural tools and implements, the domestication of various species of plants such as rice and ginger and radishes, the evaluation and uses of various types of soil, and irrigation by digging wells. Other myths include events which made agriculture possible by destroying an excessive number of suns in the sky or ending the Great Flood. Also there were all sorts of deities or beings in charge of bringing rain, drought, and various cyclical phenomena such as day and night or the various seasons in their proper order, which are vital aspects of successful agriculture. Other myths include the invention of farmers markets and the invention of fermentation. Religion Yandi and Shennong (May 20, 2009). Many of the myths regarding agriculture in China are related to popular religion and ritual.

It was located on the northeast side of Beaver Stadium on the campus of the Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania until it was removed in 2012 in the aftermath of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.  Background and description  The statue was commissioned by friends of Paterno and his wife Sue in recognition of his contributions to the university and was unveiled on November 2, 2001. It was sculpted by Angelo Di Maria of Reading, Pennsylvania and took 2‚Äì3 months to complete. The statue is high and weighs . It was accompanied by a stone wall in three sections. The left section of the wall read, \\"Joseph Vincent Paterno: Educator, Coach, Humanitarian\\". The center section showed a bas-relief of players running behind Paterno. On the right was a quote from Paterno, \\"They ask me what I'd like written about me when I'm gone. I hope they write I made Penn State a better place, not just that I was a good football coach.\\" The right section also featured plaques with lists of games Paterno had coached at Penn State from 1966 to 2011. By July 27, 2012, the statue's backdrop had been demolished and was being replaced by trees and landscaping.  Removal  Following the 2011 Penn State child sex abuse scandal, there were widespread calls for the statue to be removed, including by Paterno's friend and longtime Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. At one point, an anonymous individual chartered a plane to fly over State College for several hours with a banner that read Take the Statue Down or We Will. On July 22, 2012, six months after Paterno's death, the university announced it had removed the statue and \\"store[d] it in a secure location\\", citing that it had become a \\"source of division and an obstacle to healing\\". The accompanying plaques, bas-relief, and quotations were removed as well. According to Penn State President Rodney Erickson, \\"were it to remain, the statue will be a recurring wound to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have been the victims of child abuse\\". The area where the statue once stood has since been replaced by trees.

With her sister, Doris Zames Fleischer, Zames wrote The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation, a historical survey that has been used as a disability rights textbook. Life and career Zames was born on October 29, 1932 in Brooklyn and died on June 16, 2005 in Manhattan. Disabled by a childhood bout of polio, Zames was institutionalized for many years. Because of institutionalization and the school system's automatic placement of physically disabled students in non-rigorous academic tracks, Zames was mostly self-taught, according to friends. Zames earned an undergraduate degree from Brooklyn College where she was Phi Beta Kappa. Zames' mother accompanied her to college every day and carried her books. Zames, then her family's breadwinner, worked as an actuary at MetLife, then went on to earn a doctorate in mathematics from New York University. In 1966 Zames was hired by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark, where she taught classes ranging from remedial to graduate level. She retired with the title Associate Professor of Mathematics Emeritus in 2000. Zames' activism began in the 1970s, when she joined the disability rights group Disabled in Action and began to use a motorized scooter, which enabled her to travel to protests more easily. In one of her first demonstrations, she joined a group of paraplegic activists in surrounding a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus during rush hour to protest its lack of wheelchair access, part of a campaign which ultimately resulted in all MTA buses being fitted in wheelchair lifts beginning in 1981. Once the Americans with Disabilities Act took effect, Zames joined in a successful lawsuit to make the Empire State Building accessible. She also participated in campaigns to make the school at which she taught, NJIT, wheelchair accessible. Other work focused on curb cuts, restaurants, subways, ferries, public restrooms and public buildings. Zames' activism included civil disobedience, litigation and advocacy literature to obtain full participation in public life for disabled people. According to her sister, Doris Zames Fleischer, Zames' sense of social justice included the struggles for equality for women, racial minorities, gays and other disfranchised people. Zames served on the board of Disabled in Action, the New York State Independent Living Coalition, the Disabilities Network of NYC, and WBAI, a radio station.

It is a part of the Oklahoma Army National Guard. A troop command is a command and control headquarters and planning staff for smaller units of the National Guard, within a state that are not organized under a division or brigade headquarters. In the case of states like Oklahoma that once had division organizations, the intent was also to retain some of the higher planning and coordination capabilities that the division once provided. Over time, many of the elements that once fell under 90th Troop Command have been disbanded to include the second battalions of the 179th, 180th, and 279th Infantry Regiments. History Formed from elements of the disbanded 45th Infantry Division which saw action during World War II and the Korean War, along with the 45th Field Artillery Group (today's 45th Fires Brigade) and 45th Infantry Brigade, 90th Troop Command was activated in 1968. While there is no connection by lineage, 90th Troop Command's designation hearkens back to the days of the 45th Infantry Division's Square organization. 90th Infantry Brigade was an Oklahoma brigade in the, then four-state division, composed of the 180th and 179th Infantry Regiments. The Square organization was dropped in favor of the Triangular organization, just prior to World War II, which eliminated the brigade echelons and reduced a division's maneuver regiments from four to three. Organization The 90th Troop Command is a subordinate unit of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK. The brigade commands two battalions, themselves made up of, largely of independently numbered companies, plus Oklahoma's weapons of mass destruction response team, a Public Affairs Detachment, and the Oklahoma Army Guard's band. These units are: 90th Troop Command *120th Engineer Battalion **A Company 120th Engineers (Forward Support Company) **1220th Engineer Company (Horizontal Construction) **1120th Engineer Company (Asphalt) **2120th Engineer Company (Vertical Construction) **3120th Engineer Company (Engineer Support) **120th Area Support Medical Company *345th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion 345th Headquarters and Headquarters Company **1245th Transportation Company **1345th Transportation Company **A Company 777th Aviation Support Battalion *63rd Civil Support Team (WMD) *145th Army Band *145th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment *Oklahoma Medical Detachment Missions The 90th Troop Command has federal missions of pre-mobilization to command, control, and supervise Oklahoma Army National Guard units attached to the troop command so as to provide trained and equipped units capable of immediate expansion to war strength and available for service in time of war or national emergency or when appropriate to augment the active army. Its post-mobilization federal missions are to provide support to alerted units, assistance to military family members beyond the support capability of military facilities, and preparedness to remain in federal status to assist the CONUSA with military support to civil defense, land defense, and other war-related operations. The 90th Troop Command has state missions of pre-mobilization to command, control, and supervise assigned ARNG units employed in support of civil authorities in the protection of life and property and the preservation of peace, order, and public safety under competent orders of state authorities. Its post- mobilization state mission include assisting in the organization and training of a militia if required, performing command and control functions in support of civil authorities as directed, and preparing to reconstitute the ARANG/ANG when units are released from federal service.

It was discovered in 1993 during work to remove a road near the pyramid G1 (the Great Pyramid of Giza). It is located about 25m southeast of the southeast corner of the Great Pyramid of Giza and about 7 m west of the subsidiary pyramids G1‚Äìb and G1‚Äìc. Pyramid G1-d pyramidion All the stonework of the pyramid core had been removed in ancient times. What remains of the superstructure core is two courses of stone. There was also a substructure which was U-shaped but this was destroyed in antiquity. During the excavation the actual apex stone of the pyramid, a single piece of fine Tura-quality limestone, was found. It is the second oldest pyramidion ever found, the earliest belonging to the North Pyramid of Sneferu discovered by Rainer Stadelmann at Dahshur. This rare find has been left in place. One inscription was found written in red paint on the inside surface of one block set in the south wall. The notation says, \\"imy rsy S3.\\" This graffiti, meaning \\"on the south (back) side,\\" probably instructed the stone movers where to place the block. The purpose of the pyramid is under debate by scholars. Some possible explanations are that it is for the king's Ka, or it represents the king as the ruler of Upper Egypt, or it is for the viscera of the King, or it is a dummy room for the Sed festival, or it has a solar function. Zahi Hawass, who led the uncovering of the pyramid, believed that the satellite pyramid was used symbolically as a changing room for the Sed festival.http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf_library/hawass_va_10_1995.pdf See also *Pyramid G1-a *Pyramid G1-b *Pyramid G1-c * List of Egyptian pyramids References  External links * The discovery of the satellite Pyramid of Khufu * The discovery of the satellite Pyramid of Khufu * The revised and complete article on the pyramidion of the satellite pyramid of Khufu, g1d * Origins of Pyramid GI-d, Southeast of the Great Pyramid Giza Plateau Pyramids of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt ","title":"Pyramid G1-d"},{"id":"36474029","text":"Titanic II is a planned ocean liner intended to be a functional modern- day replica of the Olympic-class . The new ship is planned to have a gross tonnage (GT) of 56,000 while the original ship measured about 46,000 gross register tons (GRT). The project was announced by Australian billionaire Clive Palmer in April 2012 as the flagship of the proposed cruise company Blue Star Line Pty. Ltd. of Brisbane, Australia. The intended launch date was originally set in 2016, delayed to 2018, then 2022. The development of the project was resumed in November 2018 after a hiatus which began in 2015, caused by a financial dispute that affected the $500 million project. Previous projects The original in 1912. The proposed ship The concept of a functioning replica of the Titanic has been explored several times, especially following the resurgence of interest following the release of James Cameron's film in 1997. The most widely publicized project was that of South African businessman Sarel Gous in 1998. The South African project began in 1998, and was one of the subjects of an article in Popular Mechanics magazine in September of that year. The article discussed the changes to the original design required to produce a safe and economically viable ship, including a welded rather than riveted hull, diesel-electric propulsion in place of steam engines, and a bulbous bow. The article concluded that although the various Titanic revival projects would cost $400‚Äì$600 million, they could be economically viable. Although he originally intended to construct the ship in Durban, Gous presented his ¬£500 million proposal to Belfast City Council in June 2000. He commissioned Olsen Designs to design the ship, advised by Harland and Wolff Technical Services who produced a feasibility study, and Callcott Anderson to design the interior. In November 2000, he began his attempts to raise capital, including through government grants and a stock market flotation. After signing an agreement with a Monaco-based investment banking company, Gous claimed that construction would begin at Harland and Wolff within nine months. The design changed repeatedly, with claims emerging of 'the world's largest liner' with capacity for 2,600 passengers, and increasingly divergent plans for a heliport, swimming pools and discos eventually being released. In 2006, after repeatedly failing to secure investment, the project was abandoned. Design stage Clive Palmer, chairman of the Blue Star Line Clive Palmer first announced the project in a press conference on 30 April 2012, following the signature of a memorandum of understanding with state-owned Chinese shipyard CSC Jinling ten days before. On 19 June, it was announced that Finnish naval architecture firm Deltamarin Ltd. had been commissioned to undertake the design of the ship, and on 17 July a preliminary general arrangement was published. In October 2012, Blue Star Line announced that Titanic expert Steve Hall had been appointed as Design Consultant and Historian for the project, and that Titanic interiors expert Daniel Klistorner had been appointed as Interior Design Consultant and Historian. Hall and Klistorner had previously co-authored books such as Titanic: The Ship Magnificent and Titanic in Photographs, and gave a technical presentation at the unveiling of the designs in New York, as well as at the dinner in London. Later that month, it was announced that an advisory board would be formed to provide \\"suggestions and recommendations to Blue Star Line to ensure the Titanic II appropriately and respectfully pays homage to Titanic, her crew and passengers.\\" Terry Ismay, the great-great nephew of White Star Line chairman and Titanic survivor J. Bruce Ismay, will be a member of the board, as well as Helen Benziger, great-granddaughter of Titanic survivor Margaret \\"Molly\\" Brown. The design for the Titanic II was unveiled at worldwide launch events in Macau (China), New York (United States), Halifax (Canada), London & Southampton (United Kingdom). The gala event in New York was the official Global Launch and was held aboard the USS Intrepid in New York City on 26 February 2013. The gala dinner in London (UK) was held at the Natural History Museum on 2 March, and was accompanied by a display of items salvaged from the Titanic. There was also a breakfast held in Southampton on 13 March. On 16 April 2013 it was announced that Deltamarin had been contracted for the project development phase, and would be responsible for coordinating the various parties involved in the project, including the shipyard, architects, interior designers and operations managers. The feasibility study was complete, and the project development phase was ongoing. The signature of a contract and keel laying was expected in March 2014. Further contracts and agreements relating to the design and construction were announced later in 2013; the appointment of V.Ships Leisure as ship management services partner, and of Tillberg Design as provider of architectural and interior design services. On 17 July 2013, Blue Star Line announced that the classification society Lloyd's Register has joined the Titanic II project. The work carried by Lloyd's would ensure that the ship's design complied with the current SOLAS regulations. Model testing using a wooden model was undertaken in September 2013 at the Hamburgische Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt (HSVA). Resistance and powering tests were carried out in a towing tank. In an interview in February 2014, Palmer claimed that keel laying would take place in September 2014. He cautioned that the project was \\"a big job\\", that the original Titanic took seven years to build while they have been working for only two and a half, and said that he would have liked to start sooner but \\"wanted to make sure we don't make any mistakes\\". He claimed that a selection of cabins were being constructed on land for approval, and that this would be completed by July 2014. In April 2016, the administrators for Palmer's closed nickel refining company, Queensland Nickel alleged that almost $6 million had been taken from that company to pay for the development and marketing of the Titanic II. At that time the administrators indicated that they would seek to recover this money. Design and construction The gross tonnage of the replica will be 56,000 GT, considerably more than that of the original.The original Titanic had a gross register tonnage of 46,328 GRT, which is not directly comparable with modern gross tonnage. However, as one register ton is equal to , an approximate value of 39,640 GT can be calculated by using the formulae given in The International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 . =Comparison with the original RMS Titanic= The ship is designed to be as similar in internal and external appearance to the Titanic as possible. However, today's safety regulations and economic considerations dictated several major changes to the design, including: * Greater beam for enhanced stability * Welded, not riveted, hull * Reduced draught (draft) * Bulbous bow for higher fuel efficiency, although moderately sized compared to ships of newer designs A preliminary comparison of the profiles of the Titanic (blue) and the Titanic II (red) * Stabilizers to reduce roll * Diesel-electric propulsion system with four diesel generating sets providing power for three azimuth thrusters to replace the original coal-fired boilers, steam engines and steam turbine, as well as the rudder. Also, the ship would have had 2 bow thrusters. * An additional \\"safety deck\\" between C and D decks for lifeboats and marine evacuation systems, with the boat deck housing replicas of the original lifeboats. Space for the deck was made by lowering decks D and below by 2.8 metres, and for the taller centre section of the safety deck, which would have housed the lifeboats, by raising the superstructure by 1.3 metres. In spite of the reduced draft, space was made for the lowered decks by removing the orlop deck, which mainly housed the boilers. * New 'escape staircases' in addition to the original staircases, housed in the redundant boiler exhaust uptakes. * Observation decks in the redundant first two funnels, which would have had, according to Deltamarin, tinted window coverings to blend in with the funnels' color, intended to be as close as possible to the original \\"White Star buff.\\" * No sheer or camber, unlike the original. Pronounced sheer was a cosmetic feature of ocean liners, intended to add a graceful appearance to the ship, but made construction more difficult and therefore costly. Renderings released in February 2013 showed an upwards rake added to C Deck at the bow and stern to give a superficial appearance of sheer, although an inauthentic wedge-shaped gap has had to be added between C and D decks in these areas to produce this effect. * A higher bridge relative to the bow, as the superstructure has been raised by 1.3 metres by the centre section of the safety deck, and also by the removal of the sheer. This negates the requirement on the original Titanic for lookouts. * An overall increase in the height of the ship above the waterline (due to the insertion of the safety deck). However, the total height of the ship from the keel to funnels would be the same as the original, at . =Power plant and propulsion= For economic reasons, the steam engines and coal-fired boilers of the original Titanic would be replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system. The space which housed the boilers would be used for crew quarters and ships systems. Power was to be produced by four W√§rtsil√§ 46F medium-speed four-stroke diesel generating sets; two twelve-cylinder 12V46F engines producing each, and two eight-cylinder 8L46F engines producing each, running on heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil. Propulsion would have been by three azimuth thrusters which would also be used for manoeuvring, while the replica of the rudder of the Titanic II is purely cosmetic, and would not have extended substantially below the waterline. The positioning of the azimuth thrusters necessitated the stern being made substantially more blunt than the original. View of a corridor on the showing the sheer. This feature was to be lost on the Titanic II. =Interior= The interior of the ship was intended to be as similar as possible to the original. Tillberg Design of Sweden was contracted to produce drawings replicating Titanic original interiors. However, the original wooden panelling does not conform to modern fire regulations, so as in Queen Mary 2, veneers would have had to be used. Plans showed a layout broadly similar to the original, but with the third-class cabins modernised, and consideration being given to en-suite bathrooms throughout the ship. The room freed up by eliminating the steam boilers of the original ship would have been used for crew quarters and various services. Criticism The Titanic II would represent the first major passenger vessel constructed in China, a country with much more experience of building cargo ships than cruise ships, and a significant investment would be required to ensure it met the much more stringent safety requirements for passenger vessels. The Chinese state-owned CSC Jinling shipyard has never built a large passenger vessel. In addition, it has no drydock, instead using side launching from a 200 m slipway. The 269 m Titanic II would have been the largest side-launched vessel in history by a huge margin, and would have required a significant extension to the shipyard's facilities. Representatives from the shipyard had questioned whether the ship could have been completed by 2016, and emphasized that no contract had been signed. Clive Palmer has been described as an \\"eccentric billionaire\\" with a reputation for bizarre publicity stunts, such as the attempt to create a massive Jurassic Park style dinosaur theme park at his golf resort. It has also been noted that the publicity surrounding the Titanic II coincided with Palmer's announcement of his entry into Australian federal politics, which was made immediately following the Titanic II conference. Palmer had previously claimed that he was the target of a conspiracy involving Barack Obama, the CIA, the Rockefeller Foundation and Greenpeace, who he believed were attempting to close down his mining operation. In 2010, Palmer started a company called Zeppelin International, with the intention of making a commercially viable Zeppelin. After the plan came to nothing, it was ridiculed as the 'bizarre move of the year' by Australian business website Smartcompany. He has gained a reputation in Australia for floating ambitious and unusual business ideas which he fails to see through, and the Titanic II has been described as \\"a classic Clive Palmer announcement.\\" The idea of a commercialised replica of the Titanic has itself been criticised, being described as \\"insensitive\\" and \\"a mockery of the memory of those who died\\". Charles Haas, president of the U.S.-based Titanic International Society, questioned both its appropriateness and commercial viability, telling Scientific American, \\"It‚Äôs a matter of sensitivity, respect and thoughtfulness ... we commemorate tragedies and those lost in them, not duplicate them\\". The New York Times quoted Haas as saying, \\"As good as the Titanic was in her day, it would be a practical and financial disaster\\", due to the relative lack of onboard activities and modern amenities such as theaters, casinos, and waterslides, compared to today's cruise ships. Cunard Line, which acquired the White Star Line legacy when the companies merged in 1934, stated that they \\"have always been very mindful and very respectful of such a tragic event [and] don't think that building a replica or a 'II' is appropriate.\\" Palmer's alleged use of funds drawn from Queensland Nickel for the Titanic II project was criticised by the administrators appointed for that company after it closed. In their April 2016 report, the administrators stated that payments from Queensland Nickel to Blue Star Line had been \\"uncommercial and director- related transactions\\". Palmer has rejected the claims made against him in the report, including those related to the Titanic II. Project status When the project was first announced in 2012, Palmer claimed that construction would begin before the end of the year, with a 2016 launch. The following year reports emerged that Clive Palmer was experiencing financial difficulties. The start of construction was postponed to March 2014, then to late 2014. When construction had still not begun in 2015 a spokesman for Palmer said the project had merely been delayed, and that the new ship would be launched in 2018 - two years later than initially planned. However Deltamarin had told an Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist that work on the Titanic II project had been halted while workers at the Chinese shipyard identified as the likely site of construction were highly skeptical that the project would ever move beyond the proposal stage and the Blue Star Line trademark was \\"abandoned.\\" Queensland Nickel went bankrupt and Palmer faced freezing of personal assets to recoup money owed the company's employees and creditors. On September 27, 2018 the Blue Star Line, in a press release on their official web site, announced that work on the project would recommence. In May 2019 a European maritime equipment consortium published a list of all cruise ships on order through 2027 but none of the listed vessels fit Deltamarin's specifications for Titanic II. In a reply to a reader query on their website in May 2020, Deltamarin responded that the conceptual design had been sent to several shipyards for pricing. Romandisea Titanic Palmer's project should not be confused with a Chinese Romandisea Titanic replica ship which had its keel laying on November 29, 2016. Commissioned by Seven Star Energy Investment, it is to function as a part of Romandisea resort on the River Qi in Sichuan province. Unlike Palmer's Titanic II, the all-Chinese replica is not intended to sail on any ocean but will be permanently docked within a reservoir. In June 2020 the project's official media site posted an image of the forecastle section nearly completed.

It enabled the rafting of timber for the mining and smelting industries in the Ore Mountains of eastern Germany. It ran from the River Fl√∂ha near Fleyh (Fl√°je) to the Freiberger Mulde near Clausnitz in the Ore Mountains.  Course  Starting at Fleyh this artificial water channel ran for about 3.5 km in a northwesterly direction to the eastern end of Bohemian Georgenthal (today ƒåesk√Ω Ji≈ôet√≠n). Here it changed direction by almost 180¬∞ and ran for about 3 km eastwards into the Rauschenbach valley. After crossing the Rauschenbach stream and the Bohemian-German border it continued towards the west. North of C√§mmerswalde it crossed the watershed between Fl√∂ha and the Freiberger Mulde rivers. From there on the ditch ran in a northerly direction through Clausnitz and discharged finally after about 18 km at the southeastern end of Clausnitz into the River Rachel. Shortly behind Fl√°je the ditch crosses a steep hillside and the channel is hewn out of the rock. The channel also crosses several streams en route to Clausnitz, for example, it crosses the Rauschenbach after about 6.5 km and the Czech-German border that runs along it here.  History  The Neugrabenfl√∂√üe between Deutschgeorgenthal and C√§mmerswalde The channel was dug in the years 1624‚Äì1629 at the instigation of the lords of Lobkowicz in Bohemia and Sch√∂nberg in Saxony. It was commissioned by the Saxon prince-elector, John George I. By 1569 the Saxon chief mining engineer (Oberbergmeister), Martin Planer, had produced the first plans for a rafting channel from the source region of the River Fl√∂ha to the Freiberger Mulde, which had to cross the watershed of both river catchment areas. But the Neugrabenfl√∂√üe was not built until the 17th century to new plans by chief smelting officer (Oberh√ºttenverwalter), Friedrich Lingke. The rafting channel was used for almost 250 years to transport logs from Fleyh in the Freiberg mining region. With the construction of the railway link from Freiberg to Rechenberg-Bienenm√ºhle, timber rafting on the channel ceased.  Closure of the mines and present state  Following the closure of the mines the channel continued to be used until the 1940s to supply water for the Georgendorf Paper Factory. After the factory shut the Neugrabenfl√∂√üe was forgotten. Today many parts of the channel are filled or levelled.

Many initiatives exist today on various indicators (quality, performance and life) and on normalization of trade. The City Protocol addresses the city under a systemic approach. Cities can usefully be described as complex systems since their components interact and co-determine their future. Thus, urban planning is limited by the very nature of their complexity. The city has a metabolism and a rich ecosystem, it‚Äôs very heterogeneous. Like any complex system, it changes over time, it evolves, it is fragile and must adapt to changes. Resilience is the key to also ensure continuity of services in the city at any time of crisis. Two major vectors through the development of the city, the need, its uses and functions, and chance, hazard and risk. The city should be adaptive, learning, evolving, robust, autonomous, self-repairing, and self-reproducing.Transformando una ciudad en marcha Goals The City Protocol has five fundamental goals: # To facilitate and foster a new science of cities. # To establish a cooperation framework among the city council, academia, companies, organizations and people/society. # To lead and pave cities‚Äô futures. # To understand the common driving forces of urban evolution and find common game-changing solutions. # To find innovative economical opportunities and synergies: and deliver valueadding products and services. The City Protocol will move worldwide city thinking forward effectively and remain appealing and available to a wide range of cities and smart city communities. City Protocol will create a reflection community, a sharing space and opportunities to build complete or partly solutions to allow the emergent new generation solutions for a sustainable city.City Protocol Goals Development Process of the City Protocol The City Protocol will be created through a number of stages that will span some 18 months: * Stage 1, to July 2012: will enroll a discrete group of core Cities, Institutions, Industry, and Academia to agree the need for, and shape the City protocol Society. Kick start of Working Groups (CPWG) and areas of work.Cities, companies and universities are preparing the first City Protocol document in Barcelona. Barcelona City Hall news. * Stage 2, to November 2012: will build agreements (CPA) on the principles, focus, commitment and manner by which the society will operate and the goals and outline content that it will address. The CPS will start operating under this stage. * Stage 3, to November 2013: will establish from the core committed participants, visible initial products that the society can evidence as true and meaningful value. Once the CPS has been established, working groups (WG) will be set up. Said WG will work remotely under a periodical basis. Face to face meetings will take place to discuss and work around the CP.City Protocol Methodology References External links *City Protocol Society site *City Protocol Launch in Barcelona, CISCO 11-14-2012 * City Protocol Society in Barcelona City Hall * Primera not√≠cia de l'estrat√®gia de l'Ajuntament de Barcelona.

In addition, this election was accompanied by six referendums, each dealing with a major issue in the city at the time.\\"Council Approves Issues On Which City Will Vote\\", Hamilton Spectator, Wednesday, November 1, 1950, pg. 19. Referendums Mayoral Election In the months before the vote, rumours circulated the city that the city's popular mayor, Lloyd Jackson, would face a serious contest from a number of prominent Controllers, namely William K.

Despite their amicable relationship with the mayor, their terms on council were widely viewed as spent establishing themselves for a mayoral run.Tom Mills. \\"Hint At Two Candidates In '51 Test\\", Hamilton Spectator, Monday, November 13, 1950, pg. 8. On November 17, Labor-Progressive Party executive member and former city Controller Helen Anderson Coulson announced her intention to stand against the mayor. Discussions concerning possible opponents for the mayor waned after Warrender and Hicks announced their intentions to stand for re-election to the Board of Control, and the possibility of an acclamation for the mayoralty seemed certain. Coulson made the announcement, stating, \\"In view of the urgent need for the labour movement to oppose a second term for the sitting incumbent mayor, I have decided...to contest the mayoralty.\\"Helen Anderson Coulson To Oppose Mayor Jackson\\", Hamilton Spectator, Friday, November 17, 1950, pg. 7. Coulson's announcement brought both indignation and dismissal from prominent officials in the city, with Mayor Jackson simply quipping, \\"Let her come\\", while Controller Warrender pressed the fact that an avowed Communist was seeking the highest office in the city and the voters should rebuke her for her views. Hicks made a statement to the Spectator the following day, saying that the voters of Hamilton should be, \\"stirred out of their lethargy to realize that there are Communists in our midst making a bold bid for support.\\"Mayoral Race Likely To Boost Vote December 6\\", Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, November 18, 1950, pg. 7. The city's organized labour movement convened shortly after the close of nominations to study the issue of mayoral endorsement. Rather than take the side of Mayor Jackson, a conservative-minded politician or that of Coulson, an avowed Communist, the city's unions pushed for a stronger get-out-the-vote campaign and made individual endorsements for aldermanic and controller seats.\\"Labour Council Studies Mayoralty Race Problem\\", Hamilton Spectator, Saturday, November 25, 1950, pg. 20.

Many believe it to be the greatest wave of social unrest the United States had experienced since the Civil War. Some of the biggest riots took place in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Kansas City. Overview =Causes= The immediate cause of the rioting was the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. King was not only a leader in the civil rights movement, but also an advocate for nonviolence. He pursued direct engagement with the political system (as opposed to the separatist ideas of black nationalism). His death led to anger and disillusionment, and feelings that now only violent resistance to white supremacy could be effective. =Riots= The rioters were mostly Black; not all were poor. Middle-class Black people also demonstrated against systemic inequality. Although the media called these events \\"race riots\\", there were few confirmed acts of violence between blacks and whites. White businesses tended to be targeted; however, white public and community buildings such as schools and churches were largely spared. Compared to the previous summer of rioting, the number of fatalities was lower, largely attributed to new procedures instituted by the federal government, and orders not to fire on looters. Events by city In New York City, mayor John Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited for averting major riots in New York with this direct response although minor disturbances still erupted in the city. In Indianapolis, Indiana, Senator Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. is credited with preventing a riot there. In Boston, rioting may have been averted by a James Brown concert taking place on the night of April 5, with Brown, Mayor Kevin White, and City Councilor Tom Atkins speaking to the Garden crowd about peace and unity before the show. In Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department and community activists averted a repeat of the 1965 riots that devastated portions of the city. Several memorials were held in tribute to King throughout the Los Angeles area on the days leading into his funeral service. =Washington, D.C.= Damage to a Washington store following the riots The Washington, D.C., riots of April 4‚Äì8, 1968, resulted in Washington, along with Chicago and Baltimore, receiving the heaviest impact of the 110 cities to see unrest following the King assassination. The ready availability of jobs in the growing federal government attracted many to Washington since the early 20th century, and middle class African-American neighborhoods prospered. Despite the end of legally mandated racial segregation, the historic neighborhoods of Shaw, the H Street Northeast corridor, and Columbia Heights, centered at the intersection of 14th and U Streets Northwest, remained the centers of African-American commercial life in the city. As word of King's murder by James Earl Ray in Memphis spread on the evening of Thursday, April 4, crowds began to gather at 14th and U. Stokely Carmichael led members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to stores in the neighborhood demanding that they close out of respect. Although polite at first, the crowd fell out of control and began breaking windows. By 11pm, widespread looting had begun. Mayor-Commissioner Walter Washington ordered the damage cleaned up immediately the next morning. However, anger was still evident on Friday morning when Carmichael addressed a rally at Howard, warning of violence. After the close of the rally, crowds walking down 7th Street NW and in the H Street NE corridor came into violent confrontations with police. By midday, numerous buildings were on fire, and firefighters were prevented from responding by crowds attacking with bottles and rocks. Crowds of as many as 20,000 overwhelmed the District's 3,100-member police force, and 11,850 federal troops and 1,750 D.C. National Guardsmen under orders of President Lyndon B. Johnson arrived on the streets of D.C. to assist them. Marines mounted machine guns on the steps of the Capitol and Army soldiers from the 3rd Infantry guarded the White House. At one point, on April 5, rioting reached within two blocks of the White House before rioters retreated. The occupation of Washington was the largest of any American city since the Civil War. Mayor Washington imposed a curfew and banned the sale of alcohol and guns in the city. By the time the city was considered pacified on Sunday, April 8, some 1,200 buildings had been burned, including over 900 stores. Damages reached $27 million. The riots utterly devastated Washington's inner city economy. With the destruction or closing of businesses, thousands of jobs were lost, and insurance rates soared. Made uneasy by the violence, city residents of all races accelerated their departure for suburban areas, depressing property values. Crime in the burned out neighborhoods rose sharply, further discouraging investment. On some blocks, only rubble remained for decades. Columbia Heights and the U Street corridor did not begin to recover economically until the opening of the U Street and Columbia Heights Metro stations in 1991 and 1999, respectively, while the H Street NE corridor remained depressed for several years longer. Mayor-Commissioner Washington, who was the last presidentially appointed mayor of Washington, went on to become the city's first elected mayor. =Chicago= DASPO CONUS on April 9, 1968, of Chicago after the riots On April 5, one day after King was assassinated, violence sparked on the West side of Chicago. It eventually expanded to consume a 28-block stretch of West Madison Street, with additional damage occurring on Roosevelt Road. The North Lawndale and East Garfield Park neighborhoods on the West Side and the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side experienced the majority of the destruction and chaos. The rioters broke windows, looted stores, and set buildings (both abandoned and occupied) on fire. Firefighters quickly flooded the neighborhood, and Chicago's off-duty firefighters were told to report for duty. There were 36 major fires reported between 4:00 pm and 10:00 pm alone. The next day, Mayor Richard J. Daley imposed a curfew on anyone under the age of 21, closed the streets to automobile traffic, and halted the sale of guns or ammunition. Approximately 10,500 police were sent in, and by April 6, more than 6,700 Illinois National Guard troops had arrived in Chicago with 5,000 regular Army soldiers from the 1st Armored and 5th Infantry Divisions being ordered into the city by President Johnson. The General in charge declared that no one was allowed to have gatherings in the riot areas, and he authorized the use of tear gas. Mayor Richard J. Daley gave police the authority \\"to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail in his hand ... and ... to shoot to maim or cripple anyone looting any stores in our city.\\" By the time order was restored on April 7, 11 people had died, 500 had been injured, and 2,150 had been arrested. Over 200 buildings were damaged in the disturbance with damage costs running up to $10 million. The south side ghetto had escaped the major chaos mainly because the two large street gangs, the Blackstone Rangers and the East Side Disciples, cooperated to control their neighborhoods. Many gang members did not participate in the rioting, due in part to King's direct involvement with these groups in 1966. =Baltimore= The Baltimore riot of 1968 began two days after the murder. On Saturday, April 6, the Governor of Maryland, Spiro T. Agnew, called out thousands of National Guard troops and 500 Maryland State Police to quell the disturbance. When it was determined that the state forces could not control the riot, Agnew requested Federal troops from President Lyndon B. Johnson. The riot was precipitated by King's assassination, but was also evidence of larger frustrations among the city's African-American population. By Sunday evening, 5,000 paratroopers, combat engineers, and artillerymen from the XVIII Airborne Corps in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, specially trained in tactics, including sniper school, were on the streets of Baltimore with fixed bayonets, and equipped with chemical (CS) disperser backpacks. Two days later, they were joined by a Light Infantry Brigade from Fort Benning, Georgia. With all the police and troops on the streets, the situation began to calm down. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that H. Rap Brown was in Baltimore driving a Ford Mustang with Broward County, Florida tags, and was assembling large groups of angry protesters and agitating them to escalate the rioting. In several instances, these disturbances were rapidly quelled through the use of bayonets and chemical dispersers by the XVIII Airborne units. That unit arrested more than 3,000 detainees, who were turned over to the Baltimore Police. A general curfew was set at 6 p.m. in the city limits and martial law was enforced. As rioting continued, African American plainclothes police officers and community leaders were sent to the worst areas to prevent further violence. By the end of the unrest, 6 people had died, 700 were injured, and 5,800 had been arrested; property damage was estimated at over $12 million. One of the major outcomes of the riot was the attention Governor Agnew received when he criticized local black leaders for not doing enough to help stop the disturbance. While this angered blacks and white liberals, it caught the attention of Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, who was looking for someone on his ticket who could counter George Wallace's American Independent Party campaign. Agnew became Nixon's vice presidential running mate in 1968. =Kansas City= The rioting in Kansas City did not erupt on April 4, like other cities of the United States affected directly by the assassination of King, but rather on April 9 after local events within the city. The riot was sparked when Kansas City Police Department deployed tear gas against student protesters when they staged their performances outside City Hall. The deployment of tear gas dispersed the protesters from the area, but other citizens of the city began to riot as a result of the police action on the student protesters. The resulting effects of the riot resulted in the arrest of over 100 adults, and left five dead and at least 20 admitted to hospitals. =Detroit= Although not as large as other cities, violent disturbances did erupt in Detroit. Michigan Governor George W. Romney ordered the National Guard into Detroit. One person was killed,https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&dat;=19680406&printsec;=frontpage&hl;=en \\"10 Dead As Violence Continues In Major U.S. Cities; Troops Sent To Washington, Chicago, Detroit\\" Toledo Blade, April 5, 1968. and gangs tossed objects at cars and smashed storefront windows along 12th Street on the west side.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SAguW2jnL4UC&dat;=19680405&printsec;=frontpage&hl;=en \\"Ghettoes react to King's death\\" The Windsor Star, April 5, 1968. =New York City= Riots erupted in New York City the night King was murdered. Sporadic violence and looting occurred in Harlem, the largest African-American neighborhood in Manhattan. Tensions simmered down after Mayor John Lindsay traveled into the heart of the area and stated that he regretted King's wrongful death. However, numerous businesses were still looted and set afire in Harlem and Brooklyn following the statement. =Pittsburgh= Disturbances erupted in Pittsburgh on April 5 and continued through April 11. The riot peaked on April 7 in which one person was killed and 3,600 National Guardsmen were deployed into the city. Over 100 businesses were either looted or burned in the Hill District, Homewood, and North Side neighborhoods with various structures being set afire by arsonists. The riot left many of the city's black commercial districts in shambles and the areas most impacted by the unrest were slow to recover in the following decades. =Cincinnati= The Cincinnati riots were in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. Tension in the Avondale neighborhood had already been high due to a lack of job opportunities for African-American men, and the assassination escalated that tension. On April 8, around 1,500 blacks attended a memorial held at a local recreation center. An officer of the Congress of Racial Equality blamed white Americans for King's death and urged the crowd to retaliate. The crowd was orderly when it left the memorial and spilled out into the street. Nearby James Smith, a black man, attempted to protect a jewelry store from a robbery with his own shotgun. During the struggle with the robbers, also black, Smith accidentally shot and killed his wife. Rioting started after a false rumor was spread in the crowd that Smith's wife was actually killed by a white police officer. Rioters smashed store windows and looted merchandise. More than 70 fires had been set, several of them major. During the rioting eight young African Americans dragged a white student, Noel Wright, and his wife from their car in Mount Auburn. Wright was stabbed to death and his wife was beaten. The next night, the city was put under curfew, and nearly 1,500 National Guardsmen were brought in to subdue the violence. Several days after the riot started, two people were dead, hundreds were arrested, and the city had suffered $3 million in property damage. =Trenton, New Jersey= The Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4. More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters were treated at city hospitals for smoke inhalation, burns, sprains and cuts suffered while fighting raging blazes or for injuries inflicted by rioters. Denizens of Trenton's urban core often pulled false alarms and would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes. This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines. As an interim measure, the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7 million, but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5 million.Cumbler, John T. A Social History of Economic Decline: Business, Politics and Work in Trenton, p. 283. Rutgers University Press, 1989. . Accessed February 12, 2014. Trenton's Battle Monument neighborhood was hardest hit. Since the 1950s, North Trenton had witnessed a steady exodus of middle- class residents, and the riots spelled the end for North Trenton. By the 1970s, the region had become one of the most blighted and crime-ridden in the city, although gentrification in the area eventually followed. =Wilmington, Delaware= The two-day riot that occurred after King's assassination was small compared with riots in other cities, but its aftermath ‚Äì a -month occupation by the National Guard - highlighted the depth of Wilmington's racial problem. During the riot, which occurred on April 9‚Äì10, 1968, the mayor asked for a small number of National Guardsmen to help restore order. Democratic Governor Charles L. Terry (a southern-style Democrat) sent in the entire state National Guard and refused to remove them after the rioting was brought under control. Republican Russell W. Peterson defeated Governor Terry, and upon his inauguration in January 1969, Governor Peterson ended the National Guard's occupation in Wilmington.Jennifer Alice Delton, Racial Integration in Corporate America, 1940‚Äì1990 p. 262. The Occupation of Wilmington caused scars on the city and its people that have lasted to this day. Some suburbanites grew fearful of traveling into Wilmington in broad daylight, even to attend church on Sunday morning. Over the next few years businesses relocated, taking their employees, customers and tax payments with them.http://www.hanoverchurch.org/HanoversHistory/TheOccupationofWilmington/tabid/47145/Default.aspx =Louisville= Riots occurred in Louisville, Kentucky, in May 1968. As in many other cities around the country, there were unrest and riots partially in response to the assassination. On May 27, 1968, a group of 400 people, mostly blacks, gathered at Twenty-Eight and Greenwood Streets, in the Parkland neighborhood. The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there. The crowd was protesting the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating an African-American man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse. However, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow. The police, including a captain who was hit in the face by a bottle, retreated, leaving behind a patrol car, which was turned over and burned. By midnight, rioters had looted stores as far east as Fourth Street, overturned cars and started fires. Within an hour, Mayor Kenneth A. Schmied requested 700 Kentucky National Guard troops and established a citywide curfew. Violence and vandalism continued to rage the next day, but had subdued somewhat by May 29. Business owners began to return, although troops remained until June 4. Police made 472 arrests related to the riots. Two African- American teenagers had died, and $200,000 in damage had been done. The disturbances had a longer-lasting effect. Most white business owners quickly pulled out or were forced out of Parkland and surrounding areas. Most white residents also left the West End, which had been almost entirely white north of Broadway, from subdivision until the 1960s. The riot would have effects that shaped the image which whites would hold of Louisville's West End, that it was predominantly black and crime-ridden. Local issues The assassinations triggered active unrest in communities that were already discontented. For example, the Memphis Sanitation Strike, which was already underway, took on a new level of urgency. It was to these striking workers that King delivered his final speech, and in Memphis that he was killed. Negotiations on April 16 brought an end to the strike and a promise of better wages. In Oakland, increasing friction between Black Panthers and the police led to the death of Bobby Hutton. Official responses =President Johnson= President Lyndon B. Johnson and Joe Califano chart riot outbreaks in Washington, DC. On April 4, President Lyndon B. Johnson denounced King's murder. He also began to communicate with a host of mayors and governors preparing for a reaction from black America. He cautioned against unnecessary force, but felt like local governments would ignore his advice, saying to aides, \\"I'm not getting through. They're all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\\" On April 5, at 11:00 AM, Johnson met with an array of leaders in the Cabinet Room. These included Vice President Hubert Humphrey, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and federal judge Leon Higginbotham; government officials such as secretary Robert Weaver and D.C. Mayor Walter Washington; legislators Mike Mansfield, Everett Dirksen, William McCulloch; and civil rights leaders Whitney Young, Roy Wilkins, Clarence Mitchell, Dorothy Height, and Walter Fauntroy. Notably absent were representatives of more radical groups such as SNCC and CORE. At the meeting, Mayor Washington asked President Johnson to deploy troops to the District of Columbia. Richard Hatcher, the newly elected black mayor of Gary, Indiana, spoke to the group about white racism and his fears of racially motivated violence in the future. Many of these leaders told Johnson that socially progressive legislation would be the best response to the crisis. The meeting concluded with prayers at the Washington National Cathedral. According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was not surprised by the riots that followed: \\"What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off.\\" =Military deployment= After the Watts riots in 1965 and the Detroit riot of 1967, the military began preparing heavily for black insurrection. The Pentagon's Army Operations Center thus quickly began its response to the assassination on the night of April 4, directing air force transport planes to prepare for an occupation of Washington, D.C. The Army also dispatched undercover agents to gather information. On April 5, Johnson ordered mobilization of the Army and National Guard, particularly for D.C. =Legislative response= Some responded to the riots with suggestions for improving the conditions that engendered them. Many White House aides took the opportunity to push their preferred programs for urban improvement. At the same time, some members of Congress criticized Johnson. Senator Richard Russell felt Johnson was not going far enough to suppress the violence. Senator Robert Byrd suggested that Washington, D.C. ought to be occupied indefinitely by the army. Johnson chose to focus his political capital on a fair housing bill proposed by Senator Sam Ervin. He urged Congress to pass the bill, starting with an April 5 letter addressed to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, John William McCormack. These events led to the rapid passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Title VIII of which is known as the \\"Fair Housing Act\\". =President's communication with local governments= Audio records reveal a tense and variable relationship between Johnson and local officials. In conversations with Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, Johnson describes the complications with ordering federal troops before local governments have exhausted all options. Later, Johnson would describe the domestic unrest as another front in the global war, criticizing Daley for not requesting troops sooner. From the transcript: In the same call, Johnson told Daley he wanted to use a strategy of pre-emption: \\"I'd rather move them and not need them than need them and not have them.\\" Impact Dozens of people were killed, and thousands of people injured, in the rioting over April 4 to 5. =Physical= Some areas were heavily damaged by the riots, and recovered slowly. In Washington DC, poor urban planning decisions on the part of the federal and local government were an obstacle to recovery. =Political= Dr. King had campaigned for a federal fair housing law throughout 1966, but had not achieved it. Senator Walter Mondale advocated for the bill in Congress, but noted that over successive years, a fair housing bill was the most filibustered legislation in US history. It was opposed by most Northern and Southern senators, as well as the National Association of Real Estate Boards. Mondale commented that: The riots quickly revived the bill. On April 5, Johnson wrote a letter to the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which included the Fair Housing Act. The Rules Committee, \\"jolted by the repeated civil disturbances virtually outside its door,\\" finally ended its hearings on April 8. With newly urgent attention from White House legislative director Joseph Califano and Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill‚Äîwhich was previously stalled that year‚Äîpassed the House by a wide margin on April 10. =Social= For some liberals and civil rights advocates, the riots were a turning point. They increased an already-strong trend toward racial segregation and white flight in America's cities, strengthening racial barriers that looked as though they might weaken. The riots were political fodder for the Republican party, which used fears of black urban crime to garner support for \\"law and order\\", especially in the 1968 presidential campaign. The assassination and riots radicalized many, helping to fuel the Black Power movement.

Founded in 1963 by Benjamin J. Denihan, Jr., the company is now led by siblings and Co-CEOs Patrick Denihan and Brooke Barrett. DHG is the owner of the Affinia and The James hotel brands, as well as three independent properties: The Benjamin, The Surrey, and The Carlton. The company has plans to open The James Los Angeles - West Hollywood in 2016. History In 1927, Irish immigrant Benjamin Denihan, who had arrived in the United States several years earlier, opened a dry cleaning storefront in Manhattan. In just over a decade, the business had become one of the largest and most exclusive dry cleaners in New York. Ownership eventually passed to Denihan's son, Benjamin J. ‚ÄòBud‚Äô Denihan, Jr. During World War II, as the Denihan men were sent off to fight, the women in the family took over the business and were able to keep it afloat by obtaining contracts for cleaning military uniforms. In the 1950s, Bud Denihan made his first venture into the real estate market, acquiring several residential apartment buildings in New York. A few of his children, including Patrick and Brooke, began working in the new business. In 1963, the family's first hotel, Lyden Gardens, opened on the site of their former dry cleaning plant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The innovative property debuted as the first-ever all-suite hotel. Today, it is the Affinia Gardens hotel. Over the next two decades, the company, initially operating under the name Manhattan East Apartment Hotels before becoming the Manhattan East Suite Hotels, built up its portfolio under Bud's leadership. Upon his death in 1986, ownership passed to six family members: four of Bud's children, a son-in-law, and a nephew. In 1997, the Denihans acquired The Beverly Hotel on 50th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. Two years later, after a massive renovation, it reopened as The Benjamin. Named for the company's founder, The Benjamin was Manhattan East Suite Hotels‚Äô first luxury independent hotel as well as New York's first eco- friendly property. In 2003, Manhattan East Suite Hotels was rebranded Affinia Hospitality Group. The name is derived from the word ‚Äòaffinity.' Five of the company‚Äôs nine New York properties were then rebranded as Affinia Hotels. They are the Affinia Dumont, Affinia 50, Affinia Manhattan, Affinia Shelburne, and Affinia Gardens. Three years later, in 2006, the six owners/managing directors decided to sell the business. Bud Denihan‚Äôs two eldest children, Benjamin ‚ÄòPatrick‚Äô Denihan and Brooke Denihan Barrett, purchased the management company and its core assets in Manhattan, which consisted of the five Affinia properties and The Benjamin, thus becoming the sole owners and Co-CEOs. Later that year, they launched a $532 million recapitalization program to expand their portfolio while diversifying their customer offerings. They also gave the company its current moniker: Denihan Hospitality Group. Also during that year, DHG acquired The James brand, with The James Chicago as its flagship. Included in the purchase is the David Burke Primehouse, located in The James Chicago. In 2007, Denihan was awarded the management contract for the former Holiday Inn on the Hill by LaSalle Hotel Properties in Washington, D.C. This property, which marked the company's first third-party hotel management deal, eventually became The Liaison Capitol Hill, an Affinia Hotel. It opened in 2008 after a $12 million renovation. Art Smith, Oprah Winfrey's former private chef and a two-time James Beard Award winner, partnered with Affinia as the chef of The Liaison's new Art & Soul restaurant. In May 2008, Affinia launched their MyAffinia program, the industry's first service that allows guests to customize their stays in advance of check-in with a variety of amenities, most of which are complimentary. Among the choices are a yoga mat, golf putter, cupcakes, universal chargers, gel eye masks, and much more. That same year, Denihan began a $60 million renovation of The Surrey, a historic residential property less than a block from Central Park on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It would reopen in 2009. Denihan Hospitality Group became the first hotel company to place a direct feed from their Affinia website to TripAdvisor in 2008. In July 2010, Affinia Hotels became a charter member of Stash Hotel Rewards, a new customer loyalty program. Later that year, in September, Denihan launched The James New York in Soho. In November, the company was awarded the management contract for the Royal Palm hotel in Miami, Florida. This property, which is currently undergoing a $43 million renovation, will reopen in October 2012 as The James Royal Palm. Affinia Hotels announced a new service initiative in September 2011 called Tender Loving Comfort (TLC). The program teaches Affinia associates a variety of skills, including how to read guests‚Äô body language to better anticipate their needs and improve a connection with them. Furthermore, guests can join the TLC VIP program, which features a variety of perks, including a VIP room upgrade. In January 2012, Denihan promoted former CFO David Duncan to president of the company, marking the first time a non-family member has held the position. That March, DHG signed management contracts with Ark Partners for two additional boutique hotels in Manhattan: The Mansfield in Midtown and The Franklin on the Upper East Side, bringing the company's New York City portfolio to 11 properties. In April 2012, Denihan announced that they hope to expand to the West Coast, opening a development office in San Francisco.

Particularly in early incarnations, transformational syntax adopted the view that phrase structure grammar must be enriched by a transformational grammar, with syntactic rules or syntactic operations that alter the base structures created by phrase structure rules. In more recent theories, including Government and Binding Theory but especially in Minimalism, the strong distinction between phrase structure and transformational components has largely been abandoned, with operations that build structure (phrase structure rules) and those that change structure (transformational rules) either interleaved, or unified under a single operation (as in the Minimalist operation Merge). Overview According to the Chomskyan tradition, language acquisition is easy for children because they are born with a universal grammar in their minds. The tradition also distinguishes between linguistic competence, what a person knows of a language, and linguistic performance, how a person uses it. Finally, grammars and metagrammars are ranked by three levels of adequacy: observational, descriptive, and explanatory. A core aspect of the original Standard Theory is a distinction between two different representations of a sentence, called deep structure and surface structure. The two representations are linked to each other by a set of transformation rules, the totality of these rules is what constitute grammar, and what a grammatical description of a language should present. Under this theory, a speaker must have access to both structures to interpret an expression. Under this model, syntax was placed in the center of linguistic research and sought to go beyond description. Scholars explored the formalism of syntax and psychology of grammar under this model. This led to more systematic research on linguistic data such as native speaker judgments and distinctions in grammaticality. Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including Andrew Radford,Radford, Andrew (1982).

Big Cartoon DataBase, August 30, 2014  Synopsis  An old hero, Harold, is looking through a photo album with his wife, Emily and remember one picnic they had in the Gay '90s that was interrupted by villain Roger St. Clair, who tries to tempt Emily into going to the city and away from Harold. When that does not work, he takes her by force. Harold is still searching for her six months later. Meanwhile, Emily is forced to sing on the stage of Roger's bar with a barbershop quartet. Harold passes by and notices this. Roger traps Harold with a stage prop, and ties Emily to the railroad tracks. Harold rescues her, but the St. Clair snatches the tied up Emily and carries her to a sawmill. Harold calls for his lover as he entered the mill, but Roger uses a log swing and knocks Harold unconsciously into the conveyor belt that leads to a giant circular saw blade. As St. Clair pulled the lever that could sent his opponent to his doom, Harold's hard head, however, not only destroyed the sawblade, but in the aftermath, multiple saw tools took its place. Frustrated, Roger pulled out a revolver to gun down Harold, but the hero repelled the bullets until the St. Clair ran out of ammunition. The villain uses a nearby lumber board to outwit Harold, but the hero grabs the board with the St. Clair and throws them out bodily, but both the villain and the board flew back at Harold. The brawl continues until Harold defeats Roger, sending the fallen foe into the river, never to be seen again. After the old couple finished looking at the album, Harold wonders whatever happened to the unscrupulous cur; just then, Roger St. Clair has returned, older and still alive. He declares that a St. Clair never gives up and drags Emily away once again. Harold tries to be heroic, but sings the chorus of Poor Old Joe as he leaves the room to rescue his wife.

He also served as Mayor of Santa Fe, New Mexico (1840) and as a member of the first departmental assembly of New Mexico (1843).  Career  In 1840, don Felipe Sena became alcalde primero (Mayor) of Santa Fe. On 23 October 1843 Sena was elected a member of the first departmental assembly of New Mexico. Early in 1844, Governor Manuel Armijo decided to give up active involvement in the governor position, and appointed Mariano Chavez as gobernado interino (acting governor) as of 31 January 1844. Don Mariano Chavez y Castillo resigned on 10 April due to illness. Felipe Sena then became acting governor, although Armijo remained governor. The case of the Maxwell Land Grant came up during his short term of office. This was a huge grant of land that had been made in January 1841 to Guadalupe Miranda of Santa Fe and Charles Beaubien, a French Canadian who had lived in Taos since 1823. The two had promptly deeded a quarter interest in the land to Governor Armijo and a quarter to the trader Charles Bent. Father Antonio Jos√© Mart√≠nez of Taos protested against the grant, which he said encroached on traditional Indian grounds. Mariano Chavez suspended the grant but Sena reinstated the grant. In March 1844, General Santa Anna removed Armijo from office and appointed the commandante militar, Mariano Mart√≠nez de Lejanza, as \\"constitutional governor\\". On 29 April 1844 Sena handed over the office to Martinez. When the Maxwell Land Grant can before Martinez, he denied it on legal grounds. In April 1845 Felipe Sena was President of the Departmental Assembly, involved in the dispute over the Los Manuelitas Grant. Felipe Sena was the great uncle of Colonel Jos√© D.

Life According to another account he had been possibly subsequent to this a Spitalfields weaver in good circumstances. Some time before 1787, having disowned his children 'either from indolence or morbidity,' he became an inmate of Shoreditch workhouse, an allowance of eight shillings a week being contributed to his support by one of his daughters. Discarding his original name, he took that of 'Poor-help,' as descriptive, in self-deprecatory language, of the special mission which his prophetic gifts enabled him to fulfill. He received his visitors in a room adorned with fantastic emblems and devices, and, after inspecting the palms of their hands, professed to give an outline of their past lives, their present circumstances, and their future prospects in verses of Scripture, which he repeated with rapid fluency. He also undertook, by licking the hands of his patients, to discover the disease under which they laboured. Owing to the interest excited in his pretensions, 'Poor-help' removed to a house in Kingsland Road, where he was consulted by many of the upper classes of London, whom he also visited at their own homes. He professed to eat no other food than bread and cheese, and to drink only gin tinctured with rhubarb. At night he found the strength and refreshment he needed for his pretentious daily duties, not in sleep, but in converse with celestial [i.e. heavenly] powers. For the last thirty years of his life he was possessed of the conviction that he should be the leader of the children of Israel to rebuild the city of Jerusalem. He died 7 March 1825, aged 87.

LBS Marg connects the neighbouring city of Thane with Sion in Mumbai. It passes through heavily populated areas of the Eastern Suburbs and is heavily congested. Approximately, 3 lakh vehicles use this road daily. The road is named after Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second Prime Minister of India. Route description LBS Marg begins at Thane, extending from the Old Agra Road and the Ghodbunder Road. It intersects the Eastern Express Highway (EEH) at Marathon Chowk. When travelling between Mumbai and Thane, commuters have to pay a toll. The toll gate (called naaka in Marathi) is called Teen Hath Naaka. LBS Marg then passes through all the eastern suburbs, from Mulund till Sion, where it joins with the EEH near the Sion Flyover. Both LBS Marg and the EEH pass through Thane and the Eastern Suburbs but they pass to the west and east of the Central Line respectively. LBS Marg has only 4 lanes. However, only 2 lanes are in use now due to ongoing metro work. It passes through residential and commercial areas making it more congested and encroached upon. On the other hand, EEH is wide, well-maintained and smooth. It goes through an uninhabited area where development is prohibited. LBS Marg also offers connectivity to the Western Suburbs when it intersects the Andheri ‚Äì Ghatkopar Link Road and the JVLR. The road also intersects the BKC Road at Kurla providing connectivity to the Bandra Kurla Complex, and onward to Bandra. It also offers connectivity to the Harbour Suburbs when it intersects the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR). LBS Marg is connected to Kalina from Kurla via a 6m bridge over the Mithi river. The Mumbai Metro Line 4, which will pass through LBS, is under construction.  Planning  The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has had plans to widen LBS Marg since 1970. The BMC decided to revitalize and finance the project in 2012. The work will require the demolition of 2000 buildings, 80 per cent of which are commercial properties. BMC estimates the cost of acquiring properties for demolition to be . The plan was to widen LBS Marg to 6 lanes (a width of 120 feet) from 4 lanes (60‚Äì80 feet width). However, with metro construction work going on from the stretch from Thane to Ghatkopar, the width of the road has actually reduced in places to just 12 feet on either side.  Current Status  The LBS Road is known for heavy encroachment and almost nil enforcement of traffic and civic rules or town planning guidelines. It is common to see vehicles encroaching footpaths, wrong-side driving by all types of vehicles including heavy goods vehicles and jaywalking in the absence of pedestrian crossings. The ongoing Metro construction work on the central median has resulted in the road width reducing to just 12 feet in certain pockets, with no foothpaths for pedestrian movement. As a result, the vehicular speeds on the road have fallen to an average of 3 km/h (1.8 mph) during peak hours. In addition, the road has the highest number of flood-prone spots in the Eastern suburbs, with yearly flooding a common phenomenon.  Real Estate  R City Mall on LBS Marg in Ghatkopar. Phoenix MarketCity on LBS Marg in Kurla (West) Conversion from primarily an industrial region to a mixed-use area began in the 2000s. LBS Marg has several malls, apartment complexes and corporate offices along it. Some of Mumbai's most prominent malls ‚Äì R-Mall (Mulund), Neptune Magnet Mall (Bhandup), R City Mall (Ghatkopar) and Phoenix Marketcity (Kurla) ‚Äì are located on LBS Marg. Godrej and Boyce IT Park, located in Vikhroli, houses the offices of several IT firms. Corporates like Accenture, Capgemini, TCS, Wipro, WNS Spectramind, ICICI Prudential, HCC, Colgate-Palmolive and Cipla have offices on LBS Marg. Godrej Park Site and Raj Legacy in Vikhroli, Kalpataru Aura and The Address in Ghatkopar, and HDIL's Dreams and Whispering Towers in Bhandup are some notable residential complexes on LBS Marg. Some manufacturing facilities continue to exist on or near LBS Road, notably Johnson & Johnson (Mulund), Ceat Tyres, Asian Paints and ShangriLa Biscuits (Bhandup), Jai Hind Oil Mills (Kanjurmarg), Everest Spices and Godrej Industries (Vikhroli).

It had a magnitude that was measured at 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale and 7.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale. It had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter was located in Zhaotong prefecture in Yunnan province and it caused between 1,641 and 20,000 deaths. Earthquake The earthquake has been ascribed to slip on a thrust fault trending north-south with a dip of 60¬∞ to the east, from geodetic data analysis. It has also been interpreted to result from strike-slip faulting along a steeply-dipping NW-SE trending fault. The isoseismal lines for the earthquake were poorly defined, due to variations both in topography and ground conditions. The earthquake consisted of more than ten separate sub- events. The sequence began with a few shocks in the first two to three seconds with magnitudes less than 5. These were followed by several shocks approaching magnitude 7 over a period of about a minute. The areal distribution of the individual shocks showed no progression along the fault plane as would be expected with a propagating fracture. The earthquake triggered many landslides in the epicentral area. The bedrock geology in the area contains rocks of almost all ages from Neoproterozoic through to Quaternary. Landslides were mainly confined to areas that experienced intensities of VII or greater and had slopes of moderate dip (26¬∞-45¬∞). In all but one case, the landslides involved Quaternary material, the exception being a slide that was controlled by bedding planes in a Permian limestone. Rock avalanches occurred on steeper slopes, particularly affecting jointed and weathered Permian limestone and Triassic sandstone/shale sequences. Damage An area of about 400,000 square kilometres was affected by the earthquake. 28,000 houses collapsed and a further 38,000 were damaged. Houses with wooden frames in the epicentral area remained undamaged. The number of deaths reported varies from 1,641 to 20,000 with a further 1,600 injured. The largest landslide formed a dam up to 30 m high across the Yangtze River, turning the valley above it into a lake.

Ness and Ellen Malcolm, 2015 Vice President Vicki Shabo, May 2014 The National Partnership for Women & Families is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 501(c)3 organization based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1971, the National Partnership works on public policies, education and outreach that focuses on women and families. History The National Partnership for Women & Families was known as the Women's Legal Defense Fund (WLDF) until 1998. Judith L. Lichtman was hired as the National Partnership's first paid staff member in 1974. Lichtman became president in 1988 and served in the role for 16 years. Lichtman is currently the organization's senior advisor. The current president, Debra L. Ness, joined the National Partnership as executive vice president in 1991 and assumed the role of president in 2004. The organization is best known for its work to build support for, pass, protect and expand the Family and Medical Leave Act ‚Äì the first and only national law guaranteeing eligible workers job-protected, unpaid leave to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, seriously ill family member, or to recover from their own serious health conditions. Issues & Campaigns The National Partnership works on four main issues: # Health care ‚Äì increasing access, improving quality and ensuring the affordability of health care # Reproductive rights ‚Äì ensuring women have access to the full range of reproductive health services # Workplace fairness ‚Äì expanding and restoring civil rights protections that promote equal opportunity and justice in the workplace and society # Family friendly workplace policies ‚Äì expanding workers' access to job-protected paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, flex-time, and more Current projects include a national paid sick days campaign, the Campaign for Better Care, and the Americans for Quality Health Care initiative. The National Partnership provides technical support to Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q), a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Mission statement \\"We believe that actions speak louder than words, and for more than four decades we have fought for every major policy advance that has helped women and families. Today, we promote fairness in the workplace, reproductive health and rights, access to quality affordable health care, and policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and family.\\" Impact and Achievements In 1977, the National Partnership litigated and achieved a significant victory in Barnes v. Costle, a U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that any retaliation by a boss against an employee for rejecting sexual advances violates Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination. Laws the National Partnership helped enact include: the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as well as national child support reforms in 1988. In 2009, the National Partnership helped lead efforts to enact the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, a repeal of the global gag rule, and passage of economic security and health information technology provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The National Partnership provided technical assistance and expert testimony in support of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The National Partnership provides national leadership and technical assistance to city and state level campaigns and has driven or supported efforts to enact paid sick days laws in San Francisco (2006), the District of Columbia (2008) and the state of Connecticut (2011), as well as paid family leave laws in the states of California (2002), Washington (2007) and New Jersey (2008). In 2011, the organization won the Convio Innovator Award for Best Online Campaign. Notable Supporters First Lady Michelle Obama is a two-time speaker at National Partnership events. In 2011, she said that the National Partnership is \\"one of the most influential organizations for women and families in our country,\\" and has had an \\"amazing imprint on nearly every single one of this nation's major policy achievements for women and families.\\" Secretary of State and former First Lady Hillary Clinton has been twice honored by the National Partnership, in 1994 and 2012. In 2012 she said of the National Partnership, \\"For more than 40 years, you've been protecting the most vulnerable among us and holding us all to account when we are not living up to our own American values. And in the process, you improve the lives of countless women and help make that future a better place for them and their children.\\" Previous speakers at National Partnership events include: former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, journalists Christiane Amanpour and Ellen Goodman, historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, media artists Allison Janney, Anna Deavere Smith, Rob Reiner, and Rosie O'Donnell, activist Marian Wright Edelman, and UNICEF Director Carol Bellamy.

He served in several of England's expeditions against the French and their allies in the vicinity of Fort Duquesne and later Fort Pitt. Born in the Scottish Highlands, Fraser, age 14, arrived in Pennsylvania and settled for a short time near the Susquehanna River in Dauphin County. He next moved west over the Allegheny Mountains to establish an English trading post at the Native American village of Venango (now Franklin, Pennsylvania), at the junction of French Creek and the Allegheny River. For some ten years there he bartered his gunsmith services, English manufactured goods, and alcohol, in exchange for Indian pelts and furs. In 1749 French expeditionary activity led by Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville forced Fraser to abandon Venango and move south to the Forks of the Ohio. At the mouth of Turtle Creek (Monongahela River) he built a new cabin, from which to trade with the Indians once again. There he aided George Washington and his guide Christopher Gist during Washington's early diplomacy with the French. (According to Washington's 1753 journal, by this time Fraser's cabin at Venango flew the French colors; by the next year both the Venango cabin and its forge had been incorporated by the French into the new Fort Machault.) During the French and Indian War Fraser served in colonial and British uniform, against the French, under Captain William Trent, George Washington, General Edward Braddock, and General John Forbes. Fraser's Turtle Creek cabin stood through the Battle of the Monongahela and for decades more, until about 1804. The site today is located in North Braddock, Pennsylvania on the land where, since 1872, sits the Edgar Thomson Steel Works established by Andrew Carnegie. Fraser, who petitioned the government for restitution for his losses during his war service, also speculated in land purchases on the frontier. He was granted 300 acres near Fort Ligonier along the Forbes Road in 1766. On April 1, 1769 he successfully purchased all of Braddock's Field as well as the cabin he had built there. Fraser married Jane Fraser (formerly Jane Bell and Jane McClain) in 1754. On October 1, 1755, while returning to her home from the Fort Cumberland trading post several miles away, Jane was captured by Indians and taken to the Miami River near Dayton, Ohio. She eventually escaped and returned 18 months later only to learn that Fraser, her husband, had remarried because he assumed that she was dead. Fraser took her back, and he returned his second wife home to her father. Ruby Frazier Frey, a descendant, in 1946 published an historical novel, Red Morning, telling of Jane‚Äôs experiences. In 1771 John Fraser was appointed by Governor Penn as a justice of the peace for the newly formed Bedford County, Pennsylvania, where two years later he died suddenly. The Orphan's Court ruled that his widow Jane Fraser should sell some of the Fraser land to satisfy debts and to support her eight minor children. On October 14, 1774, Braddock's battlefield sold to Daniel Razior. In 1790 his 300 acres near Fort Ligonier sold to Father Theodore Brouwers, O.F.M., who founded there the first Catholic Church parish west of the Alleghenies, and by 1846 Saint Vincent College and Saint Vincent Archabbey was established (now the oldest Benedictine monastery in the United States). In 18th century documents his surname is spelled three ways: Frazer, Frazier, and Fraser. Fraser is the common Scottish spelling of the name and is used by many of John Fraser's descendants.

The habitation was situated between Auchentiber and Stewarton on the B778. It was originally built as a row of housing for crofters and farm workers. A small school remained open for some years after the hamlet ceased to exist.  History  Bloak School would have looked similar to the nearby old Hessilhead School. The 1779 estate map of the Lainshaw Estate shows the hamlet of Bloak with the fields of South Crofts and North Crofts lying below Bowhouse Farm. Eight buildings are shown on either side of the road and located as far as the junction of the road to Kennox.Crawford Bloak was once part of the 'Lands of Kirkwood' that formed a small estate in the Parish of Stewarton, East Ayrshire lying between Stewarton and Dunlop, which in 1678 became part of the lands of Lainshaw, known as the Lainshaw, Kirkwood and Bridgehouse Estate. Kirkwood was anciently known as Bloak Cunninghame.Lainshaw, Page 253 Bloak seems to have been a typical 'Farm Town', the origins of which lie in the common medieval sub-division of land called a 'ploughgate' (104 acres), this being the extent of land which one plough team of oxen could till in a year. This area was again subdivided into four plots known as 'husbandlands', each of 26 acres (110,000 m2). A husbandland could sustain and provide two oxen, and eight oxen were need for a plough-team. This arrangement led to small farm towns like Bloak being established with accommodation for at least four men and their families, living in six to eight houses. A similar hamlet or clachan still survives at Hessilhead, which also had a small school until around 1900.Dickinson, Page 218. =Cartographic evidence= Blaeu's edition of Timothy Pont's map of circa 1604 shows a Blook and Blook Mill.Blaeu's map Retrieved : 2012-07-17 In 1747 the settlement of Blook is indicated on Roy's map.Roy's Map Retrieved : 2012-07-17 On Armstrong's map of 1775 shows a Bloate near Kirkwood.Armstrong's map Retrieved : 2012-07-17 Johnson's map of 1828 marks Bloak as a group of four buildings at Bowhouse Farm road end.Johnson Thomson's map of 1832 shows Bloak.Thomson's map Retrieved : 2012-07-17 A hamlet of around eight dwellings and a school are shown in 1858 with further dwellings at Bloakholmes.

He was a specialist hurdler but also won steeplechases and races on the flat. In a racing career which lasted from November 1988 until December 1995, he ran forty-five times and won twenty races including the Champion Hurdle in 1991 and the Aintree Hurdle on four successive occasions. He won the title of American Champion Steeplechase Horse on two occasions, as a result of back-to-back wins in the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase. Background Morley Street was a chestnut horse with a large white star, bred in Ireland by Marshall Parkhill. He was sired by Deep Run, an outstanding sire of jumpers whose other progeny included Dawn Run and Golden Cygnet. Morley Street's dam, High Board, was not a Thoroughbred, being a descendant of the mare Arab Maid, whose pedigree on her mother's side was uncertain. Arab Maid's other descendants included the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Easter Hero. Two years after Morley Street was foaled, High Board produced his full brother Granville Again, who won the Champion Hurdle in 1993. Morley Street was bought as an unraced three-year-old by the British businessman Michael Jackson, who first raced the horse in the name of his Salehurst Paper Company. The horse was named after a street close to Jackson's Salehurst office, near London Waterloo station. He was trained throughout his career by Toby Balding at Kimpton in Hampshire and was ridden in most of his important races by Jimmy Frost. Morley Street suffered throughout his career from bleeding. Balding treated the horse with a variety of substances including Lasix but was banned under British racing rules from using medication on race days. Racing career =1988-1990: early career= Morley Street began his racing career by winning a National Hunt Flat race at Sandown Park Racecourse on 5 November 1988. He was then campaigned in Novice Hurdles (races for horses which have not won a hurdle race before the start of the season), and won races at Sandown, Newbury and Ascot. In March, he was sent to the Cheltenham Festival to contest the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle. He started 5/1 second favourite and finished fourth of the twenty-two runners behind Sayfar's Lad, Trapper John and Knight Oil. At Aintree Racecourse a month later, Morley Street recorded his first major win when he defeated Trapper John by one and a half lengths in the Mumm Prize Novices' Hurdle. In the first half of the 1989/1990 season, Morley Street ran in three hurdle races, winning once and finishing second in the other two. His victory came in a leg of the Sport of Kings challenge series, in which the beaten horses included the leading American steeplechaser Jamaica Bay. At Cheltenham in March, Morley Street made his first challenge for the Champion Hurdle. He started at odds of 10/1 in a field which included the previous champions Beech Road and See You Then, and finished fifth of the nineteen runners behind Kribensis. Following his run in the Champion Hurdle, Jackson transferred the ownership of Morley Street his Michael Jackson Bloodstock company. In April, he returned to Aintree for the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles and started odds-on favourite. He took the lead at the last hurdle and accelerated clear to win by fifteen lengths. =1990-1993: peak years= The 1990/1991 season was intended to be the one in which Morley Street would establish himself as a steeplechaser. He warmed up for the season by having his first race under Flat racing rules, in which he recorded an upset win over St Leger winner Michelozzo in a race at Goodwood Racecourse in early October. In an unusual move, he was then sent across the Atlantic for the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase at Belmont Park where the obstacles were larger than British hurdles, but smaller than British steeplechase fences. Morley Street won his biggest prize to date as he beat the Jonathan E. Sheppard-trained Summer Colony by eleven lengths. On his return to England, Morley Street won the Ascot Hurdle by three lengths and a Novices' Chase at Cheltenham, in which he beat the future Champion Chaser Deep Sensation by seven lengths. Morley Street's five-race winning streak came to an end at Ascot in December when he was beaten by Remittance Man in the Noel Novices' Chase after repeatedly jumping to the left on a right-handed course. Despite his defeat, he was made favourite for the Grade I Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton, but jumped poorly again and was pulled up after breaking a blood-vessel. In February, he was voted American Champion Steeplechaser at the Eclipse Awards. Morley Street was returned to hurdle racing after a break and won the Grade II Berkshire Hurdle at Newbury in March before running in his second Champion Hurdle. He started 4/1 favourite in a field of twenty-four runners. Frost sent Morley Street into the lead between the last two hurdles, and the gelding ran on in the closing stages to win by one and a half lengths from Nomadic Way. On his final start of the season, Morley Street won a second Aintree Hurdle, beating Nomadic Way by six lengths. In the late summer of 1991, Morley Street briefly returned to Flat racing. He ran poorly in the Lonsdale Stakes at York but showed top-class staying form when finishing second by a short head to Great Marquess in the Doncaster Cup. In October, he was again sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Chase, run at Fair Hill Racecourse. He started odds-on favourite and won by nine and three quarter lengths from Declare Your Wish in a course record time. The performance was enough to earn him a second Eclipse award. Morley Street won a second Ascot Hurdle in November and was then rested until February when he ran in the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse. He started odds-on favourite but was narrowly beaten by the locally trained Chirkpar. He started 2/1 favourite for the Champion Hurdle, with his younger brother Granville Again being the 9/2 second choice in the betting. Morley Street was in contention two hurdles from the finish, but failed to quicken and ran sixth behind Royal Gait. He ended the season with a third victory in the Aintree Hurdle, beating the Irish mare Minorettes Girl by half a length. Morley Street won a flat race at Doncaster in October, and then began the new National Hunt season by beating Granville Again in the Elite Hurdle at Cheltenham in November. He failed to run up to his best form when finishing second as odds-on favourite in the Ascot Hurdle and was then beaten in races at Cheltenham and Sandown. In his third Champion Hurdle, he made no impression and finished twelfth behind Granville Again. In the Aintree Hurdle, Granville Again was made 10/11 favourite, and journalists predicted \\"further humiliation\\" for the former champion. Morley Street, however, returned to his best and defeated his younger brother by one and a half lengths. The win made him the first horse to win the Grade I race on four occasions. =1993-1995: later career= After his win at Aintree in April 1993, Morley Street never won again. A return to steeplechasing in late 1993 brought no success, and he was pulled up in the 1994 Champion Hurdle. He was unplaced in four flat races in 1994 and finished fourth when sent to compete in a hurdle race at Merano in Italy that autumn. After spending a year in retirement at his owner's farm in East Sussex, Morley Street became restless and was returned to training. In November 1995, he showed some signs of a return when finishing third in the Ascot Hurdle, but was retired after finishing unplaced in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot a month later. Retirement Morley Street died at the age of twenty-five on 26 February 2009.

The novel's protagonist is a recluse who, convinced that the world will end soon, takes up residence in an abandoned mine and then attempts to sell tickets to his \\"ark\\" to people he deems worthy of saving from the apocalypse. The novel was originally published in 1984; the English translation by Juliet Winters Carpenter was released in 1988. Plot summary The novel begins with the protagonist, who calls himself Mole, going to a flea market in order to find people to live aboard his \\"ark,\\" an abandoned mine that he has outfitted so that it will withstand the nuclear holocaust that he predicts is imminent. His eye is caught by a man selling insects called clockbugs. The insect dealer has two shills, or sakura as they are known in Japanese, working for him, one an aggressive, impulsive young man, and the other a sly but attractive woman. When Mole offers the insect dealer a ticket aboard his ark, it is stolen by the shills. After chasing the pair of them back to the ark, Mole and the insect dealer discover that the shills are not the only intruders: other unseen, unwelcome people have been prowling the dark corridors as well. Mole comes to accept the presence of the two shills in exchange for their help in repelling the intruders. But his fantasy of having power over the other residents of the \\"ark\\" unwinds as matters become more and more complex. As a brigade of old men, a band of school girls, and a group of wayward youths all come to occupy the hull of the \\"ark,\\" Mole is forced to abandon his creation, his sanctum breached and his heart broken by the female sakura who rejects his advances. Style In his review of the novel for The New York Times, Edmund White described The Ark Sakura as dreamlike \\"in the strictest sense,\\"\\"Round and Round the Eupcaccia Goes\\", by Edmund White praising its scope and the level of detail of the novel. The novel delves deep into the strange ideas and predilection of its narrator. But it also serves as a haunting exploration of modern life in Japan and what it means to be an outcast.

Classification  Aerococcus urinae is a member of the bacterial genus Aerococcus. The bacterium is a Gram-positive, catalase- negative coccus growing in clusters. Isolates of this genus were originally isolated in 1953 from samples collected in the air and dust of occupied rooms and were distinguished by their tetrad cellular arrangements. Later, it was found in the urine of patients with urinary tract infections and in 1992, A. urinae was assigned as distinct species. Due to difficulties in the biochemical identification of A. urinae in clinical microbiological laboratories, the incidence of infections with this bacterium has likely been underestimated and secure identification relies on genetic techniques like 16S ribosomal subunit sequencing or mass spectroscopic methods such as MALDI-TOF.  Clinical relevance  A. urinae may also cause invasive infections including urosepsis and infective endocarditis, especially in elderly men with underlying urinary tract diseases. A. urinae is sensitive to many commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins, and vancomycin. Nitrofurantoin has been reported to be effective in one series of 42 clinical isolates. The bacterium can form biofilms on foreign materials and can aggregate human platelets, two features of potential importance for the disease causing capacity of this organism. A. urinae is the most common aerococcus isolated from invasive human infections whereas Aerococcus sanguinicola is isolated from human urine as often as A. urinae.
