D. Bajpai, Abhinav Publications, 2004, p.105 They are not known to have been satraps nor kings, and their coins only bear their name without any title, therefore they are sometimes simply called \\"the Mitra rulers of Mathura\\". Alternatively, they have been dated from 100 BCE to 20 BCE.On the Cusp of an Era: Art in the Pre-Kuṣāṇa World, Doris Srinivasan BRILL, 2007, p.320 The Mitra dynasty was replaced by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps from around 60 BCE. Some sources consider that the Mitra dynasty ruled at a later date, during the 1st or 2nd century CE, and that they ruled from Mathura to Saketa, where they replaced the Deva dynasty.Ayodhya Revisited by Kunal Kishore p.24 In addition to the Mitra dynasties of Saketa (Kosala kingdom) and Mathura, there were Mitra dynasties in Ahichchhatra (Panchala kingdom) and Kaushambi (Vatsa kingdom). During the 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE, the Mitras of Kaushambi also appear to have extended their hegemony over Magadha (including Pataliputra), and possibly Kannauj as well. The dynasty Seven rulers of Mathura are known: * Gomitra * Gomitra II * Brahmamitra * Dridhamitra * Suryamitra * Vishnumitra * Satyamitra These rulers are never mentioned as \\"Kings\\" or Raja on their coins: there is therefore a possibly that they may only have been local rulers and vassals to larger king. Gomitra II and Brahmamitra especially are known for their large number of coins, which is not so much the case for other rulers. In the archaeological excavations of Sonkh, near Mathura, archaeological levels of the Mitra rulers were identified. Coins of the Mitra dynasty were found in Sonkh especially, in layers dated to about 150-50 BCE. The earliest Mitra coins are those of Gomitra (150-50 BCE). Relation with the Indo-Greeks Coin of Menander I with elephant and Heraklian club. From numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence, it seems that the Indo-Greeks had control over Mathura at some time, especially during the rule of Menander I (165–135 BCE). The control of Mathura seems to have continued for some time under the successors of Menander, with Strato I, Antimachus and Apollodotus II, where they were facing the territory of the Sungas. Coins of Menander and Strato can be found in the area of Mathura, and Ptolemy records Menander as having ruled as far as Mathura (Μόδουρα) in Book VII, I, 47 of his Geographia. An inscription in Mathura discovered in 1988 mentions \\"The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (Yavanarajya)\\", also attesting presence of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd century BCE. The inscription would date to the 116th year of the Yavana era (thought to start in 186–185 BCE) which would give it a date of 70 or 69 BCE. The Yavanarajya inscription reads:Published in \\"L'Indo-Grec Menandre ou Paul Demieville revisite,\\" Journal Asiatique 281 (1993) p.113 The Yavanarajya inscription, dated to \\"year 116 of Yavana hegemony\\", probably 70 or 69 BCE. Mathura Museum. The Indo-Greeks may have been supplanted by Indo-Scythians around that date, who would then rule in Mathura as the Northern Satraps. From this time also (circa 150 BCE), archaeological research at Mathura reports an important growth of the city and extensive building of fortifications. Stone sculptures in Mathura are also known from this period onwards, although Indo- Greek artistic influence cannot be readily seen. Given the suggestions of Greek presence and control concomitantly with the rule of the Mitra dynasty in the same time frame (150–50 BCE), it is therefore thought that there may have been a sort of tributary relationship between the Mitra dynasty and the Indo- Greeks to the west. Numerous coins of Rajuvula have been found in company with the coins of the Strato group in the Eastern Punjab (to the east of the Jhelum) and also in the Mathura area.Mathurā and Its Society: The ʼSakæ- Pahlava Phase, Bratindra Nath Mukherjee, Firma K.L.M., 1981, p.9 Shungas to the east It is thought that the Shungas did not rule in Mathura. The period in which the Mitra dynasty ruled in Mathura roughly corresponds to the Hindu Sunga dynasty (180 BCE–80 BCE), however it doesn't seem that the Shungas ruled in Mathura or Surasena since no Shunga coins or inscriptions have been found there.History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 The Mitra dynasty was replaced by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps around 60 BCE. \\"Datta\\" rulers of Mathura Another dynasty of local rulers, named the \\"Datta kings\\" is also known to have ruled in Mathura.History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.170 These rulers are known as Seshadatta, Ramadatta, Sisuchandradatta and Sivadatta.Dimensions of Human Cultures in Central India, A. A. Abbasi, Sarup & Sons, 2001, p.145-146 The coins of Ramadatta usually represent a Lakshmi standing, and facing elephants.

The movement was spearheaded by the Cameroonian Peoples Union (UPC). Even after independence, the rebellion continued, shaping contemporary politics. The war began with riots in 1955 and continued after Cameroon gained independence in 1960. Following independence, the first President of Cameroon, Ahmadou Ahidjo requested continued French military intervention to fight the UPC rebels. The UPC rebellion was largely crushed by the Cameroonian Armed Forces and French Army by 1964.Teretta, Meredith. \\"Nation of Outlaws, State of Violence: Nationalism, Grassfields Tradition, and State Building in Cameroon\\". Athens OH: Ohio University Press. Page 178-179. This war is often forgotten because it occurred at the height of France's biggest colonial independence struggle, the Algerian War. The war is believed to have produced some 61,300 to 76,300 civilian deaths, according to estimates from the British embassy assembled in 1964, with 80% of the dead being from the Bamileke Region. General Max Briand, the commander of all French military forces in Cameroon, gave an estimate of 20,000 people killed in the Bamileke Region in 1960 alone. Some modern estimates for deaths go into the hundreds of thousands or even millions, but are believed to not be reliable. Overall, estimating the number of deaths is difficult as the French administration did not keep meticulous records of the number of people killed.  Causes of war  Cameroon's own movement began in the early 1950s, after the founding of the Cameroon Peoples Union (UPC), Cameroon's first and most prominent nationalist party. The party was centered around two main goals: separating from France and establishing a socialist economy. The party was founded in 1948 by Ruben Um Nyobe and his colleague, Felix-Roland Moumie. The burgeoning nationalist movement was met with the challenge of a colonial administration that wanted to neutralize it. In a letter that was written to the colonial high commission in 1954, Um Nyobe wrote: > “For six years, the Union of Cameroonian People has resisted and will > continue to resist violent hostility from French colonial authorities. One > must write a book to cover the inventory of forces and structures of power > that were used to combat our organization” Um Nyobe's words allude to the tensions that existed between the nationalist movement and the colonial administration. Attempts to thwart the nationalist movement were not unique to Cameroon, but rather a natural extension of French colonial politics at the time. The French colonial administration's efforts to suppress UPC led to a brutal civil war.  Elites and the war  For many Cameroonian nationalists, embroiling oneself in the war was not an immediate inclination. In fact, many attempted to cooperate and participate democratically in the French colonial political system. Many of these were Cameroonians who had fully assimilated French law, language, and customs and were called Evolue. They admired the French lifestyle and denigrated local mores. Yet, some of Cameroon's early revolutionaries would qualify as evolue. Likewise, candidats administratifs were candidates that were favored by the colonial administrations. This practice was first introduced in Cameroon in 1945 when the colonial government was looking to create a class of proteges. During a provisional election, they placed Chief Andre Fouda against popular anti-colonialist Douala Manga Bell. The colonial administration favored Fouda and worked to ensure his victory.  Um Nyobe's leadership  Even members of the UPC tried to participate in the French political process at first. During legislative elections in June 1951, Ruben Um Nyobe presented himself to electors. To hinder Um Nyobe's chances, the colonial administration waited until the last minute to accept Nyobe's candidacy. The administration also employed methods of voter suppression. Regions in which Nyobe's popularity was high, had few voting offices. This forced Nyobe's supporters to travel long distances just to cast their votes. Nyobe ended up losing the election, winning only 3,100 votes. Frustrated by election results and other injustices plaguing the country, Nyobe took to the international stage. He defended three times (1952, 1953, and 1954) the cause of independent Cameroon before the General Assembly of the United Nations. In his speeches, Nyobe denounced French colonial rule and called for the unification of British and French Cameroon. The UPC's growing popularity became a threat for the French, and left latitude for other conflicts.  War chronology  On April 22, 1955, the UPC published the \\"Proclamation Commune,\\" which at the time, was considered a unilateral independence manifesto. However, the colonial administration viewed it as an unnecessary provocation. Slowly, the French began to focus their energies on quelling the UPC movement, by stifling its leaders and their supporters. By May 1955, Um Nyobe and his peers went into hiding. On May 22, 1955, pro-independence riots broke out in Cameroon's major cities, Douala and Yaounde. These riots would continue on until May 30, 1955 when they were shut down by new French Colonial High Commissioner, Roland Pre. Following the riots, on July 13, 1955, French authorities officially banned the UPC. In the Sanaga-Maritime, the region of the country that contains the nation's largest cities Douala and Yaounde, the French Administration repressed these riots. On December 18, 1956, the UPC began boycotting legislative elections. They enacted a “zone de maintien de l’ordre” at Sanaga-Maritime to squash nationalist upheaval. This designation gave the French the authority to exert any military force on Cameroonians living in Sanaga-Maritime. In retaliation, the UPC established an armed branch of their party called Organizational National Committee (CNO). From this moment, the war had officially begun. As tensions heightened, the French quickly tried to retain order in the area. They brought in a lieutenant colonel, Jean Lamberton, from French Indochine to lead these efforts. From December 9, 1957, through 1958, Lamberton enacted what was known was the Cameroon Pacification Zone (ZoPac). In this zone, locals were placed into camps and surveilled by the colonial army. The culmination of this pacification program was Um Nyobe's assassination in September 1958. From January 18, 1957, to May 25, 1959, French authorities installed a similar martial zone in western regions of Cameroon. This region of the country is home to two of the nation's largest ethnic groups, the Bamileke and the Bassa. Localizing the conflict within the Bamileke region also served to quell the power of Bamileke elites. However, Bamileke and Bassa forces continually challenged the French rule. In January 1959, the Cameroonian Liberation Army began fighting for Cameroon to become an independent nation. From this moment, the Cameroonians and the French were engaged in a fully fledged war. On January 1, 1960, Cameroon gained independence, and Ahmadou Ahidjo became the nation's first President. = War Crimes = Both the rebels, Cameroonian military and the French military committed war crimes during the conflict.

It was created at private initiative but was taken over by the state in 1758. Its former building at Nybrogade 2 was expanded by Philip de Lange in 1762. It is now home to the Ministry of Culture. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Early history= Assistenshuset was created at the initiative of the merchant Nicolai Wesling. He aplided Danish Chancellery for a royal privilege yp påerate a æpanbroking establishment with inspiration from abroad. On 3 August 1688, Christian V issued a royal ordinance for the establishment of an \\"Assistance House\\". Wesling's pawn shop was located in a building at the corner of Nyhavn and Kvæsthusgade. He died in November 1698. His widow, Maren Iversdatter, received permission to continue the operations on 31 January 1698 but died just a few months later. The license was then passed on to Diderik Frandsen Klevenow who moved the pawn shop to a property in Frederiksborggade. In 1699, it was decided that part of the profits should be allocated to Børnehuset and the city's poorhouses. When Klenenows died on 1 June 1711, the license was taken over by the German nobleman Johan Otto Raben and his wife Emerentzia von Levetzau, who had been his partners and wanted to secure their investment. They moved the pawn shop to Amagertorv 49 (now Amagertorv 25/Læderstræde 28) where it was managed by Jacob Lindemann. Raben died in 1719 and his widow then operated the pawn shop alone until the license was passed on to their son Christian Frederik Raben and his wife Birthe von Plessen in 1731. In 1737, Iver Jentoft took over the license only to pass it on to two Jewish brothers from Altona, Salomon and Meyer Joseph Unna, who moved the pawn shop to a no longer existing building at present day No. 12 in Snaregade. The establishment was declared bankrupt in 1749 with 150,000 Danish rigsdaler in debts. =The royal pawnbroking establishment= The Royal Pawn (right) and Pæretræet in 1840 After a turbulent period with several competing applicants, the license was taken over by director of Søkvæsthuset and councilman Steffen Heger and merchant Diderich Munch and Assistenshuset was converted into a state-run establishment under Søkvæsthuset by royal ordinance of 29 June 1753 (Forordning om Assistantz-Huuset i Kiøbenhavn 29. juni 1753). It was now moved to a building at the corner of Store Færgestræde (now Højbro Plads) and Store Kirkestræde. The opening hours were eight to 12 am and 14 to 19 p, pm Sundays in the summer time and nine to 13 and 14 to 16 pm in the winter time. The new manager was Jens Hansen Løwe who had also worked for the old pawn shop. Louis Aumont: Pawn Gouse manager Holm In 1758, Assistenshuset moved to a three- winged building at the corner of Nybrogade, Manoløs and Snaregade. It had been constructed for mayor Christian Bjerregård in 1730-32 after his house at the site had been destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1729. His son sold the property to Adrian Kiøbke in 1754. In 1644m it had been acquired by two French hatters, Jean Jaques Douihac and Jaques Cuny, who had used it for manufacture and sale of hats. The Royal Pawn viewed from Gammel Strand in 1907 In 1765, Assistenshuset commissioned Philip de Lange to expand the complex with a new wing on Nybrogade. The neighbouring building, known as Pæretræet, was acquired by the institution in 1792. It was used as residence for its director. In the 1850s and 1860s, Assistenshuset was subject to public criticism and several participants in the public debate argued in favour of a liberalization of the pawnbroling market. The institution was separated from Søkvæsthuet in 1860 and the regulation was revised several times. =Late years and closure= The Total Pawn viewed from Gammel Strand in 1907 In 1935, Assistenshuset achieved a de facto monopoly on pawnbroking. In 1961, Assistenshuset's head office moved to Svanevej in Børrebro and its nine branch offices closed. Assistenshuset closed in 1975. The building today Assistenshuset's former building at Nybrogade was taken over by the Ministry of Culture in 1962.

The election was won by MP Keith Holyoake.  Background  By 1956 Sidney Holland’s health was beginning to fail. His memory began to deteriorate and he lost much energy which he needed for work. In October 1956 he suffered either a mild heart attack or stroke while working in his office during the Suez Crisis. The following year a group of senior cabinet ministers led by Keith Holyoake, Jack Marshall, Jack Watts and party president, Alex McKenzie, persuaded Holland (who was reluctant to go) to resign citing his health deterioration. Holland announced his retirement from the leadership at the National's annual conference in Christchurch on 12 August 1957. Almost immediately after finishing his speech he collapsed backstage and was rushed to hospital by an ambulance.  Candidates  = Keith Holyoake = Holyoake was a senior member of Holland's government. He served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Marketing. He had been seen for years as a potential leader and was often predicted to be the one to succeed Adam Hamilton as National's leader, however he was hampered in this after losing his seat in the 1938 election. = Others = The only other possible successor to Holland was his Minister of Labour, Bill Sullivan. He was seen as leadership material being straight-talking, tough, energetic and resolute and when Holland's health began to fail Sullivan was speculated as being a possible Prime Minister. However Sullivan had resigned from Parliament in February 1957, following the death of his son Bruce, ruling out the possibility of a candidature.  Result  Holland named Holyoake as his preferred successor as party leader upon his resignation and in the following caucus meeting he was unanimously elected as National's third party leader. Holyoake's elevation to the leadership left the deputy spot vacant. Attorney-General Jack Marshall defeated Minister of Finance Jack Watts for the position.  Aftermath  Holyoake served as Prime Minister for two months before the general election that year, making only modest changes to cabinet. After Holland's resignation he was knighted and made a Minister without portfolio by Holyoake before retiring from Parliament at the 1957 election, which National went on to lose, claiming 39 seats to Labour's 41.

Phase 1 of the ECEC is Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) which had been approved by the ADB board in October 2016. The ECEC running along the entire east coast of India from Kolkata to Kanyakumari, is a multimodal, regional maritime corridor that can play a vital role in unifying the large domestic market, as well as integrating the Indian economy with the dynamic global value chains of Southeast and East Asia. http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=159935 It would play a crucial role in the Government of India’s (GoI) Make in India campaign and also supports the port-led industrialization strategy under the Sagar Mala initiative and the Act East Policy by linking domestic companies with the vibrant global production networks of East and Southeast Asia. ECEC stretches about 2,500 kilometers along India's eastern coast—from Kolkata in the north to Kanyakumari in the south—traversing the four states of West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. With major rail trunk lines, a string of ports, national highways, and major utility transmission routes with a large population base, ECEC has great potential as a prominent growth corridor connecting a hinterland of major agriculture belt and resource base with the manufacturing hub of southeast India. With its long coastline and strategically-located ports, ECEC allows multiple international gateways to integrate India with international trade and global value chains (GVCs). ECEC encompasses several centers of economic activity, covering not only the resource-rich, but also the poorest regions. Linking the lagging regions with the growing and well-established industrial clusters will help create job opportunities for the poor. To stimulate economic activities in other emerging clusters and distribute growth within the region, efficient multi-modal transport is necessary. The presence of a strong information and communication technology (ICT) industry in Kolkata, Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, and Chennai can also lend support to ECEC’s communications network; provide a platform for skills development in other related service sectors; and facilitate implementation of e-governance systems for maintenance, monitoring, and evaluation of corridor development activities.  Background  India has experienced a rapid structural transformation and strong economic growth in recent decades. It has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world amid the current global economic slowdown. With a demographic dividend ushering in tremendous economic gains, a huge domestic market, and substantial opportunities for integration with the global economy, India has the potential to move to a higher growth trajectory. To sustain this momentum, it must continue to create economic opportunities for its large labor force, which is increasing by about 12 million a year. One pressing policy challenge is to create more productive and well-paying jobs in the manufacturing sector, which contributes about 17% to gross domestic product (GDP) versus 21-29% in East and Southeast Asia. India also has limited participation in GVCs with a GVC Participation Index of 43% in 2011, lower than its peers in Asia including Republic of Korea (62%), Malaysia (60%), and People’s Republic of China (48%). To continue on a sustainable growth path, India would require greater investment in infrastructure, regulatory reforms, skills development and technological modernization, and innovation in financing. The underlying objective should be to enable the private sector, which has been the backbone of India’s capital formation and employment generation, to fulfill its growth potential.  The economic corridor development strategy  Economic corridor development (ECD) is an approach that integrates and synergizes industry, infrastructure, logistics, and urbanization through industrial production clusters linked to urban centers and international gateways by an efficient multimodal transport network. A successful ECD strategy requires quality infrastructure and a policy framework that contributes to an efficient industrial base, attracts investment in the manufacturing sector, and facilitates production for domestic and export markets. Urban centers within a corridor are not only major markets for manufactured and imported goods, but also sources of labor, technology, knowledge, and innovation. GoI is currently building a host of industrial corridors across the country. Alongside ECEC, four more industrial corridor projects (Delhi-Mumbai, Chennai-Bengaluru, Bengaluru-Mumbai, and Amritsar Kolkata) have been identified, planned and launched by the GoI. These corridors are spread across India, with strategic focus on inclusive development to provide an impetus to industrialization and planned urbanization.  Key dimensions of ECEC  = Port-led industrialization = Ports are the cornerstone of international trade and world economic growth, with maritime transport now accounting for nearly 85% of global demand. ECEC’s long coastline and strategic location provide an opportunity to develop multiple international gateways to connect India with global value chains. 436x436px ECEC will buttress the government’s Sagarmala initiative, which seeks to develop India’s economic strength along its coastline by transforming ports, industrial clusters near the coast, and inland logistics infrastructure. ECEC, with its large network of ports and burgeoning maritime industry, is poised to play an important role in developing the maritime hubs. = Infrastructure network = Improvements to essential and efficient infrastructure will reduce transaction costs for businesses, thus spurring increased private investment, industrial progress, and economic growth. Connecting industries to GVCs centered in East and Southeast Asia requires world-class infrastructure, logistics, and distribution facilities. Upgrading road and rail networks and developing cross-connecting lateral links will stimulate economic activity in existing and emerging clusters and enhance logistics competitiveness in ECEC. It will also provide time- and cost-efficient linkages between the hinterlands and ECEC, as well as secure reliable power supplies for industries by increasing power generation capacities and strengthening the transmission network. = Regulatory framework = Successful industrialization requires a vibrant economic landscape in which private businesses can thrive. Within ECEC, it is necessary to create a regulatory environment that will improve ease of doing business that makes it straightforward to start a new business, and for existing businesses to grow, innovate, create much-needed jobs, and even close. Institutional changes at the central, state, and district levels can build upon a foundation of past policy reform achievements. = Industrialization and urbanization = A relatively robust industrial environment in key areas enables the corridor to integrate more effectively with similar regions in the country. Priority industries for ECEC are largely port based or port led, signifying the importance of ports and connectivity infrastructure. Moreover, the industries in ECEC align well with containerized commodities currently shipped through West coast ports. A successful ECD strategy should synchronize industrial development and urbanization by providing adequate physical and social infrastructure in urban centers to meet workers’ quality-of-life needs. Model developments such as Sri City in Andhra Pradesh and the Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat offer a way forward in reconciling urbanization and industrial development. = Regional integration = Most Asian economies, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, have grown by trading with their neighbors. In contrast, South Asia is one of the least economically integrated regions in the world and South Asian economies lag their Asian peers with respect to trade. The various economic corridors being developed across South Asia are expected to facilitate trade by expanding land and maritime routes and stepping up regional integration efforts. ECEC will be interconnected with other corridors and evolve into a regional corridor by connecting existing and new industries with GVCs through ports; efficient multimodal and intermodal transportation networks; logistics and distribution facilities. As a spine corridor and, ECEC will serve as a backbone for regional cooperation projects that enhance exchange within South Asia and between India and East/Southeast Asia.  Component corridors of ECEC  ECEC covers four Indian states. It is home to 20% of India’s population and contributes about $533 billion in 2016-2017 (about 22%) to the country's GDP. The corridor region hosts 7 out of 12 of India’s major ports, namely: Chennai, Ennore, Haldia, Kolkata, Paradip, Tuticorin, and Visakhapatnam. Due to its vast scope, ECEC's development is being undertaken in phases: phase 1 covers the Visakhapatnam–Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC), largely in Andhra Pradesh; phase 2 involves the Chennai–Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC) in Tamil Nadu; and phase 3 supports the Odisha Economic Corridor (OEC) and the West Bengal Economic Corridor (WBEC). GOI has selected the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as the lead partner for developing the ECEC. The conceptualization and development of ECEC has received major support from ADB, which carried out analytical work determining the kind of infrastructure and institutional investments necessary to drive manufacturing-led growth in consultation with the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, GOI. =Visakhapatnam–Chennai Industrial Corridor= At the heart of VCIC is a transport corridor that extends north–south over 800 km along National Highway 16 (NH 16) on the coast of Andhra Pradesh connecting clusters where industries are located. VCIC traverses through nine districts with proximity to urban centers of Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, and Chennai. The corridor region accounts for more than 75% of the state's output and 4.3% of India's GDP. It is a key region for food production (especially marine products and rice), chemicals and petrochemical products. It is also becoming gateway for textile movement. VCIC is designed to support the Sunrise Andhra Pradesh Vision 2029. When fully implemented, VCIC is expected to increase GDP in corridor districts by 6 times, increase manufacturing share from 9.4% in 2017 to more than 20% in 2045, and create 9.5 million jobs by 2045 . Four economic nodes were identified for priority development at the conceptual planning stage, namely: Visakhapatnam, Machilipatnam, Donakonda, and Srikalahasti-Yerpedu. In close collaboration with the Andhra Pradesh government, master planning was completed for two priority nodes: Visakhapatnam (7,082 acres) and Srikalahasti-Yerpedu (Chittoor) (26,425 acres). =Chennai–Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor = CKIC, the second phase of ECEC, aims to unlock the potential to accelerate manufacturing growth in the state of Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu already ranks high in India in terms of economic prowess, and is one of the most competitive across several key indicators. CKIC’s influence area covers 23 of the 32 districts of Tamil Nadu, which accounts for 74% of the state’s population and 67% of its output. The region has a developed industrial ecosystem in key sectors such as automobiles and textiles. It has 3 major ports and 2 minor ports with combined cargo of 240 million tonnes per year. CKIC and its infrastructure plan will be aligned with Vision 2023 of the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Sagarmala initiative with initial focus on the southern region. Findings from the initial study identified six nodes for development, namely: Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) at Cuddalore and Nagapattinam; Ariyalur and Perambalur; Trichy- Pudukottai-Sivaganga; Madurai-Virudhunagar-Dindigul-Theni (MVDT); Ramanathapuram; and Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli (TT). With guidance from the Government of Tamil Nadu, the master planning for MVDT and TT nodes is underway. = Odisha Economic Corridor = The Odisha Economic Corridor is part of the third phase of ECEC. The corridor influence area accounts for 20 districts contributing about 80% of Odisha’s output. Odisha is mineral-rich and contributes to India steel production more than any state. With proximity to northern Indian states, it can play a crucial role to transportation of various goods. Six nodes have been short-listed for the corridor at the conceptual planning stage, namely: Khordha–Cuttack–Jagatsinghpur (KCJ), Jajpur–Kendrapara–Bhadrak (JKB), Sambalpur–Sundargarh–Jharsuguda (SSJ), Mayurbhanj–Keonjhar–Balasore (MKB), Angul–Dhenkanal (AD), and Ganjam. In consultation with the Government of Odisha, factors such as land availability and distances from large cities, highways, and ports have been used to prioritize the two nodes of KCJ and JKB. These nodes have the key urban areas of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. = West Bengal Economic Corridor = West Bengal has the fourth largest economy in India with $155 billion in state output in 2017-2018. It is the 6th biggest contributor to India's manufacturing, and 4th biggest in India's services, which provides nearly 40 million jobs. It contributes more than 20 percent of the country’s mineral production, and accounts for 10% of the country's iron and steel exports. It is India's leading state in terms of power distribution, quality and availability. It is strategically located as a gateway to northeast India and southeast Asia, being served by key national highways and Asian highways; two large container and bulk handling ports at Kolkata and Haldia; two international airports, and several inland waterways. Conceptual development planning for WBEC is underway. Proposed spine is that along NH 16 from Sonakania to Kolkata, and along NH 112 from Kolkata to Bongaon (Bangladesh border), with another fork linked to the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor through NH 60. Key industrial nodes being considered based on land availability include Goaltore (Paschim Medinipur) and Andal (Burdwan) located in Aerotropolis. The key industries identified for these potential node (Goaltore) based on initial assessment include fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment, and transport equipment. Potential for sub-sectors in food processing and cement are also being evaluated.  Asian Development Bank support for ECEC  = Analytical studies = Analytical work is done in two phases: the conceptual development plan (CDP) followed by master planning. With ADB assistance, CDP for the first 3 sub-corridors of ECEC have already been completed. The CDP assessed each corridor for market strengths and potential linkages with GVCs; and identified industrial nodes, assess future growth industries, and map out critical infrastructure needs. It also recommended policy and regulatory reforms to create a business-friendly environment. Master planning is completed for VCIC, and is in progress for CKIC. The master plan guides government agencies in initiating the development of the corridor region. It focuses on identifying industries suitable to each priority node and industrial site, assessing land demand, mapping out required connectivity and trunk infrastructure and amenities, and identifying early bird projects. It also intends to put forward a social impact assessment and resettlement action plan for the economic nodes. = Financial mobilization = ADB has supported the corridor’s conceptualization and development and carried out analytical work in consultation with the DIPP, GoI to determine the infrastructure and institutional investments needed to drive manufacturing-led growth. ADB approved on September 20, 2016 (i) a $500 million multi-tranche financing facility (MFF), and (ii) a $125 million policy-based loan (PBL), both to India for the Visakhapatnam–Chennai Industrial Corridor Development Program (VCICDP). The MFF will support priority infrastructure investments in the VCIC, and the PBL will support policy reforms and institutional development in the state. For CKIC and Odisha, ADB is in consultation with the state governments in supporting several priority infrastructure investments in the transport, urban, and power sectors. Subject to the confirmation of the Government of India, ADB is planning to provide $1 billion per year in 2018-2022 to help develop ECEC. = Policy and Advisory Support = ADB has been supporting Andhra Pradesh in improving its ease of doing business and creating a business-friendly regulatory environment. In July 2018, Andhra Pradesh, with a score of 98.42 per cent, topped the ease of doing business ranking among Indian states prepared by the World Bank and DIPP. In the prior year, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had jointly topped the same rankings. Parameters for the rankings include construction permit, labor regulation, environmental registration, access to information, land availability, and single window system. DIPP collaborates with the World Bank in conducting an annual reform exercise for all states and union territories under the Business Reform Action Plan. = Investment Promotion = ADB has also been assisting GoI and state governments in attracting new investment into ECEC—drawing in key anchor investors into the corridor, and encouraging expansion of existing businesses. Reaching out to the business community aims to tailor the direction of infrastructure investment and policy reforms in ECEC in accordance with the most urgent needs of existing and potential investors. ADB has supported activities that highlight investment opportunities in ECEC including road shows, business summits, government-to-business conference, and business-to-business meetings.

Set in contemporary Louisiana, it tells the story of Charley Bordelon, a young African-American widow from Los Angeles, California, who moves to a rural town to manage a sugarcane farm she had unexpectedly inherited there from her father. Plot Charley Bordelon is a young mother in Los Angeles, California, who has recently been widowed. After the death of her father, she learns that rather than inheriting his local rental properties, she has inherited a sugarcane farm in St. Joseph, Louisiana, where he was born and raised. Against her mother's wishes, Charley moves to St. Joseph, taking her 11-year-old daughter, Micah, with her and moving in with her paternal grandmother, Miss Honey. Shortly after arriving, Charley learns that her property manager has been neglecting the farm and is about to quit to work an oil rig. She is hard pressed to find another property manager so late in the season but Prosper Denton, a retired farmer recommended by Miss Honey, reluctantly agrees to come out of retirement to help her. Charley's estranged older half-brother Ralph Angel, a former drug addict and the child of their father's relationship with his high school sweetheart in St. Joseph, returns to town with his son, Blue. Angel is deeply embittered that his father left him nothing, and he also resents Charley for having been raised by a man who essentially abandoned him. Charley struggles to keep the farm going, quickly realizing that it takes more money than was earmarked for maintenance. She believes that wealthy white farmers in the area, such as Jacques Landry and Samuel T. Baron, are conspiring against her and ready to take over the land if she fails. She learns from Miss Honey that her father once worked as a cane cutter on the farm she now owns. In the days of segregation and Jim Crow, he was beaten by an overseer for drinking from a water pail first instead of giving way to the white workers. She renews her determination to keep the farm running, as a way of continuing her father's struggle. She and Denton hire a retired white farmer, Alison Delcambre, to help manage the farm. They recover from a hurricane that flattens the crops. Charley refuses to hire Angel. He finds low-paying menial labor in the rural community and slides back to drug abuse. Charley meets a white farmer, Remy Newell, a divorcé who seems attracted to her. Their courtship is short lived after Remy makes insensitive racial comments. But after some encouragement from her aunt Violet, Charley decides to give Remy another chance. He asks his goddaughter, elected as Queen Sugar for the annual festival, to invite her daughter Micah to be an honorary member of her court and ride on the parade float with her, and the young girl is thrilled. Miss Honey forces Charley to give Angel a job. He is resentful of the menial assignment and later tells Charley she should be ashamed of dating a white man. Charley fires him. To get revenge Angel steals the money Miss Honey keeps in her house and a statue. Charley's father had given her The Cane Cutter, and she planned to sell it at auction to raise money to complete the cane harvest. On Micah's birthday, Charley discovers The Cane Cutter is gone, and believes that she faces financial ruin. The rest of the family immediately thinks that Angel stole the statue but Miss Honey denies it; nonetheless, she refuses to let anyone call the police. A few days later Angel returns and confesses he stole the piece. During an altercation with his cousin, John, a correctional officer, Angel shoots and wound him. He is soon caught by police who, seeing his gun, fatally shoot him. Charley is devastated by the loss of the artwork and the death of her brother. Preparing to meet with Landy and Baron to accept their offer for her farm, she happens to tell Hollywood, a former friend of Angel, her predicament. He offers to give her the $50,000 she needs to complete harvesting. He has saved a small fortune through mowing lawns for $5 an hour. Charley completes the harvest and prepares for the following season. She and Remy continue their relationship, and she starts the process of adopting her nephew Blue. She learns that Angel never sold The Cane Cutter, and kept it in his trunk. After the statue is returned to Charley, she promises it to Blue when he grows up. Reception Adaptation In 2014, the Oprah television network OWN negotiated a deal for the rights to adapt the book as a television series. It was created, directed, and executive produced by Ava DuVernay. Oprah Winfrey served as an executive producer. The series airs on Oprah Winfrey Network and premiered on September 6, 2016. It was still running in 2019. Biography Baszile attended local schools. She initially studied finance and economics in college, as her father wanted her to go into his family business. She felt she most came alive in her English classes. She started working with her father in his business after college, but also continued her writing. Baszile eventually changed fields and graduated from UCLA with a M.A. in Afro-American Studies and a MFA in Writing from Warren Wilson College. She started writing what became Queen Sugar in the 1990s, exploring an African-American-themed tale of endurance and hope in the American South. She worked on the text for ten years. She sent her manuscript to publishers in 2009 but without any success. After revising the book for two years, she resubmitted the text, and one agent agreed to represent her. Baszile attended a women writer's retreat in Hedgebrook. Her friend and novelist Sarah Manyika, who also attended, suggested that Baszile read part of a chapter from Queen Sugar to the group. Attendee Leigh Haber, book editor for O, The Oprah Magazine, loved the novel and passed it to people at Harpo for their review. A few months after that, Harpo called Baszile to say they wanted to option the book for a project.Misan Sagay, \\"Natalie Baszile wrote the book she wanted to read: Queen Sugar\\", LiteraryHub.com References 2014 American novels African-American novels Literature by African-American women Novels adapted into television shows Novels set in Louisiana Burn survivors in fiction 2014 debut novels ","title":"Queen Sugar (novel)"},{"id":"52491327","text":"Regiment Molopo was an armoured regiment of the South African Army.

It is located in the parish of Preunschen in the municipality of Kirchzell, in the Lower Franconian district of Miltenberg in Bavaria.  Location  The ruins of the hill castle lie on a northeast-projecting hill spur, the Schlossberg, at a height of above the valley of the Mud, three kilometres southeast of Kirchzell and only a few hundred metres northeast of the centre of Preunschen, about 13 kilometres southwest of the district town of Miltenberg.  History  Inscription naming the lords who had the castle built Photo collage of views, window arches and ornaments The variety of mason's marks The lords of Dürn, meritorious members of the retinue of the Hohenstaufen emperor and Schutzvögte of Amorbach Abbey, had the castle built sometime between 1180 and around 1200. According to the Amorbach Abbey chronicles, however, his grandson Conrad I of Dürn (died 1258) started construction in 1216. This probably just refers, however, to the construction of the gate tower. In 1271 and 1272 parts of the castle were sold, due to the Dürn's financial difficulties to the Archbishopric of Mainz and later to the Amt of the Mainz government, after the Barony of Walldürn had been purchased in its entirety in 1292 by Mainz. Its management was initially exercised by officiates (Offiziate), but later by a vogt or burgrave. In 1291, a certain Henry was the officiate, around 1320 it was Conrad Rüdt of Collenberg. In 1337 Archbishop Henry reconciled with his cathedral chapter and signed over Wildenberg Castle to the canons for a short period. In 1350 the Amt of the castle was enfeoffed to Eberhard of Rosenberg. In 1354 Conrad Rüdt of Collenberg redeemed the fief. By increasing his borrowings from the Archbishop of Mainz, Conrad also received the offices of Walldürn and Buchen. In 1356 an earthquake is said to have seriously damaged the castle. In January that year Archbishop Gerlach enfeoffed the castle of Wildenburg, the town Amorbach and a free tenancy in Miltenberg, without the consent of his cathedral chapter, to Engelhard of Hirschhorn. One year later, he lent money to his Wildeburg burgrave, Conrad Rüdt of Collenberg.Fritz Vigener (revisor.): Regesten der Erzbischöfe von Mainz von 1289-1396. / Zweite Abteilung (1354-1396), First Volume 1354-1371. Reprint of the 1913 Leipzig edition, Berlin, 1970. registers 500 & 910. From 1368 Wiprecht of Dürn, Eberhardt Rüdt of Bödigheim, Fritz of Dürn and Eberhard of Fechenbach were the Mainz castellans. In the later period up to the 15th century, members of these families were mentioned as Amtmänner. In the years 1400 to 1511 the castle was extended in a late medieval style. The west tower and barrier wall through the castle courtyard were built, and the castle chapel renovated. Until 1525, the castle was still the headquarters of a Mainz Amtmann for the Amt Amorbach. In the German Peasants' War, peasants from the Heller Haufen led by the knight Götz of Berlichingen razed Wildenberg Castle on 4 May 1525. Since then, it has been a ruin. In 1803, as part of the process of secularization, the castle was seized by the Principality of Leiningen for a short time. In 1806, the Principality of Leiningen was mediatised by the Grand Duchy of Baden. By 1810 the castle and the area around Amorbach became part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt and, in 1816, was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria in an exchange of territory. Parts of the castle were used in the 19th century to build the artificial ruins of Eulbach Park. Today, the castle ruins are a popular hiking destination and occasionally used for cultural events.  Description  In essence, the approximately rectangular, 80-metre-long, Hohenstaufen period inner ward has survived, having been little altered over the centuries. A diagonally oriented bergfried stands on the uphill side. On the south side is a gate tower with a stepped portal and a castle chapel with bay window on the upper storey of the apse. The spacious palas is situated on the downhill side of the castle. Its window arches on the upper floor, which are comparable to those of the imperial palace of Gelnhausen and Château de Guirbaden in Alsace, are of high artistic value. The partition wall in the middle of the courtyard is a post-Hohenstaufen addition. That apart, there have been hardly any structural changes to the castle over the years, which is why Wildenberg, despite its ruinous state, is regarded as one of the best preserved Hohenstaufen castles in Southern Germany. The castle is rich in various mason's marks (at least 50 different ones have been found), some of which are also found on other castles of the Rhine-Main-Neckar region, e.g. Stolzeneck Castle on the River Neckar and also in the palace at Gelnhausen. The castle is situated at the beginning of the spur ridge south-west of Preunschen. A few metres above the castle is the Fels(en)burg (\\"Rock Castle\\"), a cave hewn out of a natural, rock formation,See Preunchen: The Felsburg above Wildenberg Castle at www.panoramio.com with a rectangular stone entrance portal. The rock was hewn and the stone slabs so arranged to form a flat platform above.See Preunschen: The Felsburg - Cave Entrance I and 33929079 Preunschen: The Felsburg - Cave Entrance II at www.panoramio.com It may be conjectured that this was designed as a sort of outer ward to protect the spur side, but that has not been proven. File:Burg Wildenberg 01.jpgThe northern flank of the castle File:Wildenburg2.JPGThe bergfried  Parzival  Wildenberg Castle is possibly the castle that is called Montsalvaesch in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, and depending on its linguistic origin is interpreted as Heilsberg (\\"Salvation Hill\\" or \\"Holy Hill\\") or wilder Berg (\\"Wild Hill\\") (c.f. section 230, verse 13). In the fifth book (Die Gralsburg) the Wildenberg is specifically mentioned: \\"Who saw such a great fire/Here by us in Wildenberg?\\" It is possible therefore that Wolfram von Eschenbach wrote part of the novel here.Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parzival, Auswahl, Reprint, 5th book However, other castles may also have been suggested as the subject. Wolfram von Eschenbach may have written his description of the holy hill just based on contemporary paradise literature.Günther Ebersold: Wildenberg und Munsalvaesche, Peter Lang Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, Berne, New York, Paris, 1988, . 139 pages; Index here File:Burg Wildenberg Fenster 1.jpgPalas and window arcades (Fensterarkaden) File:Burg Wildenberg 1.jpgLate medieval dividing wall File:Burg Wildenberg Kamin 1.jpgRenovated fireplace of the palas  Literature  * Alexander Antonow: Burgen im Main-Viereck.

Planned as the western wing of the old school, the building was estimated to cost £5,000. It has of frontage along South Terrace and was made from brick with a local limestone base. It features a Donnybrook plinth and facings, and a roof of Marseilles tiling. Designed to have ten new classrooms each to hold 30 students it provided access to the first floor via a wide stairway opening onto a large landing. Each floor had five classroom with the rooms on the ground floor surrounding a large open hall space.

Ranjith later confirmed the news and said the title was not confirmed. In November, the title was revealed as Puthan Panam, with its subject reported to be of black money and a cast including Iniya, Renji Panicker, Sai Kumar and Siddique. A tagline, 'The New Indian Rupee', is suffixed to the title, coinciding with the situation when the ₹1000 and ₹500 banknotes were demonetised in India by the Central Government. Filming began on 25 November 2016. Filming took place in Cochin, Calicut, Goa and Pollachi. Mammootty plays Nithyananda Shenoy, a middle-aged man who hails from Kumbala and speaks Kasargode dialect. Mammootty was trained in Kasargode accent with the guidance of dialogue writer P. V. Shajikumar. Ranjith called Shajikumar for writing dialogues in Puthan Panam as per the suggestion of Mammootty. Mammootty found Kumar on a Whatsapp group named 'Njatuvela' where both were members. When Shajikumar translated a poem, \\"Apolitical Intellectuals\\" by Otto René Castillo, in Kasargode dialect and posted on the group, Mammootty was impressed. Shooting lasted three months. Swaraj Gramika, a child artiste from a Thiruvananthapuram-based theatre group, who played a prominent role in the film, was selected after a casual meet with Ranjith in Kozhikode, whom he had earlier sent the details of his two short films and theatre productions. Shaan Rahman composed the soundtrack. Reception =Critical= Deepa Soman of The Times of India rated the film three out five and concluded, \\"If you go expecting to watch a wholesome film on the black money issue, you might not get your money's worth from this flick. But if all that you care about is to stay entertained through the length of the film, it is worth your ‘Puthan Panam’\\". Though appreciating Mammootty's characterisation saying, \\"You feel sorry for Mammootty, who plays his character with total dedication. He looks convincing and is his makeover is just brilliant,\\" Moviebuzz of Sify stated, \\"Puthan Panam is lazily done and besides some casual references here and there, the connection with the demonetization drive is barely impressive. In short, after a good start, this one goes awry.

It is one of the ten entities that make up the Safran Group.  History  The Société d’applications générales d’électricité et de mécanique (SAGEM) was created in 1925. The company's products ranged from inertial navigation systems to fax machines. SAGEM also manufactured precision equipment for the French Navy: gyrocompasses, fire-control units, optronic equipment.SAGEM, ROQUES MICHEL, Sagem, soixante ans à tire-d'aile, SAGEM, 1986, 140 p. In 2005, SAGEM merged with the French company \\"Société nationale d'étude et de construction de moteurs d'aviation (SNECMA)\\" to form the Safran Group. Within this framework, SAGEM's activities merged with the company Sagem Défense Sécurité. In 2007, the security applications were separated off and a new company named Sagem Sécurité was created (now called Morpho). The Safran Electronics division was created in 2009, grouping together all Safran's electronic engineers. In 2011, the facility in Tarbes (south-west France), which manufactured components for the Magajoule Laser, was sold to the Alcen Group. The question of whether to merge or exchange activities with the Thales Group was regularly raised between 2004 and 2011. On 1 January 2012, the facility in Fougères (France), formerly Sagem Industries, merged with Sagem Défense Sécurité. In the same year, Thales and Sagem acquired Areva's stake in Sofradir. Sagem owns 50% of this subsidiary which is a European leader in infra-red detectors. In July, the two companies announced the creation of OPTROLEAD, a 50/50 joint-venture company working in the field of optronics. In January 2013, the facility in Saint-Pierre-du- Perray (France) became a fully owned subsidiary of Safran Electronics & Defense. The company focuses on designing and manufacturing high-performance optics for space, astronomy, high-power lasers and the semiconductor industry. In 2013, Sagem announced the opening of a factory in Casablanca (Morocco) to produce components for actuators and avionics equipment. On 19 May 2016, all the Group's companies took the name of Safran, and Sagem became Safran Electronics & Defense. At the end of that year, the company grouped together all its R&D; and R&T; activities in the north-west of Paris on the Éragny site. The company has been headed up by the following directors (in chronological order): Jacques Paccard, Jean-Paul Herteman (appointed in November 2006), Jean-Lin Fournereaux (September 2007), Philippe Petitcolin (June 2011), Bruno Even (May 2013) and Martin Sion (June 2015).  Organization  The company has three divisions: Avionics, Optronics & Defense and Safran Electronics. Today, it has nine facilities in France and twelve subsidiaries spread across four continents.  Activity  Safran Electronics & Defense is a technology company that develops civil and military solutions for sea, land, air and space applications. For example, in the field of optronics, the company developed the non-penetrating periscope for the Barracuda submarine, the FELIN system (an integrated infantry soldier combat suite), infrared scope and cameras for helicopters and tanks, as well as the Sperwer and Patroller drone systems. In terms of avionics, the company provides numerous types of equipment, ranging from the electric flight control system for the NH90 helicopter to the information system for the Airbus A380, as well as inertial navigation systems and engine control systems. Finally, in the space sector, Safran manufactures high-performance space optics used on satellites such as MeteoSat and Gaia.

The film stars Tovino Thomas, Wamiqa Gabbi, Aju Varghese and Renji Panicker. Godha was released on 19 May 2017. The plot is about amateur wrestling. Plot In Punjab, Aditi Singh (Wamiqa Gabbi) is a Punjab University wrestling champion. Her late father had encouraged her to take up wrestling from a young age but her older brother restricts her, sometimes through violent means. In a small village in Kerala, wrestling used to be a passion for the old generations but the younger generation has moved on to cricket. They frequently clash over Manayathuvayal, a large field where wrestling competitions used to happen years earlier. Aanjaneya Das (Tovino Thomas) is one of the youth of the village that play cricket and is generally aimless in life. Captain (Renji Panicker), who used to be the wrestling champion of the village and his father, sends him to Punjab University against his wishes to enroll him in Master's. There he meets and befriends Aditi and he falls in love with her. However, her brother fixes her marriage against her wishes and while he takes her home by force, Das interferes and assaults her brother who is a Punjab police officer. Upon Aditi's insistence, he returns to Kerala temporarily until things cool off. But a few days later, he gets a call from Aditi informing him that she ran away to escape from marriage and has landed in his village. Das lodges her in his home without his parents' knowledge but news soon spreads to his family and later, the village. They reluctantly let her stay there while Das' friends try to woo her. During a temple festival, Aditi takes down two drunkards who misbehave with her. Impressed by her wrestling moves, Captain decides to train her at his gym while Das' friends leave cricket and take up wrestling to get closer to her which irritates Das. During training, Captain pushes her to work hard and enroll in national wrestling championships while Aditi's mingling and friendship with Das' friends enrages him. One night, he scolds Aditi for her behavior while she reminds him that he has no right to control her actions. Hurt, he proposes her but they are overheard by Captain. Captain tells Das that she aims to become a wrestling champion and encourages him to find his own aim in order to become her equal. A flashback shows that Das was a junior wrestling champion under his father's tutelage but he quit due to his strict and tough training which soured their relationship ever since. Das realizes that his aim and desire was always to be a wrestling champion and vows to be one, no matter what hardships he faces. He joins his dad's gym while Aditi trains to represent Kerala in National Games. During National Games, the officials inform them that Aditi is ineligible as she is from Punjab. Hurt, she sees her nemesis, Pinto, winning gold. After the match, they exchange heated words and Aditi challenges her to a wrestling competition in Manayathuvayal which she accepts. The entire village prepares for the competition and the young generation takes initiative in preparing Manayathuvayal for the same. Aditi's brother tracks her to the village and reaches the venue as the competition starts. After fighting hard, Aditi wins the competition earning her brother's approval and inspiring Das while the entire village celebrates her victory. It is revealed that Das is now into wrestling competitions.

It came into being during the second half of the 10th century, covering an area from the eastern border of the Carolingian Carantanian ' of (that is, the Drava valley between the mouth of the Vellach and Schwabegg) to Pettau (modern Ptuj) in the territory of Friedau (Ormož). After 1147 it was attached to the ' forming the March of Styria/Carantania, which later gave rise to the Duchy of Styria. Other designations for the territory include ' ('March of Pettau'), ' ('March beyond the Drava forest'), ' ('County beyond the Drava forest'), ', ', and ' ('lower Carantanian March').  Geography  The territory of the march corresponded to that of the Gau of Zistanesfeld, which straddled the river ' (Drava), south of where the Mur approaches it. The Carinthian County of Jaun (also Jaune, Jaunetal) probably had its eastern border check-point in Hohenmauthen (Muta), beyond which, down the Drava, began the dense Drava forest, which only thinned out again when it reached Marburg (modern Maribor, which first appeared after 1147). In Feistritz (Bistrica pri Rušah, approx. 10 km west of Maribor and which as of 1992 forms part of Bistrica ob Dravi) lay an internal border customs point which is attested from 1093, where it is named as a customs point of the \\"March of Pettau\\", an alternative name for the march which is derived from its central settlement Pettau (modern Ptuj). The course of the ' () ditches were accepted as the border within the Drava forest itself. The territories west of this line – Mahrenberg (Radlje ob Dravi), Hohenmauthen (Muta), Saldenhofen (Vuzenica) and Windischgraz (Slovenj Gradec) – still belonged in the narrow sense to the Duchy of Carinthia (from 976). In the north the march extended as far as the crest of the Kozjak Mountains, in the east to the river Mur and in the south to the Sann-Drann-watershed. The eastern border with the Kingdom of Hungary was poorly defined; the lordship of Ankenstein (Borl) was an autonomous territory (Allod) until the reign of Maximilian I; Polstrau (Središče ob Dravi) on the other hand was a Hungarian fief of the Archbishopric of Salzburg until 1803. (Ebner)  History  = Formation = Following the German victory at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 the Hungarian threat was lifted for the time being, and in the subsequent years (970–980) the Holy Roman Empire was secured through the establishment of a wide belt of border marches against south-eastern threats. These included the March of Austria (contemporarily ' in Latin or ' in Old High German), the ' (the Carantanian march, later the March of Styria), the ''''', the ' (which at that time extended far to the south over the Sava river and encompassed the Windic March), and the Marches of Carniola and Istria. The marches of Verona and Friuli had already been integrated into what would become the northern half of the empire by 952. A count (') named Rachwin was mentioned in 980, in whose ' (county) a man named WillihalmWilhelm III., Graf in Karantanien bei „Genealogie Mittelalter“ (father of the later Margrave Wilhelm von der Sann) was granted the later lordship of Weitenstein (Vitanje) by Kaiser Otto II. In 985 due to the intervention of Duke Henry of Carinthia, Otto III gave count Rachwin 15 ' (a unit of land equivalent to the Scottish and English Oxgang) in Rosswein (Razvanje, south of Maribor).Heinrich III. der Jüngere, Herzog von Bayern (1) und (2) bei „Genealogie Mittelalter“ This is probably the same count Rachwin who was named in 980. Until about 1005 the territory of Aribo, ' (Margrave in the Jaun valley) was administeredAribo, Markgraf im Jaunetal bei „Genealogie Mittelalter“ by a brother of bishop Albuin of Brixen and member of the Aribonids, and who held large amounts of lucrative property in Bavaria, Salzburg, Carinthia and Styria (namely around Leoben and Straßgang), as well as in the Drava and Sann (Savinja) marches. = Church Organisation = In the 12th century several parishes in the area around the Patriarchate of Aquileia (south of the Drava, mostly in modern northern Italy) and the Archbishopric of Salzburg (north of the Drava) – \\"mother parishes\\" with vicariates and proprietary churches of the nobles – were condensed into Archdeaconates in accordance with Charlemagne's planned 811 division of ecclesiastical territory: :North of the Drava up to Kozjak Mountains, i.e. the area of the Archdiocese of Salzburg, the parishes were assigned to the \\"Archdeacon of the lower march\\". The Mahrenberg district alone belonged to the Archdeaconate of Lower Carinthia (and so to Salzburg). Here the boundaries are those of the old political borders between the march and the duchy. :South of the Drava, extending as far as the Sava, was the Archdeaconate of Sanntal (i.e. the Sann valley), which also included Ratschach (Radeče) and Schärfenberg (Svibno) beyond the river. However, the parishes of the Windic March and the Aquileian Saldenhofen district were subordinated to the Archdeaconate of Carinthia. This also covered its eastern border with the political border between the march and the duchy of Carinthia. (Ebner) = Sponheims = In 1122 the Spanheim Duke Henry IV of Carinthia transferred the comital title in the ' ('March beyond the Drava forest') to his brother Bernhard. At the same time its ' was expanded up to Unterdrauburg (Dravograd). = Traungauer (Otakars) = Count Bernhard was married to Kundigunde, daughter of the Styrian Margrave Ottokar II and, upon Bernhard's death in 1147 during the Second Crusade in Laodicia in Asia Minor, all of his allods and ministeriales, as well as the Margravial feudal Amt, fell to Ottokar III of Styria, Ottokar II's son and Kundigunde's brother. This included the lordships of Marburg, Lembach (Limbuš) and Radkersburg, and the ministriales of Marburgm Lembach Haidin and Dranneck or Treun, as well as the Vogtei over the Salzburger lordship of Pettau. With that ended the march's political dependence on Carinthia. (Ebner) In 1164 Ottokar III founded the Kartause Seiz from his Spanheim inheritance.

In 1254 the Styrian Drava territory, along with large parts of the rest of Styria, fell to Hungary in the peace of Ofen. However, King Ottokar II of Bohemia subsequently annexed the territory, along with the rest of Styria, following his victory in the battle of Kressenbrunn in 1260. In the battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, in which Ottokar was defeated by Rudolf I of Germany, Ottokar was killed by a Mahrenberger. (Seifried von Mahrenberg, a prominent Styrian noble, had been tortured and killed some years before Ottokar for an invalid claim.) (Reichel) = Habsburgs = In 1336 the ' was still mentioned. In 1362 the territory of Windischgraz (Slovenj Gradec), which had been a possession of the Patriarchate of Aquileia since 1228 (and before that the Counts of Andechs; see Henry II, Margrave of Istria), fell to the Habsburgs, but belonged neither to Styria nor Carinthia. In 1407 it was de facto part of Styria, although it was not de jure Styrian until 1482.

It was written by Brisbane author, Chris Gardner, who also wrote The House of Mancello (1962) and A Private Island (1964). Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. The play concerned an interracial romance which led Filmink magazine to think it was \\"an indication that Australian television was willing to confront some of the nation’s trickier social issues head on.\\" Other Australian TV plays to deal with racial issues included Burst of Summer. It was aired on ABC and ran for an hour on Wednesday 27 April 1960 at 8.30pm. It was produced in Melbourne. Plot In the town of Nombora, a university-educated half- aboriginal man, Jim Robertson, falls for a white woman, his childhood playmate, Julie Handford. Social and family problems begin when they decide to get married. The play is set at a homestead near a Queensland banana plantation. Beryl Parker is a scheming friend who causes trouble. Julie winds up rejecting Jim. Cast Edward Brayshaw, Elizabeth Goodman 17 March 1960 The Age *Edward Brayshaw as Jim Robertson *Elizabeth Goodman as Julie Handford *Moira Carleton as Grannie Hill *James Lynch as Les Holland *Berys Marsh as Beryl Parker *John Norman as Dave Handford *Joyce Turner as Mr Handford Production Early Australian TV drama production was dominated by using imported scripts but in 1960 the ABC was undertaking what has been described as \\"an Australiana drive\\" of producing local stories. In January 1960 the ABC announced the play would be one of several new TV plays from Australian writers. The others included Eye of the Night, The Turning Point and The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day. The play was written by Christ Gardner, a Queensland author. She had moved from England to Australia eight years previously was living in Woody Point. She started writing when briefly bed- ridden due to a slipped disc then became more serious about it when she joined a Brisbane radio group in 1956. Dark Under the Sun was her first TV play. Director William Sterling said the play was written in the style of Paddy Chayevsky or Ted Willis - \\"a familiar social situation being shown in a simple, believable story with recognisable characters appearing in realistic situations and arguing their point of view forcefully without being mere mouthpieces for a particular opinion.\\" Advertising called it \\"a dramatic live play by Chris Gardner on the problem of social assimilation in a Queensland community.\\" Reception Edward Brayshaw, Elizaveth Goodman The Age 1 Apr 1960 The Age TV reviewer called it \\"excellent... struck such a telling blow for Australian produced and written drama that it is regrettable that not more than a handful of viewers watched this one hour production.\\" He added Brayshaw \\"at times his acting was quite brilliant\\" and thought Goodman \\"also performed excellently... the drama flowed smoothly and well.\\" The same paper, when it reviewed the year in Australian television, again called the production \\"outstanding\\".

Marion Jones, who played the wife, had recently appeared in A Season in Hell for Safran. It was writer Chris Garner's third TV play after Dark Under the Sun and The House of Mancello. Reception The Canberra Times said the play \\"was bogged down with a dull pedestrian script. The basic idea had possibilities but the writer needs to learn about his craft, especially the art of creating characters through the dialogue. The actors were uninteresting.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"For stupefying banality of idea and sentiment it would have been hard to surpass Chris Gardner's homiletic Private Island\\", saying \\"the remorseless predictability of the play's action and dialogue must have ended even the most sympathetic viewer's attempt to accept it as other than a moralistic charade.\\" Radio version Gardner also adapted the play for radio for the ABC. It aired in 1965 starring Richard Meikle as the agent. Reviewing that production the Sydney Morning Herald said \\"the players overcame the limitations of script to involve the listener\\" adding Gardner \\"wrote from confused values.

Rocky ridges are visible in the Eastern part of the village — outcrops of volcanic tuff (Greenstone rocks) Silurian system. As the whole Sverdlovsk oblast Isetskoye is located in the time zone of Ekaterinburg. The offset from UTC is +5:00. Concerning Moscow time the time zone has a constant offset +2 hours and is designated in Russia as MSK+2. History Temnaya settlement was founded around 1645 on the left side of the Iset river. Villagers were engaged in farming, carting and trading grain products. In 1702 the village was burnt by Bashkirs. Temnaya was rebuilt in several years. First church was built in 1845. It was named by St. Nicholas. The parish school was opened on March 1886. During the events of The Russian Revolution of 1905 the filial of the social democratic party was established by villagers. The church\`s building was made of wood. The Perm construction division has approved the final stone draft of the new Church in 1913. Construction work was carried out until the Russian Revolution of 1917. Funding was stopped. The priest of St. Nicholas Church was shot by bolsheviks. Later the building of church was burnt and half-destroyed. Population Transport There is shuttle bus #102 twice a day (from Kamensk-Uralsky to Sosnovckoe).

I thought 60 percent of what we did was okay and 40 percent I thought was dreadful. I recall doing several one-act plays by Australians but nothing memorable.

These two were the first in a series of ten plays made by the ABC in 1960 using local writers, others including The Astronauts and The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day. (Other plays possibly included Close to the Roof, Dark Under the Sun, The Square Ring, Who Killed Kovali?, and Swamp Creatures.) Plot A man breaks into homes at night and terrorises women. He eludes police for two years. In the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, a woman, Ruth Arnott, fears that a man in her own house, a man oppressed by his mother, may be the attacker. The opening scenes take place at Victorian Police Headquarters with the rest at a house in Sunshine.

By intermarriage and cultural assimilation it became part of the Russian-German population in the Russian Empire. Its most famous member is Alexander Van der Bellen, the President of Austria. Family members held high offices in the regional government of the Pskov area in Imperial Russia and the family was recognised as noble by Russian authorities in the early 19th century. After the Russian Revolution, family members fled to Estonia and, following the Soviet invasion of that country, to Germany and Austria. History The family is descended from Johann Abraham van der Bellen, who moved to the Russian Empire in the 18th century. According to Russian official records, he was born in the Netherlands. In 1787 he volunteered for service with the Military Hospital in Moscow. Around 1793 he moved to Pskov, and became a military doctor. He was involved in the construction of the local hospital and refused to receive any pay for his work. During the 1806–1807 War of the Fourth Coalition, he took responsibility for the care of French prisoners of war and bought medical equipment and housing for them with his own resources. In 1801 he married the Russian-German noblewoman Elisabeth von Römer in Pskov. In the early 19th century the family was recognised as noble in the Russian Empire. Aleksander von der Bellen, a liberal politician, became head of the Pskov government before the Russian Revolution. After the revolution, he and his sons fled to Estonia.

It is the sequel to Mushroom Wars, and was released on iOS and tvOS on October 13, 2016 and is also available on Android and Steam. Versions for PlayStation 4, and Xbox One are expected to follow soon. The game is set in a fictional woodland world, where armies of mushrooms face off in dynamic real-time strategy battles. The player picks one of the heroes, characters with unique abilities, to lead the mushroom armies and commands them to take control of the battlefield in a variety of multiplayer modes with leagues, ranked matches and award system or single-player campaigns with customizable difficulty settings. Building upon the core Mushroom Wars gameplay, Mushrooms Wars 2 features four campaign episodes, one for each tribe of mushroom folk, and competitive multiplayer for up to four people with two-player cooperative mode.  Gameplay  In Mushroom Wars 2, players command armies in dynamic short-session matches, capturing buildings of opponents, which requires strategic resource management, fast reflexes, and the ability to oversee up to thousands of units at once. Mushroom Wars 2 features four episodes of story- driven campaign, 50 missions each. A plotless multiplayer mode with custom game option lets players try out new strategies with up to three friends in free-for-all or team-based matches. Skirmish mode also lets players fight against artificial intelligence opponents (computer-controlled). Before the match, players choose one of several hero characters from 4 mushroom tribes: Shrooms - Rudo or Ayner, Proteus - Marty'O or Cree, Shii'Moris - Stella or Trini, Grims - Pahom or Ankh. Each character has different skills attributable to his specific tribe and applicable to a certain territory or certain buildings. Special abilities bar is filled by the souls of soldiers who die in battles, so the more player fights, the faster he can open one of four unique skills of his character. There are three types of buildings: villages that produce units, towers that defend a certain radius of territory and forges that create weapons to make the army stronger. Villages can be upgraded three times - the higher the level of upgrade, the more units they fit in and produce troopers faster. Towers can also be upgraded three times, each time increasing their effective radius and rate of attacks. Forges cannot be upgraded. Buildings can be converted into buildings of other types and back. Players expand their influence on the map by growing armies in the base villages they start from and by capturing neutral buildings or the ones of opponents. There are several winning conditions, different for each match: destroying all the opposing armies by capturing all the buildings on the map; capturing specific buildings faster than the opponents; being first to have the points counted down to zero. A player is defeated if all of his units are destroyed, it also takes capturing all of his buildings.  Development  Concept of Mushroom Wars 2 was formalized in 2014, when some of the developers of the original Mushroom Wars joined developer Zillion Whales. As soon as the first playable prototype was created, the team started showcasing the game at various conferences, e.g. Comic Con in St. Petersburg, GDC in San Francisco, Gamescom in Cologne. The game is developed using Unity with custom C++ render- plugin.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, Argentina and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. There were 1,522 reports of tornadoes in the United States in 2017, of which 1,418 were confirmed. Worldwide, 41 fatalities have been confirmed in 2017: 35 in the United States, five in China and one in Brazil. The tornado season in 2017 started exceptionally early, having the second most active January since records began in 1950, and one of the most active first quarters in recorded history. 2017 also had four high risk outlooks issued by the Storm Prediction Center, making this the most active in the sense of high risk outlooks since 2011, which had a total of five high risk outlooks issued throughout the entire year. Events =United States yearly total= January Extreme levels of tornadic activity took place in January. There were 142 preliminary reports of tornadoes in the United States in January, of which 135 were confirmed. This is nearly 4 times the monthly average of 35, and the most active January since 1999. =January 2= On December 26, 2016, the Storm Prediction Center noted the potential for a severe risk to evolve across the Southern United States in the extended range. On December 31, a slight risk of severe weather was noted from southeastern Texas through far western Alabama. The risk area was shifted eastward and heightened to an enhanced risk the following day, with the SPC warning of the potential for damaging wind gusts and a strong tornado or two. A mesoscale convective system developed across eastern Texas early on January 2, aided by the combination of a strong upper-level trough, a moderately unstable atmosphere, and sufficient moisture. As the convection progressed east, hundreds of damaging wind reports and numerous tornado reports were received. The Louisiana towns of Bunkie and Hessmer sustained moderate damage from EF1 tornadoes. An EF2 tornado destroyed chicken houses and caused tree damage near Mount Olive, Mississippi, while another EF2 struck Rehobeth, Alabama, causing considerable damage at a local festival grounds. Rear flank downdraft winds away from the Rehobeth tornado killed four people when a large tree crushed a mobile home. Three separate EF2 tornadoes occurred near Blakely and Arlington, Georgia, causing major tree damage, destroying farm structures, and causing severe roof damage to a few homes. Overall, this outbreak produced 36 tornadoes. Damage from the storm system exceeded US$250 million. =January 15–16= The SPC first highlighted a severe weather threat area along and south of the Red River in Texas on January 12, valid three days later. A Slight risk was introduced farther southwest over West Texas on January 13, with subsequent shifts northeast. With a negatively-tilted upper-level low across the Southwest United States, abundant moisture and strong upper-level winds overspread the risk area, and the SPC warned of semi-discrete/line- embedded supercells capable of large hail, damaging winds, and isolated tornadoes. A total of 11 tornadoes touched down on January 15 through the next morning, including two EF2s that impacted areas near Gatesville, Texas and Brady, Texas. An EF0 tornado caused minor damage in Grand Prairie, Texas, while an EF1 damaged multiple homes in Clifton. = January 21–23 = EF3 damage to a house in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. In the pre-dawn hours of January 21, a complex of strong thunderstorms affected the Gulf Coast states, where the SPC had issued an Enhanced risk of severe weather. The possibility of discrete cells forming ahead of this complex was mentioned, and one such cell led to the formation of a large and destructive EF3 tornado from 09:35 UTC to 10:13 UTC across Lamar, Forrest, and Perry counties in Mississippi. Traveling along a 31.3-mile (50.4 km) path, the EF3 heavily affected sections of Hattiesburg, where 4 deaths occurred. Later that day, a Moderate risk was issued across portions of southern Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana, and western Mississippi. Although the risk area was issued explicitly for the threat of large hail, several tornadoes were assessed to have touched down, including two EF2 tornadoes that impacted areas east of Plain Dealing and Natchez, Louisiana. During the early morning hours of January 22, a devastating EF3 tornado impacted portions of Brooks, Cook, and Berrien counties—most notably in areas around Adel—killing 11 people. Later that day, a severe weather and tornado outbreak was expected to occur across northern Florida and southern Georgia, prompting the SPC to issue their first High risk since June 3, 2014, and the first in the winter months since the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak. An extremely large EF3 wedge tornado affected the southern and eastern reaches of Albany, killing 4 people and injuring more than 50 others. Another person in Albany succumbed to her injuries and died on January 26. This outbreak killed 20 people and injured many more, making it the second deadliest January tornado outbreak since 1950, behind the 1969 Hazlehurst, Mississippi tornado outbreak. February Similar to the previous month, above average activity occurred in February. There were 115 preliminary reports of tornadoes in the United States in February, of which 69 were confirmed. This is over twice the national average of 29 tornadoes. = February 7 = Michoud area of New Orleans East A localized outbreak of 15 tornadoes impacted Southern United States on February 7. A few of these tornadoes were strong, with the most significant damage occurring in Louisiana. A large EF2 wedge tornado destroyed homes near Killian, Louisiana. An EF1 tornado caused considerable damage in the town of Donaldsonville, killing one person. A large, damaging tornado of EF3 intensity ripped through portions of Eastern New Orleans, damaging or destroying numerous homes, businesses, and industrial buildings. Another EF3 tornado near Watson toppled metal truss towers and destroyed manufactured homes. At least 33 people were injured by the New Orleans tornado with up to 6 being serious. An EF2 tornado also damaged multiple homes and destroyed a flea market near Harperville, Mississippi. = February 19–20 = Scattered tornadoes impacted the state of Texas on February 19 and 20. This included an EF2 and an EF1 tornado that moved through densely populated parts of San Antonio, Texas. The San Antonio tornadoes caused major roof damage to numerous homes, apartment buildings, and businesses along their paths, and downed numerous trees. EF0 tornadoes also caused minor damage in Windcrest and Garden Ridge. Two simultaneous EF2 tornadoes caused significant damage to grain silos, homes, train cars, and power poles in and around the town of Thrall as well. = February 25 = Five tornadoes struck on February 25 in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Massachusetts. An EF2 in Pennsylvania damaged a metal horse barn, severely damaged two houses, and caused varying degrees of damage to 28 additional houses. An EF1 in Massachusetts caused damage to two houses in Goshen. Farther east, in and near Conway, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and several other houses were severely damaged. This tornado was the first Massachusetts tornado on record during the month of February. = February 28 – March 1= EF3 damage to a glass plant in Naplate, Illinois. A strong storm complex produced a significant and widespread tornado outbreak in and around the Ohio Valley and the Midwest. A moderate risk was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for Tuesday, February 28. This included a 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes. Several damaging tornadoes touched down, including a violent EF4 that leveled and swept away homes at the north edge of Perryville, Missouri and killed one person. An EF3 struck the towns of Naplate and Ottawa, Illinois and killed two people, while a fourth person was killed as a result of a long-track EF3 that passed near Crossville, Illinois and into Indiana. An EF3 tornado also caused severe damage in and around the town of Washburn, Illinois. This was the most intense February tornado outbreak to affect Illinois since 1950, with at least three tornadoes of EF3 or greater intensity, including the Ottawa event, which was the northernmost February EF3 on record in the state of Illinois. The tornado that impacted the Perryville area tracked at least 50 miles and was also the first violent tornado of 2017. Overall, this outbreak produced 72 tornadoes and killed four people. March March continued the above average trend of the previous months. There were 176 preliminary reports of tornadoes in the United States during March, but 194 were confirmed. That set a new monthly record for March. Notably, March reached above average activity in merely the first week, with two major outbreaks occurring in the span of 6 days. = March 6–7 = EF2 damage to a manufacturing facility in the southern part of Centerville, Iowa. Following the issuance of an enhanced risk for severe weather from the Storm Prediction Center; including a 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes, an outbreak of strong tornadoes impacted the Midwest and Ohio Valley for the second time in the matter of days. Most of the tornadoes occurred during the nighttime and early morning hours, and were embedded in a large quasi-linear convective system. This included an EF3 that impacted the southern part of Oak Grove, Missouri, damaging or destroying nearly 500 buildings and injuring 12 people. A high-end EF2 tornado damaged or destroyed multiple homes near Smithville and Lathrop in Missouri. In Iowa, the towns of Muscatine, Centerville, and Seymour all sustained significant damage from EF2 tornadoes. Another EF2 caused heavy damage in Parthenon, Arkansas. An EF1 that touched down near the town of Bricelyn, Minnesota was the earliest Minnesota tornado on record. A total of 63 tornadoes occurred as a result of this outbreak, and numerous reports of hail and damaging straight-line winds were received as well. No fatalities occurred, though 19 people were injured. = March 9 = A total of 17 tornadoes touched down in the states of Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky, including an EF2 that crossed from Missouri into Kentucky near Hickman, Kentucky. The tornado damaged a few sheds, destroyed several grain bins, and blew over some irrigation pivots. Another EF2 formed in Hickman, damaging 45 structures, knocking down numerous power poles, and snapping or uprooting many trees. The tornado briefly continued into Tennessee before dissipating. Near Doniphan, Missouri, an EF2 tornado moved through heavily forested areas, snapping and uprooting thousands of trees along its path and destroying a barn. An EF1 occurred in the southern part of Murray, Kentucky and caused extensive damage to two dugouts at a high school which had their roofs torn off and hurled, a well-built steel barn was damaged, and a building was destroyed by falling trees. Another EF1 struck the town of Bernie, Missouri, causing moderate damage to several homes. = March 9 (Germany) = A highly photogenic F1 tornado accompanied by a rainbow was recorded and photographed in Kürnach, Germany and caused considerable damage to the roofs of 20 to 30 homes. Two trees were blown over and one garden shed was also blown down. An additional 80 houses were reportedly damaged to a lesser extent. = March 12 (Brazil) = A tornado occurred near Canguçu in southern Rio Grande do Sul. A large number of trees were blown over and/or debarked and wind-blown vegetation showed evidence of rotation. Less than 10 hours afterwards, another tornado touched down in the city of São Francisco de Paula, where more than 400 houses were damaged, 40 of which were destroyed. Trees were snapped, zinc tiles were stripped from roofs, and metal structures were twisted. A 24-year-old man was killed as a result of the tornado.http://jcrs.uol.com.br/_conteudo/2017/03/geral/551406-cidade-da-serra- foi-atingida-por-tornado-afirma-metsul.html = March 24 = A total of 11 tornadoes impacted the states of Washington, Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas. The first tornado of the event was an EF0 tornado that struck the Vancouver, Washington suburb of Orchards, causing minor tree and property damage. Later that day, an EF2 occurred near Marshall, Texas and snapped or uprooted many trees, destroyed a metal outbuilding, damaged multiple carports, and ripped roofing off several residences. Another EF2 tornado passed near the town of Gibson, Arkansas and destroyed four mobile homes and damaged several others. A third EF2 ripped the roof off a house and caused heavy damage to other structures near Lonsdale, Arkansas as well. A large EF1 wedge tornado passed near Natchitoches, Louisiana and damaged a metal warehouse, a pool supply building, and several outbuildings and homes. Another EF1 near Stanley started out as a waterspout that moved ashore, lifting three boats out of the water; two were launched 250-300 yards (230–270 m) while the other was deposited in the back yard of a house. Several homes were also damaged by this tornado. No fatalities or serious injuries occurred as a result of this event. = March 28–31 = A four-day outbreak of 39 tornadoes impacted the Southern United States and Mid-Atlantic regions. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though a few EF2 tornadoes occurred, including one that struck the town of Oakdale, Louisiana and caused considerable damage to homes and businesses. Another EF2 tornado near Midkiff, Texas snapped many power poles, displaced grain silos, and damaged an outbuilding. The most significant tornado of the event was an EF2 that struck parts of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach, Virginia, heavily damaging numerous homes, downing many trees, and partially destroying a church. In addition, several weak EF0 and EF1 tornadoes impacted parts of the Houston metro as well as the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, resulting in relatively minor damage. No fatalities or serious injuries occurred as a result of this outbreak. April There were 218 tornadoes reported in the United States in April, of which 215 were confirmed. Similar to the other months, April reached above average activity. The long-term monthly average is 155 tornado reports. =April 2–3= On April 2, the Storm Prediction Center issued a high risk for severe weather, including a 30% risk area for tornadoes across northern Louisiana into far eastern Texas. Strong, long-track tornadoes were expected to occur in the region. Early that day, an EF1 tornado near Breaux Bridge, Louisiana killed a mother and daughter after destroying their mobile home while they were inside of it. Another EF1 struck Alexandria, causing considerable damage to homes and businesses. Later that afternoon and evening, multiple strong tornadoes touched down in the threat area. Several of these tornadoes were large and wedge shaped, though none exceeded EF2 in intensity. One of these EF2 tornadoes struck Belah and Trout, toppling metal truss towers, snapping many trees and power poles, and collapsing a boat business. Another EF2 struck Aimwell, damaging several homes and a church. An EF2 tornado near Winnsboro tossed trailers and mobile homes, and also destroyed a small home. Several tornadoes continued to touch down across parts of the Southern United States the following day, including an EF1 that killed one person after destroying a mobile home near Whitmire, South Carolina. An EF2 tornado near Cameron snapped many trees and power poles, and destroyed several barns and metal storage buildings. Several businesses in the downtown portion of Gordon, Georgia sustained significant damage as a result of an EF2 tornado as well. Overall, the outbreak produced 59 tornadoes and resulted three fatalities. =April 4–6= An EF2 tornado struck the town of Goodman, Missouri during a severe weather outbreak that began on April 4, causing major structural damage to an elementary school and multiple other buildings in the town, including homes and a fire station as well. Numerous trees were also uprooted or blown down. An EF1 also struck a chicken farm near Seligman, Missouri the same day, while another EF1 occurred near Bergman, Arkansas, damaging homes and destroying a garage and a mobile home. A more significant and widespread outbreak of severe weather was anticipated on April 5, with the Storm Prediction Center initially issuing a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms across parts of the Southern United States. At 16:29 UTC, the SPC upgraded the moderate risk to a high risk for parts of Georgia and South Carolina in anticipation of what was expected to be a major tornado outbreak. However, a mainly unidirectional wind profile was present in the threat area that day, though explosive CAPE values and very steep lapse rates in combination with locally enhanced helicity due to outflow boundaries left behind by earlier storms were expected to compensate for this. Despite these factors, the outbreak of strong and destructive tornadoes that was expected did not occur, aided in part by cold-air damming in northern Georgia, along with large amounts of stratiform rain and shower activity occurring in parts of the state as well as in the Florida Panhandle. This blocked adequate moisture and lapse rates from building, and caused stabilization of the atmosphere in some parts of the threat area. Despite the reduced threat, a large EF2 wedge tornado touched down near Bakerhill, Alabama and continued into Georgia before dissipating near Morris, causing major tree damage, ripping much of the roof off a brick house, and damaging several other structures. Another EF2 wedge tornado tracked from the eastern part of Johnston, South Carolina and directly through Ward, causing damage to a few homes and businesses and snapping or uprooting many trees. A large and damaging EF2 also tracked from just east of Cadwell, Georgia to near Soperton, destroying an auto body shop, multiple outbuildings, a radio antennae, and much of the second floor of a two-story home. Near Weston, chicken houses, outbuildings, a mobile home, and a peanut farm storage building were destroyed as a result of another EF2 tornado. Weak tornadoes also touched down in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama as well, including rare anticyclonic EF1 tornadoes near Shelbyville, Tennessee and Eminence, Kentucky. On April 6, an enhanced risk for severe weather was issued for parts of the Mid-Atlantic region, and several additional tornadoes touched down. This included an EF0 tornado that touched down in Arlington, Virginia and moved directly into downtown Washington D.C. The D.C. tornado damaged light poles in the Pentagon parking lot, downed trees near the George Mason Memorial, and damaged the roof of the St. Aloysius Church. After the initial D.C. tornado dissipated, a second EF0 tornado downed several trees at Bolling Air Force Base, blowing the roof off of an apartment building and damaging flag posts. Further south, an isolated EF2 tornado near Yeehaw Junction, Florida downed many trees and damaged 20 homes, including three manufactured homes that were destroyed. Overall, this outbreak produced 38 tornadoes and no fatalities. =April 28 – May 1= EF4 damage to a two-story brick house southwest of Canton, Texas. Numerous tornadoes ripped through the central United States as a powerful storm system developed in the Rockies. Mainly EF0 and EF1 tornadoes were seen on April 28. Tornadoes made multiple appearances in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas on this day. Massive swaths of large hail up to two inches (5.1 cm) in diameter and wind speeds up to 81 mph (135 km/h) were also reported on April 28. On April 29, two long-lived and particularly dangerous tornadoes ripped through the Canton, Texas area, killing four people and injuring many others. One tornado was rated EF3 and the other was rated EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. April 30 saw a total of 41 tornadoes touch down in Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. An EF2 tornado killed one person and caused considerable damage in the town of Durant, Mississippi. Tornadoes were not the only threat with this storm complex as a large number of Flash Flood Watches went up in areas the storms were impacting. Isolated rainfall totals up to eleven inches were seen in far south Indiana and parts of Missouri. The heavy rainfall combined with the strong winds from the severe thunderstorms allowed for trees to be brought down easily in locations that received excessive rainfall. Streets were reported to be impassable and some roads were even closed due to the heavy rains. A few generally weak tornadoes were scattered around on May 1. Tornadoes were not the primary threat on May 1; however straight line winds in excess of 85 mph (137 km/h) were reported throughout the eastern seaboard of the United States. Overall, this outbreak produced 75 tornadoes and 20 deaths. Only five of the deaths were a direct result of tornadoes, while other deaths occurred from the flooding and heavy snow the storm system brought as well. May There were 299 tornadoes reported in the United States in May, of which 288 were confirmed. =May 15–20= Aerial view of the Prairie Lakes Estates mobile home park near Chetek, Wisconsin, where one person was killed by an EF3 tornado on May 16\\\\. Throughout a six-day period, starting on May 15, numerous tornadoes occurred across portions of the Great Plains, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, some of which were strong. The most significant activity occurred on May 16, as numerous tornadoes touched down across the Great Plains states and as far north as Wisconsin. A high-end EF2 tornado struck the southern part of Elk City, Oklahoma, damaging or destroying numerous homes and businesses, tossing vehicles, and killing one person. Another strong tornado caused damage to homes in the town of Pawnee Rock, Kansas before it passed near Great Bend, debarking trees and completely destroying farm homes at high- end EF3 strength. Another EF3 tornado moved through four counties in Wisconsin, destroying a mobile home park near Chetek, snapping and uprooting countless trees, and destroying a frame home near Conrath. The Chetek/Conrath tornado was officially the longest-tracked tornado in Wisconsin state history, and killed one person while injuring 25 others. Tornado activity was not as intense on May 17, though an EF2 embedded in a squall line ripped the roof off of a house near Galva, Illinois, injuring one person. By May 18, a major outbreak of strong tornadoes was expected across the Great Plains, and a high risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center. However, most of the tornadoes that occurred that afternoon an evening were weak, with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred in parts of Texas and Oklahoma. One of these EF2s struck the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, causing major damage to trees, apartment buildings, and industrial buildings. A separate EF1 tornado also impacted the western part of Muskogee, causing additional damage to homes and businesses, as well as downing many trees. Numerous EF0 and EF1 tornadoes were observed across multiple states on May 18 and 19 before the outbreak came to an end. Overall, this outbreak sequence produced 134 tornadoes and killed 2 people. =May 23–24= A potent storm system made its way throughout the southern and midwestern portions of the United States on May 23. A high-end EF1 which touched down in Autryville, North Carolina destroyed a mobile home and the Autryville Volunteer Fire Department, causing one minor injury. Further south in Georgia, an EF2 touched down in Wilmington Island and continued to the Fort Pulaski National Monument, where the visitor center sustained damage. The tornado then entered the Atlantic Ocean as a waterspout and capsized the fishing vessel Miss Debbie. The three crew members aboard were presumed dead on May 27 after a multi-day search. Tornado activity continued on May 24, with multiple tornadoes striking the Carolinas, including four strong EF2 tornadoes. One of these EF2 tornadoes heavily damaged an elementary school near Yadkinville, North Carolina, while another caused major tree and house damage near Statesville. Another EF2 tornado damaged a YMCA camp near Hanging Rock State Park. Near Saluda, South Carolina, an EF2 downed many trees and destroyed several outbuildings. Further north, the towns of Ironton and Park Layne, Ohio sustained considerable damage from EF1 tornadoes. Overall, this outbreak produced 37 tornadoes and killed three people.  June  168 tornadoes were reported in the United States in June, of which 142 were confirmed. =June 12–14= EF2 tornado near Carpenter, Wyoming. On June 12, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms across southeast Wyoming, northwest Nebraska, and southwest South Dakota. The risk area included a 15% hatched area for tornadoes across southeastern Wyoming, and a 45% hatched area for severe hail across the entire moderate risk area. In the early afternoon, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch across the hatched area for tornadoes, as supercells began to form along the northern part of a cold front. Several tornadoes touched down in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, including four EF2 tornadoes. One of these tornadoes was caught on video and photographed by numerous storm chasers as it passed near Carpenter, Wyoming, causing severe damage to outbuildings, vehicles, power poles, and homes in the area. An EF2 near Torrington tossed vehicles and horse trailers, heavily damaged a home, killed three horses, and injured two people. Another EF2 near Kaycee snapped many trees and destroyed a mobile home. In Nebraska, a long- track, multiple-vortex EF2 tornado passed near Bayard, tearing the roof and an exterior wall from a house, denuding trees, twisting irrigation pivots, damaging outbuildings, and destroying a garage. A separate brief EF1 tornado touched down in Bayard, causing considerable damage to a nursing home. In the late afternoon and early evening, the supercells merged into a squall line and produced isolated damaging wind gusts across South Dakota. The next day, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe weather, including a 10% risk area for tornadoes across parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota. In the mid-afternoon, supercells began to form along a cold front in eastern South Dakota. Additionally, numerous severe thunderstorms formed along the front from Minnesota to Texas. The storms produced multiple weak tornadoes throughout the risk area, none of which exceeded EF1 in intensity. By early evening, the cells merged into a squall line and continued east. The squall line continued to produce a few more tornadoes, in addition to large hail and damaging straight-line winds. On June 14, the squall line continued to produce wind damage, as well as producing a few more weak tornadoes in Wisconsin, all of which did relatively minor damage. Overall, this outbreak produced 40 tornadoes and did not result in any fatalities. =June 16= Two tornadoes spawned by semi-discrete supercell thunderstorms embedded within a larger line of severe storms produced severe damage in the southern suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska on the evening of June 16. One of these tornadoes was a high-end EF2 that downed many trees and caused major structural damage to homes as it moved through multiple subdivisions in the southern part of Bellevue. The other tornado was an EF1 that struck Offutt Air Force Base, moving planes from their original locations, downing trees, and damaging the roofs of several structures. Several other weak tornadoes were observed across parts of Nebraska and Kansas that evening. In addition, an EF1 tornado struck Pascagoula, Mississippi, causing considerable structural damage to commercial buildings. A total of 10 tornadoes were confirmed. =June 28= A small outbreak of tornadoes affected the Midwestern United States, with the most intense tornadoes touching down in Iowa. The most significant tornado of the event was an EF2 that struck the small town of Prairieburg, Iowa, where a grain elevator sustained major damage, mobile homes were destroyed, and trees were snapped. An EF2 tornado near Monticello destroyed garages, outbuildings, and grain bins, while another EF2 near Sidney ripped the roof off of a home, snapped trees, and destroyed outbuildings. Multiple other weak tornadoes were observed across parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, and Illinois. A total of 27 tornadoes were confirmed.  July  83 tornadoes were reported in the United States in July, of which 82 were confirmed. =July 11–12= A small two-day outbreak of tornadoes impacted the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes regions of the United States, with a majority of the tornadoes touching down in the state of North Dakota. This included a large, high-end EF2 multiple-vortex tornado on July 11 that passed near the town of Buxton, snapping and uprooting many trees and destroying outbuildings as it impacted multiple farmsteads. The same parent supercell storm produced another high-end EF2 tornado that destroyed barns, power poles, and grain bins near Halstad, Minnesota. A third EF2 tornado near Ulen, Minnesota tossed hay bales more than a half-mile through the air, snapped many trees, and destroyed a shed. A few weak tornadoes also occurred on July 12, including an EF0 that downed many trees in East Bethel, Minnesota, some of which landed on homes, vehicles, and outbuildings. Overall, this outbreak produced 18 tornadoes and did not result in any fatalities. =July 20= Four tornadoes touched down in upstate New York on July 20.

In total no fatalities from these devastating tornadoes. =July 24= During the very early morning hours of July 24, a strong waterspout spawned by an isolated supecell thunderstorm formed over Chesapeake Bay. Moving across Kent Island, the destructive EF2 tornado caused major damage in Stevensville, Maryland. Homes, townhouses, a church, a business, and a warehouse building were all severely damaged or destroyed by the tornado. Vehicles were flipped, a boat was thrown, gas leaks occurred, and trees and metal power poles were downed. One person was injured by flying debris. A brief EF0 tornado was also confirmed near Snydertown, Pennsylvania. August 145 tornadoes were reported in the United States in August, of which 116 were confirmed. =August 6= EF2 damage to the 18-story Remington Tower office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During the early morning hours of August 6, a high-end EF2 tornado touched down in the southeastern part of Tulsa, Oklahoma, forming along the leading edge of a bow echo within the eastern segment of a mesoscale convective complex that began sweeping through the state on the evening of August 5. The tornado began at 1:19 a.m. CDT (06:19 UTC) in a residential neighborhood east of South Harvard Avenue and south of East 36th Street South. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of snapped trees and tree limbs and was rated EF1. The tornado crossed South Yale Avenue, causing additional EF1 damage as wooden power poles were snapped. A nearby 10-story mid-rise Charles Schwab Corporation office building had minor exterior damage and a few broken windows. The tornado then reached high- end EF2 strength as it moved down East 41st Street, damaging or destroying numerous businesses in this area. A T.G.I. Friday's location in the Highland Plaza shopping district sustained collapse of its roof and exterior walls, and at least 8 people had to be rescued from that location. A dentist's office sustained major structural damage, while a Chipotle, a Whataburger, and an AT&T; store had their roofs ripped off. The tornado caused infrastructure damage to the BOK Financial Corporation's operations center, disabling its online, mobile and automated telephone systems. Several other businesses and structures sustained major damage in this area, a large billboard was blown over, and vehicles were flipped. Damage to ten of the affected businesses in the Highland Plaza district was so severe that city management designated them to be condemned. Just past this area, the tornado struck the 18-story Remington Tower office building along Skelly Drive. The tower sustained major damage to its facade and exterior, and had many windows blown out. A nearby hotel was also damaged. Continuing eastward, the tornado entered an industrial area of southeastern Tulsa. An industrial building along East 42nd Street sustained EF2 damage, losing its roof and large portions of its masonry exterior walls. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity as it moved along an east-southeasterly path through industrial areas, causing minor to moderate damage to warehouses and industrial buildings. Structures in this area had roofing and paneling removed, and some had portions of exterior walls blown out. Power poles were snapped as well. Continuing at EF1 strength, the tornado crossed South Memorial Drive and impacted a residential neighborhood, where trees and tree limbs were downed and homes had windows blown out. The EF1 tornado then crossed South Mingo Road into another industrial area, where several industrial buildings were damaged. Crossing U.S. Route 64 and following East 51st Street South to the east, the tornado continued to produce EF1 damage as a motel and an industrial building sustained damage, and several trees and power poles were downed before the tornado dissipated near the intersection of East 51st Street South and South 145th East Avenue. A total of 30 people were injured by the tornado. The rare August tornado, the first to hit the Tulsa area since 1958 (and only the third to strike the area since official tornado records began being kept in 1950), injured 26 people – with two experiencing serious injuries – in the eastern part of the city. Despite the presence of strong low-level rotation that was detected on radar, the Tulsa County Emergency Management Agency did not activate civil defense sirens in Tulsa proper as the local National Weather Service forecast office did not issue a tornado warning until 1:25 a.m. CDT (06:25 UTC), two minutes before it spawned an EF1 tornado that spanned a track across Broken Arrow, causing roof damage to numerous homes and bringing down several large tree limbs in the suburb. A second EF1 touched down east of Oologah at 1:32 a.m. CDT (06:32 UTC), damaging several trees, barns and one home, and downed several electrical poles. A fourth, weak tornado was later confirmed through damage surveys six miles south of Chelsea, which touched down at 2:11 a.m. (07:11 UTC) and uprooted several large trees; this tornado was rated as an EF1. =August 11 (China)= An EF4 tornado killed 5 people when it struck Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, injuring 50. https://www.shundemos.com/zixunInfo.aspx$id=136158.htm =August 25–31 (Hurricane Harvey)= Category 4 Hurricane Harvey produced a seven-day outbreak of tornadoes across the Southern United States during and after its landfall along the Texas coast. A majority of these tornadoes were weak, though some impacted the Greater Houston area. On August 29, an EF2 tornado near Evangeline, Louisiana area damaged vehicles, destroyed homes, and snapped or uprooted many trees. The final day of the outbreak was the most significant, with numerous tornadoes touching down across Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee on August 31, including two EF2 tornadoes. One of these EF2 tornadoes struck the town of Reform, Alabama, damaging or destroying several homes and mobile homes, snapping many trees, flipping vehicles, and injuring 6 people. The same tornado heavily damaged a fire station in Palmetto as well.

On the night of October 21, several tornadoes were reported in Oklahoma. One of these was a high-end EF1 that impacted the southwestern fringes of Norman in the vicinity of Interstate 35 and Oklahoma State Highway 9. The tornado caused damage to trees and power poles, and damaged or destroyed several metal sheds and outbuildings. The touchdown of the tornado was seen on live television as storm chasers Val and Amy Castor from KWTV-DT were in the immediate vicinity of the tornado when it formed, causing light damage to their vehicle as it passed directly overhead. The tornado also did damage to part of the Riverwind Casino, which at the time was hosting a Beach Boys concert attended by Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. Despite the damage, no injuries were reported. Another EF1 tornado struck the town of Seminole, where there was considerable damage to homes, businesses, trees, and a church. Tornado activity on October 22 was limited to a single EF1 that injured one person and caused moderate damage to a large industrial building and some trailers in Pascagoula, Mississippi; the second EF1 tornado to cause damage in Pascagoula in the year 2017. The most significant tornado activity occurred on October 23, as an EF1 tornado downed many trees and damaged several homes in Spartanburg, South Carolina. After the initial Spartanburg tornado dissipated, a second, stronger EF2 tornado caused major damage to industrial buildings, a metal truss tower, trees and power poles, a gas station, and vehicles in the northwestern part of the city, and injured one person. Another EF2 tornado damaged or destroyed multiple homes, destroyed outbuildings, and snapped trees and power poles near Gaffney.

November  46 tornadoes were reported in the United States in November, of which 42 were confirmed. =November 5= EF2 damage to a Dollar General store in Celina, Ohio. As multiple areas of low pressure rode along a strong cold front stretching across the Central United States and Ohio River Valley, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk of severe weather on November 5 across parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. This outlook included a 10% risk of tornadoes across the enhanced risk area. Later that day, severe thunderstorm began to organize in a modestly unstable, highly sheared environment spanning from Missouri to New York, resulting in a multitude of hail and wind reports. Rotating supercell thunderstorms developed across parts of the Ohio Valley late that afternoon and evening, and multiple tornadoes began touching down and causing damage. Ohio sustained the most significant impacts during the event, with multiple towns sustaining direct hits from tornadoes, some of which were strong and destructive. The first significant tornado of the event was a long-track, high-end EF2 wedge tornado that passed near the Indiana towns of Dunkirk and Portland before crossing into Ohio and dissipating west of Celina. This damaging tornado heavily damaged or destroyed many homes and manufactured homes, destroyed numerous barns, garages, storage buildings, and outbuildings, damaged a church, an auto repair shop, and a gas plant, snapped numerous trees and power poles, and injured one person along its path. A separate EF2 tornado struck Celina shortly after the initial tornado dissipated, blowing out windows and ripping the roofs off of businesses in town, heavily damaging a large factory building, snapping numerous trees and power poles, and injuring eight people. An EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to sheds, trees, and homes in West Lodi, while another EF1 damaged trees, the roofs of homes, and a heavy equipment sales business in South Vienna. One EF2 tornado struck Galion, tearing the roof off of a house, snapping trees, and severely damaging industrial buildings in town, while another brief EF2 obliterated a barn near Republic.

An EF1 tornado also struck Calcutta, where trees were downed and air conditioning units were ripped from the roof of a YMCA. Further to the east, an EF1 tornado moved through parts of Erie, Pennsylvania, damaging trees, homes, businesses, and a shopping plaza. Tornadoes also struck towns in Indiana that afternoon and evening, including a brief EF1 tornado that damaged roofs and trees in Muncie, and another EF1 that damaged structures in downtown Salem. In addition to the tornadoes, this severe weather outbreak produced multiple incidences of destructive straight-line winds, including 90-MPH thunderstorm winds that damaged restaurants, industrial buildings, businesses, mobile homes, and Findlay High School in Findlay, Ohio. In northeastern Ohio, a large and powerful macroburst with winds of up to 105-MPH caused significant damage in numerous towns and communities throughout Lorain, Medina, Cuyahoga, Summit, Portage and Geauga counties. These destructive winds shattered windows, stripped roofing and siding from homes, damaged a fire department communications tower, ripped the steeple off of a church, and downed countless trees and power poles across the affected area, with many landing on homes and vehicles. A microburst containing 100-MPH winds also impacted Boardman, where businesses were damaged by the strong winds, and numerous homes were damaged by falling trees, some significantly. With 16 tornadoes in Ohio alone, the November 5 outbreak marked the second-largest in state history for the month, behind only the Tornado outbreak of November 9–11, 2002.

The strongest tornado of the event was an EF2 near Wayland that snapped wooden power poles, destroyed a salt shelter building, and injured one person when a semi-truck was overturned. This tornado crossed into Iowa before dissipating. A third tornado caused EF1 damage to a home, an outbuilding, and some trees near Brumley as well. =December 19–20= The final tornado event of 2017 consisted of a small outbreak of 9 tornadoes that affected the Southern United States on December 19 and 20. Two EF2 tornadoes touched down in Texas on December 19, the first of which downed trees and concrete power poles near the town of Rusk, as well as damaging several roofs and outbuildings. The other was a large wedge tornado which blew a home off of its block foundation, snapped many trees, and lofted a small boat near Reklaw. Scattered weak tornadoes occurred in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia on December 20. An EF1 tornado damaged trees, barns, and roofs in the rural Texas community of Gist. The town of DeQuincy, Louisiana sustained considerable damage due to an EF1 tornado, where hangars were damaged at a small airport, a batting cage awning was blown down, homes and businesses sustained roof and window damage, many trees and power lines were downed, and a pavilion was destroyed at a local sports complex.

Launched in 1757, she was assigned to the Navy's Jamaica Station until August 1758 when she was captured by the French. She remained in French hands until being disarmed in 1759 and removed from service in 1760. Construction Stork was one of three vessels built to a 1755 design by Surveyor of the Navy William Bately, and collectively known as Alderney-class sloops in recognition of which was the first to be formally contracted for construction. This was Bately's first experience with vessel design, for which he substantially borrowed from the shape and dimensions of George IIs yacht HMY Royal Caroline, built in 1750 by Master Shipwright John Hollond.McLaughlin 2014, p. 208, 279 Bately then added to Hollond's hull design by lengthening the \\"fore-rake\\" – the area of the bow that extended beyond the keel – in order to improve the sloop's stability in heavy swell.McLaughlin 2014, p.208 Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 indicated that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, leaving the Royal Dockyards fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the larger ships of the line.Winfield 2007, pp.310–311 For previous Navy contracts the prices quoted by Thames River shipyards had proved exorbitant, and the Navy Board had evidence that the shipwrights were colluding to fix higher rates for construction work. In consequence only regional shipwrights were invited to bid for Stork, with the contract awarded on 17 December 1755 to Daniel Stow and Benjamin Bartlett of Shoreham-by-Sea. Contract terms stipulated that the vessel be completed within seven months at a cost of £7.12s.6d per ton burthen, well below the average rate of £9.0s per ton quoted by Thames River shipyards for Navy vessels of similar size.Baugh 1965, pp.255–256 The new vessel's keel was laid in early 1756 and work commenced on the hull. Bately's initial design was for a two-masted snow-rigged sloop, but this was modified in mid-1756 into a traditional three-masted ship rig to increase speed at the expense of manoeuvrability. When completed, the vessel was long with a keel, a beam of and a deep hold. Fitted out for Royal Navy service she was lightly armed with 10 four-pounder cannons ranged along her upper deck, accompanied by 12 -pounder swivel guns for anti-personnel use. The half-built sloop was formally christened Stork on 25 May 1756. However Stow and Bartlett ultimately failed to meet the contracted deadline of seven months for Storks construction, and the sloop was not launched until 8 November 1756. After launch she was sailed to Portsmouth Dockyard for fitting out and to take on guns and crew. Active service Stork was commissioned into the Navy her appointed captain, Commander William Tucker, in September 1756, while still under construction at Shoreham-by-Sea. Fitting out at Portsmouth was completed by 8 February 1757, including the loading of guns and stores. Her designated complement was 100, comprising two commissioned officers a captain and a lieutenant overseeing 9 warrant and 15 petty officers, 55 naval ratings, and 19 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp.348351 Among these other ranks were two positions reserved for widow's men fictitious crew members whose pay would subsequently be reallocated to the families of dead sailors. Despite her fit out, Stork was not immediately assigned a station at sea and remained anchored off Portsmouth. Tucker was promoted to captain in January 1757 and transferred away from Stork in May. He was replaced by Commander Peter Carteret who would remain with the vessel for rest of her Royal Navy service. Carteret brought Admiralty Orders for Stork to join the Navy squadron in Jamaica and assist with defending merchant shipping from French privateers. The sloop set sail for Jamaica on 30 June 1757 to take up this post, but her service was short-lived. On 6 August 1758 she encountered Le Palmier, a French 74-gun ship of the line, off the Hispaniola coast; the outgunned British vessel was surrendered without resistance, and her crew taken prisoner. Stork was promptly converted into a French Navy vessel of the same name, and joined the French Caribbean squadron based in Martinique. Her Royal Navy cannons were removed and transferred to larger vessels; in their place Stork received 14 French-made 4-pounder guns, two 3-pounders and 16 antiquated pierriers à boîte for anti-personnel use. By December 1759, after a year of uneventful service, even these guns were removed. Now entirely disarmed, Stork ceased to be of value and was deleted from French service; she last appears in Navy records in 1760.

Biography  Vincenzo Lanza, or Vincenzio (as he preferred to be called) was born in Foggia from a humble couple coming form Roseto Valfortore working as service personnel in Mr Saggese's estates. He spent the first years of his life in the hinterland, attending the Seminary of Ariano until he was 16, when he moved to Naples to study medicine. Very important for him was the figure of Domenico Cotugno, holder of the Chair of Protomedicato of the Reign (a sort of general management of Public Healthcare), even if he was also student of many important physicians of the time at the Ospedale degli Incurabili. On 20 October 1808 Lanza inaugurated a private clinic in the Ospedale della Pace, the first one in a Neapolitan hospital. In the same year he published a first book of Physiology, that can be considered as his graduation thesis. The following years were of great importance for his medical career, letting him reach prestigious positions in the scientific and educational environment. In 1811 Lanza received the licence to practice the medical profession and in 1817 his private clinic become a public one with the name of \\"Clinica dei nuovi sperimenti\\". In 1820 he wrote a letter to Giacomo Tommasini, about inflammation and fever (two important problems of the time), and five years later he published Gli elementi di medicina pratica analitica, dedicated to the same Tommasini. In 1831 he became full professor and holder of the second Chair of Medicina Pratica at Regia Università di Napoli. Between 1836 and 1837 an epidemic of cholera broke out and many physicians left Naples, but Lanza stayed there with some others to study and try to contain this phenomenon. In 1841 Lanza published Nosoloigia Positiva, the first Italian book of Pathology written by a clinician for clinicians. In 1846 he became Dean of the Medicine Department of the University and in 1848 was elected member of the Parliament of the Province of Naples. But during the night of 14 May the revolution broke out: the Parliament was prorogued and Lanza, along with many other patriots, was exiled. In the years of his exile he was in Rome, Capua, Genoa and Caserta until 1855, when he was able to return to Naples. In 1859 Lanza was called to the sickbed of Ferdinando II (come back seriously ill from a journey in Apulia) who died soon after. One year later, in 1860, Lanza died of apoplexy in his house in Via Toledo 413 in Naples.

Xunliao Bay is honored as a dazzling pearl among Guangdong coastal areas.Xunliao Bay Managemeng Committee Site. Accessed 11 October 2016 TOC The origins of the name According to folklores, there are mainly two kinds of origins of the name Xunliao. One is related to Su Shi, an eminent writer in the Earlier Song Dynasty (; 960–1127). Due to his against to Wang Anshi's Political Reforms (; 1019–1086), Su was banished to Huiyang District where he preferred traveling to Xunliao to avoid summer heat. At that time, Xunliao was named as \\"Yaliao\\" (Chinese: 鸭寮), however, Su found Daya Bay looked like the image of Bagua (Chinese: 八卦) and Xunliao just located at the direction of “Xun” (Chinese: 巽), which in Bagua represented \\"wind\\" (Chinese: 风). The “wind”echoes with the image of sea, and thus Su changed the name into “Xunliao”.China Tourism News Site. Accessed 4 December 2016 Official Tourist Information for Xunliao Bay. Accessed 11 October 2016 The other dates back to A.D. 1447 when the place was originally named Shunliao (Chinese: 顺寮); nevertheless, after its suffering from a fire calamity in the history, the locals started to regard the name as an ill omen. Finally, a divination helped people decide to use the character “Xun” in Bagua to replace \\"Shun\\" (Chinese: 顺) in order to avoid bad luck. Since then this area has been named as Xunliao. Tourism development Throughout history, the local people made a living on agriculture and fishery industry, which still has a space to develop though there is an increasing growth in living standards. In 1990s, however, with the attention and administration of the governments from the county, the city and the province, a tourist industry emerged, and since then, it has made a growing contribution to the local economy. Xunliao Bay, with particularly favorable natural conditions of tourism resources, is famous for its magnificently diverse stones, clear water and white sands.

Early life and career Mario Bonetti was born in Arezzo in 1888 and entered the Italian Naval Academy in Leghorn in 1906, graduating in 1909 with the rank of ensign.Biographical Dictionary Men of the Navy. His first assignments were on armored cruisers Pisa and San Marco; during the Italo-Turkish War Bonetti distinguished himself in command of landing parties in Derna and Tobruk, receiving the War Cross for Military Valor. During World War I, Bonetti served for 21 months on submarines with the rank of lieutenant, first on submarines F 7 and F 13 and later in command of F 10; during this period he received a Silver Medal of Military Valor. Later in the war he became executive officer of the destroyer Ardito, and he received a commendation for an action in September 1917. From 1920 to 1926 Bonetti, with the rank of lieutenant commander, commanded the hydrographic survey vessel Ammiraglio Magnaghi during various hydrographic campaigns in the seas of Italy (except for one year when he was attached to the Hydrographic Office in Genoa), and later the submarine N 3. In 1923 he graduated in nautical sciences and hydrography. In 1927 he was promoted to commander and given command of the scout cruiser Quarto, and then of submarines Balilla and Antonio Sciesa . Afterwards, he directed for three years the Hydrographic Institute, before being promoted to captain returned to the command of Ammiraglio Magnaghi and of the Hydrographic Survey Vessel Group which from 1934 to 1938 carried out several hydrographic campaigns in Red Sea. World War II and aftermath In November 1940 Bonetti was promoted to rear admiral, and at the end of the year he was sent to Eritrea and given command of the Naval High Command East Africa, with headquarters in Massawa. A few months later, while the Battle of Keren was being fought, it became clear that the fall of Eritrea and Massawa was only a matter of time; Bonetti devised a plan to save the few ships able to deal with an ocean travel, and the destruction of all remaining vessels to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. On his orders, submarines Perla, Galileo Ferraris, and Guglielmotti left Eritrea at the end of March 1941, headed to Bordeaux (home of the Italian Atlantic base Betasom), while the colonial ship Eritrea, the merchant ship Himalaya and auxiliary cruisers RAMB I and RAMB II sailed for Japan.the Scapa Flow in the Red Sea. Between March 31 and April 2, the last five remaining destroyers (Nazario Sauro, Daniele Manin, Cesare Battisti, Tigre, Leone and Pantera) were sent on a last attack against Port Sudan; all other ships, on Bonetti's orders, scuttled themselves to avoid being captured, part of them in the port of Massawa and the others in the Dahlak Islands. Bonetti arranged the scuttling of the ships in Massawa (nine Italian and five German merchant ships, the torpedo boats Giovanni Acerbi and Vincenzo Giordano Orsini , the minelayer Ostia , two gunboats three tugboats, as well as two floating docks and a floating crane) so that their wrecks would blockade the port entrances and render the harbour unusable for a long period. All ships were scuttled between April 1 and April 8, 1941. Bonetti was also the commander of the Massawa Fortress Area and its garrison, which numbered about 10,000 men; after the end of the Battle of Keren, this was the last Italian military presence in Eritrea, along with a few hundred men in the Assab naval base.I. O. S. Playfair, J. R. M. Butler, \\"The Mediterranean and Middle East: The Early Successes Against Italy (to May 1941)\\", pp. 441-442, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series. Massawa was encircled by Commonwealth forces on April 5, 1941; General Lewis Heath telephoned Bonetti and requested him to surrender and not to obstruct the port by scuttling ships, threatening otherwise to abandon the Italian civilian population in East Africa. Bonetti twice refused the ultimatum; on April 8, the 7th and 10th Indian Infantry Brigade simultaneously attacked Massawa, supported by tanks of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, Free French troops and the RAF, which bombed Italian artillery positions. While the attack of the 7th Indian Brigade was repelled, the 10th Indian Brigade and the tanks managed to penetrate the defenses on the western side, while the Gaullist forces broke through in the southwestern sector. Bonetti capitulated in the afternoon of April 8, after having as much equipment as possible dumped into the harbor. For his defense of Massawa, Bonetti was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Military Order of Italy and the Cross of Order of the German Eagle. He was sent to a POW camp in British India, and remained there until 1945. Repatriated after the war, Bonetti was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and placed in command of the Livorno Naval Academy; he was placed in auxiliary for age limits in October 1947. In 1956 he was promoted to admiral and transferred to the reserve. He died in Genoa 19 February 1961.

It was built about 1889 to serve as housing for workers in the area's granite quarries, and preserves a number of the utilitarian features that characterize these types of worker housing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history 143 Highland Avenue is located in a residential area north of the commercial center of Hardwick, on the south side of Highland Avenue between Daniels Road and Riverside Terrace. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is oriented to the east, facing its parking area. It is symmetrically arranged and five bays wide, with a modest center entrance sheltered by a shed-roof porch that extends between flanking polygonal bays. The roof above is pierced by two shed-roof single-window dormers. The gabled sides are four bays wide; with the basement exposed at the rear and left side due to the lot's sloping terrain. The interior houses mirror-image units on the first and second floors, with an additional unit in the attic space. The basic layout of the first and second floor units is historical, although accommodations have been made for plumbing (not present in the original construction) during rehabilitation of the structure. Period woodwork was retained during the rehabilitation as much as possible, and an ahistoric rear porch system was replaced by one more closely resembling that of early photographs. with This building was constructed about 1889, in order to address burgeoning demand for worker housing in the area's granite quarries and processing sheds. Unlike other industrial communities, Hardwick's businesses did not build company- owned housing to satisfy this demand, relying instead on local residents to provide housing. This tenement was apparently built by J.J. Campbell, who purchased the parcel and lived in a house across the street.

They were the largest vessels built in China until the 1930s; they each ran over budget and used sub-standard building materials which limited their use. Haian was initially used as a training ship, and later saw action in the Sino-French War as a potential blockship, being scrapped as a hulk following the war. Design Haian was the lead ship of the of wooden steam powered frigates. She was constructed at the dockyard at the Kiangnan Arsenal for the Imperial Chinese Navy's Nanyang Fleet. Haian and her sister ship were the largest vessels built in China until the cruiser in 1931. Haian was originally named Chen-an, and measured long overall, with a beam of and an average draft of . The propulsion system consisted of a reciprocating engine with a single shaft, enabling a cruising speed of . She was also equipped with a sailing rig across her three masts. She had a crew complement of 372. Her armament initially consisted of two muzzle-loading rifles (MLRs) mounted on the upper deck and 24 70-pounder Whitworth naval guns, the latter mounted in broadsides. During a later overhaul these were subsequently replaced Krupp guns of varying sizes, with two guns placed on the upper deck, and the broadside replaced with four and 20 guns. Haian was built at a cost of 355,190 taels; the cost of Haian and Yuyuen exceeded the budget and resulted in their limited use initially. Furthermore, due to the use of low quality pine from Oregon and Vancouver in the construction of the vessels meant that the timbers were showing obvious signs of rot after a few months of use. Career Haian was launched on 24 May 1872 from the Kiangnan Arsenal, ahead of her sister ship 19 months later. The cost of the two ships meant that Yuyuen was not initially manned as there was not sufficient funds remaining to pay for her crew. Meanwhile, Haian spent the majority of her early life as a training vessel. Both Haian-class frigates were known for being unseaworthy. During the Sino-French War, Haian was prepared to be used as a blockship should the French Navy attempt to attack Shanghai. She was filled with stones and towed out to the bar of the Whangpoo (now Huangpu) river. As this attack did not occur, she was towed back into Shanghai after the end of the war, and was disposed of as a hulk within a few years.

He served as Minister of Public Instruction from 1915–1926, and was the first President of the National Assembly, serving from 28 June – 1 September 1932 and from 15 December 1933 – 26 February 1934.http://oknation.nationtv.tv/blog/buzz/2017/01/16/entry-1 Personal life Sanan Devahastin na Ayudhya was born near the Hua Met Shrine, Saphan Shan District, Phra Nakhon Province, Bangkok, on 1 January 1876. When he was eight years old his father died and his life changed, although this misfortune proved providential in some ways to his future career as an educator, minister and key member of the court of King Rama VI. Despite being the son of a senior nobleman and a direct descendant of King Rama I, he helped mothers with gardening and trading, and was contracted to undertake buttonhole stitching from a young age. Through these enterprises, he learned to be hardworking, compassionate, and thrifty, and not to be discouraged by unforeseen drawbacks - all valuable lessons that enabled him to flourish in both his education and his later work as Minister of Public Instruction, a position similar to Minister of Education today. Following his marriage to Lady Tawin Salak, the young couple were given a grand new home as a wedding present by the bride's father, Phraya Sriphuripricha, in the Nang Loeng neighbourhood in Pomprap Sattruphai district, part of Bangkok's old town. The prominent, Western-style Neoclassical mansion is an architectural showpiece and important legacy of Bangkok's historical and cultural heritage. Built in 1899, it was commissioned, designed and constructed by the Italian architect, Mario Tamagno, designer of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, Neilson Hays Library and Hua Lamphong Railway Station. The impressive white house with green eaves on Nakhon Sawan Road, replete with imported white Italian marble, teak floors, delicate stucco designs and intricate patterns on the beams, arches and vents, reflects the esteemed Italian architect's style and the European influences of the time. Chaophraya Thammasakmontri's house, now owned by his descendants, recently reopened as an educational and cultural centre. Renamed 'Bangkok 1899', both the house and its gardens opened to the public in February 2019 to promote the arts, cultural exhibitions and the arts in education, with a focus on sustainability. By reopening the house to the public as an art-space-cum- civic-centre, the 'Bangkok 1899' project commemorates the life and work of Chaophraya Thammasakmontri, and continues his idea of using education as a means of social, national, cultural and individual development. Creative Migration, a non-profit international arts organization based in Los Angeles and Bangkok with major support from The Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Motor Company Fund, spearheaded the restoration. Education and Career Senan Devahastin Na Aydhaya studied at Wat Bophitphimuk School, Suankularb Wittayalai School and Sunanta School, followed by the Teacher Training School from 1892 - 1894, where he earned a teaching certificate and became one of the first graduates in the initial cohort of qualified schoolteachers in Thailand. He taught for approximately two years, and then on 4 May 1896, as a scholarship student with the Thai Ministry of Education, he left Thailand to continue his studies at Borough Road College in Isleworth, west London (later incorporated into Brunel University), under the direction of Sir Robert Laurie Morant. After his studies in Britain and following a three-month study tour of India and Myanmar, he returned to Thailand and established the Thai education system based on the British school system. He was awarded the title Chaophraya Thammasakmontri and became Lord Chamberlain in the King's Court. Known as the father of modern Thai education, Chaophraya Thammasakmontri laid the foundations of contemporary learning in the country and was one of the forward-thinking educators who helped found and build Chulalongkorn University, the country's first higher education institution. After resigning from government service, Chao Phraya Thammasakmontri collaborated with his eldest daughter, Chailai Thephasadin Na Ayudhaya, to convert his family home into Satree Chulanak School to promote education and provide scholarships for talented young students.

It was founded in 1170, and like the town whose creation was closely linked to the palace, goes back to Emperor Frederick I (Barbarossa). The palace enabled the expansion of imperial territory along an important long-distance highway, the Via Regia.  History  Inside face of the southern wall of the palas The exact date when construction of the palace began is still very much disputed by historians. Debate revolves around the question of whether the building of the palace took place a few years before the official founding of the royal town in 1170.For the question of the construction period see: Binding, Ehlers, Strickhausen, Zettler or whether there was even an earlier castle belonging to the .Joachim Ehlers: Zur Datierung der Pfalz Gelnhausen. Various data acquired through the use of dendrochronology point to the time around 1170, in which the subsoil was made capable of bearing load by driving oak piles into the ground for the foundations of the walls.Strickhausen, pp. 248ff. The construction of the palace was probably managed by the , who erected the castle of Büdingen as their own residence nearby. In 1180, the imperial palace at Gelnhausen was the venue for the great imperial court or Hoftag of Gelnhausen, at which Henry the Lion was put on trial in his absence and his imperial fiefs redistributed. In the years that followed, further imperial courts were convened at Gelnhausen. Whether at this time the now ruined palas had been built for use as an assembly hall is not clear, but appears likely. The large number of different stonemasons suggests a relatively large number of labourers working on the building site at the same time and thus a rapid pace of construction.Gottfried Kiesow: Die Kaiserpfalz. In: Bei der Burg Gelnhausen eine neue Stadt. Barbarossastadt Gelnhausen (publ.), 1995, . During the Hohenstaufen era, the palace was an Imperial Castle (Reichsburg), had a burgrave and Burgmannen. Its estate included , in which the castle's occupants still retained timber rights (for construction and firewood) until the 19th century. The decline of the palace began as early as the 14th century when, in 1349, Emperor Charles IV (HRR) enfeoffed it, together with the town, to the Counts of Schwarzburg and never reclaimed it. In 1431, the Count of Hanau and Count Palatine Louis III procured the palace and town from Count Henry of Schwarzburg. At the end of the 16th century, the Counts of Isenburg in Birstein had taken over the burgrave's office, but did not reside at the castle. During the Thirty Years' War, the town and palace were severely damaged and Imperial and Swedish troops razed down its main building. After the extinction of the House of Hanau in 1736, Gelnhausen fell to the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel. The palace was then used as a quarry until 1811. The castle chapel had to be partly demolished due to its dilapidated condition. Around 1810, the palace became one of the first buildings from the epoch of Romanesque architecture in Germany that attracted the interest of art-loving scholars.Hundeshagen, Bernhard: Kaiser Friedrichs I. Barbarossa Palast in der Burg zu Gelnhausen. Eine Urkunde vom Adel der von Hohenstaufen und der Kunstbildung ihrer Zeit, Mainz, 1819. At the end of the 19th century and during the 20th century, the first safety measures were carried out to preserve the remains of the palace for posterity. Likewise, it was not until the end of the 19th century that the previously independent municipality of Burg was dissolved and integrated into the town of Gelnhausen. Today Today, the palace belongs to the state of Hesse and is managed by the Administration of State Castles and Gardens for Hesse. Along with its attached castle museum, it is open to the public.

Biography Marianne Schmid Mast was born in Olten (Switzerland) and did her primary school in Däniken, Solothurn. When she was 10, her family moved to Oberkulm and she went to Bezirksschule Unterkulm and then to Handelsschule (Alte KantonSchule Aarau) in Aarau. After receiving her business diploma, she completed her Matura in economics at the École Supérieure de Commerce in Neuchâtel. She worked for a computer company for a year, and later on she spent half a year traveling in Brazil. She then started medical school at the University of Zurich to discover that her passion is in Psychology. This is when she started to study psychology at the University of Zurich. She was always interested in understanding the interpersonal interactions at work which led her to become a full professor of organizational behavior at the University of Lausanne. Marianne Schmid Mast is married and has two sons. The family lives in Pully. Academic career Marianne Schmid Mast received her Master in Psychology in 1996 and her Ph.D. in psychology in 2000, both from University of Zurich. She then continued her research at Northeastern University, Boston, USA, in the Social and Personality Psychology Area, working with Judith A. Hall. Back in Switzerland at the University of Zurich in Social and Health Psychology, she was appointed assistant professor in Social Psychology at the University of Fribourg. In 2006 she became a full professor of Personnel Psychology at the Department of Work and Organizational Psychology at the University of Neuchatel and she was appointed full professor of Organizational Behavior at the Faculty of Business and Economics, HEC, at the University of Lausanne, in August 2014. She currently is an associate editor of the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior and a member of the editorial board of the journal Leadership Quarterly. In 2018, she was nominated as one of the 50 most influential living psychologists worldwide and has been appointed a Fellow of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, as well as a Division 8 Fellow of the American Psychology Association (APA) for her extraordinary, distinctive and longstanding contributions to the science of personality and social psychology. Research Her research addresses how individuals in power hierarchies interact with others, how they perceive their social interaction partners, and how they communicate (verbally and nonverbally). Moreover, she studies how first impressions affect interpersonal interactions and evaluations and how people form accurate impressions of others. One aspect of her research is concerned with how physician communication affects patient outcomes. She uses immersive virtual environment technology to investigate interpersonal behavior and communication as well as computer-based automatic sensing to analyze nonverbal behavior in social interactions. Virtual reality Marianne Schmid Mast has created her immersive virtual reality laboratory when she was at the University of Neuchâtel in 2006. In 2014, the laboratory was moved with her to the Faculty of Business and Economics, HEC, at the University of Lausanne and is subsequently known under the name of Interpersonal Behavior Laboratory. She uses immersive virtual reality for the study of human social interaction behavior and for interpersonal skills training. Selected publications Muralidhar, S., Nguyen, L.

He served in the US Army Infantry during World War I where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Part of his training was conducted at Camp Greene in Charlotte. In 1925 Baxter returned to Charlotte and organized Central Lumber Company. He was president of the company until it closed in 1958. Baxter became interested in local politics in 1935. He was elected to the Charlotte City Council from 1935–1941, and 1951–1959. In 1943, he defeated E McAurther Currie to become Charlotte's mayor. He was reelected in 1945 and 1947. During his terms as mayor, Baxter established a planning board and called for progressive city growth. He launched a sale of bonds to finance the cities Program for Progress. During his administration the city acquired Morris Field from the US Air Force which would be used for airport expansion, developed and adopted heath, housing, and zoning ordinances, created ABC legislation, began the construction of a cross town highway, established a city employee retirement system and created the department of Traffic Engineering. In 1949 he was defeated by Victor Shaw. After his term as mayor, Baxter continued to work with the city, primarily as vice chair of the Charlotte Redevelopment Commission. Baxter was also active in community organizations including the Masons, Lions Club, Myers Park Country Club, Charlotte Mecklenburg Boy Scouts, and Charlotte Symphony Orchestra. he helped found the Charlotte City Club in 1947 and served as its first president. He served as commander of the Civil Air Patrol's North Carolina Wing from 1950–1953. Baxter died in 1967.

He was one of those who were condemned for heresy and insubordination for their devotion to the ideal of poverty first promulgated by Saint Francis – others included the Tramondo brothers, Thomas of Tolentino and Pietro da Macerata.Angelo Clareno, Liber chronicarum, ed. 1999 V, pp. 308 f. However, they were then freed by Raymond Gaufridi, general minister, who sent them on a mission to Lesser Armenia after a request for some monks from Hethum II, King of Armenia. He and Thomas were the two brothers chosen by Hethum towards the end of 1291 as envoys to Pope Nicholas IV, Philip V of France and Edward I of England to request aid against the Saracen advance. They first went to the pope, who gave them special letters for each of the two kings, then to Philip. They arrived in Paris whilst the general chapter of the Franciscans was in session and on 25 May 1292 the letter from Hethum was read out.

It keeps the shaded area cooler and allows a person to avoid squinting in the bright sunlight. Like a folding umbrella, the JWST sunshield will be expanded after it is in space, but is folded up during launch. Sunshield is a component of the James Webb Space Telescope, designed to shield the main optics from the Sun's heat and light. This is part of a space telescope and it extends out unfolding a large metal-coated sheet of material post-launch. This material blocks the Sun's light and heat, so the telescope can see the faint light coming from stars and galaxies. The sunshield segment includes the layers and its deployment mechanisms, which also includes the trim flap.The Webb Update #5 – September 2008. The layers of the sunshield provide an insulating layer for the optics and help dissipate heat. The shield has five layers and, each layer is roughly the size of a tennis court. Each layer is as thin as a human hair and is coated with aluminum for reflectivity. The purple color of some layers comes from the material silicon, the same material in most computer chips, which toughens the shield and which helps it reflect heat. The telescope uses the sunshield to stop itself from being warmed by infrared radiation from the Sun and other nearby planetary objects, which would otherwise inhibit normal operations of onboard instruments. The purple-magenta hue of the sun-facing side of Sunshield, originates from silicon doped aluminum coating on the outermost kapton membrane. Overview The sunshield acts as large parasol allowing the main mirror, optics, and instruments to passively cool to or lower. It consists of layers of Kapton and is big enough to shade the main mirror and secondary mirror, leaving only one instrument, the MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), in need of extra cooling. The sunshield has five layers to mitigate the conduction of heat, and the layers also have a special coating to radiate and reflect heat into space. The first layer is thick, and the other layers are thick. The kite-shaped sunshield about is 22 meters by 10 meters in size. In operation it will receive about 300 kilowatts of solar radiation, but only pass 23 milliwatts to the other side. It is a V-groove radiator and causes a temperature drop of 300 kelvins () from front to back. The telescope needs to be colder than the objects it is attempting to observe. It needs to be cold enough that its internal infrared emissions are significantly less than the observed objects at the relevant wavelengths. The sunshield is a critical part of the telescope to achieve temperatures low enough for the sensitive infrared observations it is planning to make. The sunshield membrane is one of the enabling technologies that will allow the JWST to operate. To make observations in the near and mid infrared spectrum, the JWST must be kept very cold (under ), otherwise infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments. Therefore, it uses a large sunshield to block light and heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and its position near the Earth–Sun point keeps all three bodies on the same side of the spacecraft at all times. Its halo orbit around avoids the shadow of the Earth and Moon, maintaining a constant environment for the sunshield and solar arrays. The sunshield is made of the polyimide film Kapton, which is stable at very low temperatures. The core material of the sunshield is the material Kapton coated with aluminum, and the two closest layers to the Sun are also doped with silicon. This helps the material survive in space, radiate excess heat, and they are also designed to conduct electricity so a charge does not build up on the layers. The silicon-doped aluminum layer is 50 nanometers (nm) thick. A 100 nm thick aluminum coating is applied to the front and back of all five layers. The core Kapton layer on the first layer is an extra thick, and the rest are in thickness. Kapton is noted for being stable from -269 to 400 Celsius (-452 to plus 752 degrees Fahrenheit). However, in the long term even stored on Earth, Kapton used on the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount had degraded after 40 years. The layers are designed with Thermal Spot Bond (TSB), which helps stop a rip or hole from increasing in size should one occur. There is a grid pattern bonded to each layer at intervals. Each layer has a slightly different shape and size. The layer (level 5) is the closest to the primary mirror and is the smallest. The layer closest to the Sun is called Layer 1 and is bigger and more curved. The first layer blocks 90% of the heat, and each successive layer blocks more heat, which is vented out the sides. The sunshield allows the optics to stay in shadow for pitch angles of +5° to −45° and roll angles of +5° to −5°. The sunshield is designed to be folded twelve times so it will fit within the Ariane 5 rocket's shroud. Once deployed at the L2 point, it will unfold to . The sunshield was hand-assembled at ManTech (NeXolve) in Huntsville, Alabama before it was delivered to Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California for testing.Morring, Jr., Frank, Sunshield, Aviation Week and Space Technology, December 16, 2013, pp. 48–49. During launch it is wrapped around the Optical Telescope Element and then later is unfolded. The sunshield is planned to be unfolded two days after launch. Deployment The sunshield component attaches to the main spacecraft, and its booms expand outward spreading out the head shield and separating the layers. During launch the whole thing is folded up, then later when its in space is carefully unfurled. Sunshield deployment structure/devices * telescoping booms ** stem deployers * spreader bars * cable drives There are two stem deployers inside the telescoping booms. These are special electrical motors that, when operated, extended the telescopic boom, pulling out the folded sunshield.. The telescopic booms are called the MBA, or mid-boom assemblies. At the end of each MBA is a spreader bar. Components: * Core * Front and Aft four-bar linkage * Aft structure assembly ** Momentum Trim Tab (the tab is attached to the aft structure assembly) ** Aft spreader bars (spreads layers in the rear) * Forward structure assembly ** Forward spreader bars * Mid-Booms (one on each side) ** Mid-spreader bars (spreads the 5 layers apart) * Two forward and Two aft Bipod launch lock assemblies The Bipod launch lock assemblies are where the Sunshield segment connects to the OTE while it is folded up during launch. There are six spreader bars that expand to separate the layers of the sunshield, which has roughly six sides. When the sunshield is fully spread open, it is 14.6 meters wide and 21.1 meters long. When the layers are fully open, they are opened wider at the edges which helps reflect heat out. Trim flap/momentum trim tab The sunshield segment also includes that trim flap at the end of a sunshield deployment boom. This is also called the momentum trim tab. The trim tab helps balance out solar pressure. The trim tab also manages the effects of the reaction wheels. The reaction wheels are located in the Spacecraft Bus (JWST) The trim flap reduces the amount of fuel needed, because the spacecraft does not have to balance out the force from solar pressure. Layers The five layers of the JWST Sunshield being tested in 2013 Coupons of Sunshield test fabric being tested to see how they perform, 2012 In this artists view, a stylized portrayal of the orientation of the telescope, shows how the Sunshield blocks sunlight from heating the main mirror (not to scale) The layer nearest to Primary mirror, L5 is the only one with a line of sight to it, while the l5 layer closest to the Sun, is the only one that receives direct sunlight. The separation between layers, in the vacuum of space, prevents heat transfer by conduction and aids in radiating heat out of the way. The silicon-doping is what causes the purple hue of the areas covered with that material. The layers are designed so the Sun, Earth, and Moon shine on layer 1 almost exclusively, sometimes a tiny portion of layer 2, and on the other side that the telescope elements only see Layer 5 and sometimes a tiny amount of Layer 4. Layers: * Layer 1 ** 0.05 millimeters (0.002 inches) ** 100 nm (3.93 microinches) aluminum coating (Both sides) ** 50 nanometers (nm) (1.9 microinches) silicon-doped aluminum ** Biggest area layer * Layer 2 ** 0.025 mm (0.001 inches) ** 100 nm (3.93 microinches) aluminum coating (Both sides) ** 50 nanometers (nm) (1.9 microinches) silicon-doped aluminum * Layer 3 ** 0.025 mm (0.001 inches) ** 100 nm (3.93 microinches) aluminum coating (Both sides) * Layer 4 ** 0.025 mm (0.001 inches) ** 100 nm (3.93 microinches) aluminum coating (Both sides) * Layer 5 ** 0.025 mm (0.001 inches) ** 100 nm (3.93 microinches) aluminum coating (Both sides) ** Smallest area layer During development the Sunshield layer material was tested with heat, cold, radiation, and high-velocity micro impacts.

He was sent with Angelo Clareno and four other monks by Raymond Gaufridi sometime after 1289. However, the hostility of the \\"fratres communes\\" forced Pietro da Macerata and Clareno to return to Italy, where they were refused by every abbey they approached. They met pope Celestine V at L'Aquila - he split them from the Franciscans and set up a new order of \\"pauperes Eremitae\\" (poor hermits), to be resident in Celestine monasteries. Pietro then changed his name to \\"Fra Liberato\\" The formation of the new order drew a hostile reaction from the \\"fratres communes\\", who even tried to kidnap Fra Liberato. After Celestine V's abdication, it was vulnerable and moved to Thessaly around 1298. Pope Boniface VIII remained hostile to it despite two embassies by Fra Liberato himself. Fra Liberato thus decided to return to Italy permanently to defend the order before pope Benedict XI. However, the inquisitor Tomaso d'Aversa ordered his arrest and Fra Liberato was only able to escape him by retreating to the hermitage of San Angelo della Versa, where he died.

Location Athenry Castle is located off Court Lane in the east part of Athenry, on the west bank of the River Clarin. It is sited on a natural rise and defended the ford. History Despite being locally known as King John's Castle or King John's Court (after the Lord of Ireland 1177–1216), it wasn't built until twenty years after his reign. The original keep (constructed 1235/40) was low and squat, the roof being at the level of the present second floor. Meyler de Bermingham extended it c. 1250. In 1316 the castle was attacked, leading to the construction of city walls. In the 15th century the Berminghams moved from it to their town house near the market cross in the square. In 1596 (during the Nine Years' War) the castle fell into the hands of the O'Donnells. The battlements are 13th century and in the 15th century, these parapets were incorporated into gables for a new roof. The castle was restored in 2005. Building Another view Athenry Castle is a large rectangular building with base-batter, originally containing only a hall on the upper level and storerooms at ground level. The battlements are 13th century with tall arrowslits in the merlons. In the 15th century, these parapets were incorporated into gables at the north and south ends for a new roof. Parts of the original enclosure wall of the castle survive. The original entrance was at first-floor level and was reached by an external wooden stairs. Heat was probably provided by a brazier in the centre of the hall, with the smoke exiting through a louver or opening in the roof directly above. The garderobe is diagonally across from the main entrance. There is fine carving on the exterior of the doorway and on the inner side of two of the window openings. The capitals are carved with floral motifs in a local style, known as the \\"School of the West\\", transitional between Romanesque and Late Gothic. A mural staircase led to the top floor. Wall-towers were built at the northeast and southeast corners, while the southwest corner was fortified by the gate. In fiction The castle features in the 2005 children's historical novel: Hoofbeats: Lara at Athenry Castle by Kathleen Duey.

It was related to an extended period of campaign violence before the fall gubernatorial election, as white Democrats in the state used racial terrorism to suppress black Republican voting. White Klan members attacked a Republican rally of 2,000 black citizens in the courthouse square, killing as many as four and wounding 54. Black Republicans feared for their safety, staying away from the polls or voting Democratic. The Democratic Party won the 1870 gubernatorial election, as similar intimidation was conducted against blacks in other heavily majority Republican counties. Background and violence Old Greene County Courthouse in Eutaw, Alabama As in other states of the former Confederacy, Alabama citizens had been terrorized frequently by the Ku Klux Klan in the run-up to the 1870 gubernatorial election:Hennessey; summarized in Lincove 270. in Calhoun County, four blacks and one white had been lynched in July 1870. In Greene County, Gilford Coleman, a black Republican leader, had been lynched, fatally shot and his body mutilated, after being taken from his own house. His was the first of two political assassinations of black men in the county in the summer and fall. Earlier in the year, on the night of March 31, 1870, James Martin, a black Republican from Union, Alabama was killed, as was white Republican County Solicitor Alexander Boyd, shot in his hotel in Eutaw, the county seat, by members of a 30-member, masked and costumed lynching party who rode into town on horseback. No one was prosecuted for either death, and state attempts to end violence in Greene County stopped after Boyd's murder.Waldrep 143 On October 25, a Republican political rally was held at the county courthouse in Eutaw, attracting 2,000 blacks. The rally was attacked by Klansmen (supporting Democrats), who first verbally harassed the attendees and then started shooting;Waldrep 137. they left two to four blacks dead and 54 people injured. Federal troops in the area did not intervene that day. Black voters stayed away from the polls on election day in fear of more violence, contributing to Democratic electoral success for the governorship.Hennessey; summarized in Lincove 270. In the 1868 presidential election, Greene County had voted for Republican Ulysses S. Grant by a margin of 2,000 votes; in the 1870 gubernatorial election, voters carried Democrat Robert B. Lindsay by a margin of 43 votes. Legal aftermath After the riot, local man Samuel B. Brown, likely a low-ranking Republican politician, appeared before U.S. Circuit Court Judge William Woods. His testimony resulted in a complaint charging fourteen whites with violating the First Amendment, and white Democrats with violating the Constitutional rights of Brown and six others by the Eutaw attack.Waldrep 137–38. Election day was calm in Eutaw. Black voters, intimidated and fearful, stayed home or voted Democratic. While state officials took no action (besides arresting some of the black victims of the riot), the U.S. Commissioner in Demopolis issued arrest warrants, and $4000 bonds to ensure the defendants appeared in court. A federal grand jury indicted twenty of the rioters on December 24, 1870, while Woods was awaiting a response to a letter he sent to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley, inquiring whether federal law, particularly the Enforcement Act of 1870, was applicable to these events. Bradley responded in January 1871, indicating he understood the real question: whether the rioters had violated the victims' constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments protected individuals against the state, but in Eutaw, private individuals, not the state, had violated citizens' rights.Waldrep 138–40. The matter was considered especially pressing as some Southern states had been readmitted to the Union. But despite passage of the Enforcement Acts in May 1870 to end Klan violence, Democratic politicians and their supporters in those states continued with violent suppression of the black (Republican) vote, resulting in significant Republican losses in the U.S. Congress. These events strengthened Bradley in his resolve to defeat violent white Southerners by legal means.Waldrep 140–41. United States Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, a former Confederate and slaveholder who became one of the Klan's most outspoken enemies, directed prosecution of the case. In the end, federal prosecutors failed to gain a conviction in United States v. Hall, which was against one of the white defendants, as the court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment was limited to acts by the state. Bradley was eventually swayed by Miller, and backed away from application of the 14th Amendment to protecting natural rights of individuals.Waldrep 148-151. If US v. Hall had been decided in favor of the government, it has been argued, the case could have set an important precedent for the protection of African Americans under the Fourteenth Amendment.Clauson iii.

Smith's audiobook recording of M Train earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Spoken Word Album. Publication Smith published M Train in 2015 with Alfred A. Knopf. Contents M Train is Smith's second memoir, following the 2010 National Book Award-winning Just Kids. While Just Kids recounts Smith's early life, the beginning of her career and particularly her relationship with artist Robert Mapplethorpe, M Train focuses on a later portion of her life, the period since the release of her debut album Horses in 1975. The memoir particularly recounts the personal losses that marked the forty-year span between Horses and M Train, including the deaths of Mapplethorpe in 1989, of AIDS; Smith's husband, guitarist Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith, in 1994 at 45, of heart failure; and Smith's brother Todd a month later, of a stroke. The book also discusses the 16 years in this period during which Smith was not performing; instead, living in Detroit with her husband and two children, she spent early mornings writing stories before her family awoke. The title, M Train, referring to this imaginative work, invokes a \\"mind train\\" that \\"goes to any station it wants.\\" Reception M Train received strongly favorable reviews.

It is administered by the state, and protects a large area of Atlantic Forest. It is associated with the Paranapiacaba Ecological Corridor of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve. Formation In 1995 the area covered by Paranapiacaba Mosaic was declared part of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and in 2000 it was declared a natural World Heritage Site. The TCCA/FF Paranapiacaba Mosaic Project was approved by the Environmental Compensation Chamber and launched in September 2011 to define the scope, schedule, synergies and integrated management of the mosaic. During the June 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) the Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park was created with of Atlantic Forest covering the sources of the Paranapanema River. The new park and other units would make up the Paranapiacaba Conservation Unit Mosaic, a forest massif of over . São Paulo state decree 58.148 of 21 June 2012 created the Nascentes do Paranapanema state park and the Paranapiacaba Conservation Units Mosaic. The mosaic consisted of the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park, Intervales State Park, Carlos Botelho State Park, Xitué Ecological Station, Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park and the Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area in the municipalities of Eldorado, Sete Barras, Tapiraí, Juquiá, Ribeirão Grande and Capão Bonito. The purpose was to promote integrated and participatory management of the conservation units, and to seek to guarantee conservation of the areas covered. Additional units could be later added to the mosaic by decree. The Secretariat for the Environment had 180 days to constitute the mosaic, and was to provide the material, human and financial resources needed. Extent As of 2016 the Serra de Paranapiacaba Mosaic has over and contains the largest remaining area of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. The Intervales State Park forms the central region of the mosaic. Other conservation units in the mosaic are the Carlos Botelho, Alto Ribeira Tourist, Nascentes do Paranapanema and Caverna do Diabo state parks, Xitué Ecological Station, Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area and Quilombos do Médio Ribeira Environmental Protection Area. The forest of the Nascentes do Paranapanema park is extremely well preserved, and is home to the largest population of jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Atlantic Forest. It includes other threatened species such as cougar (Puma concolor), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), pygmy brocket (Mazama nana) and southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides). The connection between the various areas in the Paranapiacaba mosaic will help the species to survive. The jaguar tends to avoid areas frequented by man, including areas used by hunters and gatherers of heart of palm. It is estimated that there are just 250 individual jaguars in the states of Paraná, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, most of them in the mosaic area. Paranapiacaba ecological continuum Ecological corridor The Paranapiacaba Ecological Corridor, also called the Paranapiacaba Continuum, is part of the Tombamento da Serra do Mar, established by resolution CONDEPHAAT 40/1995, and the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve, created by UNESCO in 1991 and recognized in 1999 as a World Heritage Site. As of 2012 the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve (RBMA) \\"Sources, Caves and Ecotones\\" project aimed to create and expand conservation units in the Paranapiacaba Ecological Corridor, a unique area for biodiversity conservation, with the largest remaining fragment of Atlantic Forest. The corridor is composed of the Carlos Botelho, Intervales and Alto Ribeira Tourist state parks, the Xitué Ecological Station and the Serra do Mar and Quilombos do Meio Ribeira environmental protection areas.

In an effort to explain where Cain and Abel acquired wives, some traditional sources stated that each child of Adam and Eve was born with a twin who became their mate. According to the Seder HaDorot, the wife and twin sister of Cain was named Kalmana, and the wife and twin of Abel was Balbira.

The poet Petrus Riga (1140–1209) included Calmana in his famous poem Aurora, and this could have been a source for her appearance in Peter Comestor's Historia Scholastica. Comestor's Biblical narrative text then served as the standard textbook for Biblical education for centuries. Luluwa Religious sources also describe Aclima's name as Luluwa. Luluwa, the sister-wife of Abel, is described as the most beautiful of the early daughters of Adam and Eve. However, Cain reportedly hated her whilst in Eve's womb with her.

The Second Decemvirate was made up of just as many plebeians, like Quintus Poetelius, as it was by patricians. At the instigation of Appius Claudius, the decemvirs held on to power the following year and refused to allow the annual election of consuls in 449 BC.Cicero, De Republica, II. 61 In 449 BC, a war escalated with the Sabines who established themselves in Eretum and the Aequi who had camped on Mount Algidus. Roman forces were divided into two armies in order to fight on two fronts. Quintus Poetelius received command of the army which fought the Sabines, with three other decemvirs: Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Manius Rabuleius, and Kaeso Duillius. At the time, Appius Claudius and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome in order to ensure the defence of the city, while the other four decemvirs fought against the Aequi.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 38-42Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI. 2 The two Roman armies were each kept in check on both fronts. The army commanded by Quintus Poetelius withdrew to Fidenae and Crustumerium then returned to the field after the death of Lucius Siccius Dentatus, former tribune of the plebs and staunch opponent of the patricians. His death was concealed as though it were a loss suffered in an ambush. The soldiers then mutinied and elected ten military tribunes to command the army. They returned to Rome and camped on the Aventine before merging with the other army on Monte Sacro. Under pressure from the soldiers and the plebeians, the decemvirs resigned. Appius Claudius Crassus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome and were imprisoned, but committed suicide during their trial.

These mites complete their development on a single host, sucking all of its body content and therefore killing it. This is the ninth species of Macrodinychus reported as ant parasite, and the third known as parasitoid of invasive ants, confirming a unique habit in the evolution of mite feeding strategies and suggesting that the entire genus might be parasitic on ants.  Morphology  M. multispinosus larva measure to be approximately 174.2 micrometers (lengthwise) by 104 micrometers(width) in size. They possess long legs approximate to body size, and can make up 48.3% of their body length. In protonymph stage, loss of function in the legs is due to the feeding stage, where they remain immobile. Protonymphs have been measured to be approximately 480 micrometers by 350 micrometers in body size. When the mites reach deutonymph stage, or adult stage, the body length differentiates greatly between male and female mites. Adult males can have a body length up to 830 micrometers, while adult females will be at a maximum length of 540 micrometers. Left: ventral view of a female; right: ventral view of a male. The species is dioecious, and differentiation will begin to show in the adult stage. The sexual dimorphism is distinguished by the size of the genital plate, which is larger and more ovular in females. Dorsal view of M. multispinosus larva  Life Cycle  The life cycle of M. multispinosus is similar to that of Macrodinychus sellnicki. There are three developmental stages: larval stage, protonymph stage, and deutonymph stage. During the larval stage, the mite is responsible for searching for its host P. longicornis pupa. The protonymph and deutonymph stages are two feeding stages, where they remain immobile. As a parasitoid, the M. multispinosus larva will remain attached to the ant pupa until adult stage of development, which is usually where the ant pupa will die. The life cycle, on average, lasts for about 30 days from larva to adult. Females will form 7 days after copulation and the larvae will form 37 days later.  Attachment  Attachment onto the host occurs during the mite's larval stage. Compared to other species within the genus, the larva will attach to the underside of the host pupa's head capsule. One of the most popular hosts for the M. multispinosus is the longhorn crazy ant.  Hosts  The M. multispinosus is most known for its trait of attaching onto longhorn crazy ants. Once it has attached onto the ants pupa it begins to drain the ant of its haemolymph. The haemolymph is the roughly equivalent of a humans blood. It is the fluid that flows through the ant. M. multispinosus doesn't just suck the ants internal fluids, but also begins to consume the internal tissue within the ant's pupa. The host ants that are sought out by M. multispinosusare the worker ants. This is due to making sure the reproductive portions of the ant colonies are unaffected so the number of hosts for the parasite to infect is always growing. Regardless, the infection and death of worker ants by M. multispinosuscan prove deadly for ant colonies if the parasite is present in large numbers.

Marge Hurlburt (Dec. 30, 1914 – July 4, 1947) was an American aviator who flew with the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) during World War II and set a women's international air speed record in 1947. Biography Margaret M. \\"Marge\\" Hurlburt was born and lived in Painesville, Ohio. She graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1938 and went on to teach school in Ohio. In the early 1940s, she took up flying at the airport in Willoughby, Ohio. The pioneering aviator Jacqueline Cochran recruited her into the Womens Air Service Pilots (WASP) in 1943. Between 1943 and 1945, she ferried aircraft around the country and towed targets for gunners, flying C-60s, B-24s, and B-17s. After the war, she obtained her rating as a flight instructor and worked at the Willoughby airfield, where she began learning aerobatics in the AT-6 aircraft. Not long afterwards, she won the top prize at the women's Halle Trophy Race at the Cleveland Air Races. In 1947, Hurlburt set a new international women's flight-speed record of 337 miles per hour, besting the previous women's record of 292.27 mph set by Cochran a decade earlier. She set the record in a loaned FG-1 Corsair. Following her record-setting flight, the media dubbed her \\"Queen of the Air\\". During this period, she served on the board of directors of the Professional Race Pilots Association, representing the interests of female pilots. That same year, she joined the Flying Tigers aerial circus to raise money for a midget racer she was designing known as the \\"Hurlburt Hurricane\\". Only a few days later, she was taking part in an air show at Decorah, Iowa, in a borrowed AT-6, when her aircraft crashed during a slow roll, killing her instantly. The International Woman's Air & Space Museum holds some artifacts from her life.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Bridge 6. Description and history The Railroad Street Bridge is located south of the town center of Johnson, providing access across the Lamoille River to rural areas south of the village, and historically to a railroad line (now the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. The bridge is a single-span Pratt through truss, with a clear span of and a width of , and rests on concrete abutments. A sidewalk about wide is cantilevered outside the upstream truss. The bridge deck is concrete laid over deck plating on I-beam stringers. with The bridge was built in 1928, its trusses fabricated by the Bethlehem Steel Company. It is one of the state's few surviving Pratt through trusses, and is unusually wide for bridges built after the state's devastating 1927 floods. Bridges have been documented at this site since 1859, although the crossing became important to the community after the railroad service arrived in 1876, and resulted in the creation of a small industrial area near the railroad. The bridge washed away in 1927 was a covered bridge of uncertain construction date. The present bridge was rehabilitated in 2006.

In 2008 “The North East New Development Areas Planning and Engineering Study” (NENT NDAs Study) began; it continued until 2013.[3] There were four primary objectives: determine strategic roles of the NDAs, build people-oriented communities, create sustainable living environments, and develop appropriate implementation mechanisms.[4] Industries such as special industries, research & development, creative industry, business, education, and medical care were emphasized in the developmental project.[5] The project was controversial with opponents questioning the need and intention of the project, zoning areas, compensation, and environmental preservation[6]. The latest revision of NENT was passed by the Executive Council in 2013[7] and was passed by the Legislative Council for Budget approval in 2014.[8]  Policy content  Kwu Tung North and Fanling North are planned to provide 60,700 new flats accommodating 174,900 people with a ratio of public to private housing of 60:40. A population of 460,000 can be contained until the planning's completion.[9] Due to its distance from central Hong Kong, the government concentrates residences, workplaces, and public facilities within 500 m of the public transport nodes, railway stations, and highways. An integrated pedestrian and cycle track network will serve to increase traffic convenience. A ‘Commercial, Research and Development Cluster’ will be developed to create synergy with Lok Ma Chau Loop, and it is estimated that there will be 37,700 job opportunities created.[10] The areas are designed to be environmentally friendly with the use of green building design and electric vehicles encouraged.[11]In long-term consideration, Long Valley will be preserved as a nature park to compensate for the wetland loss due to the NDAs. Two pieces of land located at the north and south of the Park are reserved for agricultural purposes for farmers to purchase or rent.[12] A special ex gratia compensation has been devised for affected qualified households to assist their removal. A public rental-housing site is reserved for rehousing.[13]  Timeline of development  = 1998 - 2003 = NENT Study was conducted in between 1998 and 2003 to assess its development potential for strategic growth.[14]Ping Che/Ta Kwu Ling, FLN, and KTN were identified as suitable NDAs.[15] The NDA proposals were shelved when population growth slowed and housing demand fell.[16] = 2007-2008 = NENT NDAs development was proposed in 2007-2008 Policy Address. This plan targeted the integration with the Pearl River Delta's development and the generation of employment opportunities in the Six Industries.[17] In June 2008, PlanD and CEDD worked on NENT NDAs Planning and Engineering Study which involved three-stage public engagement:[18] Stage One Public Engagement (\\"PE1\\"), [19] Stage Two Public Engagement (\\"PE2\\")[20]and Stage Three Public Engagement (\\"PE3\\").[21] The study's findings were publicized through newspapers advertisements, posters, invitation letters and a study website.[22] = November 2008 to February 2009 = PE1 consisted of 16 briefing sessions and a community workshop.[23]The public were engaged in focus group discussions on four topics: implementation mechanisms, people- oriented communities, strategic roles of NENT NDAs, and sustainable living environment.[24] In November 2008, briefing sessions were arranged with the Town Planning Board (TPB), the Development Panel of the Legislative Council, and the Planning Sub-committee of Land and Building Advisory Committee (LDAC).[25] Briefings on NENT NDAs proposal were delivered at the Joint Co- operation Meeting between the Planning Department, Shenzhen Municipal Planning Bureau, and 12th Beijing – Hong Kong Economic Co-operation Symposium.[26]Briefing sessions were also arranged for the Hong Kong Institute of Planners, the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong, Heung Yee Kuk New Territories (Heung Yee Kuk), and the Advisory Council on the Environment (ACE) in December 2008 and January 2009.[27] Upon invitations, the study team attended meetings held by North District Council (“NDC”) and RCs in four districts including Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ta Kwu Ling, and Sha Tau Kok.[28] The study team met residents and concerned groups from the Kwu Tung area and Fanling North Area including Ling Shan, Tin Ping Shan Tsuen, Ma Shi Po, and Shek Wu San. A 3-hour community workshop for the public was organized by PlanD and CEDD at Luen Wo Hui Community Hall in Fanling on December 20, 2008.[29] Expert Panel Members introduced four focus topics of the NDA's study before allowing group discussions of the topics.[30] Approximately 200 people attended the workshop. Many of the attendees were local residents, members of NDC, RCs, and representatives from relevant organizations like PlanD, Ma Shi Po Environmental Concern Group, and Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong.[31] Over 90 individual written comments were collected until March 2009. A general support for ecological conservation was found from the feedback.[32] = Mid-November 2009 - mid-January 2010 = PE2 involved 17 briefing sessions and 1 public forum for soliciting opinions on the Preliminary Outline Development Plans.[33]Some exhibition panels were set up to introduce the study.[34] Local committees and professional organizations met with the Green Group representatives and North District Secondary School Principals who gathered their opinions.[35] There were 4 local meetings with over 300 villagers held on November 29, 2009 and January 23, 2010.[36] These participants came from Kwu Tung Village, Fu Tei Au Village, Ling Shan Tsuen, Shek Wu San Tsuen, Tin Ping Shan Tsuen and Ma Shi Po.[37] On December 12, 2009, a public forum was organised to obtain public opinions on proposals at Luen Wo Hui Community Hall.[38] About 500 people attended the forum including local residents, relevant NDC and RC Members, and representatives from relevant parties and organisations.[39] The study team received more than 250 written comments until March 2010.[40]The development proposals were refined after taking into account the public comments and recommendations on technical assessments obtained from PE1 and PE2.[41] = Mid-June and September 2012 = PE3 was launched to gauge public opinion on the Recommended Outline Development Plans.[42]Roving exhibitions were organized at North Point, Sha Tin and the North District Government Offices.[43]Engagement activities included 35 briefing sessions, 1 public meeting, and 1 public forum. The study team remained work closely with aforementioned agencies, Housing Authority, relevant local committees, professional bodies, and other stakeholders such as green groups.[44] On July 29, 2012, a public meeting which 600 people participated in was held in Kwun Tung North.[45] A public forum organized on September 22, 2012 was also attended by more than 5,000 people.[46] On December 9, approximately 100 local residents opposed the plan and marched to Henderson Land's headquarter[47]. Over 10,000 written comments were received by the end of 2012. [48] = October 2012 - 6 October 2014 = After completion of the study in July 2013, NENT NDAs proposal was restated in the 2013 Policy Address.[49]On May 2, 2014, a motion allocating $340.8 million for advancing infrastructure work at KTN FLN NDAs was proposed.[50] Affected residents and activists stormed the Legislative Council building over the plan while pan-democrats filibustered over the bill.[51]On June 27, the motion was passed in Legislative Council[52]when most pan-democrats did not cast their votes.[53]The final report of the study was released in July 2014[54] and the government launched a new website for KTN FLN NDAs on October 6, 2014.[55]  Opinion  = Approbation =  Increase housing supply  The expansion of new towns, supported by the pro-Establishment, will provide a large number of housing to solve the growing housing problem, which severely affects the quality of life in Hong Kong, slowing down economic progress and development. [56] The plan will shorten the waiting time for public rental housing, which currently stands at 4.1 years. [57] =Improve the areas’ living environment= Helps to resolve the problems brought by industrial land and open warehouses to improve life quality of local residents. In addition, rehousing moves squatting inhabitants to public housing.[58]  Economic development  The ‘Commercial, Research and Development Cluster’ acts as a driving economic force in the areas; it creates job opportunities to local residents. The plan facilitates the interaction between Hong Kong and Shenzhen in cultural and economic aspects which bring strategic interest to Hong Kong.[59]  Create a sustainable, environmentally-friendly community  Cleans up current polluted lands and preserve Long Valley in the long run. = Criticisms =  Undemocratic policy-making process  During the initial stage of consultation, the government only invited Heung Yee Kok, registered organizations, and government-affiliated committees to the meetings. The local residents and the general public were not represented.[60] The government later organized forums, but those only serve to present the policy proposal and there was no deliberation or negotiation between the government and attendees.[61] Responding to this, fifty thousand submissions opposed to the policy were submitted to Town Planning Board (TPB)[62] and many protests followed. In spite of strong opposition, the government bypassed the TPB to apply for an appropriation to Financial Committee, Legislative Council (LegCo). This incited the protesters to storm LegCo complex.[63] In view of this, the government was being criticized of having pre-install options and making false public consultations.  Destroy local agriculture and natural environment  Civil society organizations (CSOs) claim that the planning will destroy one fourth of active farmlands. CSOs opposed full urbanization of the areas since the government does not formulate a policy concerns with sustainable development of rural areas.[64]  Collusion, transfer of benefits between government and the business sector  Open audition for land selling was replaced by ‘In-situ land exchange’ Policy. Those who own 4000m2 of land can apply for land exchange. The policy benefits real estate developers as they have already reserved a lot of agricultural land in the areas. Under this policy, they can change the use of land from agricultural to residential use by paying land premium instead of bidding the lands with high price. In term of this, the public criticized the planning paves the way for developers to build luxury apartments instead of building public housing.[65]  Paves the way to 'China-HK Integration’  The planning suggests the areas utilize their geographical advantages to have more interactions with Shenzhen. Then Chief Executive, C.Y. Leung has made remarks on the planning during his Chief Executive Election campaign; he suggested developing the areas into a 'special administrative region' in Hong Kong which would be visa- free to Mainland visitors. Opposition leaders in the Legislative Council have claimed that this will affect the sovereignty of Hong Kong; however, the pro- Establishment camp has expressed that the 'visa-free zone' will boost the retail and tourism industry of the Northern New Territories, bringing positive economic benefits. [66]There is still some opposition to this, but the government will consider this plan for the betterment and progress of Hong Kong while upholding the rule of law outlined in the constitutional document, the Basic Law. [67]  Subsequent development  The Advance Works, including site formation and infrastructure work, will commence in 2018. The first batch of resident intake is expected in 2023.[68] Modification of lease like in-situ land exchange will facilitate the first population intake in 2022. Completion of all construction works in KTN and FLN NDAs is designated in 2031.[69] References [1] Civil Engineering and Development Department, & Planning Department. (2014, Jul).

Language The Yurlayurlanya language is classified by Gavan Breen as one of the Palku subgroup of the Karnic languages. They also had a sign language. Country They were indigenous to the Boulia area, but were eventually pushed out as white pastoral settlements expanded in their territory. Pituri The Yurlayurlanya seemed to have played an important role in trading the aboriginal narcotic pituri in Queensland. That form of the word is conserved in their language, while all the surrounding tribes in the Boulia area used a different term:tribe. Thus for the Ayerrereng (Yaroinga) tribe round Lake Nash Station and Urandangi it was neempa; for the Antekerrepenh (Undekerebina), just southwards, between the Georgina and the Northern Territory, it was undakora, for the. Kalkadoon, to their west it was moda; while the contiguous Pitta Pitta and Karanya of the Boulia district called it tarembola and tirumbola respectively. History By the 1890s, Walter Roth stated that the displaced Yurlayurlanya had congregated around Carlo Springs (Mungeribar) and the upper Mulligan River. Reports of sexual abuse in traditional culture Louis Nowra writing of violence in Aboriginal communities cited a report that the Yurlayurlanya, like other tribes in the Glenormiston area, would ambush girls to deflower them. Four would pin one down, and, while her eyes were covered, one, presumed to be elderly, would emerge from a nearby hide-out, slit her perineum with a stone knife, and penetrate her with 3 fingers. This 'operation' was a prelude to gang rape, the original four copulating with her three times, the last occasion being the following morning. The original source, the ethnographical report by Walter Roth, discussed the Yurlayurlanya case in the context of tribes practicing both sub-incision on males and, in this case, introcision on females. It is a ceremonial rite, following a corroboree. A girl who is recognized as having achieved full puberty is enticed out of the camp by an aged woman, the pretext being to harvest papa- seed. The introcision transforms her from a wapiri to a kanari. The first copulation is followed by her being adorned with red and white bands of charcoal and feather-down, fixed by the blood from her wound. After successive copulations, the semen is scooped into a coolamon and, mixed with water, used as a curative for the sick and elderly males. On completion of the rite, the initiated young woman may then wear a variety of ornaments, such as kangaroo teeth on her forehead, and a grass necklace. Reviewing the book, together with Sven Lindqvist's Exterminate All the Brutes, Robert Manne argued that Nowra tried to anchor the sociopathic elements of contemporary broken Aboriginal societies back in time to the traditional cultures prevailing in their pre- white nomadic world. Manne notes a number of key distortions of sources, and while allowing that violence was not alien to the older Aboriginal world, it was acknowledged almost universally that children were exempt from it, and indeed it was thought they were overindulgent.

His research group at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology focuses on the epigenetic mechanisms governing the assembly of specialised domains of chromatin and their transmission through cell division. Early life and education Allshire grew up in the fishing village of Howth, Co Dublin 1960-1978. His parents were Arthur Gordon Allshire (1925-2012) who was a Pharmacist and Freda Margaret (née Schmutz; 1933-2014). He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in Genetics by Trinity College Dublin, in 1981 where he was motivated by the inspirational teaching of David McConnell and colleagues at the Dept of Genetics to undertake post-graduate studies. He subsequently joined the Medical Research Council (MRC) Mammalian Genome Unit at the University of Edinburgh where he obtained his PhD in 1985 under the guidance of Chris Bostock and Edwin Southern investigating the use of bovine papillomavirus as a chassis for mammalian artificial chromosome construction. Career and research In 1985 Allshire joined Nicholas Hasties research group at the MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh (formerly MRC Clinical and Population Cytogentics Unit) as a postdoctoral researcher where he discovered that mammalian telomeres are composed of simple repetitive sequences similar to those of unicellular eukaryotes and that telomere length in blood cells shorten with age and are further eroded in cancerous cells. This work resulted from following the fate of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) telomeres after introdroducing fission yeast chromosomes into mouse cell in collaoration with Peter Fantes. In 1989 he took a position as an independent visiting scientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) for 18 months before joining the MRC Human Genetics Unit as a junior group leader. While at CSHL he decided to switch his focus to investigating chromosomal elements in the genetically tractable fission yeast. At the MRC HGU, Edinburgh (1990 - 2002), and subsequently at the Wellome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, University of Edinburgh (2002–present), he discovered that genes are silenced when placed within fission yeast centromeres and telomeres, and then utilised this gene silencing to gain fundamental insights into the processes of chromosome segregation, and heterochromatin and kinetochore CENP-A chromatin establishment and maintenance. He is particularly interested in the epigenetic mechanisms that allow the persistence of specialised chromatin domains through multiple cell divisions and meiosis. He has investigated how RNA interference (RNAi) mediates heterochromatin formation and shown that splicing fators contribute to heterochromatin integrity via siRNA generation and RNAi. He has provided insight into how transcription and resulting non-coding RNA might influence the assembly of specialised CENP-A chromatin and demonstrated that some acts of lncRNA transcription are responsive to environmental stimuli and regulate neighbouring genes by transcriptional interference. Recently using fission yeast his team discovered an epigenetic mechanism that allows fungi to develop resistance to antifungal drugs without alterations to their DNA. This finding is important for understanding how pathogenic fungi become resistant to the limited number of available antifungal agents in both clinical and agricultural arenas. =Awards and honours= Allshire was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2005 , a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2011 and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2020 . * 2013 Genetics Society Medal  References  20th-century British biologists 21st-century British biologists 1960 births Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellows Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Fellows of the Royal Society of Biology Living people ","title":"Robin Allshire"},{"id":"52495925","text":"Better Together is an album by Gaither Vocal Band.

The Commerce and Trade Group is responsible for the commercial diplomacy and economic development of Pakistan. In order to safeguard Pakistan's commercial interests and enhance market access, the CTG was created in 1973 to help Pakistan in developing Pakistan trade ties abroad and to cater the modern needs of specialized officer for trade policy and implementation.http://csspk.com/Commerce_Trade_Group.htm The Officers from this cadre are mainly posted in the Ministry of Commerce, Trade Development Authority of Pakistan Ministry of Commerce, Intellectual Property Organization (IPO), Pakistan Horticulture Development and Export Company, Pakistan Institute of Trade and Development(PITAD). Besides they are posted in Trade Missions Abroad as Trade and Investment Attaches (BS 18), Trade and Investment Counselors (BS 19), Trade Minister/Counsel General (BS 20/21), and Ambassador to the WTO (BS 21). CTG officers negotiate bilateral, multilateral and unilateral trade deals with the trade partners of Pakistan. They are not only responsible for international trade but domestic commerce as well. They formulate and implement trade policy, which lays out the fundamentals of the commercial choices for the country. The job description also includes formulating the Tariff Policy of Pakistan. The group has attained more importance in the wake of the global shift from political to commercial/economic diplomacy. The CTG mans the Ministry of Commerce and its attached departments, as well as other economic ministries and provincial departments that deal with commerce, investment, industries, and agriculture. The new entrants into this service go through a compulsory 9-months training program in Civil Sevices Academy which is called Common Training Program(CTP) along-with all other services and groups. After that, they undergo a 10-month Specialized Training Program(STP) where they learn the Multilateral Trading System, World Trade Organisation(WTO), Development Economics, and other relevant subjects. The CTG is a part of the Ministry of Commerce. They lead foreign trade negotiations with different countries to secure trade deals. Pakistan has successfully negotiated three Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with Sri Lanka, China, and Malaysia, as well as three Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with Iran, Mauritius, and Indonesia. Pakistan is also part of SAFTA and ECOTA. Through successful negotiations, Pakistan secured GSP-plus status from the EU, which means that more than 90% of Pakistan's exports are received at zero import duty by the 28 countries of the EU.

The squat housed 50 people and provided workspace for 100. Background Urban squats are a widespread phenomenon. Occupancy without legal title – also defined as squatting – has always existed, but the Binz falls in the category of squats organized by or at least supported by a social movement, also described with the term political squatting. Political squatting offers not only a radical solution to the crisis of housing, it is also a collective experiment in communal living and directly connected to strategies of urban renewal. The Binz was not just an occupancy without legal title, it was a place where alternative forms of living were practiced and non-commercial culture was supported. Binz in 2013 Occupation From 2009 until 2013, the Binz squatters were constantly negotiating the demolition date of the factory with the city government and organized different protests against the forthcoming eviction. The protest with the biggest media response was also the final one. During the night of March 3, 2013, a party at the Binz led to a non-permitted demonstration. During the party, the organizers asked the guests to take over the streets and continue the party in public space as a way of protesting against the upcoming eviction. The demonstration started as a peaceful demonstration with 2000 mainly young people accompanied by several self-constructed cars serving as mobile DJ stands, stages for live bands and mobile bars. The situation escalated quickly when the protesters confronted the police. During the ensuing riots, several shops were plundered, road barricades were set up and large-scale property damage occurred while the police took action against the protesters with tear gas, rubber pellets and water guns. The material damage was estimated by the police to be about one million Swiss Francs. Despite the dimension of the riots, nobody was arrested. Eviction At the end of May 2013, the Binz squatters left the factory building voluntarily on the day of the defined deadline. The majority of the occupants moved to another squatted factory in the district of Altstetten.

The play was first performed at the 3LD Art & Technology Center in New York City in 2010. It was produced by Aaron Louis in association with New Georges & The Essentials and starred writer Marielle Heller in the lead role of Minnie Goetze. The original production was directed by Sarah Cameron Sunde and Rachel Eckerling. The play follows the coming-of-age story of 15 year-old Minnie Goetze living in San Francisco in 1976.  Background  Marielle Heller adapted The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures after having read the book, which she found to be a jarring and life-changing experience. She immediately contacted the publisher for the rights. Initially dismissed and written off having never pursued the rights to anything, Heller wouldn't take no for an answer. She persisted for months, and finally got her pitch through to Gloeckner, who was impressed with her vision. With Gloeckner's blessing secure, Heller began to develop the adaptation, first with the mentorship of Berkeley Repertory Theatre's Artistic Director Tony Taccone, and then in collaboration with the directing team of Sarah Cameron Sunde and Rachel Eckerling.  Premise  Expulsion, a drunken mother, drug abuse, and an affair with her mom's boyfriend: these are the elements that make up fifteen- year-old Minnie's life as she grows up in the chaos of the 70s. But Minnie is incredibly bright and self-reflective, and narrates her story in her diary with brutally honest words and drawings. This acclaimed adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel sparkles with wit, curiosity, and optimism despite the loneliness and abuse that Minnie encounters. A poignant look into an ugly adolescence.  List of Characters  Minnie Goetze, a 15 year old aspiring artist. Charlotte, Minnie's mother. Monroe, Charlotte's boyfriend. Pascal, Charlotte's ex-husband and Minnie's stepfather. Kimmie, Minnie's best friend.  Original Production (2010)  The original production ran at the 3LD Art & Technology Center from March 15 - May 1, 2010. = Reception = * \\"The great achievement of The Diary of a Teenage Girl, adapted from Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel, is to take the girl's point of view seriously. Neither sentimental nor judgmental, Diary presents Minnie Goetze as a smart, creative, passionate young woman, and the production's only agenda is to be true to her experience.\\" - Backstage * \\"The Diary of a Teenage Girl, the compelling 2002 novel in words and comics by Phoebe Gloeckner, stings with truth... Now 'Diary' -- an account of Minnie's largely unsupervised adolescence in the Bay Area, drifting through its druggy, erotic morass in the '70s and agonizing through a sexual entanglement with her mother's boyfriend -- has been reverently adapted by Marielle Heller... In streamlining the story, Ms. Heller centers on the toxic bond between Minnie and Monroe, and the production best succeeds as a lacerating indictment of predatory male self-indulgence...\\" - The New York Times * \\"I think what may be controversial about this production is that it is not a morality tale and it is not a victim narrative. Minnie is almost always portrayed as having agency. She's not exploited by her 34 year old lover, she doesn't 'realize the errors of her ways' and magically reform into a good girl. What she does is survive.\\" - Culturebot * \\"The Diary of a Teenage Girl: The Play is riveting theater, and as skillful a comics adaptation as I've come across.

The novel tells the story of David Lurie, an Orthodox Jewish boy from the Bronx growing up in the Great Depression of the 1930s up to the revealing of the fate of the Lurie family's relatives in Poland at the end of World War II.Sanford V. Sternlicht Chaim Potok: A Critical Companion 2000 0313311811 p. 96 \\"In the Beginning, Chaim Potok's fourth novel, reflects his preoccupation with the theme of maturation. Again a bright young Jewish male from an Orthodox or ultra- Orthodox New York City Jewish family grows up and successfully rebels against the constraints of parents and community. .\\" Plot At the beginning of the novel, David Lurie is a six-year-old boy growing up in the Bronx in the late 1920s. David is a smart and sensitive boy who is frequently ill due to an injury suffered as a newborn: a deviated septum caused by a fall onto the stone steps of their apartment as his parents were bringing him home from the hospital. David's mother and father, both Polish Jews from Lemberg, had emigrated to the United States after the war along with many of their friends, seeking a better life in a country less hostile to Jews. David's mother Ruth was first married to Max's brother David, who was killed in a pogrom following the war, after which Max married Ruth as prescribed by Jewish law. The main character David is often said to resemble his dead Uncle David with his love of reading and sensitive nature. Max, who had been a member of the Polish army only to come home to anti-Semitic persecution, founded a group called the Am Kedoshim Society (\\"nation of holy people\\") with many friends who had served with him in the war, with the goal of actively fighting anti-Semites. After the war, Max sought to move all of the members of the society from Poland to America, as well as his and his wife's parents and extended families. The two families resist making such a drastic change and ultimately decide not to leave Poland, but the final member of the Society arrives in America just before the stock market crash of 1929. After the crash, the society's finances are decimated, its members scatter to more affordable areas of New York, and Max sinks into a depression, feeling that he has made a terrible mistake in encouraging everyone to move to a land that is seemingly no longer prosperous. Max eventually recovers and decides to become a watchmaker; beginning with a small watch repair business, he eventually starts a small chain of jewelry stores. During World War II, the German invasion of Poland cuts off contact between the Luries and their families there. After the war ends, the Luries learn that everyone in both families -- nearly one hundred and fifty people -- were killed in Bergen Belsen. During the course of the novel, David develops an interest in Bible scholarship, and eventually discovers secular authors who discuss the human origins of the Bible, in direct opposition to the belief that the Bible is the word of God as revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. David perceives an edge of anti-Semitism in many of these works, but finds it difficult to ignore the scholarly arguments these authors are making. David's ultimate destiny is to become a Bible scholar who is still a person of faith -- to employ modern methods to make a new beginning for his people.

The village of Lyngiades, near Ioannina in northwestern Greece, was arbitrarily chosen as a target for reprisals by the Wehrmacht due to the killing of a German officer by members of the Greek Resistance. The vast majority of the victims were children, women and elderly. Background Greek resistance groups were active in northwestern Greece (Epirus) during World War II. On one occasion a unit of the National Republican Greek League (EDES) ambushed a German convoy near Preveza. As a result of this action, regiment commander Col. Josef Salminger was shot by Greek resistance fighters. Salminger was notorious for orchestrating various attacks against civilians, such as the massacre of Kommeno which resulted in the death of 317 villagers.Hermann, 2008, p. 423 The village of Lygiades could not be clearly linked with any resistance activity by German intelligence. One of the reasons it was chosen as a target might be the fact that the village was visible from the nearby regional capital of Ioannina, thus its destruction would likely spread fear among the local population.Meyer, 2009, p. 483 The attack Everyone who could not escape was dragged by the German soldiers to the central square of the village. After the dwellings were extensively searched and looted, all civilians were divided into small groups and driven into the cellars of various dwellings. There they were shot down by machine guns. Apart from the church and the village school, all the buildings in the village were set on fire.Meyer, 2009, p. 485 The vast majority of the 92 victims were children, infants, women and elderly. Five civilians managed to survive: two adults and three children. They pretended to be dead among the corpses and then escaped from the burning buildings by ascending from the fireplace. Most of the local adults were not in the village at the time of the attack because they were working in adjacent villages, and thus they escaped death.Meyer, 2009, p. 473 Memory On March 7, 2014, German President Joachim Gauck visited Lyngiades together with his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias. Gauck became the first official representative of Germany to visit the site, and expressed his apologies for the atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht troops:Kambas, Mitsou, 2015, p. 51: \\"...

It was modelled on the London Great Exhibition of 1851 and was the idea of Augustus Constantine Sinclair who ran the Government Printing Office in Jamaica. Background In the 1880s, Jamaica's economy was in decline. Sugar exports were only a quarter of what they had been the start of the century, and the banana export business was in its infancy. There was a great need to promote Jamaican products to the world and attract investment to the island.Jamaica International Exhibition, 1891. Joy Lumsden. Retrieved 6 December 2016.

For many years, they were unable to drum up sufficient support for the project, but in 1889 Sir Henry Blake arrived as the new governor of Jamaica and gave the idea his blessing.Pieces of the Past.

By 8 August 1860 there were already enough Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) in Devonshire to form an Administrative Brigade with its Headquarters (HQ) at Teignmouth:Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, p. 654.1st Devonshire Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 52–4.Army Lists. 1st Administrative Brigade, Devonshire Artillery Volunteers * HQ at Teignmouth; moved to Torquay in 1863 and to Exeter in 1865 * 1st (United Woodbury and Topsham 'Royal') Devonshire AVC, raised 18 August 1859 at Woodbury by Robert Brent, formerly a Lieutenant in the Devon Artillery Militia; moved to Lympstone in 1874 * 2nd (Sidmouth) Devonshire AVC, raised 4 September 1859; disbanded November 1871 * 3rd (Teignmouth) Devonshire AVC, raised 15 November 1859 * 4th (Torquay) Devonshire AVC, raised 15 February 1860; had an additional half battery for a while from 9 October 1860 * 5th (Exeter) Devonshire AVC, raised 8 February 1860; later had a second battery * 6th (Dartmouth) Devonshire AVC, raised 25 January 1860; transferred to 2nd Administrative Brigade in January 1861 * 7th (Weymouth) Devonshire AVC, raised at Weymouth, Dorsetshire, 11 March 1860; moved to Exmouth, Devonshire in July 1860 * 8th (Woodbury) Devonshire AVC, raised 31 March 1860; moved to Topsham in late 1861 and to Heavitree in May 1875 * 9th (Paignton) Devonshire AVC, formed as a section 2 June 1860, raised to a full battery 3 December 1860 * 10th (Salcombe) Devonshire AVC, formed as a sub-division 7 July 1860, raised to a full battery August 1860; transferred to 2nd Administrative Brigade in January 1861 * 11th (Brixham) Devonshire AVC, raised 20 July 1860 * 12th (Devonport Dockyard) Devonshire AVC, raised 20 December 1860; transferred to 2nd Administrative Brigade in February 1862 * 14th (Ilfracombe) Devonshire AVC, raised 23 June 1875 In January 1861, a 2nd Administrative Brigade was formed, taking over the units in the west of the county.2nd Devonshire Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org. Sir Lawrence Palk, 4th Bt, a former officer in 1st The Royal Dragoons, became lieutenant- colonel commanding the brigade on 2 September 1863, and honorary colonel in 1868, when Brent (promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 13 February 1866) took over command and Palk's son, Lawrence, (formerly an officer in the Scots Fusilier Guards) became a major in the unit. In January 1866, the 1st (Lyme Regis), 3rd (Bridport) and 4th (Portland) AVCs from the neighbouring county of Dorsetshire were included in the 1st Devonshire Administrative Brigade, joined by the 5th (Charmouth) and 6th (Swanage) upon formation in 1868 and 1869. All the Dorsetshire AVCs were transferred to the 1st Hampshire Administrative Brigade in January 1873. In 1880, the AVCs were consolidated, and the 1st Devonshire Administrative Brigade became the 1st Devonshire AVC with the following composition: * HQ at Exeter * No 1 Battery at Lympstone; later at Tor Square, Torquay,Torquay at Drill Hall Project. with detachment at Lympstone,Lympstone at Drill Hall Project. former 1st Corps * No 2 Battery at Drill Hall, New Market Buildings, Brixham,Brixham at Drill Hall Project. former 11th Corps * No 3 Battery at Northumberland Place, West Teignmouth,Teignmouth at Drill Hall Project. former 3rd Corps * No 4 Battery at Market Hall, Torquay, former 4th Corps * Nos 5 & 6 Batteries at Exeter, former 5th Corps * No 7 Battery HQ at Exeter Road (later at Ferry Road), Exmouth, with the guns at the beach,Exmouth at Drill Hall Project. former 7th Corps * No 8 Battery at Fore Street, Heavitree,Exeter at Drill Hall Project. former 8th Corps * No 9 Battery at Public Hall, Paignton,Paignton at Drill Hall Project. former 9th Corps * No 10 Battery HQ at Drill Hall, Avenue Road, and Armoury at 24 Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe,Ilfracombe at Drill Hall Project. later HQ and Armoury at 2 Croft Side, High Street, Ilfracombe, former 14th Corps The corps was attached to the Western Division of the Royal Artillery from 1 April 1882, changing its designation to 1st Volunteer (Devonshire) Brigade, Western Division on 1 September 1886. It changed its name to 1st Devonshire Volunteer Artillery in November 1891, and the batteries were termed companies. By 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 1st Devonshire Artillery Volunteers to the Plymouth fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 On 1 June 1899 the Royal Artillery was split into two branches, and the Artillery Volunteers were assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The divisional organisation was abandoned on 1 January 1902 and the unit was re-titled 1st Devonshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers).Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 4–6. Armament The 14th (Ilfracombe) Devonshire AVC was issued with a rifled gun together with a store of shot and powder in 1876, and it was installed on Beacon Point. In 1885, the battery at Beacon Point consisted of a 64-pounder RML gun and a 32-pounder mortar. In succeeding years, the old 64-pounder was sent to Combe Martin, where the unit had formed a half-battery, and two new 64-pounders replaced it and the mortar at Beacon Point. In 1905, two new 6-inch breechloading guns were installed at Beacon Point.Artillery Volunteer Battery at John Moore's History of Hele. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 1st Devonshire RGA became a brigade in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA). , initially as , changing to . Its planned organisation was to have been the III (or 3rd) Wessex Brigade of two Devonshire batteries and the 3rd ammunition column. However it changed to the IV (or 4th) Wessex in October 1908, and its final organisation in 1910 was as follows:Frederick, p. 682.Litchfield, pp. 42–8.London Gazette 20 March 1908.London Gazette 14 October 1910.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 43–8.

World War I =Mobilisation= On 26 July 1914, the Wessex Division was on Salisbury Plain, beginning its annual training. Three days later, with the international situation deteriorating, the division was warned to take 'precautionary measures'. The divisional HQ returned to Exeter and the units took up their precautionary posts across South West England. On 4 August, the division was ordered to mobilise for war. Between 10 and 13 August the division returned to Salisbury Plain, this time under war conditions. In September, the War Office decided to raise 2nd Line TF units and formations, so the IV Wessex (now designated the 1/IV Wessex) began recruiting a duplicate unit, the 2/IV Wessex Brigade, RFA, which would serve in the 2nd Wessex Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 55–60. =1/IV Wessex Brigade= On 24 September, the 1st Wessex Division accepted liability for service in British India to relieve Regular Army units for the Western Front. The division's infantry battalions and field artillery brigades (less the ammunition columns, which were left behind) embarked at Southampton on 9 October and sailed via Gibraltar, Malta, and the Suez Canal to Bombay, where they disembarked on 9 November. Each of the brigade's three batteries arrived in India with five officers and 140 other ranks, manning four 15-pounder field guns. Although the 1st Wessex was officially numbered the 43rd (Wessex) Division in early 1915, it never served as a complete formation during the war: on arrival in India all its units were distributed to various garrisons, the individual batteries of the 1/IV Wessex Bde being posted to separate stations. No reinforcements reached the units during 1915, and their strength began to dwindle, made worse by the requirement to provide drafts for other theatres of war, while many of the best Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) were taken away for officer training. By 1916, it was clear that the complete division could not be returned to the Western Front as intended, so instead training was pushed forwards in India, some drafts were received from home, and the obsolescent 15-pounders were replaced by modern 18-pounder guns, to enable individual units to be sent to reinforce other theatres of war. The RFA brigades received numbers, the 1/IV Wessex becoming the CCXVIII (218th) Brigade, and in 1917 the batteries were also numbered, the 1/1st, 1/2nd and 1/3rd Devonshire Batteries becoming the 1094th, 1095th and 1096th. Subsequently, the batteries were increased to a strength of six guns by splitting one battery (1095th) up amongst the others. In July 1918, the brigade was returned to three-battery strength by the addition of 1104th (2/1st Wiltshire) Battery from 45th (2nd Wessex) Division (see below), so that by the end of the war the brigade had the following organisation:Frederick, p. 695. CCXVIII Brigade, RFA * 1094th (1/1st Devonshire) Battery * 1096th (1/3rd Devonshire) Battery * 1104th (2/1st Wiltshire) Battery =2/IV Wessex Brigade= The units of the 2nd Wessex Division began to form as soon as the 1st Wessex had embarked for India. Any officers and men left behind by the 1st Line units were used to train the 2nd Line. On 25 November, the War Office decided to send the 2nd Wessex to India as well, despite its lack of training. On 12 December 1914, the whole division embarked at Southampton and disembarked at Bombay 4–8 January 1915. The RFA batteries arrived with the same strength of five officers and 140 other ranks, equipped with four 15-pounders. Only in March 1915 was it discovered that half the 15-pounders had obturator pads made of wood, and could not be used for practice until these items had been replaced from England. Once the units were trained, they suffered from the same drain as the 1st Line, having to provide drafts for active theatres of war and losing their best NCOs for officer training. As with the 43rd Division, the artillery brigades of the 45th Division were gradually re-armed with the 18-pounder and received numbers, the 2/IV Wessex becoming CCXXVIII (228th). On 12 August 1916, the 2/1st Devonshire Bty (later renumbered 1105th), was sent to Aden where it was re-equipped with 5-inch howitzers. It remained there until demobilisation in March 1919. The 2/2nd Devonshire Bty received the number 1106, but was broken up during 1917 to bring other batteries up to 6-gun establishment. By April 1917, CCXXVIII Bde had disappeared: the 2/1st Devonshire Bty at Aden was formally attached to CCXXVII (former 2/III Wessex) Bde and the 2/3rd Devonshire (which had become 1107th (Howitzer) Battery) joined XXI Bde RFA in 4th (Quetta) Division, stationed in Baluchistan in the southern part of the North West Frontier, where it remained until the end of World War I.Perry, p. 65. 3rd Afghan War When World War I ended in November 1918, very few of the two Wessex Divisions' original units remained in India; CCXVIII Brigade represented the largest remaining group of Wessex field gun batteries. The TF units could have expected to be demobilised and returned home, but instead several of them were retained for service in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919.Robson, pp. 12 & 26.Miller, pp. 318–9. 4th (Quetta) Division was a designated reserve formation for mobilisation on the North West Frontier. Its field artillery consisted of XXI Brigade RFA, which already included 1107th (2/3rd Devonshire) (H) Bty and was joined for the campaign by 1104th (2/1st Wiltshire) Bty from CCXVIII Bde. Meanwhile, the 1096th (1/3rd Devonshire) Bty from CCXVIII Bde joined the 46th Mobile Indian Brigade, and later the Kohat–Kurram Field Force.Robson, Appendix 1, p. 281. Fighting on the Afghan frontier started in May 1919, and reinforcements were sent into Baluchistan so that the area commander was able to concentrate a force at New Chaman for an attack on the Afghan frontier stronghold of Spin Boldak. The artillery of this force consisted of the 102nd Bty (with 18-pounders) and the 1107th (2/3rd Devonshire) Bty (with 4.5-inch and 5-inch howitzers), both from XXI Bde RFA. The attack on 27 May began with a creeping barrage fired by the 18-pounders while the howitzers of the Devonshires bombarded the fort and its outlying towers. The fort fell that afternoon, prompting strenuous attempts by the Afghans to retake it before the peace was signed in August.Robson, pp. 111–6. Interwar When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 the unit was reformed as the new 3rd Wessex Brigade, RFA, with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Devonshire Btys and a Dorsetshire Bty from the old III Wessex Bde. However, when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 it was redesignated the 56th Wessex, the batteries were numbered and then lost the 'shire' from their titles in June 1924, when the RFA was amalgamated into the RA. By 1927 the brigade had left 43rd (Wessex) Division and been redesignated as an Army Field Brigade:Frederick, p. 516.Titles and Designations 1927. 56th (Wessex) Army Field Brigade, RA * HQ and 221st (Devon) Bty, Drill Hall, Barrack Lane, Exeter * 222nd (Devon) Bty (Howitzers), Drill Hall, Paignton * 223rd (Devon) Bty, Drill Hall, Crelake, Tavistock * 224th (Dorset) Bty, Royal Horse Artillery Barracks, Dorchester The title was changed to 56th (Devon) in March 1928, and in July 1929 the 224th (Dorset) Bty was transferred to the 94th (Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry) Army Fd Bde. In November 1938, the RA replaced its designation of 'brigade' for alieutenant-colonel's command by the more modern 'regiment'; the 56th was due to become the 56th (Devon) Field Regiment, but the RA was also beginning a programme of converting units to the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role. The 56th became the 51st (Devon) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (one of the first Light AA (LAA) units to be formed in the TA):Frederick, pp. 802, 828–9.51 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. * 151st (Devon) LAA Bty at Exeter * 152nd (Devon) LAA Bty at Paignton * 153rd (Devon) LAA Bty at Crelake, Tavistock. After the Munich Crisis in 1938, the TA was doubled in size, and the 51st formed a duplicate unit at Exeter in 1939, the 55th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA:55 LAA Rgt at RA 39–45. * 163rd LAA Bty * 164th LAA Bty * 165th LAA Bty World War II =51st (Devon) LAA= Dunkirk Bofors gun of 152nd Bty, 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt in France, 13 November 1939 The Territorial Army mobilised on the outbreak of war. The War Office's plan was that the first four newly formed TA LAA regiments would go to France as soon as they could be mobilised, in order to provide AA cover for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).Routledge, pp. 113 & 373. 51st (Devon) LAA Regiment therefore crossed to France as part of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (2nd AA Bde).Farndale, Annex A, p. 237.Ellis, Appendix A.Joslen, p. 462.Routledge, Table p. 373. The new LAA regiments were still badly under-equipped for overseas service, having only a small number of their establishment of Bofors 40 mm guns and a lot of Light machine guns (LMGs), usually old Lewis guns, and a reduced scale of transport for a mobile role. In November 1939, 51st LAA only possessed 12 Bofors and 48 LMGs.Farndale, p. 241.Routledge, Table XVII, p. 125. On 2 December 1939 the regiment was joined by 6 LAA Bty, a Special Reserve battery that had been formed at Coleraine within 9th AA Rgt before that regiment specialised as heavy AA.Frederick, pp. 766, 800. When the German offensive began on 10 May 1940, 2nd AA Bde's task was to defend the airfields of the BEF's Air Component.Routledge, Table XVIII, p. 126. As the Luftwaffe began the air raids that heralded the German offensive, 151st LAA Bty was in action at Abbeville airfield with A and C Troops. C Troop soon registered a hit, and A Trp claimed 11 hits during the day, but a Battery Quartermaster Sergeant (BQMS) and three gunners were killed.Farndale, p. 63. The BEF began its planned advanced into Belgium, but the German Army broke through the Ardennes, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, the AA batteries giving cover leap-frog fashion. Soon they were sucked into the ground battle, split into sub-units to join rearguard actions or moved back from one key point to another, with all the roads choked with refugees. By 21 May, 151st Bty had A Trp defending Hazebrouck, where an enemy aircraft was brought down, while B Trp was at Merville. Next, A Trp went to the defence of Cassel, where it was attacked by tanks and aircraft. One gun was hit and one had to be abandoned. Second Lieutenant Forbes went out to find the remaining two guns but was never heard of again. Sergeant Lord and 22 men eventually got out at Dunkirk. By now, the BEF was withdrawing towards the coast and beginning its evacuation from Dunkirk. 2nd AA Brigade took over control of all AA defences in Dunkirk on 24 May, with 51st LAA Rgt providing air defence in the northern sector of the pocket.Ellis, p. 180.Farndale, p. 77. At Dunkirk the last three guns of B Trp were constantly in action on Bray-Dunes, one gun being destroyed by a direct hit. Here they were joined by 152nd LAA Bty, with D, E and F Trps, which took up positions on the Dunkirk beaches and went into action at once. They were in continuous action from 21 to 25 May and many aircraft were brought down. The Bty commander, Major F.C. MacKenzie, was killed and buried in the dunes, the second-in-command, Capt A.M. Hicks, was wounded and a 2/Lt took over. By 27 May, all ammunition was expended and the guns were destroyed before the crews were evacuated. The RA history comments: 'This gallant battery had done much to save the BEF from the incessant air attacks n the beaches'. Home defence 6th Armoured Division's emblem AA units returning from France were rapidly reinforced, re-equipped where possible, and redeployed for future integration into Anti-Aircraft Command's existing defence plans. 51st LAA, with 151st, 152nd and 153rd Btys under command, went to No 12 AA Practice Camp, Penhale, where it re-equipped with Bofors guns.Farndale, p. 98. 152nd LAA Bty was soon back in action defending Tangmere airfield during the Battle of Britain, destroying numerous enemy aircraft. The regiment then joined 45th AA Bde in South Wales. On 15 October 1940 6 LAA Bty transferred to 2nd LAA Rgt and later fought in the Western Desert Campaign.Routledge, pp. 135–6. On 15 January 1941, 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt joined 6th Support Group in 6th Armoured Division, which had recently been formed as part of the GHQ Reserve. Support Groups at the time consisted of a brigade of mobile field, anti-tank (A/T) and LAA artillery together with lorried infantry, intended to support the armoured brigades of the division. The LAA regiment was equipped with towed Bofors guns. However, the support group concept was soon scrapped and from 1 June 1942 the regiment served directly under the HQ RA of 6th Armoured Division.Joslen, pp. 17–8.Joslen, p. 217.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/5. Tunisia A British Bofors gun in action during the drive on Tunis, May 1943 6th Armoured Division sailed from England on 8 November 1942, and landed at Algiers as part of Operation Torch, completing its concentration by 22 November.Playfair & Molony, p. 167. In December, V Corps took over operational control of the advance into Tunisia, and sent 6th Armoured to reinforce the infantry of 78th Division. With a front spread over 60 miles, the fighting consisted of confused encounter battles and enemy counter-attacks making skilled use of the terrain, so that British spearhead forces were often outflanked and encircled. AA guns were often involved in ground fighting. 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt had a hard time in these encounters, losing men and guns in actions in which they were encircled by the enemy.Routledge, p. 181. During the Tunisian campaign, 6th Armoured took part in the following major actions:Playfair. * Bou Arada (18–25 January 1943) * Fondouk (7–11 April 1943) * El Kourzia (22–26 April 1943) * Tunis (Operation Vulcan, 5–12 May 1943) At the end of the campaign, 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt claimed to have destroyed 45 enemy aircraft for the expenditure of 62,300 rounds of ammunition – a high figure, but many of these rounds were fired in ground combats. Italy 6th Armoured Division did not participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily nor the early stages of the Italian Campaign, remaining in North Africa until 18 March 1944. It then went to Italy and was operational by April, in time for Eighth Army's Spring campaign.Molony, p. 13. During the campaign, 6th Armoured Division took part in the following actions:Molony.Jackson, Vol VI, Pts II & III. * Liri Valley (18–30 May 1944) * Arezzo (4–17 July 1944) * Advance to Florence (17 July–10 August 1944) By September 1944, the Axis air forces were suffering such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks were rare, and AA units began to be put to other uses. 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt left 6th Armoured Division and rejoined 2nd AA Bde, which was supporting XIII Corps. Although it was responsible for defending a few airfields and other vital points, the brigade's role was mainly to provide Heavy AA guns firing in ground roles, while some of its LAA batteries were being retrained as infantry support troops to meet the increasing manpower crisis.Routledge, p. 282. By the end of the year, 51st (Devon) LAA Rgt had been reduced from 54 to 36 Bofors guns. In January 1945, it had one battery in AA defence of bridges and 6th Armoured Division's gun areas, while the other batteries were carrying out labour duties for the Royal Engineers, transporting ammunition, and firing mortars for infantry support and for projecting smoke screens.2 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 204/7240. In February, first 152nd and then 153rd LAA Btys manned 4.2-inch mortars in support of 6th Armoured Division, then at the end of the month 153rd moved its mortars to support the Folgore Group of the Italian Co-belligerent Army. At the end of March, just before the final Allied offensive in Italy began, 2nd AA Bde had 51st Rgt disposed with 151st and 152nd LAA Btys in AA defence of 10th Indian Infantry Division's gun areas, while 153rd LAA Bty manned its mortars behind the Folgore Group. The Allied armies in Italy launched their spring offensive (Operation Grapeshot) on 6 April 1945 and it made rapid progress. 2nd AA Brigade accompanied X Corps, but had little to do – its guns had trouble keeping up with the speed of the advance. The campaign ended with the surrender of German forces in Italy on 2 May 1945. =55th (Devon) LAA= Norway 55th (Devon) LAA Regiment had already joined the BEF in France, but in April 1940 was diverted to the Allied expedition against Narvik, in Norway. It was sent as part of a new 6th AA Bde to provide AA cover for the forces that had landed at Harstad, an island town just outside Narvikfjord, in mid-April 1940.Joslen, p. 461.Farndale, Annex C, p. 250.Routledge, pp. 109–10.Derry, Appendix B, p. 267. Its three batteries each had 12 Bofors guns, although like all the units in the brigade it was short of men, instruments and vehicles. The regiment arrived at Harstad on 9 May, where the brigade's guns were already engaged against almost daily attacks on the shipping in the fjord. The regiment was sent to defend Harstad airfield, with a Troop of 164th LAA Bty detached to the expedition's naval base at Skånland. The regiment shot down its first aircraft on 10 May, capturing the downed German pilot. By 18 May, 164th LAA Bty had its HQ and eight guns defending Bardufos airfield where Royal Air Force Gloster Gladiator and later Hawker Hurricane fighters were based.Farndale, p. 27.Derry, pp. 149–50, 164 201. Narvik was captured on 28 May, but immediately afterwards orders were received to destroy the port and evacuate to the UK. (The BEF was simultaneously being evacuated from Dunkirk). To cover the evacuation, AA units were ordered to maintain maximum activity and especially to prevent reconnaissance overflights. At the same time, 6th AA Bde was ordered by London to recover its guns as a matter of priority. This was done by progressively thinning out defences. Although much of the force's equipment was saved, 164th LAA Bty at Bardufoss was ordered to destroy all guns on 5 June after the aircraft had flown out and the runways had been cratered. 6th AA Brigade ended all AA defence on 6 June and by 8 June the British troops had embarked with their surviving equipment and the convoy sailed for the UK, still under air attack.Derry, pp. 220–2. Home defence After evacuation, 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt landed in the UK on 13 June and was sent to Troon to re-equip with Bofors guns and then supplement AA Command's defences. In early 1941 it joined 45th AA Bde, covering South Wales in 9th AA Division. Simultaneously the regiment was part of the War Office Reserve, available for service overseas.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA file WO 212/5. It was granted its 'Devon' subtitle on 17 February 1942. Ceylon and India War with Japan broke out in December 1941 and reinforcements were urgently sent to bolster British forces in Asia. 55th (Devon) LAA Regiment, joined by a newly raised 524th LAA Bty, sailed early in 1942, landing at Colombo in Ceylon on 4 March. There it joined 1st Royal Marine AA Bde.Farndale, Far East, Annex K.Farndale, Far East, p. 114; Annex H.Joslen, pp. 524–7. After the fall of Singapore and Burma in early 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to neutralise the important British naval base of Ceylon. Air raids against Colombo and Trincomalee began on 5 April and continued for months. As the AA defences built up and the threat of low-level attacks by carrier-based fighters receded, the LAA units could be redeployed. 1st RM AA Brigade with 55th (Devon) LAA left Ceylon for India in June 1942.Routledge, p. 237; Table XXXVIII, p. 253. In 1942–3, Fourteenth Army fighting in Burma, adopted a new policy with the formation of composite Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank regiments, each containing two LAA and two A/T batteries. This format was intended to help divisions distribute sub-units with balanced firepower and mutual support in close jungle fighting where battle groups often had to move independently.Routledge, p. 239. 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt was one of those selected for conversion, exchanging two batteries with 56th (King's Own) A/T Rgt to become 55th Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank Regiment, RA on 9 August.Frederick, p. 845.55 LAA/AT Rgt at RA 39–45. 56th Anti-Tank Regiment (The King's Own), RA, formerly the 4th Bn King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster),Cowper, p. 277.Litchfield, p. 124. had been heavily engaged in the defence of the River Lys during the Battle of France and then evacuated through Dunkirk.Cowper, pp. 317–30. It had subsequently been joined by a newly formed 290th A/T Bty and by 203rd (Ross) A/T Bty from 51st (West Highland) A/T Rgt, which had evacuated through Cherbourg after the rest of the regiment was destroyed at St Valery with 51st (Highland) Division.Joslen, p. 83.Farndale,pp. 85–91.51 A/T Rgt at RA 39–45. When the exchange with 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt took place, these were the two A/T batteries transferred, while 56th LAA/AT Rgt kept its original King's Own batteries, joined by 163rd and 164th from the 55th. Thus the composition of 55th LAA/AT Rgt, formed on 29 July in the Calcutta area, was as follows: * 165th LAA Bty – TA raised at Exeter 1939 * 524th LAA Bty – raised 1941 * 203rd (Ross) A/T Bty – prewar TA * 290th A/T Bty – raised 1940 In September 1943, 55th LAA/AT Rgt was in training at Marol, Bombay, preparing to join 20th Indian Infantry Division.Routledge, Table XXXVII, p. 253. In October, it moved to Ranchi with the division, and on 1 December it moved to Imphal on the Burma/Assam border and reached Tamu on 16 December. Burma Fourteenth Army's planned attack from Imphal was forestalled by a Japanese offensive that resulted in the Battle of Imphal. 20th Indian Division was holding Tamu, with its troops disposed in a series of brigade 'keeps' or 'boxes' on defensible high ground, and a screen on the Imphal plain. LAA batteries in the forward areas had problems in getting their guns up steep tracks to join infantry positions. 55th LAA/AT Rgt resorted to breaking its Bofors guns down into packs that could be loaded onto transport elephants. In the front line, the Bofors crews developed a technique for destroying Japanese log bunkers by shooting away the front supports until the whole thing collapsed. However, in their AA role, the gunners found it difficult to depress their weapons to hit Zero fighters making sweeps along valley floors.Routledge, pp. 240–3. When the Japanese offensive opened on 6 March 1944, it penetrated between the divisional boxes and 20th Indian Division began withdrawing from its forward screen to its main defensive positions on the Shenan Saddle just short of Palel. The two LAA batteries of 55th LAA/AT Rgt worked with infantry groups leap-frogging back to successive pre-prepared fall-back positions. They suffered shelling and tank attacks (destroying four Japanese tanks), but air attacks were slight (although 524th LAA Bty shot down one attacker). By the first week in April, the regiment was back in the main Imphal defences, in the boxes at Shenam and Bishenpur. Here they were subject to increased air attack by Nakajima Ki-43 fighter-bombers. On 6 April, 165th LAA Bty shot down three with 175 rounds, and another on 10 April. 524th LAA Bty set up outlying 'trap' positions and destroyed two more. By the end of the battle, 20th Indian Division's LAA guns had destroyed 12 aircraft with another four 'possibles'. During the battle, Imphal had been cut off and supplied by air until the Kohima road was reopened in June, after which 20th Indian Division began to advance.Farndale, Far East, pp. 172, 182, 202, 217. The other two batteries from 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt, 163rd and 164th, served with 56th LAA/AT Rgt in 5th Indian Infantry Division on the Arakan front.Joslen, p. 514.56 A/T Rgt at RA 39–45.56 LAA/AT Rgt at RA 39–45. Again, the British had formed air-supplied defensive 'boxes'. 56th LAA/AT Rgt provided AA defence for 5th Indian Division's HQ box, with Bofors guns operating in field gun areas, brigade boxes, in ground role actions against enemy strongpoints and in ambushes against infiltrators, while the A/T gunners were employed as infantry. The division's boxes were besieged from 7 to 13 February, with the gunners in frequent actions against air attacks and infantry, but it was the Japanese supplies that failed first. Reinforcements cleared the road block behind 5th Indian Division, which then resumed its advance, while 56th LAA/AT Rgt was responsible for defending North Island at Maungdaw. In March the Monsoon broke and 5th Indian Division was relieved, 56th LAA/AT Rgt returning to Elephant Point near Cox's Bazar for a rest.Cowper, pp. 427, 432–9.. The division then took part in the relief of Imphal, 163rd and 164th LAA batteries moving by road to Dimapur where they assumed an infantry role while the A/T batteries were flown into the box. When the British counter-offensive began in May, RHQ and the AA batteries of 56th LAA/AT Rgt accompanied 2nd British Division in the advance from Kohima to ImphalCowper, pp. 432, 438-9. By mid-1944, the Allies were achieving air superiority over Burma, sightings of Japanese aircraft had become rare and LAA guns were more often being used against ground targets in jungle fighting. Some LAA units were broken up to provide reinforcements for the infantry, while the LAA/AT units became solely A/T.Routledge, pp. 244–6. Between 17 July and 1 September 1944, while back at Yairipok in India, 55th LAA/AT Rgt was converted into 111th (Devon) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA with 165th (later numbered 524th), 203rd and 290th A/T Btys.Farndale, p. 227.Frederick, p. 928.Joslen, p. 516.111 A/T Rgt at RA 39–45. 56th LAA/AT Rgt reverted to 56th A/T Rgt on 1 October 1944, when 163rd LAA Bty became 351st A/T Bty, but operated infantry support mortars, while 164th LAA Bty left the regiment and remained directly under 5th Indian Division HQ. In December 1944, 111th A/T Rgt went back into Burma with 20th Indian Division. In February 1945, the division established a bridgehead across the Irrawaddy River west of Mandalay, and in March it attacked southwards down the Irrawaddy, reaching Rangoon soon after its capture in Operation Dracula. By now both reqiments were equipped with 36 x 6-pounder A/T guns and 36 x 3-inch mortars. In April–May 111th A/T Rgt sank a number of Japanese boats on the Irrawaddy. The regiment remained with 20th India Division until the end of June.20 Ind Div at Orders of Battle. 111th (Devon) A/T Rgt and its batteries were placed in suspended animation at the RA Depot at Woolwich on 23 October 1945. On 21 March 1945, 56th A/T Rgt set out from Assam to join the last phase of the war in Burma. . By the beginning of April 20th Indian Division was concentrated at Meiktila airfield, defending against repeated Japanese attempts to retake it. 5th Indian Division then took part in the advance towards Rangoon, with 56th A/T supporting 4/7th Rajputs in successful attacks on two enemy strongpoints with their 6-pdrs and mortars.Cowper, p. 466. Once Rangoon had been captured, the regiment returned by sea to India, where it came under command of RA Training HQ No 40 until the end of the war. Postwar =83 LAA/SL Regiment= When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the personnel then serving in 51st LAA Rgt were transferred to a new war-formed unit with the same regimental and battery numbers. On 1 April 1947 this was redesignated 83 LAA/Searchlight Regiment in the Regular Army with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 602, 620, 622, 958.81–93 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. * 151 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 32 Coast Bty (captured at the Fall of Singapore in 1942Farndale, Far East, Annex A.) as 229 LAA Bty * 152 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 37 Coast Bty (served in Sierra Leone and placed in suspended animation in 1943) as 232 LAA Bty * 153 LAA Bty – disbanded to resuscitate 31 Coast Bty (captured at the Fall of Singapore) as 233 LAA Bty This regiment was placed in suspended animation on 1 April 1948, then reformed 15 days later as a heavy AA regiment, but apparently reverted to LAA before finally entering suspended animation at Brackley, Northamptonshire, on 21 September that year. =256 (Devon) LAA Regiment= Meanwhile, the TA regiment was reformed at Exeter as 256 (Devon) LAA Regiment in 81 AA Brigade of Anti-Aircraft Command based in Plymouth.

The 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt was intended to be reconstituted as 852nd (Devon) Tractor Battery, RA, but was instead transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps.Frederick, p. 1030. In 1949, the 256th was redesignated the 256th (Devon) (Mixed) LAA/Searchlight Rgt ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). In 1950, it absorbed the 396th (Devon) LAA Rgt, which had originally been the 7th (Haytor) Bn of the Devonshire Regiment at Newton Abbot, and had served in World War II as the 87th Anti-Tank Rgt, RA. By now, the regiment had dropped the 'Searchlight' part of its designation. In 1954, it absorbed the 668th (Devon and Cornwall) (M) Heavy AA Rgt (a new unit that had been formed at Plymouth in 1947). Then in 1955, when AA Command was disbanded and there was a major reduction in the TA's AA units, the regiment was merged with 524th (M) LAA/SL Rgt (7th Bn The Royal Hampshire Regiment) to form:520–563 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.638–677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. 256th (Wessex) LAA Regiment, RA * HQ: Devonport * P (Royal Hampshire) Bty – from 524 Rgt * Q (Devon) Bty – from 256 Rgt * R (Devon) Bty – from 256 Rgt The following year, the amalgamations continued, with the 256th LAA Rgt absorbing the 407th (Devon) Coast Rgt, RA (which had originally been the 2nd Admin Brigade of Devonshire Artillery Volunteers, see above).372–413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. Finally, in 1961, the regiment's lineage ended when it was absorbed into the 296th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Rgt, RA, except P (Royal Hampshire) Bty, which joined 383rd Light Rgt (The Duke of Connaught's Royal Hampshire), RA.289–322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

Julian Prakash, based on the backdrop of Jallikattu. It features Yuvan and Anu Krishna in the lead roles, with Akhil and Ravi Mariya in supporting roles, and Kishore in a guest appearance. Ilami had a low profile theatrical release on 25 November 2016. Cast * Yuvan as Karuppu * Anu Krishna as Ilami * Akhil as Sadai Puli * Ravi Mariya as Verayyan * Kishore as a king (guest appearance) Production Julian Prakash revealed that he was inspired to make a film about vadam jallikattu as a result of his fascination with the sport, while growing up as a youngster in Madurai and called for more Tamil people to celebrate their culture. While rookie actors Yuvan and Akhil were cast in the film in the leading and lead negative roles, Anu Krishna, previously seen in Kaththi (2014), was signed on to portray the titular character. To resemble scenes from the year 1715, director Prakash and his team constructed a huge set in Talakona, a forested area in Andhra Pradesh. This came after the team trialled a smaller set at Theni, near Madurai, in Tamil Nadu, but found it difficult to find any place in the state that was untouched by 21st century development. To prepare for his role, actor Yuvan bulked up and grew long hair, to resemble a tribal settler from the 18th century.  Release  The film had a low key theatrical release across Tamil Nadu in November 2016. Anupama Subramaniam of the Deccan Chronicle wrote \\"that the director has narrated his story neatly, without much deviation and executed it well\\" adding that \\"Srikanth Deva’s music, cinematography by Yuga and art direction by John Britto aids the narration in a big way, but the graphically generated bulls are tacky\\", while concluding \\"though there are few flaws, nevertheless the film is worth a watch!\\" A reviewer from the Hindustan Times, noted \\"Given the budget constraints of a small independent director, Prakash’s effort is laudable, though one felt disappointed with Yuvan’s wooden performance and Krishna was of course expressively engaging\\".

History  The Whirly-Girls were founded by Jean Ross Howard Phelan, an American helicopter pilot, in 1955. At the time there were so few women with helicopter ratings that the group started with only 13 charter members representing the United States, Germany, and France. The Whirly-Girls provided a community for female helicopter pilots to share interests, remove feelings of isolation, and to come together in annual \\"Hoverings\\" beginning in April 1955. Today the organization has over 1,700 members from 44 different countries.The first member (\\"Whirly-Girl #1\\") was Hanna Reitsch, who flew her helicopter inside Berlin's Deutschlandhalle in 1938.

The organization's logo was inspired by a recruiting show put on by the U.S. Army in the early 1950s. Four helicopters performed a square dance, with a caller on the microphone and a band playing \\"Turkey in the Straw\\". Two of the helicopters were decorated to represent the boys, and the other two represented the girls. The \\"girl\\" helicopters were topped with blonde wigs fashioned from dyed floor mops, and faces were painted on them in the style of Betty Boop. The scholarship program was started in 1968 in memory of Doris Mullen, a former member. It was incorporated in 1974, and became an international program in 1978. The program provides flight training scholarships to eligible women. Phelan received the National Aeronautic Association's Elder Statesman of Aviation Award in 1994.

Viscount of Avranches. Richard’s grandfather was Ansfred the Dane. William the Conqueror, as Duke of Normandy, bestowed on him the title of Viscount of Avranches sometime before 1046. Richard may also have been Lord of Creully and entrusted with the castle of Saint-James-de-Beuvron, built by William in 1067 shortly after the war against the Bretons of 1064-66. Richard provided 60 ships to support William's 1066 invasion of England but is not among those known to have been present at the Battle of Hastings. Between 1070 and 1079, Richard was involved in a ruling between Raoul Tesson and the Abbey of Fontenay. Around 1076 he was one of the judges who pronounced an award against Robert Bertram. Richard married Emma, who is believed to have been the daughter of Herluin de Conteville and Herleva (mistress of Robert I of Normandy and mother of William the Conqueror), and hence a sister of Robert, Count of Mortain (Companion of William) and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. Richard and Emma had five known children and probably more: * Hugh d’Avranches, Earl of Chester and Viscount of Avranches * Helisende, married to William II, Count of Eu * Gilbert d'Avranches, Lord of Marcey * Margaret, married to Ranulf, Viscount du Bessin. Their son was Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester * Judith, married to Richer de l'Aigle (died in the Battle of Saint-Suzanne). Ranulf became Earl of Chester after his cousin Richard d’Avranches died in the White Ship disaster of 1120. Also, Judith and Richer lost two of their grandsons in this tragedy, sons of Gilbert (d. abt 1118) (Godefroi (Godfrey) and Engenulf (Engenouf) de l'Aigle).

History The company was set up as a project of Marshall Bennett, a mahogany trader operating in the region of Belize. From 1834 Juan Galindo was opposing expansion of British wood-cutting interests in the area. Bennett diverted Thomas Gould, who was looking to revive the Poyais venture (in a part of what is now Honduras) towards colonisation based on an 1834 land grant around Vera Paz, in eastern Guatemala. His own aims concerned mahogany to be found in the vicinity of the Rio Dolce. The Guatemalan administration under Mariano Gálvez took a favourable line on colonisation, the Eastern Coast Company produced brochures in 1836, and emigrants from London arrived by boat at Vera Paz that summer. A competing group, based on the investors in the failed Poyais grant, then intervened, having secured a further land grant from Robert Charles Frederic. Thomas Hedgcock, himself interested in mahogany from the Black River area, manipulated the Poyais revival; and the rivalry was expressed in a corporate raid on the Eastern Coast Company in October 1837. From this point onwards third parties were invoked: Francisco Morazán of the Federal Republic of Central America, and the British Colonial Office. The Eastern Coast Company, however, was forced to fall back on a reduced colonisation scheme round Vera Paz. The Black River interests fell to a separate vehicle by 1838. In 1839 Peter Harriss Abbott was brought in to head the Board of the company. He was an accountant, who worked on reform in government financial administration, and an official assignee under the recent bankruptcy legislation. In that year Bennett died. The Eastern Coast Company pursued its colony at \\"Abbottsville\\", which counted 80 colonists, after a shipload of February 1840. The whole area was descending into civil war, however, with Galindo and Morazán being killed. Abbottsville was in poor condition at the end of 1840, and was eventually deserted. Abbott absconded to Brussels in 1841, owing large sums, and was declared bankrupt.

Established in 1788, the farm was operated continuously into the late 20th century by a single family, and includes a well-preserved Greek Revival farmhouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history Sutton Farm is located in a rural area of northeastern Shelburne, on about of land bisected by Dorset Road south of Barstow Road. The main farm complex is set on both sides of Dorset Road, south of Sutton Farm Lane, a residential development built on land historically associated with the farm. Including that development, the farm property is roughly rectangular, with acreage on the west side of the road cultivated, and that on the east side divided between crops, pasture, and hay. Stone walls line some of the boundaries between usages. The farmstead consists of a brick Cape style farmhouse, set on the west side of the road; it was built about 1815 as a plank-framed wood frame structure, and was finished in brick about 1830, at which time its Greek Revival features were also added. Adjacent to the house are a garage of and chicken house, both built in the 1930s, while a long barn and silos, all from the mid-20th century, stand on the east side of the road. with The farm property was acquired in 1788 by Benjamin Sutton, a native of Greenwich, Connecticut. He and his family lived at first in log cabins (built in two separate locations on the property), before this house was built in the mid-1810s. The house is notable for its unusually high kneewall in the upper story, a feature found only in a few surviving homes in northeastern Shelburne, and thus probably the work of a particular local builder. The house was finished in brick, probably when Sutton's son Bryon took over the farm in the 1830s. Sutton descendants continued to farm the property themselves until about 1985, at which time farmers of the adjacent land to the south took over operations.

When WASP was disbanded after World War II, former WASP aviator Marge Hurlburt took up air racing, becoming interested in a new midget class of racing airplanes that had first been proposed before the war: these would be smaller, lighter, and cheaper to build than those then in use and thus suitable for civilian pilots and homebuilders to build and fly. Together with fellow WASP aviators Anna Logan and Duke Caldwell, she formed a consortium to design and build such a plane, which required a stock engine, fixed pitched propeller, and non-retractable landing gear. Known ultimately as the \\"Hurlburt Hurricane\\", their design was powered by an Continental C85 engine. It was sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Continental Motors, and Kendall Motor Oil. The trio moved to Michigan, where the plane was being built, to supervise and to put on the plane's covering themselves. Its registration number was NX1223, with the 'X' designating it as an experimental aircraft. Given entry number 85 in the 1947 Goodyear Trophy Race, a course for midget racers, the trio hoped for Hurlburt to pilot the plane, but she was killed prior to the race when her aircraft crashed at an air show in Iowa. Neither of the other members of the trio was ultimately able to take over because the race remained restricted to male pilots. The Hurlburt Hurricane thus flew with Joe Smith as pilot and was eliminated in the heats. A group of pilots and aviation enthusiasts has formed to make the Hurlburt Hurricane airworthy again. Peanut-scale models of the Hurlburt Hurricane have been built from plans drawn by Dave Livesay.

A prominent and respected Shaker during her long life, she worked to preserve Shaker music. With the help of Daniel Patterson, she recorded Early Shaker Spirituals, a collection of Shaker songs. In recognition of her achievements in the field, in 1983 she received the National Heritage Fellowship. She also co-founded and managed The Shaker Quarterly, a magazine and journal focused on the Shakers, to which she was also a regular contributor.  Biography  = Birth and life at Alfred Village (1897–1931) = Barker was born in Providence, Rhode Island on February 3, 1897. She joined the Shakers on July 7, 1903, when her newly widowed mother placed her under the care of the Alfred village. She was placed into the Second Family, where sister Harriet Coolbroth became a mother figure for Barker. Barker was tasked with assisting the very elderly sister Paulina Springer, whom she befriended. Springer taught Barker the song \\"Mother Has Come with Her Beautiful Song\\". Springer died in 1905, and on her deathbed asked Barker to always remain Shaker, which Barker promised she would do. Barker's inclination to music continued, as Coolbroth and Lucinda Taylor taught her and other girls in her care Shaker songs, and Barker attempted to learn as many of these songs as she could. She later claimed that it was the \\"vim and vigor\\" of Shaker song that attracted her to the faith. She belonged to a club called the \\"Beacon Light Circle\\". Barker's mother returned in 1911 to take her back home to Providence, but Barker insisted on remaining at Alfred to live as a Shaker. Seven years later, she signed the covenant, binding herself as a member of the Alfred community. That same year, the Second Family was closed, and thus Barker relocated to Alfred's Church Family. = Sabbathday Lake (1931–1990) = In 1931, the Alfred community closed, and Barker moved to the Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester, Maine. At Sabbathday Lake, she was placed in charge of the Girls' Order, where she formed the \\"Girls' Improvement Club\\", in which the girls and young women wrote poetry, practiced recitations, and studied the Bible. She also was placed in charge of preserves and candy making – specializing in hand-dipped chocolates – at the village's store, where she also sewed and knitted. She oversaw these industries until 1968. In 1950, she was made trustee of Sabbathday Lake and thus charged with running the businesses and finances for the entire village. Since the 1940s, Barker was de facto spiritual leader for the Sabbathday Lake community. Gertrude Soule, who had left and rejoined the community several times, had been appointed Eldress in 1950, and felt uncomfortable with this level of Barker's influence. In 1957, she was appointed to the Parent Ministry at the Hancock Shaker Village, and so relocated to that Ministry's base in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In 1971, Soules, now living at the Canterbury Shaker Village, decided not to return to Sabbathday Lake, and Barker was appointed Eldress in her stead. In 1960, Theodore Johnson joined the Shakers, and the following year he and Barker launched The Shaker Quarterly, a journal and magazine that published scholarly articles on theology and the Shakers, shared news from the village, and, occasionally, advertised products produced by the community. Barker served as business manager for the publication from its founding until 1974, and frequently contributed articles as well as the regularly occurring newsletter column Home Notes. It was mostly through Barker's leadership that Sabbathday Lake decided to re-open their religious meetings to public attendance. She traveled as a speaker on topics regarding the Shakers. For many years, Barker worked with historian and musicologist Daniel W. Patterson toward preserving Shaker music. She commented that \\"I didn't realize for a very long time how important it was, it was a feeling that I got myself from the old songs, the music. It suddenly came upon me that I was keeping the tradition alive, which meant everything to me. We're just a small group, but it's something that the world needs and I'm sure it's going to pass right down through many centuries. I don't believe that it will be lost.\\" She appeared on four recordings, including Early Shaker Spirituals. In recognition of her contributions to traditional Shaker song, in 1983 Barker was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts. Over the course of her life, she received numerous other awards as well. Barker died on January 25, 1990, after battling cancer for several months.

He was the chief litigant in a case successfully challenging the anti-sodomy laws of Belize and the co-founder of the only LGBT advocacy group in the country. Biography Orozco became politically active when he was 31, after attending a workshop in Belize City for gay men and for people living with HIV. Orozco co-founded the United Belize Advocacy Movement (UNIBAM) in 2006, and later became the president. UNIBAM is the country's only LGBT advocacy group and has been using the legal system to challenge the anti-sodomy laws in Belize. UNIBAM is run out of Orzoco's home. In 2009, Orozco attended an HIV conference in Jamaica where he met two law professors from the University of the West Indies Rights Advocacy Project. The two professors identified Belize as an ideal case for challenging bans on same-sex relationships. In Belize, there was a law that specified a 10-year prison sentence for sodomy. In 2011, Orozco and UNIBAM filed a constitutional case against the law, and challenged section 53 of the criminal code in Belize. The Catholic Church in Belize came out against the filing, which Orozco defended, saying, \\"The case is personal and it's about reminding the system that my human rights isn't about picking and choosing which you'll support and which you will ignore. My human rights is total. It's not to be mandated by the church because the church does not govern this country. Period.\\" Not long after the filing, the church made a successful pretrial motion to remove UNIBAM saying the group had no legal standing, leaving Orozco the sole claimant on the case. Gay people in Belize did not have a legal voice until Orozco filed the case. After filing the challenge, Orozco said there had been an increase in hatred directed at LGBT people in Belize. In February 2012, he was threatened with anti-gay insults and hit in the face with a bottle which required surgery. He also began to get death threats because of his challenge to the anti-sodomy law. Orozco has also had his car damaged by people threatening him. Orozco continued to participate in conferences. He was part of a forum called \\"Realising the Dream of Caribbean LGBT Inclusion\\", given at Ryerson University during the 2014 WorldPride Human Rights conference in Toronto. In May 2013, arguments were made in court about the case. On August 10, 2016, the chief justice ruled Section 53 of the criminal code to be unconstitutional. The law was said \\"to violate Orozco's human dignity, privacy, and (in forcing him to lie or risk prosecution) freedom of expression.\\" Orozco said, \\"This is the first day of my life in which it is legal for me to be me.\\" UNIBAM and Orozco began discussions with Patrick Faber, the Deputy Prime Minister about LGBT representation on the Morality Commission in Belize. In December 2016, he was awarded the David Kato Vision and Voice award.

The IASS employs a transdisciplinary approach that encourages dialogue to understand sustainability issues and generate potential solutions in cooperation with partners from the sciences, politics, the economy, and civil society. A strong network of national and international partners supports the work of the Institute. Its central research topics include the energy transition, emerging technologies, climate change, air quality, systemic risks, governance and participation, and cultures of transformation in the Anthropocene.  Organisation  The IASS currently employs around 120 persons, including Fellows from over 30 countries.IASS Activities 2012–2013, p. 72. In 2019 the Board of Directors was composed of the Institute's three Scientific Directors – Mark G. Lawrence, Patrizia Nanz and Ortwin Renn – and its Head of Administration, Jakob Meyer. The IASS receives funding from the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (85%) and the Federal State of Brandenburg (15%). The Institute's research programme currently spans five areas: Democratic Transformations; Systemic Interdependencies: Nature, Technology, Society; Perceptions, Values, Orientation; Energy Systems and Societal Change; Governance for the Environment and Society. These research areas are supported in their work by a cross-cutting research area tasked with facilitating dialogue between science, policy-makers, and civil society actors. The IASS is a registered voluntary association under German law. The Institute's supervisory, governing, and advisory bodies are its General Assembly, Board of Directors and Advisory Board.  History  The IASS was founded in Potsdam, Germany, on 2 February 2009. German politician and environmental policy expert Klaus Töpfer was the Institute's founding director. He led the Institute as its executive director until September 2015, together with scientific directors Carlo Rubbia (June 2010 – May 2015) and Mark G. Lawrence (from October 2011). At a founding symposium held under the patronage of Angela Merkel, the then Federal Minister of Education and Research Annette Schavan stated: \\"Under Professor Töpfer's leadership, the Institute will be able to gain international prominence and underscore Germany's strong position in this field.\\" The idea for the IASS was born in 2007 at the Potsdam Nobel Laureate Symposium \\"Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause\\". The symposium brought together leading researchers and decision-makers and resulted in the publication of the widely regarded Potsdam Memorandum, which called for a concerted effort to tap into \\"all sources of ingenuity\\" to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The memorandum urged the establishment of a new \\"global contract\\" between science and society to bring together relevant knowledge within and beyond the science system to meet challenges to sustainability arising in the Anthropocene.  Publications  The IASS uses a number of publications formats to disseminate its findings and policy recommendations. These include: * IASS Policy Briefs – Policy recommendations and assessments * IASS Fact Sheets – Brief overviews of research relating to topics addressed by the Institute * IASS Studies – Detailed research findings addressing a central issue * IASS Working Paper – Interim research findings and interventions in current debates Other publication formats include articles in scholarly journals, statements, monograhs, and edited volumes. The institute also hosts a blog on its website.  Cooperation  The IASS collaborates with numerous partners in Germany and abroad. Its major regional partners include the University of Potsdam, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, a research centre operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

In 1967 the Public Auction Yards hosted an event to showcase the region’s vast livestock industry. By the fall of 1968, a full-fledged livestock show with 250 exhibitors and 600 entries was underway. The first NILE consisted of livestock shows, horse shows, and rodeo and today those traditions continue as the NILE Stock Show and ProRodeo has become one of the largest agricultural events of the Northwest. Sign outside of NILE office in Billings, Montana Through the years the NILE Stock Show has always been a show with some of the purest and most influential genetics in the world. The NILE is host to several national cattle breed shows and sales. Additionally, the NILE Gold Buckle Select Horse Sales features a weanling/yearling sale, performance horse sale, as well as six different futurities. The NILE ProRodeo is Montana’s most prestigious rodeos. As one of the first rodeos of the qualifying year, the NILE consistently showcases many of the top contestants in the PRCA. In 2006, the NILE added a Ranch Rodeo to their fall event. The popularity of this event and the essence of displaying real American ranch cowboys in this type of event quickly spread across the region. In 2009 the NILE Ranch Rodeo Finals was established in which winning teams from NILE sanctioned Ranch Rodeos from across the region came to compete for the top honor of being the NILE series champion team. The winning team is also eligible to compete in the Western States Ranch Rodeo Association Finals held in Winnemucca, NV Since the NILE’s inception, it has grown to incorporate a variety of other events, like hosting the Professional Bull Riders each year in April. The NILE has been the host of the longest running event stop of the elite PBR Built FORD Tough Series. In 2008, the NILE purchased the Montana Agri-Trade Exposition (MATE Show) held annually the third week of February each year. A large focus has been placed on programs to encourage youth participation like the Merit Heifer Program, Jr. Fed Show and Sale, Jr. Breeding Cattle Shows, Youth Judging Contests, school assemblies, and an agricultural education program for over 2,000 area 4th graders. The first NILE was funded much the way it is funded today – through memberships from businesses, ranchers, and other supporters as well as sponsorships from corporate partners. The NILE is dedicated to the promotion of livestock production, agricultural education, and respect for our western tradition. We believe those are important for the future of agriculture. NILE is a non-profit organization, 501(c)5, dedicated to the promotion of livestock, agriculture education and respect for the western culture. The first president of the NILE Board of Directors was the great cattleman Pat Goggins. The first General Manager of the NILE was Conrad Burns.

From 2013 to 2016 he was the keyboard player for the band Save Ferris. Early life Alexander was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Laguna Beach and Irvine, California with his parents who are both vested in the arts (his father is a well-respected painter and his mother was an art gallery curator before becoming a therapist). His grandmother, Flora Burke, was an accomplished actress (and an early inspiration to Alexander). Alexander always had a passion for music (he was considered a vibraphone prodigy) and while in high school joined Drake Bell’s band Drake 24/7 and went on to perform on the Amanda Show at the Palladium and other high-profile venues around LA and on TV. After high school, he went to Columbia College Chicago, where he became the youngest musical director for the renowned Second City. Alexander was asked to be the musical director for “iO Theater 25 Anniversary Concert DVD” that included performances by Mike Myers, Amy Poehler, Tim Meadows, Andy Dick, Andy Richter and Rich Talarico (Rich later hired Alexander to be the composer of Frank TV on TBS – which would be his first TV gig). While in Chicago he was also busy doing jazz gigs with musicians such as Von Freeman and Chuck Hedges. Career After graduating from Columbia College Alexander moved back to Los Angeles, where he studied at the University of Southern California’s film- scoring post-baccalaureate program. After graduation, he quickly found work in television (being hired as part of the house band for the television pilot for Robert Townsend’s talk show “Night of Townsend” on TBS) where he met Eban Schletter (the composer of “Sponge Bob Square Pants”) and Grant-Lee Phillips (who was also part of the house band) and that relationship led to Alexander playing in Phillips' band.

During this time, Alexander became friends with Monique Powell (the lead singer of the band Save Ferris) through his neighbor Abby Travis (the bass player for The Bangles) and ended up playing on records for both of them and later joining the band Save Ferris. Alexander was a member of Save Ferris when they opened for Gwen Stefani at Irvine Meadows and for Mexico City's infamous Ska Festival. He has also done behind-the-scenes music work, such as being the musical director on the MTV Movie Awards, and co-producing Ben Lee's album Freedom, and the first two Garfunkel and Oates albums. He co- wrote the songs \\"Back to the Start\\" for the Iron Man 3 soundtrack, the song \\"Love You Like This\\" for the Jason Bateman movie The Gift, the song \\"Undercover\\" for the TV series New Girl, the theme song for the Broadway Video series 7 Minutes in Heaven, and the score for the 2017 documentary film Haunters: The Art of the Scare (as well as serving as its music supervisor). He played keyboards on Kate Pierson's album Guitars and Microphones, played piano and mandolin on the Billy Ray Cyrus albums Change My Mind and Thin Line (performing with Cyrus live at the Grand Ole Opry, The Tonight Show and at NASCAR to a crowd of over 80,000), played piano on the Dionne Warwick record Feels So Good, performed live with Gary Numan for a “Die Hard” commercial, recorded the double platinum selling Dane Cook album Isolated Incident, accompanied Thomas Middleditch, Ed Helms and Michael Bublé for Bublé's Xmas special, played multiple instruments on Margaret Cho's Grammy nominated musical comedy album Cho Dependent, played synth bass on the David Lynch/Chrysta Bell album This Train, and played with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings on the Matthew McConaughey led Lincoln television commercial. Alexander is also an actor, improv coach with Killian Mchugh's Commercial Improv Class and has starred in two television pilots: Hardin High for MTV2 and the Scott Thompson (Kids in the Hall)-produced Husk Report. Alexander also produced the American version of the Japanese anime series Skip Beat for 25 episodes as well as starred as the voice of Sho Devil and was produced by his corporation “Flip the Cat Productions.” Currently, Alexander is busy with his band Magnolia Memoir, which he writes for and plays the keyboards along with Mela Lee who is the lead singer and co-writer. The video for their single “Odds and Ends” (from the album Pale Fire) has celebrity cameos from Will Forte, Doris Roberts, Fred Willard and Jorge Garcia. Magnolia Memoir has released four albums so far. Alexander is also scoring the Netflix TV series A Mortified Guide, composed two songs for the Sharon Stone film As I Wish and is co- writing (with children's book author Richard Fairgray) a children's book and animated short titled Sweet Penny and the Lion (with music for the short performed by Jill Sobule).

Caine was a four-masted wooden schooner built by Seattle shipbuilder Moran Brothers in 1900. One of the schooner's initial short-term co-owners, Elmer Caine, named her after his wife Minnie. From 1900 to 1926, the schooner was operated out of San Francisco by Charles Nelson Co., one of the largest transporter of lumber in United States at the time. The schooner transported lumber across the Pacific Ocean from the Pacific Northwest to ports of Australia and Americas, but after 1920 her scope of operations became limited to West Coast lumber trade. By 1926, the company no longer could run a sailing ship with profit, and the Minnie A. Caine was moored in boneyard in California. In 1931 the schooner was purchased by Olaf C. Olsen who turned it to an unrigged fishing barge, operating off the Santa Monica Pier. In eight years, after a severe storm in September 1939, the Minnie A. Caine was grounded in Santa Monica Bay. Three months later, her wreckage became a threat to a California highway and had to be incinerated. Cabin clock of Minnie A. Caine is preserved on the in San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. The schooner became widely known for a series of incidents that she endured and immortalized by her portrayal in literature. Twice in her career, the Minnie A. Caine suffered damage that amounted to 50% of her cost, but was successfully salvaged. The salvage operation after her grounding in 1901 lasted three months and was featured in Scientific American. The fire that almost destroyed the schooner in 1917 in Adelaide inspired fiction stories of Peter Kyne, Joan Lowell, and Corey Ford. In particular, The Cradle of the Deep, an autobiography written by a silent movie actress, Joan Lowell, in March 1929, became a national bestseller that topped non-fiction part of The New York Times Best Seller list. The autobiography purported that Lowell spent her childhood on the Minnie A. Caine and provided details about many unusual and frightening experiences. It was soon discovered that the autobiography was a hoax, which led to a nationwide literary scandal. Later in the year, Corey Ford published Salt Water Taffy — a parody on The Cradle of the Deep that in turn, also became a bestseller.  Construction  Minnie A. Caine's launch from Moran Brothers' dock The Minnie A. Caine was laid down in Seattle in December 1899. At the time, Seattle benefited from the early years of Nome Gold Rush which propelled Seattle, then a small town, to its later prosperity. One of the beneficiaries of the rush was a Seattle citizen and a future millionaire Elmer Caine who made his starting capital transporting eager new colonists from Seattle to Nome and other Alaskan ports, thus rising from a captain of a small steamer and a ticket agent to a prominent shipowner. In 1899, aiming to diversify his shipping interests and maximize his profits, Caine ordered several vessels simultaneously with the intent to finance them in partnerships with other shipowners. Unlike the other ships that were built to service coastal Alaskan routes, the Minnie A. Caine was designed for long- distance lumber trade. Caine named the vessel after his wife Minnie; however, Caine owned approximately ⅓ of the Minnie A. Caine, as ½ belonged to Charles Nelson Co., a San Francisco shipping company which specialized in lumber trade, and the remaining ⅙ to local Caine's associates from Seattle. The Minnie A. Caine was the first sailing ship constructed by Seattle shipbuilding company Moran Brothers which generally specialized in steam-powered vessels. One worker died during the ship construction when the scaffolding collapsed in May 1900. The vessel's price was $55,000. The construction was supervised by George Monk, Ed Monk's father. On October 6, 1900 at 2:30 pm, in front of three thousand spectators, the Minnie A. Caine was launched broadside, creating a spectacular splash. The same day the vessel was christened by Nellie Moran, Robert Moran's daughter.  Specifications  The Minnie A. Caine was a wooden single-deck four-masted schooner with two tiers of beams. She was long, wide and deep, and designed to be operated by a crew of ten. All four masts were equipped with topmasts; the foremast was outfitted with a single yard and a square sail. The schooner could hold up to of lumber (1,000 M), and up to 30% of the load could be placed on deck that was constructed with a minimum of fixtures and equipment. She was equipped with bow and stern ports to facilitate lumber loading and unloading operations.  History of voyages  = Lumber trade 1900–1919 = Since her launch, the Minnie A. Caine was involved in transpacific lumber trade. She typically carried a full load of lumber from Washington state or British Columbia to ports of Australia, Hawaii, Mexico, Chile, or Peru. Until the late 1910s, the economics of transpacific lumber trade heavily depended on the payment opportunities for return cargoes which typically included a load of coal from Newcastle, Australia to Honolulu where coal was in demand for the local sugar industry, followed by a load of sugar for San Francisco. Alternatively, a load of coal could be taken from Australia all the way to the Pacific Northwest; for example, in 1907 the Minnie A. Caine has brought coal to Nanaimo, British Columbia and loaded her next cargo of lumber in the same port. The route Seattle–Sydney–Newcastle–Honolulu–San Francisco–Seattle was the Minnie A. Caine's most typical cyclic voyage. On average, this route took her 9 months, as a one-way trip to Australia lasted approximately three months, loading and unloading process was complicated, so docking could take weeks, and the schooner often waited for the cargo for the return trip. This route was also the Minnie A. Caine's maiden voyage, and she was scheduled to leave Puget Sound for Sydney on October 25, 1900. From the day of the launch, the Minnie A. Caine's captain was J. K. Olsen. Although initially, the Minnie A. Caine operated under multiple owners, by 1903 Charles Nelson Co. has consolidated the ownership of the schooner and re-registered her to the port of San Francisco. The company operated multiple vessels, and was growing to become one of the largest transporter of lumber in the United States.  Grounding of 1901  The Minnie A. Caine did not return to Seattle after her first voyage until December 23, 1901, because she was delayed in San Francisco port by the \\"strike trouble\\" there. Her next assignment was to pick up a load of lumber from Chemainus, a logging town in British Columbia, and to deliver it to Callao, the main port in Peru. The schooner left Port Townsend, Washington on December 24, 1901. As it was supposed to pass Haro Strait and the narrow straits around Salt Spring Island, Minnie A. Caine was pulled by the small -ton tug Magic. At Christmas Eve, as the coupling was passing by Victoria in the northeastern part of Strait of Juan de Fuca, it encountered a severe storm that covered the entire area and was described as \\"the worst storm seen in many years.\\" The roll of the larger vessel — the Minnie A. Caine — soon reached the critical amplitude, and at 2 a.m. the hawser had to be severed to save the Magic from overturning. The steam-powered Magic managed to reach Port Townsend safely, pouring machine oil around herself to \\"keep the seas down\\". Minnie A. Caine's crew \\"heroically\\" attempted to sail through the storm, but the gale gradually ripped all her sails, and the schooner ended up thrown ashore on the northwestern rocky beach of Smith Island. The crew was safe and found refuge inside Smith Island lighthouse. Subsequent inspection of the schooner revealed damage to her bottom, and she was generally believed to be lost completely. At the time, the cost of the vessel was estimated higher than its original price: from $60,000 to $65,000.  Salvage operation of 1902  Minnie A. Caine stranded on Smith Island. It turned out that only Elmer Caine's share of the schooner was covered by insurance (in the amount of $17,500). Charles Nelson's largest share was uninsured, and he sent his nephew, James Tyson, to investigate the possibility of salvage to avoid $35,000 loss. Parties learned that the damage to the ship itself was not as severe as originally feared, but re-launching the vessel into the water was problematic. Charles Nelson Company and the Caine's insurance underwriters joined forces to organize the salvage, but all offered bids were too high. Finally, the parties agreed that Robert Moran of Moran Brothers would attempt the salvage. The operation was led by Moran's employee, captain Klitgaard. The salvage became \\"widely followed,\\" its details being featured in Scientific American. The operation was complicated by the remote location of the wreck site, as all supplies including fresh water had to be delivered from Port Townsend. Caine allocated one of his ships, the tug Wallowa to assist with transportation. The tug transported surviving fittings (including the removed topmasts) from Smith Island and transported the supplies to host and feed the forty people involved in the operation. The actual salvage started in February 1902. The forty workers used heavy timber to construct skids to direct the schooner into the water and used hydraulic jackscrews to dislodge her from the sand onto the skids, while the Wallowa's engines were used to pull the Minnie A. Caine towards the water. The schooner was moved 45 feet, but procedure had to be restarted in April, as a March storm destroyed weeks of work, pushing the schooner where it originally was. Finally, the vessel was dragged 85 feet towards the water, and the Wallowa was making the final pull, but her power was insufficient to drag the schooner into the water. On May 4, a more powerful tug Tyee from Puget Sound Tug Boat Co. was chartered, but only after simultaneous application of two tugs — the Tyee and the Tacoma on May 9, 1902, the Minnie A. Caine was finally afloat. The schooner was tugged to Moran Brothers' dock in Seattle where it was undergoing repairs until making a voyage to San Francisco in September 1902. The salvage operation ended up costing almost $20,000 with subsequent repairs at Moran's costing additional $10,000 which amounted to almost half of the vessel's value. Due to the imbalance in financing of the salvage operation caused by Elmer Caine's using his tug and men, by the end of the salvage, he ended up owning 50% share of the vessel. However, by 1903 Elmer Caine sold his share to Charles Nelson Co. which became the Minnie A. Caine sole owner.  Incidents of 1906–1909  During one of the voyages from Washington state to San Francisco in November 1906, Minnie A. Caine saved the crew of another San Franciscan schooner — the Emma Caudina — that was wrecked off Grays Harbor. Three years later, on December 27, 1909, Minnie A. Caine itself barely reached Grays Harbor in miserable condition after encountering a typhoon. The schooner was sailing from Haiphong, French Indochina to Bellingham, Washington, and the typhoon had carried away all her sails and destroyed most of her provisions. The crew was suffering from severe hunger, and captain J.K. Olsen became stricken with heart disease and on arrival was taken to Hoquiam hospital in critical condition. G. Nelson became the Minnie A. Caine's new captain.  Australian incidents of 1917–1918  Minnie A. Caine half-sunk in Port Adelaide after the fire. For the 1917 voyage to Australia, captain G. Nelson was replaced by captain Nicholas Wagner. On August 19, 1917, Minnie A. Caine arrived at Port Adelaide with of lumber. Unloading was scheduled to finish at the Corporation Wharf by September 4; however, at 6:30 p.m. on September 3, a fire erupted in the schooner's lower hold. The danger was further exacerbated by the schooner's additional load of of gasoline. The captain's wife with their three children who were on board made a hasty escape to a nearby hotel, while the port's Fire Brigade and the reinforcements from the city, the captain, and a few crew members who remained on the ship fought the fire. The load of gasoline was safely jettisoned, but the fire was not contained until 10 p.m. when the firefighters got assistance from the heavy rain. From all the water poured in, the schooner eventually half-sunk, her masts resting on the surface of the wharf. The fire \\"almost completely destroyed the ship.\\" The rapid progress of the fire from a section used to store sails raised suspicions of an arson. A special inquiry into the cause of the fire was held on September 20, but \\"it was not considered desirable to disclose\\" its findings to the public. The schooner was moved to a dry dock of A. McFarlane & Sons in Birkenhead to assess the damage. The fire area was , spanning deep. Sternpost, poop deck, and a number of knees in the aft section needed to be replaced completely. The knee replacement was of particular concern, as at the time, there was no sufficiently large timber available in Australia, which raised doubts if the schooner could possibly be repaired in Adelaide. Despite all the difficulties, A. McFarlane & Sons repaired the schooner \\"satisfactorily\\" by January, 1918, although test runs and fixing of residual leakage continued until March. The overall cost of the repairs was 5,500 Australian pounds (US$25,795). The Minnie A. Caine was unable to leave Adelaide in March, however, because she became the first ship arrested in the port in years on the charge of not settling a 42-Australian-pound ship-survey account. The case went to Australian Admiralty Court, which eventually cleared the schooner and its captain of the charge. Minnie A. Caine's ordeal in Adelaide finally ended on June 19, 1918 when the schooner sailed off to San Francisco. By that time, one of the captain's sons was old enough to marry a local girl from Semaphore neighborhood of Adelaide. = Lumber trade 1920–1926 = After World War I, the economics of transpacific lumber trade changed. On one hand, the evolution in shipbuilding gave the advantage to steam-powered vessels, thus gradually rendering the concept of a sailing lumber schooner archaic. The building of sailing ships effectively ceased after 1905, and moreover, the end of the World War I has flooded the ship market with a fleet of steamers no longer needed for hostilities. On the other hand, Hawaiian sugar industry has switched from coal to oil, and it was less and less profitable to carry coal as a return cargo from Australia. By 1921, Charles Nelson Co. was one of the largest lumber trading companies in United States. However, unlike most of its competitors, it didn't get rid of its sailing vessels prior to World War I. In the conditions of the changed economy, the company transferred its lumber schooners from transpacific lumber trade to West Coast lumber trade, to delivering lumber from the Pacific Northwest to San Francisco. Moreover, the schooners were no longer sailing this route; instead, they were tugged along the coast by a steam schooner also loaded with lumber or by a tug. This approach permitted the operation of schooners with a minimal crew of less experienced sailors, thus saving money on wages and keeping the transport rates down. By 1919, captain J. K. Olsen returned to command of the Minnie A. Caine, and the schooner began a cycle of tug-assisted voyages mainly from Port Angeles or Mukilteo in Washington State to San Francisco and occasionally as far as Mexico. By 1923, the Minnie A. Caine was the last sailing vessel that Charles Nelson Co. operated. By 1926, even this method of lumber transport became unprofitable, and after her last voyage from Port Angeles, the schooner arrived to San Francisco on August 8, 1926 for her last unloading; she was later towed to the boneyard in Alameda, California. = Fishing barge = By 1931, strained by the Great Depression, Charles Nelson Co. was actively selling unneeded vessels. On the other hand, captain Olaf C. Olsen, a \\"square- jawed Norwegian\\" sailor and one of many Pacific Coast sailors who used to be involved in West Coast lumber trade discovered business opportunity in operating a fishing barge. Since 1925 he successfully operated the bark Narwhal in this capacity and formed Malibu Maritime Corporation. After selling the Narwhal to a film studio, in April 1931 Olaf C. Olsen purchased the Minnie A. Caine to turn it to a fishing barge operating off the Santa Monica Pier. The schooner was tugged along California coast from the boneyard in Alameda, California to San Pedro where her masts were cut off. She was subsequently reclassified as \\"barge\\" with a crew of two and registered to Malibu Maritime Corporation, home port — Los Angeles In May 1931, the Minnie A. Caine was anchored for the summer in Santa Monica Bay, not far from the Santa Monica Pier. For the next eight years, the Minnie A. Caine spent summers anchored in the bay, and captain Olaf C. Olsen operated a small boat which would bring fishermen to his barge. The ticket was 50 cents, and during the depression years, a kid could fish on the Minnie A. Caine for a full day and bring home enough fish to sell it for spending money for a couple of weeks and the next ticket. On the other hand, it was rumored that at night, \\"merry\\" parties were held on the vessel where alcohol was served. A piano was also delivered to Minnie A. Caine for entertainment. During the winter months, the former schooner was moored off the docks in San Pedro.  Grounding of 1939  During the night of September 24, 1939 after unprecedentedly hot summer, Santa Monica Bay was hit by a severe storm, gales reaching . At the time, captain Olaf A. Olsen, five other crew members were on board together with an unidentified number of guests. Anchored at the bay, the Minnie A. Caine was riding out the storm six miles off the Santa Monica Pier. When the old anchor chain failed the crew was too slow to cast the spare anchor, and the former schooner was thrown onto the shore at by the intersection of Sunset boulevard and then Roosevelt Highway (now Pacific Coast Highway, part of California State Route 1). All guests and the six crew members were safe. The guests were transported ashore by small boats before the worst of the storm hit, but the crew members later that night had to be rescued by the Coast Guard. On the next day, after a futile attempt to free the vessel with tugs, the crew discovered serious damage to her keel. The Minnie A. Caine was written off as total loss and eventually abandoned. During the next several weeks, the grounded vessel was an amusement for the local residents who drove north of downtown of Santa Monica to observe the wreckage.  The grounding fallout  Roosevelt Highway damage caused by the presence of the wreckage in the Santa Monica Bay. Charred remains of the Minnie A. Caine, December 24, 1939 Three months after her wreck, the Minnie A. Caine created new problems for the city of Santa Monica and California Highway Commission. A sandbank quickly formed, connecting the grounded vessel to the shore and disturbing the intricate flow of currents inside the Santa Monica Bay. As a result, the ocean waves started battering and cutting into the section of California State Route 1. By December 1939, of berm were washed off, causing the erosion of the roadway itself. As an emergency measure, 500 tons of riprap was dumped along the highway, and one last attempt was made to free the vessel. After the attempt proved unsuccessful, a call to locals was made through the papers to salvage the wreckage for timber. When this produced little results the decision was made to burn the wreckage, and captain Olaf C. Olsen signed abandonment papers. While the engineers prepared the burn, additional 500 tons of riprap was dumped along the damaged portion of the highway. After pouring of fuel oil and gasoline over the Minnie A. Caine, the highway engineers set her on fire at 1 a.m. on December 22, 1939. Many Santa Monica residents gathered to observe the fire. The fire continued through the next day, and it soon became apparent that additional fuel is needed to ensure that the ship's water-soaked hull will burn. On December 23, of crude oil were added to the fire, followed by additional of oil later in the day. By December 24, the fire was out, but the portion of the vessel still remained stuck the sand. The engineers feared that the remaining portion of the ship will continue the disruption of the currents, and suggested to finish the destruction by explosives. This measure, however, was protested by the concerned local residents who feared that an explosion might trigger landslides and damage to their properties. Eventually, the tides broke off the remaining wreckage during the next month, and the threat to the highway was eliminated.  In popular culture  = The Cradle of the Deep = Joan Lowell As the Minnie A. Caine was moored in the boneyard in California, in March 1929, Simon & Schuster published an autobiography of Joan Lowell, a silent movie actress whose largest accomplishment was a small role in Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush. Titled The Cradle of the Deep, the autobiography portrayed the first seventeen years of Lowell's life spent on the Minnie A. Caine. According to the book, Lowell was the captain's daughter who was taken on the schooner when she was just 11 months old and who spent her next 17 years barefoot on the ship in the company of her father and the all-male crew. Peppered with \\"salty cuss words\\" and \\"mildly sexy\\" scenes, the book was considered controversial at the time which added to its popularity. The biography purports that the Minnie A. Caine belonged to Lowell's father and made most of her voyages in the South Pacific. The story is a mix of strange episodes and frightening experiences that included observing a dance of virgins on Atafu, Lowell's playing strip poker with the crew, Lowell's father dissipating a waterspout with rifle shots, near death experience when Lowell and all the crew was stricken with scurvy, and finally, the ship's conflagration and sinking in Australia followed by Lowell's swim to the safety of a lighthouse. The book received multiple positive reviews from different sources, including The Washington Post, Time, Life, Los Angeles Times, etc. Moreover, in the era when book clubs functioned as the most important distribution channel for printed books, in March 1929, The Cradle of the Deep was voted the book of the month by the jury of the highly influential Book of the Month Club. The book soon became a bestseller, topping the non-fiction part of The New York Times Best Seller list. Just one month later, The Cradle of the Deep was exposed as a hoax as Lowell's school records from Berkeley, California were produced which proved that she hadn't spent her life at sea, and the Minnie A. Caine itself was found unscathed in the Alameda's boneyard. Joan Lowell's real name turned out to be Helen Joan Wagner, and at the age of 15, together with her mother and two brothers, she indeed accompanied her father Nicholas Wagner on his one- year assignment as the captain of the Minnie A. Caine on the schooner's unlucky voyage to Australia in 1917–1918. The exposure led to a literary scandal of \\"an astonishing magnitude\\" that echoed across all United States which was further exacerbated by the fact that the hoax was motivated by profit-seeking and that neither Lowell, nor the publishers ever admitted the forgery. Book of the Month Club offered refunds to its subscribers, and The Cradle of the Deep soon ended up on bookstore shelves for discounted books.  Salt Water Taffy  Such a big scandal The Cradle of the Deep hoax had caused that in just three months after the exposure, American humorist Corey Ford published a parody of Lowell's fake autobiography. Titled Salt water taffy; or, Twenty thousand leagues away from the sea; the almost incredible autobiography of Capt. Ezra Triplett's seafaring daughter, by June Triplett, the parody was published under pseudonym \\"June Triplett\\" and dedicated to Corey Ford. The book is a \\"witty, well-written inversion of The Cradle of the Deep\\" where Ford effectively using parodist's tools — inversion and amplification — to expose the absurdity of the Lowell's book. In Salt Water Taffy, Lowell is inverted into a \\"vain and naïve heroine.\\" The ship's name is purposely distorted throughout the book, and different characters from chapter to chapter refer to it as the Carrie L. Maine, the Minnie J. Cohan, the Minnie I. Cohen etc. The parody was a great success, as Salt Water Taffy itself became a bestseller eventually surpassing the sales of The Cradle of the Deep. = Cappy Ricks and Popeye = The eventful life of the Minnie A. Caine, including the fire in Adelaide on September 3, 1917, was an inspiration for some of Peter Kyne's Cappy Ricks stories and the subsequent silent movie Cappy Ricks shot in 1921 by Paramount Pictures. A number of authors have claimed that captain Olaf C. Olsen when he was operating the Narwhal and the Minnie A. Caine as fishing barges of the Santa Monica Pier became the prototype and the inspiration for the cartoon character Popeye which was created by American cartoonist E. C. Segar. However, there is an alternative theory which states that Popeye was inspired by Rocky Fiegel from Chester, Illinois.  Aftermath  Elmer Caine, the Minnie A. Caine ordering customer, died early and unexpectedly in 1908 leaving his wife Minnie Caine with estate of over $1 million. She survived her husband by 14 years, dying in San Francisco in 1922 when the Minnie A. Caine was still carrying lumber throughout the Pacific and didn't live to see her name twisted in the Corey Ford's parody. Moran Brothers built only one more sailing ship — the barkentine James Johnson. The company failed during World War I and in 1916 was purchased by Todd Shipyards Corporation. Charles Nelson Co. over-expanded and failed during the Depression years. On the other hand, A. McFarlane & Sons which repaired the Minnie A. Caine after the fire in Adelaide still existed as of 2013, and the fourth generation of McFarlanes was building and repairing sailing yachts. Captain Olaf C. Olsen died in Santa Monica in 1950 at the age of seventy. While the Minnie A. Caine was moored in the boneyard it was occasionally scrapped for parts. Her only life boat ended up on the four-masted steel barque Moshulu which was also briefly owned by Charles Nelson Co., and as late as 1947 the boat was still seen on the barque, displaying the name of its original ship. The cabin clock from the Minnie A. Caine ended up installed on the three- masted schooner , and was still intact in 1958 when the schooner made its last voyage and was preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Joan Lowell suffered social and financial disappointment when the authenticity of her autobiography was debunked. She unsuccessfully attempted other literary endeavors, and ended up leaving for an exile in Brazil where she died in 1967. As of 2012, The Cradle of the Deep is still remembered as one of \\"the greatest hoaxes of all times\\" and Joan Lowell as a \\"grandmother of literary hoaxes.\\" Nevertheless, her fraudulent autobiography is said to have immortalized the Minnie A. Caine.
