She challenged the finger-centric approach of much classical piano teaching and instead advocated a holistic attitude in which the arm and torso are the conductors of a musical image conceived first in the mind. Life Whiteside majored in music at the University of South Dakota. After a period spent teaching at the University of Oregon, she studied in Germany with Rudolf Ganz. On returning to the United States and teaching first in Oregon and then New York City, she slowly developed the ideas for which she became known. Ideas The catalyst for the development of Whiteside's philosophy was the realisation that, as she wrote, \\"...the pupils in my studio played or didn't play, and that was that. The talented ones progressed, the others didn't--and I could do nothing about it.\\" Whiteside, Abbey. (1969). Indispensables of Piano Playing-Mastering the Chopin Etudes and other essays (2nd ed.). New York: C. Scribner's Sons. p.ix Whiteside praised the natural ability of the child prodigy and the jazz pianist, and sought to understand how an untutored technique could be capable of virtuosity. One of her teaching principles stemming from that view was that piano pieces must be assimilated not so much as muscle memory, but as an intrinsic memory of musical content. One of her pedagogical devices to achieve this was to practice works in different keys, or cross-handed, even simultaneously cross-handed in different keys. Then, upon returning to the correct key, hand positions, and tempo, many of the previous problems in technique had been overcome. Another important device‚Äîused especially in the correct tempo of the piece, no matter how fast‚Äîis what she calls \\"outlining\\": skipping notes provided that the basic rhythm and body dynamics of motion were maintained. (Her term \\"basic rhythm\\" is explored below.) The pianist uses these techniques to establish the musical content as firmly in the mind as possible, replacing note-to-note technical concentration‚Äîand the attendant note-to-note musical attention‚Äîwith accomplishment of the larger musical phrase. In \\"Indispensables of Piano Playing\\" Whiteside describes a fulcrum system that a pianist uses for effective playing. She states that the finger is the fulcrum of the wrist, the wrist the fulcrum of the forearm, the forearm the fulcrum of the upper arm, the upper arm the fulcrum of the shoulder, and the shoulder the fulcrum of the upper body. Whiteside believed all these parts needed to act as one in order to produce good sound and the soul was the chief operator of this system. In her view, fingers are almost useless as agents of either direction or force. Although they might be tutored with much patience to achieve a certain level of dexterity, they possess only limited strength and movement. Indeed, the fourth finger in particular possesses very little of either. Instead, Whiteside advocated the use of the humerus as the principal force for producing a tone at the piano‚Äîthe shoulder joint, being simultaneously powerful and subtle, is more than capable of doing all the work of any individual finger, and moreover is capable of maneuvering any finger into the optimum position such that a simple downward arm movement is required to sound a note. Thus \\"weak\\" fingers (i.e., the fourth finger) are not weak if they are driven by the force of the arm, and exercises to develop their \\"strength\\" are a waste of time. More than even the arm, however, Whiteside advocated the concept of a basic rhythm‚Äîa somewhat specialized term in her writings which indicated an innate sense of phrasing present in all but the most unmusical humans. This rhythm informs every action involved in producing a musical phrase, with the torso, humerus, forearm, wrist and fingers forming a single mechanism to express it. Thus, trying to create a completely independent finger technique is inhibitive to the unified expression of a musical phrase and only encourages what she called \\"note-wise procedure\\"‚Äîconceiving music as a sequence of unconnected pitches rather than as a whole. Whiteside considered the Chopin √âtudes to be the exact point at which a finger-based technique broke down‚Äîonly a technique which used the arm to direct the phrases conceived in the brain could even approach them. She was utterly dismissive of the exercises of Czerny and Hanon, writing: \\"Hanon is used for developing independent fingers with equal hitting power. Obviously this cannot be accomplished. Each finger may gain more power, but there will still be inequality in the fingers. Fingers need to be only expert in transmitting the power of the arm.\\" Whiteside's sense of muscular use is partly along the lines of the Alexander technique; perhaps the best-known and best-formalized modern school was founded by Dorothy Taubman.The Taubman Approach (Taubman's method is now being carried forward by the Golandsky Institute.) Criticism In spite of the remarkable results Whiteside achieved with her own pupils (many of whom were far from promising when beginning lessons with her), a technique based on independence of the fingers continues to be widely taught; although the notion is now widespread that an effective arm technique is essential to fluent playing and avoiding repetitive strain injury, few teachers have been willing to entirely abandon the concept of finger drilling. Critics have pointed out that only one of Whiteside's pupils, Robert Helps, became known as a concert virtuoso. The same charge could be levelled at an influential contemporary in England, Tobias Matthay, whose only single noted pupil was Myra Hess (actually not true, there were plenty more, like Moura Lympani amongst others). Where some argue that her case is not helped by the inadequacies of her prose style (it has been described as convoluted, unclear, repetitious and poorly structured), a comparison with Matthay reveals that her books are far superior in clarity of prose - she was in any case first and foremost a teacher rather than a writer. The fact that she taught privately would have reduced her chances of having 'concert pianist material' students, since they would almost always prefer to study at a conservatoire. Many great pianists and pedagogues had few if any famous pupils, from Chopin to Dinu Lipatti - they were offering training in authentic pianism, which is often somewhat at odds against the superficial acrobatics of the contemporary concert scene as typified by Lang Lang. Favourable testimonials from adult learners who have read her books are widespread. A recurring theme is that the very same Chopin √âtudes on which she based so much of her teaching had been a stumbling-block until her methods were applied. (It might also have some relevance that Chopin himself is reported to have opposed this idea of equalizing the fingers, which was beginning to catch on in his time.)Eigeldinger, Jean-Jacques: \\"Chopin: pianist and teacher.\\" Cambridge University Press, 1986. Legacy In addition to Robert Helps, two of Whiteside's pupils became noted teachers in their own right: Joseph Prostakoff, who taught the noted jazz pianist and educator Barry Harris, and Sophia Rosoff, who taught Harris as well as jazz pianists Fred Hersch and Ethan Iverson. Whiteside also tutored two American composers: Morton Gould and Vivian Fine. In the late 1950s, Rosoff set up the Abby Whiteside Foundation, dedicated to promote her ideas, train teachers and performers and organize recitals by pianists trained in Whiteside's methods.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 tributary to the Housatonic River in Western Connecticut. Course and watershed The Still River headwaters emanate from Farrington's Pond () at the New York border with Danbury, Connecticut. It meanders through Sanfords Pond () and Lake Kenosia () before entering a concrete aqueduct near downtown Danbury. It then turns north, becoming a more conventional river as it cuts through Brookfield and southern New Milford before joining with the Housatonic (). The river has a drainage area of 85 square miles, and a mean flow of 377 cubic feet per second.Hobbs, W. H. (1901). Character of the Drainage. In ‚ÄãStill Rivers of Western Connecticut (Vol. 13, pp. 17-26). Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. The Still River has a brief but impactful history that has influenced its condition today. The farming industry in Danbury led to extreme pollution in the river. Beginning around the 1860s, the river again experienced significant mercury pollution from the hatting industry that continued for several years. This pollution had both ecological and anthropogenic effects on the surrounding environment, eventually leading to a need for remediation and cleanup.  History  Even before the hatting industry began in the late 1700s, the Still River was known as a dead river. This was due to pollution from farms in the area surrounding Danbury, CT. Farmers used the river as a cite to get rid of waste and other toxic debris. Historical documents from Danbury and surrounding towns cited the river as a sewage dump around the 1880s, and the water was unusable for both agricultural and industrial use. It wasn't until a court case ruling in 1895, along with the Clean Water Act in 1972 that the city of Danbury was required to take responsibility for the sate of the riverhttps://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEEP/water/watershed_management/wm_plans/still/stillriverdanburywbppdf.pdf. In 1993, Danbury constructed a new sewage treatment plant to help improve water quality. In 2014, the Still River Partners was created with the hopes of rebuilding the watershed, and as of 2019, this group is still responsible for maintaining and improving the river. Pollution Mercury nitrate was discharged to the river by the hatting industry from circa 1860 through the first half of the 1900s. The hat factories used the chemical in the felt making process to remove animal fur from pelts. During this time, levels of mercury were found to be 5-10 ppm with extremes up to 100 ppm. These levels were about 500 times higher than background levels. Although the hatting industry was the main cause of mercury pollution, there were other industries that contributed as well. The P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company was a fur removal company sited on the Still River. During the peak of the hatting industry, mercury pollution transported via the river's current into the Housatonic River, and into the Long Island Sound. The mercury pollution was detrimental to the river's life and the surrounding ecosystems, and didn't start to fully rebound until the construction of the sewage treatment plant. Many species of fish can now be found, and kayak ramps have been installed downriver from Danbury. Cleanup and Remediation At least three organizations have an interest in preserving the Still River and its watershed. Spearheaded by Danbury's Health Department, the Still River Alliance was organized in 1995 as a consortium of three different groups. The Alliance developed a website (see external links below) which has not been updated for several years. Due to budget cuts, the driving force behind the Alliance, Jack Kozuchowski, retired and the Still River Alliance seems to have floundered since then. Mr. Kozuchowski is currently an environmental consultant. Coordinated by the Housatonic Valley Association and with funding from Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, key stakeholders and municipalities formed the Still River Partners group and launched an EPA approved watershed planning process to improve the water quality of the Still River which is still active today. Development and Conservation The Housatonic Valley Economic Development Partnership is striving to develop a River Trail on the Still and Housatonic rivers for canoeing and kayaking. They periodically organize river clean-ups, using paid contractors and volunteers, to clear debris from the river. They also lobby for kayak put-in/out ramps. The beginning of the trail is located behind the Marriott Courtyard hotel, just off of Route 84 (Exit 8) in Danbury. Rapids interrupt the river trail in Brookfield (no portage is available), and three dams across the Housatonic require portages along the way to Long Island Sound.The dams include the Shepaug Dam that impounds Lake Lillinonah, the Stevenson Dam Hydroelectric Plant that impounds Lake Zoar, and the Derby Dam between Derby and Shelton that impounds Lake Housatonic. The Still River Preserve in Brookfield covers about adjacent to the river. The preserve is owned by Weantinoge Heritage Land Trust of New Milford, Connecticut. The city of Danbury has a $4.85 million bonding package, approved in a February 2008 referendum, for use in building recreational projects on city-owned land. A list of potential projects was prepared. It includes completing the native plant hedgerow at Lake Kenosia (part of the Still River, west of the city) and doing a feasibility study to build a boardwalk and bird-watching site on about the city owns in Mill Plain Swamp (Lake Kenosia discharges into the swamp, which drains into the Still River). A separate $6.6 million bonding package, approved in the same referendum, could be used to purchase Sanford's Pond and building a trail through it.

Currently, the mall has a gross leasable area of ,International Council of Shopping Centers: Monmouth Mall , accessed September 21, 2006 making it the fourth largest shopping mall in New Jersey (tied with Willowbrook Mall), boasting over 150 shops. The mall is located near the Garden State Parkway at exit 105 and NJ 18 near the former location of the Eatontown Circle. Anchor stores at the mall are Boscov's, J. C. Penney, and Macy's. Lord & Taylor left the mall in 2019.  History  Entrance to the mall from Route 36 eastbound. Opened on March 1, 1960, as a , 14-building, 50-store open-air center, originally called \\"Monmouth Shopping Center\\", was built on what was then a farm owned by the Valentino Family of the nearby city of Long Branch, New Jersey. Original anchors of the mall consisted of Bamberger's (at that time a subsidiary of Macy's) and Montgomery Ward. After pulling out of New Jersey, Montgomery Ward became Alexander's in 1975. The mall was enclosed and expanded to its current size in 1975. The older section of the mall continued to be one level while the new expansion was two levels anchored by Abraham & Straus, Hahne's and JCPenney that appeared in this mall in 1976. In 1987, the mall was renovated. The renovation brought in new lighting, new flooring, and new glass and chrome handrails along the second level; took out the in-floor planters and replaced them with movable planters; closed off the mall entrance near the former arcade on the Wyckoff Road side of the old wing; and raised the lowered seating areas in front of the anchors. Ashley Tisdale was discovered at the mall in 1989 as a three-year-old. In 1994-1996, the mall was expanded to include an elevator and a food court (modeled after a Jersey Shore theme) including 1920s style beach photos wrapped around the columns in the older section of the mall, as well as Nobody Beats the Wiz, a new 15-screen Loews Theatres (now AMC) and Old Navy to replace the closed Caldor. The mall also saw minor cosmetic changes that consisted of replacing black with sky blue in the color schemes through painting and retiling, as well as new lighting along the pillars. Through the years, Monmouth Mall has seen many different anchors that have come and gone, however, J.C. Penney was built by themselves in 1976 and remains to this day. In 1987, the Bamberger's brand was eliminated and the store was renamed for its parent corporation, Macy's. Anchor changes consisted of Caldor replacing Alexander's in 1986, Macy's replacing the former store Bamberger's in 1987, Lord & Taylor replacing the former store Hahne's in 1990, Stern's replacing Abraham & Straus in 1995 and Boscov's replacing Stern's in 2001. In 2010, Planet Fitness opened at Monmouth Mall. Monmouth Mall went through a significant expansion in 2009. In mid-2010, cosmetic renovations started at the mall including new tile, paint, lighting, and a complete overhaul of the food court. The renovations lasted until summer 2011. In 2012, Vornado Realty Trust announced plans to sell its portfolio of enclosed shopping malls. In August 2015, Vornado's fifty percent stake and management in the Monmouth Mall was sold to co-owner Kushner Companies for $38 million. =Redevelopment= In February 2016, Monmouth Mall owner Kushner Companies announced conceptual plans to redevelop the mall into a pedestrian-friendly \\"live, work and play\\" development at a cost of around $500 million. The development, which would be renamed the \\"Monmouth Town Center\\" would include a revamped tenant mix, a hotel, a residential component, and an outdoor plaza, along with biker- and pedestrian-friendly greenspaces and streetscape. The residential component would be composed of one- and two-bedroom units to minimize impact on the local public school system and traffic. Kushner Companies then-CEO Jared Kushner noted the decline of traditional enclosed shopping malls in the 21st Century and consumer trends of the Millennial generation as catalysts behind the redevelopment. On April 27 of that year, a public meeting was held in a local middle school gymnasium where Eatontown's mayor Dennis Connelly and the Borough Council spoke out against a zoning change that would allow the expansion of the mall. Several borough residents also spoke out against the redevelopment, and Kushner announced the abandonment of the project at the same meeting. As part of a proposal issued in January 2018 named The Heights At Monmouth, announced back in 2017, the two-story wing covering that includes Boscov's would be demolished and additions totaling would bring the mall's total gross leasable area to . During this time, Kusner partnered with Rouse Properties (now Brookfield Properties) for the redevelopment. The redevelopment was approved on July 16, 2018. The new plans include opening up the two story mall corridor and also create new outdoor corridors. The anchor tenants (except Boscov's, which is owned by the mall owners and Lord & Taylor) will remain unaffected. On September 7, 2018, it was announced that Lord & Taylor would be closing as part of a plan to close 10 stores nationwide. The store closed in January 2019.

Roy of Heavy D & the Boyz) in 1990. The song was the lead single off their debut album, Mecca and the Soul Brother, released in 1992, and later became a staple of classic early 1990s hip hop. The song peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Overview Pete Rock in a 2007 interview with Village Voice: =Content= Over a saxophone and bass sample of Tom Scott's cover of \\"Today\\" by Jefferson Airplane, CL Smooth unravels fond memories of his own childhood, being the son of a young teenage mother, her father and four siblings, and the love he feels for other family members in working class Mount Vernon. The chorus's ad libs are provided by Pete Rock. The 12 second intro is sampled from the 1971 song \\"When She Made Me Promise\\" by The Beginning of the End.

Verse one discusses the hardships of growing up with a single mother. CL Smooth talks about how his father did not play a role in helping his mother raise him or his sister, and how his mother was forced to take on both roles in the household. He says that although his mother raised him right, he still needed a male figure in his life. He ultimately concludes the first verse saying that the lack of male leadership destines young men to repeat the cycle of not being involved in their own children‚Äôs lives. In the second verse CL Smooth talks about how his uncle played the crucial role of a male father figure in his life and helped him become a man and how more males need to make a positive impact on the community. Finally in the third verse CL Smooth speaks to his friend Troy. He thanks him for being one of the only people who believed in him and kept him on the right path. He then continues to update Troy on the well being of his family and saying that they reminisce about him. =References and cover versions= It has been lyrically referenced in songs including \\"My Advice 2 You\\" by Gang Starr off the Moment of Truth album, \\"Home of the Greats\\" by Black Milk, \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" by Kanye West, \\"Reminisce\\" by Mos Def, Bilal and Common, \\"Ego Trippin' (Part Two)\\" by De La Soul, \\"Memory Lane\\" by Nas, \\"Stay Around\\" by Talib Kweli, \\"It Is Me\\" by Method Man, \\"Nostalgia\\" by Chance the Rapper, \\"I Want You\\" by Common, \\"School of Hard Knocks\\" by Californian Rock/Rap group P.O.D., and \\"More\\" by Flying Lotus featuring Anderson .Paak.

US 66 covered a total of through Arizona. The highway ran from west to east, starting in Needles, California, through Kingman and Seligman to the New Mexico state line. Nationally, US 66 ran from Santa Monica, California, to Chicago, Illinois. In its height of popularity, US 66 was one of the most popular highways in the state of Arizona, sometimes carrying over one million cars a year. In the early years, US 66 had to compete with other major U.S. Highways for construction and improvement funding. The highway also played and important role during the Dust Bowl as a means for refugees (also known as \\"Okies\\") to escape the ruined farmlands of the Great Plains and migrate to California. Experiences of these refugees traveling through Arizona were largely detailed in John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath, and the 1940 movie adaption that followed. During the mid-20th century, the highway became a tourist destination, spawning the existence of several new motels, restaurants and other road-side businesses and attractions. With the introduction of Interstate 40 (I-40), US 66 began declining considerably, with some of the towns along the highway becoming ghost towns. Following the completion of I-40, US 66 was completely decommissioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) in 1984, then retired nationwide the following year. Significant portions of the old highway remain, such as State Route 66 (SR 66) between Kingman and the Yavapai‚ÄìCoconino county line east of Peach Springs. Since 1987, other sections have been designated as Historic Route 66, which is both an Arizona Historic Road and a National Scenic Byway.  Route description  US 66 was one of the main transcontinental highways in Arizona, serving as the main east‚Äìwest highway through the northern end of the state. Nationally, US 66 ran from Chicago, Illinois, to the Los Angeles, California, metropolitan area. The highway in Arizona was over in its earlier years, between California and New Mexico. The route originally went from Topock through Oatman to Kingman. Later, the route between Topock and Kingman was switched to an alignment going through Yucca. From Kingman, US 66 went northeast to Peach Springs before heading southeast to Seligman. Between Seligman and the New Mexico state line near Lupton, US 66 traveled the same basic route I-40 takes today, through Flagstaff, Winslow and Holbrook. Save for several city streets east of Flagstaff, most of US 66 has either been cut off, abandoned, destroyed or rebuilt into sections of I-40. Notable exceptions include the original route through Oatman, SR 66, multiple current and former I-40 Business Loops and Townsend‚ÄìWinona Road from US 89 to I-40 in Winona. Several sections of the highway no longer part of the Arizona State Highway System are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The following route description roughly follows the path US 66 would have traversed across Arizona in 1940. = California border to Kingman = Old US 66 over Sitgreaves Pass, east of Oatman US 66 entered Arizona from Needles, California, on the Old Trails Bridge across the Topock Gorge and Colorado River, within the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, arriving in Topock, Arizona. The route headed northeast, where it crossed the path of present-day I-40 and the BNSF Railway (formerly the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway). The highway then curved east for less than a mile, before curving directly north on Mohave County Route 10 (also known as Oatman Highway), past present-day Golden Shores through Bureau of Land Management-managed federal lands. About north of Golden Shores, US 66 arrived at the foothills of the Black Mountains, following the base of the those mountains for before entering them. Shortly afterward, the old highway arrived in the town of Oatman, passing through the center of the old mining town. North of Oatman, US 66 turned in a generally eastward direction winding its way up and through the Black Mountains over treacherous curves. US 66 passed through the small mining community of Goldroad and the adjacent mine, before continuing on its winding path up the mountainsides. Less than east of the Goldroad Mine, US 66 crossed over Sitgreaves Pass at an elevation of , making its slow winding descent towards the other side of the Black Mountains. The highway finally exited the mountains at Cold Springs Station, heading straight east before curving northeast again, away from the mountains. As it headed northeast, US 66 entered the town of McConnico, crossing the path of present-day I-40 again, before turning it turned north, and paralleled the Santa Fe Railway and curving through a small set of mountains. The highway and railroad then arrived in Kingman; US 66 followed Main Street (now Andy Devine Avenue). US 66 met US 93 and US 466 at a former highway junction, which is now the spot of Locomotive Park, the home of Santa Fe Railway No. 3759, a 3751 class 4-8-4 Northern steam locomotive. US 66 continued through town on Main Street, and curved northeast towards I-40 at the eastern end of Kingman. About northeast of Kingman, US 66 crossed under present-day I-40, and continued northeast through the present day Kingman metro area on what is now SR 66. = Kingman to Seligman = Old US 66 through downtown Oatman Between Kingman and Seligman, I-40's more southerly and more direct path diverges from former US 66 by approximately , putting considerable distance between former US 66 and the current Interstate. SR 66 and Crookton Road comprise the route of old US 66 between Kingman and Seligman. The state highway designation currently covers just of a section east of Kingman. As US 66 headed northeast from Kingman on SR 66 and paralleled the Santa Fe Railway, the highway made a gradual northeastern curve about from Kingman, and entered another mountain range, where it arrived at the town of Hackberry. From Hackberry, US 66 then curved northeast through the mountains, passing through the towns of Valentine and Crozier. Upon entering a small mountain valley, the highway passed through the town of Truxton before entering the mountains again at Peach Springs. Between Valentine and Peach Springs, SR 66 takes a later routing of US 66, which is straighter and has fewer curves. The older, less straight alignment, used through 1940, can be seen on either side of present-day SR 66. A natural feature and tourist attraction called the Grand Canyon Caverns, just east of Peach Springs, are among the largest dry caverns in the United States. US 66 (now SR 66) west of Seligman Upon leaving Peach Springs, US 66 curved southeast into the Hualapai Indian Reservation. Shortly afterwards, the highway left Mohave County and continued east into Coconino County. Shortly after entering Coconino County, US 66 entered Yavapai County. The route briefly entered Coconino County again for less than , before crossing into Yavapai County for a second time, where it remained for several miles. This final crossing of the Yavapai‚ÄìCoconino county line also serves as the present terminus of SR 66\\\\. From here on out, US 66 continued southeast as a county- maintained road (known as Crookton Road). This segment was previously the easternmost of SR 66, until ADOT retired this section and handed it over to Yavapai County in 1990 for maintenance. Old US 66 continued in a straight southeasterly direction for , then made a long curve south and east around a large volcanic bluff. After curving around the bluff, US 66 continued into Seligman, becoming Chino Street (today part of the Seligman I-40 Business Loop) into the center of town. Seligman is the birthplace of the first Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona, established by local barber Angel Delgadillo in 1987. The association obtained the first \\"Historic Route 66\\" designation, which the state initially placed on the segment of US 66 between Kingman and Seligman. East of Seligman, old US 66 diverged from the current business route. Where the business route turns south to return to I-40, US 66 headed southeast on Crookton Road. US 66 proceeded to follow Crookton Road through high desert towards Ash Fork. = Seligman to Williams = DeSoto's Beauty and Barber Shop on old US 66 in Ash Fork From Seligman, US 66 continued heading southeast for on Crookton Road. At I-40 exit 139, the highway briefly took on the route of the present-day Interstate, but curved southeast less than a mile later onto the south frontage road. The volcanic cinder asphalt road curved northeast from the Interstate and crossed over a small three-span concrete bridge, rejoining I-40 where the frontage road curves east. In the same spot as present day exit 144, US 66 curved northeast, taking Pine Avenue into downtown Ash Fork. US 66 continued straight onto 8th Street where Pine Avenue turned east, then made a right-hand curve onto Lewis Avenue. Today, Lewis Avenue is a one-way street, heading westbound only. Traffic heading east through Ash Fork must take Park Avenue, one block to the south. Both Lewis and Park make up a one-way pair carrying I-40 Business through town. Historic Route 66 through downtown Williams At the spot where the I-40 Business Loop turns south to become SR 89, there used to be an intersection where US 66 met at a junction with US 89\\\\. US 89 shared a wrong-way concurrency with US 66 between Ash Fork and Flagstaff. Both US 66 and northbound US 89 continued straight east from this intersection on to a highway alignment which no longer exists. The former highway straddled the north side of I-40, at times, often joining and leaving the present westbound lanes of the Interstate. East of Ash Fork, the route left the high desert terrain and entered a mountainous area, covered with Ponderosa pine forests. US 66/US 89 left I-40 around exit 149, heading northeast along an abandoned section of highway through the Monte Carlo truck stop. Approximately from the Interstate, the highway turned straight east for , then wound southeast for , crossing over the Interstate. The old highway made a broad curve less than southeast of I-40, then curved northeast, merging back into the route of I-40. Today, part of this section of former US 66/US 89 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as Abandoned Route 66, Ash Fork Hill. Both US 66 and US 89 split from I-40 again at Bill Williams Loop Road near McClelland Lake. The highway took the loop road for south of the Interstate before merging back into the route of I-40. At exit 161, US 66/US 89 curved northeast from I-40, then headed east on Historic Route 66 into downtown Williams. Parts of downtown Williams surrounding former US 66/US 89, including the roadway itself, are listed on the NRHP. The Williams Historic Business District and Urban Route 66, Williams, were added to the NRHP in 1984 and 1989, respectively. East of town, US 66/US 89 met the Santa Fe Railway at an underpass, then curved southeast onto an abandoned road, which tied into Mountain Man Trail in front of the Bearizona Wildlife Park. This was also the spot where US 66/US 89 intersected with the western terminus of SR 64, which headed north towards Valle and the Grand Canyon, while US 66 and US 89 continued east towards Flagstaff. = Williams to Flagstaff = The corner of Historic Route 66 and San Francisco Street in downtown Flagstaff US 66/US 89 continued east from the SR 64 junction outside Williams on Mountain Man Trail for , then crossed the present-day route of I-40 diagonally onto Deer Farm Road. Although the highway was paved in 1940, both Mountain Man Trail and Deer Farm Road have been downgraded to county maintained graded dirt roads. The highway skirted the northern shore of Davenport Lake, then crossed present-day I-40 to the south side frontage road, known as Mountain Ranch Resort Drive. US 66/US 89 crossed I-40 a second time at the spot of the current exit 171 onto a road called \\"Old Route 66\\". Unlike Mountain Man Trail and Deer Farm Road, Old Route 66 is still paved. The highway then headed east, gently winding through small pine forests, until US 66/US 89 reached the town of Parks. Small sections of Old Route 66 to the west and east of Parks are listed on the NRHP under the name Abandoned Route 66, Parks (1921). Just southeast of Parks, where Old Route 66 dead ends, US 66/US 89 crossed present-day I-40 diagonally to briefly parallel the Santa Fe Railway, before being subsumed into the route of I-40 once again. The old highway left I-40 again briefly along an abandoned graded curve on the south side of the Interstate just west of the Parks Rest Area. East of the rest area, US 66/US 89 split off a third time onto Bellemont Camp Road. The highway continued diagonally southeast through Bellemont, then merged back into I-40. The eastern end of Bellemont Camp Road (which can not be used as a through route by travelers today) is still paved in original concrete. Heading southeast out of Bellemont, US 66/US 89 used the route of I-40 until reaching present-day exit 191\\\\. Here, the highway angled southeasterly on I-40 Business into Flagstaff. The Santa Fe Railway Depot in Flagstaff The former route through Flagstaff is officially named \\"Historic Route 66\\". At Milton Road, US 66/US 89 intersected with SR 79 at its northern terminus. By 1941, SR 79 had been redesignated as US 89 Alternate (US 89A). US 89A, as its designation suggests, was an alternative, more direct route for US 89 traffic. US 89A provided a shorter travel distance between Flagstaff and Prescott, via Sedona and the mining town of Jerome. Today, US 89A is known as SR 89A. US 66/US 89 continued north on I-40 Business from the junction with US 89A to underpass with the Santa Fe Railway. On the other side of the underpass, the highway curved right onto Santa Fe Avenue and passed through downtown Flagstaff, including the Santa Fe Railway Depot. Just west of the depot is where current US 180 joins I-40 Business, former US 66 and former US 89. Heading southeast of downtown, paralleling the Santa Fe Railway, US 66/US 89 made two northeasterly curves along with the railroad. At the intersection with Country Club Drive north of I-40 exit 201, current US 180 and I-40 Business split off, heading south to join I-40. This intersection also serves as the current southern terminus of US 89. Just west of this intersection, a later routing of US 66 split off and paralleled the railroad towards Walnut Canyon National Monument and I-40 exit 204 (where the later routing joined the Interstate). The earlier route of former US 66 (used through 1940), and current route of US 89, continue northeast from this intersection towards the Flagstaff suburb of Townsend. = Flagstaff to Winslow = Postcard of the Winona Trading post on old US 66 On the outskirts of the Flagstaff metropolitan area in Townsend, US 66 split from US 89. US 89 heads north towards the Glen Canyon Dam and Page, while old US 66 took an abandoned gradual curve to the east onto Townsend‚ÄìWinona Road. The highway proceeded to wind through small pine forest wilderness, passing several small communities along the way, heading first east, then southeast near Sunset Crater and several other extinct volcanic cinder cones of the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Shortly before reaching the current route of I-40 east of Flagstaff, US 66 passed through a small unincorporated community called Winona, made famous in the song \\"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\\". In Winona, US 66 crossed an abandoned steel bridge. Today, the modern road uses a concrete bridge built right next to the older structure. US 66 proceeded to cross over the Santa Fe Railway on an overpass heading out of Winona. Where Townsend‚ÄìWinona Road continues south to end at I-40 exit 211, US 66 continued east along the southern side of the railroad on Coconino County Route 394\\\\. Approximately southeast of exit 211, the county route dead-ends at the westbound lanes of I-40. US 66 continued on an abandoned highway grade southeast of this point (some of which has been overlaid by I-40), then zig-zagged northward, crossing a concrete bridge over a small gulch. North of the gulch, US 66 turned southeast, passing north of the abandoned Twin Arrows travel center. The old highway continued on an abandoned roadway and part of the south frontage road, before gradually being subsumed into the route of present-day I-40. This is also the area where US 66 left the pine forest area which started near Ash Fork and re-entered high desert terrain. Canyon Diablo Bridge carrying US 66 across cross Canyon Diablo near Two Guns Near Exit 225, US 66 diverted from I-40 southeast on Buffalo Range Road. Around southeast of the Interstate, US 66 curved east on an abandoned highway grade to rejoin the route of I-40, where Buffalo Range Road turns sharply to the southwest. US 66 proceeded to follow I-40 east for , then split off again to head straight southeast, followed by a sharp curve to the north to cross the Canyon Diablo Bridge over Canyon Diablo into Two Guns. Two Guns, now abandoned, was a popular Old West-themed tourist attraction during the height of popularity of US 66\\\\. The most popular attraction at Two Guns was the Apache Death Cave, the site where several Apache individuals were murdered by a group of Navajo individuals. Leaving Two Guns, US 66 made a broad curve to the southeast across present-day I-40 exit 230, heading away from the Interstate on an abandoned roadbed. About southeast of exit 230, and after passing the access road heading south to Meteor Crater, US 66 curved northeast to cross I-40, then made a gradual curve to the southeast. Shortly afterward, US 66 crossed I-40 a second time, where the westbound Meteor Crater Rest Area sits today. Immediately after crossing I-40, US 66 curved northeast to cross over I-40 a third time along with the Santa Fe Railway, then made a sharp turn to the east, followed by a gradual curve to the southeast. At I-40 exit 239, US 66 took the abandoned roadbed back to I-40 and followed the route of the present-day Interstate. About southeast of exit 239, US 66 left I-40 again onto an abandoned roadbed between the current Interstate and the Santa Fe Railway heading southeast, eventually crossing into Navajo County. Where the I-40 Industrial Spur crosses the railroad, the abandoned roadbed, which carried US 66, tied into \\"Old West Highway 66\\", where the highway entered Winslow. At the intersection with current SR 99 (former I-40 Business), US 66 headed southeast into downtown Winslow onto Second Street. Through downtown, US 66 passed the Winslow Visitor Center and Standin' on the Corner Park. At the intersection with Williamson Avenue, where SR 99 turns south with southbound SR 87, US 66 met SR 65 at its northern terminus. From here, SR 65 headed south to its other terminus at the Coconino National Forest boundary, while US 66 continued southeast on present-day northbound SR 87 out of town. = Winslow to Holbrook = Street view of US 66 through downtown Winslow, c. 1955 Heading east out of Winslow, US 66 split from SR 87 onto an old roadbed, and crossed the Little Colorado River over a bridge that no longer exists. US 66 rejoined SR 87 shortly before the current highway turns north towards I-40 exit 257 and Homolovi State Park. Just north of Winslow, Homolovi State Park preserves over 300 Ancestral Puebloan archaeological sites. Where SR 87 turns north, US 66 continued northeast, merging into I-40. Where I-40 curves southeast, US 66 continued northeast onto Hibbard Road, then made a sharp turn east onto an old roadbed from the Interstate. US 66 proceeded to make a gradual S-curve to the southeast and cross a tributary of the Little Colorado River on another no longer extant bridge. The highway continued straight southeast from the bridge crossing for , then made a sweeping curve south by southeast and crossed I-40. On the south side of I-40, US 66 made another gradual curve back to the southeast, then a second curve to the east, and merged back into Hibbard Road. Where Hibbard Road ends, US 66 continued diagonally across I-40, then turned immediately south again, crossing I-40 a second time onto the south frontage road. Here, US 66 arrived at the Jack Rabbit Trading Post. The trading post once posted signs up and down the highway for hundreds of miles between Arizona and Missouri. Today, one of the iconic billboards still stands next to the trading post. It is a wooden sign displaying a black jackrabbit on a yellow background with the phrase \\"Here It Is\\" spelled in large capitalized red letters on the left side of the jackrabbit. US 66 continued southeast from the trading post along the south frontage road, paralleling the Santa Fe Railway and Little Colorado River. Main office of the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook at night At the point where the south frontage road curves northeast to straddle the south side of I-40, US 66 crossed the Interstate becoming Main Street into Joseph City. US 66 through Joseph City is designated today as I-40 Business. East of town, US 66 curved southeast across I-40 onto the south frontage road close to the town post office. Where the frontage road makes a quick U-shape near exit 247, US 66 continued straight. In front of the Cholla Power Plant, US 66 curved to rejoin I-40. US 66 followed I-40 southeast past a reservoir and earthen dam. Where I-40 curves to the east, US 66 split off to the north side of I-40, becoming the north side frontage road. US 66 followed the north frontage road for a short distance, then rejoined I-40 momentarily at exit 283\\\\. Immediately after rejoining the Interstate, US 66 diverged, turning to the northeast, and rejoined the north frontage road. Where the frontage road makes a sharp curve to the north, US 66 continued straight east on an abandoned roadbed to I-40 exit 285. At exit 285, US 66 crossed present-day I-40 into Holbrook becoming Hopi Drive (today signed as US 180 and I-40 Business). Along the western section of old US 66 in Holbrook is the Wigwam Village Motel, a motor court built to resemble a group of tipis. At the intersection of Hopi Drive and Navajo Boulevard, US 180 heads southeast towards Springerville and Silver City, New Mexico, concurrent for a short distance with southbound SR 77. In 1940, this intersection was the western terminus of US 260\\\\. US 260 followed the general path of present-day US 180 into New Mexico, where it ended in Deming. US 66 on the other hand, followed northbound SR 77 and I-40 Business on Navajo Boulevard. = Holbrook to the New Mexico border = Where SR 77 joins I-40 at exit 286, US 66 continued following I-40 Business and Navajo Boulevard north, then northeast, passing through the northeastern edge of Holbrook. At exit 289, US 66 took on the route of I-40, and split off again where exit 292 is today. US 66 followed an old roadbed on the north side of I-40 around the community of Sun Valley, then rejoined the Interstate at the edge of the Painted Desert. US 66 utilized a section of abandoned roadbed east of West Twin Wash, then crossed to a short section of roadbed and bridge on the south side of the Interstate at exit 300\\\\. US 66 rejoined I-40 and followed the eastbound lanes to the Painted Desert Indian Center, where the highway briefly split off onto the south frontage road. East of exit 303, US 66 rejoined I-40, where the frontage road curves to run parallel with the Interstate. US 66 diverged from I-40 where the south frontage road curves northeast and heads away from the Interstate. The Painted Desert as seen from former US 66 US 66 followed the south frontage road for , then diagonally crossed I-40 onto a now-abandoned roadway through the Painted Desert, entering Apache County. Within Petrified Forest National Park, US 66 met at a junction with SR 63, which acted as the main route through the southern end of the park. Today, SR 63 is no longer a state highway and is known as Petrified Forest Road. US 66 continued northeast on the abandoned highway, which was located several miles north of I-40, through the heart of the Painted Desert. after the intersection with SR 63, US 66 arrived at the now-abandoned Painted Desert Trading Post. About northeast of the trading post, US 66 crossed over to the south side of I-40 onto County Route 7385\\\\. US 66 followed County Route 7385 around the Navajo Trading Post and McCarrell Memorial Cemetery to exit 330. At exit 330, US 66 diagonally crossed I-40 onto an abandoned road heading northeast into Chambers and crossed present-day US 191\\\\. US 66 proceeded east on the frontage road from the intersection with US 191, then rejoined I-40. Exit 339 in Sanders used to be an at-grade intersection where US 66 met its child route, US 666\\\\. From the intersection, US 666 southbound followed present-day US 191 to Springerville, Safford, Willcox and Douglas, while US 66 and northbound US 666 ran concurrently northeast along present-day I-40. Northeast of exit 341, US 66/US 666 followed Querino Dirt Road and crossed over Querino Canyon on the Querino Canyon Bridge. At exit 346, US 66/US 666 rejoined I-40, and followed the Interstate through Houck and Allentown. Immediately northeast of exit 354, US 66/US 666 followed the south frontage road alongside I-40 into the small hamlet of Lupton. East of Lupton, US 66/US 666 merged back into I-40 and crossed into New Mexico, then continued east towards Gallup.  History  US 66 is one of the most popular highways in the history of the state of Arizona. It was also once one of the heaviest traveled highways in the state. Often called the \\"Main Street of America\\", US 66 has been the subject of a popular song (\\"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\\") and television show as well as several movies, including the 1940 movie The Grapes of Wrath and the 2006 children's movie Cars. The history of the highway dates back to United States Army expeditions during the mid-19th century and an ancestral highway known as the National Old Trails Road, one of the original transcontinental highways in North America. US 66 itself existed between 1926 and 1985. It was one of the original U.S. Highways in Arizona and, until the arrival of US 60 in 1931, US 66 was one of only two primary transcontinental highways in the entire state (the other was its southern counterpart, US 80). US 66 was used as a means of escape by refugees from the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression, and became an extremely popular tourist highway during the 1950s. The highway was largely bypassed and replaced in the latter half of the 20th century by I-40, which lead to the eventual decommissioning of US 66 as an active U.S. Highway. However, thanks to a preservation effort, largely kicked off by Seligman-based barber Angel Delgadillo, US 66 has made a comeback and is once again a popular tourist destination for travelers from around the world. =Background= In 1853, United States Army Lieutenant A. W. Whipple traversed the northern end of New Mexico Territory to survey a route for a proposed transcontinental railroad. Lieutenant Whipple was followed by Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale in the winter of 1858 and 1859. Beale created a second survey of the northern territory along the 35th Parallel, this time for a proposed wagon road. The wagon road was to start in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and travel to the Colorado River on the California border. Beale returned later in 1859 with a group of men to construct the road. The outfit was complemented with 22 camels as well as tools and supplies needed to build the wagon road. Beale's men constructed a path wide by removing rocks and vegetation in the way. The new road became known as Beale's Wagon Road, becoming a major artery for westward expansion and immigration. The road remained a popular means of travel until 1883, when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was completed through northern Arizona. An early automobile driving on the National Old Trails Road near Holbrook, c. 1915 In 1914, the state of Arizona had finished reorganizing an earlier system of territorial roads into a new state highway system, managed by the Office of the State Engineer. Besides converting the two existing territorial maintained roads into new state highways, the Office of the State Engineer also acquired several roads not previously maintained by the state. One of the new acquisitions was Beale's Wagon Road. Now a state highway, Beale's Wagon Road was designated the Santa Fe Highway by the state. Santa Fe Highway started at the Colorado River in Topock, extending north through Kingman, then east through Flagstaff to Holbrook, where it headed southeast through Springerville into New Mexico. Also in 1914, the National Old Trails Road, an early transcontinental auto trail, was designated over the Santa Fe Highway. Outside Arizona, the National Old Trails Road ran from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles, California. The National Old Trails Highway Association also had plans to construct a new road through Lupton for a shorter more direct route to New Mexico. For a short time, the National Old Trails Road was partnered with a local auto trail known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, which acted as an alternate route going from the National Old Trails Road to Phoenix and Yuma. Disagreements soon arose between the managers of both highways. The National Old Trails Highway Association preferred the main route be the highway to Topock, while the Ocean-to-Ocean Transcontinental Highway Association preferred the route to Yuma. Both organizations eventually ended their partnership and went in opposite directions. In the early days, National Old Trails Road traffic crossing the river utilized a ferry crossing between Topock and Needles on the California side of the river. The ferry, established in 1890, was used until 1914, when a river flood destroyed it. In response, the upstream Red Rock Bridge, owned by the Santa Fe Railway, became the new river crossing for National Old Trails Road motorists. The railroad had allowed cars to use the bridge so long as the drivers were willing to pay a toll. Construction started on the Old Trails Bridge, a dedicated automobile bridge, on June 30, 1915, and was completed several months later on February 20, 1916. The bridge was paid for by the states of California and Arizona as well as the Bureau of Indian Affairs at a cost of $75,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The bridge itself was a steel arch structure designed by San Bernardino County surveyor S. A. Sourwine. Once construction on the Old Trails Bridge had been completed, National Old Trails Road traffic was moved onto the new bridge and the Red Rock Bridge became train only once again. From 1916 to 1928, the Old Trails Bridge held the record of being the longest three-hinged arch bridge in the United States. Between 1915 and 1922, the National Old Trails Highway was surfaced with gravel between Topock and Oatman as well as between Seligman and Holbrook. A small section just outside Ash Fork was also reconstructed and realigned at this time, becoming the first road to ever be paved using volcanic cinders. The highway was also paved through Flagstaff in 1921 using concrete. In 1921, the Arizona state highway system was reorganized again following the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. The state no longer referred to the National Old Trails Road as the Santa Fe Highway, and instead re-designated Topock‚ÄìKingman‚ÄìAsh Fork Highway and the Ash Fork‚ÄìFlagstaff‚ÄìWinslow‚ÄìHolbrook Highway west of Holbrook. East of Holbrook, the original route through Springerville became the Holbrook‚ÄìSpringerville‚ÄìNew Mexico State Line Highway, while the recently constructed new route through Lupton became the Holbrook‚ÄìLupton Highway. =U.S. Highway designation= Across the country, the numerous named auto trails began creating problems for motorists. Many auto trails had confusing alternate routes and were not always the most direct routes; also, multiple different auto trails often overlapped on the same roadway. During the annual meeting of the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in San Francisco, California, in 1924, Minnesota state maintenance engineer A.H. Hinkle lobbied the organization to reorganize the nation's transcontinental highway system, suggesting a nationwide numbering system of well-located and direct interstate highways be implemented. AASHO agreed to Hinkle's ideas, passing a resolution on November 20, 1924, to develop a better organized interstate highway system. AASHO then sent a recommendation to the Secretary of Agriculture Howard M. Gore to create a joint board between the Bureau of Public Roads and state highway officials from across the nation to develop a new organized system of numbered interstate highways. Gore acted on the recommendation in 1925, establishing the Joint Board on Interstate Highways. After intensive discussion, debating, and planning, the Joint Board submitted a mostly finalized proposal to the new Secretary of Agriculture, William M. Jardine, on October 26, 1925. The new system would use signs in the form of a white shield with black outlines, displaying the name of the state in which the highway was traveling through, the letters \\"U.S.\\" to symbolize the highway system being an interstate numbering system rather than a regional state system, and the number of the route below the letters \\"U.S.\\" on the shield. The highways would also be numbered in an organized fashion with the highest numbers being in the northeastern United States and lowest being in the southwest. Even-numbered routes would travel east to west while odd-numbered routes would travel north to south. The major north‚Äìsouth routes would end with the number \\"1\\" as the last digit, while major transcontinental east‚Äìwest routes would utilize the number \\"0\\" as the last digit. This proposed system would come to be known as the United States Numbered Highway System. Among the new proposed highways was a roughly crescent-shaped route named U.S. Route 60 (US 60). US 60 would run from Los Angeles, California, to Chicago, Illinois. However, after a major disagreement and argument between proponents of the Chicago-to‚ÄìLos Angeles route and dignitaries from the state of Kentucky, AASHO moved the proposed US 60 designation was moved onto a different highway between Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Springfield, Missouri. This was done to give the Kentucky proponents the benefit of having a route ending in \\"0\\" passing through their state. The future Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles route was first intended to be re- designated US 62, but was instead re-designated US 66 at the request of the Chicago‚ÄìLos Angeles route proponents. After some other alterations were made to the newly proposed U.S. Highway System, the system was ratified and approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926, making all the newly proposed routes official. With this, a large portion of the National Old Trails Road through the southwestern United States, including Arizona, was designated as a section of US 66\\\\. The original route of the National Old Trails Road southeast of Holbrook through Springerville became the westernmost section of US 70 (now US 180), making the junction of the old and new National Old Trails alignments the national western terminus of the new US 70. The US 66 designation was recognized by the newly formed Arizona State Highway Department (sometimes abbreviated as ASHD) after the state highway system was reorganized on September 9, 1927. The reorganization entailed a transition from state-named highways to state- and U.S.-numbered highways. Arizona now had two principal cross-country U.S. Highways across the entire state: US 66 served the northern part of the state, while the southern half of Arizona heavily promoted and focused on US 80. Proponents of US 80 in Arizona had given their highway the nickname \\"The Main Street Through Arizona\\". At the same time, the newly formed U.S. Highway 66 Association dubbed US 66 the \\"Main Street of America\\", which may have been in response to the US 80 nickname. From 1927 onward, a friendly in-state competition existed between proponents of US 66 and US 80 within Arizona. =The early years= US 66 through Sitgreaves Pass near Oatman in the early 1930s The name \\"National Old Trails Road\\" was officially dropped from US 66 in Arizona by December 1927. Immediately, the counties US 66 traveled through in northern Arizona began campaigning for the highway to be fully paved. In the middle of 1928, numerous bond issues passed by cities, states and the federal government were allocated to help begin paving work on US 66 across the nation, including a large portion of the route within Arizona. The total sum of the multiple bond issues was $41 million (equivalent to $ in ). To further supplement the cost of paving US 66, $150,000 was (equivalent to $ in ) raised by the U.S. Highway 66 Association on June 7, 1928. Extensive preparation work in the form of multiple aerial surveys and a detailed study regarding finances and local construction logistics was also undertaken to aid in paving through Arizona. In 1928, almost none of US 66 was paved in Arizona, save for a stretch of highway between Flagstaff and Winona. This section had been paved back in 1921 with concrete mixed with locally sourced volcanic cinder. The highway was given a non-paved secondary surfacing (another term for gravel surfacing) between the Colorado River and east of Peach Springs. A section of US 66 from Crookton through Ash Fork to Williams was also paved in secondary surfacing. This section was approximately long. Secondary surfacing was also extant on a section of highway running from Bellemont to Flagstaff, as well as a section between Meteor Mountain (just east of Canyon Diablo) and Holbrook. The remainder of US 66 was graded, but had no improved surfacing of any kind. The official 1929 Highway Department map depicted surfacing and road conditions along US 66 as being mostly unchanged since the previous year, although newspapers reported otherwise. By December 1929, reconstruction was underway between Holbrook and New Mexico on completely rebuilding and realigning the highway. Similar work was being undertaken between Holbrook and Winslow, including the construction of two new bridges. Paving work began between Flagstaff and Winslow as well as between Topock and Kingman. On December 29, 1929, the state highway commission reported $508,594.94 (equivalent to $ in ) had been allocated in state funds that year to rebuild US 66, with $305,982.79 (equivalent to $ in ) of said funds being spent to improve over of the highway by years end. Much of this work included grading and draining work, paving work, gravel surfacing and bridge construction. By 1930, noticeable changes were made to the highway. The route between Oatman and a point west of Peach Springs had reverted to an unimproved dirt road. However, the route was given a gravel surface between Williams and Flagstaff. Between Topock and Oatman, the highway was fully paved, as was the section between Meteor Mountain and Winslow. The highway had also been realigned and straightened between Seligman and Crookton. By 1931, all of US 66 between Flagstaff and Winslow was paved. Gravel surfacing was administered to US 66 from the New Mexico state line to an area southwest of Lupton. By 1932, US 66 had been paved between Crookton and Ash Fork. road surfacing also existed on the section of highway improved the year earlier, heading southwest from New Mexico through Lupton. Construction work was underway on US 66 between Seligman and Crookton, as was the highway between Oatman and Kingman. Despite the amount of work completed, a delegation of citizens representing towns along US 66 traveled to Phoenix on May 8, 1932, demanding the State Highway Commission to block funding for improvements to US 80 in favor of further improvements to US 66\\\\. Ultimately, the commission passed off the demands of the delegation and did not divert attention away from improving US 80. On June 5, 1933, Arizona Governor Benjamin Baker Moeur sent letters to state highway commissioners asking for selective amounts of state funding to be diverted from US 66, US 89 and US 260 instead be allocated to the construction of US 60 near Globe. Moeur further specified he wanted enough funding be left over for the other highways so as not to halt construction and maintenance operations. The request was met with controversy and protest, much of which came from the U.S. Highway 66 Association. On June 18, 1933, the association sent a train of 200 delegates from towns along US 66 and US 89 to attend a highway hearing the next day and hold active demonstrations against Moeur's requested budget change. The demonstrations included worded banners displaying support for the three affected U.S. Highways, marching and the demonstrators singing a song called \\"Sixty-Six the Main Street of Arizona\\" by a citizen from Holbrook. One of the demonstration and delegation leaders explained to a reporter for the Arizona Republic newspaper, \\"We feel that Highway 66, Highway 89 and Highway 260 have not gotten a 'square deal' from the highway commission in the past five years... We are here to make a gentlemanly appeal to the highway commission to do the right thing by the northern part of the state.\\" The delegation included people from Kingman, Seligman, Ash Fork, Williams, Flagstaff and Holbrook as well as US 89 and US 260 supporters from Concho, Adamana, St. Johns and Prescott. Despite the demonstrations and strong opposition raised by the US 66 delegation, the highway commission ultimately decided in favor of Moeur's request on June 20. Approximately $145,000 (equivalent to $ in ) from the 1933 to 1934 budget was transferred from projects along US 66 to the construction of US 60. US 66 near Valentine in the late 1930s By 1934, despite budget cuts to US 66, the construction work between Seligman and Crookton had extended to the previously paved section of US 66 northwest of Crookton. Construction work was also underway on US 66 between Ash Fork and Williams, part of the route from Williams to Flagstaff and the unpaved section of highway between Kingman and Peach Springs through Hackberry. Most of the highway between Holbrook and Lupton through Sanders and Navajo was also undergoing construction. road surfacing work was complete on US 66 between Williams and Bellemont, on a small section going through Peach Springs, between Oatman and Kingman and a small piece heading a few miles northeast of Holbrook. At this point, most of US 66 through Arizona was paved or undergoing resurfacing. The first known use of natural landscaping by the Arizona State Highway Department was performed along US 66 the same year. By 1935, almost all of US 66 between Topock and Peach Springs had been paved. road surfacing had also been completed on all of US 66 between Crookton and New Mexico. The last unpaved sections of US 66 remaining were a section of heading west from Crookton through Cedar Grove and a section heading northeast out of Valentine. Although these two sections were not yet paved, they were surfaced with rock or gravel, meaning all of US 66 at least had improved surfacing. Passage of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 by the United States federal government gave the Arizona State Highway Department the necessary provisions and funding to replace an at-grade railroad crossing in Winslow with an underpass in 1936. The entirety of US 66 in Arizona was paved by 1938. This made US 66 one of the first highways in Arizona to be completely paved. However, the title of first fully paved U.S. Highway in Arizona was taken three years earlier by the second incarnation of US 70, which entered Arizona from California through Ehrenberg and exited near Duncan into New Mexico. Albeit the paving work had been completed long before the Ehrenberg‚ÄìDuncan route had been designated as part of US 70. On January 24, 1938, the entirety of US 66 between Los Angeles and Chicago was designated as the Will Rogers Memorial Highway by the U.S. Highway 66 Association. US 66 also played a large role during the Dust Bowl era of the Great Depression. Refugees seeking a better life from drought and impoverished areas of the Great Plains states, often referred to as \\"Okies\\" (which started an insulting term used by long time California residents), extensively used US 66 as a means of escaping the heavily affected areas, looking for a better life in California. Western Arizona in particular provided a great obstacle for refugees traveling down US 66 to California: they would often have trouble crossing the Black Mountains on US 66 over Sitgreaves Pass. Many of their trucks would end up wrecked at the bottom of the mountain slopes next to the highway due to failed axle bearings. Refugee drivers were among the earliest US 66 travelers to hire locals to drive their often overloaded vehicles over the pass for them. The grades on this US 66 would sometimes pose a large enough challenge to these vehicles that driving the trucks in reverse over the pass was often necessary. After reaching the other side of the pass, the refugees would coast their vehicles down the other side to save gas. If the refugees needed gas, a man named Ed Edgerton ran a gas station complex known as \\"Ed's Camp\\" at the top of the pass. Most of the time, Edgerton was willing to barter with the refugees if they had little or no money. Sometimes, the refugees would trade or pawn valuable possessions to Edgerton for gas. Other times, Edgerton would have them work jobs at his station to earn their gas. Upon reaching the other side, the refugees would often establish camps along the Colorado River near Topock and Needles on the California side before continuing their journey. The rest of the route through Arizona was also difficult for refugees, due to the extremes of the desert heat during summertime. Famed author John Steinbeck would later go on to describe some of these experiences in his novel, The Grapes of Wrath. Part of the novel detailed the experiences of the Joad family, a fictional refugee family from Oklahoma taking US 66 through Arizona to California. In 1940, the novel was adapted by 20th Century Fox into a movie starring actor Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. Several scenes in the movie were filmed along US 66 in Arizona, including scenes where the family crossed the Arizona‚ÄìNew Mexico state line near Lupton and the Old Trails Bridge over the Colorado River in Topock. =The golden age= During the first three years of American involvement in World War II, civilian travel on US 66 declined greatly. In 1941, 17,600 cars a month were traveling westbound on the highway between New Mexico and California. By 1942, the number had decreased to 13,680 cars a month, then dropped to 7,040 cars a month by May 1943. This was largely because gasoline available to civilians was heavily rationed for the war effort and harder to come by. However, military traffic heavily used the highway during this time as several military installations were located near US 66. One such installation was the Navajo Army Depot in Bellemont. The military often transported troops, weapons and supplies. Despite the decline in civilian travel, people leaving the east coast to find wartime work in California often took US 66. At the end of the war, many of the people who had gone to California for work returned home to the east coast on US 66\\\\. The eastward migration caused US 66 traffic to increase from record low numbers to the highest volume of traffic the highway had seen up to that point. By October 1945, 700‚Äì800 cars a day were traveling down US 66 in Arizona and some cars had as many as 17 people inside them. At night, there were up to 137 cars parked on the side of the road, so the occupants could sleep during the night. Drivers often traveled down the highway at dangerous speeds or drove for long periods, becoming fatigued. This, in tandem with increasing traffic, caused the number of fatal car accidents to rise exponentially. Between January and October 1945, 198 people were killed in car accidents on US 66\\\\. As a result, the Arizona Highway Patrol had to greatly increase the number of patrolmen on US 66 to crack down on reckless driving. Shot of the Red Rock Bridge from a postcard, carrying US 66 across the Colorado River In 1945, the Santa Fe Railway constructed a new rail bridge over the Colorado River in Needles and Topock, upstream from the Old Trails and Red Rock Bridges. At the same time, California and Arizona had been looking to replace the Old Trails Bridge, as the structure had become insufficiently narrow and too weak for post-war truck and car traffic. Highway engineers determined the retired Red Rock Bridge could serve as a more than adequate replacement. The Red Rock Bridge had previously been rebuilt and reinforced twice during the early 20th century to handle heavier and faster train traffic. The railroad had planned on tearing down the Red Rock Bridge, but instead donated the structure to the states of California and Arizona along with of right of way on either side of the bridge. This was done partially due to the cost of converting the bridge into a highway crossing being less expensive than demolishing the veteran structure. Both states began surveying and planning to rebuild the Red Rock Bridge into a new Colorado River crossing for US 66\\\\. Once planning had been completed, the state governments of California and Arizona agreed to split the cost of conversion. The tracks were removed from the bridge and a concrete roadway put in its place. On May 21, 1947, the Red Rock Bridge was reopened to automobile traffic for the first time in 31 years, this time as a dedicated highway crossing. US 66 was immediately re-routed off the Old Trails Bridge onto the Red Rock Bridge. The Old Trails Bridge was originally to be demolished but was instead purchased by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and now carries part of a natural gas pipeline between California and Texas. An abandoned US 66 steel truss bridge on the old Winona route In 1946, the Arizona State Highway Department began planning a major improvement along US 66 between Flagstaff and Winslow. The plan was to construct a new highway between Flagstaff and Winona to shorten the travel time and the overall distance between Winslow and Flagstaff. The project was estimated to cost around $1,300,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Originally meant to be a single contract construction project, the bypass was later divided into two separate contracts. Bidding for both construction projects were opened on January 9 the same year with a scheduled completion date of September 30, 1947. The Fisher Construction Company and Tanner Construction Company were both awarded the contracts, with Fisher to construct the first east of Flagstaff and the remaining to be constructed by Tanner. By May 10, 1946, 30 percent of the section being constructed by Fisher was completed. By September 1946, both Tanner and Fisher had made substantial progress on their respective sections, with all excavation on the Tanner section completed, with preliminary paving work beginning. Both sections, however, were disconnected by the Santa Fe Railway which cut the new highway in half. At the time, planning for a railroad overpass was being undertaken by the State Highway Department. The H.L. Royden Company was awarded the contract for constructing the overpass. The new highway was opened to traffic in October 1947 and US 66 was re-routed onto it, bypassing the hamlet of Townsend between Flagstaff and Winona. The overall cost of the project ended up being $1,433,400 (equivalent to $ in ). Although the route between Townsend and Winona was removed from the state highway system, the section from Flagstaff to Townsend remained part of US 89, which shared a wrong-way concurrency with US 66 from Townsend to Ash Fork. Following the re-routing, the concurrency was shortened to an intersection between the old and new route in eastern Flagstaff. In 1950, the State Highway Department began planning construction of a new alignment of US 66 through Yucca. Construction was planned to start near Topock and head northeast through Yucca to connect with the existing highway near Kingman. At the time, the section between Topock and Kingman still followed the steep and winding path through Oatman into the Black Mountains and through Sitgreaves Pass. This section was built across this rough terrain instead of following the more level route to the east adopted by the railroad because the road followed the National Old Trails highway which was for gold mining in Oatman and Goldroad (now a ghost town). It was fraught with hairpin turns and was the steepest along the entire route, so much so that some early travelers, too frightened at the prospect of driving such a potentially dangerous road, hired locals to navigate the winding grade. By September 1950, the Oatman bypass was given priority on the state highway construction agenda, as US 66 was crucial to military defense traffic. The State Highway Department contracted the Phoenix- Tempe Stone Company to construct the first of the new route on September 15, 1950, at a cost of $262,152 (equivalent to $ in ). By early 1951, the bypass was under construction. Phoenix-Tempe was awarded a second contract on February 1, 1951, to build an overpass over the Santa Fe Railway in Yucca along with the approach roads to the overpass. In April 1951, a contract to construct of the new bypass was given to the W.J. Henson company for $234,872 (equivalent to $ in ). The Highway Department created another contract job in October 1951 to pave and construct a further of the bypass route, in hopes of speeding up the project. The Phoenix-Tempe company was again awarded the contract. Despite the highway's priority and rushed construction, the Yucca Overpass was delayed for several months due to a shortage of available steel. The steel was finally delivered to begin the overpass construction on January 25, 1951. Construction of the bypass continued through late 1951 to the middle of 1952. By August 1952, construction on the bypass was winding down. By this point, had been completed with the final under construction. The bypass was completed and opened to traffic on September 17, 1952. The overall construction of the bypass from 1950 to 1952 was done at record speed at the time, being the fastest major highway construction project within the state's history. US 66 was rerouted onto the new bypass, removing Oatman from US 66. The new route ran along level ground close to the railroad, from Topock to Kingman through Yucca. The bypassing of Oatman lead to the town's decline and near abandonment, while Yucca enjoyed a small period of increased success from US 66 traffic. Oatman Highway remained an undesignated state highway until September 2, 1955, when it was completely transferred to Mohave County. The Wigwam Motel in Holbrook During the late 1940s and early to mid-1950s, the popularity of US 66 greatly increased. There was a great increase in postwar driving, with more people taking the nation's roads than in decades past. To meet the increase in postwar travel, the number of restaurants, gas stations and motels along the route grew. The number of creative attractions and landmarks also grew, in an attempt to attract further tourism, such as the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, where every room was built to resemble a Native American tipi. Other popular tourist attractions and stopping points along the highway included the Two Guns, the Twin Arrows Trading Post, Painted Desert Trading Post and Grand Canyon Caverns. American actor and musician Bobby Troup composed the song \\"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\\", while traveling down the highway with his wife in 1941. This song was later covered by popular musician Nat King Cole who made it into a best selling record. US 66 travelers found useful advice through a guidebook, written by author Jack D. Rittenhouse, titled aptly, A Guide Book to Highway 66. US 66 also became well known for the unusual advertisements placed along the highway by Burma-Shave, a popular shaving cream manufacturer of the time. The era between 1945 and 1956 is often considered the height of popularity of US 66 travel. The popularity of the highway led to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), an American television broadcast network, to air a television show called Route 66 in 1960. =The decline of Route 66= The creation of I-40 marked the decline and eventual end of US 66\\\\. The Arizona State Highway Department had spent a total of $19 million (equivalent to $ in ) on US 66 alone between 1944 and 1954. This was largely due to the gigantic increase in traffic on US 66 through Arizona over the last decade. A Flagstaff-based newspaper once stated that US 66 carried the largest amount of interstate travelers of any highway in Arizona. By 1954, more than one million cars a year were traveling down US 66 from New Mexico to California. The increased traffic had also led to a greater number of car accidents and traffic jams, the latter of which earned US 66 the unfortunate reputation of being \\"The World's Largest Traffic Jam\\". By 1956, at least one out of six deaths resulting from car accidents in Arizona took place on US 66\\\\. This helped the highway earn another negative nickname, \\"Bloody 66\\". The rough shape, narrowness and safety issues along US 66 and similar highways in Arizona contributed to public sentiment towards rebuilding and improving safety along the state's highways. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower heavily endorsed the long-standing idea of constructing a nationwide network of four-lane divided superhighways. Originally proposed back in the 1930s, this system of nationwide freeways would have entirely controlled access through the entry and exit ramps, as well as grade-separated interchanges with other highways, roads, and railroads. The new freeways would also include smoother grades coupled with more gradual curves. These massive changes in highway construction were intended to help increase traffic flow and greatly reduce car accidents occurring on the national highway network. Eisenhower pushed the United States Congress to accept the idea and appropriate funding for the new system. Congress finally approved the proposal with the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, bringing into existence the Interstate and Defense Highway System. Several U.S. Highways in Arizona were chosen to become the corridors for the new Interstates, including US 66, which was slated to be replaced by I-40. By December 1960, approximately of US 66 had been rebuilt into the first section of I-40 to open in Arizona, and a further of US 66 was also undergoing conversion into I-40. By October 1962, of US 66 between Williams and Flagstaff was being rebuilt into parts of I-40. The new section was completed and opened to traffic later the same year. In 1966, a new four-lane steel bridge was opened over the Colorado River, replacing the Red Rock Bridge. US 66 was moved onto the new bridge, running concurrently with the new I-40 across the river. The Red Rock Bridge was closed following the opening of the new bridge and sat completely abandoned for over a decade. Unlike the Old Trails Bridge, the Red Rock Bridge would never be repurposed. In 1976, the bridge was entirely dismantled. Today, only concrete pilings remain where the bridge once stood. By September 1967, over of I-40 had been constructed or rebuilt from sections of US 66, with another under way. I-40 around Flagstaff was completed and opened to traffic in 1968, bypassing US 66 and US 89 through town. By 1971, almost all of US 66 east of Flagstaff had been rebuilt into I-40, save for the city streets through Winslow, Joseph City and Holbrook. I-40 had also been completed around Flagstaff and west to the junction between SR 64 and US 66 east of Williams. Another section of I-40 was complete between Seligman and Ash Fork, with a tiny section completed just east of Ash Fork. Almost all US 66 had been converted into I-40 between Kingman and Topock as well, save for a section east of Topock and a section south of Kingman. A small section of I-40 had also been completed between Kingman and a junction with US 93 about south of Hackberry. The abandoned trading post at Twin Arrows, one of several attractions along US 66 to fall victim to the route's decline Controversy came with the construction of I-40. There was a large opposition to freeway bypasses around the towns along the route. Much of the opposition came from town officials and businessmen, all too familiar with the decline of Oatman caused by the 1952 bypass. A large political effort was mounted across several towns along US 66 to block the construction of any further bypasses. The bypass revolts gained considerable attention in the Arizona State Government, with state legislators considering the idea of banning freeway bypasses in Arizona. In the end, the movements did little to stifle the Interstate construction. However, the movement did give the many communities along US 66 some extra time. The state government agreed not to construct the bypasses until all other sections of I-40 had been completed, in hopes of giving the US 66 towns time to adjust to the upcoming changes. In 1978, the I-40 bypasses were completed around Seligman and Kingman. The Seligman bypass was followed by three bypasses around Ash Fork, Winslow and Holbrook opening in 1979. Despite being open to traffic, the Holbrook bypass would not be completed until 1981. The Joseph City bypass was completed and opened in September 1980. The final bypass was opened around Williams on October 13, 1984, receiving a special ceremony. By far the largest bypass was the section of I-40 constructed between Kingman and Ash Fork. Rather than follow US 66, which formed a roughly arc shaped path through Valentine, Peach Springs and Hackberry, this section of the Interstate went straight east, leaving several communities and a large section of US 66 several miles north of the new main highway. This entire section was completed in 1978. The abandoned zoo ruins at the Two Guns ghost town along former US 66 As I-40 replaced US 66, the old highway's popularity greatly declined. Business along the route began declining as fewer and fewer people drove through the old towns. Slowly, many towns declined or were outright abandoned and became ghost towns, including tourist towns like Two Guns. Many residents of the declining US 66 towns described the loss of business being instantaneous, happening right after the bypasses opened. The Interstate bypasses also meant the end of US 66 as an active highway, in conjunction with California concurrently removing its section of US 66 from the state highway system between 1964 and 1974, which moved the western terminus of the entire highway to the Colorado River in Topock, Arizona. The same year, US 66 was also truncated in the east from Chicago to Joplin, Missouri. Despite California's lack of recognition of US 66 as an active highway, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) recognized the new western terminus of the highway at US 95 in Needles, across the river from Topock. The section of US 66 through Arizona remained unaltered until 1979, when AASHTO approved a request from California and Arizona to truncate US 66 from Needles to a junction with I-40 and US 666 in Sanders. However, the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) continued to recognize the US 66 designation west of Sanders, establishing a signed western terminus at I-40 in Kingman. Following the completion of the Williams bypass in 1984, ADOT approved a plan to deal with the remains of the highway in Arizona. All of US 66 in Arizona was no longer recognized as an active U.S. Highway. The sections of US 66 that were not concurrent with I-40 were re-designated as multiple Business Loops of I-40 and the section of highway from Kingman to Seligman was re-designated State Route 66. The section from Seligman to Crookton was abandoned to Yavapai County. On June 26, 1985, AASHTO approved a request by the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri to retire the US 66 designation from the U.S. Highway System. =Historic Route 66= A Seligman-based small business owner named Angel Delgadillo had observed the impact that the decline of US 66 and establishment of the I-40 bypass had on his town. Delgadillo, a Seligman native, had been operating his privately owned barbershop since 1950. When I-40 had been completed around Seligman, the number of cars traveling through Seligman substantially decreased from thousands per day to only a handful per day. This also meant a great decrease in Delgadillo's business. By 1986, Delgadillo had been attempting for years to get former US 66 in Arizona designated as a historic route with little to no success. The same year, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ended employee layovers in Seligman, decreasing Delgadillo's business even further. Field example of an ADOT Historic Route 66 sign and State Scenic Road marker in Mohave County On February 18, 1987, Delgadillo organized a meeting of 15 small business owners with establishments along old US 66\\\\. Among the attendees was Delagdillo's older brother, Juan Delgadillo, who owned Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In just down the street from Angel's barber shop. The businessmen met at the Copper Cart Canyon restaurant in downtown Seligman and agreed to form the Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona. The new association began lobbying and meeting with state level politicians as well as multiple chambers of commerce for support. Delgadillo even began selling US 66 themed merchandise at his barber shop to gather further support. The efforts of the new association paid off in November 1987, when the Arizona State Transportation Board designated several sections of old US 66 as Historic Route 66. The victory was marked by a ceremonial ribbon cutting for the new historic route in Seligman on April 23, 1988. This event was also the beginning of the first annual Route 66 Fun Run, an event where historic cars drive together down Historic Route 66 from Seligman to Kingman. The success of Historic Route 66 made Angel Delgadillo a popular figure among Route 66 enthusiasts around the world. Delgadillo has since been hailed as the \\"Guardian Angel of Route 66\\" and \\"Mayor of the Mother Road\\", among other nicknames. Angel Delgadillo and his brother Juan Delgadillo sitting on old US 66 near Seligman The ADOT Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads program continues to recognize certain sections of former US 66 as Historic Route 66. The longest sections of the designated historic route follow the original US 66 between Topock and Seligman through Oatman and from Flagstaff to Winona. Other smaller sections of Historic Route 66 comprise former US 66 segments that are currently or were once designated as I-40 Business. This is the case in Ash Fork, Williams, Winslow and Holbrook. Flagstaff is the only city in Arizona where the Historic Route splits into two alignments, the first along the aforementioned route to Winona and the second taking a small section of later US 66 to a junction with I-40 immediately east of Flagstaff. The discontinuous sections of Historic Route 66 are all connected by I-40. As there are no designated sections between Holbrook and New Mexico, the Arizona historic route officially has its eastern terminus in Holbrook. Former US 66 also has the honor of being designated part of the Historic Route 66 National Scenic Byway. The designation means the old highway is protected and preserved as both a National Scenic Byway and All-American Road under the supervision of the Federal Highway Administration. There is also a museum dedicated to Historic Route 66 at the Powerhouse Visitor Center in Kingman. A further byway designation was granted to the original section of US 66 through Oatman, designated the Route 66 Historic Back Country Byway by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the BLM's Back Country Byways system. The overall length of all combined sections of Historic Route 66 is . Until the addition of Historic U.S. Route 80 in 2018, Historic Route 66 was the only route in the Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads program to span multiple counties, and was the longest state-designated historic route in Arizona. Similar to US 66, US 80 was once a heavily traveled transcontinental U.S. Highway with an iconic car culture until Interstates bypassed and replaced it. Historic Route 66 is one of Arizona's four state designated Historic Routes, with the others being Historic US 80, the Jerome-Clarkdale-Cottonwood Historic Road (Historic US 89A) and the Apache Trail Historic Road.  Major intersections  This list follows the final non-freeway alignment in 1960.

Long a symbol of forced assimilation, the historic building is now the property of the Hualapai Nation. and The Peach Springs Trading Post, constructed in 1928 using local stone and logs, replaced an earlier 1917 trading post at Peach Springs. Its original role was to trade native crafts for foodstuffs, medicine and household goods. The building now houses Hualapai conservation offices. Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In in Seligman Lowell Observatory, an astronomical observatory established in Flagstaff in 1894, is one of the oldest observatories in the United States and a designated National Historic Landmark. The observatory is well known for being the location where astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered the dwarf planet Pluto on February 18, 1930. Flagstaff's Santa Fe Railway Depot, built in 1926, is currently an Amtrak station and includes a visitor information office. Flagstaff's 43-room Hotel Monte Vista was established in 1927 and is believed to be a filming location for the 1942 film Casablanca, starring actor Humphrey Bogart. = Historic districts = * Kingman Commercial Historic District, Kingman * Seligman Historic District, Seligman * Railroad Addition Historic District, Flagstaff * La Posada Historic District in Winslow, which dates from 1930, includes the Winslow Santa Fe station as well as La Posada Hotel and Gardens, a Fred Harvey Company hotel. = Restaurants = National Archive image of Historic Route 66 Galaxy Diner, Flagstaff Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In in Seligman, was built in 1953 with scrap railway lumber by Juan Delgadillo.

It continues to offer choices such as a \\"cheeseburger with cheese\\" and \\"dead chicken.\\" The Galaxy Diner along the route in Flagstaff is a popular fixture. It had opened in the 1950s and retained the small-town diner iconography despite popular franchises replacing many restaurants; it was refitted to better emulate its original era in the 1990s. The diner closed on August 2, 2019, then re-opened under new ownership in August 2020. = Camps, motor courts, and motels = The Oatman Hotel, a historic two-story adobe building which opened in 1902 as the Durlin Hotel and was rebuilt in 1924 during a local gold rush now houses a bar, restaurant and museum. The Wigwam Village Motel in Holbrook is distinctive for patented novelty architecture in which every room of the motel is a free-standing concrete wigwam. In Pixar's 2006 animated film Cars, these are depicted as the traffic cones of the Cozy Cone Motel. The Pueblo Revival style Painted Desert Inn in Navajo, constructed circa-1920 of wood and native stone, and purchased by the US National Park Service in 1935, is situated on a mesa overlooking the vast Painted Desert. About from Kingman in Antares, Arizona is the Kozy Corner RV park, which features the 'Giganticus Headicus' attraction, a 14-foot tall homemade monument resembling the Easter Island heads. The park is on Antares Point, the longest continuous curve (c. 2 miles) of any United States highway. The RV park is isolated, bracketed between the Peacock Mountains and Route 66 and the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway, which run parallel; it began as a camp for railroad workers in the early 1900s. A local legend claims that Gene Roddenberry stayed at the motel and named the Antares ship in Star Trek after its location. = Bridges = Trails Arch Bridge in Topock * Old Trails Bridge, Topock * Walnut Canyon Bridge, Winona * Querino Canyon Bridge, Houck = Road segments = *Various segments of old US 66 throughout Arizona, in various states of preservation, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The scandal involved eight players and all were suspended for life. They were not guilty of the scandal but were suspended for life for being around the shady characters. =1877 Louisville Grays scandal= After a losing streak towards the end of the season cost the Louisville Grays the pennant, members of the team were discovered to have thrown games for money. Four players, including star pitcher Jim Devlin, were banned from professional baseball for life. =1908 bribery attempt= On the eve of the \\"playoff\\" or \\"makeup\\" game between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants that would decide the National League championship, an umpire refused an attempted bribe intended to help the Giants win. The Giants lost to the Cubs, and the matter was kept fairly quiet. It came out the following spring, but the results of the official inquiry were kept secret. However, the Giants' team physician for 1908 was reportedly the culprit and was banned for life. Recent research has suggested that the team physician was allowed to be the \\"scapegoat\\"; some baseball historians now suspect that the Giants' manager, John McGraw, was behind the physician's bribe attempt, or that it may in fact have been McGraw himself who approached the umpire. If true, and had it become known, it could have been disastrous, as McGraw was such a prominent figure in the game. =1914 World Series upset= The four-game sweep of the Philadelphia Athletics by the Boston Braves in the 1914 World Series was stunning. Students of that Series suspect that the Athletics were angry at their notoriously miserly owner, Connie Mack, and that the A's players did not give the Series their best effort. Although such an allegation was never proven, Mack apparently thought that it was at least a strong possibility, and he soon traded or sold all of the stars away from that 1914 team. The A's team was decimated, and within two years they limped to the worst single-season win- loss percentage in modern baseball history (36-117, .235); it would be over a decade before they recovered. =1917‚Äì1918 suspicions= The manner in which the New York Giants lost to the Chicago White Sox in the 1917 World Series raised some suspicions. A key play in the final game involved Heinie Zimmerman chasing Eddie Collins across an unguarded home plate. Immediately afterward, Zimmerman (who had also hit only .120 during the Series) denied throwing the game or the Series. Within two years, Zimmerman and his corrupt teammate Hal Chase would be suspended for life, not so much due to any one incident but to a series of questionable actions and associations. The fact that the question of throwing the Series was even raised suggests the level of public consciousness of gamblers' potential influence on the game. Then, just a year ahead of the infamous Black Sox scandal, there were rumors of World Series fixing by members of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs lost the 1918 Series in a sparsely-attended affair that also nearly resulted in a players' strike demanding more than the normal gate receipts. With World War I dominating the news (as well as having shortened the regular baseball season and having caused attendance to shrink) the unsubstantiated rumors were allowed to dissipate. =1919 conspiracy= The 1919 World Series resulted in the most famous scandal in baseball history, often referred to as the Black Sox Scandal. Eight players from the Chicago White Sox (nicknamed the Black Sox) were accused of throwing the series against the Cincinnati Reds. Details of the scandal remain controversial, and the extent to which each player was said to be involved varied. It was, however, front-page news across the country when the story was uncovered late in the 1920 season, and despite being acquitted of criminal charges (throwing baseball games was technically not a crime), the eight players were banned from organized baseball (i.e. the leagues subject to the National Agreement) for life. Although betting had been an ongoing problem in baseball since the 1870s, it reached a head in this scandal, resulting in radical changes in the game's organization. It resulted in the appointment of a Commissioner of Baseball (Kenesaw Mountain Landis) who took firm steps to try to rid the game of gambling influence permanently. One important step was the lifetime ban against the Black Sox Scandal participants. The \\"eight men out\\" were the great \\"natural hitter\\" \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson; pitchers Eddie Cicotte and \\"Lefty\\" Williams; infielders \\"Buck\\" Weaver, \\"Chick\\" Gandil, Fred McMullin, and \\"Swede\\" Risberg; and outfielder \\"Happy\\" Felsch. Jackson, who was suspended during the peak of his career with a .356 lifetime batting average (all-time third), is still regarded as one of the greatest players not in the Hall of Fame. 1919 aftermath After the 1919 scandal and some further game-fixing incidents in 1920 had been resolved, and with Landis having taken over, the gambling problem apparently went away, for the most part, for decades. Commissioners have taken an almost fanatical interest in the subject, suspending well-known individuals for lengthy times just for having been seen with gamblers; Leo Durocher, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was suspended by Commissioner Happy Chandler for the 1947 season for just that reason. After their retirement, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays served for a while as greeters at legal Atlantic City gambling casinos. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn issued a ban against them. New Jersey state gaming regulators harshly criticized Kuhn's decision, while newspaper articles of the time pointed out that Mantle and Mays played before there were large player salaries. Their bans were lifted during Commissioner Peter Ueberroth's term. =1980s Pete Rose betting scandal= In March 1989, Pete Rose, baseball's all-time hits leader and manager of the Cincinnati Reds since 1984, was reported by Sports Illustrated as betting on Major League games, including Reds games, while he was the manager. Rose had been questioned about his gambling activities in February 1989 by outgoing commissioner Peter Ueberroth and his successor, National League president A. Bartlett Giamatti. Three days later, lawyer John M. Dowd was retained to investigate the charges against Rose. During the investigation, Giamatti took office as the commissioner of baseball. The Dowd Report asserted that Pete Rose bet on 52 Reds games in 1987, at a minimum of $10,000 a day. Rose, facing a very harsh punishment, along with his attorney and agent, Reuven Katz, decided to seek a compromise with Major League Baseball. On August 24, 1989, Rose agreed to a voluntary lifetime ban from baseball. The agreement had three key provisions: # Major League Baseball would make no finding of fact regarding gambling allegations and cease their investigation; # Rose was neither admitting or denying the charges; and # Rose could apply for reinstatement after one year. Despite the \\"no finding of fact\\" provision, Giamatti immediately stated publicly that he felt that Rose bet on baseball games. Eight days later, September 1, Giamatti suffered a fatal heart attack. The consensus among baseball experts is that Giamatti's post-agreement statement, his sudden and untimely death, and appointment of new commissioner, Fay Vincent, a close friend and great admirer of Giamatti, doomed Pete Rose's hopes of reinstatement. Bud Selig, the former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, succeeded Vincent in 1992. Rose has applied for reinstatement twice: in September 1997 and March 2003. In both instances, commissioner Selig chose not to act, thereby keeping the ban intact. Upon Selig's retirement from the Commissioner's Office, Rose applied for reinstatement in March 2015, but Selig's successor Rob Manfred denied the request in December of that year. On February 4, 1991, Rose's ban from baseball was extended to the Baseball Hall of Fame, when the twelve members of the board of directors of the Hall voted unanimously to bar Rose from the ballot. However, Major League Baseball allowed Rose to be a part of the All- Century Team celebration in 1999 since he was named one of the team's outfielders. In 2004, after years of speculation and denial, Rose admitted in his book My Prison Without Bars that the accusations that he had bet on Reds games were true and that he had admitted it to Selig personally some time before. He stated that he always bet on the Reds, never against them.Pete Rose#Coming clean  1980s collusion  Repeatedly in the 1980s, MLB owners colluded to keep player salaries down. Over multiple instances the owners were found to have stolen nearly $400 million from the players. When the Major League Baseball players struck in 1994, the owners were found to have committed unfair labor practices in attempting to keep player salaries down again. Substance abuse Baseball has had its share of problems with substance abuse from the inception. Prior to the 1970s, there were countless individual problems with alcohol abuse, but as alcohol was a legal substance during most of that time (except for the Prohibition era), alcohol was typically seen as a character weakness on the part of individuals. Public awareness of illegal drugs accelerated during the 1970s, and by the 1980s a number of players had become caught up. =1985 cocaine scandal= Pittsburgh Pirates players Dave Parker, Dale Berra, Rod Scurry, Lee Mazzilli, Lee Lacy, and John Milner, as well as non-Pirates Willie Mays Aikens, Vida Blue, Enos Cabell, Keith Hernandez, Jeffrey Leonard, Tim Raines, and Lonnie Smith, were summoned to appear before a Pittsburgh grand jury. Their testimony led to the Pittsburgh Drug Trials, which made national headlines in September 1985. The spotlight on the \\"Pittsburgh problem\\" by the national media led to the more widespread awareness of use of other drugs such as amphetamines (\\"greenies\\" in baseball vernacular) and marijuana in the game. Both have a long history in baseball; Milner (who had retired two years earlier due to recurring hamstring injuries), in fact, spoke of Willie Mays and Willie Stargell, both iconic figures and Baseball Hall of Famers, giving him \\"greenies\\". Testimony revealed that drug dealers frequented the Pirates' clubhouse. Stories such as Rod Scurry leaving a game in the late innings to look for cocaine and John Milner buying two grams of cocaine for $200 in the bathroom stalls at Three Rivers Stadium during a 1980 game against the Houston Astros shocked the grand jurors. Even Kevin Koch, who played the Pirates' mascot, was implicated for buying cocaine and introducing players to a drug dealer. Ultimately, seven drug dealers pleaded guilty on various charges. On February 28, 1986, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended a number of players for varying lengths of time. A primary condition of reinstatement was public service. It would have also included urine tests, but the players union was able to successfully halt its implementation. To this day, drug testing, particularly of this sort, is a polarizing issue. Rod Scurry died at age 36 on November 5, 1992 in a Reno, Nevada intensive care unit of a heart attack after a cocaine-fueled incident with police officers led to his hospitalization. =2005‚Äì2006 steroids investigations= The steroids rumors and facts resulted in several de facto bans from the game by players who were either certifiable or suspected users of steroids, and significant doubt has been cast about the quality of various baseball records set since at least the early 1990s. Some people base their opinion on Jose Canseco's tell-all book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big. =2013 Biogenesis scandal= In 2013, twenty Major League Baseball (MLB) players were accused of using HGH after obtaining it from the clinic Biogenesis of America. Milwaukee Brewers star Ryan Braun, who had a drug-related suspension overturned in 2011, made a deal with MLB and accepted a 65-game ban. Two weeks later, New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez was suspended through the 2014 season (211 games), and 12 other players were suspended for 50 games. It was the most players ever suspended at one time by MLB. Sign stealing scandals In 2019, Mike Fiers of the Oakland Athletics spoke to Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drelich of The Athletic where he revealed the Astros had been electronically stealing signs since at least the 2017 season. After an investigation by MLB, Astros manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were each suspended for one year from MLB. In addition, the Astros were fined $5 million and lost their first- and second-round draft picks for the 2020 and 2021 MLB drafts. After the news broke, Astros owner Jim Crane fired both Hinch and Lunhow. Hinch admitted to knowing about the scheme and discouraging it, but not reporting or stopping it. Both Carlos Beltr√°n and Alex Cora were also implicated in the report by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred. The Boston Red Sox, managed by Cora beginning in the 2018 season, were also accused in a story on The Athletic of having their own sign stealing scheme. On January 14, 2020, Cora and the Red Sox agreed to \\"mutually part ways\\". In a statement after the news Cora said, \\"I do not want to be a distraction\\". The report on the Red Sox scheme was not released before the decision. Two days later, Beltr√°n and the New York Mets came to a similar parting of the ways; the Mets had hired him as the team's new manager less than three months earlier. On April 22, 2020, MLB suspended Red Sox video replay system operator J.T. Watkins without pay through the 2020 postseason and stripped the team of its second-round draft pick this year after completing an investigation into allegations that Boston stole signs during the 2018 season. Alex Cora was also suspended through the 2020 postseason, but only for his conduct as Houston's bench coach https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29083660/mlb-suspends-red-sox-replay- operator-1-year-docks-draft-pick-punishment-sign-stealing-scandal See also *List of people banned from Major League Baseball *Doping in baseball *Game of Shadows References ;Notes ;Sources *Eight Men Out, by Eliot Asinof * *Book review of My Prison Without Bars from bookreporter.com Scandals ","title":"Major League Baseball scandals"},{"id":"4987644","text":"Oliver Hampton Smith (October 23, 1794March 19, 1859) was a United States Representative and Senator from Indiana.

Louden and his co-host Jon Lung won the hosting on the reality television competition series Mythbusters: The Search, which aired in January and February 2016. Former cast Recurring experts are also sometimes referred to as \\"Honorary MythBusters\\". =Jamie Hyneman= Jamie Hyneman is a main cast member on MythBusters, along with Adam Savage. His demeanor on the show is calm, logical and no-nonsense, in stark contrast to Savage's more animated, impulsive and energetic persona. Hyneman is often exasperated by Savage's antics and he sometimes argues with him about the best approach to take. The two often have very different ideas for performing experiments and building devices. Hyneman's ideas tend to be more simplified than his co-host's, and he has a philosophy of reducing a solution to its most basic form, wherever possible. This difference has led to numerous competitions between the two presenters when testing myths, such as testing the \\"Goldfish Memory\\" myth and the \\"Levitation Machine\\" myth. In numerous interviews, both Jamie and Adam have stated one of the reasons for the show's success is this dichotomy, and the fact that they can't stand each other, with their professional relationship being based more on mutual respect for each other's work. In a 2015 interview both said that they have completely separate lives, rarely, if ever, interacting with each other outside the show. Even while on set, they don't share meals or talk to each other off-camera. If there is an argument, they hash it out and move on, and they stated that while such arguments were a part of the early seasons, they successfully lobbied to have such situations on-camera significantly reduced. A distinctive part of his appearance is his dark beret, white long-sleeve button-up shirt over a black T-shirt, no-rim glasses, and occasionally, mirrored sunglasses with side anti-glare guards. This, along with his walrus-style mustache and deep voice, are constant subjects for jokes by co-host Adam Savage and other team members. A sign hanging in his workshop reading \\"Clean Up or Die\\", visible in several episodes, expresses his desire to keep the shop clean and tidy. In the \\"AC vs. Windows Down\\" myth, Hyneman revealed a food that he developed known as \\"the 444\\", a smoothie-like concoction of four fruits, four vegetables, and four grains. Despite skepticism by the rest of the crew, Hyneman described the 444's taste as \\"quite pleasant\\". =Adam Savage= Adam Savage has been involved in MythBusters since its creation. Savage's demeanour on MythBusters is animated and energetic, providing a foil to Jamie Hyneman's more reserved straight man persona. Savage and Hyneman were the only hosts of the show for the first season of MythBusters. Starting with the second season, members of Hyneman's staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes; Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and welder Scottie Chapman appeared in the second season. In the third season, Chapman was replaced by Grant Imahara, a robot builder and model maker. In an interview Savage gave during The Amaz!ng Meeting 5, he expressed an interest in proving natural selection over creationism on MythBusters. Savage also stated that such an episode is unlikely because MythBusters has a policy against trying to disprove supernatural phenomena. =Kari Byron= Kari Byron was a co-host until 2014 with fellow co-hosts of the \\"Build Team,\\" Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara. She and the others also hosted their own segments. She became involved in the show after persistently showing up at Hyneman's M5 Industries workshop in a desire to get hired by his company. She and the other Build Team members were given a more prominent role beginning with the show's second season. Not having had a long history in show business, Byron at first found it difficult to act naturally with this more visible position but gradually became more accustomed to it. During the second half of the 2009 season, Byron was on maternity leave and was temporarily replaced by Jessi Combs. In 2010-2011, Byron had her own show, Head Rush, on the Science Channel, geared towards science education and teens. Byron has also hosted the 2010 and 2011 editions of Large, Dangerous Rocket Ships for the Science Channel. She and Belleci made a guest appearance on the October 3, 2012 episode of the Discovery series Sons of Guns. They test fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop and watched as the staff retested a myth previously busted by the Build Team: that a propane tank could explode if struck by a bullet. On August 21, 2014, it was announced that Byron, along with co-stars Grant Imahara and Tory Belleci, would be leaving MythBusters. =Tory Belleci= Tory Belleci is often considered by fellow MythBusters Kari Byron and Grant Imahara to be more of a daredevil and, as such, often performs the more dangerous stunts when testing a myth. These have included: testing the \\"Red Flag to a Bull\\" myth; testing the myth that a human's tongue will instantly stick to a frozen pole, in the \\"Frozen Tongue\\" myth; and the \\"Underwater Blow Dart\\" myth. One of his more popular stunts, shown several times on the show, was an attempt to jump over a toy wagon on a bicycle; the attempt failed, resulting in Belleci flipping forward, landing on his face and skidding across the pavement, only to immediately respond with an \\"I'm okay\\". As a result of doing these stunts, he is often involved in comical accidents while testing myths. According to the October 28, 2012 episode of MythBusters, he suffers from acrophobia. During the \\"Fall Guys\\" myth, Belleci fell off a roof, and despite being strapped into a safety harness system, landed in an open window ledge below the drop point, and injured his leg causing substantial bleeding. He and Byron made a guest appearance on the October 3, 2012 episode of the Discovery series Sons of Guns. They test fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop and watched as the staff retested a myth previously busted by the Build Team: that a propane tank could explode if struck by a bullet. On August 21, 2014, it was announced that Belleci, along with co-stars Byron and Imahara, would be leaving MythBusters. =Grant Imahara= Grant Imahara joined MythBusters on the invitation of friend and occasional employer Jamie Hyneman and former ILM colleague Linda Wolkovitch. He joined as the third member of the Build Team, replacing former MythBusters welder Scottie Chapman. His colleagues often jokingly referred to him as the \\"geek\\" of the Build Team. He often made the robots that are needed for the show and otherwise specialized in operating the computers and electronics for the myths. On August 21, 2014, it was announced that Grant, along with co- stars Kari Byron and Tory Belleci, would be leaving MythBusters. He died on July 13, 2020, after suffering from a brain aneurysm. =Christine Chamberlain= Christine Chamberlain was a \\"MythTern\\" (portmanteau of MythBusters and intern) who joined the MythBusters team as a result of a Discovery Channel contest and was present for the second season of MythBusters. She was mostly Jamie and Adam's assistant in myths\\"Exploding Jawbreaker\\"\\"Ping Pong Salvage\\" and stayed on the show until season 3. =Scottie Chapman= Scottie Chapman (born 1971) is a former member of the Build Team who was called the \\"Mistress of Metal\\" for her work in welding and metal craft. Notable for her tattoos (which were used for a myth investigation in one episode), she departed after the third season. On her MySpace blog, she revealed that she would not be back as a regular, but appeared in the \\"Supersize Rocket Car\\", as well as The Great Ice Debate myth. She also made an appearance in one episode broadcast after her departure that involved an experiment, executed over a number of months, which began when she was with the show and ended after she had left (Episode Breaking Glass, Myth \\"Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss\\"). =Jessi Combs= Jessi Combs was a cast member on the Build Team for a short time. Her arrival was announced on July 31, 2009, by the Discovery Channel when co-host Kari Byron went on maternity leave prior to giving birth to her first child. Byron left the show on the episode \\"Dumpster Diving\\" and Combs replaced her on the show. Combs was an American television personality and metal fabricator who appeared from 2005‚Äì2008 on the Spike show Xtreme 4x4 which is a part of the Powerblock on Spike. Combs was cast as a co-host of Xtreme 4x4 along with Ian Johnson after an international search which required contestants to send audition videos to Spike. Prior to appearing on Xtreme 4x4 she appeared on the TLC program Overhaulin' as a guest fabricator. After high school Combs turned down a scholarship to attend an interior design school. In 2004 she graduated from WyoTech in the Collision & Refinishing Core Program at the top of her class. She also took the Street Rod Fabrication and Custom Fabrication and High Performance Powertrain programs. Combs died in August 2019 in a crash of a jet-powered high-speed race car in southeastern Oregon while attempting to set a new four-wheel land speed record, which was posthumously awarded to her in June 2020 by Guinness World Records. =Jessie Nelson= Jessie Nelson, or simply Jess, was a \\"MythTern\\" (portmanteau of MythBusters and intern). She made her first appearance on MythBusters during the \\"Archimedes' Death Ray\\" episode as part of the girls' team on the small scale build-off. She appeared again in the \\"Whirlpool of Death\\" myth where she was introduced as a \\"MythTern\\". In that episode she assisted Adam with the building of scale models to test the whirlpool, and towards the end of the episode got to hold his hand as he vomited in the whirlpool tank, adding her own memorable quote to MythBusters: \\"Smells like pizza\\". She then appeared in the \\"Mega Movie Myths\\" episode, where she helped find a car for the use with the ejector seat myth; Once again, she was cited as a \\"MythTern\\". She also appeared in \\"Air Cylinder of Death\\", \\"Christmas Lights\\", \\"Hindenburg Mystery\\", \\"Western Myths\\", \\"Walking on Water\\", \\"Birds in a Truck\\", \\"Bifurcated Boat\\", mixing the non-Newtonian fluid, \\"Pirate Special\\", \\"Special Supersized Myths\\", and \\"Superhero Hour\\". Staff =Robert Lee= Robert Lee (born ) is the narrator of the series, who shares the job of explaining experiments and facts with the hosts, often using a copious number of puns and humor. In some regions‚Äîsuch as the United Kingdom and Scandinavia‚Äîhe is replaced by Irish and British narrators Robin Banks or Daisy Beaumont. Rufus Hound narrates the version of the show that aired on the BBC. He returns to narrate the revival MythBusters: The Search as well, and followed this with the narration for Mythbusters Junior. This makes him the longest continuous serving member of the franchise. =Eric Haven= Eric Haven is a former comic book artist who draws the blueprint drawings used to introduce each episode, as was revealed in the 2012 season's \\"Mailbag Special\\". He took over the job from the MythBusters (Savage and Hyneman) and the former Build Team (Byron, Belleci, and Imahara). He has been a researcher for the program for 33 episodes from 2004 to 2005 and served as an associate producer from 2005 until 2012 for 143 episodes. Since the broadcast of Season 13, he has been credited as a producer for the show.Eric Haven - IMDb.

Non-human assistants =Buster= Buster is a Hybrid II model crash test dummy that plays an important role in many experiments by taking the place of a human subject in the more dangerous myth tests. The first and most recognized of the dummies used in the show, Buster was introduced in the beginning of the first season for the \\"Exploding Toilet\\" myth. Savage had purchased the dummy to take the place of Hyneman (who had second thoughts about testing the myth because he realized the foam he would be using was flammable), and Hyneman gave it its name. Because of the nature of the situations in which the MythBusters use him, Buster has been subjected to forces and situations that far exceed his original design parameters as an automobile crash test dummy. As a testament to the danger of the tests in which he is used‚Äîoften resulting in his being broken into pieces, burnt, or otherwise mutilated‚ÄîBuster has had to be extensively repaired and rebuilt over the course of the series to the point that the episode \\"Buster Special\\" was devoted to his being completely redesigned and rebuilt as \\"Buster 2.0\\". Buster was designed with quick and simple repair in mind, and boasts improved joints, with a more realistic range of movement, and easily replaceable poplar wood \\"bones\\". Poplar was chosen because its shear strength was very similar to human bone, providing an accurate gauge of how bones would react in experiments. Buster's new flesh (with the exception of his face, hands, and feet) is made of a silicone marketed for use in animatronics called Dragon Skin. Buster's original head was retained when he was rebuilt, but it had to be replaced after it was shattered during a mishap on the \\"Escape Slide Parachute\\" myth. His original face was retained to fit over his replacement head. They tested Buster 2.0 by dropping him 60 feet (about 20 meters) off a crane while inside a donated Cadillac named Earl. The MythBusters have at times adapted Buster to fit specialized equipment or give him new functionality. For myths involving holding onto things (such as \\"Plywood Builder\\"), his hands are replaced with clamps or quick-release rigs. For myths involving falls (like \\"Hammer Bridge Drop\\"), monitoring equipment, such as accelerometers or shock gauges, is installed on or within his body. He was also attached to a pneumatic system at one time so he could punch sharks for the \\"Shark Punching\\" myth. Just before testing the revisited \\"Jet Taxi\\" myth, Buster spoke two lines as chosen by fans: \\"Adam, I am your father,\\" followed by \\"I wonder if Mike Rowe is hiring,\\" a reference to the host of Discovery's other popular show, Dirty Jobs. In October 2007, the fan site also uploaded a video spoof of Buster's life\\"Behind the Story\\" narrated by Jim Forbes of Behind the Music and starring Tory, Grant, Kari and Adam. As Grant once noted, there are very few times when Buster is actually used for his original purpose (a crash test dummy) on MythBusters. Since his introduction on the show (in something of a running joke) the cast refer to Buster as if he were an actual living person, and consider him a full member of the cast in his own right. On several myths that involved long drops or intense forces in which Buster was damaged, Adam and others expressed dismay and concern over Buster having been damaged so extensively, most notably during the \\"Escape Slide Parachute\\" myth. On the \\"Viewer Special 2\\" episode, a new Buster was introduced. This Buster is a former crash test dummy provided by Dayton T. Brown, Inc. The new Buster was named \\"Buster 2.0\\"‚Äînot to be confused with the remodeled \\"Buster 1.0\\". The original Buster has been retired. During the James Bond special, Buster was dressed up in a tuxedo when he was used for the exploding propane myth. In most myths involving people, Buster is usually dressed in whatever clothes are relevant to the myth (e.g. a police uniform, farmer's overalls, etc.) to give him more character and an air of faux authenticity. In more recent episodes, the hosts of the show as well as the narrator appear to have taken up a policy of calling any human-analogue \\"Buster\\" (not just the specific crash test dummies given the name). However, this practice is very rarely, if at all, applied to dummies made out of ballistics gel or otherwise used to represent human tissue (such as pigs). In the series finale, Buster is attached to a rocket sled and launched toward a concrete block wall at a speed of over Mach one, disintegrating on impact. Adam subsequently recovers some of the fragments and gives them to Jamie and the Build Team in a follow-up reunion special. =Simulaids= Simulaids are Buster's family of at least four dummies, dubbed \\"Randy\\" or \\"Rescue Randy\\" (father), \\"Jane\\" (mother), \\"Suzy\\" or \\"Simulated Suzy\\" (daughter), and an unnamed son. Rescue Randy has also been referred to as \\"Ted\\" (for Bus-Ted, Annihila-Ted, Humilia-Ted, and so on). These were added partly because Buster (even after his redesign) was becoming increasingly difficult to repair, and also because not all myths can be accurately tested with Buster due to his size, weight, and other factors. For instance, Suzy (a child dummy) was used to test the myth that a child could go 360 degrees around a swing set. Being representative of an adult man, Buster would not have properly fit the criteria for the myth. The Simulaids were first introduced in the Killer Brace Position myth, primarily because multiple dummies were needed for testing. At least one Simulaid has been destroyed in the course of subsequent experiments (In the \\"Point Break\\" trilogy the Simulaid was destroyed when it hit the ground from 4000 feet). Additionally, a dummy named Ariel (pun on \\"aerial\\") was used testing whether a human in a freefall could propel a six-year-old girl off a seesaw onto a 7-story building. =Ted= Ted is an extra crash-test dummy used in the show. In addition to this, any full-size human made from ballistics gelatin is usually named Ted, from the last syllable of bus-ted, annihila-ted, exploi-ted.As explained in the \\"22,000 Foot Fall\\" myth. One instance of Ted's use was in the \\"Train Suction\\" myth, in which he played the unsuspecting commuter. =Deadblow= Deadblow, Grant Imahara's battlebot, has been used to aid the MythBusters in various ways, such as measuring vibrations in the ground (for the \\"Chinese Invasion Alarm\\" myth) to being a cat decoy (in the \\"Beat the Guard Dog\\" myth). Grant temporarily renamed the robot \\"Blinky\\" and fitted it with a set of headlights to simulate an oncoming vehicle for the \\"Driving in the Dark\\" myth. =Earl= Earl was a Cadillac donated by MythBusters fan Ben Rillie who had been used in many episodes such as the \\"Car Capers\\" myth. Originally destined to be destroyed by the exploding gas tank, its failure to explode allowed Earl to be used to test myths in subsequent episodes. It was finally destroyed when it was dropped nose-down from 60 feet in the air to test the resilience of a remodeled Buster, and to satisfy the cast's promise to Ben that they would do their best to destroy the car. =Sparky= Sparky was a robot used multiple times on the show. In the \\"Gunpowder Keg\\" myth, Jamie took the motor and wheels from an electric wheelchair and fitted it with a metal hood for protection, a remote control, and a stand for a keg of gunpowder. The MythBusters drilled a hole in the keg and lit the ensuing trail of gunpowder on fire to see if the fire would travel up the falling stream of gunpowder and explode the keg. After many trials, the myth was called plausible, and Sparky survived. Sparky was used again in both the \\"Hot Bullets\\" and the \\"Campfire Chaos\\" myths to drop bullets of various caliber as well as aerosol cans into a campfire to see if they could cause serious injury or death. Sparky was not damaged, but it was determined that both bullets and bug spray could cause injury but would be unlikely to kill someone if dropped into a campfire. =Chip= Chip was the ballistic gel dummy who assisted in testing the \\"Phone in a Thunderstorm\\" myth. Chip was placed inside a miniature faux house built by the Mythbusters which was placed within a facility used to test the effects of lightning. After attaching a monitor to detect the amount of electricity running through Chip's heart, he was attached to a phone and placed in the shower with running water in separate experiements while simulated bolts of lightning struck wiring which lead directly into the house. The fuse was blown on the meter attached to Chip during each experiment, which led the team to assume the amount of electricity through Chip's heart was deadly. Thanks to Chip's sacrifice, the team concluded that the \\"Phone in a Thunderstorm\\" myth was confirmed as being potentially deadly, and the Shower in a Thunderstorm myth was deemed plausible as a dangerous or even deadly situation. =Mythdog Bo= Mythdog Bo is a small dog that appears in the 2017 revival of the show. She does not provide much help and only appears when she walks on set, and her random appearances have caused some jokes. =Buster II/Jr= Buster Jr is the version of Buster in the 2017 version of the show. He was introduced in the second episode, where they needed a criminal to block a propane chimney. They needed the replacement after the original was fired into a brick wall with a rocket.

Early years Born Rosalind Ashford on September 2, 1943, to John and Mary AshfordThe Original Vandellas in Detroit, Michigan, Ashford sang in church choirs and learned to dance in local centers. Developing a passion for music, she joined the glee club and mixed choruses while attending Wilbur Wright High School.http://jreedent.com/The_Original_Vandellas.html According to Ashford, in 1957 her mother and sister helped land her an audition at a local Detroit YMCA club, where a man named Edward \\"Pops\\" Larkins recruited her, Annette Beard and Gloria Williams to form a sister group to a male vocal group. Martha Reeves, contrary to belief, was not an original member of The Del-Phis, as she was a member of another group. Reeves would not join until 1960. Naming themselves The Del-Phis, the group performed in local benefit parties throughout Detroit and performed at YMCA parties and high school functions before the group became serious about music around 1960 shortly after Reeves joined the group. The following year, they released \\"I'll Let You Know\\" on the Chess Records label subsidiary Checkmate. The record did not go anywhere and two follow-up records where they changed their name to The Vels including \\"Camel Walk\\" and \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\" also failed to bring any national interest to the group. The group later became Marvin Gaye's background singers on hit singles such as \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" and \\"Hitch Hike\\". After Martha recruited Roz, Gloria and Annette to back her on a demo record intended for Mary Wells titled \\"I Have to Let Him Go,\\" Motown president Berry Gordy offered Reeves, who was then holding a secretarial job for the label, a recording contract for herself and her background singing partners. Choosing the name Martha and the Vandellas, the group signed to Motown in September 1962 and issued what had been intended as a demo recording for their first single. Martha and the Vandellas Following a successful performance while performing at the Motortown Revue, the Vandellas scored a hit with their second single, \\"Come and Get These Memories\\". The song, one of the first major compositions by the team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, charted at the top ten of the American R&B; singles chart. Their second hit, \\"(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave\\", helped the group to distinguish themselves from the other girl groups in the label including the pop-oriented Marvelettes and the doo-wop-influenced Supremes with a rougher, brassier gospel-influenced sound. Reeves was a brassy alto while Annette was a deep contralto, and Rosalind was a high soprano. Like the Supremes' Florence Ballard, the Marvelettes' Wanda Rogers and The Four Tops' Abdul \\"Duke\\" Fakir, Ashford registered as the high background vocal in Vandellas records. After \\"Quicksand\\" gave the group a third top forty pop hit, Beard left to start a family with her new spouse. Reeves recruited a former member of The Velvelettes, Betty Kelly, to replace her. With Kelly, the group continued their success with signature songs \\"Dancing in the Street\\", \\"Nowhere to Run\\", \\"I'm Ready for Love\\", and \\"Jimmy Mack\\". Ashford remained in the group when Kelly was replaced by Martha's sister Lois Reeves in 1967, but finally left in 1969. She was replaced by yet another Velvelette, Sandra Tilley. Ashford married (last name, Holmes) and began a career with the local Detroit telephone company. In the mid-1980s, she reunited with Martha and fellow original Vandella Annette Helton for a UK tour and recordings on Ian Levine's \\"Motor City Records.\\" In 2005, the three performed in Atlantic City at the Vocal Group Hall of Fame induction ceremonies and a week later in the Baltimore/Washington area. Now retired, Ashford-Holmes and Helton periodically perform as \\"The Original Vandellas,\\" Later years In 1978, Rosalind was convinced to join Martha and Annette in a reunion performance while performing for a benefit concert for actor Will Geer. Eleven years later, the three original Vandellas recorded the single, \\"Step Into My Shoes\\" for the London- based Motorcity Records label. Since then, she and Annette have continued to perform often billing themselves as The Original Vandellas sometimes reuniting with Martha for benefit concerts. In 1995, she was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as member of Martha and the Vandellas.

A strikingly unusual aircraft, the PL-11 Airtruck was developed from the Kingsford Smith PL.7 as a replacement for the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the New Zealand aerial topdressing market by Luigi Pellarini for Waitomo Aircraft. The prototype was constructed using bits of war surplus ex-RNZAF North American Harvards. It featured all aluminium structure, a high-wing monoplane with a steel stub wing and V lift struts, steerable tricycle undercarriage, an extremely stubby pod fuselage, the cockpit (made from shortened Harvard glazing) being mounted directly over the radial engine, providing excellent forward view and very high drag, beneath it was room for a superphosphate hopper or up to 5 people in a cabin. The strangeness was completed by twin booms each supporting unconnected tail units, (the idea being a truck could reverse between the tail units to load the hopper). Despite the outlandish appearance the Airtruck was surprisingly successful, if unable to compete with the Fletcher Fu24 in its design market. The first Bennett Airtruck, ZK-BPV, took to the air on 2 August 1960,Taylor 1965, p.111. and crashed during trials in October 1963. Following company reorganization the second example, known as the Waitomo PL-11 Airtruck and registered ZK-CKE, flew in March 1965. It commenced commercial operations late in February 1967 but crashed a few days later. An unconfirmed report indicates that a third airframe was largely constructed but never flew. A shortage of Harvard parts led to the type being redesigned for all-new construction by the Transavia Corporation, as the Transavia PL-12 Airtruk, 118 of which were produced in Australia between 1965 and 1985.

The cleric is primarily a healer, but is also very capable when fighting after choosing domains like Zeal or War. They are usually a priest and a holy warrior, and were originally modeled on or inspired by the Military Orders. Clerics are usually members of religious orders, and were originally intended to portray soldiers of sacred orders who have magical abilities, although this role was later taken more clearly by the paladin. Most clerics have powers to heal wounds, protect their allies, and sometimes resurrect the dead. Some are able to summon, manipulate and banish undead. A description of Priests and Priestesses from the NetHack guidebook: Priests and Priestesses are clerics militant, crusaders advancing the cause of righteousness with arms, armor, and arts thaumaturgic. Their ability to commune with deities via prayer occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in it.http://www.nethack.org/v343/Guidebook.html#_TOCentry_2 Nethack Guidebook, entry 2 with character classes. A common feature of clerics across many games is that they may not equip pointed weapons such as swords or daggers, and must use blunt weapons such as maces, war-hammers, shields or wand instead. This is based on a popular, but erroneous, interpretation of the depiction of Odo of Bayeux and accompanying text. They are also often limited in what types of armor they can wear, though usually not as restricted as mages. Related to the cleric is the paladin, who is typically a Lawful Good warrior often aligned with a religious order, and who uses their martial skills to advance its holy cause. Dungeons & Dragons In the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, the cleric is one of the four base character classes. Clerics are versatile figures, both capable in combat and skilled in the use of divine magic, which they employ without any restriction despite encumbrance of their armour. In earlier versions of the games they were restricted to using bludgeoning weapons, such as maces, staffs, and war- hammers. In later additions this limit was lifted depending on the symbolic weapon of their deity, although other martial (non-simple) weapons were still alien to them - requiring a costly feat in the latest edition of the game to employ them. Clerics are powerful healers due to the large number of healing and curative spells available to them. With divinely-granted abilities over life or death, they are also able to repel, destroy, rebuke, or control undead creatures - depending upon whether they are good or evil. Video games Clerics are a common character option across many computer RPGs, which share their heritage with the tabletop roleplaying games that originated the class. Although some games hew closely to that older archetype, there exist many variations in the conception, background and abilities of the cleric class. * Vanguard: Saga of Heroes has the Cleric class as one of the four specialized healer classes, in a form comparable with D&D; (heavy armor, low damage output, some anti-undead abilities). * In EverQuest II, \\"Cleric\\" refers to both Inquisitors and Templars, which are evil and good (respectively) variants on the traditional Clerical roles. * In Lineage II, human mages may choose Cleric at their first class change. Elven Clerics exist as well, but are called \\"Elder\\" instead. * In Fire Emblem, the Clerics, sometimes known as \\"Sisters,\\" are all women (their male equivalent being the Monk or Priest), later promoted to the Bishop class. * In ROSE Online the Clerics can prevent monsters from talking by making them no longer believe in their souls. * In Aion: Tower of Eternity, The Cleric is a Daeva who follows the Star of Healing. It uses magic power to strengthen the body and to heal injuries. It can also restore life by using a revival spell when a Daeva's soul and body are separated. * In Dragon Nest, The Cleric is one of the five classes that a player may choose at the start of the game. The Cleric's role in the game is mainly to support its party, as it possesses skills that heal and buff team mates. Their role further branches out to Paladins and Priests, available as secondary classes at level 15. They are welcomed in most parties that are about to go into difficult dungeons and nests (Paladins for tanking and drawing aggro/Priests for healing and buffing team mates). The downside is their limited mobility compared to other classes. Also, a full-support build (which makes the class a popular must-have in a party) usually results in dull gameplay because sacrifices must be made to the offensive skills in order to have high support abilities. Lastly, Clerics must be well geared in order to accomplish good support. In Dragon Nest, Clerics are shown as rivals of the Sorceress class which can be seen time to time in the main storyline. The Cleric is a male character and is not available in the female version. * In Happy Wars the Cleric is a character class that heals, resurrects allies, summons materials and can take away enemy enchantments. * In Dragomon Hunter the Cleric is a character class that heals allies with magic and has offensive skills that are dolled out via a hammer or cestus. * In the Dark Souls series, the Cleric is a character class that can be chosen at the start of every installment. Traditionally, the class is described as a; \\"Cleric on Pilgrimage. Wields a mace and casts healing miracles.\\"  In wargaming  Clerics are also seen in fantasy wargaming. In those games they are usually thought of as the archetype of strong warriors with blunt weapons. Examples are below. * In Hordes of the Things Clerics are a type of unit, they are considered magic users and cost more points than Mages, suggesting the Cleric's superiority.

Early life and education Born in Hamilton County, Ohio, he moved with his parents to Bourbon County, Kentucky the same year.The 1850 United States Census, Fountain County, Covington, p. 133, he is listed as having been born in Kentucky. He attended the public schools, studied law at Transylvania University, taught school, and worked as a farm hand. Hannegan moved to Fountain County, Indiana about 1825 where he worked as a farm hand and as a school teacher. He was admitted to the bar in April 1828 in Fountain County. Moving the following year, he was admitted to practice law in Warren County, Indiana on May 27, 1829, settling in Williamsport. A few months later, he moved to Covington, where he continued the practice of law.Whicker, p. 368 At some unknown time, Hannegan became a Freemason.See, The Political Graveyard On April 4, 1829, he married Margaret Chambers Duncan in Knox County, Indiana;County Court Records at Vincennes, Indiana they had one son, Sellman Key Hannegan, born January 20, 1832.U.S. Passport application of Sellman K. Hannegan, August 30, 1871. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Washington D.C.; Passport Applications, 1795‚Äì1905; Microfilm Serial: M1372;Roll #176. Politics and foreign service Hannegan was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives 1832‚Äì1833 and 1841‚Äì1842. He was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1833 ‚Äì March 4, 1837. Hannegan was not a candidate for renomination in 1836 and resumed the practice of law; he was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1842 and served from March 4, 1843 to March 4, 1849. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1849, losing to Governor James Whitcomb. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims (Twenty-ninth Congress) and a member of the Committee on Roads and Canals (Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Congresses) and the Committee on Foreign Relations (Thirtieth Congress). He was appointed by President James K. Polk United States Minister to Prussia March 29, 1849 and served 1849‚Äì1850. The Queen consort of King Frederick William IV became infatuated with Hannegan. During a court function, Hannegan broke custom and kissed the hand of the queen. Irate and possibly jealous, King Frederick Wilhelm IV requested that Hannegan be recalled.Whicker, p. 370 Upon his return to the United States, Hannegan resumed his law practice in Covington. Military service On August 5, 1838, Hannegan received a commission as a colonel in the Indiana militia.Whicker, p. 368-369 He was stationed at Fort Plymouth due to conflict with the local Potawatomi who were being forced to leave Indiana for Osawatomie in the Kansas Territory. This event became known as the Trail of Death because more than 40 of the 850 tribal members died on the march. Murder case Hannegan was an alcoholic from a young age. On the night of May 6, 1852 his brother-in-law, Captain John R. Duncan, who had served honorably in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and with whom he and his wife lived, confronted Hannegan about his heavy drinking out of concern for Hannegan's political future. Hannegan's wife took him by the arm and attempted to take him upstairs away from the argument. Hannegan grabbed a nearby cane dagger and mortally wounded Duncan by stabbing him in the neck to the hilt of the dagger.Whicker, p. 371. The cane remained in the family of the Covington sheriff who arrested Hannegan until 1947, when it was donated to the Indiana State Museum. The cane is presently on display there in an exhibit titled \\"Odd Indiana\\", September 4, 2010 ‚Äì February 12, 2012. Duncan died the following day, declaring that no blame should be placed on Hannegan.Whicker, p. 371 Hannegan was arrested and charged with manslaughter. At the time, Lew Wallace was the prosecuting attorney for Covington; he was also a close friend of Hannegan. Because Wallace's prosecution was so weak and Hannegan was permitted to present his case (an unusual practice), the grand jury refused to indict Hannegan. Wallace was heavily criticized by the community for his prosecution and forced to resign and move to Crawfordsville. Daniel W. Voorhees was then appointed to replace Wallace. Despite the evidence, Voorhees decided not present the case to the grand jury, and he too was forced to leave Covington. The case was dismissed by Judge Isaac Naylor, September 18, 1852. Later life and death Hannegan continued to practice law in Covington until 1857 when he moved to St. Louis, Missouri where his son was already living. He practiced law there for two years and was preparing to reenter politics. Hannegan's wife preceded him in death and he continued drinking and developed a morphine habit. He was the keynote speaker at a political rally on February 24, 1859 promoting the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas for president. Hannegan was intoxicated and under the influence of morphine when he delivered the address, which was poorly received.Whicker, p. 373 Derided and ridiculed for his performance, Hannegan returned to his room where he overdosed on morphine, his body being discovered the following day.The St. Louis Registry of Deaths for the week ending March 5, 1859 notes Hannegan's death on p. 39. Place of birth is noted as Kentucky; place of death is noted as Fifth Street. His cause of death is noted as arterial congestion. Interment was in Woodlawn Cemetery, Terre Haute, Indiana.

The historic U.S. Route 66 (US 66, Route 66) ran east‚Äìwest across the central part of the state of New Mexico, along the path now taken by Interstate 40 (I-40). However, until 1937, it took a longer route via Los Lunas, Albuquerque, and Santa Fe, now roughly New Mexico State Road 6 (NM 6), I-25, and US 84\\\\. Large portions of the old road parallel to I-40 have been designated NM 117, NM 118, NM 122, NM 124, NM 333, three separate loops of I-40 Business, and state-maintained frontage roads. It is one of the roads on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways. History Route 66 in New Mexico was marked over portions of two auto trails ‚Äî the National Old Trails Road from Arizona via Albuquerque and Santa Fe to just shy of Las Vegas, and one of the main routes of the Ozark Trails network from that point into Texas. The state had taken over maintenance of these roads under several numbers: NM 6 from Arizona to Los Lunas, part of NM 1 through Albuquerque and Santa Fe to near Las Vegas, NM 56 to Santa Rosa, the short NM 104 to Cuervo, and part of NM 3 to Texas. While NM 56 and NM 104 were completely absorbed by US 66, NM 6 was reassigned to a route splitting from US 66 (old NM 6) at Laguna and heading straight east through Albuquerque, Moriarty, and Palma to US 66 at Santa Rosa. Except between Albuquerque and Moriarty, where it formed part of US 470, this was an unimproved road. New Mexico had long been controlled politically by the Santa Fe Ring, a group of businesspeople and officials with close ties to the Republican Party. In 1924, Democrat Arthur Thomas Hannett was unexpectedly elected for a single term (1925‚Äì1927) as governor, only to be defeated with various dirty tricks in the next election. Blaming the Republican establishment in Santa Fe for his defeat, Hannett used the lame duck remainder of his term to force through a sixty-nine mile cutoff from Santa Rosa directly to Albuquerque, bypassing Santa Fe entirely. The hastily constructed new road opened January 3, 1927, while incoming governor Richard Dillon was still trying to get construction stopped. Dillon was replaced by Arthur Seligman, a Democrat, in 1931. This new NM 6 was approved as a future realignment of Route 66 by 1932, and in 1933, a new bridge over the Rio Puerco opened. Once paving was completed in 1937, with AASHO approval given on September 26, 1937, Route 66 was moved to this shorter route, known as the Laguna Cut-off west of Albuquerque and the Santa Rosa Cut-off east of Albuquerque. The bypassed roads became NM 6 once again to the west and part of US 84 to the east. Route description From the Arizona state line to the Grants area the landscape is mountainous, and US 66 meanders around I-40. It also passes through some Indian reservations. At Laguna, New Mexico is the Laguna Indian Pueblo. At Mesita, the highway originally followed what is now NM 6 to east of I-25 at Los Lunas. It passed through Albuquerque from south to north along Fourth Street, part of the historic El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (El Camino Real). The highway is now replaced with I-25 through Santa Fe to, almost, Las Vegas (Historic 66 turns south before reaching Las Vegas), though several old sections exist which are barely (if at all) driveable. From south of Las Vegas back to I-40, the road has been replaced with US 84. The later, and more popular, alignment, continued straight west to Albuquerque, becoming Central Avenue through the city. While the former US 66 through Albuquerque is now owned and maintained by the city of Albuquerque, a few US-66/BUSINESS I-40 signs remain along Central Avenue in the downtown area. East of Albuquerque, US 66 is now NM 333 all the way to Moriarty. A stretch of NM 333 in Tijeras is a musical road, with rumble strips that play \\"America the Beautiful\\". I-40 east of Moriarty to Santa Rosa was built by adding a second set of lanes to US 66\\\\. East of Santa Rosa, US 66 is now largely frontage roads for I-40 or business loops for Santa Rosa and Tucumcari. At San Jon, the original alignment (now gravel) continues to the Texas state line at the historic ghost town of Glenrio. A later alignment is the north frontage road for I-40. Major intersections This route is based on the later alignment via Central Avenue in Albuquerque, bypassing both Santa Fe and Los Lunas. Much of this road was upgraded in place as I-40 or used as frontage road or business loops. Structures Madonna of the Trail, Albuquerque The New Mexico Madonna of the Trail is one of a dozen monuments (one in each state on the National Old Trails Road) commemorating the hardships of early pioneer travellers. She stands on US 66 in Albuquerque. Albuquerque is also home to the 1927 Art Deco themed KiMo Theater and the first modern suburban shopping mall in New Mexico, Nob Hill. =Historic districts= Fort Wingate, an abandoned military installation east of Gallup, traces its history to attempts in the 19th century to forcibly displace Navajo to native reservations. It later served as a line of defence against the Apache. Closed in 1912, it reopened briefly to house prisoners during both world wars. The Barelas-South Fourth Street Historic District is a collection of commercial buildings from various eras in a formerly Hispanic residential neighbourhood in Albuquerque. Eras represented include the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the later construction of US 66. The Park Lake Historic District is a 25-acre municipal park on a lake in Santa Rosa. Constructed under the Works Progress Administration between 1934 and 1940, the park was a make-work project during the Great Depression. =Restaurants= The historic Jones Motor Company building in Albuquerque, originally a motorcar dealership, has been re- purposed to house the local Kelly's Brew Pub. =Service and filling stations= Richardson's Store in Montoya, a 1901 railroad town, initially provided provisions for Rock Island Railroad workers and ranchers. When Route 66 came to town, the store carried groceries and auto supplies. It closed after I-40 bypassed the community. Roy T. Herman's Garage and Service Station in Thoreau was moved in 1937 from Grants, where it had originally been established in 1935. The routing of Route 66 had moved, so the station moved with it to keep its Route 66 clientele. =Trading posts= New Mexico is home to the Native American Pueblo of Santo Domingo (Kewa Pueblo) in Santo Domingo and the Pueblo of Laguna in Laguna. Roadside merchants on Route 66 often based their stores on the design of the early trading posts which originally served the native community. Bowlin's Old Crater Trading Post, Bluewater has long been closed and vacant. Originally a native trading post, its proprietors established a modern chain of highway service centres. Albuquerque's 1939 Maisel's Indian Trading Post, which once employed hundreds of native craftspeople, was reopened in the 1980s and remains in operation today. =Camps, motor courts, and motels= Neon signage illuminating the Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari Various towns and cities quickly established roadside motel strips to accommodate a burgeoning traffic from Route 66 travellers. Tucumcari had long advertised \\"2000 motel rooms\\" (later \\"1200 motel rooms\\") on roadside signage for hundreds of miles along US 66 using the slogan \\"Tucumcari tonite!\\" At least one historically restored Tucumcari Boulevard motel, the 12-room, neon-lit, 1939 Blue Swallow Motel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another motel recently restored nearby is the Motel Safari. The Motel Safari was built in 1959 by Chester Dohrer and features a mid-century modern retro design with \\"Doo Wop\\" or \\"Googie\\" styled architecture. Boomerangs, holes in cinder blocks, counter stacked bricks protruding from the fa√ßade and whimsical metal cylinders that light up at night, along with its famous camel atop the neon sign, paying tribute to the U.S. Camel Corps that once came through the area in the 1800s on a surveying expedition for a future national road system. Central Avenue in Albuquerque has many motels from this era, although some (such as the Aztec Motel) have been demolished. Historic Albuquerque lodgings from Route 66's heyday include the Luna Lodge, Tewa Motor Lodge, De Anza Motor Lodge and El Vado Auto Court. Some of these motels are currently closed but are the target of local efforts to ensure their historic preservation. The El Rancho Hotel in Gallup has been the temporary home of many movie stars. =Bridges and road segments= The Rio Puerco Bridge, a Parker Through truss bridge crossing the Rio Puerco, was built in 1933. Eleven New Mexico road segments on US 66 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; some originally incorporated wooden bridges to carry the road through flood plains. Listed road segments include: Glenrio to San Jon; San Jon to Tucumcari; Palomas to Montoya; Montoya to Cuervo; Cuervo to NM 156; Albuquerque to Rio Puerco; Laguna to McCartys; McCartys to Grants; Milan to Continental Divide; Iyanbito to Rehobeth; and Manuelito to the Arizona border.

Its most notable members include DJ Screw, Big Hawk, Big Mello, Big Moe, Big Pokey, the Botany Boyz, E.S.G., Fat Pat, Lil' Flip, Lil' Keke, Lil' O, Trae and Z-Ro. In addition, Devin the Dude, K-Rino, Lil' Troy, South Park Mexican and UGK are considered to be \\"Screwed Up Affiliated\\". Many of the current and former SUC members come from the neighborhoods of South Park, 3rd Ward, Sunnyside, Cloverland, Hiram Clarke and South Acres. History In the early 1990s, a new type of music began gaining popularity in Houston, collectively called \\"Chopped and screwed\\", which was pioneered by DJ Screw. The sound was created from a turntable technique in which Screw slowed down the tempo and torqued with parts of hip-hop anthems, giving them a new sound which he believed made the lyrics easier to understand. In 1993, he began to release tapes, known as \\"Screw Tapes\\", on which he slowed down and manipulated records by popular artists and also prominently included freestyles by a group of friends and local rappers, who came to be known as the Screwed Up Click. In 1994, Screw moved into a house in the eastern park of South Park, which soon came to be known as \\"The Screw House\\", where he could conduct his new business of selling tapes and recording freestyles with the group. These tapes quickly gained popularity in the area, allowing many of the group's members to launch successful solo careers. At some point the business became too much for the house, so the group relocated its operations to a store in Missouri City that became known as \\"The Screw Shop\\". After years of success that took its members to new heights, the S.U.C. found itself surrounded by tragedy when two of its members died, Fat Pat who was murdered and DJ Screw who overdosed from a lethal combination of codeine and other drugs. However, the group still continues to record new music with many of its members now focusing primarily on their solo careers. In later years, the group saw the deaths of other members including Big Hawk and Big Moe in 2006 and 2007 respectively, as well as the incarceration of others. More recently in 2010, the S.U.C. had a reunion tour in 2010 which included Big Pokey, Lil' Keke, Lil' O and Z-Ro.

Beyer High School is a high school in Modesto, California, located in the Stanislaus County. Facilities Although when it was opened in 1972 to an enrollment of 975 students, mostly freshmen and only a smattering of upperclassmen who transferred from other schools voluntarily, Beyer was originally designed to serve approximately 2000 students. By the time the first class of freshman had advanced to seniority, enrollment was about 1800. With the addition of numerous portable buildings, the number of enrolled students was as high as 3150, but since Enochs High School opened enrollment has returned to 1800. When built, Beyer was on the outskirts of the city, halfway between Riverbank and Modesto. In anticipation of the 1976 United States Bicentennial, the Patriots were chosen as the school's mascot, and the school colors chosen as red, white, and blue. Beyer High was intended to incorporate the latest advances in the science of education, the most prominent of which was Daily Demand Scheduling (DDS). The DDS or Modular Scheduling as it was called was a dismal failure. It gave all students the ability to chose any classes they wanted take each day. There was very little supervision to make sure students met graduation requirements. Hence many did not have the necessary credits at graduation, eventually the school districts realized it's and their shortcomings and scrapped the program. DDS was terminated in 1981-82 school year by a decision of the Modesto City School Board of Trustees, over the objections of administrators, staff, students, and parents.

Completed in early 1928, it was the largest basketball arena in the United States until 1950. The facility was renamed Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1966 in honor of Butler's longtime coach and athletic director, Paul D. \\"Tony\\" Hinkle. It is the sixth-oldest college basketball arena still in use, as well as the oldest and among the largest basketball arenas in NCAA's Division I basketball, although its initial seating capacity of more than 15,000 has been reduced to 9,100. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987, Hinkle Fieldhouse is sometimes referred to as \\"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral.\\" Hinkle Fieldhouse has served as the home court for the Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team since 1928 (with the exception of 1943 to 1945, when it was converted to a military barracks during World War II) and as the site of the annual Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournament's championship games from 1928 to 1971. In addition to amateur and professional basketball games, it has hosted visits from U.S. presidents, indoor track events and bicycle races, professional tennis matches, circuses, and other civic and religious gatherings. The Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team won the Horizon League conference title at Hinkle in 2010. Several memorable high school basketball championship games were played at the Butler arena, including the 1954 title game, when tiny Milan High School s basketball team defeated a larger Muncie Central High School team. Milan's team served as the inspiration for the movie Hoosiers (1986), and the final scenes of the film's championship game were filmed at Hinkle Fieldhouse. Another notable event occurred in 1955 and 1956 when Indianapolis's Crispus Attucks High School won back-to-back state high school championships, a first for an all-black high school team. History Hinkle Fieldhouse (originally named Butler Fieldhouse) was among the first buildings erected when Butler University moved to the Fairview campus in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1928.\\"Butler University\\" in Butler Fieldhouse and the Butler Bowl (a 36,000-seat football stadium that has since been downsized and renamed the Bud and Jackie Sellick Bowl) were promoted by a corporation of 41 Indianapolis businessmen who viewed them as a benefit to the city as well as Butler. When Butler signed a lease with the Indiana High School Athletic Association to host the champtionship games of the state's high school basketball tournament, the corporation agreed to finance the construction project at a cost of $1 million. Designed by Indianapolis architect Fermor Spencer Cannon, construction began on the basketball arena at 49th Street and Boulevard Place on the northeast edge of Butler's campus in fall of 1927. When completed in early 1928, it was the largest basketball arena in the United States, a distinction it retained until 1950, and is the sixth-oldest college basketball arena still in use. and See also: Note: This includes Also: And accompanying photographs.\\"Hinkle Fieldhouse\\" in Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 682. Called Butler Fieldhouse from 1928 to 1966, it was renamed Hinkle Fieldhouse in honor of Butler's longtime coach and athletic director, Paul D. \\"Tony\\" Hinkle. The arena's design included a steel truss system that provides spectators with unobstructed views of the basketball court, an initial seating capacity of more than 15,000, and a fireproof brick and stone exterior. The innovative technology for its time served as the inspiration for other basketball arenas. Hinkle Fieldhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 22, 1983, and designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987, and has been in use for nine decades. Although Hinkle Fieldhouse has hosted other events, it is best known as a basketball venue in a state that is well known for its enthusiasm for the game (often referred to as \\"Hoosier Hysteria\\"). In addition to serving as the home court for the Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team, Butler hosted the Indiana high school tournament's championship games from 1928 to 1971 (except for 1943 to 1945, when the arena was converted to a military barracks to house U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy recruits during World War II.Jones, p. 16. The state high school championship games returned to the Butler Fieldhouse in 1946 and remained there until 1972, when the Indiana High School Athletic Association moved the state basketball tournament's championship games to Indiana University's Assembly Hall in Bloomington, and later to other venues in the state. In November 1965, Butler University's board of trustees voted in favor of renaming the basketball facility Hinkle Fieldhouse to honor Paul D. \\"Tony\\" Hinkle, a former three-sport coach and athletic director at Butler. Hinkle, who came to Butler as an assistant basketball coach in 1921, was named its head basketball coach in 1926. Hinkle served as head coach of the Butler men's basketball, baseball, and football teams from 1934 to 1970. He was also Butler's athletic director.Jones, pp. 17 and 19. On December 22, 1983, Hinkle Fieldhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987, in recognition of its role in transforming college basketball into a popular spectator sport in the 1920s and 1930s. Hinkle Fieldhouse is one of only a few early 20th- century sports arenas still in use in the United States, and among the best- preserved of its kind. Brad Stevens, the former Butler basketball coach who became head coach of Boston Celtics, once remarked that Hinkle Fieldhouse is \\"not for everybody,\\" but continued, \\"But it is for somebody that appreciates tradition, somebody that appreciates history.\\" In 2006, to celebrate Butler University's 150th anniversary, a documentary about Hinkle Fieldhouse entitled Indiana's Basketball Cathedral aired on ESPN. More recently, a $36.2 million renovation and restoration project was completed in 2014. The 2015‚Äì2016 basketball season the first full season in the upgraded facility. The Butler Bulldogs continue to play on the oldest and one of the largest facilities in NCAA Division I basketball. Building description The exterior of the historic arena has the appearance of \\"a red-brick airplane hangar\\" and has been called \\"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral.\\" Designed by Indianapolis architect Fermor Spencer Cannon, a founding member of the Indiana Society of Architects, the six-story brick arena on more than had an original seating capacity of 15,000. The expansive, cathedral-like facilities were the result of an arched-steel truss system that supported the roof and provided unobstructed views of the basketball court. Butler's fieldhouse was also among the earliest of its kind to use ramps for access to upper-deck seats. Because of its innovative construction, Hinkle Fieldhouse has served as a prototype for other indoor athletic facilities, including the design of Bankers Life Fieldhouse, home to the city's NBA and WNBA teams, respectively the Indiana Pacers and Indiana Fever. =Exterior and plan= The rectangular plan for the arena lies on an east‚Äìwest axis with round-arch gable ends. Its steel truss system supports a three-stage monitor roof and red-brick walls resting on a poured concrete foundation. The three-story main facade (south wall) is constructed of brick on a concrete foundation. A stone belt course surrounds the structure between the first and second stories. Decorative buttresses vertically divide the main facade into twenty-two bays. There are eight entry gates on the south wall with tall, round-arch windows above the entry doors. The north wall is similar to main facade, but it does not have entry gates. The east facade has a round-arch gable about six stories tall, as well as nine bays divided by buttresses. The west facade is identical to east wall above third floor; however, a two-story brick wing is attached to the west wall at its lower levels. The arena's exterior still retain its original features, but the steel-framed windows and metal doors have been either repaired or replaced in subsequent renovations.Jones, p. 23. =Interior= The main interior feature of the arena is an NCAA regulation-sized basketball court at the center. The removable hardwood basketball court, which originally ran east‚Äìwest, was changed in 1933 to a north‚Äìsouth orientation to provide additional arena seating and to avoid the glare of late afternoon sun on the court. Three tiers of seating, which originally contained wooden plank bleachers, surround the basketball court on all sides. (Most of these bleachers were replaced with seat back chairs during a renovation in 2014.) The interior also has poured concrete floors and ramps, which lead to the two upper tiers of stands, and an open concourse surrounding the stands. In addition, the interior framework has exposed steel girders and corrugated metal roof sheathing. Interior walls are brown glazed brick. Ticket offices are located at the entryway. Concrete block offices and classrooms initially built under the main floor stands were removed during renovations in 2014. Natural light streams in from the monitor roof and gable-end windows. The facility also has electric lighting. =Wing= The fieldhouse's two-story brick wing has a flat roof and is attached to the arena's west wall at the lower levels. The wing's main floor originally contained a swimming pool and a small gymnasium; lockers and mechanical rooms were in the area below ground. The wing had fallen into disuse and was completely remodeled as part of major renovations completed in 2014. = Renovations = The basketball arena has been renovated and remodeled several times over its 90-year history. In 1933, for example, the interior was reconfigured, to change the court from an east‚Äìwest to a north‚Äìsouth orientation. In the initial arrangement, more than half of the seats were at the ends of the court, while event viewing is typically better from the sides. A major $1.5 million facelift in 1989 reduced the original seating capacity of 15,000 to 11,043. The main reception area, basketball offices, film rooms, and team locker rooms were also renovated. In 1992, other athletic and physical education offices, sports locker rooms, and fitness facilities at the fieldhouse were renovated as well. Butler University began planning in 2009 for another major renovation to the exterior and interior of the facility. The $36.2 million renovation and restoration project was completed in 2014. RATIO Architects worked with university officials to maintain appearance of the historic exterior, improve the interior's accessibility, and renovate the building's wing. To assist with renovation costs, the university was the recipient of a $750,000 federal Save America's Treasures grant. In 2015, Indiana Landmarks awarded Butler its Cook Cup for Outstanding Renovation. Because of the building's National Historic Landmark status, exterior changes to the fieldhouse are minimal. Renovations made in 2014 included the replacement of steel-sash windows and 9,700 windowpanes, in addition to tuckpointing 282,000 exterior bricks. Interior renovations made in 2014 included removal of offices and storage space under the bleachers to open up the main concourses, adding decorative murals and new scoreboards, upgrading seating to improve accessibility and comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and additional mechanical upgrades such as air conditioning. The appearance of the basketball court, barrel-vaulted ceiling, and the exposed-steel roof trusses are mostly unchanged. As part of the 2014 renovations, the arena's seating capacity was reduced from 10,000 to 9,100. The gym, which was originally filled with bleachers, was altered to include about 4,500 chair-back seats (covering nearly all of the lower two levels) and handrails along the aisles; however, some bleachers remain for student seating. In addition, a large video board was installed above midcourt and smaller scoreboards occupy each of the four corners. \\"The scoreboards on the side are new, but it still has a historic feel,\\" remarked Butler senior guard Alex Barlow in an interview in 2014. \\"It still has a lot of modern upgrades that fans like to see. If you see the locker room and the weight room and the training room, it's come a long way since I've gotten here.\\" New spaces were created during the renovation to the attached wing at the west end of Hinkle Fieldhouse by adding two floors to a former swimming pool area closed in 2002 due to the high maintenance costs. The result was a three-level facility that includes a training facilities, locker rooms, and an academic center with study spaces in an area the athletic department had been using for storage. In addition, an elevator was installed to reach upper decks of the fieldhouse. Butler's athletic administrative offices and coaches' offices are on the top level. The training facility on the second floor is reportedly six times larger than the previous training area. The men's and women's basketball offices are adjacent to their respective locker rooms on the lower level near the court have been upgraded. The men's basketball locker room has been expanded and, for the first time, has a separate video room. Gordon Hayward, a former Butler star who went on to become a professional player with the Utah Jazz in 2010 and Boston Celtics player in 2017, donated the funds for the locker-room renovation. Also: Events Hinkle Fieldhouse has hosted annual championship games of Indiana's high school basketball tournament, numerous collegiate games and tournaments, U.S. Olympic team exhibition games, and professional basketball games, as well as other special events. During World War II, the fieldhouse was temporarily converted to a military barracks. =Notable Butler team events= The Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team, who were named the national champions in 1928, won the inaugural game at Butler Fieldhouse on March 7, 1928, beating the University of Notre Dame, the defending national champion, with a final score of 21‚Äì13 in overtime with 12,000 fans in attendance.Jones, p. 19. Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted the entire 1994 Horizon League men's basketball conference tournament as well as parts of the 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010 Horizon League tournaments. Butler's men's basketball team won the Horizon League conference title at Hinkle in 2010. Butler's men's and women's basketball teams continue to play their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse as part of the Big East Conference. =Notable high school tournaments= In addition to hosting home games for the Butler basketball teams, Hinkle Fieldhouse was the site of Indiana's annual state high school boy's basketball championship games from 1928 to 1971. The only exception was 1943 to 1945, when the arena was used as a military barracks and the state's high school basketball championship games were held at the Coliseum on the grounds of the Indiana State Fair. In 1946, Indiana's high school basketball tournament games returned to Butler and remained there until 1972, when the championship games moved to Indiana University Bloomington's Assembly Hall, and from there to other venues. Afterwards, Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted sectional basketball games through 1993. The sectional games moved to Lawrence North High School in 1994. In the first high school boys' championship basketball game at Butler Fieldhouse in 1928, Muncie Central High School defeated Martinsville High School. (John Wooden, a member of the Martinsville team, went on to become a college basketball coach at Indiana State Teachers College (present-day Indiana State University) and beginning in 1948 at the University of California, Los Angeles.) In Butler Fieldhouse's first sellout crowd for the state tournament's championship game In March 1930, the Washington Hatchets defeated Muncie Central. At that time, Butler's basketball arena was \\"considered one of the premier places in the country to hold games.\\" Among the most memorable high school basketball games played at the Butler Fieldhouse occurred in the 1946 state championship game when Anderson High School's \\"Jumping Johnny\\" Wilson set a state finals record as the first player \\"to score 30 points in a title game.\\" Another notable game was the \\"Milan Miracle\\" in 1954, when tiny Milan High School's basketball team defeated the much larger Muncie Central High School team. Milan player Bobby Plump made the last-minute score to win the game and went on to become a star player at Butler. (The Milan team and the tournament win also served as the inspiration for the fictional Hickory High School team in the movie, Hoosiers (1986). The final scenes of the movie's championship game were also filmed at the fieldhouse.)Jones, p. 21. In 1950, Butler Fieldhouse was the site of the first televised broadcast of a state championship game. In the 1955 and 1956 state championship games at Butler Fieldhouse, Oscar Robertson and his teammates at Indianapolis's Crispus Attucks High School won back-to-back state championships, a first time for an all-black high school team. Crispus Attucks High School also used the Butler Fieldhouse as its home gym in the 1950s. =Other notable basketball games= Hinkle Fieldhouse has been host to other basketball-related events such as professional basketball teams, U.S. Olympic team exhibition games, and the first USSR-USA basketball game, as well as all- star basketball games for the NBA, ABA and the East-West College All-Stars. Several notable games took place at Butler Fieldhouse in the 1940s and 1950s. The 1940 NCAA Basketball Tournament East Regionals were held there, and won by the eventual national men's champion, the Indiana Hoosiers. Until 1978, those games were the only NCAA tournament games held in Indianapolis. In 1948 the annual Hoosier Classic basketball tournament with Indiana University, Purdue University, the University of Notre Dame, and Butler played its inaugural games at Butler Fieldhouse during the winter holidays. An estimated 75,000 fans watched these games in the first three years of the tournament. The NBA's Indianapolis Olympians, formed in 1949, used the Fieldhouse until the team disbanded and withdrew from the NBA after the 1952‚Äì53 season. In 1956, a few weeks before the U.S. Olympic team won a gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, Bill Russell and other U.S. Olympic team members played an exhibition game at Butler Fieldhouse against the Phillips 66ers, the national Amateur Athletic Union championship team.Jones, p. 22. In September 2019, the WNBA's Indiana Fever announced that they would use Hinkle Fieldhouse for all home games in 2020 and 2021, as well as part of the 2022 season. The move was made to accommodate a major renovation of Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The vast majority of work is scheduled to take place during the NBA offseason, which includes the entire WNBA season. See also: =Other events= In addition to basketball games, Hinkle Fieldhouse has been used for other athletic events such as professional tennis matches, six-day bicycle races, national equestrian events, and the Butler Relays (a national indoor track event in the 1930s and 1940s), among others.Jones, p. 16. Ten indoor world records for track events were set or tied at the Butler Relays, including Jesse Owens's world record of 6.1 seconds in the dash in 1935.‚ÄùButler Relays‚Äù in Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 371. Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted the Men's and Women's Volleyball Tournament during the 1987 Pan American Games, attracting 15,000 spectators. At that time, it was the highest-attended volleyball match ever held in the United States. In addition, Hinkle Fieldhouse has served as an \\"unofficial convention center\\" for politicians and religious leaders such as Wendell Willkie, Thomas E. Dewey, and Jesse Jackson; Evangelist Billy Graham; and host to U.S. presidents (Herbert Hoover, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton). Other special events have included three-ring circuses and a two- day, 125-piano concert. The final scene of the climactic championship game in Hoosiers (1986) was filmed at Hinkle Fieldhouse, the site of the 1954 championship game between Milan High School and Muncie Central. The Milan team and the final game were the inspiration for the fictional basketball team in the movie.) The film also featured the voices of the game's original announcers, Hilliard Gates and Tom Carnegie.

It is the largest sanctuary for strepsirrhine primates in the world. The center is open to the public through tours, for which visitors must make an appointment. History In 1966, a prosimian colony of approximately 90 individuals, belonging to John Buettner- Janusch, was relocated from the Center for Prosimian Biology at Yale University to Duke University, creating the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Through the 1970s, the colony grew to approximately 700 individuals representing 33 species. The current colony ranges between 250 and 300 animals, representing approximately 25 species. Originally called the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC), the center's name was changed in April 2006 after a refocusing of the scientific goals and overall mission. Specimens from its scientific collection may thus be assigned the code DPC. The mission of the Duke University Lemur Center is to \\"promote research and understanding of prosimians and their natural habitat as a means of advancing the frontiers of knowledge, to contribute to the educational development of future leaders in international scholarship and conservation and to enhance the human condition by stimulating intellectual growth and sustaining global biodiversity.\\" According to Duke University, the Lemur Center, the only university-based facility in the world devoted to the study of strepsirrhine primates, \\"is home to the world's largest colony of endangered primates ‚Äì including more than 200 lemurs, bush babies and lorises.... More than 85 percent of the center's inhabitants were born on site.\\" In 1997, the center began a program to reintroduce black-and- white ruffed lemurs into the Betampona Natural Reserve in Madagascar, the first return of any prosimian primates to the island nation. In 2009 and 2010, the center completed two new buildings for housing lemurs. The first building was completed in 2009 and is a facility (including exterior animal runs) with of interior space. It can house up to 60 animals that can be released into the Duke Forest if weather permits. The second building was completed in 2010 and is a facility (including exterior animal runs) with of interior space. Together, they are able to house 140 lemurs. The buildings are designed with animal housing wings radiating from a central core which houses common resources like laboratories, exam rooms, food prep, bathrooms, and storage spaces. Both buildings are designed for low water and electricity use, and are LEED registered. The total cost of the two-buildings, designed by architects Lord, Aeck & Sargent of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was $10.4 million. In 2013, a lemur briefly escaped from its habitat at the center. It was returned unharmed after five hours in Durham.  Zoboomafoo  The children's television show Zoboomafoo, produced by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), was filmed at the Duke Lemur Center. In order to film the show, a custom-made animal sound stage was constructed on the Duke University campus. One of the show's hosts Martin Kratt, holds a degree in Zoology from Duke University. On November 10, 2014, Jovian the Coquerel's sifaka (best known for mainly portraying Zoboomafoo in the series of the same name), he died of renal failure in his home at the Duke Lemur Center at the age of 20.

Born ( meaning spring or fountain, French: Born-sur-S√ªre, German: Born an der Sauer) is a village on the River Sauer in the commune of Mompach, in eastern Luxembourg. It lies on the N10, south of Echternach and north of Wasserbillig. Only 5 minutes drive from the E44 motorway from Luxembourg City to Trier, it is popular with tourists and day-trippers who walk, cycle or fish along the banks of the river. , Born has a population of 340. History Around 54 BC, the Romans overcame the Treveri, a Gallic tribe who had lived in the area for several hundred years. The Romans became firmly established in nearby Trier or Augusta Treverorum, a prosperous regional capital, but they also developed communities in the Moselle and Sauer valleys, especially at Wasserbillig (Biliacum), the bridge over the Sauer on the Roman road from Trier to Reims (Civitas Remorum), and Echternach, the bridge on the road from Arlon (Orolaunum), to Bitburg (Vicus Beda). Despite a number of attacks from the middle of the third century, the Romans maintained their influence in the area until about 450 when they were finally conquered by Germanic tribes. There is ample evidence of the Gallo-Roman civilization in the surroundings, not only the terraced orchards and vinyards but also Roman gravestones and monuments along the S√ªre valley. Roman ruins have also be found at Pafebierg, not far from Born. Born, Luxembourg - The Church It seems probable that the area where Born now lies later came under the rule of the Abbey of Echternach around the 8th century although it is not specifically mentioned until 1286.Commune de Mompach - Born Retrieved 16 November 2006. The parish church parish church Retrieved 17 November 2006. dates back to 1856 while Born Castle was built in the early 18th century although there are remains of much older buildings on the site and references dating back to the 13th century .Burgen und Schl√∂sser im Distrikt Grevenmacher Retrieved 20 November 2006. The castle was originally owned by the Lords of Born consisting of members of the Hattstein, Faust d'Aschaffenbourg and de Villiers families. The Prince Henri railway line from Echternach to Wasserbillig (via Born) was opened in 1874 and remained in service until 1963.Ligne de la S√ªre Retrieved 16 November 2006 The old track has now been converted into a cycle route. Geography and climate Born, altitude , is located between Rosport and Wasserbillig on the East bank of the River Sauer which forms the border between Luxembourg and Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate. Moersdorf is about south of Born, opposite the German village of Metzdorf. The steep hills on either side of the river reach a height of about and are used mainly for cattle grazing, orchards and forestry. Ch√¢teau de Born, Luxembourg In view of the NE-SW orientation of the river at Born, the community enjoys long periods of sunshine, unlike many of the villages along the Sauer which often lie in the shade of the hills. Summer temperatures average about but often reach and more. Rainfall is moderate. There is sometimes a little snow in the winter. Occasionally the River Sauer floods its banks, with the possibility of flooding in the village itself. Local services Born is served by the Wasserbillig-Echternach bus route with buses every half-hour. From Wasserbillig, there are trains to Luxembourg and Trier. Born has is a large camping site beside the river as well as two hotels and restaurants. There are several large supermarkets and stores in Wasserbillig () but there are also smaller shops in Rosport () and in the German village of Langsur () on the other side of the river.

The historic Route 66, the Mother Road or Main Street of America, took long distance automobile travelers from Chicago to Southern California. The highway had previously been Illinois Route 4 (IL 4) and the road has now been largely replaced with Interstate 55 (I-55). Parts of the road still carry traffic and six separate portions of the roadbed have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History A Route 66 mural on the Pontiac City Hall/Fire Station When US 66‚Äîfirst known as the Main Street of America and later dubbed the Mother Road by novelist John Steinbeck in 1939‚Äîwas designated on November 11, 1926, the original path used mostly pre-existing roads. That was intentional, to minimize any needed construction and to get the entire path of the route open to traffic as soon as possible. In fact, because Illinois had already paved most of the roads that would comprise US 66, Illinois was the first of the eight states through which the route ran to have its segment of US 66 completed at a time when much of Route 66 was still a gravel-and-dirt road. In Illinois and the Midwest in general, the construction of US 66 was important to the economies of small, rural towns, which saw a burst of activity when the road finally passed through. However, those communities in Illinois were already profiting from a paved highway that preceded Route 66 by a few years. In 1916, the Federal Aid Post Road Act, known as the Shackleford Bill, passed Congress and appropriated $75 million to be distributed to the states over the next five years. Funding was provided on an ongoing basis, over the period of five years, and the law made the federal government an active partner in road building for the first time. Five roads in Illinois were designated to receive federal money under the legislation; they were: the National Old Trails Road (National Road, present-day US 40), Lincoln Highway, Dixie Highway, the road from Chicago to Waukegan, and the road from Chicago to East St. Louis, including portions of IL 4, which was the actual predecessor to US 66 in Illinois. The earliest known Chicago-to-St. Louis road was a former Native American Indian trail and stagecoach road that was renamed the Pontiac Trail in 1915. Route 66 began in Chicago and, once outside the metropolitan Chicago area, traveled down the Pontiac Trail through many cities and towns on its way southwest, including Joliet, Odell, Bloomington, Lincoln, Springfield, Edwardsville and East St. Louis. IL 4 coincided with most of the Pontiac Trail and closely paralleled the Chicago and Alton Railroad tracks running from Chicago to East St. Louis. The roadbed for IL 4 was prepared in 1922 by teams of horses dragging equipment behind them. Laborers received 40 cents per hour for performing backbreaking labor on the roadbed. In 1923 in Bloomington- Normal, concrete was poured along the road's path along much the same route US 66 would take on its original route through the area. By 1924, IL 4 was almost entirely paved between Chicago and St. Louis. Construction on the few remaining parts of US 66 in Illinois began in 1926. By the 1930s, US 66 extended from Chicago through Springfield to St. Louis; much of the original pavement was still in use by the early 1940. The dangers of the original pavement were recognized by the nickname \\"Bloody 66,\\" which reflected the frequently deadly road accidents along the mostly rural route. When World War II erupted, Route 66‚Äîalready the heaviest trafficked highway in Illinois‚Äîsaw an increase in military traffic and importance to defense strategy. The aging road's deterioration was hastened by the increase in military truck traffic. The Defense Highway Act of 1941 provided Illinois with about $400,000 in funding, and by 1942, plans were in place to make much needed road repairs that were also intended in part to make the road safer for traffic. Route description =St. Louis to Hamel= The Chain of Rocks Bridge as it leaves St. Louis. The bridge bends at a 22¬∞ angle. In 1967, it was closed to automotive traffic. Entering Illinois from St. Louis, Missouri, the highway originally crossed the Mississippi River at the McKinley Bridge. This first alignment passed through Venice and Madison, eventually becoming IL 203 in northeast Granite City. In 1930, the Chain of Rocks Bridge was opened on Bypass US 66, allowing travelers to circumvent St. Louis. This route met the original Route 66 in Mitchell. The Luna Cafe, Bel-Air Drive-In sign, and the Old Greenway Motel can be found along this stretch of road, as well as The Mustang Corral, a Ford Mustang shop, just before IL 157 on the right hand side eastbound. Route 66 joined IL 157 through Hamel via Edwardsville. Congestion at the McKinley Bridge was reduced in 1951 with the construction of the Veterans' Memorial Bridge. Route 66 joined US 40, traversing East St. Louis and Fairmont City. Shortly after Fairmont City, Route 66 passed Cahokia Mounds, later a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It joined IL 157 on the western end of Collinsville, later navigating to modern day I-55 via IL 159\\\\. This stretch of Route 66 met the main route in Hamel. Poplar Street Bridge was opened in 1967 to facilitate I-55, I-64, and I-70. US 66 and US 40 were both simultaneously rerouted over this newer bridge instead of the Veterans' Memorial Bridge. =Hamel to Springfield= Original route IL 4 north of Auburn U.S. Route 66 originally followed IL 4 north of Hamel. This alignment navigated through Staunton, Sawyerville, Benld, Gillespie and Carlinville to Nilwood. The section of US 66/IL 4 from Nilwood to Girard was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 2002. Route 66 continues along IL 4 north through Virden, Thayer, to Auburn. A section of IL 4 north of Auburn and south of Springfield, which was also part of the original span of US 66, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 1998. This is the last brick alignment in Illinois. Route 66 then passed through Chatham, and entered Springfield. Breaking off of IL 4, the route passed the Illinois State Capitol and the Old State Capitol. Eastern alternate route The Soulsby Service Station in Mount Olive An alternate route northward from Hamel was opened in 1930. It followed IL 4 for , then branched off to the east, bypassing Staunton. The road moved northeast through Mount Olive past the Soulsby Service Station. The alignment from Litchfield to Mount Olive was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 29, 2001. This segment is a stretch that begins northwest of Mount Olive in southeastern Macoupin County and ends about north of the intersection of US 66 and IL 16 in Litchfield. This alignment passed through North Litchfield, South Litchfield, Cahokia and Mount Olive townships. The terrain through the area is mostly flat. Unlike other sections of Route 66 in Illinois that are listed on the National Register, the segment from Litchfield to Mount Olive does not include any contributing structures such as bridges or culverts. The Ariston Caf√© in Litchfield is the longest-operating restaurant along the former US 66\\\\. The Belvidere Caf√©, Motel, and Gas Station also provided services to travelers. This alternate alignment continued north past Waggoner, Farmersville, Divernon, Glenarm and joined the original path in Springfield near the Old Capitol Building. The increased military traffic along US 66 during World War II and the consequent extreme demands put on the road bed caused parts of the road to be replaced along this stretch during the 1940s. This stretch of US 66 became a four-lane road with two lanes in each direction; the new lanes became the southbound lanes. For south of Litchfield, the southbound lanes still carry two-way traffic. A new alignment of Route 66 headed northeast of Hamel through Livingston. This new section bypassed Mount Olive to the northeast, later running west of the old route through Litchfield before rejoining the original path. Sections of the older alternate route were destroyed during the 1930s when Lake Springfield was created; the fragments of the old route that remain were added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 12, 2009. =Springfield to Gardner= A stretch of the original roadbed of old U.S. Route 66 north of Cayuga From Springfield to Gardner, Historic US 66 is now a parallel frontage road for I-55, except for business loops for Lincoln and Bloomington-Normal. US 66 originally continued north through Springfield past the Illinois State Fairgrounds and the Lazy A Motel. The route rejoined IL 4 and continued alongside Carpenter Park; a small section of this route is listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 2002. Route 66 continued north through Sherman and Broadwell, entering Lincoln. From there, the route veered northeast through the towns of Lawndale, Atlanta, McLean, Funk's Grove, and Shirley. McLean is home to the famous Dixie Travel Plaza, a truck stop that was established as the Dixie Truckers Home in 1928. To the north is Funks Grove, settled by the Funk family in 1824 where pure \\"maple sirup\\"That spelling is particular to the area. is made. From there, Route 66 entered Bloomington, passing through the Central Business District and the McLean County Square. Further north as Bloomington gave way to Normal, the route passed Illinois State Normal University. From Normal, Route 66 continued northeast through Towanda, where there is now a parkway and bike trail along a stretch of the abandoned highway, with exhibits that highlight all eight states through which Route 66 travels. There are also classic \\"Burma Shave\\" signs displayed along the trail. Public library and tower clock on the town square in Atlanta Route 66 traveled through Lexington and Chenoa to Pontiac. Passing by the Illinois State Police Office, the route continued northeast through Cayuga and Odell to Dwight. A restored Standard Oil Gasoline Station still stands in Odell, as does Ambler's Texaco Gas Station in Dwight. The stretch from Cayuga to Chenoa was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 23, 2007. This section of US 66 was commissioned in 1926. The road segment travels from the northeast to the southwest and begins in the southeast corner of Odell Township in Livingston County and ends in the northwest corner of Chenoa Township in McLean County. US 66 passes through Odell, Esmen, Pontiac, Eppards Point, and Pike Townships, on its stretch from Cayuga to Chenoa. The road is paralleled on its east by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and on its west by I-55. Portions of the northbound and southbound lanes still carry traffic; in spots where one of the sections is still in use the other section is abandoned but still extant. An abandoned stretch of the Route 66 northbound lanes south of Pontiac; the southbound lanes still carry traffic. Along this stretch of highway, there are 14 structures and buildings. Insofar as the National Register and historic preservation are concerned, eight of those are considered contributing structures to the listing and six are considered non-contributing. There are also 12 highway bridges found along the segment and a box culvert; six of the bridges are considered contributing to the National Register listing, as is the box culvert. Six of the bridges have been replaced since the historic period, and all of the bridges are constructed from concrete. The bridges have various lengths and support structure. The box culvert along the segment of road measures by wide and was built as part of the road's foundation. This particular box culvert, like many, usually went unnoticed by travelers along the road. The section of pavement between Pontiac and Cayuga was part of a larger section of the roadway that began north of Cayuga in Gardner. This entire section was built in 1943 after large parts of Route 66 became badly deteriorated during the mid-1940s. The portion of the roadway that extended south of Pontiac to the newly constructed bypass at Bloomington-Normal was constructed during the early 1940s. =Gardner to Welco Corners= The route again split as it entered Gardner. These three alignments reunited at Welco Corners, which is located in present-day Bolingbrook. 1926 route through Joliet The original eastern path of US 66, most of which is currently designated as IL 53, served Gardner, Braceville, Godley, and Braidwood before entering Wilmington. The section of Route 66 from Wilmington to Joliet was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2006, and travels through mostly agricultural land, although the area also includes the former Joliet Arsenal. This segment of Route 66 runs through Joliet, Jackson, Wilmington and Florence Townships in Will County. It begins in Wilmington and ends just short of the I-80 interchange in Joliet. Several structures along this section are included in a National Register listing. Contributing structures to the listing include one bridge, one overpass and four concrete box culverts. The three-span, continuous steel multibeam bridge, in the northbound lanes, dates to 1950 and features concrete balusters and top rails. The box culverts were built as part of the 1926 road's foundation and range in width from . There are also four non-historic bridges constructed during the 1970s and 1980s along this stretch of US 66. Historic Route 66 & IL 53 in Joliet south of Theodore Street Currently, IL 53 coincides with Route 66 through Joliet. North of Joliet, the early roadbed was four lanes wide by 1936. It passed by the notorious Stateville Penitentiary, then in unincorporated Joliet but now in Crest Hill ever since that suburb was created. After IL 53 splits to the north in Romeoville, the road is signed only as Historic US 66\\\\. The later alignments rejoin this original path at Welco Corners, an early crossroads now part of Bolingbrook that by the 1920s had added a truck stop and other motorists' services. When this path was bypassed by the redirected US 66 in 1940, it became Alternate US 66, following Chicago Street through the central city on the east bank of the Des Plaines River and Broadway on the west bank. Decades later, even this business route split through the central city into northbound lanes on Scott Street and southbound lanes on Ottawa Street, with the split rejoining on Chicago at Columbia Street before crossing the Ruby Street Bridge to the west bank and onto Broadway, going north toward Crest Hill. All three of these north‚Äìsouth downtown streets offer a number of important historical structures for travelers to visit. The Rialto Square Theatre in Joliet on November 23, 2012 From south to north, these include the Beaux Arts style Joliet Union Station by Jarvis Hunt; the historic Church of St. Anthony, the oldest public building still in use in Joliet; the endangered St. Mary Carmelite Church by Patrick Keely; the Joliet Public Library, designed by Daniel Burnham; the restored Rialto Square Theatre, one of the few surviving movie palaces of the more than 400 designed by Rapp & Rapp; the Georgian Revival Louis Joliet Hotel, transformed into apartments but still an unfinished renovation project; the Neoclassical Old Joliet Post Office; the Auditorium Building block by G. Julian Barnes, a classic Joliet limestone building; the Joliet Area Historical Museum, which occupies another Julian Barnes building, the former Ottawa Street Methodist Church; the Italianate style Joliet Chamber of Commerce Clubhouse, now the JJC Renaissance Center, and the old Joliet YMCA across the street, both designed by Burnham Brothers; two Art Deco structures, the Public Service Building on Ottawa and the KSKJ Building on Chicago Street further north; and the magnificent Bedford limestone St. Joseph Church, designed by Burnham protege William J. Brinkmann and the largest church in the city, whose twin spires could be seen for miles around when Route 66 was new. There are also at least two pop-culture points of interest. One is just north of downtown Joliet, not far from the city center campus of Joliet Junior College. Sherb Noble opened the first Dairy Queen on June 22, 1940, at 501 N. Chicago Street in Joliet. Although the shop closed and the last soft serve ice cream was sold in the early 1950s, the building was designated a local landmark in November 2010. Across the river at the south end of Route 66 Park is the Rich & Creamy ice cream stand on Broadway, easily recognized by the statues of Elwood and Jake Blues, the Blues Brothers, posed on the roof. This classic stand is open for business from mid-spring through late fall, depending on the weather, and is a welcome stop on the tour. 1940 route through Plainfield The new western route was opened in 1940 and began in Gardner on the other (west) side of the Southern Pacific railroad tracks, taking over portions of IL 59 and IL 126. Its main purpose was to bypass Joliet. This route also served Braceville, Godley, and Braidwood but then curved north to Channahon, Shorewood, and Plainfield, rejoining the original route at Welco Corners. In Plainfield, this new route overlapped US 30 (Lincoln Highway) for a short distance. After this road was opened, the original route through Joliet was redesignated as Alternate US 66\\\\. Between Gardner and Braceville, a magnificent through-arch bridge carried this alignment of Route 66 over railroad tracks; unfortunately it deteriorated beyond repair and was demolished in 2000. Beyond Braidwood, motorists can follow this 1940 alignment on IL 129, I-55, IL 59, IL 126, and I-55 again. 1957 freeway route In 1957, a new freeway, which is today's I-55, was opened as US 66 between Gardner and Welco Corners, bypassing both Braidwood and Plainfield. Most portions of the 1940 western alignment that were not incorporated into the new freeway reverted to their previous state routes, except for the section from Gardner through Braidwood, which became IL 129. This freeway was originally designated only as US 66 and was then also designated as I-55 in 1960, becoming the first complete section of I-55 in Illinois. It served as mainline US 66 for 19 years, from 1957 to 1976, longer than either of the two previous alignments. Between 2007 and 2008, the section of I-55 between I-80 and Welco Corners, originally built as the redirected path of US 66 in 1957, was rebuilt and widened to three lanes in each direction to accommodate modern traffic loads. However, between I-80 and Gardner, I-55 today remains mostly as it was as US 66 in 1957. This heritage is evident, with fully mature trees in interchange medians, several 1957-era motels and gas stations still in operation, and several original bridges still in use, such as the Smith Bridge over the Des Plaines River and the nearby Blodgett Road overpass. =Welco Corners to Chicago= An aerial view of the Argonne National Lab campus in Argonne From Welco Corners in Bolingbrook to Indian Head Park, I-55 was built on top of much of old US 66\\\\. Here, Route 66 passed through what is now Woodridge, Darien, Willowbrook and Burr Ridge‚Äînone of which were in existence in 1926 when the route was created and did not come into existence as suburbs until the late 1950s through late 1960s. The stretch from Darien northeast through what is now Countryside and Hodgkins was then part of a large rural farmland collectively known as Lyonsville, as the eastern end of it was located in Lyons Township in Cook County. This section of mainline I-55 is today signed as Historic US 66, though inconsistently so, making it difficult for travelers to follow along the original 1926 path; however, a section of the original highway that now serves as the two-way north frontage road in Darien, Willowbrook and Burr Ridge retains the old Route 66 feel. The original path is slightly difficult to follow here, due to swings north around the I-55 interchanges between Lemont Road and County Line Road, but not impossible, and taking the north frontage road leads travelers past several sites of historic interest, including Cass Cemetery and the former Martin B. Madden mansion known as Castle Eden (now a Carmelite priory) in Darien as well as the International Harvester experimental fields in Burr Ridge (once known as Harvester, Illinois after the plant located there). Near the Cass Avenue instersection, Route 66 and I-55 pass by the northern edge of the Argonne National Laboratory campus. A mile or so further east near the IL 83 interchange, Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket in Willowbrook is still a popular stop for motorists on the route, although being cut off from the Interstate did cost it a significant amount of business after I-55 was built and during the 1960s through 1980s. At the Indian Head Park interchange with I-294 (Tri-State Tollway), I-55 separates from US 66 to follow a more southerly route as the Stevenson Expressway while Historic US 66 continues eastward on Joliet Road, passing by the historic Lyonsville Congregational Church at Wolf Road and traversing Countryside, Hodgkins and McCook. Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket in Willowbrook, listed on the National Register of Historic Places The original path of Route 66 on Joliet Road intersects the overlapping US 12/US 20/US 45 at LaGrange Road in Countryside before touching the edge of Hodgkins near East Avenue. A brief stretch of Route 66 in McCook between East Avenue and 55th Street west of First Avenue has been permanently damaged by a local quarry and is closed, and Historic US 66 detours onto East Avenue north to 55th Street east before intersecting again with Joliet Road. The detour around the quarry is well marked. In McCook, the route passes by the former Snuffy's 24-Hour Grill, now restored and transformed into the Steak N Egger on Route 66\\\\. Route 66's eastern terminus in Chicago, one block southeast of this Adams Street sign The route continues northeast on Joliet Road through McCook and Lyons, then jogs north briefly onto Harlem Avenue to Ogden Avenue in Berwyn, where it meets US 34\\\\. From Berwyn, Route 66 continues northeast on Ogden Avenue past the Berwyn Route 66 Museum, passing through Cicero before entering Chicago on a diagonal and progressing through the Greater Lawndale area, where it divides North Lawndale from South Lawndale before moving through Douglas Park, the Tri-Taylor Historic District and the Illinois Medical District on the Near West Side. Turning due east from Ogden Avenue once north of the I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway), Route 66 moves through the Jackson Boulevard Historic District toward the Chicago Loop via Jackson Boulevard. After a construction project during the early- to mid-1950s temporarily designated Jackson Boulevard as one-way east, Jackson Boulevard became one way eastbound permanently in 1955; thus, Route 66 from the West Loop through the downtown area was split, with the westbound lanes relocated to Adams Street. The eastern endpoint of US 66 was always at US 41\\\\. The original 1926 terminus was at Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue, as Michigan Avenue was designated US 41 in 1926. However, when US 41 through most of Chicago was relocated to Lake Shore Drive in 1938, Route 66 was extended an additional two blocks east on Jackson Drive through Grant Park, past Buckingham Fountain, to end at Lake Shore Drive on the shore of Lake Michigan. This last two-block section on Jackson Drive is two way; consequently, when Jackson was designated a one-way street in 1955, westbound Route 66 made a one-block long jog northbound on Michigan Avenue before continuing west on Adams. The current \\"End Historic Illinois U.S. Route 66\\" markers are located on Jackson (eastbound) and the \\"Start Historic Illinois U.S. Route 66\\" markers are on Adams (westbound) at Michigan Avenue, in the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District, in recognition of the original eastern terminus of US 66 at Michigan and Jackson. The historic eastern terminus is marked by the southwest corner of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Fountain of the Great Lakes in the Art Institute's South Garden along Michigan Avenue; both the museum and the fountain were already there long before the route's inauguration at that intersection in November 1926 and remain there today. Major intersections Distances listed are based on entering Illinois via the Veterans Memorial Bridge and following an alignment through Plainfield, using the last known non-freeway route where drivable. Structures =Filling stations= The fully restored Standard Oil Gasoline Station in Odell Filling stations were essential to the success of a trans-national road such as Route 66\\\\. Stations evolved their own unique design types and filling station architecture varied by period, at one time or another all major design types were represented along US 66 in Illinois. The existence of Route 66, and its alignment which ran parallel to much of the Chicago‚ÄìSt. Louis-running Chicago and Alton Railroad, itself made gasoline distribution simpler. The earliest gas stations were curbside but these were quickly rendered obsolete because of their tendency to back up traffic when a customer used the roadside pumps. The curbside filling station was the first type of business to use the actual term \\"filling station\\". Other types of gas stations evolved such as the house or cottage type, the house and canopy, the house and bays, and the oblong box type. Examples of extant filling stations along Route 66 in Illinois can be found in varying states of disrepair, and a few have been fully restored. =Restaurants= The Springfield Maid-Rite Sandwich Shop claims to be the nation's first drive-thru restaurant. In the early years of Route 66, many motorists brought their own food along with them and cooked it on the road. Constrained by tight finances and a mistrust of the unknown quality of road food, these earliest travelers were often reluctant to eat out. By the 1930s, this attitude had eased somewhat, and more motorists were eating out along the road. As drivers and automobiles on the road increased, so too did opportunities for fast food. One pioneer in this field was the White Castle chain, founded in 1921; the oldest White Castle restaurant on Route 66 is still in business in Berwyn. The road food trend was aided by entrepreneurs such as Howard Johnson who provided predictable, simple dishes‚Äîcomfort food for the weary traveler. Many of the first roadside caf√©s were part of motor camp complexes, but others, such as Johnson's started explicitly as cafes and evolved further from there. Large companies, such as Johnson's, or the Steak 'n Shake chain which began in Normal and was based on the pioneering idea of curbside service at the car, enjoyed success alongside what were mostly \\"mom- and pop\\" eateries dotting the Mother Road. The Ariston Caf√©, the longest- operating restaurant on US 66 Some locations along Route 66 in Illinois became known for their cuisine. One example is the state capital, Springfield. The city has long had an affiliation with food. The corn dog on a stick was invented in the city under the name \\"Cozy Dog\\", although there is some debate to the actual origin of the popular snack. The Cozy Dog Drive In has been a Springfield Route 66 staple since 1950. One of the first U.S. drive-thru restaurant windows is still in operation in Springfield on Route 66 at the Maid-Rite Sandwich Shop. The oldest restaurant still in operation along the entire stretch of US 66, nationwide, is the Ariston Caf√© in Litchfield. The Ariston is an excellent example of the type of mom and pop operation that flourished along Route 66 in Illinois, as is the Palms Grill Caf√© in Atlanta. Two others are the upstate fried-chicken rivals, White Fence Farm in Romeoville and Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket in Willowbrook. The former is a large, rambling, old-style farmhouse, the latter more like a cozy, neon-lit roadhouse where one can hear live blues on weekend nights; the farm offers an antique-filled gallery for visitors, the roadhouse a spate of Route 66 memorabilia, a neon fowl as its emblem, and loads of knick-knacks celebrating chickens. Each has its fans; both offer the traveler the comfort of a relaxed sit-down meal, and both continue to flourish as unique experiences on the route. =Camps, motor courts, and motels= Motorists along Route 66 during the 1920s usually carried the essentials with them and often simply set up camp on a rural roadside. Eventually, tourist camps began to spring up along the highway. At first, these campsites and cabins, offered for 25¬¢ and 50¬¢ apiece, were unfurnished; the tourist camps offered few amenities. As amentities such as communal toilets began to appear, travelers began to demand them. The camps gave way to motor courts that consisted of a row of cabins, then motor hotels, long buildings with individual rooms side by side and parking in front of them‚Äîthe name for which was in time shortened to simply \\"motel\\". =Bridges= Lost Braceville metal arch bridge Nearly all bridges along old Route 66 in Illinois are constructed from concrete, with very few exceptions. These concrete bridges are simple, lack ornamentation, and all of their major components‚Äîabutments, piers, floor beams, decks, stringers, and railings‚Äîwere constructed from concrete. The only ornamentation is found in the railings, which sometimes contained balusters. Between 1926 and 1940, most of the Route 66 bridges in Illinois were built as two-lane spans. Later incarnations built after 1940 had two lanes in each direction. One exception to these simple bridges was the now-demolished, magnificent steel bowstring arch bridge at Braceville. There are three notable exceptions that remain. All three are in the greater metropolitan Chicago area: the Jackson Boulevard and Adams Street Bridges over the South Branch of the Chicago River, and the Ruby Street Bridge over the Des Plaines River in Joliet. The Jackson, Adams and Ruby Street bridges are the only three remaining movable span bridges on the entire length of Route 66 in eight states, and they are marvels of modern engineering: Chicago-style double-leaf bascule trunnion bridges. The bridge at Adams Street and its neighbor at Jackson Boulevard are the only two single deck bridges in the city that represent the Plan of Chicago's ideal\\" downtown river bridge. The Jackson and Adams bridges are also among the oldest spans still in use along Route 66 and two of the busiest in Chicago‚Äîtherefore probably in the state‚Äîdue to their heavy volume of weekday pedestrian and commuter traffic crossing the bridges to and from nearby Union Station. =Museums and attractions= Illinois is home of various museums devoted to the history of US 66, such as the Berwyn Route 66 Museum in Berwyn, the Joliet Area Historical Museum's Route 66 Welcome Center, the Illinois Route 66 Association Hall of Fame and Museum in Pontiac, and the Cruisin' with Lincoln Visitors Center, inside the McLean County Museum of History in Bloomington, Illinois. Vehicles used by late Route 66 travelling artist Bob Waldmire, including a Volkswagen Type 2 minibus that inspired the creation of Pixar animated character Fillmore in the film Cars, are part of the museum collection in Pontiac. Two other museums of interest in Pontiac are the International Walldog Mural and Sign Art Museum and the Pontiac‚ÄìOakland Museum. The newest Route 66 museum is the Litchfield Museum and Route 66 Welcome Center, which opened in 2012 across from the Ariston Cafe. This museum houses an extensive history of the city of Litchfield and offers guided tours and special events. Artist Bob Waldmire's van at the Pontiac Route 66 Museum Route 66 in Illinois is also famous for some very quirky jumbo-size attractions, such as the former Bunyon's Paul Bunyan statue, a \\"Muffler Man\\" giant originally from a Berwyn hot dog shack that now stands in the quaint downstate community of Atlanta; the similar Gemini Giant in Wilmington; the largest wind farm East of the Mississippi River, Twin Groves Wind Farm, just east of Bloomington, with more than 240 turbines across ; the Railsplitter Covered Wagon in Lincoln, the world's largest according to Guinness Book of World Records; the Route 66 mural in Pontiac that depicts the world's largest US 66 shield; and the Tall Bunny at Henry's Ra66it Ranch in Staunton. There are a number of other attractions along Historic US 66 that are in the process of being restored, such as Sprague's Super Service gas station in Normal and The Mill on 66 restaurant in Lincoln. Both sites have received numerous grants and philanthropic donations, but are still in need of project funding to complete their restoration. The central Illinois section of Route 66 includes some of the territory that Lincoln the lawyer covered on the 8th Judicial Circuit. Here, visitors can see several Abraham Lincoln attractions as part of their Route 66 experience. In Springfield, there is the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln's Tomb, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site with a brand new exhibit of items from the Steven Spielberg movie Lincoln. In the town of Lincoln, which was named for the 16th president and christened by him in 1853, visitors can see the newly expanded Lincoln Heritage Museum on the campus of Lincoln College. Also, visitors can stop in at the David Davis Mansion in Bloomington to learn the story of how Davis became manager of Lincoln's presidential campaign and later was appointed by him to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. This section of Route 66 also offers two other interesting side trips: Illinois Amish Country and the Shelbyville State Fish and Wildlife Area. Significance US 66 has come to stand for the collective, American tourist experience and holds a special place in American popular culture. There is a certain nostalgic appeal to Route 66 that is associated with the thrill of the open road that has contributed to its popularity. Looking at the historic roadway through Illinois from a different perspective, it reveals a unique history that tells the story of movement and road building across the prairie. Study of the highway in Illinois also reveals the evolution of the Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of automobiles. Aside from the six sections of the route in Illinois that have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the entire stretch of US 66 through Illinois has been declared a National Scenic Byway and is alternatively known as the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway. The stretch of road was declared the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway on September 22, 2005 by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

It was written by the Northern Ireland folk singer and songwriter Tommy Sands. It was first recorded in 1985 by Robbie O'Connell, Mick Moloney and Jimmy Keane as the title track of their first joint album titled There Were Roses and incorrectly credited to \\"Moloney, O'Connell & Keane\\" on the Green Linnet label. Tommy Sands had also recorded his own song and it was the opening track of his 1985 album Singing of the Times. Context \\"There Were Roses\\" has been described as one of the best songs ever written about the Irish conflict known as The Troubles.Dna Users, Biography of Tommy Sands The song recounts the true story of two men, \\"Allan Bell\\" from Benagh, a Protestant and \\"Sean O'Malley\\" from South Armagh, a Catholic. The two were very close friends despite the political strife between the Catholic and Protestant communities and they would meet at Ryan Road, near Mayobridge in South County Down, where the Sands family have a farm. The Sands family were all musicians and singers and their house was a focal point for Catholic and Protestant neighbours to enjoy music and craic. That's how Sands had met them and \\"who were both good friends of mine\\" as in the lyrics. Sands had originally recorded the song using the real names of the two men, Scott and McDonnell, and did so with the agreement of their families. But just prior to the release of the album there was a change of heart on the part of one of the families. The already pressed LPs were destroyed and a new version of the song recorded using the fictitious names Bell and O'Malley. The song recounts the murder of 'Allan' just outside Newry Town by the Republican paramilitaries. In the aftermath, Loyalist paramilitaries \\"came prowling 'round the lonely Ryan Road' for a Catholic to kill in retaliation; ironically, the man they selected for the revenge killing (\\"to even up the score\\" as in the lyrics), was 'Sean' who pleaded for his life but he was not spared. Sands comments in the song lyrics: \\"I wonder just how many wars are fought between good friends / And those that give the orders are not the ones to die / It's Bell and O'Malley and the likes of you and I\\", concluding: The 'roses' in the title and chorus reflects Sands's memory of that summer and the roses blooming in an arch surrounding a seat outside his family home. In the album that Sands released there is no indication about the actual names of the two victims that Sands knew. The events of the song took place in the summer of 1973 and it took Sands ten years after the murders of the two friends to write the song. In certain cover versions, the names of the two young men are changed and \\"Allan Bell\\" is replaced by \\"Isaac Scott\\" and \\"Sean O'Malley\\" by \\"Sean McDonnell\\". For example, in the very well known Cara Dillon version in her album Sweet Liberty. Covers and adaptations It has also been recorded by Joan Baez, Kathy Mattea, Dolores Keane, Sean Keane, Frank Patterson, Paddy Reilly, Dick Gaughan, The Dubliners, Cara Dillon, Lisa McHugh and many others. Award In 2004 Sands and \\"There Were Roses\\" received the award for 'Best Original Song' at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In popular culture In May 2002 Sands received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Nevada, Reno for his outstanding work as musician and ambassador for peace and understanding. The song has also been translated into many languages and is currently included in the English language syllabus in German secondary schools.Tommy Sands.com Discography References External links *TraditionalMusic.co.uk: There Were Roses (Tommy Sands) 1985 songs British folk songs Songs about The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Irish folk songs ","title":"There Were Roses"},{"id":"4987994","text":"Moersdorf () is a small town in the commune of Mompach, in eastern Luxembourg. , the town has a population of 293.

Biologisches Centralblatt 29, 352‚Äì362 (1909) Over time, this pattern has been recognized in many additional cases, and generalized to what is now known as Emery's rule. The pattern is best known for various taxa of Hymenoptera. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitizes other members of its genus such as Dolichovespula norwegica and Dolichovespula arenaria.Carpenter, J. M., & Perera, E. P. (2006). Phylogenetic relationships among yellowjackets and the evolution of social parasitism (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Vespinae). American Museum Novitates, 1-19.Dvo≈ô√°k, L. (2007). Parasitism of Dolichovespula norwegica by D. adulterina (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Silva Gabreta, 13(1) 65-67. Emery's rule is also applicable to members of other kingdoms such as fungi, red algae, and mistletoe. The significance and general relevance of this pattern are still a matter of some debate, as a great many exceptions exist, though a common explanation for the phenomenon when it occurs is that the parasites may have started as facultative parasites within the host species itself (such forms of intraspecific parasitism are well-known, even in some species of bees), but later became reproductively isolated and split off from the ancestral species, a form of sympatric speciation. When a parasitic species is a sister taxon to its host in a phylogenetic sense, the relationship is considered to be in \\"strict\\" adherence to Emery's rule. When the parasite is a close relative of the host but not its sister species, the relationship is in \\"loose\\" adherence to the rule.Hines, H. M., & Cameron, S. A. (2010).

Founded in 1896, it is owned by the City and County of Denver and funded in part by the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD). It is the most popular paid attraction in the Denver metropolitan area. The Denver Zoo was started with the donation of an orphaned American black bear. With the construction of Bear Mountain, it became the first zoo in the United States to use naturalistic zoo enclosures rather than cages with bars. It expanded on this concept with Primate Panorama, featuring huge mesh tents and open areas for apes and monkeys, and with Predator Ridge, which has three separate areas through which animals are rotated so that their overlapping scents provide environmental enrichment. Toyota Elephant Passage, which opened on June 1, 2012, is divided into five areas for rotating the various species. The Denver Zoo is accredited by the (American) Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is also a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). The zoo achieved ISO 14001 certification in 2009, was given the first AZA Green Award in 2011, and was named the \\"Greenest Zoo in the Country\\" at the World Renewable Energy Forum in 2012. In 2015, it was re- certified for ISO 14001 and achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, becoming only the fourth zoo in the world to get both certifications. History =Early years= The Denver Zoo was founded in 1896 when an orphaned American black bear cub named Billy Bryan - short for William Jennings Bryan after the contemporary American politician - was given to Thomas S. McMurry (mayor of Denver from 1895‚Äì1899) as a gift. McMurry gave the hard-to-manage cub to the keeper of City Park, Alexander J. Graham, who started the zoo with this animal. Other animals at the young zoo included native waterfowl at Duck Lake, native prairie dogs, antelope which roamed the park, and a flock of Chinese pheasants, which later populated the eastern plains of the state. As this collection grew, the newly-formed park board continued to focus almost exclusively on acquiring native animals (with a notable pheasant collection and rhesus macaques as the exceptions) and some of the most popular animals at the park were large herds of bison and elk. In 1905, a population of red squirrels was added to the zoo's collection; this population grew rapidly and decimated the bird population at Duck Lake. A plan to shoot the squirrels was scrapped when citizens protested. Instead, as many squirrels as could be caught were sent to the Denver Mountain Parks. The south tip of Bear Mountain was originally intended for monkeys but now houses coati. =Mid-20th century= The zoo was a motley menagerie until 1906, when Mayor Robert W. Speer declared that the zoo's \\"[p]rison bars can be done away with\\" in favor of \\"concrete rocks, waterfalls, trees, etc.\\" Speer hired the city's landscape architect, Saco R. DeBoer, to draw up the plans for his renovation and appointed Victor H. Borcherdt as zoo director. Memorial marker to Velox Borcherdt designed the Bear Mountain exhibit, which opened in 1918. This structure is tall and long, and cost $50,000 to build. It was built of dyed and textured concrete forms cast from Dinosaur Mountain just outside Morrison, Colorado. Hidden moats replaced cage bars, and native plants and an artificial stream enhanced the natural look. The two main exhibits originally housed polar bears and grizzly bears. The south tip of the exhibit was designed to resemble Mesa Verde National Park. Originally it housed monkeys, but due to escape problems California sea lions were housed there instead. Between 1941 and 1961 it housed a female polar bear named Velox, who became the mascot of the 31st U.S. Infantry Regiment in 1952. Velox died at the zoo in 1961 and a memorial stone for her is displayed at the zoo. Bear Mountain established Denver as one of the foremost among American zoos, and the Saint Louis Zoo hired Borcherdt after seeing the exhibit. Although other zoos in the region made extensive use of New Deal funds to upgrade their facilities, only one notable addition was made to the Denver Zoo between 1918 and 1950. Monkey Island was built in 1937 using funds from the Works Progress Administration. Mayor Benjamin F. Stapleton funded the zoo very little, and it was in poorly maintained condition when Mayor Quigg Newton was elected in 1947. Newton hired DeBoer, the architect involved with the zoo's design forty years before, to plan a rebirth. Starting with the 1950 overhaul of Monkey Island, the zoo has steadily added to and improved its exhibits. The Denver Zoological Foundation was created in 1950, the same year that the zoo acquired its first elephant, Cookie. A Children's zoo was opened in 1951 (since replaced by Primate Panorama). A perimeter fence was built in 1957, defining the zoo as a separate area but still within City Park. Automobile traffic in the zoo was finally eliminated completely in 1959. Pachyderm Habitat was opened the same year, and Cookie was joined by a second elephant, Candy. The zoo opened the Feline House in 1964, a Giraffe House in 1966, and an Animal Hospital in 1969. Bird World was opened in 1975, followed by the Mountain Sheep Habitat in 1979, Northern Shores for polar bears, Arctic foxes, North American river otters, and pinnipeds in 1987, and Wolf Pack Woods in 1988. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 made it impossible to keep the polar bears and sea lions in the Bear Mountain enclosure. This and its deteriorating condition lead to a $250,000 renovation of the exhibit starting in 1987. The exhibit reopened in 1989 with grizzly bears and Asiatic black bears occupying the northern two exhibits and coatis in the southern tip. =1990s-present= In 1993, the zoo opened the $11.5 million Tropical Discovery exhibit. Designed by the Denver architectural firm Anderson Mason Dale, this indoor tropical garden topped by glass pyramids is the aquarium and herpetarium of the Denver Zoo, and its opening doubled both the number of species and the number of animals at the zoo. Along with the animals, 90% of which had never been on display at the zoo, there are over 250 species of plants represented in the exhibit. On November 6, 1994, twin polar bear cubs Klondike and Snow were born to a first- time mother named Ulu, who rejected the cubs. They were successfully raised by zoo staff and became a popular attraction. The bears were transferred to SeaWorld Orlando. In 2012 Snow was transferred from Sea World in Orlando, Florida to the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, where she died unexpectedly on September 2, 2012.. Klondike died at SeaWorld Orlando on September 13, 2013. Their story is commemorated at the Denver Zoo by a bronze sculpture located across from the main polar bear viewing area.. On February 24, 2007, a jaguar mauled zookeeper Ashlee Pfaff inside the animal's enclosure. The jaguar was shot and killed by the zoo's emergency response team while rescuing Pfaff, who later died of her injuries at a local hospital. This event occurred despite zoo policy prohibiting direct contact between keepers and big cats. An investigation by the zoo concluded the attack was the result of human error by Pfaff. For a short time in early 2007, the zoo's jaguar exhibit remained empty until the arrival of replacement jaguar Caipora. The zoo has not had jaguars since 2010. In 2009, the Denver Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to achieve ISO 14001 certification. City park rebuilt its greenhouses in 2009, and as part of this project was able to provide the zoo with its own dedicated greenhouse. That same year, Denver Zoo celebrated the birth of an endangered aye-aye that was the first of the species to be conceived and born in a North American zoo. The zoo has continued to have a successful breeding program. In 2010, the zoo, in cooperation with the City and County of Denver, drained Duck Lake in order to remove sediment buildup and improve its water quality. Duck Lake is part of City Park but not part of the zoo. It is a major nesting area for black-crowned night herons and snowy egrets in the state. The nature walk along the lake shore was upgraded as part of the Asian Tropics project. In 2012, the zoo opened the $50 million Toyota Elephant Passage. The exhibit was originally announced in 2006 as Asian Tropics, and bids for a general contractor were sent out in June 2009. The exhibit was constructed by the Kiewit Building Group and groundbreaking was on December 2, 2009. It was opened to the general public on June 1, 2012. In 2015, following conservation work with researchers around Lake Titicaca in Peru, Denver Zoo welcomed 20 Lake Titicaca frogs from the Huachipa Zoo and later became the first zoo outside South America to breed the rare amphibians. Some have moved to other institutions in hopes of building a healthy captive population that can be released back into the lake in the future. In nearby Colombia, the zoo released Andean condors in 2010 and 2012. Interior of Denver Zoo's Tropical Discovery Exhibits The Denver Zoo houses species from all over the world, including hoofed mammals, carnivorous mammals, primates, pachyderms, birds, reptiles, and fish. The zoo's animal collection contains 3,500 specimens representing 550 unique species. The zoo is laid out in a large loop, with exhibits both inside and outside the loop. Current exhibits include the following: =Bear Mountain= This historic exhibit, on the National Register of Historic Places and originally opened in 1918, is one of the first natural- style zoo exhibits in North America and the first to use simulated concrete rocks. It underwent a $250,000 restoration between 1987 and 1989. After Bear Mountain's grizzly bears were moved to a newer exhibit, it has become home to smaller species like cinereous vultures and a North American porcupine. Primate Panorama has plenty of room for its orangutans =Primates= Primate Panorama spreads over and primarily houses apes and other larger primates. Tree-dwelling apes and monkeys live in open-air wire mesh tents that soar four stories high and cover more than an acre of ground. Inside these tents, primates like ring-tailed lemurs (which also live in the Emerald Forest building), Wolf's guenons, black-and-white colobus, red-crowned mangabeys, golden-cheeked gibbons, siamangs and Debrazza's monkeys can play and climb on twisting vines. Western lowland gorillas roam freely, climbing ropes and taking afternoon hammock naps in one of the largest gorilla habitats in the world. Sumatran orangutans have their own outdoor habitat where they can climb trees and swing in hammocks. Jewels of the Emerald Forest pavilion is situated near the entrance to Primate Panorama and features a meandering trail through diorama replicas showing different primate environments: Madagascar, South America and primates of the night. Animals housed here include the aye-aye, pale-headed saki and golden lion tamarin. Connecting to the building is an island exhibit that's home to red-ruffed lemurs. The nearby Shamba offers a view of a Central West African village and is home to red river hogs, mandrills and rhinoceros hornbills. Monkey Island was built in 1937 with funds from the Works Progress Administration. It was rehabilitated in 1950. During the warmer months, it is inhabited by hooded capuchins. It is surrounded by a moat that also houses some aquatic birds, including white pelicans, in the summer. The moat is drained in the winter and the monkeys are housed in the Monkey House. Monkey House, facing Monkey Island, was the original primate exhibit in the zoo and still houses several species of monkeys, including those that are released on Monkey Island in the summer as well as black-handed spider monkeys and Hanuman langurs. Predator Ridge is designed to represent the African savanna =Cats= Predator Ridge is a large exhibit representing the African savanna. It has the ability to rotate different African predators like African lions, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs, whose overlapping scents provide environmental enrichment for the animals. Other species exhibited in smaller kopje exhibits include Kirk's dik-diks and African crested porcupines. Feline House was built in 1964. In its heyday, lions, tigers, jaguars, Amur leopards, snow leopards, striped hyenas, fossa, red pandas, dwarf mongooses, maned wolves, northern tree shrews and bat-eared foxes called the building home. Much of the building is now closed and has been renovated in some areas to make way for Stingray Cove as well as exercise yards for certain animals from the zoo's education collection: including macaws, a serval and Patagonian cavy. The Edge is a newly designed exhibit modeled after the pine forests of Russia for the zoo's Amur tigers. Two yards with large pools and pathways that wander over visitors' heads provide enrichment and exercise for the tigers. This is the first of several rotational exhibits that will make up a new Asian Predators area, giving the zoo's other big cats larger and more dynamic habitats. It opened to the public in March 2017, replacing Wolf Pack Woods, which opened in 1988. Cheetahs have their own large enclosure across from Pachyderm Habitat. Cats elsewhere include Fishing cats and clouded leopards, both in Toyota Elephant Passage. =Pachyderm Habitat= Opened in 1959, the Pachyderm Habitat is currently home to Black rhinoceros and river hippopotamus. The Asian elephants and Malayan tapirs were moved to the Toyota Elephant Passage prior to its opening in June 2012. As of summer 2015, the Pachyderm Habitat is also home to a special area for children called the Be a Zookeeper Zone where they can learn how to be a zookeeper or meet small animals from the education collection. Two llamas named Jorge and Fernando came to the zoo for the new area. =Hoofed mammals= Hoofed mammals are generally housed in the center of the zoo. Hoofed mammals at the Denver zoo (clockwise from the entrance) are Grevy's zebras, reticulated giraffes, Bactrian camels, okapis, Somali wild asses, a Vietnamese potbellied pig named Charlie, a variety of antelope species including eastern bongo, addax, lesser kudu and southern gerenuk, as well as Cape buffalo. Denver Zoo is also one of only a few zoos in the world to house a breeding herd of Przewalski's horses. Other species exhibited in the hoofed mammal yards include Abyssinian ground hornbills with the kudu, red kangaroos and emus in an Australian habitat and west African crowned cranes with the gerenuk. Giraffe House was created in 1966 and, along with the outdoor giraffe run, houses the zoo's giraffe herd. Mountain Sheep Habitat was opened in 1979. It contains two natural-style \\"mountains\\" housing Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats. Hoofed animals elsewhere include the red river hog and the yellow-backed duiker, both in Primate Panorama. Cinereous vultures build a nest on Denver Zoo's Nurture Trail. =Birds= The original aviary currently houses the bald eagle and Andean condor, and an attached building is the winter quarters for American and Chilean flamingos. Lorikeet Adventure, the Nurture Trail, and the Avian Propagation Center all opened in 2006. Lorikeet Adventure is a large, open-air mesh tent where visitors can mingle with and feed a variety of lorikeet species such as rainbow, scarlet-breasted and coconut lorikeets; it is also the home of a blue-streaked lory, the only typical lory in the exhibit. The Nurture Trail is a short trail through a forested glade home to two exhibits: one for red-crowned cranes and one for sarus cranes. The trail then goes past smaller outdoor enclosures attached to the Avian Propagation Center, which provides the Denver Zoo with state-of-the- art facilities for breeding and raising all types of birds. The Forest Aviary in Primate Panorama is a area richly landscaped and enclosed in a nearly invisible wire mesh. Visitors can walk around inside with the birds, which include the helmeted curassow, east African crowned crane, Egyptian vulture and waldrapp ibis. Humboldt penguins are housed north of Bear Mountain. Former bird exhibits included: Bird Garden, an open-air mesh tent home to exotic birds including kookaburras, great argus and Cabot's tragopans.https://web.archive.org/web/20040831125643/http://www.denverzoo.org/vr/garden.htm It was taken down on December 2, 2009, alongside enclosures for yaks, American bison, Mishmi takin, waterbuck, Ankole-Watusi cattle, muskoxen, Pallas' cats, mountain lions, reindeer and white-lipped deer, to make way for Toyota Elephant Passage. Bird World was open from 1975‚Äì2019. Despite its closure on October 1, some iconic species, such as Linne's two-toed sloths and African penguins, will remain at the zoo. =Northern Shores= Northern Shores was opened in 1987 and features grizzly bears, California sea lions, and harbor seals. It was home to the famous polar bear cubs Klondike and Snow. While the zoo has long-term plans for a new, innovative exhibit for polar bears, the former polar bear exhibit no longer houses the species and in May 2019 was renovated and reopened as Harmony Hill. A much larger exhibit for the zoo's grizzly bears, this portion of Northern Shores provides a habitat modeled after the fictional Harmony Hill State Park and a second habitat modeled after a backyard to illustrate and provide solutions for human-wildlife conflict. Cave and underwater viewing windows are located in the bear and sea lion exhibits respectively. =Tropical Discovery= Lake Titicaca frogs in Tropical Discovery. Tropical Discovery was opened in 1993 as the zoo's herpetarium and aquarium. The building explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip begins with a view into a South American river with different species of river fishes then continues to a cave featuring several bat species including the short-tailed bat, Jamaican fruit bat and vampire bat, as well as blind cave fish. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species from around the world including the snouted cobra, eyelash viper and neotropical rattlesnakes. Animals seen in the Rainforest area include the black howler monkey, green anaconda, archerfish and an array of poison dart frogs. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with false percula clownfish, lionfish, queen angelfish, spotted garden eels and more. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from the alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, the Siamese crocodile also enjoys a large pool near the Matamata turtle and the Discovery Room, which features other small species like the frilled lizard. Dragons of Komodo was the largest Komodo dragon exhibit of its kind since it opened in 1999 and is still one of the largest Komodo dragon exhibits in the country. As well as housing Komodo dragons, Dragons of Komodo is home to other island reptiles like rhinoceros iguanas and giant New Caledonia geckos. =Toyota Elephant Passage= One of the gibbon islands Toyota Elephant Passage is a $50 million exhibit. At its opening, it was the largest bull elephant habitat in the world, designed to house up to 12 elephants, 8 of them bulls. This arrangement allows the zoo to conduct behavioral research related to the recent discovery that bull elephants (originally thought to be solitary) form loose bachelor herds in the wild when not breeding with matriarchal herds. The exhibit houses Asian elephants and other animals such as greater one-horned rhinoceros (also known as Indian rhinoceros) and Malayan tapirs, which rotate among different habitats in the same style as Predator Ridge. It includes more than of trails for the animals, and pools in the exhibit contain a total of . Northern white- cheeked gibbons swing directly over a boardwalk for visitors, traveling between three islands. Clouded leopards and sarus cranes live in nearby yards. The exhibit includes an indoor facility for smaller species like fishing cats, Asian small-clawed otters, great hornbills and green tree pythons and it provides important breeding facilities for the Indian rhino and Asian elephant in North America. The exhibit opened with two female elephants (Mimi and Dolly) and two bull elephants (Bodhi and Groucho). The zoo made history in 2013 by transporting Billy, a bull elephant from Belgium's Antwerp Zoo, via plane to the new exhibit. This marked the first time in over 30 years an Asian elephant had been imported into the United States and one of the few times the genetics of the European population would mix with the North American population. In October 2018, bull elephants Chuck and Jake came to the exhibit from the African Lion Safari in Ontario. This move made Denver's herd the largest Asian elephant bachelor herd in the world with five bulls. On February 22, 2020, the first Indian rhino calf in the zoo's history was born as the result of artificial insemination. At its opening, the exhibit contained a waste-to-energy gasification system that allowed organic waste (i.e. uneaten food, animal waste, etc...) to be burned in an oxygen-deprived environment in order to create energy. The system powered outdoor hot tubs for the elephants and Denver Zoo's goal was to be \\"Zero Waste\\" by 2020, powering the whole facility with waste. Those involved with the project reported that no adverse byproducts would be released when the system was running but several surrounding residents were concerned that the gasification process would create an unpleasant odor around the zoo. These concerns resulted in ending the gasification project at Denver Zoo. Since the decision in 2015, the zoo is seeking partners to continue the project with offsite. Nonetheless, the exhibit and its buildings have received LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. = Stingray Cove = Stingray Cove is a seasonal, interactive exhibit featuring an 18,000 gallon shaded open-air aquarium housing cownose rays, white-spotted and brown-banded bamboo sharks, southern stingrays, shovelnose guitarfish and bonnethead sharks. Guests are able to gently touch, feel, and feed the rays as they swim around the tank. Admission to the exhibit (which includes one piece of food for feeding to the rays) will cost $5 in addition to zoo entry. The exhibit opened in late June of 2020. =Traveling Exhibits= Denver Zoo has hosted several traveling exhibits in recent years to raise awareness for conservation efforts. Traveling exhibits brought to the zoo have included \\"Nature Connects, Art With Lego¬Æ Bricks,\\" \\"Washed Ashore, Art to Save the Sea\\" and \\"Dinos! Live at Denver Zoo.\\" Other facilities Endangered Species Carousel The Conservation Carousel features hand-carved wooden replicas of some of Denver's most popular residents including a polar bear mom and cubs, giraffes, okapi and baby gorilla, along with many other endangered animals. The Denver Zoo Railroad presented by Union Pacific offers a quick trip around the zoo's carousel meadow filled with beautiful lush foliage, under the shade of 100-year-old trees. Visitors can see American and Chilean flamingos and other waterfowl just outside the Primate Panorama exhibit. Denver Zoo Railroad is the first natural gas-powered zoo train in the United States. The Animal Hospital in Denver zoo was built in 1969. The Gates Wildlife Conservation Education Center houses classrooms and meeting rooms for public and private (rental) use. The Wild Encounters outdoor amphitheater is designed for wildlife presentations and is located just outside the Gates Center. Education and conservation Flamingo talk showcased Juvenile American flamingos during the summer of 2009 Throughout the day the Denver Zoo provides educational opportunities for visitors, including the sea lion demonstration, pachyderm demonstration, wildlife show, Wild Encounters, Predator Ridge demonstration, red river hog feeding, penguin feeding, Meet the Animal Stars, and others. Some of these are seasonal, and some (like the flamingo talk every day during the summer of 2009) showcase specific animals that have been raised at the zoo. In 2014, a paid, mobile app titled the Denver Zoo Audio Tour became available, providing zoo visitors with the ability to hear short, educational presentations about numerous zoo animals. The Denver Zoo is part of the (American) Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan for many species. As an active member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), Denver Zoo works with other zoos and aquariums around the world to respond to the global extinction crisis facing the world's frogs and other amphibians. Denver Zoo works with conservationists in Peru to save wild populations of the endangered Lake Titicaca frog and Lake Junin giant frog. Amphibian experts with the zoo have had rare success breeding boreal toads, listed as endangered in several western states, and have released over 600 young toads in southwestern Utah. The Denver Zoo also has a storied history with the American bison as it was one of the first zoos to assist in nationwide efforts to save the species from extinction. A breeding herd of five bison arrived at the zoo in 1899. The zoo no longer houses the species but manages a herd on the Rio Mora National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico and also contributed animals to both the Genesee herd near Denver and the Heartland Ranch herd near Lamar. The latter herd, behaving naturally on thousands of acres and with the help of the Southern Plains Land Trust, almost entirely returned the ecosystem to its natural state as of 2019. Denver Zoo's conservation efforts are coordinated by the Department of Conservation Biology. Through continued research and funding, the Department helps to conserve a variety of species worldwide. Although the zoo has been active in conservation and research since its founding in 1896, the establishment of the Department of Conservation Biology provides dedicated staff and funding to support hundreds of projects throughout the world. Events Boo at the Zoo is held every Halloween and is great fun for children. Zoo Lights is open during December evenings. This is a spectacular stroll through a wonderland of lights, many of them animated and representing animals at the zoo.

Since the early 1980s, the Austrian musician and songwriter Helmut Glavar has founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave and drums-and-bass. Piers Oak-Rhind was born in England and has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s. He studied guitar at the London School of Guitar. According to the two members, the music mixes \\"coloristic electrophonics\\" with \\"impressionistic orchestra-like sound\\".http://www.entheogenic.net/bio--media-- contact.html The use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal-sounding instruments, and an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound. According to some people, Entheogenic was one of the two major psybient projects (the other being Shpongle) whose experimentation influenced the psychedelic electronic scene. Entheogenic's first release Entheogenic is a concept album that recounts the tale of an Ayahuasca journey, with layered trance melodies and texturally rich arrangements. Three labels bid for the release: the former UK-based Flying Rhino, the German-based Cosmophilia and the Spanish 3D Vision. The album was released on 3D Vision Records. In 2003, their second album Spontaneous Illumination, released on c.o.r.n. recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German chill-out charts. Their first two albums were noted for their epic thematic lengthy tunes. Both albums feature the work of sound engineer Glenn Schick (Morcheeba, Ludacris etc.) In 2005, Dialogue of the Speakers (Chillcode Records) continued the success of its predecessor, and went straight to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained for 24 weeks. Golden Cap (Chillcode Records) was released in 2006 and was received by their then quite large following with a love-hate attitude. History =Background= Entheogenic was formed in 1999 by producer, engineer, and songwriter Piers Oak-Rhind and Helmut Glavar. The duo met while working for Emagic (a former producer of music-studio software and hardware such as Logic, acquired by Apple Inc. in 2002). The name Entheogenic is derived from the term Entheogen coined in 1979 by a group of ethnobotanists and mythology scholars to describe psychedelic substances used in a religious or shamanic context. German \\"Chill-Out\\" charts In November 2003, Entheogenic's second album, Spontaneous Illumination, released on the German label C.O.R.N. Recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained Number 1 for 8 weeks and stayed in the Top 10 for an additional 12 weeks.

In 1898 he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts.Johann Kaspar Julius Ficker von Feldhaus Orden Pour le M√©rite f√ºr Wissenschaften und K√ºnste (Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts) (in German) Career Born at Paderborn, Ficker studied history and law at Bonn, M√ºnster, and Berlin, and during 1848-49 lived in Frankfurt, where he was closely associated with the noted historian Johann Friedrich B√∂hmer, who proved himself a generous friend and patron. In 1852 he proceeded to Bonn, but shortly afterwards accepted an invitation from Count Leopold Thun-Hohenstein, the reorganizer of the Austrian system of education, to settle at Innsbruck as professor of general history. In 1863, however, he joined the faculty of jurisprudence, and his lectures on political and legal history drew around him a large circle of devoted and admiring pupils. In 1866 he was elected member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but retired, after being ennobled by the Emperor of Austria, Franz Joseph, in 1879. The Sybel-Ficker controversy During the period 1859-1866, triggered by the publication of Giesebrecht's Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit, he was engaged in a literary controversy with the historian Heinrich von Sybel on the significance of the Holy Roman Empire. Ficker advocated and defended the theory that Austria, on account of its blending of races, was best fitted as successor of the old empire to secure the political advancement both of Central Europe and of Germany. In support of his theory, he wrote Das deutsche Kaiserreich in seinen universalen und nationalen Beziehungen (Innsbruck, 1871), and Deutsches K√∂nigtum und Kaisertum (Innsbruck, 1872). As legatee of B√∂hmer's literary estate, he published the Acta Imperii selecta (Innsbruck, 1870) and directed the completion and revision of the Regesta Imperii. Julius von Ficker died in Innsbruck. His sons were also prominent. Ludwig von Ficker (1880-1967) was a publisher and essayist who promoted and published the work of his friend, Georg Trakl. Heinrich von Ficker (1881-1957) was a meteorologist, geophysicist and explorer. Rudolf von Ficker (1886-1954) was a musicologist. Works Ficker's numerous and important works extend over three branches of scientific history: political and legal history and the science of diplomatics. In each division he discovered new methods of investigation. Among his writings those of especial note are: =Political history= *Rainald von Dassel, Reichskanzler und Erzbischof von K√∂ln (Cologne, 1850) *M√ºnsterische Chroniken des Mittelalters (M√ºnster, 1851) *Engelbert der Heilige, Erzbischof von K√∂ln (Cologne, 1853) *Die √úberreste des deutschen Reichsarchivs in Pisa (Vienna, 1855). =Legal history= *√úber einen Spiegel deutscher Leute (Vienna, 1857) *√úber die Entstehungszeit des Sachsenspiegels (Innsbruck 1859) *Vom Reichsf√ºrstenstande (Innsbruck, 1861) *Forschungen zur Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte Italiens (4 vols., Innsbruck, 1868‚Äì74) *Untersuchungen zur Rechtsgeschichte (3 vols., Innsbruck, 1891‚Äì97). =Diplomatics= *Beitr√§ge zur Urkundenlehre (2 vols., Innsbruck, 1877‚Äì78).

The earliest Kannada language inscriptions are attributed to the Kadambas of Banavasi.Ramesh (1984), p2, pp10-11 Early life The Talagunda pillar inscription of about c.455 provides insights into the life of Mayurasharma and the Kadamba lineage There are several legends and tales that describe the progeny of the Kadamba family. One legend states the family descended from a three-eyed, four-armed being called Trilochana Kadamba who sprang to life from the drops of sweat from the forehead of Shiva falling at the roots of a Kadamba tree. Another legend states Mayurasharma was born of Rudra (a form a Shiva) and the mother earth under an auspicious Kadamba tree and that he was born with a third eye on his forehead. According to yet another tale, Mayurasharma was born to the sister of a Jain Muni under a Kadamba tree. It appears that all these legends evolved so as to present the founder of the kingdom as a demi-god.Moraes (1931), pp7-8 The Talagunda inscription of 450 is considered the most reliable source of information about the family of Mayurasharma and the origin of the Kingdom. The inscription is known to be free of legends, giving a realistic and true account of the Kadamba line of kings.Rice in Moraes (1931), p15 According to the inscription, Mayurasharma was a Vaidika Brahmin scholar and a native of Talagunda. He was the son of Bandhushena, grandson of his guru (teacher) Veerasharma and a student at the Agrahara (place of learning) in Talagunda.Ramesh (1984), p3 The inscription confirms the family is named for the Kadamba tree that grew near the family home. It is further claimed that they were a Kannadiga Dravidian family inducted into the Brahminic fold as was popular in the medieval times.There is no sound historical basis or inscriptional evidence to prove a northern origin or a southern migration of the ancestors of the Kadambas (Moraes 1931, p17) The Gudnapur inscription further confirms Mayurasharma's parentage and that he acquired the character of a Kshatriya. Birth of a kingdom According to the Talagunda inscription, Mayurasharma went to Kanchi the capital of the Pallavas to pursue his Vedic studies accompanied by his guru and grandfather Veerasharma. Kanchi was an important Ghatikasthana (centre of learning) at that time. There, having been humiliated by a Pallava guard (horseman), in a rage Mayurasharma gave up his Brahminic studies and took to the sword to avenge his insult.Ramesh (1984), p6 The inscription vividly describes the event thus: It can be said that the rise of Mayurasharma against the Pallava hold over the Talagunda region was actually a successful rebellion of Brahmins against the domination of the Kshatriya power as wielded by the Pallavas of Kanchi. Thus was born, in a moment of righteous indignation, the first Kingdom native to present day Karnataka region. Other scholars however feel Mayurasharma's rebellion was well timed to coincide with the defeat of Pallava Vishnugopa by the southern invasion of Samudragupta of northern India.George Moraes and Nilakanta Sastri in Kamath (2001), p31 Mayurasharma first succeeded in establishing himself in the forests of Shriparvata (possibly modern Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh) by defeating the Antharapalas (guards) of the Pallavas and subduing the Banas of Kolar. The Pallavas under Skandavarman were unable to contain Mayurasharma and recognised him as a sovereign in the regions from the Amara ocean (western ocean) to Prehara (Malaprabha river).According to Professor Kielhorn who deciphered the Talagunda inscription, the extent of his kingdom may have been up to Premara or ancient Malwa in central India (Moraes 1931, p16) Some historians feel that Mayurasharma was initially appointed as a commander (dandanayaka) in the army of the Pallavas, as the inscription uses such terms as Senani and calls Mayurasharma Shadanana (six-faced god of war). However, after a period of time, availing himself of the confusion caused by the defeat of Pallava Vishnugopa by Samudragupta (from the Allahabad inscriptions), Mayurasharma carved out a kingdom with Banavasi (near Talagunda) as his capital.Moraes (1931), p16 It is also known that in other battles, Mayurasharma defeated the Traikutas, Abhiras, Sendrakas, Pallavas, Pariyathrakas, Shakasthana, the Maukharis and Punnatas.From the Chandravalli inscription of Mayurashrama (Kamath 2001, p31) To celebrate his successes, Mayurasharma performed many horse sacrifices and granted 144 villages (known as brahmadeyas) to Brahmins of Talagunda.from the Halasi plates of Kakushtavarma, great-grandson of Mayurasharma (Moraes 1931, p17) With an effort to rejuvenate the ancient Brahminic faith and to perform the royal rituals and the related functions of the government, Mayurasharma invited learned Vaidika Brahmins from Ahichatra. The Havyaka Brahmins claim descent from these early Brahmin settlers of the 4th century called the Ahichatra brahmins or the Ahikaru/Havikaru. In popular media Mayurasharma was the protagonist in the 1975 Kannada film Mayura starring Rajkumar. The story is a depiction of the early years of conflict with the Pallava rulers and Mayurasharma's eventual ascension to the Kadamba throne. Notes References * George M.

Disney Interactive Studios has stated that Spectrobes is its first original intellectual property; that is, a game not based on any film or TV program from its parent company. The game was considered a commercial success and Disney Interactive Studios announced that more than 700,000 copies of the game had shipped worldwide in the first month and it was the best-selling third-party (not published by Nintendo, Microsoft, or Sony) game for March 2007, ranking #7 over all that month. The game was re-released in November 2007 as part of a special Spectrobes: Collector's Edition bundle, which included the game itself, all thirty-eight input code cards plus two exclusive Geo input cards, and a mini- guide. Plot Out on a routine mission, Nanairo Planetary Patrol Officers Rallen and Jeena respond to a strange distress signal and discover the wreckage of an escape capsule in which an old man has been in a cryogenic sleep for over a decade. Once conscious, the man, whose name is Aldous, relays an unbelievable tale of the attack on his home planet by a vicious horde of creatures known as the Krawl. Rallen, Jeena, and Aldous then set out on a mission to save Nanairo from the destructive planet-eating Krawl. After fighting the Krawl on five of Nanairo's seven planets, Rallen's boss, Commander Grant, reveals that the Krawl had established a base on the seventh planet, Meido; however, their spaceship is incapable of reaching this planet. Aldous reveals that ancient ruins found on one of the planets are actually a spaceship from an earlier civilization, and that it may be able to reach Meido. After gathering a number of Keystones, they are able to resurrect the spaceship and reach the Meido. After fighting through more hordes of Krawl, Rallen fights a large Krawl called Xelles that has the ability to heal whatever comes near it. After defeating it, Rallen fights a final Leader Krawl and kills it, thus ending the invasion - temporarily.

However, it's not a compelling one either. Gamers that have short attention spans and don't mind boring, repetitive gameplay may want to give it a try. However, everyone else will be wise to wait for the next true Pok√©mon releases to hit the system.\\" Sequel The sequel to Spectrobes, entitled Spectrobes: Beyond the Portals, was released in the U.S. on October 7, 2008. It features a new third-person 3-D field perspective and a map on the top screen. With this sequel, players can choose to play as either Rallen or Jeena.

South is one of three high schools in the Williamsville Central School District, along with Williamsville North High School and Williamsville East High School. History =Origins, 1853-1892= In 1853, the Williamsville Classical Institute was formed as a private school to provide education in Williamsville beyond the elementary level. The property on Academy Street was purchased for $700. The first catalog was published in 1857, but the Williamsville Classical Institute (which had become known as the \\"Academy\\") eventually closed in 1869. In 1874, School District No. 3 rented the building for use as an elementary school.Sue Miller Young, A History of the Town of Amherst, New York, Chap. 15 (1965) =Academy Street School, 1892-1950= Union Free School District No. 3 was organized on May 7, 1892.Town of Amherst, from Our County and Its People, A Descriptive Work on Erie County, New York, Truman C. White, ed. (The Boston History Company, 1898) The Board of Education purchased the property and building from the Institute for $250, naming it Union Free School No. 3, and added a high school program. The first Regents exams were held there in 1892 and its first graduating class consisted of five students in 1895. The first principals were George E. Smith, W. M. Pierce, and D.B. Albert, who had five assistants in 1898. By 1902, there were 65 high school students and 143 in the elementary program. By 1921, the original red brick building had been condemned by the State Department of Education as antiquated and unsanitary. The public voted to demolish the old building and rebuild at the same site for a cost of $122,000. The new building was opened in 1924, although the auditorium was completed in time for the graduation of the Class of 1923. A large addition was built in 1931 and the curriculum was enlarged. After the opening of the current building on Main Street in 1950, the 1920s-era Academy Street building continued in use as an elementary school for a time, and eventually also a middle school. In 1981, the Christian Central Academy rented the then-vacant Academy Street School, eventually purchasing the property from the Williamsville Central School District in 1985. In 1991, the Williamsville Historical Society declared and marked that location as an historic site.Christian Central Academy -- Heritage =Williamsville High School= Due to rapid growth and expansion, the Williamsville Central School District was formed and a new location was needed for the middle and high school students. The current building on Main Street was constructed for an approved cost of $2.5 million, and opened as Williamsville Junior and Senior High School in September 1950, serving grades 7-12. The building was re-designated as Williamsville Senior High following the opening of Mill Middle School in 1958, and finally as South High following the opening of North High School in 1968.South High School Added to Register of Historic Places, Amherst Bee, August 6, 2008 The building was designed by acclaimed local architect Duane Lyman, who was known as the dean of Western New York architecture. Its construction features classic columns and a traditional clock tower. A science wing was added to the building's east side in 1961, and a new athletics wing was added to the north side in 1992. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as \\"Williamsville Junior and Senior High School\\") in 2008.

History A variety of indigenous peoples inhabited Ohio for centuries, among them the Adena and Hopewell cultures. After their decline, others moved in. The French colonials found in central Ohio a variety of nations, including Delaware, Miami, Mingo, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot.http://internal.genoatwp.com/community/history/default.aspx The latter were among the last to remain until forced out in 1843.https://www.dispatch.com/article/20130818/NEWS/308189783 The Marcus Curtis Inn, constructed in 1822, was placed on the National Register in 1976. The first European settlement of Genoa Township occurred adjacent to the eastern banks of Big Walnut Creek, which had been named by early settlers for the dense growth of black walnut trees, which grew along it. Due to the fact that much of the land was covered with dense forests, waterways such as Big Walnut Creek were a primary source of identification and transportation. In 1806, Jeremiah Curtiss of Connecticut became the first non-indigenous settler. He built a sawmill, a gristmill and a still along the bank of Big Walnut Creek. Though he moved to Marietta in 1811, his son, John Curtiss, returned to the township following the death of his father on June 21, 1813. Jeremiah's brother, Marcus, arrived in 1808 and around 1812 established the Marcus Curtiss Inn. The original inn was a log structure, but by 1822 a brick inn had been constructed. This structure still stands on Sunbury Road and is now a private residence. Both Jeremiah and Marcus are buried in Copeland Cemetery located on Yankee Street, adjacent to the eastern banks of Hoover Reservoir.http://delawareo.com/2014/05/03/take-a-journey-through-genoa/ The Township was officially established in 1816, having been sectioned off from neighboring Harlem Township. The Township was named after Genoa, Italy, the birthplace of explorer Christopher Columbus, having been suggested by an early settler of the Township named Elisha Bennett. Unlike its namesake, the Township's name is pronounced with the stress on the second syllable, as ge- NO-a. Genoa Township is the only township named as such statewide. However, there is a village of Genoa located in Ottawa County, Ohio. A relatively large portion of the Township is consumed by the Hoover Reservoir which provides drinking water to the City of Columbus. The reservoir was constructed by damming Big Walnut Creek between Smothers Road and Central College Road and flooding the surrounding low lands. Construction began in 1953. While a dedication was held in 1955, the official opening did not occur until 1958. Numerous roads were re-routed or severed in order to construct the reservoir, including; Maxtown Road, Sunbury Road, Big Walnut Road, Oxbow Road, and Yankee Street. While swimming within the reservoir is prohibited, recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and sailing are permitted with public landings and fishing areas provided at several locations around the perimeter of the reservoir. Geography Located in the southeastern part of Delaware County, Genoa Township is part of the central Ohio region which is anchored by Columbus. The commute from Genoa Township to the job and entertainment center of downtown Columbus is less than twenty miles. Nearby shopping destinations Polaris Fashion Place (<5 miles), Tanger Outlet Mall (<8 miles), and Easton Town Center (<10 miles) are easily accessible from Genoa Township. Genoa Township borders the following townships and city: *City of Westerville - southwest *The City of Columbus owns the land encompassing Hoover Reservoir within Genoa Township preserving open space at Hoover Meadows and Mud Hen Marsh. *Orange Township - west *Berkshire Township - north *Harlem Township - east *Plain Township, Franklin County - southeast corner *Trenton Township - northeast corner *Blendon Township, Franklin County - south *Berlin Township - northwest corner The Highland Lakes and Medallion golf course communities constitute a significant portion of the largely developed southern portion of the township. The northern half of Genoa Township is still generally rural, but beginning to be developed as well. Genoa Township is one of the fastest growing areas near Columbus. A majority of the southern portion of the Township from the Delaware County border with Franklin County northward to Maxtown Road were annexed by the City of Westerville decades ago. Demographics =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 23,090 people living in the township. The population density was . There were 8,046 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 89.3% White, 4.7% African American, 0.1% Native American, 3.7% Asian, 0.5% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.8% of the population. In 2016 the zip codes that encompass Genoa Township were ranked the number one and two \\"Millionaire Neighborhoods\\" by Columbus Business First. Again in 2019, Columbus Business First research showed Genoa Township zip code 43021 was ranked first in central Ohio as the \\"Wealthiest Zip Code\\" (ranked by median household income) and 43082 was ranked third. Government The Township is governed by a three-member Board of Trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it.

A Democrat, he was a multi-term member of the United States House of Representatives and the 30th Governor of Missouri. Early life Mary Elizabeth Bird Alexander Dockery, only child of Willis E. and Sarah Ellen Dockery, was born near Gallatin, Daviess County, Missouri.Christensen, Lawrence O., Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, 1999, pp.243‚Äì244 His father was a Methodist minister and one of the early settlers to the county. The young Dockery attended the local public schools and then studied for a brief time at Macon Academy in (Macon, Missouri) before attending the St. Louis Medical College (now Washington University School of Medicine), graduating on March 2, 1865. Dockery established a medical practice in Linneus, Missouri and attended post-graduate lectures at Bellevue College (New York City) and Jefferson Medical College (Philadelphia) during the winter of 1865‚Äì1866. He returned to his practice in Linneus for a time before moving to Chillicothe, Missouri. While in practice in Chillicothe, he met and married Mary Elizabeth Bird in 1869. Dockery served as county physician for Livingston County, Missouri, from 1870 to 1874. He also made his first tentative step into politics by serving as president of the Chillicothe board of education from 1871 to 1873. In 1872 Dockery began a ten-year period as a member of the Board of Curators of the University of Missouri. In March 1874 Dr. Dockery ended his medical practice and returned to his native Gallatin to start a career in banking. He had originally intended to establish a bank in Milan, Missouri, but a Chillicothe friend and business associate, Thomas Yates, urged him to go into partnership with him in Gallatin instead. Dr. Dockery served as cashier and treasurer of the Farmers Exchange Bank, developing money management skills that would later prove useful in his political career both in the U.S. House of Representatives and as Missouri governor. Politics Alexander Dockery was a member of the Gallatin City Council beginning in 1878, and served as town mayor from 1881 to 1883. Pursuing a more active role in Democratic politics, Dockery was chairman of the congressional committee of his district In 1882 this led to him running for U.S. Congress. In November of that year he defeated incumbent Representative Joseph H. Burrows (Greenback Party) and Republican James H. Thomas with 52.9 percent of the vote to win a seat he would hold for the next sixteen years. =U.S. House= Congressman Dockery developed a reputation as a staunch fiscal conservative in the House, earning the sobriquet \\"Watchdog of the Treasury\\" during his ten years on the House Appropriations Committee, once stating \\"Unnecessary taxation leads to surplus revenue, surplus revenue begets extravagance, and extravagance sooner or later is surely followed by corruption.\\" Drawing on his banking experience, he played a key role in the Treasury Departments modification and updating of its accounting practices. Dockery also served as Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office where he brought about more fiscal responsibility and urged changes that improved mail delivery, especially in rural areas. He was an ardent supporter of Rural Free Delivery and its implementation in the 1890s. Dockery also fought against high tariffs, feeling it hurt farm exports. Among the important issues he would vote on in his time in Congress were the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, the Hatch Act, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After serving eight terms in Congress Dockery chose not to run for reelection in 1898. Finishing out his term in March 1899 he returned to Gallatin and began preparations for his next political goal, that of Missouri governor. =Governorship= The Missouri Gubernatorial election of November 1900 saw Alexander Dockery defeat Republican Joseph Flory and a divided field of four other candidates to win a narrow 51-percent victory. As Governor Dockery worked for increasing education funding and establishment of school districting across the state. Other highlights included election reforms and a franchise tax law was passed. Through increased revenue and changes in fiscal management techniques, a Dockery hallmark, during his administration the state's bonded indebtedness was paid off. Dockery was responsible for a \\"Missouri first\\" on March 23, 1903, when he signed the first state legislation licensing automobiles. The law required drivers to ring a bell or sound a horn or whistle before passing any horse-drawn machinery or vehicles. It also set a first-in-the-nation statewide speed limit of nine miles per hour. As governor, Alexander Dockery served as host to many world and national dignitaries during the 1904 St. Louis Worlds Fair. Prohibited by the Missouri constitution from a second term as governor, Dockery left office in early January 1905 replaced by fellow Democrat Joseph W. Folk, a man he strongly disagreed with. Folk was a political reformer from St. Louis who crusaded against patronage and cronyism, the status quo in turn-of-the-20th- century Missouri politics. Questioning Folk's party loyalty, Dockery lobbied hard against him. Folk in return charged that the Dockery had allowed Democratic machine politics to intimidate voters in the Democratic primary voting. Folk claimed that Dockery was either too incompetent to control the St. Louis police or was complicit in their inaction as Folk supporters were intimidated or physically attacked at St. Louis polling places.Piott, Steven L., 'Holy Joe: Joseph W. Folk and the Missouri Idea, University of Missouri Press, 1997. pp 81‚Äì84 Rather than see the state's highest office go to a Republican, the Folk-Dockery feud was settled in a second \\"Missouri Compromise\\" at the state Democratic convention. With Dockery's tepid support, Folk and his reformers won, marking a sea change in state politics as the \\"old guard\\" Democrats and their way of doing things began to fade. =Postal Service= Now a widower following the 1903 death of his wife, Alexander Dockery returned to Gallatin prepared for a life of semi-retirement. He was active in local civic affairs, and found enjoyment in, of all things, road repair. It was not an uncommon sight around Daviess County's Union Township to find Dockery with a horse and wagon out patching potholes and fixing culverts. In spite of his earlier clash with Joseph Folk, Dockery remained active in state Democratic politics, serving as treasurer of the Democratic State Committee in 1912 and 1914. Dockery's retirement ended in 1913 when on a trip to see the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson the new President asked him to help manage and streamline the U.S. Postal Service. Appointed the position of third assistant Postmaster General, Dockery helped put the agency's fiscal house in order. He served in the role until March 31, 1921. Final years Alexander Dockery retired to Gallatin again for the final years of his life. His wife deceased and all of their children dying very young, Dockery directed his paternal feelings toward the children of the community as a whole. A very large donation of books and money by Dockery helped create the Gallatin High School library. He also donated a 13-acre tract of land for use as a park. For many years \\"Dockery Day\\", his birthday, was celebrated in the community with all the schoolchildren receiving free admission to the town theater that day, courtesy of the Governor. Alexander Monroe Dockery died December 26, 1926. He is buried in the Edgewood Cemetery in Chillicothe, Missouri.

Some of these networks have been upgraded to light rail standards, called Stadtbahn in German. Stra√üenbahn and Stadtbahn schemes are usually operated on the legal foundation of the BOStrab, the Tramways Act of Germany. Tramways served as the primary means of urban transport in Germany until the early 1960s when they were systematically replaced by buses. However, in the 1980s tramways began to reappear; experts spoke of the 'renaissance of the tramway'. In the 1990s tramways had again become a modern means of public transport. Popular notions of fashion have been used by scholars to explain this cycle of acceptance rejection and restoration. Tramways were a highly visible manifestation of commodity culture and People projected onto them not just travel destinations but more broadly there desires, ideas and beliefs.Barbara Schmucki, \\"Fashion and technological change: Tramways in Germany after 1945.\\" The Journal of Transport History 31.1 (2010): 1-24.  Stadtbahn  Tram in Munich Trams in Berlin The Stadtbahn is a concept dating back as far as the late 1940s, when city councils were considering Unterpflasterstra√üenbahn (lit. below-pavement tramways) as part of rebuilding the city centres devastated by World War II. Some cities, like Hanover, reserved extra wide medians in their city's ring roads, though in most cities these plans never made it past the planning stage. However, seeing the success of the Berlin and Hamburg U-Bahn systems, cities started considering such schemes again in the 1960s and 1970s. Munich and Nuremberg decided to fully abolish their trams and started constructing a full-scale U-Bahn system (although to date, neither of these has abolished their tram system and likely never will - both are in fact re-expanding their tram systems) whilst other cities, like Hanover or Stuttgart, went for a scheme of city centre tunnels and special right-of-way arrangements with the prospect of converting their tramway networks to a full-fledged U-Bahn over several decades. By the 1980s, however, virtually all cities had abolished these plans due to the high costs involved with converting the tramways, and the most common Stadtbahn systems now are a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban and peripheral areas, and a more U-Bahn like mode of operation, featuring tunnel stations, in the city centres. The Stadtbahn scheme is not to be confused with the S-Bahn, which commonly is a suburban railway operating under the Railways Act, while the Stadtbahn typically is an urban railway operating under the Tramways Act.

Articulated trams are tram cars that consist of several sections held together by flexible joints. Like articulated buses, they have an increased passenger capacity. These trams can be up to forty metres in length, while a regular tram has to be much shorter. = Articulated trams =  History  1926 prototype from Duisburg From 1918 on, a few prototypes were built in Germany, for example a trailer car for Dresden in 1918 and two tramcars with Jacobs bogies for Duisburg in 1926. However, interest for these cars was low and the concept of articulation fell into obscurity. It was only after World War II that articulated cars were manufactured again; the first, small series of GT4 Jacobs bogie cars was deployed for Stuttgart in 1953 by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. From 1956 on, D√ºsseldorfer Waggonfabrik (D√ºwag) manufactured large numbers of articulated tram cars for operators in Germany and abroad to replace old pre-war models. Starting in 1959, Maschinenfabrik Esslingen and Hansawaggon, the latter mainly in Bremen and in Munich, tried to get into the market with their Kurzgelenkwagen construction -- however, in West Germany their market share remained small compared to the Jacobs bogie cars made by D√ºwag. The Hansawaggon design was copied later by CKD Tatra, which manufactured large numbers of KT4D tram cars based on this design for use in the GDR. Apart from the larger series, small numbers of cars were rebuilt for operators with odd requirements, for example the Bremer Stra√üenbahn AG received a series of 3-axled and Augsburg bought several 5-axled cars. In the 1970s, the first urban railway cars were developed in the Federal territory. In some cases, tried and tested tram types were modified in such a way that they were also suitable for elevated platforms; While long-distance articulated wagons with a trajectory of curves were built for Frankfurt and Hanover, the Stuttgart tram was followed by the opposite route, although a number of Stuttgart lines were also used as a conventional tram. In their first versions, the new Stuttgart double-wagon consisted of two four-axle single-wagons without a transition, and their bogies were much further apart than with classic streetcar trucks. In the 1990s, high-pressure low-floor trains were developed. In part, considerable changes were noticeable after large numbers of units were already in use. Also some older articulated cars were improved after 1990 with a low-floor segment. In order to avoid problems with low-floor technology, there are also new designs that are not completely low-floor, such as the Flexity Swift, developed for Cologne since 1995, whose axle distribution with four wheels is firmly developed underneath a short middle segment from a conventional articulated carriage type of the Zurich tram, the middle segment of which, however, has an exterior door. A pioneer in the development of Regiotram is Karlsruhe. Since 2000, the low-floor technology have been increasingly improved. Since 2001, the market leader Bombardier has been producing eight-axle three-piece rather than six-axle single-axle engines. And as successor model of the ADtranz low floor tram, is the Flexity Berlin. Particularly long-range low-floor articulation trains are built for the Dresden transport companies. At a time when low-floor technology is already almost standard, on the other hand the railways as RegioTrams also use railways, tramway vehicles (increasingly known as tramway vehicles) have to fulfill contradictory requirements.  Kurzgelenkwagen  Kurzgelenkwagen is a German term for articulated cars that require exactly one bogie per carbody. Two different models of these have been deployed: = Type Stuttgart = GT4 in Stuttgart The GT4, developed by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in 1959 for the Stuttgart tramways' steep lines connects the two bogies with a girder. The car bodies support themselves by resting on their bogie and on the girder. It therefore is not possible to separate the vehicle's individual cars. 380 cars were built in total, of which 350 were delivered to Stuttgart. Further cars were in use in Freiburg im Breisgau, Reutlingen, Neunkirchen as well as Ulm and Augsburg (which bought them used from Stuttgart), after German reunification used GT4 vehicles were also used in Nordhausen, Halberstadt and Halle. = Type Bremen = BSAG cars The Hansawaggon GT4 cars, designed and built for Bremer Stra√üenbahn AG, rest on the individual carbody's bogie only. The joint is not supported, and sections can be added and removed in the workshop. Hansawaggon delivered articulated power cars and trailers to the tramways of Bremen and Bremerhaven, the Munich- based manufacturer Rathgeber bought these cars under licence for the Munich tramways. The Czechoslovakian company CKD Tatra developed the KT4D tram car based on the same joint and bogie concept and delivered it in large numbers to the GDR from 1976. These cars, used in East Berlin and a number of other cities, were only manufactured as power cars, however they can run as multiple units. This concept found another use in three- and four-part low floor trams built since 1989, however a special track layout is necessary for these trams, as they have the tendency to swerve in curves. MAN and Adtranz delivered these vehicles to Bremen, Berlin and Munich; D√ºwag built a series of 40 for Frankfurt am Main (Type R).

Background Athanasius was involved in the early Christian christological and trinitarian debates, and supported the position of the Council of Nicaea in opposition to that of Arius and his followers. In 328, Athanasius was elected as bishop or patriarch of Alexandria. Alexandria happened to be the city in which Arius was a priest. The situation was further complicated, as Athanasius had not yet reached the age of 30 - the minimum age for bishops in the church. After Athanasius succeeded to the see of Alexandria, the Arians had accused Athanasius of, among other things: immoral conduct, illegally taxing the Egyptian people, supporting rebels to the Imperial throne, and even murdering a bishop and keeping his severed hand for use in magical rites. More to the point, Constantine had decided that he wanted Athanasius to re-admit Arius to the church‚Äîwhich he would not do. In 334 Athanasius was summoned before a synod in Caesarea, which he did not attend. The Synod The emperor Constantine had ordered a Synod of bishops to be present at the consecration of the church which he had erected at Jerusalem (the precursor to the Holy Sepulchre). He directed that, as a secondary matter, they should on their way first assemble at Tyre, to examine charges that had been brought against Athanasius.Socrates Scholasticus, ‚ÄúThe Eccesiastical History, by Socrates Scholasticus,‚Äù in Socrates, Sozomenus: Church Histories, ed. Philip Schaff and Henry Wace, trans. A. C. Zenos, vol. 2, A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church, Second Series (New York: Christian Literature Company, 1890), p.30. The Emperor also sent a letter to Athanasius, making clear that if he did not attend voluntarily, he would be brought to the Synod forcibly. Eusebius of Caesarea played a major role in the council and, according to Epiphanius of Salamis, presided over the assembly.Philip Schaff and David Schley Schaff, History of the Christian Church, vol. 3 (New York: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1910), p.874. About 310 members attended. Athanasius appeared this time with 48 Egyptian bishops. The Synod condemned Athanasius, so he went to Constantinople and confronted the Emperor personally. Aftermath At a hearing in the presence of the Emperor, Athanasius was cleared of all charges except one: threatening to cut off the grain supply to Constantinople from Egypt. This one charge was enough for the Emperor to exile Athanasius to Trier, then part of the Gallic prefecture of Rome (in present-day Germany). Athanasius did not return from exile until the death of Constantine in 337. The Arianism of the Synod of Tyre was ultimately overturned by the Council of Constantinople.

The company was founded in 1973 by William Millard and was based in San Leandro, California. Their first product launch was the IMSAI 8080 in 1975. One of the company's subsidiaries was the ComputerLand. IMS stood for \\"Information Management Sciences\\". IMS Associates required all executives and key employees to take the EST Standard Training. Forbes considered Millard's requirements - which placed a heavy emphasis on self-actualization and encouraged vast discrepancies between executives and staff - were a key contributor to the downfall of the company, and Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine concurred in Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer, noting that Millard's EST-induced unwillingness to admit a task might be impossible was a key factor in IMSAI's demise. History =Consultancy= In May 1972, William Millard began business individually as IMS Associates (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. The work done by IMS was similar to that Millard had done previously for the city and county of San Francisco. By 1973, Millard founded IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software. IMS provided advanced engineering and software management to mainframe users, including business and the United States Government. \\"Hypercube II will sell for about $80,000.\\" \\"IMS marketing director William Millard says military and government agencies have already expressed great interest in Hypercube\\" \\"Called the IMSAI 108, the system can handle 54 megabytes of data with a single spindle or, according to IMS director of marketing William H. Millard, it could be expanded to handle up to 16 drives-864 megabytes-'without any trouble at all.'\\" \\"The single-spindle model costs $29,500, and a dual-spindle (108 megabytes) model is priced at$47,500.\\" =IMSAI 8080= The IMSAI 8080. In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a \\"workstation system\\" that could complete jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually, product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had been first introduced, the 8080 looked like a \\"real computer\\". Full-scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was put into action, and by October 1975 an ad was placed in Popular Electronics, receiving positive reactions. Advertisement: IMSAI 8080 computer with 1K of RAM. $439 kit, $621 assembled. IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on 16 December 1975 and shortly after turned to fully assembled units. Between 17,000 and 20,000 units were eventually produced, with an additional 2500 produced under the Fischer-Freitas name thereafter. =Transition= In 1976, as IMS had completed its transition from a consultancy firm into a manufacturing firm, the name of the company was changed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation. =ComputerLand= The release of the Z80 by Zilog in 1976 quickly put an end to the dominance of 8080 machines as the new chip had an improved instruction set, could be clocked at faster speeds, and had on-chip DRAM refresh. IMSAI sales quickly plummeted and so in 1977 Millard decided to take the company through another transition, this time from a computer manufacturing company to a computer retailer. He established a chain of franchised retail outlets, initially called Computer Shack (the name was changed to ComputerLand following legal threats from Radio Shack). ComputerLand retailed not only IMSAI 8080s, but also computers from companies including Apple, North Star, and Cromemco. The 8080 sold poorly in comparison, and IMSAI developed the IMSAI VDP-80, an all-in-one computer which worked poorly. Many franchise dealers refused to retail most IMSAI products except those that retained popularity including the IMSAI 8080. With most of the IMSAI resources stripped to fund ComputerLand's expansion, and with Millard's attention diverted, IMS Associates, Inc. went into a \\"tailspin\\", and filed for bankruptcy in October 1979. The trademark was eventually acquired by Thomas \\"Todd\\" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees who undertook continued support after the parent company folded), now doing business as Fischer-Freitas Company (since October 1978), who continued manufacturing and service support under their newly acquired and trademarked IMSAI badge (such as the IMSAI Series Two), and continue support to this day. ComputerLand stores continued to prosper retailing IBM computers until IBM abandoned the 8-bit ISA bus in 1984; the franchises became independent following a series of bitter and costly legal battles with Millard.

The club competes in the Shute Shield competition run by the New South Wales Rugby Union. The club has produced 42 Wallaby representatives. The club's home ground is the historic North Sydney Oval on the North Shore of Sydney. The ground has been a venue for both codes of rugby and for cricket over more than a century. Club information :Club Name: Northern Suburbs Rugby Football Club :Nickname: The Shoremen, Norths, The Red and Blacks :Founded: 1900 :Home stadium: North Sydney Oval :Head coach: Nick Hensley :Captain: Hugh Sinclair :Vice Captain: Angus Sinclair :Uniform colors: Red & Black :Premiership Titles: 7 (1933, 1935, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1975, 2016) Club history = Pre World War One= Rugby on the lower North Shore is over 130 years old. Council minutes reveal that the North Shore Football Club played on a paddock adjoining Holterman's Tower, the present location of Shore School. The club later transferred to St Leonard's Park and became known as the Pirates, a team which won the First Grade Premiership in 1898 and the R.A.S. Trophy in 1897/8/9, defeating the neighbouring Wallaroos 10-nil in the third final. The Pirates and Wallaroos combined in 1900 to form North Sydney. It was the first district club to affiliate with the metropolitan Rugby Union in the initial eight-club district competition. The date was 5 April, ahead of Wests on 11 April and Easts on 12 April. Jim Henderson, commemorated in the present premiership trophies for third and fourth grades, was North's first secretary, and the club's first cap was winger Charlie White, who played in the first- ever test-match in 1899 against the British Isles and then in the first Australia v New Zealand test in 1903. The club did not win any premierships prior to the 1914‚Äì18 war, but before competitions were suspended, its name was changed to Northern Suburbs. However, for reasons today unknown, the new name was not implemented until the 1928 season. Under the guidance of one-eyed (lost in action in France) Fred Aarons, Norths played a leading role in the resurgence of rugby in Sydney during the 1920s. The reserve grade won the club's first premiership in 1925 and, in 1929, Norths won the initial Club Championship. The year 1928 saw a young recruit arrive, one Gavin John Andrews, who is now enshrined as the club's greatest treasure, Bon Andrews, after whom North Sydney No. 2 Oval is named. The first of North's two 'golden eras' occurred in the early 1930s. The club's initial first-grade premiership was in 1933, beating Manly 8‚Äì6, and again beating Manly in 1935 by 22‚Äì5. A member of the 1933 team, Jim Young, recently attended the club's tribute to our World Cup representatives, and was presented with a photo of his old team. The inaugural fourth-grade competition in 1932, back-to-back Club Championships in 1934 and 1935 and seven other minor grade premierships, highlighted the first half of the decade. Australian caps in the 1930s were 'Big' Tom Perrin, Waratah Sid King, ex-Kiwi Bill Hemingway, dual international Wal Mackney (stroke of the rowing eight at the Berlin Olympic Games, half Mike Gibbons and Eric Hutchinson who, with brother Frank, was killed while serving in World War II. =Post World War One= The Red and Blacks took some time to get back on top after the war, winning only the Third Grade Premiership in 1947, the Fourths a year later and nothing in the fifties. In 1947 Roger Cornforth played the first of his two Tests against the All Blacks. Controversially omitted from the 1947‚Äì48 Wallabies to the British Isles, this then allowed him to represent Australia at the 1948 Olympics in London at water polo. He also played against the 1950 British Lions. Peter Rothwell, Jim Cross and John Carroll added their names to North's honour roll in the 1950s and by 1960 John Thornett and Rod Phelps had joined Norths to improve its fortunes when once again defeating Manly, 21‚Äì3, Norths won its third First Grade Premiership and fourth Club Championship and its second Golden Era was ushered in. Three years later, the Red and Blacks beat Sydney University back- to-back for the 1963 and '64 First Grade Premierships, together with the Club Championship for those years. In 1964 Norths won three out of the four grade premierships, a rare feat until Randwick's run in the 1980s. In all, eight premierships were won in the 1960s and three Club Championships. From the Thornett and Phelps days, Roy Prosser (for several years Australia's most capped prop), Les Austin, Andy Town, John 'Sparrow' Dowse, Hugh Rose, Reg Smith, Garrick Fay, Peter Carson and Andy Stewart kept Norths alive in the test arena. Others, including Peter Johnston, Keith Henry, playwright and actor Warwick Moss, Peter Medway, Dennis Turnbull, Graeme Ewens, five-eight Jim Allen, Wallaby David Codey who played his Colts Rugby at Norths and ex- Rugby Club president, Russ Tulloch, played for the State. Russ also toured to Great Britain with the Wallabies. There was also the Westralian-Kiwi Bob Thompson. The club won eight premierships during the 1970s including First Grade in 1975. Norths also toured Singapore and Malaysia in 1970 (7 games), England and Wales in 1973 (7 games), USA West Coast in 1976 (6 games) and England, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1977 (8 games). By 1981 when, unhappily relegated to Second Division, Norths stood fourth on the list of premierships won in all senior grades in the First Division. There was no doubt that Norths were unlucky to be relegated in 1981. Even though the club went down, it still won the Fourth Grade Premiership. The criterion then was based on the First Grade team and Norths had a disastrous year, scoring only four wins and a draw. Norths were relegated with Hornsby, despite being just one point behind Sydney University and, in the club championship, was actually ahead of Warringah, Sydney Uni, St George and Hornsby. Norths went on to win the Sydney Rugby Union (second Division) Club Championship in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Finally, after winning it again in 1989, Norths won promotion back into First Division. However, also during this period the Club undertook two overseas tours. In 1984 there were 6 games against teams in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The club returned to Europe at the end of the 1988, with fixtures in England, France, Belgium and Italy. Some described it as an arduous four-week tour. In the eight years out of Sydney's top division through the 1980s, Norths won 12 premierships including three in first grade as well as four club championships. In addition to those grade rugby successes, a tremendous effort was made to develop the Colts and 12 premierships were won in various grades, which formed a sound basis for the return to First Division. =1990s= In its first year back, 1990, Norths finished eighth out of 11. In 1991 North's fourth-grade players were semi- finalists and its second-grade Colts were premiers ‚Äîa first-ever senior Colts win. The season also saw North's first addition to its Australian honours list since 1979‚ÄîRichard Tombs was selected in the victorious Wallaby World Cup squad. But he had to wait until 1992 to play his first two tests, against Scotland, at home. The 1993 season saw seven teams reach the semis, with Reserve Grade and Colts Seconds and Thirds winning premierships. There was also an overseas tour to the US, playing games in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York. 1994 saw the merger of North's two clubs (licensed and rugby). The Alfred Street properties were disposed of. The club purchased and moved to Christie Street, St Leonards location. Third and Fourth Grade won premierships that year, as did the Second Grade Colts. Richard Tombs won the inaugural Sydney Morning Herald 'Rugby Player of the Year Award' in 1995, with Nick Harvey being the youngest winner of the AAMI Medal. Fifth Grade won a premiership, and the club toured France, Belgium, Germany and UK at the end of the season. 1996 saw the beginning of professional rugby. Sixth Grade won the Premiership which was the final year that grade was run in the premier competition. In 1997 the Club lost its Patron and Honorary Life Member, George Marshall. The same year, members voted to change the club's accounting year to close on 30 June annually. 1997 also saw the arrival of Dennis Brown of New Zealand as head coach attracting such players as the 'bushwackers' dean et al. Plus a contingent of northern hemisphere players such as Fintan 'clinton napkin' Godkin, Linus 'why was I invited to the 1st grade trail' Mortlock the party even included Welsh legends Barry John and Carwyn James. Due to the high standard of these players and the reputation of Norths hospitality more followed in Scotsman David McComisky and Andrew 'Action' Jackson. The boys all left with fond memories of Norths and the 5th grade kit was a little lighter that year after they left! But was easily replaced due to the extraordinary bar profits established that year. The 1998 season proved to be the best since 1975 with a string of notable statistics. These included all five grade teams in the Grand Final, winning Second and Fifth Grade premierships. Norths won The Herald Club of the Year Award, and Michael Sykes the Club Player of the Year. Keith Gleeson won the Ken Catchpole Medal (Best & Fairest) in 1999, and at season's end a Club team toured Spain and Portugal. The 90's saw quite a number of players achieving representative honours. Jim Allen, Dominic Vaughan, Mick Kearins, Rod (Rambo) Clark, Sam Domoni, Richard Tombs, Mark Bell, Nick Harvey, Darren Junee, Keith Gleeson and Graeme Bond all played for the N.S.W Waratahs with Bond also playing at the ACT Brumbies in 1999 with Troy Jacques and former 1991 N.S.W Waratah Craig Wells. The representative careers of Ben Darwin and Al Baxter also began to emerge. =2000s= The year 2000 saw Northern Suburbs celebrate 100 years with the Norths Centenary Dinner, a black-tie affair at the Wentworth Hotel with over 300 people in attendance. The 2001 rugby highlight was obviously the success of the first- grade team securing the minor premiership for the first time since 1960. The season also saw the Wallaby debuts of Ben Darwin and Graeme Bond, with Al Baxter and Francis Cullimore gaining Super 12 contracts. During the year the Bon Andrews Bequest was established with the $25,000 he left to the club. This money is used to provide educational assistance to talented young players. During the year Vince Arena created a little more history for the club by playing his 300th match for Norths, and on retirement is second only to Bon Andrews in club games. Fifth Grade won the John Thornett Cup in 2002, and First Grade Colts made it to the grand final for the first time since 1977. Milton Thaiday and Lachlan McKay were offered Super 12 contracts, and First Grade finished second in the Shute Shield, and sixth in the inaugural Tooheys New Cup. In 2003 the season kicked off for some with a tour to Japan. First Grade finished fourth in the Tooheys New Cup, and captain Mark Challender achieved the SMH's ÀúClub Player of the Year' award. Kevin Horan was voted ÀúClub Coach of the Year'. All four Colts teams qualified for the semis, with First and Fourths losing narrowly in both grand finals. In the Rugby World Cup, Ben Darwin and Al Baxter played for the Wallabies (Al having made his debut earlier in the season against the All Blacks), and Tonga Lea'aetoa and Sai Latu represented Tonga. And Keith Gleeson played for Ireland. Early 2005 saw Northern Suburbs' club house undergo extensive renovations to reopen in June as Cabana Bar and Lounge. Cabana Bar has since cemented itself as a central venue to Sydney's north shore night life and a strong financial building block for the club. 2008 was a year of mixed emotions for the club. The colts teams had a disappointing year with some upheaval in the coaching staff and a reduction in player numbers compared to the year before. In hand with the reduction in young blood entering the club, Northern Suburbs were sad to see the passing away of one of their greatest treasures from the 1960s and 70s in Vale Roy Prosser. Roy still holds the club record for the highest number of First Grade games at 220. The Grand Final for 2008 saw Second Grade come from fifth on the table to claim the Premiership after being Runners Up the year before. The Second Grade Coaches Tony Horan and Grahame O'Donnell received a further reward in being promoted to coaching First Grade for the 2009 season. 2010 saw Norths, Waratahs and Wallabies front rower Al Baxter become the most capped New South Wales front rower when he received his 100th cap in the Super 14. An end of season tour to the United States of America was a success, playing New York Athletic Club, Gentleman of Aspen Rugby Club and Las Vegas Blackjacks. =2010s and onwards= In 2012 Norths 4th grade team secured the Henderson Cup in beating Manly at Concord Oval 21‚Äì0. All grade teams featured in the finals with 5th grade runners up for the John Thornett cup against Sydney University (played under lights at Sydney University Oval no.1). 1st Colts played in the Grand Final at Forshaw Rugby Park. In 2015 Head Coach, Simon Cron was awarded Coach of the Year and Will Miller was runner up in the Ken Catchpole Medal. In 2016 Norths broke a 41-year drought to claim the highly elusive Shute Shield after defeating Sydney University 28‚Äì15 at North Sydney Oval. Pandemonium ensued after Norths scored late in the Grand Final with thousands of fans flooding the field in celebration. Captain Will Miller was awarded the Ken Catchpole Medal in addition to Player of the Finals Series honours. Breakout centre Irae Simone was awarded Shute Shield Rookie of the Year for his performances over the course of the season, he then went on and starred in the now Sydney Rays NRC campaign, falling short in the semi- finals and was awarded a contract with NSW Waratahs. Norths' Colts 1 side also made their respective final, ironically, going down to Sydney University at Forshaw Rugby Park.

He is currently signed to Lucha Libre AAA as a Spanish commentator. He is best known as part of the Spanish language commentary team for the professional wrestling promotion WWE from 1994 to 2011. His great-great grandfather ‚ÄúEsteban‚Äù Savinovic Kobacisa emigrated from Dubrovnik, Croatia in the 1880s.  Early life  Savinovich moved from Ecuador with he's family to the Bronx, New York. Has wrestled for many years, performing in many Caribbean countries like Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. He claims that becoming a professional wrestler literally saved his life, as he was originally a gang member in the streets of New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He joined the sport under the guidance of Angel \\"El Toro\\" Maldonado. Mexican wrestling promoter Arturo Mendoza took him to Puerto Rico, where he lived for close to 14 years.  Professional wrestling career  Savinovich began his wrestling career in working for promoter Angel \\"El Toro\\" Maldonado in New York as the masked La Pantera Asesina. Later worked for Arturo Mendoza who ran wrestling shows in the west area of Puerto Rico. Moved on to the World Wrestling Council in 1978. He was originally a \\"tecnico\\" (the Spanish wrestling term for a \\"face\\", or \\"good guy\\"); after breaking up with Mendoza and his original wrestling partner, Little Chief Cherokee, he joined the local World Wrestling Council franchise in Puerto Rico, Capitol Sport Promotions (owned partially by Carlos Col√≥n), where he gained notoriety for being one of the \\"rudo\\" wrestlers (i.e., \\"heels\\", or wrestling villains), with a penchant for flamboyancy and self-promotion that gained him his most famous ring name, \\"El Mu√±ecazo\\" (\\"The Big Baby Doll\\"). Savinovich is on record as stating that he modeled his role after Gorgeous George, although his looks were particular to him and him alone (long hair with a mullet and David Letterman-like gaped teeth). He did promote his wrestlers using a high-pitched voice and fast delivery resembling that of drag racing radio advertisements in the United States. This also gave him the chance to develop his skills as a color commentator for wrestling matches, using a loud and fast narrative style -which he pioneered, since called \\"estilo lucha libre\\" (\\"wrestling style\\") in Puerto Rico. He would tour the United States for Western States Sports and Mid-South Wrestling in 1980 and Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1984. Hugo managed some the most notorious heels in professional wrestling such as Abdullah the Butcher, Ox Baker, The Sheik and Buddy Landell until he had a fallout with Barrabas Sr becoming a face in 1984. Savinovich eventually became a partner at World Wrestling Council, only to split with Col√≥n a few years after in a rather acrimonious business disputes with the company management forced him to leave and joined the rival American Wrestling Federation. In 1991, Savinovich would come out of retirement after seven years and feud with Billy Joe Travis, which would last a couple years in WWC and AWF. During his wrestler run, he wrestled names like Bret ‚ÄúThe Hitman‚Äù Hart, Eric Embry and his biggest rival, El Profe. He even made team with Kane on IWA-Puerto Rico.  Sports Commentary and Reporter  While working or Arturo Mendoza noticed that Savinovich had very good skills to be a wrestling announcer. Savinovich later became an announcer in the World Wrestling Council when he replaced Rickyn S√°nchez when S√°nchez left WWC in the fall of 1984. He remained there until November 1991 when he joined the American Wrestling Federation who ran opposition against the World Wrestling Council. In 1994, Savinovich accepted an offer from the World Wrestling Federation to work as a Spanish announcer. He was paired with Carlos Cabrera to host the Spanish language versions of Raw, SmackDown, Superstars, NXT, and pay-per-view (PPV) events. Savinovich and Cabrera had a show at WWE.com called WWE En Espa√±ol (WWE in Spanish), which lasts about 30 minutes; it is a recap of Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and pay-per-view events. The show celebrated its 100th episode in April 2006. Currently, WWE launched a mini show starring Hugo and Carlos called 28 Segundos, which consists of the announcers making fun of life. The show is in Spanish and can be found on WWE.com. In previous years, while working for WWE on their pay per views, the area in which he works with Cabrera, commonly known as the Spanish announcers' table, has become a staple in professional wrestling. It is a convenient device for wrestlers to execute dramatic moves on, such as the Piledriver or the Pedigree. The moves almost always result in the destruction of the table. One of the most famous on-air incidents that Savinovich was involved in with WWE was at WrestleMania XIX, when he accidentally received a chair shot to the head from Hulk Hogan in the match between Hogan and Vince McMahon after McMahon ducked a chair shot. He was unable to continue with the Spanish broadcast and Cabrera had to finish the show by himself. Savinovich and Cabrera provide live Spanish commentary for all weekly shows from the WWE Television Studios in Stamford, Connecticut and are at ringside for PPV events. This practice temporarily ended in mid-2006. Originally due to the addition of the now-defunct ECW brand, the announce teams of all three brands were present for tri-branded pay-per-views (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series). During this time, Savinovich and Cabrera provided commentary for these events from the WWE Television Studios but were still placed at ringside for brand-exclusive PPV events. When the brand- exclusive pay-per-view concept ended in 2007, the announce teams of all three brands were placed at ringside for all PPV events. Beginning in 2009, a single three-man announce team, composed of announcers from the two current brands, was designated for pay-per-views. Savinovich and Cabrera returned to ringside for PPVs at The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania in 2009. However, they were not reinstated full-time until WrestleMania XXVI in 2010. Also in 2009 Hugo Savinovich returned to the World Wrestling Council after a 17 years absence and the 2009 WWC Anniversary Card was dedicated to him. Savinovich was fired from WWE on October 5, 2011, although he only announced his dismissal on October 19 of that year. The details of his dismissal are not entirely clear, but different versions indicate that he did not come out on good terms with WWE. Savinovich was a guest commentator at the AAA Triplemania XXI. Also at that event, Savinovich was in El Mesias' corner in a match against Blue Demon Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship. During the inaugural season of Lucha Underground in 2014, there were two versions of the commentary shot, an English version with Matt Stryker and Vampiro, and a Spanish version that was broadcast on Unimas, with Savinivoch doing the play by play. Vampiro did the color commentary for the Spanish version also. In resent years Hugo Savinovich has been announcing for AAA in Mexico and promoting pro wrestling in Florida and throughout South America and Puerto Rico.Lucha Underground In early January 2019, it was reported that Savinovich had signed with All Elite Wrestling as a Spanish commentator. He worked the events Double or Nothing and All Out along with Alex Abranthes and Dasha Gonzalez. On March 16, 2019 at the Rey de Reyes event during a segment, Cody appointed Savinovich as a commentator for All Elite Wrestling (recently allied with AAA) sometime that he accepted. He participated in two PPVs in Spanish, however, due to contractual problems with AAA and other internal issues at AEW, he was not hired again. Hugo Savinovich currently works for Lucha Libre Triple A in Mexico as a Spanish Commentator. He also works for GWE in Panam√° as a commentator and executive producer. Hugo has hired by wrestling promoter Darko Navarro to be the face of the pro wrestling company Wrestling Superstar along with Navarro in Chile. The company was created in 2015 and his last event was in 2018, after Navarro losses money due to low ticket sales. Savinovich also works for WAR in Ecuador, and for NGCW in Florida as a Producer, Commentator and Main Booker. We also worked for Imperio Lucha Libre in Per√∫, a company that performed shows in Peru in 2018 and that was closed due to its low ticket sales. Hugo is currently a pro wrestling reporter in the spanish speaking community. He is part of Lucha Libre Online, along with Javier Gonz√°lez and Michael Morales Torres. His work of reporting has been quoted by sources like Forbes, New York Post, among others, but not for his good work. He works live reports after WWE, AEW, Impact Wrestling and AAA‚Äôs events on their Facebook Page. Hugo acts as an analyst of the latest wrestling events, while giving his point of view. A project that has been quite criticized by the all the wrestling community on the Internet due to its sensationalism in its news reporting and opinions, as well as due to the use of clickbait. In July 2020, he was involved in a controversy because through Superluchas.com, Jerry McDevitt, WWE's main lawyer, denied his version that the WWE Superstars had been kidnapped in Saudi Arabia in November 2019. Personal life He was once married to former female wrestler Wendi Richter until divorcing. In 1990 he married Diana Mend√©z and has two sons: Jovannie and Genaro. Diana Mend√©z died on November 1, 2019 after a long battle with cancer. He is a born again Christian and travels most of South and Central America sharing his Christian testimony. Hugo is the author of his own autobiography book, At√°ngana Ring de Tentaciones. He has announced that will be publishing a second book on 2024.

This P2Y receptor family has several receptor subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various adenosine and uridine nucleotides. The P2Y12 receptor is involved in platelet aggregation and is thus a biological target for the treatment of thromboembolisms and other clotting disorders. Two transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been identified for this gene. In the field of purinergic signaling, the P2Y12 protein on the periphery is found mainly but not exclusively on the surface of blood platelets, and is an important regulator in blood clotting. In the central nervous system, this receptor has been found expressed exclusively on microglia, where it is necessary for physiological and pathological microglial actions, such as monitoring neuronal functions and microglial neuroprotection.  P2Y12 inhibitors  The drugs clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Efient, Effient), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and cangrelor (Kengreal) bind to this receptor and are marketed as antiplatelet agents. = For acute coronary syndrome = The combination of P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin, which called dual antiplatelet treatment, remains the first line treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Recent suggested prasugrel is superior than ticagrelor. = Antiplatelet treatment of STEMI = In patients undergoing primary PCI for an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), US, European, and Canadian guidelines recommend that a P2Y12 inhibitor should be administered as soon as possible, although it is unclear whether administration of these medications before the patient arrives at the hospital confers additional benefits compared with in-hospital administration. On the other hand, P2Y12 inhibitors do not change the risk of death when given as a pretreatment prior to routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in people who have had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Though, a P2Y12 inhibitor in addition to aspirin should be administered for up to 12 months to most patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. They do however increase the risk of bleeding and decrease the risk of further cardiovascular problems. Thus their routine use in this context is of questionable value. A network meta-analysis of 37 studies involving 88,402 STEMI patients and 5,077 major adverse cardiac events (MACE) patients found that use of prasugrel was associated with lower mortality and MACE than other drugs in this class (clopidogrel and ticagrelor).

They are known commonly as cuckoo bees.Nomadinae. UniProt. This subfamily is entirely kleptoparasitic.Roig-Alsina, A. (1991). Cladistic analysis of the Nomadinae s. str. with description of a new genus (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae). Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society 64(1) 23-37. They occur worldwide, and use many different types of bees as hosts. As parasites, they lack a pollen- carrying scopa, and are often extraordinarily wasp-like in appearance. All known species share the behavioral trait of females entering host nests when the host is absent, and inserting their eggs into the wall of the host cell; the larval parasite emerges later, after the cell has been closed by the host female, and kills the host larva. The first-instar larvae of nomadines are specially adapted for this, and possess long mandibles they use to kill the host larva, though these mandibles are lost as soon as the larva molts to the second instar, at which point it simply feeds on the pollen/nectar provisions. Another unusual behavioral habit seen in adults of various genera is they frequently \\"sleep\\" while grasping onto plant stems or leaves with only their mandibles.

Written and produced by Motown's main creative team, Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was the final Top 10 hit for the Vandellas in the United States, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967 and at number-one on the Billboard R&B; Singles chart. Billboard named the song #82 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.  History  The song, with a lead vocal by the Vandellas' lead singer Martha Reeves in the 1967 version, is sung from the point of view of a woman who longs for the return of boyfriend \\"Jimmy Mack\\". The woman is being courted by another suitor, who she says \\"talks just as sweet as\\" her long-gone Jimmy, and she hopes for Jimmy to return before she falls for the other man. The inspiration for the song came from a 1964 music industry awards dinner, which Lamont Dozier attended. At the ceremony the mother of songwriter Ronnie Mack accepted an award for her son, who had recently died, for his composition \\"He's So Fine\\". Under pressure to come up with a hit for Reeves and the Vandellas, Dozier and the team penned this song in part as a tribute to Mack the writer. \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was originally recorded in 1964 when Annette Beard was still a part of the group. The song was shelved because the Motown Quality Control team felt the recording was not suitable for release because it sounded too much like a Supremes song. Like Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' later hit, \\"The Tears of a Clown\\", \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was pulled from the vault two years later and released as a single in early 1967. By that time, the Vietnam War had become a highly debated issue among the American public. Thus, Reeves' sentiment that her \\"Jimmy Mack\\" return took on a different meaning for many listeners, particularly those stationed overseas. \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was a success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the second and final Vandellas single to top the Billboard R&B; chart. \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was also a hit in Britain reaching number 21. The song had been included on the Vandellas' LP Watchout!, issued a month before the single release. For nearly forty years, \\"Jimmy Mack\\" was presented in either monaural sound or in a mix culled from an alternate take. A true stereo mix of the original single master was not done until 2005, for The Motown Box, then appearing in 2006 on the compilation Martha & the Vandellas: Gold.

Original episodes of Clean Sweep aired on TLC in 2003 through 2005. In each episode of Clean Sweep, the host meets with the homeowners in the rooms to be cleaned. The production crew then moves the entire contents of the room outdoors. The host then assists the homeowners with an initial half-hour (more or less time in some episodes) sort of all the items into three areas: ‚Äúkeep‚Äù, ‚Äúsell‚Äù and ‚Äútoss‚Äù. The process is then repeated by the organizer, in a much more thorough manner. Meanwhile, the designer and carpenter renovate the rooms, usually painting the rooms and constructing storage units such as closets, entertainment units, or cabinets. On the second day, a yard sale is held to dispose of the items in the ‚Äúsell‚Äù category (unsold items are donated to an unspecified charity). The homeowners (usually a husband and wife) compete to sell the most, with the loser having to give up a sentimental item from the ‚Äúkeep‚Äù category (of their \\"opponents choice\\"). Once the rooms are renovated and the remaining items from the ‚Äúkeep‚Äù category moved back into the house, the homeowners are brought in to be surprised by the final results. In some episodes one of the items for sale items is the \\"mystery item\\" if either of the homeowners sells it. the couple wins a bonus prize. typically this was a dinner for two at an unspecified restaurant but in one episode the prize was a trip to Disneyland.

While legend suggests Spanish gold seekers may have explored the area in the late 16th century, Zeballos is now known for its ecotourism and sport fishing. Location and geography Zeballos is a deep-sea port surrounded by rugged mountains and forests, located on the Zeballos River delta, at the end of Zeballos Inlet within the territory of the Ehattesaht Chinehkint First Nation. It is accessible from Highway 19, about a two and half hour drive north of Campbell River. Zeballos' position relative to nearby Nootka Sound and Kyuquot Sound make it a popular \\"jump-off\\" point for tourists and anglers. Other areas of interest include Nootka Island, Fair Harbour, a 35 km (22 mi) trip by unpaved road from Zeballos, and Brooks Peninsula Provincial Park. History The eponymous inlet was named for Lt. Ciriaco Ceballos, a crew member aboard an early ship of Spanish explorer Alessandro Malaspina's expedition (1789-1794), the location of Zeballos remained relatively obscure until over 120 years later, when a mining camp by that name emerged due to a gold rush in the 1930s. The name became official as that of the local post office in 1946 and was incorporated as a village municipality in 1952.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Zeballos (village) Although estimates vary, Zeballos may have had a population of over 5,000 during the peak of mining activity. Between 1938 and 1943, $13 million worth of gold bricks were shipped from Zeballos.britishcolumbia.com page on Zeballos Zeballos harbour With the onset of World War II, Zeballos lost significant numbers of its workforce to the Canadian Army. Eventually, the mines began to close. Although post-war efforts were made to begin production again, the set price of $35.00 an ounce made it uneconomical for the mines to continue operating.Zeballos history page Within twenty years, the mines had closed for good. In the 1950s, logging emerged as a promising new industry for the village. In 1964, an iron mine was established. Although the timber industry proved successful for the community, the mine shut its doors just five years after opening. In 1964, the Good Friday earthquake and ensuing tsunami brought destruction to the small coastal community. Charles Ford, a young seaplane pilot and resident of Zeballos, wrote: On April 27, 2004, the body of young resident Kayla John was found in a wooded area close to her home. The murder made national headlines, shaking this tiny community of under two hundred and fifty people. Less than one month after her death, a local man, George Osmond, was charged with the death of the thirteen-year-old girl. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison shortly thereafter. The fact that Kayla John was a member of the Ehattesaht First Nation, and that her alleged killer was a white man, lead to suggestion of the crime having racial undertones. It also brought attention to the developing issue of juvenile delinquency in the area, a problem faced by many isolated, predominantly First Nations communities. The public's growing concern resulted in a locally organized policing initiative: Citizens on Patrol. Economy Today, the majority of the town's residents, along with the population of the two neighbouring Native reserves, Oculcje and Ehatis are employed in the timber industry. Small businesses, specializing in ecotourism, sight-seeing, commercial fishing and oyster farming also contribute to economic growth in the area.

Also called the Kaibab Plateau - North Rim Parkway, SR 67 is the sole road that links U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) at Jacob Lake to the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Along the route, the road heads through the national park as well as Kaibab National Forest and is surrounded by evergreen trees. The section inside the national park is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS), whereas the section north of the entrance, completely within Kaibab National Forest, is owned by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). The road was built in the late 1920s and improved through the 1930s. In 1941, the road received its number, and was given its designation as the parkway in the 1980s. The parkway has received designations as a National Forest Scenic Byway as well as a National Scenic Byway. Route description Signage for SR 67 begins at Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own this section of road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau - North Rim Parkway through the small town of North Rim, surrounded by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake. SR 67 at the Kaibab National Forest entrance The northern segment of the highway is maintained by ADOT, who is responsible for maintaining SR 67 like all other highways around the state. As part of this job, ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes. These surveys are most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around 1,100 vehicles used the route daily at its northern terminus in Jacob Lake. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) lists the highway as a National Scenic Byway, and the National Forest Service has also designated it a National Forest Service Byway. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Due to the closure of park facilities on the north rim of the Grand Canyon during winter, winter maintenance is not undertaken after December 1, with the result that SR 67 is usually closed to vehicular traffic from December 1 until spring. History SR 67 in Kaibab National Forest SR 67 existed as a route to reach the north rim of the Grand Canyon National Park as early as 1927 as a dirt road. By 1935, the road had been improved to a gravel road, and by 1938 it had been paved. In 1941, the road was designated as a state highway and signed as SR 67. In 1985, the highway received the designation of Kaibab Plateau - North Rim Parkway as an Arizona State Scenic Byway. The designation included SR 67 in its entirety as well as extending south into Grand Canyon National Park. Two years later, ADOT obtained the right-of-way for improvement of the highway from its northern terminus approximately south. In 1989, an additional right- of-way was acquired by ADOT from its southern terminus approximately north. By June of that year, the parkway received the designation of a National Forest Scenic Byway, and in June 1998, the Kaibab Plateau - North Rim Parkway received another designation, this time as a National Scenic Byway. Since establishment, the route has not been realigned and retains its original routing.

It is notable for several reasons: it is the first track to feature new member, Martha's younger sister Sandra \\"Lois\\" Reeves replacing just-fired Betty Kelley, it was the group's twelfth top 40 pop single, and it was also the last top 40 hit the group would score throughout the rest of their Motown tenure though they would score several top 40 R&B; singles before leaving the label in 1973. It was also the first single to be credited as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas after the label requested that some of the lead singers of several groups put their name in front of the group's to earn billing for both lead singer and group. Samples and Covers The song was covered by The Jackson 5 on their 1971 album Maybe Tomorrow.

The superior judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Federal Shariat Court and five High Courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. There is a High Court for each of the four provinces as well as a High Court for the Islamabad Capital Territory. The Constitution of Pakistan entrusts the superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend the constitution. Neither the Supreme Court nor a High Court may exercise jurisdiction in relation to Tribal Areas, except otherwise provided for. The disputed regions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan have separate court systems.Gilgit-Baltistan (Empowerment and Self-Governance) Order, 2009, Article 60 (Supreme Appellate Court) and Article 69 (Chief Court) Besides Supreme Court of Pakistan, there are areas that are not constitutional parts of Pakistan till now. They are Gilgit Baltistan and AJK. As per constitution of Pakistan, these both areas are not a part of Pakistan, rather they are being governed by Government of Pakistan on interim basis. Though Gilgit Baltistan declared its independence from Dogra/Maharaja Kashmir on 1 November 1948, that is said to be the independence day of Gilgit Baltistan. Likewise, the authority of Constitution of Pakistan is not held there, though through Presidential ordinances, and PM packages, they are governed and given an interim authority delegated by Federal Government of Pakistan. As the Supreme Court of Pakistan doesn't have jurisdiction over Gilgit Baltistan, thus another form of APEX Court named Supreme Appellate Court for Gilgit Baltistan has been introduced, with designated powers as that of Supreme Court of Pakistan. The subordinate judiciary consists of civil and criminal district courts, and numerous specialized courts covering banking, insurance, customs and excise, smuggling, drugs, terrorism, taxation, the environment, consumer protection, and corruption. The criminal courts were created under the Criminal Procedure Code 1898 and the civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Court Ordinance 1962. There are also revenue courts that operate under the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act 1967. The government may also set up administrative courts and tribunals for exercising exclusive jurisdiction in specific matters. As of 2017, Pakistan‚Äôs judiciary is suffering from a backlog of two million cases, with lawsuits taking an average of nearly ten years to resolve. According to some estimates, 90% of civil cases involve land disputes, owing to Pakistan‚Äôs lack of a proper land register. Superior judiciary  =Supreme Court of Pakistan= The Supreme Court (SCOP), established in 1956,Constitution of Pakistan (1956), Article 148 is the apex court in Pakistan's judicial hierarchy, the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes. The court consists of a Chief Justice and sixteen other judges. There is also provision for appointment of acting judges as well as ad hoc judges in the court. It has a permanent seat in Islamabad as well as branch registries in Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi. It has a number of de jure powers which are outlined in the constitution, including appellate and constitutional jurisdiction, and suo moto power to try human rights matters. Through several periods of military rule and constitutional suspensions, the court has also established itself as a de facto check on military power. The Supreme Court Judges are supervised by the Supreme Judicial Council. =Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan= The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan was established in 1980 to scrutinize all Pakistani laws and determine if they conform to Islamic values \\"as laid down in the Quran and the Sunnah\\". If a law is found to be 'repugnant', the Court notifies the relevant government, specifying the reasons for its decision. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over penalties (hudud) arising under Islamic law, although these decisions can be reviewed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court. The decisions of the court are binding on the high courts as well as the subordinate judiciary. The court appoints its own staff and frames its own rules of procedure. The court consists of eight Muslim judges, appointed by the President of Pakistan, on the advice of a judicial committee of the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the Federal Shariat Court. The committee chooses from amongst serving or retired judges of the Supreme Court or the high courts or from amongst persons possessing the qualifications of judges of a high court. Of the eight judges, three are required to be Islamic Scholars/Ulema well versed in Islamic law. The judges serve terms of three years, subject to extension by the President. The current Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court is Justice Sheikh Najam ul Hasan. =High courts= Lahore High Court There is a high court for the Islamabad Capital Territory and four provincial high courts. A high court is the principal court of its province. *Lahore High Court, Lahore, Punjab High Courts (Establishment) Order, 1970 (P.O. No. 8 of 1970), Article 3(1)(b) *Sindh High Court, Karachi, Sindh High Courts (Establishment) Order, 1970 (P.O. No. 8 of 1970), Article 3(1)(c); Baluchistan and Sind (High Courts) Order, 1976 (P.O.

The administrative head of district judiciary is the 'district and sessions judge'. In each district headquarters, there are a number of courts of additional district and sessions judges having same judicial powers like the court of district and sessions judge, including trial for offences shown in schedule II of Code of Criminal Procedure as exclusively triable by the Court of Session i.e. Qatl e Amd (culpable homicide), rape, defamation dacoity etc. These courts have also jurisdiction to try cases under the Hudood Laws of Pakistan, certain offences under Control of Narcotic Substances Act etc. These courts also work as ex officio Justice of Peace to entertain complaints against police officials. In civil jurisdiction these courts entertain the matters under Succession Act, Insolvency Act, suits for government, summary suits pertaining to negotiable instruments etc. These Courts are also civil appellate and criminal appellate courts. Civil and Family Appeals and Civil Revisions against the Judgements and orders of courts of senior civil judges, civil judges, rent controllers, and family courts are entertained by the court of district judge which transfers the same to additional district judges as well. All convictions awarded by judicial magistrates and convictions up to four years awarded by courts of assistant sessions judges or magistrates especially empowered under section 30 Cr.P.C. are appealable to a court of sessions judge which also transfer the criminal Appeals and criminal revisions to Additional Sessions Judges. *The high court of each province has appellate jurisdiction over the lower courts. *The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between and among provincial governments, and appellate jurisdiction over high court decisions. Court usually starts early in the morning, with the hearing of pre-arrest bail applications, followed by post-arrest bail applications and civil appeals from the orders of the judicial magistrates' courts and civil judges. Decisions are usually announced later in the day, once the judge has had time to peruse the case files after the hearings. The rest of the day is allocated for the recording of the evidence in sessions cases such as in offences murder, rape and robbery etc. Cases are usually allotted by administrative orders of district and sessions judges. The court of the district and sessions judge usually hears administrative applications against lower courts orders. = Civil judge cum judicial magistrates' courts= In every town and city, there are numerous civil and judicial magistrates' courts. Normally in capacity of judicial magistrate these courts have the powers to try all offences other than those which are specifically triable by Court of Session but maximum limit for awarding sentence of improvement is not more than three years. However a judicial magistrate having special powers under section 30 of Code of Criminal Procedure can award all punishments except capital punishment. In civil capacity in the province of Sindh and Balochistan as a civil judge these courts have jurisdiction to entertain the claims of third-class suits having a pecuniary limit up to fifty thousand rupees. In other provinces civil judges have jurisdiction to entertain first- and second-class suits. Judicial magistrates possesses territorial jurisdiction police station wise as per notification issued by the Court of Session Judge. In magisterial functions judicial magistrates record statements on oath of witness, Judicial confession of accused, holds identification test parades, inquest proceedings of the prisoners. This court takes first cognizance of all offences of local laws, disposes of unclaimed properties or the movable properties suspected to be stolen. =Special tribunals and boards= There are numerous special tribunals such as; *Banking courts *Criminal courts *Custom courts *Drug courts *Federal Services Tribunal *Provincial services tribunals (one for each province) *Income tax tribunals *Anti-corruption courts *Anti-terrorism courts *Labour courts *Labour Appellate Tribunal *Environmental courts *Board of Revenue *Special magistrate courts *Control of Narcotic Substances (special courts) *Consumer courts - *Intellectual Property Tribunal *Foreign Exchange Appellate Board Almost all judges of above-mentioned courts and tribunals except for consumer courts are district and sessions judges or of having same qualifications. Besides, there exist revenue courts, operating under the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act 1967. The revenue courts may be classified as the Board of Revenue, the Commissioner, the Collector, the Assistant Collector of the First Grade and Second Grade. The provincial government that exercise administrative control over them appoints such officers. Law prescribes their powers and functions. =Family courts= The West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 governs the jurisdiction of Family Courts. As per schedule in the Act of 1964 family courts entertains the disputes of dissolution of marriage, recovery of maintenance of wives and minors, dower, dowery articles, guardian and wards disputes ie custody of minors, recovery of bridal gifts etc. All final decisions are appealable before the court of district judge while interim orders are not appealable but are challenged before high court through the constitutional jurisdiction. =Juvenile courts= The parliament has passed the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018. The law is applicable to the whole of Pakistan. It has repealed the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000. rightSection 4 of the JJSO authorizes the Provincial Government to establish one or more juvenile courts for any local area within its jurisdiction, in consultation with the chief justice of the high court. Jurisdiction of juvenile courts was conferred to sessions judges and judicial magistrates in accordance with their original jurisdiction under Code of Criminal Procedure. Juvenile Justice System Act provides that every person below the age of 8 years is juvenile. The conclusive proof of age is Occification Test. The law warrants separate Camera trial of the juvenile providing all privileges to the juvenile accused as per the Act of 2018. Appointments of Judges =Supreme Court of Pakistan= Prior to 18th Constitutional Amendments, appointments to the Supreme Court of Pakistan were made by the President of Pakistan, on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This system bred many allegations of favoritism. Many judges who were appointed were relatives of other Judges or Government officials. However, following the Supreme Court's judgement in the Al-Jehad Trust case, the government's role in judicial appointments was curtailed. Under the terms of this judgement, the Government and the President's office were bound to act on the recommendations of the Chief Justice of Pakistan. After passage of the 18th and 19th Constitutional Amendments, a new Judicial Commission (named Judicial Commission of Pakistan) and Parliamentary Committee were established for appointments. The Judicial Commission of Pakistan consists of a total of nine members: the Chief Justice of Pakistan, four senior judges of the Supreme Court, a former Chief Justice or judge of the Supreme Court nominated by the serving Chief Justice in consultation with the four serving judges of the Supreme Court aforementioned, the Attorney General of Pakistan, the Federal Minister for Law and Justice and, one senior advocate nominated by the Pakistan Bar Council. The Parliamentary Committee confirms or may not confirm the nominee of the Judicial Commission. All power of executive was curtailed by the judicial commission and president has no discretionary power but only to approve the nominees. Prime minister has only ministerial power regarding the appointment procedure. =High Courts= In Appointments to the High Courts, the same procedure as in Supreme Courts appointments is adopted Prior to 18th Constitutional Amendment, High Court appointments suffered much the same criticisms as those to the Supreme Court. Future appointments will be made in the same manner as those to the Supreme Court. But instead of 4 supreme court judges, 4 most senior high court judges, provincial law minister and a member of provincial bar councils (such as Punjab Bar Council) will sit the Judicial Commission of Pakistan considering the appointment of high court judges. The age limit for the high court judge is minimum 45 years. There is no merit system for selection of Judges to higher Judiciary. Judges of the Judicial Service are generally ignored during the selection while influential Lawyers who have political support from Political Parties and Bars make it to the higher Judiciary. =District & Sessions Judges= Additional District & Sessions Judges are appointed by the Provincial & federal High Courts, from a pool of Lawyers and subordinate judges. To be eligible for appointment, Lawyers must have ten years' experience as an advocate with good standing in the respective jurisdiction. They must also pass an examination conducted by the High Courts. Subordinate judges are also promoted from senior civil judges on a seniority basis. =Civil Judge Cum Judicial Magistrate= Civil Judge Cum Judicial Magistrates are also appointed by the Provincial High Courts, on the recommendation of provincial Public Service Commissions. These Commissions hold open competitive exams annually, which are advertised in national newspapers. The basic qualifications required are an LL.B from any recognized university, and two years' experience as an advocate in the jurisdiction in question. The exams include various compulsory papers. For example, the Punjab Public Service Commission sets compulsory papers on English Language & Essay, Urdu Language & Essay, Islamic Studies, Pakistan Studies, General Knowledge (objective test), Criminal Law, Civil Law 1 & 2, and General Law. All candidates who pass the examinations are given a psychological test. Those who pass both these stages are interviewed by members of Service Commissions, and recommendations are made to the respective High Courts for appointments. In Sindh province, the appointments are made on the backdrop of a test conducted by National testing service (NTS) which is primarily based on English language and General knowledge. The candidates who manage to pass the first test then undertake another test by NTS after which the successful candidates are chosen for the interview which is conducted by the five most senior judges of high court including chief justice of Sindh and candidate who manage to pass the interview are recommended for the post of civil judge and judicial magistrate who thereafter are appointed by the government of Sindh.

It is the longest- running, premiere showcase for international documentaries in the United States, encompassing a broad spectrum of work, from indigenous community media to experimental nonfiction. The Festival is distinguished by its outstanding selection of titles, which tackle diverse and challenging subjects, representing a range of issues and perspectives, and by the forums for discussion with filmmakers and speakers. The Mead Festival has a distinguished history of ‚Äúfirsts,‚Äù including being the first venue to screen the now-classic documentary Paris Is Burning (1990) about the urban transgender community. Furthermore the Mead Festival has introduced New York audiences to such acclaimed films as the Oscar-winning documentary The Blood of Yingzhou District (2006), Oscar-winning animated short The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation (2005), The Future of Food (2004), Power Trip (2003), and Spellbound (2002). Background The festival owes its origins (and its name) to renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead, who worked for 52 years at the American Museum of Natural History. She acted as curator in the Museum's Department of Anthropology, where she helped create the Hall of Pacific Peoples, which bears her name. In her lifetime, Margaret Mead greatly advanced the academic standing and popular appeal of cultural anthropology, and was also one of the earliest anthropologists to integrate visual methods into her research, focus on the study of visual communication, and teach courses on culture and communication. \\"Pictures are held together,\\" Dr. Mead wrote, \\"by a way of looking that has grown out of anthropology, a science in which all peoples, however contrasted in physique and culture, are seen as members of the same species, engaged in solving problems common to humanity.\\" In 1976, in commemoration of her 75th birthday, the museum decided to pay tribute to her work with a film festival of top ethnographic and other documentary films. In its early years, the festival focused on ethnographic films and was hosted by the USC Center for Visual Anthropology (directed by Mead's student, the late filmmaker Tim Asch). Today, the Festival continues to exemplify Mead's teachings: that film is a tool for cross-cultural understanding and that it is possible, and important, for societies to learn from each other. Margaret Mead Filmmaker Award Margaret Mead Filmmaker Award recognizes documentary filmmakers who embody the spirit, energy, and innovation demonstrated by anthropologist Margaret Mead in her research, fieldwork, films, and writings. Each year the award is given to a filmmaker whose feature documentary offers a new perspective on a culture or community remote from the majority of our audiences' experience as well as displays artistic excellence and originality in storytelling technique. U.S., North American, or World Premiere documentaries (60 minutes or longer) are eligible for the Award. This award has a cash prize. * 2010 Winner: Marc Francis/Nick Francis for When China Met Africa * 2011 Winner: Yuanchen Liu for To the Light * 2012 Winner: Adam Isenberg for A Life Without Words Traveling Festival The Margaret Mead Traveling Film & Video Festival presents highlights of the Festival that takes place in November.

The album was scheduled for a September release but ultimately released November 14, 2000. After four Mobb Deep albums, Prodigy took a temporary break from the group and released his first solo effort. \\"H.N.I.C.\\" is an initialism for \\"Head Nigga In Charge\\". Prodigy enlisted a number of producers for the album, including The Alchemist, EZ Elpee, Rockwilder, Just Blaze and his Mobb Deep partner Havoc. Music videos were done for \\"Keep It Thoro\\" and \\"Y.B.E\\" (Young Black Entrepreneurs). The album received universal widespread critical acclaim. The song \\"Keep It Thoro\\" was released on vinyl. A sequel, H.N.I.C. Pt. 2 was released April 22, 2008. It features production by Havoc, a fellow member of Mobb Deep and The Alchemist among others. In 2011, after being released from prison, Prodigy began work on the third album in the series, H.N.I.C. 3. The album inspired rapper, Wiz Khalifa's album, O.N.I.F.C.. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 18, 2000. The album also inspired a 16-year old, Kendrick Lamar, who dropped his Y.H.N.I.C. project in 2003.  Background  While Prodigy was working on H.N.I.C. and the Murda Muzik album with Mobb Deep, he started living a healthy lifestyle. His verse on Quiet Storm explains this: \\"I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right wastin' my life, now I'm trying to make things right.\\" Although Quiet Storm appeared on Murda Muzik, it was originally planned for H.N.I.C. Prodigy addresses his lifelong pain with Sickle-cell disease on the track \\"You Can Never Feel My Pain\\". On this track he also explains that this disease makes him depressed, which made him crave for controlled substances and alcohol. The more conscious side of Prodigy is also visible on the song \\"Genesis\\". \\"The positive and negative war has now begun. P helps you both the sides let the truth arise, black devil don't hide You can't hide from me, you might from the others. I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers. You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to. Trickin my brothers into followin you? Yo, Potential energy is easily made kinetic.\\" This isn't an only conscious album though. Prodigy strikes again with hardcore lyrics. Prodigy can therefore be described as a conscious gangster. On the track H.N.I.C. Prodigy lets you know that he is the boss: \\"I be the H.N.I.C. The head nigga in charge. The boss, the Captain Crunch dog, the sarge. The M.O.B.B., the status - we large. The guns, the drama, the love, the Mobb.\\" The 6th track \\"Keep It Thoro\\" does not have a hook or chorus; this was the central idea of the song with Prodigy making this clear with the penultimate line \\"heavy airplay all day with no chorus\\". However, Prodigy's manager at the time, Chris Lighty, thought the song could do better on the radio with a chorus. This resulted in recording a version with a chorus by Havoc after the album was released, with the penultimate line edited out. The Alchemist, the producer of this track, later commented that \\"the hook was dope too but the song was already powerful enough.\\" This version of the song was included on the Japanese edition of the album as a bonus track. Prodigy's wife KiKi appears on the track \\"Trials of Love\\" as B.K. (aka) Mz. Bars, being the only time she appeared on a song. She made her video appearance in the Hey Luv video from Mobb Deep's Infamy (2001). The album appeared on \\"The 100 Best Albums of the 2000s\\" list by Complex magazine.

A United States Representative and Senator from Indiana, he also served in the court systems of Indiana and Kansas. Born in Sackets Harbor, New York, he completed preparatory studies and admitted to the bar in 1831. He moved to Lafayette, Indiana where he commenced practice in 1838; he was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives in 1838-1839 and was United States district attorney from 1839 to 1843. Pettit was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirtieth Congresses (March 4, 1843 - March 3, 1849); he was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1848. In 1850 he was a delegate to the Indiana state constitutional convention and a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket in 1852. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of James Whitcomb and served from January 18, 1853, to March 4, 1855; he was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1854. While in the Senate he was chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims (Thirty-third Congress). During the Senate debate on the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, Pettit argued in favor of expanding slavery to Kansas, and famously said that Jefferson's idea (in the United States Declaration of Independence) that \\"all men are created equal\\" was not a \\"self-evident truth\\" but instead \\"is nothing more to me than a self-evident lie.\\"Codevilla, Angelo (2010-07-16) America's Ruling Class, The American Spectator The debate over Pettit's inflammatory words is credited with reviving Abraham Lincoln's interest in national politics.

There he proceeded B.A. in 1599, and M.A. in 1602. In 1604 he obtained leave to travel and spent the next four years in Europe, mainly with Swiss and German Calvinists, spending a winter at the University of Heidelberg with David Pareas and Abraham Scultetus.P.

His decision however in 1622 to present the prince with a treatise written by himself and arguing against the ongoing negotiations for a Spanish match led to the abrupt end of his career at court. The treatise was shown to the prince's father, James I of England, who committed Hakewill to a prison for a brief period and appointed Lancelot Andrewes to rebut the tract. Later life Despite this setback in 1624 Hakewill single-handedly paid for the building of Exeter College chapel (consecrated 15 October 1624), at a cost of ¬£1200. (In his will he requested that his heart be buried there,\\"...my desire then is to bee buried in mine owne Church, and that my body being opned (if conveniently it may bee, my hart may bee embalmed, and buried in the foresaid Chappell under the Cumunion table, or the Deske uppon which the great bible lyes with this inscription in brasse layd upon it, Cor meum ad te Domine\\": Will of George Hakewill, 1649. ('Cor meum ad te Domine' was the motto on the Hakewill coat-of-arms.) though there is no evidence this was carried out.) Hakewill was eventually made Rector of Exeter College (elected 23 August 1642; 18 admitted November 1642). He however \\"did little, or not at all, reside upon that rectory: For the civil wars breaking out, he returned to his parsonage...where he lived a retired life to the time of his death.\\" Prince, John. (1701). The Worthies of Devon The parsonage in question was the Rectory of Heanton Punchardon near Barnstaple in Devon, to which he had been presented by his kinsman Sir Robert Basset.

First beganne for the comfort of a gentlewoman bereaved of her sight and since upon occasion inlarged (second edition, 1608; third edition, 1615; and another impression, 1633); a Latin treatise against regicides (1612); and Apologie ... of the Power and Providence of God (1627).

The latter work, a rebuttal of the view that creation, including humanity, was gradually declining, was praised by Samuel Pepys and is cited by James Boswell as one of the formative influences on the prose of Samuel Johnson. Hakewill's style has been described as \\"lively and forceful\\". By a brief marriage to Mary Ayer or Ayers (n√©e Delbridge) Hakewill had two sons, John and George. George appears to have died in childhood. After becoming a fellow of Exeter College, John also died within his father's lifetime in 1637. Hakewill's will shows that, despite his theological leanings towards radical Protestantism, he remained politically a royalist\\"...Thus beseeching Allmighty god to blesse the Kings Maty His Church and State by making up the unhappie and unnaturall breaches & Distractions thereof\\": Will of George Hakewill, 1649 and loyal to the Church of England as established.\\"...For my Religion in this lamentable varietie of new and strange opinions now on foot, I proffesse with St Hierome, In eadem religione in qu»É Infans baptizatus sum senex morior\\": Will of George Hakewill, 1649 He also left a bequest to his \\"dear brother\\" William Hakewill, a noted supporter of the opposing Parliamentarian party.

Overview After a period of inactivity because of Martha Reeves' mental illness, the singer returned to the studio with the new version of The Vandellas, who had gone through different member lineups. By now, the lineup of The Vandellas included Reeves' kid sister Lois Reeves and a former member of The Velvelettes named Sandra Tilley. The group had sporadically recorded and performed together before 1970 when they issued the Natural Resources album. For their next project, Motown decided to recruit the hotly new hit-making producers for the label: The Corporation, to help them with producing their new album. Among the first singles they worked on was a Jackson 5-styled funky dance record titled \\"Bless You\\". Featuring Martha and the Vandellas members, it also included additional harmony singing parts by The Blackberries. Release Released in the fall of 1971, \\"Bless You\\" briefly brought the group back to modest success on the Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number fifty-three on the chart, becoming their highest-charted single in two years and their highest-charted single on the pop chart during their brief seventies period together. The single also crossed over successfully to the R&B; chart where it peaked at number twenty- nine and hit the top forty in the United Kingdom where it peaked at number thirty-three and was a top twenty hit in Canada.

The Seattle-licensed station had an urban contemporary format, the first FM station in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest to target the African American community. It was owned by Monte Strohl's Foremost Broadcasting. In January 1964, KZAM was placed into receivership; the month prior, it left the air. It was acquired by Bellevue Broadcasters, a limited partnership led by Kemper Freeman. Bellevue, which owned KFKF 1540 AM in that city, relocated the station facilities and license from Seattle to Bellevue in January 1966, and later that year, KZAM became KFKF-FM. The two stations simulcasted a middle of the road (MOR) format. In August 1972, Freeman sold the stations to a partnership headed by Stewart Ballinger, with the station changing its call sign to KBES (reflecting the new licensee, Bellevue/Eastside Radio), but retaining the MOR format. =Progressive KZAM-FM and AC KLSY= 92.5 flipped to progressive rock and became KZAM on December 16, 1974 (changing to KZAM-FM shortly thereafter), with the full format launching April 1, 1975. In May 1978, Sandusky Newspapers bought the stations (1540 AM would be sold in January 1992 to different owners due to Sandusky's acquisition of AM 880 KIXI from Sunbelt Communications). KZAM was also noteworthy for the number of women on its airstaff and its stronger-than-usual performance with women in the market. The decision to put women on the air was part of a deliberate effort to build a new audience counter-programming against then-dominant \\"high-testosterone\\" rock music stations. However, particularly after the Sandusky sale, the staff that had started the station began to leave. KZAM flipped on July 18, 1983 to adult contemporary as \\"Classy\\" KLSY. The station saw its ratings increase, but it was challenged several times by other AC stations in the mid-1980s, and became the sister station of similarly formatted KRWM in 1996. From 1988 to December 2003, mornings on KLSY were hosted by Bruce Murdock, Tim Hunter and Alice Porter. On February 1, 2002, at 9 a.m., the station altered its format to Adult Top 40 as \\"Mix 92.5\\" but retained the KLSY calls. In December 2003, the longtime morning team of Murdock, Hunter and Porter left the station; Mitch Elliot and Lisa Foster, who hosted afternoons, were moved to mornings. =MOViN 92.5= On May 1, 2006, at 11 a.m., after playing \\"Closing Time\\" by Semisonic, KLSY began stunting with songs that had a \\"goodbye\\" or \\"farewell\\" theme, as well as playing slogans from various radio stations around the country (i.e. \\"The Best Songs of the 70s, 80s, 90s, and Today\\"). At noon, the station flipped to rhythmic AC as \\"MOViN 92.5\\", giving Seattle its first adult-targeted rhythmic station in four years since the demise of KBTB (now KJR-FM) in 2002. (This format also aired on KBKS from 1996‚Äì1997.) The first song as \\"MOViN\\" was The C+C Music Factory's \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\". KQMV was the first station to use the \\"MOViN\\" branding, from the consultant firm Alan Burns & Associates. KLSY changed call letters to KQMV on May 8, 2006, to match the new branding. Unlike KBKS' AC-leaning direction and KBTB's Rhythmic oldies approach, KQMV featured a mix of rhythmic pop/dance currents, old-school hip hop and R&B;, and disco and classic dance hits in a Top 40-like presentation, targeting females 25-44, and positioning itself to compete with rhythmic Top 40 KUBE and Mainstream Top 40 KBKS. Over the years, KQMV slowly dropped most disco tracks and began emphasizing more currents and old-school Hip Hop, R&B;, and Dance tracks from artists like Prince, Destiny's Child, and Janet Jackson. Beginning in September 2009, the station began tightening its playlist by dropping most old-school tracks, and shifted towards an adult-oriented rhythmic CHR format, though not moving all the way to Rhythmic AC, as it had been. The amount of currents was heavily increased, though the station did retain some old-school titles. As of November 18, 2010, KQMV completed its shift towards a conventional rhythmic contemporary direction, with emphasis on current rhythmic pop/R&B; hits. As a result of this shift, KQMV was added to the Mediabase Rhythmic panel. =Shift to contemporary hit radio= As of November 2010, Mediabase added KQMV to the CHR panel and would rival KBKS and KUBE. On the BDS overall Top 40/CHR panel, KQMV did not contribute its playlist to BDS' monitored chart until 2012 (it also contributes to the Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart) because of the station's rhythmic-heavy playlist. It initially avoided playing any Mainstream Pop/Rock crossovers to avoid overlapping with modern AC sister KLCK-FM. Within three years, KQMV became the highest-rated CHR station in the market, and one of the top radio stations overall. KQMV's success with the format would cause changes at KBKS and KUBE in January 2016: KUBE would move its Rhythmic format to co-owned 104.9 FM, with KUBE's former frequency of 93.3 FM relaunching as Mainstream Top 40 \\"Power 93.3\\", while KBKS switched to a Hot AC format and retained the \\"Kiss FM\\" branding; however, in May 2018, the KUBE call letters and Rhythmic format returned to 93.3, while KBKS dropped Hot AC and returned to Top 40/CHR. =Sale to Hubbard= In July 2013, Sandusky announced it would sell its radio holdings in Seattle and Phoenix to Hubbard Broadcasting, based in St. Paul, Minnesota.

The original open, earthen ditch was completed by community laborers within a month of founding the pueblo. This water system was used for both domestic uses and irrigation to fields west of town. This availability of water was essential to the survival and growth of the community founded here. Brick conduits in diameter were built to improve the system after 1884. Eventually the system did not supply enough water to keep pace with population growth and irrigation demand. The system was abandoned by 1904 though portions were still used for storm water purposes. Origins The Pueblo de Los Angeles was an official settlement of Spain. They had three types of settlements in Alta California: presidio (military), mission (religious) and pueblo (civil). The pueblos would provide the commercial and agricultural needs of the military as an alternative to the missions. Governor Felipe de Neve took the assignment of creating this settlement very seriously and had elaborate plans drawn up outlining the details of its infrastructure. The plan included a governmental directive for the provision of water to be delivered to the settlement, stating, \\"there should be examined all the lands which may receive the benefit of irrigation, marking the place most proper to divert the water, so that it may be allotted to the largest portion of lands.\\" It was also directed that the pueblo be placed on moderately elevated ground so that all the agricultural lands benefiting from the irrigation could be overlooked. This would mean that the supply head would have to be at yet higher ground. The Zanja Madre was placed close to present-day Broadway at the foot of the Elysian Hills by the river. An earth and brush dam, called a toma, was created to pool up the water into the ditch which then ran along an elevated slope down to the pueblo after which it was split into multiple ditches which ran to the various portions of lowland. A large water wheel, constructed in the 1850s, took water up to the Zanja Madre and onto the main brick reservoir that was located in what is now the Plaza at the end of Olvera Street. The wheel was susceptible to damage from floods. The toma was washed away several times before a wooden one was built in its place. Later improvements 1888 map of the Zanja Madre The soft, sandy tunnel collapsed several times and attempts were made to repair it with brick lining, but the whole aqueduct was abandoned in 1884 after a flood tore out the wooden dam. It had already been realized since 1878 that several improvements would have to be done to the zanja systems. Some of this included conversion of the smaller ditches to pipelines while larger areas would be concrete. After this last failure the earthen toma and open ditch were put back into service while more elaborate plans were being made. In 1888 the city planned to put pipe in most of the existing zanjas, but budgetary shortfalls did not allow the work to be finished. The tunnel at the headwater of the Zanja Madre was reconstructed and much of the conduit was either brick or concrete lined. By 1893 there ended up some of zanjas in the city and another of zanjas outside the city limit. Over the years the portion of the Zanja Madre that passed around the north edge of the River Train Yard was realigned again and again until railroad construction eventually demolished most of the conduits as the city built newer types of water systems. Archaeological finds Photo of Olvera Street with enhancement of the brickwork showing the course of the Zanja Madre through the pueblo. Note the Zanja passes right alongside a fountain which would be typical. Various portions have been documented as they have been uncovered during construction projects over the years. In 1978 archaeologist Julia Costello discovered a portion of the Zanja Madre during construction of the Plaza de Dolores. In 2000 two people dug up a section of the Zanja on the steep slope near a Broadway parking garage and were credited by the L.A. Weekly and Los Angeles Times as having discovered the Zanja. Later, archaeologists overseeing site operations near the MTA Gold Line, studied the portions of uncovered brick conduit. They expected to find more portions along the line near the River Yard, but there were no discoveries. It was generally supposed that the Zanja had been destroyed during railroad yard construction over the years. Since it was private property, no archaeological surveys were made. In 2005 MTA construction crews uncovered unexpected sections of the brick Zanja Madre. Archaeologists were brought in to evaluate the finds, most of which were red-brick, penstock-sized aqueducts. Now serious studies and documentation have begun in order to have the Zanja Madre routes put onto historical registers. In 2014 excavation for the foundation of the Blossom Plaza project on North Broadway discovered a . The removal of a of the Zanja Madre for presumed display at various off-site locations has been criticized in the editorial pages of the Daily News and by KCET Departures.

Monsoon was originally associated with OEM-sourced automotive audio speaker systems, notably supplied on a number of General Motors products and then later expanded onto other manufacturers such as Volkswagen. The brand name was also licensed to Sonigistix, a Richmond, B.C., Canada company, and applied to their line of computer multimedia speakers. Sonigistix Sonigistix started out as a project out of the UBC Electrical Engineering company and existed for two years on the UBC campus. Its founder was Brent Bolleman and its first raison d'√™tre was to refine and market an electrostatic computer product based on the design of Quad Electrostatics. Electrostatic speakers have their own problems due to the need for the membrane requiring high voltage, which is dangerous and has the requirement of a step up transformer, which is costly. The ultimate desire was to have a speaker that looked great and sounded great, so the conversion to planar magnetic design, which had problems of its own but easier dealt with, most notably was the need for rare earth magnets, which were expensive. Much of the focus of the transition focused on how to reduce this cost element and make the speakers more appealing to a larger pool of consumers. The early unnamed company started sending out prototypes to United Technologies. Through this the company made contacts with Woody Jackson, a high end audio products expert based in Little Rock Arkansas, and Dave Clark an audio engineer who had ties to Delphi based in Detroit. Clark designed the subwoofer part of the package. Another challenge as the planar magnetic design had a bottom end of 100 Hz and it was key to make the crossover design seamless. By 2000, Sonigistix expanded its product line and the Monsoon brand into the then burgeoning consumer computer multimedia market, developing a solid reputation for their flat-panel speaker designs that were popular with computer users keen on obtaining quality high fidelity from their computer hardware. Monsoon's speaker designs were based on planar magnetic technology, licensed from Eminent Technology who developed the original concept. However, despite the brand's popularity among computer users ‚Äì or perhaps because of it ‚Äì within the next couple of years the assets of Sonigistix were purchased by Eastech, an Asian technology company that also focuses on providing consumer products in a variety of audio-based markets. As for Sonigistix, a privately held company by that name currently resides in Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.A. An online company profile on goliath.ecnext.com lists this Little Rock company, being Woody Jackson as being in the home audio/video industry. An owner's manual for the MM-700/iM-700 Flat Panel Audio System with a copyright of 2000 shows the Monsoon Multimedia Sales office address as Little Rock, Arkansas. Eastech Monsoon-branded products continued for a time under Eastech (under the Level 9 name), but by late 2004 Monsoon computer speakers had essentially disappeared from the U.S. marketplace. By 2005, Eastech no longer sold Monsoon speakers. Legacy Monsoon-branded speakers, whether sold by Sonigistix or Level 9, have developed an almost cult-like following due to their perceived high sound quality and accuracy, particularly uncommon (at the time of their run) for the personal computer marketplace. Dedicated owners of Monsoon flat panel speakers will often go to great lengths to keep their old Monsoons running, primarily because it is assumed that replacements made and sold by other manufacturers may be inferior.\\"The original Monsoon flat-panel systems were arguably the most accurate computer speakers ever sold\\", Level 9 Monsoon PlanarMedia 14 review by Don Labriola in Pcmag 2003-06-17, retrieved 2009-03-11 When the Richmond, BC, factory closed, a loudspeaker repair shop in Vancouver, BC, obtained the remaining stock of tweeters, midranges and woofers as replacement parts. The replacement parts were exhausted by 2008, leaving the use of salvaged parts as the only options for units that have failed. The most common issue with midrange and tweeter elements is corroded NeFeB magnets. Sadly, this corrosion is a terminal condition and cannot be reversed or repaired, however there is rumour around the \\"Monsoon Community\\" that this problem may have been resolved in some of the final production runs. As for the Monsoon brand, it remains a trademark of Delphi. This allows GM to exploit the reputation that the Sonigistix products developed, by using the Monsoon brand for their current in-car entertainment products, although made by several other companies. Currently Monsoon in-car audio is optional on several GM cars.

Merton, is an approach to sociological theorizing aimed at integrating theory and empirical research. It is currently the de facto dominant approach to sociological theory construction, especially in the United States. Middle-range theory starts with an empirical phenomenon (as opposed to a broad abstract entity like the social system) and abstracts from it to create general statements that can be verified by data. This approach stands in contrast to the earlier \\"grand\\" theorizing of social theory, such as functionalism and many conflict theories. Raymond Boudon has argued that \\"middle-range\\" theory is the same concept that most other sciences simply call \\"theory\\". The analytical sociology movement has as its aim the unification of such theories into a coherent paradigm at a greater level of abstraction. Definition The term \\"middle-range theory\\" does not refer to a specific theory, but is rather an approach to theory construction. Raymond Boudon defines middle-range theory as a commitment to two ideas. The first is positive, and describes what such theories should do: sociological theories, like all scientific theories, should aim to consolidate otherwise segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities; \\"if a 'theory' is valid, it 'explains' and in other words 'consolidates' and federates empirical regularities which on their side would appear otherwise segregated.\\" The other is negative, and it relates to what theory cannot do: \\"it is hopeless and quixotic to try to determine the overarching independent variable that would operate in all social processes, or to determine the essential feature of social structure, or to find out the two, three, or four couples of concepts ... that would be sufficient to analyze all social phenomena\\". History The midrange approach was developed by Robert Merton as a departure from the general social theorizing of Talcott Parsons. Merton agreed with Parsons that a narrow empiricism consisting entirely of simple statistical or observational regularities cannot arrive at successful theory. However, he found that Parsons' \\"formulations were remote from providing a problematics and a direction for theory-oriented empirical inquiry into the observable worlds of culture and society\\".Robert K. Merton - California State University, Dominguez Hills He was thus directly opposed to the abstract theorizing of scholars who are engaged in the attempt to construct a total theoretical system covering all aspects of social life. With the introduction of the middle-range theory programme, he advocated that sociologists should concentrate on measurable aspects of social reality that can be studied as separate social phenomena, rather than attempting to explain the entire social world. He saw both the middle-range theory approach and middle-range theories themselves as temporary: when they matured, as natural sciences already had, the body of middle-range theories would become a system of universal laws; but, until that time, social sciences should avoid trying to create a universal theory.Mj√∏set, Lars. 1999. \\"Understanding of Theory in the Social Sciences.\\" ARENA working papers. Merton's original foil in the construction was Talcott Parsons, whose action theory C. Wright Mills later classified as a \\"grand theory\\". (Parsons vehemently rejected this categorization.) Middle-range theories are normally constructed by applying theory-building techniques to empirical research, which produce generic propositions about the social world, which in turn can also be empirically tested. Examples of middle-range theories are theories of reference groups, social mobility, normalization processes, role conflict and the formation of social norms. The middle-range approach has played a role in turning sociology into an increasingly empirically oriented discipline. This was also important in post-war thought. In the post-war period, middle-range theory became the dominant approach to theory construction in all variable- based social sciences. Middle-range theory has also been applied to the archaeological realm by Lewis R. Binford, and to financial theory by Robert C. Merton, Robert K. Merton's son. In the recent decades, the analytical sociology programme has emerged as an attempt synthesizing middle-range theories into a more coherent abstract framework (as Merton had hoped would eventually happen). Peter Hedstr√∂m at Oxford is the scholar most associated with this approach, while Peter Bearman is its most prominent American advocate.

His seven seasons included three World Series as well as a World Series championship in 1955. He was the first National League player to hit a pinch-hit home run in a World Series game. Shuba is often remembered for his symbolic role in breaking down Major League Baseball's tenacious \\"color barrier\\". While playing for the AAA Montreal Royals in 1946, Shuba offered a congratulatory handshake to teammate Jackie Robinson, who went on to become the first African American to play in a major league game since the late 19th century. The moment was captured in a well-known photograph dubbed A Handshake for the Century for featuring the first interracial handshake in a professional baseball game. In the early 1970s, Shuba's major league career was featured in a chapter of Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, a tribute to the 1950s Brooklyn Dodgers. Kahn observed in his book that Shuba earned his nickname, \\"Shotgun\\", by \\"spraying line drives with a swing so compact that it appeared as natural as a smile\\".Kahn (1972), p. 224.Schudel, Matt (October 1, 2014) \\"Dodger outfielder‚Äôs greatest hit: Handshake\\", The Washington Post, page B4 Retrieved September 23, 2017 Early life Shuba was born the youngest of 10 children to Slovak immigrants in Youngstown, Ohio, a steel-manufacturing town with a strong tradition of amateur and minor league baseball. His father, Jan Shuba, emigrated from eastern Czechoslovakia in 1912. Jan Shuba was 45 years old at the time of George's birth, and he did little to encourage his son's interest in sports.Kahn (1972), p. 231. As a child, George Shuba attended Holy Name Elementary School, a parochial school on the city's heavily Eastern European west side. Shuba was an avid baseball player throughout his youth, and he usually served as a second baseman in neighborhood games.Kahn (1972), p. 232. In 1943, when he was 17 years old, he participated in a tryout for the Brooklyn Dodgers and eventually signed a contract.Kahn (1972), p. 233. As Shuba later recalled, an ear injury sustained while being disciplined by a teacher prevented him from entering the U.S. Army during World War II. He would gain valuable experience playing for minor league clubs throughout the war years. Baseball career After signing a contract with the Dodgers, Shuba played for farm teams in New Orleans and Mobile.Kahn (1972), pp. 234-235. He later recalled that his father opposed the move, because he \\"thought I should go and work in the mills like him\\".Kahn (1972), p. 233. Shuba pursued his goal, however, developing his \\"natural\\" swing by practicing for hours with a rope that was tied to the ceiling. He made knots in the rope where the strike zone would be and swung a bat at the rope 600 times a day. This rigorously observed ritual prepared Shuba to compete in the major leagues, where his powerful line drives later earned him the nickname, \\"Shotgun\\". =The Handshake= Montreal Royals shortstop Jackie Robinson crosses the plate in Roosevelt Stadium, Jersey City, after hitting his first career home run and is congratulated by teammate George Shuba. In the mid-1940s, Shuba was recruited by the Montreal Royals, a major farm team for the Brooklyn Dodgers. The New York Times described the historic day: > On the afternoon of April 18, 1946, Robinson became the first black player > in modern organized baseball when he made his debut with the Dodgers‚Äô > Montreal Royals farm team in their International League opener against the > Jersey City Giants. In the third inning, Robinson hit a three-run homer over > the left-field fence. When he completed his trip around the bases, Shuba, > the Royals‚Äô left fielder and their next batter, shook his hand. > Congratulating a home-run hitter was a commonplace ritual, but Shuba's > welcome to a smiling Robinson was captured in an Associated Press photograph > that has endured as a portrait of racial tolerance. The moment was described as the first interracial handshake in North American baseball's recent history. On December 3, 2019 it was reported that a 7-foot statue of the handshake would be created and placed in Shuba's hometown, Youngstown, Ohio. It is scheduled to be unveiled on April 18, 2021, the 75th anniversary of the handshake. =Minor Leagues= Despite a record that seemed to merit promotion, he spent the 1947 and 1948 baseball seasons with the minor league Mobile Bears.Kahn (1972), p. 235. Shuba later told Roger Kahn that in 1947, he hit 21 home runs and knocked in 110 runs. The next year, Shuba worked up a batting average of .389. In response, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey complained that Shuba's \\"power fell off\\", adding that the team needed \\"someone who can hit them over that short right-field wall in Ebbets Field\\". Frustrated, Shuba returned to Mobile in the spring of 1948. \\"What could I say?\\" Shuba explained in an interview with Kahn. \\"As long as he could option me, you know, send me down but keep me Dodger property, Rickey would do that so's he could keep some other guy whose option ran out. Property, that's what we were. But how many guys you know ever hit .389 and never got promoted?\\" =The Majors= Shuba made his major league debut with the Dodgers on July 2, 1948. At the peak of his playing career, Shuba delivered a pinch-hit homer in the 1953 World Series opener, which the New York Yankees won 9‚Äì5. Ultimately, he worked up a career batting average of .259 on 211 hits in 814 trips, with 125 RBIs, 106 runs scored, and 45 doubles and 24 homers. Playing for the Dodgers, Shuba watched as teammate Jackie Robinson won the league's MVP (1949). A recent feature article noted that Shuba's \\"best year was in 1952 when he batted .305 (78-for-256) with nine homers, 40 RBIs and 40 runs scored\\". Knee surgery, however, reduced his effectiveness after that season. Shuba played his final game on September 25, 1955. He appeared in the seventh and final game of that year's World Series; he pinch-hit for Don Zimmer in the sixth inning and grounded out for the final out. The Dodgers defeated the Yankees on Johnny Podres' 2-0 shutout for what would be the franchise's only World Championship in its Brooklyn history (the Dodgers would move to Los Angeles after the 1957 season). Personal life Shuba remained single during his professional baseball career. Roger Kahn wrote in The Boys of Summer that the young player spent his years with the Dodgers as \\"a bachelor living alone and apart from the rest of the players\\".Kahn (1972), p. 224. After retiring from Major League Baseball, Shuba returned to Ohio, where he met his future wife. The couple settled in Austintown, a suburb of Youngstown, where Shuba spent 25 years working in the office of the United States Postal Inspection Service. Shuba and his wife, Katherine, who was nine years his junior, raised three children.Kahn (1972), p. 228. Despite the visibility he gained as a professional athlete, Shuba remained deeply connected to his ethnic and religious roots. Kahn recalled that during a visit to the Shuba household in the early 1970s, the ex-ballplayer recited a mealtime prayer in the Slovak language. Shuba explained to Kahn that his father had recited the prayer before every family meal. Retirement Shuba lived in the Youngstown area since his retirement from Major League Baseball in 1955. In the early 1970s, he was interviewed at his Austintown home by Roger Kahn, who was conducting research for The Boys of Summer, a literary tribute to the 1950s Brooklyn Dodgers. Over the years, Shuba received recognition for his symbolic role in promoting interracial harmony in professional baseball. A 2006 article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune noted that he continued to take pride in the photograph of his groundbreaking handshake with teammate Robinson. A copy of the photo hung behind his favorite living room chair. During a 1996 interview with a Youngstown news reporter, Shuba recalled his impressions of the legendary Robinson: \\"To me, Jackie was like all the other guys, a player who came to play and we knew he would be a good one, but what me or anyone else at the time didn't know was how good he would be\\". In a 2007 reference to Robinson's courage and determination, Shuba credited the other player with imparting \\"a lesson about life that I have never forgotten\\". That same year, Shuba highlighted the event in his memoir, My Memories as a Brooklyn Dodger, which he co-wrote with Youngstown-area writer Greg Gulas. On September 18, 2007, Youngstown's Borts Ball Field, a west side recreational spot that Shuba frequented as a child, was renamed as the George \\"Shotgun\\" Shuba Field at Borts Park. Shuba died on September 29, 2014, at the age of 89. He was the last living Brooklyn Dodger who appeared in the final game of the 1955 World Series, the only one won by the Dodgers in their Brooklyn history. Notes References * Kahn, Roger (1972).

It has about 200 inhabitants. History Grand Hotel Csorba The future resort began to emerge in 1872 when (\\"of St. John\\". 1817‚Äì1906, from a noble family with roots in the nearby village of Liptovsk√Ω J√°n, originally: Sv. J√°n, \\"St. John\\") built a hunting lodge on the banks of ≈†trbsk√© pleso. Access to the High Tatras was made easier the year before when the railroad reached Poprad in their foothills. Szentiv√°nyi rented the lot from the village of ≈†trba whose municipal lands included the lake and which gave its name to it. He opened it to tourists a year later and allowed the Carpathian Union, a hiking society, to build its own Chalet Joseph nearby in 1875. The accommodation facilities that Szentiv√°nyi kept adding made it a popular destination. The rack railway connecting it to the main railroad was built in 1896. The first ski school was organized in 1899. The Tatra trolley linked it with other resorts on the Slovak side of the Tatras in 1912. The resort was acquired by the government in 1901. The adjacent area of Nov√© ≈†trbsk√© Pleso began to develop in 1897 when the land was purchased by the architect Karol M√≥ry of Bansk√° Bystrica. He dammed the Mlynica Brook in 1900 to flood a minor marsh, create the small \\"New Lake of ≈†trba\\", and enhance the charm of his property. A treaty of alliance between the governments of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia was signed in ≈†trbsk√© Pleso on 27 June 1930, that created a regular consultative structure for the Little Entente and registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 3 October 1930.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 107, pp. 216-219. ≈†trbsk√© Pleso was considerably modernized in the 1970s, including the construction of several hotels, ski jumps etc. Another big reconstruction of almost all the hotels and sport areas took place in years 2007-2014 before the 2015 Winter Universiade Tourism With extensive parking facilities and a stop on the Tatra trolley and rack railway, it is a starting point for a host of popular hikes including to Kriv√°≈à and Rysy.

It aired weekday mornings from 9 am to 10 am on TVNZ 1 from April 1996 to 2015. The programme was hosted by Jeanette Thomas. Episodes typically included segments on cooking, craft, exercise, fashion and beauty, and topical discussion panels, as well as interviews with celebrities and other noteworthy people. The show was typically broadcast live, with the usual exception of advertorials that were embedded in the programme. History The programme debuted in 1996, originally broadcast from Wellington, with its inaugural host Liz Gunn. Production then moved to Auckland in 1997, and the show became closely linked to its next host, Mary Lambie, who hosted the series from 1997 to 2003. The content of the series through 1996 and 2003 at times was experimental featuring dating segments, Lambie PI, TV talkback, and Lambie's on-set cat Louis. Production finally moved to TVNZ's Avalon Studios in Lower Hutt in 2004 when it made sense for Avalon studios to have a regular series based in Wellington. The two-host format with Brendon Pongia and Sarah Bradley began in 2006. In 2007, the show grew from a two- to a three-hour weekday show with ONE News bulletins inserted into the programme at 10am and 11am. In July 2007, Steve Gray, the show's long-time film and DVD reviewer (11 years) also started co-hosting the show until the end of 2009. Former ONE News reporter Hadyn Jones joined the Good Morning team as a new co-host in 2010. In April 2011, TVNZ CEO Rick Ellis announced that as part of TVNZ's plan to sell its Avalon Studios, Good Morning would be moved to a new Auckland studio and Jeanette Thomas & Rod Cheeseman replaced Sarah Bradley & Brendon Pongia as hosts in 2012. In 2013, the show was reduced from a three- to a one-hour weekday show and Rod Cheeseman left. The show was hosted by Jeanette Thomas, with Astar and Matai Smith, with Melanie Kerr as the Advertorial Presenter. The show ended in December 2015.

It was created in 1990, and its official name from 1990 to 1999 was Star√Ω Smokovec, which is the name of one of its major settlements. Features and statistics The town of Vysok√© Tatry is special in many aspects. It is not a true town, but a conglomerate of separate and different settlements (originally separate villages), whose only common feature is that they are the main tourist resorts in the Slovak High Tatras, while being connected through a common railway network (the Tatra Railway). After the country's capital, the town is Slovakia's major tourist destination. It has around 4,000 inhabitants, excluding tourists. It is located at an elevation of above sea level. Covering , it is Slovakia's second-largest urban area, after the country's capital, and was the largest until 2007, when the village of ≈†trbsk√© Pleso became a part of ≈†trba after ≈†trba's municipal government's successful claim on the Supreme Court. The local authority, cultural centre, and main shops are located in the settlement of Star√Ω Smokovec. Administrative division A map of the three originally separate municipalities in this area making up the present-day town The town consists of three cadastral areas, which consist of 14 settlements: *≈†trbsk√© Pleso (the settlement itself was transferred to the village of ≈†trba, according to the ruling of the Supreme Court)≈†trbsk√© Pleso patr√≠ mestu ≈†trba ‚Äì newspaper Pravda, 3 May 2007 (in Slovak) **Vy≈°n√© H√°gy (f. in 1890, 1125 m) **Podbansk√© (f. in 1871, 940 m, partly in the village of Pribylina now) *Star√Ω Smokovec **Horn√Ω Smokovec (950 m) **Doln√Ω Smokovec (890 m) **Nov√Ω Smokovec (1 000 m) **Star√Ω Smokovec (founded in 1793, 1 010 m) **Tatransk√° Polianka (f. in 1885, 1 005 m) **Tatransk√© Zruby (f. in 1923, 995 m) **Nov√° Polianka (f. in 1946, 1 060 m) *Tatransk√° Lomnica **Tatransk√° Lomnica (f. in 1893, 850 m) **Tatransk√° Kotlina (f. in 1881, 760 m) **Tatransk√° Lesn√° (f. in 1927, 915 m) **Ke≈æmarsk√© ≈Ωƒæaby (920 m) **Tatransk√© Matliare (f. in the mid-19th century, 885 m) History The present-day town was created in 1990 and has a complicated administrative history. The municipality (that is, not a town) of Vysok√© Tatry was created as early as 1947 on the territory of the following formerly distinct municipalities: Batizovce, Huncovce, Folvarky, Gerlachov, Ke≈æmarok, Liptovsk√° Kokava, Mlynica, Nov√° Lesn√°, Mal√Ω Slavkov, Mengusovce,v√Ωbor Vysok√© Tatry\\" - literally, \\"The United National Committee of High Tatras\\", 'national committee' being the term then used to designate local authorities in Czechoslovakia. In 1954, parts of the municipalities Pribylina (the majority of which was returned in 2004), V√Ωchodn√°, and Liptovsk√° Kokava were added to Vysok√© Tatry. Star√Ω Smokovec was made the seat of the Vysok√© Tatry municipality. In 1960, the Vysok√© Tatry municipality ceased to exist and was divided into the following separate municipalities: Star√Ω Smokovec (enhanced with town status), ≈†trbsk√© Pleso, Tatransk√° Lomnica, ≈Ωdiar, and ≈†t√¥la. However, since 1964 these municipalities had again a common local authority, although they remained distinct municipalities. In 1990, three of the above municipalities - Star√Ω Smokovec, ≈†trbsk√© pleso and Tatransk√° Lomnica - were merged to create the town of 'Star√Ω Smokovec'(named after the settlement serving as the seat of the authorities). The remaining municipalities - ≈Ωdiar and ≈†t√¥la - are still independent municipalities. In 1999, the town of 'Star√Ω Smokovec' was renamed 'Vysok√© Tatry'. Demographics On 31 December 2006, Vysok√© Tatry had a population of 4,718. According to the 2001 census, 92.95% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.22% Czechs, 0.57% Hungarians, 0.26% Germans, and 0.17% Rusyns. The religious make- up was as follows: 61.96% Roman Catholics, 18.96% people with no religious affiliation, 7.64% Lutherans, and 3.62% Greek Catholics. Sport In 1935 and 1970 the area hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. The area was scheduled to host the 17th Winter Deaflympics, but the event was cancelled because of the lack of readiness by the Slovakian Deaflympic Organizing Committee to host the games.

Officially known as Karachi Nuclear Power Complex, the power generation site is composed of three commercial nuclear power plants with two plants under construction with the financing and investment provided by China and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The nuclear power plant has a distinction of being the first commercial nuclear plant in the Muslim world. After a lengthy and complicated negotiations with Canada, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant was constructed by Canadian firms in 1965 and it went critical in November 1972. The power station is subjected to regular IAEA monitoring, and is undergoing expansion with two nuclear power plants financed and funded by both IAEA and China. History In 1960, Abdus Salam, then-science adviser to Ayub administration, provided a strong advocacy for the industrial usage of the nuclear power in his country at the UN General Assembly, paving away a path for the establishment of the nuclear power plant. Despite the strong opposition from the officials in the Ayub administration, it was the personal efforts of Abdus Salam who had the funding and financing of the nuclear power plant approved from President Ayub Khan. In 1963, the Government of Pakistan commissioned the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) to conduct the survey for the nuclear power plant which selected the Paradise Point and Hawke's Bay as the ideal locations‚Äî the GSP selected Paradise Point for the location. Negotiations and talks took place with Canada over the supply of the nuclear power plant in Karachi and the contract was signed with General Electric Canada as the designer and employed the Montreal Engineering Company as its civil engineering firm in 1965. The nuclear power plant was jointly designed by the engineers of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the Canada's General Electric to provide distinction and difference from the India's nuclear research reactors such as CIRUS and Dhruva reactors that uses the same CANDU technology. The decision-making factor that was taken under consideration to sell the CANDU technology to Pakistan by Canada was seen as maintaining a balance of power between India and Pakistan. In 1966, the civil engineering and construction started by the Montreal Engineering Co. which finished its construction in 1971. The nuclear power plant attained criticality on 1 August 1971, and commenced on producing full power generation on 2 October 1972. On 28 November 1972, President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto inaugurated the Karachi Nuclear Plant when it was connected with the grid system of K-Electric, an investor-owned energy supply utility based in Karachi. Initially, Canada, through its contractor GE Canada, supplied the deuterium oxide moderator and the natural uranium but it wanted to eject from supporting the operations of the nuclear power plant after 1974 when India exploded the nuclear bomb whose fissile material was produced in CIRUS reactor initially supplied by Canada.P.L. Bhola, Pakistan's Nuclear Policy (New Delhi: Sterling Publishers Private Limited, 1993), p. 27. In 1975, the GE Canada begin to charge Pakistan $27/lb for deuterium oxide which was expensive for the country to afford. With Pakistan's refusal of becoming the party of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the GE Canada halted to sell of imported spare parts, natural uranium, heavy water, and technical support for the nuclear power plant, raising fears of Karachi going under a blackout phase in 1976. With Canadian technicians departing the country, the city was exposed to open radioactive materials while estimating that the nuclear power plant would shut down in six months. Despite Canadian skepticism, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was able to worked on producing deuterium oxide at lesser price, and set up the machine shop to manufacture its machinery and tools near nuclear power plant with the assistance from Karachi University. The Canadian ejection from the project turned out to be a blessing in disguise because it allowed the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission establish its own machine shops, welding facilities, and training centers with the help from Karachi University that proved to be pivotal on country's production of able machinists and qualified welders as well as nuclear fuel cycle technology. Since 1979, the deuterium oxide and heavy water is locally and indigenously produced by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission that kept the plant running its grid operations. Many of spare parts and machine components were locally designed that kept the nuclear power plant running its grid operation in safe manner‚Äì the valuable experience gained was shared to Chinese officials in designing the reactor safety protocols and eventually helped run the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant in 1993. After intense negotiations and with the IAEA's cooperation in May 1990, Canadian policy towards Karachi Nuclear Power Plant was revised allowing it to provide assistance for Safe Operation of KANUPP (SOK) through the IAEA and only for the IAEA suggested remedial actions. In 2015 and 2016, China showed great interest in expanding the energy capacity of Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and signed an agreement to supply two Hualong One nuclear power plants with the start of commercial operations scheduled for 2021 and 2022 respectively. Reactor units will have a design life of 60 years and account for approximately 10% of the country's total generation capacity. As of 31 December 2017, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant has generated 14.2 billion kWhr of electricity and been fueled by thousands of Pakistan-made fuel bundles without any failure. Reactor technology =KANUPP-1= The first reactor unit at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant is a single CANDU-type pressurized heavy-water reactor (PHWR)with a total gross energy generation capacity of 137 Megawatts (MW). The KANUPP-1 uses the water-cooled Deuterium oxide (D2O or heavy water) moderator with natural uranium serving it as its fuel. The KANUPP-1 is one of the oldest reactor that still uses the CANDU-type PHWR system to generate energy. The reactor consists of a tubed calandria vessel of austenitic stainless steel, which contains the heavy water moderator and 208 coolant tube assemblies. The moderator system consists of the calandria, coolers, pumps and purification system in the heavy water circuit, and control valves, dump valves and helium blowers in the helium circuit. The fuel is natural uranium in the form of sintered uranium dioxide pellets sheathed in thin zirconium alloy tubes to form solid fuel elements about 19.1 inches (48.53 cm) long by 0.6 inches (1.4 cm) diameter. In 2010, a Multi-effect distillation (MED) process source was connected to Karachi Nuclear Power Plant that can produce 1600 m3/d of potable water. In addition, a Reverse osmosis plant is also coupled with the nuclear power plant that is producing 454 m3/d of water for reactor usage. Between 1970‚Äì90s, the KANUPP-1 has generated energy of about ~7.9 billion units of electricity with an average lifetime availability factor of 55.9%. The Canadian technicians designed the life of the plant operations for ~30 years which it did complete its lifetime in 2002.\\"KANUPP Gets 10 Year Extension,\\" Nuclear Engineering International, 16 December 1999. The Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA), the owner of the nuclear power plant, extended its lifetime operation to 2012, and is currently kept 8.1% capacity factor with total energy generation of 90 MW as of 2020. The KANUPP-1 is expected to decommissioned and has been scheduled for closer in 2022 which would mark the end of its 40-year long services to the nation. =KANUPP-2= In 2015, Chinese energy contractors became interested in Karachi Nuclear Power Plant ‚Äì eventually the Pakistani administration and Chinese government signed an energy agreement to construct two Hualong One reactor units at the $9.5 Bn with each reactor producing 1,100 MW.Pakistan to start work on Chinese-aided nuclear power plant The KANUPP-2 is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) supplied by the China National Nuclear Corporation, and is jointly designed by the engineers of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. On 26 November 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ceremonially broke ground on an energy project at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant for the construction of two reactor units, one consisting the Hualong One and the other is ACPR-1000‚Äî both are pressurized water reactor. Construction of the KANUPP-2 begins on 20 August 2015 and the KANUPP-3's construction commenced on 31 May 2016. Both units are near completion and are expected to attain full energy capacity in 2021 and 2022 respectively. According to Dr. Ansar Pervaiz, then Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, said that Chinese banks have provided $6.5 Bn for this project as loans and the cold testing of the reactor system at the KANUPP-2 was commenced on 9 December 2019.China commits $6.5 billion for nuclear power project in Karachi The China Zhongyuan Engineering Corporation (CZEC) is currently serving its civil engineering consultant for both reactors. =KANUPP-3= The KANUPP-3 is a sister Hualong One nuclear reactor supplied by the China National Nuclear Corporation whose construction was commenced on on 31 May 2016, being constructed alongside KANUPP-2. As similar to Hualong One, the ACPR-1000 is also being built in Karachi with Chinese supervision and the first steam engine was installed on 28 August 2018. The KANUPP-3 is expected to join the nation's power grid system by October 2021. Energy management =Electricity grid connections= The National Engineering Services (NES) provides consultancy on energy management of the nuclear power plant and manages the electricity power transmission operations by replacing the aging transformers, three-phase electric powerlines, circuit breakers, and protective relay of the 132 kV double circuit transmission line that links the nuclear power plant to the K-Electric. The NES often works closely with the Institute of Power Engineering of the Karachi University to devise discriminative protection scheme and its integration into the nuclear power plants grid system. In 2010, the NES and Institute of Power Engineering engaged in replacing the electromechanical power relays with the SF6 circuit breakers and modern numerical line protection devices. =Energy capacity and corporate management= The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant was designed to produce gross energy at 137 MWe with the corresponding net output is 125 MWe. From 1972‚Äì79, the nuclear power plant operated with relatively high availability capacity factors upto 70%‚Äì it provided the electricity and energy to the whole city of Karachi. Between 1972‚Äì92, the nuclear power plant generated the energy about 7.9 billion units of electricity with an average lifetime availability capacity factor of 55.9%. In 1994, the nuclear power plant was exceptionally operated at 85.81% of capacity factor‚Äì the highest since its establishment. In 2002‚Äì04, the nuclear power plant was shut down due to maintenance issues, and is now kept at 55.55% capacity factor, nominally producing 90 MW of energy generation. With the completion of the two more units, the nuclear power plant is expected to produce over 2000 MW of electricity at an 80-90% capacity. The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant is owned by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) of Pakistan that is responsible for licensing, inspection and ensuring the safety procedures taking place while running the power plant. The National Engineering Services (NES) of Pakistan, the contractor, manages nuclear power plant on site on behalf of Nuclear Regulatory Authority and oversees the overall electricity distribution of nuclear power plant including the employment of transformers and grid connections over the city. The K-Electric supports the NES operations to manage the plant and relays on energy provided by the nuclear power plant to feed through its circuits. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, on the other hand, has the responsibility of running the overall operations of the nuclear power plant including computerized machinery, plant stimulators, and manufacturing of fuel bundles, producing fuel cycle, manufacturing tools, and employing of computers. Reception =Power outages, leakages, engineering= The Karachi Nuclear Power Plant received wide range of media publicity and fame when it was inaugurated by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on 2 November 1972, accompanied by nation's top scientists and high ranking civic officials. Since 2000, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant has been subjected to a political debate and controversy between nation's anti-nuclear power and pro-nuclear power activists due to its repeated shutdown to generate energy to provide to the city. In 2000, Zia Mian, a physicist at the SDPI based in Islamabad, compared the performance and efficiency of nuclear power plant as \\"six worst performing reactors in the world.\\" In the wake of nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan in 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) of Pakistan did a safety inspection of the nuclear power plant. Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy who visited the nuclear power plant as part of the inspection viewed negatively of the performance of the plant and was very critical of IAEA's monitoring of the plant. Without the Canadian material support, the nuclear power plant has been shutdown multiple times in the years of 1979, 1982, 1993, and in 2002. The power outages at the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant has been reported to high as compared to the other Canadian CANDU reactor, mainly attributed to equipment and regulation failure. In 2002, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority was established to set up the regulation codes, safety regulations, and statues based on the experience learned in running the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. The uranium hexafluoride (UF6) leakages in nuclear steam cylinder has been commonly reported multiple times but it was addressed when Bashiruddin Mahmood claimed to invent a scientific instrument to prevent further leakages.See: SBM Detection Instrument On 18 October 2011, a seven-hour emergency was imposed by the NES (manager of the plant) after detecting a heavy water leak from a feeder pipe to the reactor during a routine maintenance shut down. The emergency was lifted seven hours later, after the leak was reportedly brought under control. Despite incidents of power outages, the senior physicists and the management of the nuclear power plant has dismissed the criticism of the operations of the nuclear power plant who maintained that the power plant had to be run without Canada's technical and material support, and facilities which were nonexistence in the country to support the operations of the plant. The welding facility, tool manufacturing, and machine shops near the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant were eventually established by Parvez Butt (a mechanical engineer) to support the nuclear power operations of the plant in successive years‚Äî Butt was honored with nation's highest honor for this contribution. According to report submitted to IAEA by S.B. Hussain, a senior physicist who worked at Karachi Nuclear Power Plant, maintained that operating nuclear power plant in the environment of complete Canadian absence was a difficult task, but proved a blessing in disguise, because it provided the Atomic Energy Commission an opportunity to engage in self-reliance in producing nuclear fuel cycle and self-manufacturing programs that was pivotal experience in safely running and managing the much larger Chashma Nuclear Power Plant in Punjab.

Levinson, centers on the notion of politeness, construed as efforts on redressing the affronts to a person's self-esteems of effectively claiming positive social values in social interactions. Such self-esteem is referred as the sociological concept of face (as in \\"save face\\" or \\"lose face\\") to discuss politeness as a response to mitigate or avoid face-threatening acts such as requests or insults. Notable components in the framework of the theory include positive and negative faces, face threatening act (FTA), strategies for doing FTAs and factors influencing the choices of strategies; each described below. Among the studies of politeness in a variety of cultures for many years, Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson's politeness theory has become very influential. Though Brown and Levinson proposed their model as universally applicable, their theory has been challenged by other scholars in varied aspects such as its cross-cultural applicability or ways to interpret and conceptualize politeness.Mills, Sara. 2003. Gender and Politeness. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  Positive and negative face  The concept of face was derived from Chinese into English in the 19th century. ‚ÄúFace‚Äù conceptualized as an individual‚Äôs positive claim of social values in socializing contact was introduced into academia by Erving Goffman through his theories of \\"face\\" and \\"facework\\". According to Brown and Levinson's assumption in politeness theory based on Goffman's ‚Äúface‚Äù, one's face is categorized into two forms: positive and negative. Brown and Levinson defined positive face two ways: as \\"the want of every member that his wants be desirable to at least some others executors\\" (p. 62), or alternatively, \\"the positive consistent self-image or 'personality' (crucially including the desire that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactants\\" (p. 61). Negative face was defined as \\"the want of every 'competent adult member' that his actions be unimpeded by others\\", or \\"the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, rights to non-distraction‚Äîi.e. the freedom of action and freedom from imposition\\".Brown, Penelope and Stephen C. Levinson. 1987. Politeness: Some universals in language usage. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Whereas positive face involves a desire for connection with others, negative face needs include autonomy and independence. Ten years later, Brown characterized positive face by desires to be liked, admired, ratified, and related to positively, noting that one would threaten positive face by ignoring someone. At the same time, she characterized negative face by the desire not to be imposed upon, noting that negative face could be impinged upon by imposing on someone.Coates, Jennifer. 1998. Language and Gender: A Reader. Wiley- Blackwell. Positive face refers to one's self-esteem, while negative face refers to one's freedom to act.Foley, William. 1997. Anthropological Linguistics: An introduction. Blackwell. These two aspects of face are the basic wants in any social interaction; during any social interaction, cooperation is needed amongst the participants to maintain each other's face. Participants can do this by using positive politeness and negative politeness, which pay attention to people's positive and negative face needs respectively.  Face-threatening acts  According to Brown and Levinson, positive and negative face exist universally in human culture; it has been argued that the notion of face is the actual universal component to their proposed politeness theory. A face threatening act is an act that inherently damages the face of the addressee or the speaker by acting in opposition to the wants and desires of the other. Face threatening acts can be verbal (using words/language), paraverbal (conveyed in the characteristics of speech such as tone, inflection, etc.), or non-verbal (facial expression, etc.). Based on the terms of conversation in social interactions, face-threatening acts are at times inevitable. At minimum, there must be at least one of the face threatening acts associated with an utterance. It is also possible to have multiple acts working within a single utterance. = Negative face-threatening acts = Negative face is threatened when an individual does not avoid or intend to avoid the obstruction of their interlocutor's freedom of action. It can cause damage to either the speaker or the hearer, and makes one of the interlocutors submit their will to the other. Freedom of choice and action are impeded when negative face is threatened.  Damage to the hearer  :The following are cases in which the negative face of the hearer (the person being spoken to) is threatened. :*An act that affirms or denies a future act of the hearer creates pressure on the hearer to either perform or not perform the act. :::Examples: orders, requests, suggestions, advice, remindings, threats, or warnings. :*An act that expresses the speaker's sentiments of the hearer or the hearer's belongings. :::Examples: compliments, expressions of envy or admiration, or expressions of strong negative emotion toward the hearer (e.g. hatred, anger, distrust). :*An act that expresses speaker‚Äôs future imposing of positive effects toward the hearer, as either rejection or acceptance put pressure on the hearer and may incur a debt. :::Examples: offers and promises.  Damage to the speaker  :The following are cases in which the negative face of the speaker (the person talking) is threatened. :*An act that speaker‚Äôs humbles his own face or accept debt to maintain hearer‚Äôs face and make good for the hearer. :: > Examples: expressing thanks, acceptance of gratitude or apology, excuse, > acceptance of offers, pretending unaware of H‚Äôs mistakes, committing do > something unfavorable. = Positive face-threatening acts = Positive face is threatened when the speaker or hearer does not care about their interactor's feelings, wants, or does not want what the other wants. Positive face threatening acts can also cause damage to the speaker or the hearer. When an individual is forced to be separated from others so that their well being is treated less importantly, positive face is threatened.  Damage to the hearer  :The following are cases in which the positive face of the hearer (the person being spoken to) is threatened. :*An act that expresses the speaker's negative assessment of the hearer's positive face or an element of his/her positive face. :::*The speaker directly or indirectly indicating that he dislike some aspect of the hearer's possessions, desires, or personal attributes. ::::Examples: disapproval, criticism, contempt or ridicule, complaints and reprimands, accusations, insults. :::: :::*The speaker expresses disapproval by stating or implying that the hearer is wrong, irrational, or misguided. ::::Examples: contradictions or disagreements, challenges. :*An act that expresses the speaker's indifference toward the addressee's positive face. ::*The addressee might be embarrassed for or fear the speaker. :::Examples: excessively emotional expressions. ::*The speaker indicates that he doesn't have the same values or fears as the hearer :::Examples: disrespect, mention of topics which are inappropriate in general or in the context. ::*The speaker indicates that he is willing to disregard the emotional well being of the hearer. :::Examples: belittling or boasting. ::*The speaker increases the possibility that a face-threatening act will occur. This situation is created when a topic is brought up by the speaker that is a sensitive societal subject. :::Examples: topics that relate to politics, race, religion. ::*The speaker indicates that he is indifferent to the positive face wants of the hearer. This is most often expressed in obvious non-cooperative behavior. :::Examples: interrupting, non sequiturs. ::*The speaker misidentifies the hearer in an offensive or embarrassing way. This may occur either accidentally or intentionally. Generally, this refers to the misuse of address terms in relation to status, gender, or age. :::Example: Addressing a young woman as \\"ma'am\\" instead of \\"miss.\\"  Damage to the speaker  :The following are cases in which the positive face of the speaker (the person talking) is threatened. :*An act that shows that the speaker is in some sense wrong, has own dignity offended, or unable to control himself. :::Examples: apologies, acceptance of compliment, inability to control one‚Äôs physical self, inability to control one‚Äôs emotional self, self-humiliation, confessions. = Refusals as threatening both positive and negative face = In their study of refusals to requests, Johnson et al. argue refusals can threaten both the positive and negative face of the refuser (the person who was asked a favor), and the positive face of the requester (the person asking for a favor). Obstacles, or reasons for non-compliance with a person's request, can \\"vary on three dimensions: willingness-unwillingness, ability-inability, and focus on-focus away from the requester\\". > The willingness dimension differentiates between refusals where the refuser > states, \\"I don't want to help you\\" and \\"I'd like to help.\\" Ability > differentiates between, \\"I'm short on cash\\" and \\"I have some extra money.\\" > Focus on-focus away from requester differentiates between, \\"It's your > problem, so you take care of it\\" and \\"It's terrible that your mom won't give > you the money.\\" When a person makes a request, their positive face is threatened mostly along the ability and unwillingness dimensions. People tend to make requests of \\"intimates,\\" people they are supposed to know well/have a good relationship with. Threat to the requester's positive face increases when the requester chooses a person who has low ability/inability to fulfill the request or is unwilling to comply (the person being asked has to refuse the request); choosing a person with low ability suggests the requester has poor relational knowledge. On the other hand, choosing a person with high ability decreases threat to the requester's positive face because it shows the requester's competence; choosing a person with high willingness reinforces the requester's choice and decreases threats to positive face. Choosing to refuse or not refuse a request can threaten the requester's positive and negative faces in different ways. When a person refuses to comply with a request from an intimate, they are violating relational expectations and increasing threat to their positive face; however, focusing attention away from the requester can decrease threat to the requester's positive face even if they are unwilling to help. In contrast, focusing attention on the requester can increase threat to positive face since it highlights the refuser's unwillingness. Accepting a request is the least threatening act. Threats to the refuser's negative face vary along the ability and focus dimensions. Focusing away from the requester allows the refuser to maintain their autonomy while maintaining the relationship; this leads to less face-threat if the refuser has high ability because they can choose whether to comply or not. Focusing on the requester would threaten their relationship with the requester and their long-term autonomy (the requester may be unwilling to comply to future requests when the roles are reversed); however, if the refuser has low ability, focusing on the requester can actually decrease threats to negative face by showing they are unable to comply even if they wanted to. *Note: the requester and refuser would be analogous to the \\"speaker\\" and \\"hearer\\" roles discussed earlier in the section \\"Face-threatening acts\\".  Politeness strategies  Politeness strategies are used to formulate messages in order to save the hearer's positive face when face-threatening acts are inevitable or desired. Brown and Levinson outline four main types of politeness strategies: bald on-record, negative politeness, positive politeness, and off-record (indirect) as well as simply not using the face-threatening act. = Bald on-record = Bald on- record strategy does not attempt to minimize the threat to the hearer's face, although there are ways that bald on-record politeness can be used in trying to minimize face-threatening acts implicitly, such as giving advice in a non- manipulative way. Often using such a strategy will shock or embarrass the addressee, and so this strategy is most often utilized in situations where the speaker has a close relationship with the listener, such as family or close friends. Brown and Levinson outline various cases in which one might use the bald on-record strategy, including:  Situations and Examples  :*Situations with no threat minimization ::*Urgency or desperation :::Watch out! ::*When efficiency is necessary :::Hear me out:... ::*Task-oriented :::Pass me the hammer. ::*Little or no desire to maintain someone's face :::Don't forget to clean the blinds! ::*Doing the face-threatening act is in the interest of the hearer :::Your headlights are on! :*Situations where the threat is minimized implicitly ::*Welcomes :::Come in. ::*Offers :::Leave it, I'll clean up later. :::Eat! = Positive politeness = Positive politeness strategies seek to minimize the threat to the hearer's positive face. These strategies are used to make the hearer feel good about themselves, their interests or possessions, and are most usually used in situations where the audience knows each other fairly well, or an individuals positive face needs, or self-worth, have to be met. In addition to hedging and attempts to avoid conflict, some strategies of positive politeness include statements of friendship, solidarity, compliments, and the following examples from Brown and Levinson:  Situations and Examples  * Attend to H's interests, needs, wants ::You look sad. Can I do anything? * Use solidarity in-group identity markers ::Heh, mate, can you lend me a dollar? ::'G√ºey, ¬øme haces un paro?'* ::*Translation: \\"Do a favor for me?\\" \\"G√ºey\\" can be an in-group solidarity marker, usually associated with certain regions of Mexico; literally meaning 'ox', it can be used to belittle someone and/or their intelligence. Therefore, you could only use it with friends without running the risk of a confrontation. To use it in-group, however, is an indication of friendship/solidarity, depending on intonation. * Be optimistic ::I'll just come along, if you don't mind. * Include both speaker (S) and hearer (H) in activity ::If we help each other, I guess, we'll both sink or swim in this course. * Offer or promise ::If you wash the dishes, I'll vacuum the floor. * Exaggerate interest in H and his interests ::That's a nice haircut you got; where did you get it? * Avoid Disagreement ::Yes, it's rather long; not short certainly. * Joke ::Wow, that's a whopper!  Other Purposes and Usages  Positive politeness strategies can also emerge in situations where the speakers do not know each other well. For example, Charlotte Rees and Lynn Knight have explored the role politeness theory plays in general practice consultations. They found that, in an effort to remain polite, patients agreed to the presence of a student observer during a general practice consultation even when the patient preferred a private consultation. Rees and Knight concluded that politeness strategies in the medical field can inhibit patients from providing complete and accurate information. Another use of positive politeness is polite or formal speech such as Japanese honorifics. Again, this type of formal speech can be used to protect the hearer's positive face. = Negative politeness = Negative politeness strategies are oriented towards the hearer's negative face and emphasize avoidance of imposition on the hearer. By attempting to avoid imposition from the speaker, the risk of face- threat to the hearer is reduced. These strategies presume that the speaker will be imposing on the listener and there is a higher potential for awkwardness or embarrassment than in bald on record strategies and positive politeness strategies. Examples from Brown and Levinson include:  Situations and Examples  * Be indirect ::Would you know where Oxford Street is? * Use hedges or questions ::Perhaps, he might have taken it, maybe. ::Could you please pass the rice? * Be pessimistic ::You couldn't find your way to lending me a thousand dollars, could you? ::So I suppose some help is out of the question, then? * Minimize the imposition ::It's not too much out of your way, just a couple of blocks. * Use obviating structures, like nominalizations, passives, or statements of general rules ::I hope offense will not be taken. ::Visitors sign the ledger. ::Spitting will not be tolerated. * Apologetic ::I'm sorry; it's a lot to ask, but can you lend me a thousand dollars? * Use plural pronouns ::We regret to inform you.  Three main stages of favor seeking  Favor seeking, or a speaker asking the hearer for a favor, is a common example of negative politeness strategies in use. Held observes three main stages in favor-seeking: the preparatory phase, the focal phase, and the final phase:Carter, Ronald and McCarthy, Michael. 1994. Language as Discourse- Perspectives for Language Teaching. Longman Publishing, New York. # The preparatory phase is when the favor-seeking is preceded by elaborate precautions against loss of face to both sides. It often involves signals of openings and markers to be used to clarify the situation (e.g. 'You see,' or 'so,'). The request is often softened, made less direct, and imposing (e.g. past continuous 'I was wondering'; informal tag 'What d'you reckon?). The speaker must also reduce his own self-importance in the matter and exaggerate the hearer's (down-scaling compliments). # The focal stage is subdivided into elements such as asker's reasons or constraints (e.g. 'I've tried everywhere but can't get one'), the other's face (e.g. 'You're the only person I can turn to'), and more. # The third stage is the final stage which consists of anticipatory thanks, promises, and compliments (e.g. 'I knew you would say yes. You're an angel.'). McCarthy and Carter provide an example of negative politeness using the following dialogue from the Australian television soap opera, \\"Neighbours\\": :Clarrie: So I said to him, forget your books for one night, throw a party next weekend. :Helen: A party at number 30! What will Dorothy say about that? :Clarrie: Well, what she doesn't know won't hurt her. Of course, I'll be keeping my eye on things, and (SIGNAL OF OPENING) that brings me to my next problem. (EXPLAIN PROBLEM) You see, these young people, they don't want an old codger like me poking my nose in, so I'll make myself scarce, but I still need to be closer to hand, you see. So, (ASK FAVOR) I was wondering, would it be all right if I came over here on the night? What d'you reckon? :Helen: Oh, Clarrie, I... :Clarrie: Oh (MINIMIZATION) I'd be no bother. (REINFORCE EXPLANATION) It'd mean a heck of a lot to those kids. :Helen: All right. :Clarrie: (THANK WITH BOOST) I knew you'd say yes. You're an angel, Helen. :Helen: Ha! (laughs) All of this is done in attempt to avoid imposition on the hearer. Negative politeness is concerned with proceeding towards a goal in the smoothest way and with sensitivity to one's interlocutors. In English, deference ('Excuse me, sir, could you please close the window') is associated with the avoidance or downplaying of an imposition; the more we feel we might be imposing, the more deferential we might be. It is clearly a strategy for negative politeness and the redressing of a threat to negative face, through actions such as favor-seeking. = Off-record (indirect) = The final politeness strategy outlined by Brown and Levinson is the indirect strategy; This strategy uses indirect language and removes the speaker from the potential to be imposing. The strategy of doing off-record to express something general or different than the speaker‚Äôs true meaning and relies on the hearer's interpretation to have the speaker's purpose get conveyed. The speaker can get credit for not imposing on the hearer or give the hearer a chance to be helpful and generous. This strategy relies heavily on pragmatics to convey the intended meaning while still utilizing the semantic meaning as a way to avoid losing face (see below in Choice of strategy).  Situations and Examples  *¬∑ Minimizing the threaten toward the hearer‚Äôs freedom (S-Speaker, H-Hearer) ::-S: Do you have a free chair over there? -H: Yes, I do. (grab the chair for the speaker) ::-S: Are you going out? -H: Yes, but I‚Äôll come home early. * Giving the hearer a chance to show good personality in caring for others ::-S: My head aches a lot. -H: Oh, I‚Äôll get some pain-killer pills for you.  Choice of strategy  Paul Grice argues that all conversationalists are rational beings who are primarily interested in the efficient conveying of messages.1975\\\\. \\"Logic and conversation\\". In Cole, P. and Morgan, J. (eds.) Syntax and semantics, vol 3. New York: Academic Press. Brown and Levinson use this argument in their politeness theory by saying that rational agents will choose the same politeness strategy as any other would under the same circumstances to try to mitigate face. They show the available range of verbal politeness strategies to redress loss of face. Face-threatening acts have the ability to mutually threaten face, therefore rational agents seek to avoid face-threatening acts or will try to use certain strategies to minimize the threat. In certain situations, an over application of any particular strategy may actually achieve the opposite of the intended effect, as \\"certain speakers consistently evaluate polite behavior as unnecessary and offensive.\\" Speaker (S) will weigh: # the want to communicate the content of the face-threatening act in question # the want to be efficient or urgent # the want to maintain H's face to any degree In most cooperative circumstances where 3. is greater than 2., S will want to minimize the face-threatening act. = Payoffs associated with each strategy = In deciding which strategy to use, the speaker runs through the individual payoffs of each strategy. * Bald on-record ::*enlists public pressure, puts H in the public eye if there are others present ::*S gets credit for honesty, outspokenness which avoids the danger of seeming manipulative, yet can come across as abrasive and tactless ::*S avoids danger of being misunderstood by putting intended meaning directly into utterance without the reliance upon the pragmatic meaning * Positive politeness ::*minimizes threatening aspect by assuring that S considers to be of the same kind with H, increasing the sense of solidarity and decreasing their social distance :::*criticism may lose much of its sting if done in a way that asserts mutual friendship ::*when S includes themself equally as a participant in the request or offer, it may lessen the potential for face-threatening act debt :::*Ex: a person says \\"Let's get on with dinner\\" to their spouse in front of the television: by using the first person plural of the imperative form of the verb, the speaker is able to include themself as a recipient of the order, just like the hearer, likewise increasing solidarity. * Negative politeness ::*Helps avoid future debt by keeping social distance and not getting too familiar with H ::*pays respect or deference by assuming that you may be intruding on the hearer in return for the face-threatening act. :::*Ex: \\"I don't mean to bother you, but can I ask a quick question?\\" * Off record ::*get credit for being tactful, non-coercive ::*avoid responsibility for the potentially face-damaging interpretation ::*give the addressee an opportunity to seem to care for S because it tests H's feelings towards S :::*If S wants H to close the window, he may say \\"It's cold in here.\\" If H answers \\"I'll go close the window\\" then he is responding to this potentially threatening act by giving a \\"gift\\" to the original speaker and therefore S avoids the potential threat of ordering H around and H gets credit for being generous or cooperative * Don't do the face-threatening act. ::*S avoids offending H at all ::*S also fails to achieve his desired communication ::*An example might be a physician avoiding bringing up the need for a patient to lose weight. = Sociological variables = Three sociological factors affect the choice of politeness strategy and the seriousness of the face threatening action: distance between speaker and listener; the power difference between the speaker and listener; and ranking of the seriousness of the face threat.Leech, Geoffrey. 1983.Principles of pragmatics. London: Longman #Social distance between parties (symmetric relation) #: Distinguishes kin or friend from a stranger with whom you may have the same social status, but who is still separate because of social distance. Different acts may be seen as face-threatening or non-face threatening depending on the social distance between speaker and listener #: #: Example: We may use less elaborate positive strategies or we may choose to use positive rather than negative politeness when speaking with family rather than a stranger #Power relations between parties (asymmetric relation) #: We are inclined to speak to our social equals differently than those whose status is higher or lower than our own in a given situation. #: #: Example: If a professor is working in her office and people are being very loud and disruptive in the next room, she will go over there and tell them to be quiet but the way she does it will differ depending on who it is. If they are students she will use the bald on-record strategy to make sure there is no confusion in what she is asking, saying: \\"Stop talking so loud!\\". #: But if they are colleagues she will claim common ground with them using the positive politeness strategy or frame an indirect request for them to stop talking, saying: \\"I'm working on a lecture and it's really hard to concentrate with all this noise.\\" #: Additionally if they are really high status directors of the department she may end up saying nothing at all or apologize for interrupting them, refraining from the face-threatening act. # The absolute ranking of the threat of the face-threatening act #: Some impositions are considered more serious than others. Highly imposing acts like requests demand more redress to mitigate their increased threat level. Overall the formula for the weight of a face-threatening act is: Weight = Social distance (speaker, hearer) + power difference (speaker, hearer) + rank of imposition = Hierarchy of strategies = The greater potential for loss of face requires greater redressive action. If the potential for loss of face is too great, the speaker may make the decision to abandon the face-threatening acts completely and say nothing. The number next to each strategy corresponds to the danger-level of the particular face-threatening act. The more dangerous the particular face-threatening act is, the more S will tend to use a higher numbered strategy. # No redressive action #: *Bald On-Record- leaves no way for H to minimize the face-threatening act. # Positive redressive action #: *S satisfies a wide range of H's desires not necessarily related to the face-threatening act. #: **Shows interest in H #: **Claims common ground with H #: **Seeks agreement #: **Gives sympathy # Negative redressive action #: *S satisfies H's desires to be unimpeded‚Äîthe want that is directly challenged by the face-threatening act. #: **Be conventionally indirect #: **Minimize imposition on H #: **Beg forgiveness #: **Give deference #: *This implies that the matter is important enough for S to disturb H # Off-Record #: *S has the opportunity to evade responsibility by claiming that H's interpretation of the utterance as a face-threatening act is wrong # Don't do the face-threatening act.  Application examples  Although the politeness theory originated from the curiosity of linguistics and language forming, scholars are beginning to see its other benefits: its ability to not only help with interpersonal relationships, workplace environments, and beyond. = Business world = One study by Cynthia Dunn observed a Japanese business that required etiquette training for their new employers. Employers were taught the company's definition of politeness; they were expected to incorporate these beliefs into their day-to-day behavior, such as \\"kindness,\\" \\"consideration for others,\\" and \\"deference and respect\\". However, self-presentation was also a critical feature employers wanted their employees to improve upon. An attractive self-presentation through various nonverbals and word choice would not only reflect the individual's politeness but the corporation's as well. This decision had very positive consequences in the workplace environment. Through new studies there is the possibility that the politeness theory may penetrate deeper areas. For example, maybe more businesses will begin to take on these concepts and incorporate them into their discussion and conflict-resolution strategies. These could be effective in achieving long-term goals. Whatever the case may be, the politeness theory has a solid foundation in the field of communication and will certainly contribute positively to the assimilation of language and civility. = Art world = In his 1967 work, Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior, Goffman posits numerous times that with every remark people make, they risk maintaining their face and the face of others. Politeness theory is generally applied when assessing speech acts or remarks. However, a study conducted by Jurgita Sribaitƒó looked at politeness theory as it applied to written art reviews. The study focused on art reviews in Lithuania in the early and mid-1970s and analyzed the different strategies used by the art reviewers as they attempted to critique pieces of art while maintaining their face as well as the face of the artists. The study was able to identify face-saving acts and all four politeness strategies at work. The author states, \\"Reviewers usually appear to have in mind the addressee's positive face (the desire to be liked and be approved of) as well as his negative face (the desire to be left free to act as he chooses).\\" The examples given show that even the reviewers, who hold the obvious advantage over the addressees, cared to save both their face and the face of the artists. = Humor = Positive politeness strategies are used as a way of giving someone a sense of belonging and as seen in the politeness strategies section, jokes are considered a positive politeness strategy. Therefore, joking can be a way of making someone feel as if though they belong. However, some contemporary researchers have noted that humor is complex and not all jokes can be considered polite. In fact, many instances of humor usage can negatively affect face for a number of reasons: the hearers ability to understand the joke is tested, the hearer may interpret verification of the willingness to hear a joke as aggressive, and the hearer can be threatened even by non aggressive humor if it tests their ability to understand the joke or their emotions. In a study conducted by Marta Dynel, in 2016, different occasions of humor used in the television show, House, were assessed and analyzed as polite or (im)polite. In reference to the conclusions of study Dynel states, \\"Specifically, humor may serve politeness and/or impoliteness depending on the speaker's intention and awareness of the consequences his/her utterance may carry, the hearer's recognition of the speaker's intention, as well as his/her ultimate amusement or taking offense.\\" In general, humor can provide face-saving tactics that enable solidarity, but it can also be a risky strategy to use because the speaker and the hearer must be on the same page. = Delivering bad news = When delivering bad news the speaker has a lot to consider regarding his or her own face and the face of the hearer. In 2015, Miroslav Sirota and Marie Juanchich conducted a study on uncertainty communication with negative outcomes. The authors suggest \\"First, speakers making a prediction may intend not only to inform about a probability level, but also to manage the hearer's faces or their own...Second, speakers perform face-managing intentions by altering (e.g. lessening or magnifying) the explicitly communicated probablility of a negative outcome...Thus, politeness theory posits that speakers use uncertainty quantifiers to pursue informative intentions and also to sugar-coat threatening news to manage the hearers' or their own faces.\\" The study conducted required people to communicate bad news to a friend regarding two scenarios. In the first scenario the subjects had to communicate a 50% probability that their friend's new car was going to break-down, and in the second scenario the subjects communicated a 50% chance that their friend's stock were going to lose their value. The subjects of the study reported that \\"speakers intended to manage hearer's faces from threatening news or to manage their own faces from being wrong‚Ä¶ speakers communicated an altered (in the case of our scenarios, lower) outcome probability when they intended to be tactful or cautious than when they intended to be informative.\\" In 2002, an oncologist by the name of Jerome Groopman wrote an article entitled, Dying Words; How should doctor's deliver bad news?. In his article he recalls one of the first experiences in which he had to tell a young woman that she has malignant terminal cancer. He said to her, \\"Claire, with this disease, a remission would ordinarily last three to six months. A person could expect to survive between one to two years.\\" He found that this type of strategy (bald on-record) deeply shook the patient (negatively threatened her negative face). He now uses different strategies and realized that with sensitive information tact must be used, but also that the patient must be aware of the true probability of negative outcome. Many doctors, he argues, do not find that balance and tend to hedge information, \\"More than forty percent of oncologists withhold a prognosis from a patient if he or she does not ask for it or if the family requests that the patient not be told. A similar number speak in euphemisms, skirting the truth.\\" This statement reads similarly to the Sirota and Juanchich study; bad news is very frequently sugar-coated in attempt to save face. = Mitigated speech = In his book, Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a chapter entitled, \\"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes.\\" The chapter attempts to explain why so many planes that crash end up crashing from human error, and not mechanical issues. One of the most prominent reasons, Gladwell points out, is the lack of effective communication due to the power dynamic between the captain and the first officer. He uses numerous examples of black box recordings in which the first officer hints at a problem instead of addressing it outright. He introduces the linguistic term, mitigated speech, and states, \\"We mitigate when we're being polite, or when we're ashamed or embarrassed, or when we're being deferential to authority.\\" First officers tend to use mitigated speech when addressing their captain and this has caused plane crashes in the past. Linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu conducted a study with a group of captains and first officers. They gave them a scenario in which they had to communicate to each other the need to change course to avoid a thunderstorm. Overwhelmingly the captains used commands, or what Brown and Levinson would consider bald on-record politeness strategy, to communicate with their first officer. On the other hand, the first officers only used hints, similar to what politeness theory would consider an off-record politeness strategy, to communicate with their superior, the captain. Airlines have been taking this issue seriously and have made strides in teaching captains and first officers how to communicate with each other effectively. = Intercultural Communication = Various researches have analyzed the application of politeness theory in communication between different cultural groups. Communicative expectations, patterns of communicative activities and choice of politeness strategies vary among cultures. For instance, Morisaki and Gudykunst argue that members from individualist cultures prefer to use negative politeness strategies in conflict management, while members from collectivist cultures would rather use positive politeness strategies. 12 In addition, some other researchers focused on the acquaintance of politeness strategies and knowledge about politeness difference in foreign language education. Japanese researcher Kawai found that there is a lack of ‚Äúcultural learning‚Äù in English education makes the Japanese student weak in effectively use politeness strategies in English, such as the reliance on context understanding in Japanese may cause face-threatening acts when in inter-cultural communication with western cultures. Tanaka and Kawade found differences in the usage pattern of politeness strategies among native English speakers and ESL learners.  Critiques  Brown and Levinson's politeness theory is very applicable not only in the area of study within the communication field but also helpful in guiding individuals in ways to improve their speech and actions Two qualities in particular stand out: # Good Heuristic Value: This theory has motivated scholars to implement more research into grasping these ideas or finding alternatives to this way of thinking. # Broad Scope: This theory considers factors that play a role in the field of communication such as \\"language, identity, relational definition ... social power, distance, and culture\\". On the other hand, Although Brown and Levinson's theory is widely applicable, some weaknesses in their theory have been noted. = Cultural Differences = Many academics have critiqued that many cultures use politeness strategies differently than how Brown and Levinson theorized. Many sociologists criticize that politeness theory is heavily based on Western cultures where individualism is highly valued compared to many non-Western cultures where group identity is valued over the individual. Some of this intracultural difference is, in part, due to diverse \\"knowledge and values\\" within a particular society, but Brown and Levinson argue that their theory is universal. Although everyone has face wants, there are different ways strategies they use to accomplish these wants or mitigate face threats based on their culture. For example, negative politeness is the norm in some cultures (Japan and Britain) but not others that prefer positive politeness (Australia) and some cultures use politeness strategies when there is no face threat, such as the Japanese honorific system. Ide et al. shows that the roughly equivalent term in Japanese, teneina, has different sets of connotations associated with it from the English term \\"politeness\\". Gu (1998) pointed out that some face concerns in Western culture are not taken into account in Eastern cultures. In a series of interviews conducted by Blum-Kulka, House and Kasper in 1989 of fifty-two Israeli families, they conclude that as suggested already by the semantic definitions offered for the term \\"politeness\\" by Israelis, the constituents of \\"tact\\" and its appropriate modes of expression are very much subject to cultural interpretation.Blum-Kulka, Shoshana. \\"The metapragmatics of politeness in Israeli society.\\" (n.d.): Rpt. in Politeness in Language: Studies in Its History, Theory, and Practice. Ed. Richard J. Watts, Sachiko Ide, and Konrad Ehlich. New York: De Gruyter Mouton, 2005. 255-280. Ebrary. Web. 16 June 2016. = Inclusiveness of Politeness Strategies = Some claim that a few of these techniques may be used in more than one type of situation or more than one at a time. Additionally, a given speech act (of any politeness strategy) can have multiple consequences, rather than affecting only positive face or negative face as the current theory suggests. = Nonverbal Aspects of Communication = Sometimes nonverbal actions speak louder than verbal communication and might alter how the politeness strategy is interpreted or which politeness strategy is used. = Sequence of the Order of Actions = . = Individual Differences = An individual may have a pattern or way of communicating that they have habitually used in the past that others may consider face threatening or vice versa. Mood may also drive how they choose to respond to a situation regardless of politeness strategies. = Issues with Terminology and their Definitions = Various definitions of 'politeness' which make reference to considering others' feelings, establishing levels of mutual comfort, and promoting rapport have been found to be lacking, in that often whether a verbal act is face threatening or not depends upon preemptively knowing how the hearer will interpret it. This view shifts the focus from predominantly upon the speaker to upon both speaker and hearer, implying that politeness is socially constructed and therefore not universal, requiring cross-cultural examination. Additionally, a distinction has been made between first- and second-order politeness, due to the appropriation of an English word for a scientific concept: first-order politeness \\"correspond[s] to the various ways in which polite behavior is perceived and talked about by members of socio-cultural groups\\", meaning the connotation of 'politeness' for those not studying it, and second-order politeness is \\"a theoretical construct, a term within a theory of social behavior and language usage\\", meaning the scientific application of the term. Spencer-Oatey argues that sociality rights also plays a role in relationship management other than ‚Äúface‚Äù, and Browna and Levinson‚Äôs ‚Äúnegative face‚Äù is not about face concerns but should be conceptualized into sociality rights. Watts (2003) argues that \\"it is impossible to evaluate (im) politeness behaviour out of the context of real, ongoing verbal interaction\\" and also \\"social interaction is negotiated on-line.\\" = Hierarchy politeness = Scholars suggest power differences vary between strangers and acquaintances, which in turn, shape the effects of the politeness strategies. Social similarity and intimacy are other aspects to consider, as these connections create an increased awareness of the other person's meaning and request and therefore minimize the face-threatening act. In 1964, socio-psychologist Edward E. Jones wrote a book on ingratiation and defines it as \\"a class of strategic behaviors illicitly designed to influence a particular other person concerning the attractiveness of one's personal qualities.\\" The concept of ingratiation has helped spur further investigation into how its power dynamics play into Brown and Levinson's politeness theory. The claim has been made that Brown and Levinson's theory does not take into account the effect unique dynamic power relations and rankings has on the way people interact with one another (i.e. ingratiation). An article written by Akio Yabuuchi argues a case for a new trichotomous politeness system to replace politeness theory's dichotomous politeness system; hierarchy politeness The proposed system is made up of fellowship politeness (similar to Brown and Levinson's positive politeness), autonomy politeness (similar to Brown and Levinson's negative politeness), and hierarchy politeness. Hierarchy politeness recognizes ingratiation as a way to communicate within power dynamics.

History Agriculture played such an important part in Uruguayan history and national identity until the middle of the 20th century that the entire country was then sometimes likened to a single huge estancia (agricultural estate) with Montevideo, where the wealth generated in the hinterland was spent, as its casco or administrative head. As another saying went, \\"Uruguay es la vaca y el puerto\\" (\\"Uruguay is the cow and the port\\"). However, when world market prices for Uruguay‚Äôs main export commodities like beef and wool fell drastically in the 1950s, the country's prosperous golden era came to an end. Production In 2018, the country produced 1.36 million tons of rice, 1.33 million tons of soy, 816 thousand tons of maize, 637 thousand tons of barley, 440 thousand tons of wheat, 350 thousand tons of sugar cane, 106 thousand tons of orange, 104 thousand tons of grape, 90 thousand tons of rapeseed, 87 thousand tons of potato, 76 thousand tons of sorghum, 71 thousand tons of tangerine, 52 thousand tons of oats, 48 thousand tons of apple, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products.Uruguay production in 2018, by FAO Uruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tons of beef. Uruguay production in 2018, by FAO Contemporary agricultural contribution to Uruguayan economy Today, agriculture still contributes roughly 10% to the country‚Äôs GDP and is the main foreign exchange earner, putting Uruguay in line with other agricultural exporters like Brazil, Canada and New Zealand. Uruguay is a member of the Cairns Group of exporters of agricultural products.

The games were released for numerous platforms, with the Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega CD versions published by Sega while the Super NES version was published by Konami (who also produced an earlier Game Boy video game based on the show). Super NES version The Super NES version is developed and published by Konami. Each level consists of an episode that is loosely based on those from the animated series, taking Batman to an amusement park and other places where supercriminals do their work. The soundtrack was written by Konami Kukeiha Club members Kazuhiko Uehara, Harumi Ueko, Jun Funahashi, Masanari Iwata, Masahiko Kimura, Kayo Fujitani, and Masahiro Ikariko. The Joker is the first villain in the SNES version of The Adventures of Batman & Robin. =Gameplay= For the most part, it is an action-adventure platformer in which the player controls Batman, and follows him to the end of each stage, where a villain is set to appear. Some of the more common features in the game is the possibility to equip with different gadgets, such as bombs and x-ray lenses. The gadgets are in some cases essential to complete some stages. The player can return to the Batcave in order to re-equip the gadgets and restart a stage with all the lives accumulated up to that point (in case the player had lost lives). The game features passwords, which leaves the player in the last played stage. The passwords also take count of the number of lives remaining and the continues used. Passwords cannot be used in hard difficulty, which means that the game must be completed from the beginning. Completion of the hard mode rewards the player with a special ending. Genesis version The Genesis version, developed by Clockwork Tortoise and published by Sega, is a run 'n' gun where both Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze, who plans to freeze Gotham City. In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two- Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair. The game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shuriken in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings. The Genesis version of the game was released on August 2, 1995. The game features a dark electronica-styled soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. Sega CD version The Sega CD version, also developed by Clockwork Tortoise and published by Sega, consists of chase screens with the Batmobile and Batplane. Between levels, the story advances through animated cutscenes that were created specifically for the game. The animated cutscenes were produced by Warner Bros. Animation (with animation by Tokyo Movie Shinsha, which also animated some of the episodes of the original cartoon). Kevin Conroy (Batman), Loren Lester (Robin), Robert Hastings (Commissioner James Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Harvey Bullock), Diane Pershing (Poison Ivy), John Glover (the Riddler), Arleen Sorkin (Harley Quinn), Mark Hamill (the Joker), John Vernon (Rupert Thorne) and Ron Perlman (Clayface) all reprised their roles from the animated series. The animated segments (about seventeen minutes in total) in the video game for the Sega CD are sometimes referred to as \\"The Lost Episode\\" of the series. Game Gear version The Game Gear version was developed by Novotrade and published by Sega. The Joker has assembled a gang of old Batman foes and kidnapped Robin, and the Batman has to go save him. There are four different levels, each with 2 or 3 stages, where Batman runs around beating up thugs and jumping between platforms before taking on a boss. Each stage ends with a boss encounter - some generic machine or thug in the early stages, and a classic Batman villain at the final stage of the level. The four levels takes Batman through a theater where he takes on the Mad Hatter, a frozen office building where he takes on Mr. Freeze, a graveyard where he takes on the Scarecrow, and finally an amusement park where he takes on Harley and the Joker. Batman typically fights with projectile attacks - he has an unlimited supply of batarangs, but can pick up other weapons with limited ammunition in small item boxes along the way. They're all more powerful than the batarangs. Once Batman gets close to an enemy, he will switch to melee attacks, which deal more damage than the projectiles. Batman can make several types of jumps, both upwards and sideways. Pressing the jump button twice does a double jump. Batman starts out with 9 extra lives, and instantly respawns where he died after losing one, with a full health bar, all ammunition intact, and all inflicted damage and defeated enemies accounted for. There are also multiple extra lives and life bar refill items spread around on the stages. The game has infinite continues and a password system, allowing the player to start over from any previously reached stage. The only punishment for having to continue is that the player's score is reset to zero, encouraging full playthroughs without continuing. Reception Reviewing the Super NES version, GamePros Bacon praised the game's often brain-teasing challenges, strong graphics and sound effects, and \\"eerie atmosphere\\". Though he criticized the fact that Robin appears only in cutscenes, the \\"vapid\\" dialogue, and the poor graphics and controls of the Batmobile stages, he concluded \\"The tame fighting and intricate challenges in The Adventures of Batman and Robin should please thoughtful action/adventure fans. But its beautiful graphics and supernatural sounds will impress anyone.\\" Nintendo Power also criticised the game for not giving Robin a more active role (although the game was actually under development before the series was retitled between seasons). Next Generation reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Unfortunately, the game's diverse play is flawed by a slow-moving character that can make it difficult to pull off quick jumps or attacks. In addition, the wildly varying difficulty levels often leave the game way too easy or frustratingly hard.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation gave the Genesis version one out of five stars, citing its generic side-scrolling platform gameplay and failure to recreate the look of the TV show. Scary Larry of GamePro called the Genesis version \\"a standard side-scrolling platform game with great backgrounds from the show but mediocre action\\", citing tedious and overly difficult level design, unresponsive controls, poor character visuals, and repetitive music. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 6.875 out of 10, remarking that the graphics and sounds are excellent, but the action is simplistic, repetitive, and overly difficult due to the large numbers of enemies attacking all at once. While noting that it has a more diverse selection of weapons than the Genesis version, Scary Larry said that the Game Gear version is likewise \\"predictable side-scrolling action.\\" He also criticized the music as \\"annoying and repetitive.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 6.375 out of 10. They said it has good cartoon-style graphics and level design, but that the screen blurs when moving and enemies frequently fire bullets from off-screen which the player has no time to react to, both of which make the game unfairly difficult. Al Manuel went so far as to say that it was \\"probably the hardest game I have ever played.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that while the FMV cutscenes in the Sega CD version are entertaining, the gameplay is repetitive and frustrating due to trees and other objects blocking the player's view of the road. One of them summarized the game as \\"a CD full of cartoon episodes with a so-so driving game included to break up the animated sequences.\\" They gave it a 6.5 out of 10. Tommy Glide of GamePro particularly criticized the lack of variety in the gameplay, commenting that \\"This barely average driving game should be called The Adventures of the Batmobile\\". A reviewer for Next Generation likewise regarded the rudimentary and repetitive gameplay to be the game's main flaw. Calling it \\"a journey into sheer tedium, boring yet frustrating at the same time\\", he scored it two out of five stars.

This mansion has been described as \\"one of the finest examples of Georgian Colonial architecture in this part of the country. It was used by Continental troops during the 1777 Philadelphia Campaign during the American Revolution. History Originally named \\"Whitemarsh Estate,\\" Hope Lodge is a Georgian country mansion built between 1743 and 1748 by Quaker businessman Samuel Morris and designed by Philadelphia architect Edmund Woolley. The Pennsylvania guide noted in 1940 that Morris' English fianc√©e--for whom the Lodge was allegedly built--broke off the engagement after hearing that \\"Morris, in his cups, remarked: 'I have built the pen, now all I have to do is to go to England, get the sow, and start the litter.' He died a bachelor, leaving the estate to his brother Joshua.\\" Upon Morris's death in 1770, his brother Joshua sold the property to William West, another Philadelphia merchant. During the autumn of 1777, Washington's Continental Army spent six weeks camped at nearby Whitemarsh. During the encampment, Hope Lodge was used as a hospital by George Washington's surgeon general John Cochran, and as quarters for Major General Nathanael Greene. When West died in 1784, the house was purchased by the English banker Henry Hope (to whom Adam Smith dedicated The Wealth of Nations and whose family would later own and lend their name to the Hope Diamond) and it was presented as a wedding gift to his ward, James Watmough. In 1832, the Watmough family sold the property to Jacob Wentz, their tenant farmer, and the Wentz family remained in residence at Hope Lodge for ninety years. In 1921, the property was sold to Keasbey and Mattison Company, who intended to demolish the home to expand a nearby limestone quarry. Hope Lodge was saved from destruction by William and Alice Degn, who purchased the property from Keasbey and Mattison in 1922. In 1957, ownership of the lodge was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Hope Lodge is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Mather Mill is part of the Hope Lodge property, but is not open due to structural reasons. Hope Lodge (2006) Hope Lodge today Hope Lodge was operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission as a museum and historic site. On November 20, 2009, the site was closed due to state budget constraints which reduced the agency's budget by 43%. This reduction resulted in mass layoff of PHMC employees, and the closure or reduction in hours and/or services at many PHMC-operated sites throughout the state of Pennsylvania. The site plays host to various community events, such as Ambler Symphony concerts; as well as an annual reenactment of the 1777 Whitemarsh Encampment. Tours of the interior of the building are available seasonally (April through October).

It was founded on May 3, 1852, as the United States as the National Typographical Union, and changed its name to the International Typographical Union at its Albany, New York, convention in 1869 after it began organizing members in Canada. The ITU was one of the first unions to admit female members, admitting women members such as Augusta Lewis, Mary Moore and Eva Howard in 1869. Typographers were educated, economically mobile, in every major urban center with newspapers, and had the unique possibility to influence publicity in favour of their cause. This led the union to the forefront of improving working conditions. ITU President W. B. Prescott led the ITU in 1897 to win a 48-hour work week and a standard wage scale for all printers. During the Great Depression, the ITU introduced the 40-hour work week across the industry at no cost to employers as a way to share the fewer jobs available. That ITU initiative spread to other unions and has since been codified across the labor sector by federal legislation in the U.S. establishing the 40-hour work week. The ITU had a unique system of factional opposition in its democratic elections, documented by Seymour Martin Lipset in his co-authored book Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union (1957).S. M. Lipset, Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union (1957) The local scale committees worked for a decent wage while the executive council sent ITU representatives to assist local unions in contract negotiations. All contracts had to be approved and ratified by both the Executive Council and the newspaper publisher. For most of its history, the ITU benefited from friendly and strong competition between Independents and Progressives for control of the union. As the work of typographers declined with automation, computers and mechanization of the print media, the ITU was disbanded. In 1986, a majority of ITU mailers voted to merge with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the remaining typographers joined the Communications Workers of America. Before its dissolution, the ITU was the oldest union in the United States. History =Formation= The concept for a typographical union was formed at a New York City meeting of 18 representatives from typographers' associations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Kentucky in December 1850. A committee led by John Keyser of Philadelphia was formed to investigate issues and propose a plan of action. The representatives met again in Baltimore in September 1851. While they resolved to form a national union, no other actions were taken. Finally, delegates from typographers' unions in 14 cities met in Cincinnati in May 1852 and organized the National Typographical Union. A random drawing enabled the Indianapolis local to become Local Union #1 and the new headquarters. In 1869, a new Constitution was adopted, accepting the affiliation of Canadian printing trade unions and changing the name to the International Typographical Union. In 1873, at Montreal, Canada, the first ITU convention outside the United States was held. The ITU Book of Laws would be amended many times, yet it was as members called it \\"ITU Law.\\" Each union shop was a \\"Chapel\\" and the shop steward was the \\"Chapel Chairman\\". All apprentices and journeymen had to have working cards showing paid union dues. ITU Law dictated that dues, which were proportionate to the amount of work done in the chapel, had to be paid by the first Tuesday after the last Saturday of the month. If the Union dues were not paid, the member was not allowed to work until their payment. =Fragmentation= The International Brotherhood of Bookbinders in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1908 Technological developments in the late 19th century such as the development of lithography and photography led to diversification and specialization among printers. Further fragmentation in the printing labor movement led to the establishment of the International Printing Pressmen Union of North America (IPPU), in 1889. In 1892, the ITU authorized membership for mailers and for newspaper writers. Pressure mounted for a separate pressman's union, and in 1892 the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) was formed. Many pressmen left the ITU for the Bookbinders. At the same time as mailers joined, two thousand pressmen members seceded to form the International Printing Pressmen Union Assistants, (IPPUA) in 1897 and the International Stereotypers' and Electroplaters' Union, (IS&EU;) in 1902. At the start of the 20th Century, ITU membership was primarily compositors and mailers. In 1894, the Louisville convention sought to have president W. B. Prescott examine ways to have newer technology under the ITU. Then, the ITU chartered a photoengravers' union in New York City. Over the next few years, the ITU organized photoengravers in several other cities as well. However, many photoengravers felt that the leaders of the ITU were indifferent to their needs. In 1899, photoengravers in New York City went on strike to demand a 48-hour work week. ITU President S. B. Donnelly refused to support the local, fearing employers might retaliate. The New York City photoengravers won their strike, but the lack of ITU support led most of the union's photoengraver locals to seek disaffiliation. A national convention in Philadelphia in November 1900 saw the photoengravers leaving the ITU and establishing the International Photo-Engravers' Union of North America. ITU President James M. Lynch, pressured the AFL into refusing to recognize the photoengravers' union until May 1904. In 1893, the ITU struck Harrison Gray Otis's Los Angeles Times. In 1896, the union began a boycott that ran until 1908. In 1903, ITU President James M. Lynch, persuaded William Randolph Hearst to start a rival paper, the Los Angeles Examiner. On October 1, 1910, James B. Mc Namara, an ITU member and his brother. Joseph J. Mc Namara, secretary-treasurer of the International Union of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers placed a bomb in the L.A. Times building, killing 21 people. Famed attorney Clarence Darrow defended the brothers. They were convicted of the bombing and murder. Despite various job actions that lasted into the 1920s, the L.A. Times remained a non-union shop. This was a major defeat for both the ITU and other trade unions; Los Angeles and Southern California would be lost to trade unions except in the case of the entertainment industry. =AFL= As early as 1879, the International Typographical Union was in the forefront of organized labor. The ITU was instrumental in the formation of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions in 1882. In the same time frame, the ITU rejected the Knights of Labor. In the American Federation of Labor (AFL) presidential election of 1881, William H. Foster of the ITU defeated Samuel Gompers. In 1886, the Cigar Makers' Union leader, Samuel Gompers, was elected AFL president. The ITU was the largest and strongest union in the AFL. By the end of the 19th century, ITU President S. B. Donnelly called the ITU the \\"strongest and most stable printing union in the United States\\". In 1924, William Green would succeed Gompers as AFL president. The seeds of discord between the AFL and ITU were sown. =Fight for better working conditions= International Typographical Union exhibit at the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition, Seattle, 1909 From October 1891, the ITU Mortuary Benefits were the most respected in trade unionism. In 1906, ITU President James M. Lynch decided to use strong tactics and initiated strikes in most major cities, attempting to secure an eight-hour work day. The union had lost a fight for a nine-hour day a few years earlier; however, this time, the union spent over US$4 million supporting its striking locals. Not only did the ITU win an eight-hour work day, but the ITU strike paved the way for similar gains by the five other printing unions. The ITU was a democratic labor union. Members served a five-year apprenticeship and were tested to become journeymen. The Progressives and Independents gave the union a two-party organization. The Progressive party gave most of the leaders to the ITU. In 1907, ITU President James M. Lynch appointed a special committee, \\"to formulate some system for the technical trade education of our members and apprentices.\\" The committee selected, and President Lynch accepted, the ITU Course of Instruction: thirty-six \\"Lessons in Printing\\". Courses were first offered to members of Chicago Typographical #16 by The Inland Printer Technical School of Chicago. Alumni would include future ITU presidents, Woodruff Randolph and John J. Pilch. In 1914, ITU President James M. Lynch resigned, appointed by Governor Martin H. Glynn as New York State Commissioner of Labor. Many printers in the New York \\"Big 6\\" Local, saw the political appointment, a way to remove Lynch from dealing with newspaper publishers. James M. Lynch would serve as ITU president 1925‚Äì1926. Employers sought concessions after World War I as part of their 'open shop' movement. A key goal was to lengthen the work day to 10 to 12 hours. The wartime ITU president Marsden G. Scott fought back with massive strikes all over the country. In one period (May to December 1921), new ITU president John McParland could say the defense fund was secure as the union collected over $6 million in strike donations and spent $5.5 million in strike benefits. By June 1924, employers had had enough. The three-year running battle with the union had cost owners dearly and the union preserved its gains. However, the win was one that had cost the health of ITU president, John McParland, who served from 1921‚Äì1923. Charles P. Howard served out the rest of 1923 as ITU president; being elected in 1924 and serving until 1938. =ITU role in forming the CIO= The ITU had been active in organizing new workers for almost 80 years. As the Great Depression created a crisis for American workers, the ITU joined with other unions in the AFL to agitate for more organizing. In 1935, Charles P. Howard, president of the ITU, joined with John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers; David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Thomas McMahon of the United Textile Workers; John Sheridan of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers; Harvey Fremming of the Oil Workers Union and Max Zaritsky of the Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers to form the Committee for Industrial Organization within the AFL. In 1937, ITU Secretary Randolph was livid at AFL President William Green. The AFL executive council levied an assessment to fight industrial organization upon allied unions. The ITU refused to pay; Randolph's reason was \\"not to pay any assessment levied by any means other than a referendum vote of ITU printers and mailers.\\" The craft unions within the AFL demanded that the committee stop organizing members on an industrial basis. Lewis and the other members of the CIO persisted. In 1938, the AFL ejected the eight member unions of the CIO, including the ITU. At the 1938, ITU convention at Birmingham, Alabama, President Claude M. Baker disclosed to the delegates the decision of the AFL. Three unions returned to the AFL. On May 21, 1941, the ITU turned down reaffiliation with the AFL by referendum vote of the ITU members. In 1944, the ITU reaffiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The AFL promised the ITU full autonomy. ITU President Woodruff Randolph and AFL President William Green re-established and re- affirmed the ITU-AFL relationship, as if no breach had taken place. The five remaining unions subsequently formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The CIO rejoined the AFL in 1955, forming the new entity known as the AFL‚ÄìCIO. AFL‚ÄìCIO President George Meany and his successors would have a cool relationship with all ITU presidents from Randolph to Bingle. ITU President Joe Bingle asked AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland to speak at the 1983 San Francisco ITU Convention; Kirkland declined. =Woodruff Randolph= Woodruff Randolph (1892‚Äì1966), a printer from Chicago #16 and attorney-at-law, served as ITU Secretary-Treasurer (1929‚Äì1944) and ITU President (1944‚Äì1957). Randolph was very powerful and often usurped the position of ITU president Claude M. Baker. The ITU presidential election of 1944 between Baker and Randolph was one of the most vicious in union history. He loathed the National Labor Relations Board. During World War II, Randolph dealt with the National War Labor Board. He led the Progressive party of the ITU. At the 1949 Oakland ITU convention, he spoke in harsh terms against the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act, the act in favor of the open shop. Chicago #16, Randolph's home local, was the first local hit by Taft-Hartley. On November 24, 1947 the Chicago papers went on a strike that lasted 22 months. Newspaper publishers called for aid from the authors of the law, U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft (R.-Ohio) and Congressman Fred A. Hartley, Jr. (R.-New Jersey) The ITU and Woodruff Randolph won in Chicago. He fought publishers and won in the early 1950s. In 1951, Randolph created Unitypo, the union-supported newspaper in struck cities. Unitypo met with mixed results from the public at large. In the mid-1950s, Randolph embodied the ITU; his power was felt in every ITU shop and feared in every newspaper's board room. The printers were shocked during the 1957 ITU convention in New York to find that Randolph would not seek reelection. Woodruff Randolph hand- picked the Progressives to run for executive council in 1958, which would control the ITU for nearly twenty years. At the same time United States Senator John McClellan (D.-AR) was investigating organized crime in labor unions. When Dave Beck, president of the Teamsters, resigned in 1957‚Äînear the time of Randolph's statement of retirement‚Äîmany ITU members wondered about their long-time leader. The new ITU President Elmer Brown meekly appeared before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management. Brown had been ITU second Vice-President (1944‚Äì1949) and had served in various offices in his home local, New York Typographical #6 (1945‚Äì1957). Brown claimed that during the 1957 ITU convention, Randolph requested Brown run for president of the ITU. Brown told the committee that he had not been aware of events in Indianapolis since he left the Executive Council. Randolph retired to his homes in Indiana and Florida, October 1, 1966, he died in the Union Printers Home. =Printing decline= Woodruff Randolph's hand-picked Progressive Executive Council held the longest tenure as a unit in ITU history: from 1958-1978, its membership was Elmer Brown, president; John J. Pilch, first vice-president; Alexander Sandy Bevis, second vice-president (Canadian); Joseph P. Bailey, third vice-president (Mailer). Secretary-treasurer Don Hurd died in 1959, succeeded by William R. Cloud. After Elmer Brown's 1968 death, the ITU presidents were Pilch (1968‚Äì1973) and Bevis (1974‚Äì1978). The Mergenthaler linotype machine was used by newspaper printers from the 1880s to the 1970s. Technological progress again confronted the ITU in the post-war period. A number of new advances‚Äîincluding offset lithography, flexography, relief print, screen printing, rotogravure, and digital printing‚Äîgreatly reduced the number of workers needed in the modern printshop and newspaper composing room. In 1964, the ITU counted 121,858 members. But by 1980, the union had shed nearly a quarter of its membership due to technological advances. Toward the end of the ITU, the mailers outnumbered the printers. With the disappearance of linotype machines and the advent of paste makeup and computerized composition methods, the work in the composing rooms dropped. The mail rooms needed people to work on the inserting machines. =Merger= Concerned that the union did not have the economic strength to win good wages and benefits for its members and worried that further membership declines might threaten the viability of the union, the ITU leadership sought a merger with another printing union. The ITU sought to merge with the Newspaper Guild but terminated negotiations in 1981 after nearly four years of talks. The ITU discussed merging with the Graphic Communications International Union, but the talks did not proceed very far. Later, the GCIU merged into the IBT. Problems plagued the term of ITU President Joe Bingel (1978‚Äì1983). In a contested special election between Bingel and Robert McMichen, McMichen, the anti-Teamster candidate, won the election. However, the ITU was dying. The ITU executive council subsequently required president Robert McMichen to enter into merger talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. IBT President Jackie Presser spoke of merger with the ITU; at the 1983 San Francisco ITU convention. ITU President Joe Bingle risked his leadership post on the ITU‚ÄìIBT merger and lost. However, the ITU's 74,000 members turned down the merger two-to-one in a vote taken in 1985, fearing that the Teamsters could not be trusted to respect the terms of the merger agreement‚Äîwhich included the hallmark of the ITU: autonomy. The Mailers would later join the Teamsters; the Printers would not. The last ITU convention was held in 1984 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. By 1986, the ITU had only 44,000 active members. On December 31, 1986, the Associated Press printed the following with a dateline of Colorado Springs, Colorado: > The International Typographical Union has ceased to exist, and most of its > staff was laid off at national headquarters here. Most of the 60 workers are > continuing on a temporary basis with the Communication Workers of America, > with which the ITU merged, said ITU spokesman Bill Frazee. The ITU ended > operations on December 31, 1986. On January 1, 1987, the union joined the > CWA as its Printing, Publishing and Media Workers Sector. CWA has its > headquarters in Washington, D.C. and employees working for the sector will > transfer there in two to four months, Frazee said. The International > Typographical Union was the nation's oldest union, charted nationally in > 1852. Its membership peaked in the 1960s at 100,000 printers. But since > computerization of the business, membership has dropped to 40,000 working > printers and 35,000 retirees. Finally, in 1987, the printers of the ITU merged with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). It is now the Printing, Publishing, and Media Workers Sector of the CWA. Daniel F. Wasser is currently president http://www.cwa-ppmws.org/ of the sector. The Mailers were split between the CWA and IBT. In May 1986, many Mailer locals joined \\"The Mailers' Conference of the CWA\\". When the ITU ended, some of the Mailer locals merged into the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). It is now the Newspaper, Magazine and Electronic Media Workers Division. Joe Molinero is the division director. The ITU Fraternal Pension Fund was from 1908‚Äì1966. Elmer Brown created the Negotiated Pension Plan (NPP). Today, the pension for all ITU members before 1986 and CWA members since 1987 is the CWA/ITU Negotiated Pension Plan. This pension plan is located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Teamsters have the IBT Pension for members after 1987. Administration =Original chartered locals= On May 5, 1852: * Indianapolis, #1 * Philadelphia, #2 * Cincinnati, #3 * Albany, #4 * Columbus, #5 * New York, #6 * Pittsburgh, #7 * St. Louis, #8 * Buffalo, #9 * Louisville, #10 * Memphis, #11 * Baltimore, #12 * Boston, #13 * Harrisburg, #14 Chartered later in 1852: * Rochester, #15 * Chicago, #16 * New Orleans, #17 * Detroit, #18 * Elmira, #19 * Nashville, #20 * San Francisco, #21 A group of thirty men met to organize the Columbia Typographical Society in Washington, DC in December 1814. In 1867 they joined the newly-formed National Typographical Union (later, the International Typographical Union) as Columbia Typographical Union No. 101, representing workers at The Washington Post, Times-Herald, and Evening Star. Columbia Typographical Union/CWA No. 101 is now the oldest continuously existing labor union local in the United States.https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LR001577.pdf The Typographical Journal records that in May 1892 there were 300 locals. =Office headquarters= At the Kansas City ITU convention of 1888, Indianapolis was selected as the official headquarters for the International Typographical Union. ITU President Edward T. Plank, declared, \\"In 1888 [...] all official (ITU) business, together with books, accounts and records shall be kept [...] at the City of Indianapolis, County of Marion, State of Indiana.\\" During the 1927 ITU convention, at Indianapolis, ITU President Charles P. Howard showed delegates the Van Camp Mansion at Meridian and Twenty-Eighth Streets, which was to serve as the ITU headquarters. The 1959 ITU convention at Philadelphia passed an action to move the ITU headquarters, after 73 years in Indianapolis, it was decided that the headquarters would be moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. The building began in 1961, the new ITU Headquarters (225 S. Union Blvd.) and ITU Training Center (301 S. Union Blvd.) being located on the grounds of the Union Printers Home (101 S. Union Blvd.). The final move to Colorado Springs of President Elmer Brown and the Executive Council was completed in February 1963. The ITU Training Center, which opened on May 5, 1962, would publish The Typographical Journal, The ITU Bulletin, and The ITU Review. The former two were the oldest trade union organs founded in 1889. =Union Printers Home= In 1889, Colorado Springs, Colorado was chosen as the site of Union Printers Home. George W. Childs, publisher of the Philadelphia Public Ledger and his philanthropist friend Anthony J. Drexel gave a gift of $10,000 in 1886 to start work toward the Home, thus starting a fund which grew. The 1890 ITU convention in Atlanta approved of the Home. On May 12, 1892, the Childs‚ÄìDrexel Home for Union Printers opened on located on the corner of Pikes Peak Ave. and S. Union Blvd. \\"A Home for the Aged and Sanatorium for Tuberculars. Maintained by the International Typographical Union for Its Distressed Members.\\" 19th Century printers suffered from tuberculosis, and the clean air of the Rocky Mountains, Pikes Peak area in Colorado was seen as a location to clean the diseased lungs. The home was open only to members of the ITU; members' wives or widows were not admitted. John D. Vaughn served as first Superintendent of the Home while its first member was W. B. Eckert, a retired member and former officer of the Philadelphia #2 local. The 1899 ITU convention at Detroit approved the name Union Printers Home. The home, a hospital and sanatorium, was staffed by its own doctors, nurses and other medical technicians. The lands of the home grew to to accommodate a dairy, farms, gardens, power plant, and workshops to help make the UPH self-sufficient. In 1944, Dowell Patterson (1899‚Äì1968), superintendent of the home, saw that the most modern of medical equipment was furnished to the UPH. In later years, the tubercular sanitoriums were razed. Today the home serves the people of Colorado Springs and El Paso County as a health care facility with assisted living and nursing care. The main building is a State of Colorado historical site. =Women's International Auxiliary= The Women's International Auxiliary was formed at the 1902 Cincinnati ITU Convention. The WIA slogan was Spend Union Earned Money for Union Label Products and Union Services and its quarterly publication was Label Facts. The WIA contributed to the Union Printers Home Fund with various fund raising events. At each ITU convention the WIA would award prizes for the, Union Label Poster contest. Only printer wives were eligible to be elected to the WIA local and international offices. After 1948, mailers' wives were only eligible to serve the local and international WIA auxiliary as third vice president. The Women's International Auxiliary of the International Typographical Union ceased to exist after 1990, which was after the dissolution of the parent union. =Allied Printing Trades Association= In March 1911, five international unions created the Allied Printing Trades Association: * International Typographical Union * Pressmen * Bookbinders * Photo Engravers * Stereotypers and Electrotypers Unions In 1955, there was a new agreement, and the following unions were included in the association: * United Papermakers and Paperworkers * The Newspaper Guild * The International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers * The Plate Printers * Die Stampers and Engravers The Mailer unions chartered by the ITU were eligible for membership in Allied Printing Trades Councils. The International Mailers Union was refused membership. =Mailers= Nearly 100 Mailer Locals would be chartered under the ITU. To mark the difference between the Printers and Mailers Unions, the ITU used the M before the local number. In New York City, Typographical #6 and Mailers, M-6. The position of the mailers was that of second-class citizens in the ITU, with no voice on the executive council. Mailers Cary Weaver and Munro Roberts felt the needs of mailers fell on deaf printer ears on the ITU executive council. The Mailers Trade District Union (MTDU) was an internal part of the ITU. Lawsuits from 1926‚Äì1944 were fought for mailer rights. The MTDU was eventually abolished by court injunction and referendum vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice- president C. N. Smith (a printer) to represent the MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (1935-1937) but he had no voice or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate mailer union. Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (1938-1944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention paved the way for the demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be president, first and second Vice- President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice- President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (1974-1975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (1976-1986).

He played with two different teams over two seasons and ended his playing career in 1982. Early years Cappuzzello was born in Girard, Ohio and attended Youngstown State University. He completed his studies at Florida State University, where he played baseball. Cappuzzello was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 27th round of the 1972 Major League Baseball Draft. Cappuzzello spent a good number of years in the farm system before he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on March 6, 1978, along with John Valle, in exchange for Reds pitcher Jack Billingham. Just two years later, Cappuzzello was released by the Reds and subsequently picked up by his former team, the Detroit Tigers. After sparkling in Triple-A ball that season, Cappuzzello was called up to the big leagues. Major League debut Cappuzzello made his debut with the Tigers on May 31, 1981 against the Baltimore Orioles. Cappuzzello did not fare well, giving up three earned runs and walking three batters in an inning of work. Nonetheless, Cappuzzello stayed with the team for the remainder of the season, starting in three games and coming in relief during 15 others. He posted a 3.48 earned run average (ERA) and went 1‚Äì1 for the season. Later career Before the start of the 1982 season, Cappuzzello was released by the Tigers and picked up a week later by the Houston Astros. With the Astros, Cappuzzello worked in relief and pitched brilliantly in 19 innings of work, giving up 16 hits, and striking out 13 while posting a 2.79 ERA. This high point, however, turned out to be Cappuzzello's final performance as a major league pitcher. His professional baseball career came to an unexpected end.

The Tornado made its debut on July 4, 1978, during Adventureland's third full season. It was designed by William Cobb, and built by the Frontier Construction Company. Soon after its opening it was considered one of the top ten wooden roller coasters in the world. Even today after more than a quarter-century and the addition of many other rides and three other coasters, this is still Adventureland's signature ride. It has two trains, one red and one blue (as of 2020, there may just one train, the red train). The name Tornado has special significance for the park. Adventureland was to open for its debut season in July 1974. However, a real tornado hit the park before it could open, and caused it to be delayed until August of that year. When the ride debuted in 1978, park advertisements exclaimed \\"Another Tornado has hit Adventureland!\\" Layout left The layout of the Tornado is a unique 90 degree curved out and back that follows the shore of a small lake. After leaving the station, the train coasts down a small incline, around a curve, and heads up the lift hill to the top of the first drop. This drop, which is the largest in the ride, can provide for some air time depending on where riders are seated on the train. The second drop is considerably shorter, but leads into the third drop, which contains a \\"head-chopper\\" moment at the bottom as the track ducks under some support structures for the return track, which is immediately to the rider's left at this point in the ride. After drop three, there is one more small hill, by the Outlaw, and then the train rounds a banked turn and heads back to the station via three additional smaller drops. Previously, during busy periods, two trains could be run at the same time. During two-train operation, the goal (for optimum rider throughput) is to have the second train ready to 'release' when the first train hits the midpoint of the track, which is the banked turn where the first train switches from \\"out\\" to \\"back\\". In case something goes wrong with loading, there is an extended covered area beyond the station with skid-brakes where the first train can stop and wait for the second train, if necessary. If this occurs, the second train will enter the station once the other train has started up the lift hill. However, due to safety restraints added to the ride, two-train operation is no longer possible due to the extra time required to harness the riders. The two trains are swapped mid-season. Accidents On July 22, 2006, a loose board left on or near the track of the Tornado by a maintenance worker was responsible for injuring Mackenzie Jennings, an 11-year-old girl. The board hit the girl in the head and knocked her unconscious. She underwent surgery at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines to remove a blood clot and reduce swelling in her head. State inspectors who later inspected the ride themselves discovered the board had not come from the Tornado itself and allowed the ride to re-open. Two others were also injured in this incident.

Though released by the same publisher at roughly the same time, it is an entirely different game from Batman Forever: The Arcade Game. Gameplay The player plays as either Batman or Robin. There is also a fighting game mode called \\"training mode\\" where the player can play as Batman, Robin, or any of the enemies found throughout the game against either a computer-controlled opponent, against a second player, or cooperatively against two computer opponents. The controls are largely based on move lists and key sequences. Some gadget moves involve moving away from the enemy right before pressing a punch or kick button. The gadget list is selected by the player each level, with three standard gadgets for each character and two gadgets selected from a list. There are also four hidden \\"blueprint\\" gadgets. There are two kinds of co-op modes in Batman Forever. Players chose between Batman or Robin. In one mode, Batman and Robin work together and cannot harm each other, although they share credits. In another mode, however, Batman and Robin can attack each other, but still need to look out for enemies and have separate credit counts. The co-op mode is not included in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. The Super NES and Genesis/Mega Drive versions of the game are very similar. The PC version is the same as the SNES and Genesis versions, though Batman and Robin appear in their movie attire. However, the PC version also has loading delays. The Game Boy and Game Gear versions do away with a majority of the puzzle- solving of the SNES, PC and Genesis versions and opt for a more traditional platform fighting game. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the Game Gear version as having graphics that are virtually identical to those of the Genesis and Super NES version, but overall dismissed the game due to poor controls, explaining that \\"Punching enemies is nothing more than a delayed sequence that continues well after the enemy is dead.\\" They gave it a 1.25 out of 10. GamePro also gave it a negative review. They remarked that the graphics are technically impressive but dull due to their lack of onscreen objects and interesting backgrounds, and concluded that \\"the sluggish gameplay, mediocre graphics, and weak sounds really kick this cart to the bat curb.\\" GamePro panned the Super NES version as the worst of the Super NES Batman games. They dismissed the training mode as lacking the winning elements of a decent fighting game. Commenting on the normal mode, they criticized the frustrating difficulty, particularly the lack of continues and the time limit in the third stage, and stated that the digitized sprites were done well but clash with the \\"washed-out\\" background graphics. A reviewer for Next Generation praised the look of the digitized sprites but gave the game one out of five stars, citing boring gameplay and a poor control configuration. Frank Snyder of Computer Game Review wrote that \\"the actual experience of playing Batman‚Ñ¢ Forever isn't much better than that of watching the movie.\\" References External links * MobyGames (Game Boy/Game Gear version) * MobyGames (PC/SNES/Genesis version) 1995 video games Action video games Arcade and video games based on Batman films Batman (1989 film series) Beat 'em ups Cooperative video games Game Boy games Sega Game Gear games Sega Genesis games Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Superhero video games Video games based on films Video games based on adaptations Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games scored by Tim Follin Video games set in psychiatric hospitals Video games with digitized sprites ","title":"Batman Forever (video game)"},{"id":"4989290","text":"Penrith Rugby Club, known as the Emus, is an Australian rugby union club based in Penrith, a western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales.

In its first issue it was defined as Independent, noble and strong. The newspaper occupied all subjects of interest to society and was open to all thought chains. To the death of its founder, (him being just 45 years old), position was made of newspaper his life. Dolores Alcaraz Caldas assumed the periodical, and counted with the collaboration of journalists like Alcides Maia and Alcides Gonzaga. In 1935, Breno Alcaraz Caldas (1910‚Äì1986), Francisco Ant√¥nio's grandson, assumed control of the paper, and remained for more than half a century in that position. After his presidency, however, the group fell into a crisis. In 1984, after long periods of agony, Correio do Povo stopped its rotary presses due to financial difficulties derived from the great investments made by Correio do Povo in order to complete the creation of a new TV Station, TV Gua√≠ba, in the late 1970s.

Pakistan's foreign minister Shamshad Ahmad had warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use \\"any weapon in its arsenal\\" to defend itself. Persuasion for Effect A doctrine is divided into four different thresholds before the weapons would become operationally activated during a conventional or nuclear war with an aggressor state.The Military Balance 2010, p. 367, International Institute for Strategic Studies (London, 2010). In the event of war, for instance war between India and Pakistan, the Indian Armed Forces' numerical superiority and large stock of conventional weaponry is most likely to overwhelm Pakistan. Therefore, in a deteriorating situation, where an Indian military aggression is more likely to penetrate through Pakistan's defenses (or has already breached the main defense line causing a major setback to overall defense) which cannot be reversed by conventional means, the government would be left with no other option except to use nuclear weapons to stabilize the situation, with a first strike. The rationale behind the doctrine is to prevent India from any military intervention (both conventional and surgical) that would lead to the disintegration of the country, as it did in 1971 (see Indo- Pakistani war of 1971). The South Asian affairs expert, Professor Stephen P. Cohen terms the strategy of Pakistan an \\"option-enhancing policy\\". According to sources, the doctrine entails a stage-by-stage level of advancement in which the nuclear threat is increased at each step to deter India (or any aggressor state) from attacking: #A public or private warning. #A demonstration atomic test of a small atomic device on its own soil. #The use of (a) nuclear weapon(s) on Pakistan's soil against foreign attacking forces. #The use of (a) nuclear weapon(s) against critical but purely military targets on foreign soil, probably in thinly populated areas in the desert or semi- desert, causing the least collateral damage. This is possibly to prevent a retaliation against Pakistani cities. Levels of threshold The doctrine is not part of the Minimum Credible Deterrence principle of Pakistan, however, the doctrine is integrated the nuclear dimension into its defence principle. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the definition of the four potential thresholds has been refined from the first thresholds which were mentioned by officials at the Pakistan nuclear command authority in late 2001. *Spatial threshold - The military penetration of Indian Armed Forces into Pakistan on a large scale may elicit a nuclearized massive retaliation, if and only if the Pakistan Army is unable to stop such intervention. For instance, many analysts, including some Indians, believe that the Indus Valley‚Äî the \\"lifeline\\" of Pakistan‚Äî is one of many other \\"red lines\\" that Indian forces should not cross. The capture of key objectives in this crucial northeast‚Äìsouthwest axis might well provoke nuclear retaliation by Pakistan. * Military threshold - The complete knockout or comprehensive destruction of a large part of the Pakistan Armed Forces, particularly and most importantly the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), could lead to a quick nuclear response if Islamabad believed that it was losing the cohesiveness of its defence and feared imminent defeat. A senior ranking PAF officer maintained that \\"orders given to PAF (and its missile command) are identical to the guidelines given to the NATO commanders during the Cold war crises\\". This criterion is even more important for the Pakistan Armed Forces because of its critical role in maintaining the country's stability. As noted above, an attack on a nuclear installation has also been posited as a threshold. According to the PAF, this threshold would also be breached by the use of chemical or biological weapons against Pakistan, and would provoke a massive retaliation. * Economic threshold - This level implicitly and explicitly refers for the countermeasure operations of the Pakistan Navy. Economic strangulation and economic blockade is also a potential threat to Pakistan, if the Navy is unable to counter it effectively (for example, see operations: Trident and Python in 1971). This primarily refers to a potential Indian Navy blockade of Sindh Province and coastal cities of Balochistan Province, or the stoppage or significant reduction of Pakistan's share of water from the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. It could also refer to the capture of vital arteries such as the Indus. *Political threshold - Finally, Pakistan's geostrategists, game theorists, political strategists and planners suggest that a destabilization of the country by India could also be a nuclear threshold if Islamabad has credible reasons to believe that the integrity of the country were at stake. Stated scenarios are political destabilization or large-scale internal destabilization which the Pakistan Marines (along with the paramilitary command) are unable to stabilize effectively. One example would be encouraging the breakaway of one or more of Pakistan's provinces (as in during the Bangladesh Liberation War). *  See also  * Threat Matrix (database) References Policies of Pakistan Pakistan ","title":"Nuclear doctrine of Pakistan"},{"id":"4989310","text":"Asymmetry of lift describes an aspect of the nature of aerodynamic lift generation along the length of an individual rotor blade of a helicopter. Overhead view of helicopter rotors. The rotor tips travel much faster than the inner sections, so produce more lift. (For the purposes of this article, the demarcated circular regions are irrelevant and should be ignored.) The phenomenon is most easily envisaged when a helicopter is hovering, that is, maintaining a fixed position above a fixed point, and with no wind in the atmosphere. A helicopter rotor blade is an aerofoil, acting like the wing on an aeroplane being driven through the air to create lift. In the case of a fixed-wing aircraft in normal flight, the entire wing travels forward through the air at the same speed. In the case of helicopter rotor blades, the tips of the blade travel very fast through the air while the parts near the rotor hub travel much more slowly. Because lift increases with speed, the outermost sections of the rotor blades generate more lift than those parts closer to the rotor hub. So a rotor blade is said to be an aysmmetric generator of lift, because of the difference in lift generated along its length. Helicopter manufacturers try to reduce this differential effect (that is, aim for more equality of lift along the blade length). This has two main aspects: # tapering a blade toward its tip, which reduces its surface area, in turn reducing its lift; # twisting the blade (commonly called geometric twist) so that the blade root near the hub presents a higher angle-of-attack, thus higher lift. When the helicopter is travelling forwards with respect to the atmosphere, a further phenomenon comes into play, dissymmetry of lift.

The game was developed by ABC in the United States, Channel 4 in the UK, and Channel 7 in Australia. It was written by Jordan Rosenberg and created by the agency Hi-ReS!. The experience played out during Losts second season in the United Kingdom and during the summer break in the United States until the launch of season 3. The Lost Experience, which was announced by the United Kingdom's Channel 4, Australia's Seven Network and the United States' ABC on 24 April 2006 Damon Lindelof has verified the canonical status of The Lost Experience and the information provided therein.Lachonis, Jon. \\"BuddyTV Interviews LOST's Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse - and gets Answers!\\" BuddyTV.com, 7 March 2007 ABC Entertainment's senior vice president of marketing, Mike Benson, described the game as a hybrid between content and marketing. This type of marketing was previously used by ABC for Losts premiere in 2004. ABC created a website for the fictional Oceanic Airlines, the airline of the plane that crashed in the show's pilot episode. Premise The game is divided into five phases. =First Phase= The first began on 2 May 2006 in the United Kingdom, 3 May 2006 in the United States and Australia, with a television commercial that aired during an episode of Lost for the fictional Hanso Foundation, a corporation mentioned on the television show. The advertisement listed a telephone number which brought up fictional voice mail lines for employees at the Hanso Foundation. Some of these messages provided clues to be used in the Hanso Foundation's website. Commercials for the Hanso Foundation in subsequent weeks directed players to other in-game websites, some of which are tied to specific sponsors, as detailed below. Several different websites for fictional organizations or individuals mentioned on the show or in part of the Lost Experience were introduced. The websites, particularly the Hanso Foundation website, contain background information into the mythology of Lost. The character Rachel Blake (Jamie Silberhartz), also known as Persephone, is introduced to guide players through the game. Most clues on the Hanso Foundation website are revealed by clicking on faintly marked anomalies in the web page design or by entering specific codes into webpages. Some require passwords found elsewhere, such as in the voicemail service. The clue revelations are designed as minigames, though with little challenge as they are completely linear. A notable exception are the coded messages on persephone.thehansofoundation.org, involving simple encryption schemes such as ROT13 and base64. Also in May, Hyperion published the novel Bad Twin, a book written by Laurence Shames and credited to fictional author Gary Troup, who was on the plane that crashed on Lost. Bad Twin is a mystery novel that contains references to the show and mentions the Hanso Foundation occasionally. On 9 May, various newspapers ran quarter-page ads from the Hanso Foundation which condemned the novel for giving misinformation about the Hanso Foundation. Of note is the fact that \\"Gary Troup\\" is in fact an anagram of the word \\"purgatory\\" itself, indicating that the book may itself be a red herring as the purgatory theory has been refuted. =Second Phase= On 19 June, Rachel Blake's blog is revealed in the source code of the Hanso foundation site, which comes to play a major part of the second phase of the game. Rogue investigator Blake posts videos of her traveling around the world (mostly Europe) to uncover the secret agenda of the Hanso Foundation. =Third Phase= hansoexposed.com is launched through a stunt at Comic-Con on 22 July 2006, marking the start of the Lost Experience phase three. The website (which was identified earlier as sharing IP address with thehansofoundation.org) features open-registration accounts to a video sequence editor. By entering alphanumeric codes new video segments can be added. New codes are expected to be released regularly ‚Äî entering an invalid code yields a statement that the code in question does not work at this particular time. The final sequence of video segments became known as the Sri Lanka Video. =Fourth and fifth Phases= In late August 2006, Apollo chocolate bars (the Apollo bar is a part of the Lost mythology and has been featured onscreen) began distribution through Forbidden Planet stores in the UK, and visits by an Apollo truck in the US. On 24 August the web site was launched. Site users may upload pictures of themselves and Apollo chocolate bars they have been issued. The uploaded pictures now form the word \\"unite\\". A certain number of Apollo bars are designated \\"golden oracle\\", and contain special codes that can also be submitted to the site. A message from Rachel Blake promises that further instructions will be given \\"once enough of the world is watching\\". Finally, the site reported that D.J. Dan would tell the full truth and finally shut down the whole thing on his radio show on 24 September at 8pm PST. The final video (regarding the current location of Alvar Hanso) became known as the Norway Video. Fans of Lost had been looking over the clues and discussing them on internet forums, and several websites were set up giving detailed information on all parts of the game. Since the focus was on the Web (as opposed to broadcast), the intentionally low-fi nature of some Lost Experience material and its use of consumer-oriented distribution channels such as Blogger, Flickr, and YouTube, made it particularly difficult to separate fan-made material from the official canon. The Hanso Foundation Until 20 June 2006, when the Hanso Foundation website closed, the Lost Experience centered mainly around the Hanso Foundation website, with other tie-in websites being linked from hidden clues in the main site. The Hanso Foundation website included many easter eggs, and revealed mysteries behind the Hanso Foundation, its employees, the Dharma Initiative and the island, without spoiling the plot of Lost. In fact, within the alternate reality of the game itself, \\"Lost\\" is considered to be a fictional TV show based on real events and organizations. Since the site's closing, most new clues were related to Rachel Blake's website.Hanso Exposed Viral marketing sites In addition to the specially created sites mentioned below, numerous videos and other bits of information have been intermixed with sponsors' official web sites. For instance, one Rachel Blake video was buried in a Jeep Compass product presentation page.Jeep Compass Interior click In back, Removable flashlight (in trunk area) then View demo. =Sprite= The Hanso Foundation commercial shown during the Lost episode on 10 May 2006 contained the on-screen text \\"Paid for by Sprite\\" and directed viewers to http://sublymonal.com/. The website itself contained references to Sprite. Other clues in the game prominently contained the word \\"obey\\" (part of Sprite's slogan, \\"obey your thirst\\"). As of 10 May 2006, the clock on the Hanso Foundation's site occasionally changed to display \\"OB:EY\\" for one minute. The changes are marked by an audible blip of static. The minutes of the day at which these changes occurred correspond to the Lost numbers (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42), though not every occurrence of these times results in the link. When the clock does change, it becomes a clickable link to the sublymonal website. Later a Sprite commercial appeared on the air that promoted the sublymonal website, which had changed to a completely Sprite- based subliminal ad site. One commercial showed a person blind folded with a lemon and lime slice, getting small drops of Sprite in his mouth and eye. A second commercial showed the clashing of a green sumo wrestler, and a yellow sumo wrestler into a young gentleman. These commercials both contained hidden passwords that flashed briefly onscreen. The passwords, bentley, scan, listen, tongue, chill, belly, spray, pulse, embedded, and duh could be entered into the text box on the sublymonal website for hidden videos and websites. =Jeep= The Hanso commercial shown during the episode on 17 May 2006 contained a Jeep copyright message and directed players to the website [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904061302/http://www.letyourcompassguideyou.com/ www.letyourcompassguideyou.com. Users had to spin their mouse cursor around a compass and click on \\"108\\". A figure could be seen in the compass, which looked a lot like the woman in the opening graphic on the Hanso website. A box then appeared that asked the user if they were \\"one of the good ones\\". Typing \\"Y\\" took users to a page that looked like a directory listing of the site. Typing \\"N\\" redirected users to the Hanso Foundation site. The question later changed and asked if the users believed it or not. Exploration of this site led players to a Jeep commercial hosted on YouTube, which contained game clues at the end. On 26 May access to the directories of /usr/hmcintyr/ and /usr/pthompso/ was granted, created to appear as personal mail folders for Hugh McIntyre and Peter Thompson. Their email folders contained scans of DaimlerChrysler Jeep fleet contracts for the Hanso Foundation, a link to a Jeep commercial and photos of newspaper ads. Also mail found in the directory includes a binary sequence, which can be converted into the words \\"the mouth piece\\". Likewise, the words \\"the mouth piece\\" are found in the image in the directory. The domain letyourcompassguideyou.com is registered to DaimlerChrysler, and the slogan \\"Let Your Compass Guide You\\" is used on the website for the 2007 Jeep Compass. When moving the cursor to one of the \\"hotspots\\", one of the map compass points showed an odd text code in the same font as the glyphs in part 3 of the Lost experience. As of 2007 though, the code remained invalid. On 20 September the site had been replaced with a picture of a postcard and a message stating that the site had been removed. By clicking the word \\"removed\\" it redirected to a youtube video ending with an url. Additionally, highlighting the area below this will show the numbers \\"13/9/19/19/9/14/7/15/18/7/1/14/19\\", which translate to the words \\"missing organs\\". Upon clicking this, one will be directed to an index of \\"/usr\\", with a security notice. Here, from which it is possible to click on \\"ahanso/\\" to view a statement from Alvar Hanso, in addition to the previous McIntyre and Thompson folders. =Monster.com= During the 24 May episode of Lost, The Hanso Foundation advert was shown again, but with a disclaimer indicating that it was \\"paid for by Monster.com.\\" The advert also mentioned the Hanso Foundation Careers website, a mock job search engine with five jobs listed (as of 25 May 2006). The site contains a link to the Monster.com website. There are several grayed letters in the job descriptions: n, s, l, u, t, m, i, e, m, a, y, a. These letters can be rearranged to form \\"inmate asylum\\", a passphrase used in the game. Lost characters Hurley and Libby were both inmates in an asylum. =Verizon= On 6 June, an advertisement aired during \\"Boston Legal\\" that points viewers to the Retrievers of Truth website. The website features Dr. Vincent \\"Wally\\" Bol√©, a \\"pioneer in the field of canine parapsychology and neuroveterinary medicine\\". Ostensibly a site about the psychic abilities of the yellow labrador retriever, solving a puzzle takes you to a bulletin board populated by fictional Verizon employees (the users all have Verizon-related puns in their names ‚Äî iobiSeeingyou, DSLerator, etc.), discussing the political machinations of the Hanso foundation within Verizon as a company. One of the posts also refers to a Verizon advertisement, in which there are clues for the Hanso foundation site. Typing \\"Steinbeck\\" in the text box you would normally put your email address into unlocks a hidden fictional forum. Gary Troup Gary Troup is the fictitious author of Bad Twin, a tie-in novelization set within the universe of the television series Lost and the related Lost Experience. ABC has also released several videos in a nine part interview of Gary Troup, played by Laird Granger, on a fictional show called \\"Book Talk\\". The videos were released on the Amazon, Borders, and Barnes & Noble web sites on their respective Bad Twin pages. Michael Benson, the senior vice president of marketing at ABC, says that Troup was one of the initial crash victims, played by Frank Torres, of Oceanic Flight 815, being sucked into the plane's turbine in the pilot episode. Gary Troup lived in New York and was in love with Cindy Chandler, a flight attendant on Oceanic Airlines. His name is an anagram of \\"purgatory;\\" however, the show producers have stated on more than one occasion that the survivors are not in purgatory. =Bad Twin= On 18 June 2006, Daily Variety revealed that Bad Twin was ghost authored by novelist Laurence Shames. The novel is the story of a down-and-out private detective, Paul Artisan, who is hired to find Zander Widmore, the degenerate twin of Cliff Widmore, a wealthy and successful heir. As do many such stories, the case leads deeper and deeper into a sinister world of betrayal and confusion, as Artisan follows on Zander's heels all over the world, from Manhattan to Florida to Cuba to Australia. He is aided in his quest by Manny Weisman, Artisan's old college classics professor, with whom Artisan shares a dog named Argos, named after Odysseus's faithful dog. Manny provides historical context to the events in which Artisan finds himself, and often provides philosophical commentary on the actions of the various members of the Widmore family. The 2006 novel Bad Twin, by author Gary Troup Bad Twin exists both as a novel in the real world, and as a metanovel-in-progress within the world of Lost. The apparent manuscript of Bad Twin was discovered by the characters of Lost in Season 2 and is read by Sawyer in the episode \\"Two for the Road\\". While the novel's plot has no direct link to the television show, Bad Twin contains many references to it. In the clues about Dr. Thomas Mittelwerk's authenticity there is a statement about dealing with Gary Troup. On 9 May 2006, the fictitious corporation The Hanso Foundation ran a quarter-page ad in several major newspapers, including The Washington Post (on the 10th), The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Chicago Tribune. The ad repudiates Bad Twin for its \\"attacks\\" and \\"misinformation\\" about the Hanso Foundation. Additionally, the Hanso Foundation website contained a press release that was equally critical of Bad Twin. While the novel Bad Twin never makes explicit reference to the events of the show, there are a number of references in the novel to things mentioned in Lost, such as Widmore Industries, the Hanso Foundation, Mr. Cluck's Chicken Shack, Paik Heavy Industry, Cindy Chandler, and the numbers. =The Valenzetti Equation= As part of his fictional background, Troup is the author of an out-of-print book titled The Valenzetti Equation about an equation derived by an also-fictional mathematician of that name. Amazon's \\"exclusive note\\" on their Bad Twin page mentions that The Valenzetti Equation is Troup's first book. The \\"Lost Experience\\" has revealed that the objective of the DHARMA Initiative is to alter any of the six factors of the Valenzetti Equation, revealed to have a huge impact on the date the human race will destroy itself, whether by global warming, chemical warfare, overpopulation or many other possible means. These factors are each associated with a number in the Valenzetti Equation, which are the numbers frequently mentioned in the show: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42.

In 2007, DNREC completed the first version of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan. This plan was a strategy to conserve all of native wildlife and their habitats. The plan will be incorporated into the duties of the Division of Fish and Wildlife. In 2015, there was an updated version of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan. This edition was a ten-year plan to conserve all fish and wildlife and their habitats. The plan lays out specific species which are in the greatest need of protection, their habitats, possible issues, research areas, and conservation techniques. The plan also focuses on increasing knowledge through education and outreach. These projects would be funded through federal State Wildlife Grants.

Early years James Lockhart was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, the second son of a prominent Jacobite family, the Lockharts of Carnwath. His grandfather, George Lockhart, was the Scottish agent of James Francis Edward Stuart, the 'Old Pretender', and the author of the posthumously published 'Lockhart Papers'. These documents, including letters and George Lockhart's journal, comprise probably the most important primary source of information on the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. Lockhart's elder brother, also named George, was the personal aide-de-camp to Charles Edward Stuart, the 'Young Pretender', during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Upon the defeat of the rebellion at the Battle of Culloden, George Lockhart accompanied Prince Charles into exile in Paris. James Lockhart, his younger brother, was 18 years old at the time. As the son of a known Jacobite family‚Äîand a second son at that‚ÄîJames's prospects in Britain were bleak. He therefore left Scotland, aged 18, to make his way in the world as a soldier of fortune. His first service was as a common soldier in the army of Nadir Shah, the Shah of Persia. How James found his way to Persia is not known for certain. In A Memoir of the 'Forty-Five', (Chevalier de Johnstone, 1958), a Lockhart is mentioned who is probably James (p. 244). The passage is worth quoting in full: > We were scarcely a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain pointed out > to me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me > if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him > that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was > uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a > schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, > Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about > eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest > brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so > many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles. The events described take place in Harwich, as the Chevalier is making his escape from England some months after Culloden. While he does not give the Christian name of this midshipman Lockhart, James was in fact eighteen years old when this was written. What is more, his career at sea would help account for his presence some months later in Persia, since the trip overland from Scotland to Persia was exceedingly arduous in 1746. What immediately followed is not known in detail. Lockhart traveled Europe enlisting in various armies and learning the military arts. Towards the end of the war of the Austrian Succession he enlisted in the Austrian service to fight in the armies of the Empress Maria Theresa. In 1752 he was commissioned a captain of the Grenadier Company of the 33rd Regiment, but it is likely that he served as a common soldier before that. Lockhart fought, often brilliantly, in a series of battles against the Prussians during the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), including the battle of Prague in 1757. At the battle of Kunersdorf (1759) he was instrumental in turning the tide against the Prussians, securing an Austrian victory. He received promotion after the battle from the commanding officer, Field Marshal Freiherr von Laudon. He was again cited for signal bravery at the battle of Landshut (1761). Lockhart rose rapidly through the ranks of the Austrian army, and became a general in the Austrian service. Return to Scotland In 1761 Lockhart resigned his commission and returned to Scotland to deal with problems of succession in the family. His father was ailing, and the Lockhart estates were entailed upon his brother George, still living in exile in Paris. George, however, was attainted with treason for his role in the '45, and the family estates would therefore revert to the Crown upon the death of their father, the elder George Lockhart. Staging the death of the younger George Lockhart in Paris solved the problem. At his \\"funeral\\" a casket full of stones served as his mortal remains. As a result of this successful strategem, the Lockhart estates at Carnwath in Lanark shire thereafter passed to James Lockhart upon the death of his father. Military service and honours The Empress Maria Theresa ennobled James Lockhart in 1782, after a campaign in Lombardy in the service of her grandson, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. As Count Lockhart-Wischeart of the Holy Roman Empire he thereafter became a favourite of Maria Theresa's successor, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, and an important personage at his Court. Joseph II was a godfather to Lockhart's son, Charles Lockhart, who later inherited the title. Count Lockhart was a Knight of the Order of Maria Theresa and a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Emperor Joseph II. He served in the last war the Austrians ever waged against the Turks. In his later years Lockhart served on the staff of the Duke of Lorraine, who was the Imperial Viceroy to the Austrian Netherlands. He may also have served in his own right as the Governor General of one of the provinces of the Austrian Netherlands. (Johnstone, 1878) Aside from documentary evidence of Lockhart's service in the Austrian Netherlands, a pair of silver candlesticks he acquired in Brussels in 1782 or later, and had engraved with his personal crest is extant. . This engraved crest is surmounted by the five pointed coronet appropriate to Lockhart's title. The official portrait of Sir James was taken to Sydney Australia where it has resided with his decedents for over the last 20 years. The Lee Penny Count Lockhart has an interesting connection with Scottish literature and folklore. He owned the 'Lee Penny', a Lockhart family heirloom and the most famous of the Scottish touch pieces. Sir Walter Scott described the Lee Penny in the preface to The Talisman (published 1825), his novel of King Richard the Lion Heart's crusade to the Holy Land. This novel incorporates a fictional magical amulet, or 'Talisman', based upon the history and folklore of the Lee Penny. The Lee Penny is owned by the present heir of the Lockharts, and is currently housed in a gold and enamel snuffbox presented to Count Lockhart by the Empress Maria Theresa.

Before the title of Duke of Amalfi was formally established in 957, various patricians governed the territory. Amalfi established itself as one of the earliest maritime trading powers renowned throughout the Mediterranean, considered for two centuries, the most powerful of the maritime republics. The title of Duke of Amalfi was reestablished as a Spanish ducal title in 1642 by King Philip IV of Spain for Prince Ottavio Piccolomini, a Field Marshal of the Holy Roman Imperial Army. Of noble Tuscan descent, two Popes were scions of the Piccolomini family, and the first duke's younger brother, Dom Ascanio, served as Archbishop of Siena from 1628 until 1671. King Alfonso XIII of Spain revived the dukedom in 1902, and the title is extant.

Nevertheless, Amalfi rebelled twice, once electing the former prince of Salerno, Gisulf, and once electing a Neapolitan of that ducal family. *1088‚Äì1089 Gisulf, also Prince of Salerno (1052‚Äì1078) *1096‚Äì1100 Marinus Sebastus A certain Manso ruled Amalfi‚Äîminting his own currency‚Äîunder the title of vicedux (Vice-duke) sometime between 1077 and 1096, most probably during the reign of Robert's son Roger Borsa. Manso recognised Norman overlordship and was most probably a Norman appointee. =Neapolitan dukes (1388‚Äì1673)= The title of Duke of Amalfi (Duca di Amalfi in Italian) was revived under the Kingdom of Naples in the late 14th century, passing to the Piccolomini family in 1461. *1398‚Äì1405 Venceslao Sanseverino, also Count of Tricario and Chiaromonte, and Duke of Venosa *1405‚Äì1438 Giordano Colonna *1438‚Äì1459 Raimondo II del Balzo Orsini, also Prince of Salerno (died 1459) *1461‚Äì1493 Antonio Todeschini Piccolomini *1493‚Äì1498 Alfonso I Piccolomini, whose wife Giovanna is the title character in The Duchess of Malfi *1499‚Äì1559 Alfonso II Piccolomini *1559‚Äì1575 Cesare I Gonzaga *1584‚Äì1630 Ferrante II Gonzaga *1642‚Äì1656 Ottavio Piccolomini, created by Philip IV *1656‚Äì1673 Enea Silvio Piccolomini =Spanish dukedom (1902‚Äìpresent)= The title was revived as Duque de Amalfi by Alfonso XIII of Spain in 1902. * 1902‚Äì1912 Fulgencio Fuster y Fontes * 1912‚Äì1945 Antonio de Zayas y Beaumont * 1945‚Äì1959 Luis Moreno y Zayas * 1959‚Äì1996 Mar√≠a del Carmen Cotoner y Cotoner * 1996‚Äì2004 √ç√±igo Seoane y Cotoner * 2004‚Äìpresent √ç√±igo Seoane Garc√≠a Succession As with other Spanish noble titles, the dukedom of Amalfi initially descended according to cognatic primogeniture, meaning that females could inherit the title if they had no brothers (or if their brothers had no issue).

The series consisted of two pilot episodes‚Äîa musical version of Aaron and Moses's quest to free the Hebrews and a prehistoric love story between a Homo erectus and an Australopithecus. Origins After seeing their student film, Cannibal! The Musical, Fox executive Brian Graden wanted Matt Stone and Trey Parker to create a show that was Cannibal! on a weekly basis (before that, however, they created a short Christmas Card for Brian called The Spirit of Christmas). Thus, Trey came up with Time Warped-\\"a musical romp through time\\". The show starred many of the actors from Cannibal, such as Dian Bachar, Jason McHugh and Toddy Walters. When the first pilot was completed, Brian thought it would work better as a Fox Kids show. After making a kid-friendly pilot, Fox Kids passed on the show. Opening sequence The opening was different for the two pilots. =Aaron opening= An announcer (Trey Parker) introduces the show's logo as Time Warped ‚Äì In Color. He then introduces Chet Martin, with an image of Chet coming toward the camera in a desert. He follows with an introduction to the Time Warped players.

The players: * Imon Welfare (Ian Hardin) * Juan Schwartz (Trey Parker) * Towdry Teal (Toddy Walters) Also featuring: * Peeny Bunslinger (Jason McHugh) * Ichabod Jones (Matt Stone) The opening concludes with the announcer saying \\"It's a musical romp through time: Time Warped\\" and an image of a cavemen examining Chet Martin and the camera. =Rom and Jul opening sequence= An announcer (Trey Parker) opens the show as Time Warped ‚Äì Your Favorite Show and starts singing a song about how Time Warped is your favorite show. Images of the cast flash past, featuring them in costume and captioned with pseudonyms. The players: * Jeffy (Dian Bachar) * Ian (Ian Hardin) * Toddy (Toddy Walters) * Carlos (Matt Stone) The song ends with the same caveman image from the other opening sequence. Plot =Episode 1: Aaron= Chet Martin introduces the show with the prospect of sibling envy. We then transfer to ancient Egypt, where Aaron is riding a camel in the middle of a desert, where he sings with excitement about being chosen by God to give his message to the pharaoh of Egypt. After his song, Moses, Aaron's brother, runs across the desert to tell him that God spoke to him through a burning bush and told him to speak to the pharaoh and bring Aaron with him. Aaron, feeling that he should have been God's messenger, asks how they can prove to the pharaoh that he spoke to God, which Moses answers with a stick that he throws on the ground that transforms into a snake. Aaron agrees and they set off to stand up to the pharaoh. At the pharaoh's palace, Aaron, the better speaker, triumphantly tells the pharaoh of Moses's encounter with God, excluding the detail about the bush. When the pharaoh asks for proof, Aaron tell Moses to bring out the stick. Moses reveals that he forgot the stick and tries to convince the pharaoh of the Lord's magic through parlor tricks. They are kicked out promptly and find that an angry crowd of slaves have just been sentenced to double the work due to the pharaoh's displeasure with Aaron and Moses. Moses tells Aaron to talk with them. When Aaron tries to talk, he is stoned by the slaves. Moses is again instructed by the Lord to have Aaron tell the pharaoh of the plagues that will descend upon Egypt if the pharaoh doesn't release the slaves. This is spoiled when Moses, after the pharaoh asking the form the Lord takes, tells him that he is a great bush. Aaron and Moses are again thrown out. Aaron then sings a song to the Lord about why he chose an idiot like Moses to be his messenger. As Egypt is run with plague, Moses and Aaron speak to the pharaoh again. The pharaoh's wife pleads with him to listen to them, which works, and the pharaoh tells Moses to tell the Lord he gives up. After Moses and Aaron leave, the plaque stops. As the duo speak to the slaves about their triumph, one slave asks about where they will go now that they are free. Having no idea, Moses leaves to ask God, which leaves Aaron alone to be stoned by the slaves again. Meanwhile, the pharaoh tells his wife that he has changed his mind. Aaron finds Moses roasting a marshmallow on the burning bush. The bush then says to Moses that they have to tell the pharaoh that the first born children will be killed unless the slaves are really freed. After Aaron, with anger and annoyance, tells the pharaoh, he tells Moses that he is sick of the unfair treatment he has had and leaves Moses on his own. When plague once again rages on Egypt, Moses tries to speak to the Pharaoh (with Aaron secretly watching in the shadows), but fails miserably. After the Pharaoh sings a song about how better he thinks he is compared to everyone, Aaron realizes that, no matter how much better someone is at performing a skill, no one is greater than God. Aaron tells off the pharaoh and the pharaoh finally lets the slaves free. The slaves, along with some of the pharaoh's guards, start their journey to salvation. In a closing segment, Aaron reveals to Moses that he was adopted, which Moses thinks is a joke.

He was an amora of the third generation (died in ca 320 CE= 308-309; Sherira Gaon, in Neubauer, \\"M. J. C.\\" i. 30; in 300, according to Abraham ibn Daud, \\"Sefer ha-Kabbalah,\\" in Neubauer, l.c. p. 58 at the age of ninety-twoMoed Kattan 28a), and is mentioned frequently in the Talmud. Biography Rav Chisda descended from a priestly family.Berachot 44a He studied under Rav, who was his principal teacher and after the latter's death he attended the lectures of Rav Huna, a companion of the same age. The pair were called \\"the Hasidim of Babylon\\".Ta'anit 23b Rav Chisda was also among those called Tzadikim, those who could bring down rain by their prayers. At first he was so poor that he abstained from vegetables because they increased his appetiteShabbat 140b and when he walked in thorny places he raised his garments, saying: \\"The breaches in my legs will heal of themselves but the breaches in my garments will not\\".Bava Kamma 91b At the age of sixteen he married the daughter of Hanan bar RabaKiddushin 29b and together they had seven or more sons and two daughters. Later, as a brewer, he became very wealthy.Pesachim 113a; Moed Kattan 28a One of his pupils, Rava, became his son-in-law.Niddah 61b Rav Chisda was a great casuist,Eruvin 67a his acute mind greatly enhanced the fame of Rav Huna's school at Sura, but his very acuteness indirectly caused a rupture between himself and Rav Huna. The separation was brought about by a question from Rav Chisda as to the obligations of a disciple toward a master to whom he is indispensable. Rav Huna saw the point and said, \\"Chisda, I do not need you; it is you that needs me!\\". Forty years passed before they became reconciled.Bava Metzia 33a Rav Chisda nevertheless held Rav Huna in great esteem, and although he had established a school built at his own expense in Mata Mehasya four years before Rav Huna's death,Sherira, l.c. he never published any decision during the Rav Huna's lifetime.Eruvin 62b Rav Huna came to recognize Rav Chisda's merit later and recommended his son Rabbah bar Rav Huna to attend his lectures.Shabbat 82a Rav Chisda also presided over the Academy of Sura for ten years following the death of Rav Yehuda,298-299; Sherira, l.c. or following the death of Rav Huna, according to Abraham ibn Daud.l.c. He always preserved great respect for the memory of Rav, whom he referred to as \\"our great teacher, may God aid him\\".Sukkah 33a, passim Once, holding up the gifts which are given to the Kohen, he declared that he would give them to the man who could cite a previously unknown halakha in the name of Rav.Shabbat 10b After Rav Chisda's death, no one succeeded him as the Rosh Mesivta of Sura and the central Talmudic authority passed to Rabbah in Pumbedita. Teachings Rav Chisda's halakhot are frequent throughout the Babylonian Talmud, some being given on the authority of his pupils. His principal opponent was Rav Sheshet. Besides deducing his halakhot in a casuistic way, Rav Chisda was peculiar in that he derived his halakhot less from the Pentateuch than from other parts of the Bible. Rav Chisda was also an authority in aggadah, and employed special assistants to lecture in that department.Eruvin 21b Many ethical teachings by him have been preservedSee especially Shabbat 140b for students, such as: \\"Forbearance on the part of a father toward his child may be permitted, but not forbearance on the part of a master toward his disciple\\" Kiddushin 32a and \\"He who opposes his master is as though he opposed the Shekinah\\".Sanhedrin 110a It was said that the Angel of Death, not being able to approach Rav Chisda because he never ceased from studying, cleft the trunk of a cedar-tree. Terrified by the noise, Rav Chisda interrupted his studies, whereupon the angel took his soul.Makkot 10a See also *Beer in Israel References It has the following bibliography: *Bacher, Ag. Bab.

The match was played between the St Kilda and Fremantle Football Clubs at Aurora Stadium (then the sponsor name of York Park) in Launceston, Tasmania. When the final siren sounded, Fremantle were leading by one point but the umpires did not hear the siren and play continued for around 10 seconds, during which time St Kilda scored a point to tie the match. Four days later the AFL Commission determined that the match should have been ended when the first siren sounded. As a result of this St Kilda were stripped of the last behind and the two competition points for a draw that they had received. The victory and the full four points for a win were awarded to Fremantle. It was only the second time in VFL/AFL history that the score and result of a game was changed on protest, with the first occurring 106 years previously. Fixture and venue The match was played between St Kilda and Fremantle at Aurora Stadium in Launceston, Tasmania. Both teams went into the match with two wins and two losses and many media commentators had commented on the importance of the match to both teams. The two teams had developed an intense rivalry in recent seasons, with a number of controversial games between the two teams ending in very close margins. The previous match between the clubs, at Subiaco Oval, had been highly controversial with Fremantle coming from behind to win by five points after Justin Longmuir took a mark with seconds left in the match and then kicked a goal after the siren. Numerous contentious free kicks in the match had angered Saints fans and the anger was intensified by the subsequent \\"Whispers in the Sky\\" controversy. The match before that, held at Aurora Stadium, was won by St Kilda by one behind, scored by Aaron Hamill in the final minute following a contentious holding the ball decision.realfooty.theage.com.au Aurora Stadium was not a regular venue for AFL matches; it had been used as an alternative home ground by St Kilda and since 2001, and had previously hosted only 16 regular season AFL matches. The crowd numbered 15,282 (the maximum capacity and record attendance for the venue being around 20,000). Teams =St Kilda Saints= =Fremantle Dockers= Brownlow Medal votes: 3\\\\. Matthew Pavlich 2\\\\. Josh Carr 1\\\\. Brett Voss Match Fremantle were leading by 27 points midway through the third quarter when St Kilda full forward Fraser Gehrig conceded five consecutive free kicks during a scuffle with a number of Fremantle defenders. Three of the free kicks were converted to consecutive 50-metre penalties, with the result that Fremantle fullback Michael Johnson walked the length of the ground to kick a goal that gave Fremantle a 33-point lead. St Kilda coach Grant Thomas responded by benching the angry Gehrig. Shortly afterwards he benched tall forward Nick Riewoldt, replacing the forward line with smaller targets in Stephen Milne and Brett Voss. St Kilda then kicked seven of the next nine goals to move to within one point of the Dockers with less than a minute to play in the final quarter. This momentum shift came at a point where Fremantle were \\"killing the clock\\" and with eight minutes remaining took to chipping the ball around to prevent St Kilda scoring. They were aiming to defend rather than attack, and this let St Kilda back into the match. =Scorecard= =Reports= Four reports were made during the clash all during a spiteful first quarter. Three Saints and one Docker were cited: *Max Hudghton (St Kilda) for spitting at Luke McPharlin (Fremantle) in the first quarter. *Fraser Gehrig (St Kilda) for striking Josh Carr (Fremantle) in the first quarter. *Jeff Farmer (Fremantle) for striking Robert Harvey (St Kilda) in the first quarter. *Lenny Hayes (St Kilda) for attempting to strike Steven Dodd (Fremantle) in the first quarter. =Final-minute controversy= With 37 seconds remaining in the game, St Kilda's Leigh Montagna scored a goal to bring the Saints within one point of Fremantle. Following the centre bounce, St Kilda moved the ball into their forward line, where a pack formed about 45 metres from goal and a ball-up was called by the umpire with eight seconds remaining. Nick Riewoldt (St Kilda) knocked the ball across the field, and another pack formed as the official timekeeper's clock reached 0:00. (The timekeeper's clock is displayed on the television broadcast.) The umpire controlling play, Matthew Nicholls, signalled another ball-up to restart play; he was oblivious to the noise of the siren, which was barely audible over the raucous crowd. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Scott Thornton, appeared to have either heard the siren or reacted to other players hearing the siren. At this point, the Fremantle players began to celebrate what they thought was a one-point victory. Nicholls, however, did not hear the siren and refused to listen to the claims of Fremantle players, particularly Byron Schammer, that the siren had sounded. He also did not confer with the other two umpires as to whether the siren had sounded before restarting play. The Fremantle players, who had converged around the ball-up celebrating and remonstrating with Nicholls, were unprepared when the ball spilled out of the contest and was cleared to St Kilda's Steven Baker. Baker, in the clear, kicked from about 35 metres out to win the game, just before being bumped by a desperate Daniel Gilmore (Fremantle). While this kick was in motion the timekeeper sounded the siren again and, this time, it was heard by one of the other field umpires, Hayden Kennedy. The rules of Australian football allow for kicks for goal to be counted if they are in the air when the umpire hears the siren. Baker's shot for goal missed and scored a behind, worth one point, thus tying the scores at 94 apiece. At this point, confusion reigned. The three field umpires and goal umpire conferred to discuss the result. Unaware that the siren had sounded previously, Nicholls ruled that Baker's shot had been within game time, and also that Gilmore's late bump was illegal. If no score had been registered, this would usually result in a downfield free kick; but, under the circumstances, it meant that Baker was given the option of letting the point that he'd scored stand (ensuring a draw would result) or cancelling the point and having a set shot for goal from the same place. The latter option would be a kick after the siren to win the game. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Des Headland, overheard Nicholls stating that the point would not stand and again began to celebrate in the belief that they had been awarded the match, not realising that Baker had received a free kick. At this time, Fremantle coach Chris Connolly and CEO Cameron Schwab had stormed onto the ground. St Kilda captain Lenny Hayes yelled at Connolly to leave the ground, and former teammate Heath Black, now playing for Fremantle, stepped in to separate the two. Baker elected to take another shot at goal but again kicked a behind. At this point the two goal umpires from either end met at the centre of the ground to compare their score sheets, as is standard practice after the conclusion of AFL matches. After conferring for about a minute, they signalled that the scores on the scoreboard were correct and that the match was a draw. It later emerged that the timekeeper had believed that the first siren had been acknowledged when he saw the Fremantle players celebrating the win and the umpire calling for the ball. He then began to do paperwork, paying no attention to the continuing match, and was not made aware that play was continuing until a spectator got his attention by striking his window with an empty beer can. He then sounded the siren a second time, just after Baker's first kick for goal. Relevant rules The relevant clauses of the official AFL rules are: :\\"10.4.1 The timekeepers shall sound the siren to signal the end of a quarter until a field umpire acknowledges that the siren has been heard and brings play to an end.\\" and :\\"10.4.2 Play in each quarter shall come to an end when any one of the field umpires hears the signal.\\" Most commentators agree that the timekeepers erred with respect to Rule 10.4.1; that is, the siren did not continue to sound until it was formally acknowledged by an umpire. Acknowledgement of the siren requires any one of the three field umpires to raise both arms into the air and blow the whistle. There remains some doubt as to whether any of the three umpires did hear the siren, but in any event, none chose to bring play to an end as required by Rule 10.4.2. This rule is not well known by football fans and clearly states that the umpires are the sole judge of when a quarter ends. However, generally this is in terms of a split second decision as to whether a mark or kick occurred before or after the siren sounded, rather than the 25 seconds difference in this case. Aftermath =Initial result= Immediately after the match, Fremantle lodged an official protest, claiming to have won the game by a point. The AFL agreed to conduct a full investigation and did not rule out overturning the result and awarding the match to Fremantle. However, the AFL still released the official round results that listed the result of the match as a draw. =Betting= As a result of the official results being issued on Sunday afternoon, most betting agencies paid out on a draw. Some smaller agencies also announced (before the AFL awarded the victory to Fremantle) that they would voluntarily pay out for the Fremantle win as a goodwill gesture. The largest sports bookmaker in Australia, TAB Sportsbet, however, did not alter from the original decision, even after the AFL revised the official result, because their conditions of betting clearly state that they pay based on the league's official AFL match results sheet as received by fax shortly after each game.foxsports.news.com.au =Media coverage and analysis= As the goal umpires were signalling that the scores were correct, Nine Network reporter Michael Roberts interviewed Chris Connolly on the ground. Connolly was adamant that the siren had gone and said that the emergency umpire had thought Hayden Kennedy had heard the siren, so the game had finished before the final ball-up. He said \\"The right thing has got to be done... I'm sure the AFL will make the right decision.\\" A few minutes later in the changerooms, Roberts conducted an interview with the St Kilda coach, Grant Thomas, who acknowledged that the Saints had played poorly and were happy to escape with a draw. In his post-match conference, Connolly stubbornly described the match as \\"a great win by the boys\\" and stated that \\"the Fremantle Football Club will leave no stone unturned for our 35,000 supporters to get these four points.\\" Over the next few days the incident received widespread coverage in the Australian sports media, with the Australian Football League website describing the match as \\"one of the most controversial matches of the modern era\\". The West Australian and Nine Network's The Footy Show dubbed the incident Sirengate, the -gate suffix being a reference to the Watergate scandal. Media analysis of the incident hinged on the interpretation of the relevant rules. Rule 10.4.2 implies that the match does not automatically end when the siren sounds, but rather continues until the umpire hears the siren and signals the end of the game. This would lead to the conclusion that the result must stand as a draw. However, Rule 10.4.1 requires the timekeeper to sound the siren continuously until an umpire acknowledges the siren and calls an end to play. This rule was not correctly observed by the timekeeper. This leads to an argument that the match was not brought to an end according to the rules of the game and that the outcome of the game was determined not within the playing arena but rather by external governance matters that are the responsibility of the AFL: the quality of match facilities and the performance of timekeeping duties. This line of argument leads to the view that natural justice required the game to be awarded to Fremantle. =Investigation and ruling= The AFL football operations department commenced an investigation of the conclusion of this match, to be conducted by AFL Investigations Officers Allan Roberts and Bill Kneebone. After interviewing the umpires, timekeepers, AFL match manager and a spectator and reviewing the television replay, they concluded that \\"It would appear that the timekeeper(s) have not complied with (Law 10.4.1 End of Quarter).\\"afl.com.au During a four-hour hearing on Wednesday, 3 May, the AFL Commission heard submissions from representatives of both teams and the AFL investigating officer. The result of the hearing was that Fremantle was awarded victory and four competition points, with the official final score reading St Kilda: 13. 15. 93; Fremantle: 14. 10. 94. On 4 May, St Kilda ruled out a legal challenge to the outcome, ending any further uncertainty. The commission stressed that this decision was in response to a unique set of circumstances external to the game rather than overruling an on-field umpiring decision; hence, no precedent was set for the overturning of results decided by controversial umpiring decisions, errors by goal umpires, etc. The key factor was that the timekeeper had not fulfilled his duties by failing to sound the siren continuously until the umpires acknowledged the end of the game. This prevented the umpires from being able to end the game at the correct time.theage.com.au An upgrade of the York Park siren was implemented by grounds manager, former Western Bulldogs player, Robert Groenewegen, in May 2006, in anticipation of the Round 12 game at the venue. =Chris Connolly on the arena= A secondary point for discussion was Chris Connolly's angry march onto the ground. According to the rules of the game, the coach is not allowed onto the playing arena during the game. Because Connolly had walked onto the ground before the umpires had officially ended the game (after Steven Baker's secondary kick), he had contravened the rule, which would usually result in a fine and a \\"please explain\\" from the AFL, but no other penalty. Commentators had pointed out that a fine was not mandatory but applied to a case on its merits and that, in the prevailing confusion of the game, it would be reasonable for the AFL to waive the fine in favour of a simple \\"please explain\\". Ultimately, because the commission changed the result of the game, it meant that the game was retrospectively declared over when Connolly entered the arena. As such, Connolly was no longer guilty of any infraction and the AFL had no grounds to issue any fine. =End of season= The result proved important when determining the ladder placings at the conclusion of the home- and-away season. Fremantle finished with a record of 15‚Äì7 in third place, and St Kilda finished with a record of 14‚Äì8 in sixth place, with and finishing fourth and fifth with 14-8 records. If the draw had stood and all other results throughout the season were unaffected, Fremantle and St Kilda would have been level on 14-7-1; St Kilda's superior percentage would have seen them finish third, with Fremantle fourth, Sydney fifth and Collingwood sixth. This would have affected all four games in the first week of the finals, notably giving St Kilda a double chance at the expense of Sydney (who would go on to make the Grand Final). ;The actual week one finals fixture * First Qualifying Final: vs Sydney * Second Qualifying Final: vs Fremantle * First Elimination Final: Collingwood vs * Second Elimination Final: St Kilda vs ;The week one finals fixture, had the draw stood * First Qualifying Final: West Coast vs Fremantle * Second Qualifying Final: Adelaide vs St Kilda * First Elimination Final: Sydney vs Western Bulldogs * Second Elimination Final: Collingwood vs Melbourne During the season, there was ongoing speculation that if the talented Fremantle lineup failed to reach the finals, it might cost Fremantle coach Chris Connolly his job at the club, and that the two points potentially lost by the siren mistake could be the difference between making or missing the finals. Ironically, however, it was St Kilda coach Grant Thomas who was dismissed at the end of the season after (though not necessarily because) the club was defeated by Melbourne and eliminated in the first week of the finals, which would certainly not have happened if St Kilda had finished third and claimed a double-chance. Similar incidents There have been several occasions of winning scores being kicked after the final siren or bell had sounded, but failed to be heard ‚Äì with a variety of outcomes to protests. * Round 1 of the 1900 VFL season, 9.14 (68) drew with 10.8 (68). St Kilda successfully protested that Melbourne had scored a behind after the three- quarter time bell, and the score was amended to a St Kilda victory by one point. It is the only precedent of a VFL/AFL match result being overturned on such an appeal; and it was St Kilda's first ever VFL win, after 48 losses in three winless seasons from 1897‚Äì1899.Saints' first win ‚Äì round one 1900 * In the 1950 VFA season, Brunswick defeated Camberwell by five points, after the umpire failed to hear the final bell and the winning goal was kicked by Ivor McIvor after an additional fifteen seconds of play. On protest, the match was declared no result; the match was late in the season and did not affect the final four, so it was not replayed. * In Round 10 of the 1962 VFL season, defeated by one point at the Brunswick Street Oval, after the umpire failed to hear the final siren and the winning behind was rushed by Carlton's Martin Cross from a ball-up. Fitzroy did not protest the result; it did request that the Fitzroy Cricket Club install new sirens the ground to avoid a repeat, but the request was rejected. * The 1980 Night Grand Final between North Melbourne and Collingwood at VFL Park ended in similar circumstances: the siren sounded, but the umpires were unable to hear it. In the ensuing play, North Melbourne's Kerry Good marked and goaled after the siren to win the game for North Melbourne by three points. Collingwood did not appeal, and the result stands as official. * A 1982 VFA match between Frankston and Geelong West ended in similar circumstances. The controlling umpire failed to hear the siren, allowing Geelong West's Simon Taylor to kick the winning goal after time expired, while the non-controlling umpire heard the siren and signalled the end of play; the two umpires conferred and awarded the goal. Frankston appealed the result, but the appeal was rejected. As in the St Kilda vs Fremantle match, the Association found that the timekeeper should have sounded the siren for longer. * In the 2006 NTFL season, only two weeks after Sirengate, a match between Latrobe and Penguin ended in a similar protest. A Penguin player kicking a goal directly on the final siren; after conferring, the umpires decided it was after the siren and rejected the goal, with Latrobe winning by five points. Penguin protested but it was dismissed due to lack of evidence. * The 2007 STJFL (Southern Tasmanian Junior FL) Under 14 Grand Final ended in almost exactly the same way. Sorell was leading Lauderdale by three points when the siren blew, but the umpires failed to hear it and the timekeepers failed to keep the siren going as what happened in Launceston. In the ensuing play, a set shot from Lauderdale fell short and was marked by another Lauderdale player, who kicked a goal. Lauderdale were ruled to have won the game by three points and were presented with the premiership. Sorell lodged a protest, and the STJFL declared the match a draw and awarded the premiership jointly to both teams.

He came to public attention as the director of the test teams responsible for the performing the Pakistan's first atomic tests (see Chagai-I and Chagai-II) at the Ras Koh Hills, located in Balochistan Province, Pakistan. Prior to that, he was the project director of the Pakistani missile research and development program and supervised development of the Shaheen-I ballistic missile, and the Babur cruise missile programs. Mubarakmand was the founding chairman of the National Engineering and Scientific Commission (Nescom) from 2001 until 2007. He was subsequently appointed by the Government of Pakistan to assist the Thar coalfield project. Biography =Early life and education= Samar Mubarakmand was born in Arain family from Rawalpindi, Punjab Province, British Indian Empire, on 17 September 1942. He gained his education in Lahore and matriculated from St. Anthony's High School in 1956. After passing the university entrance exams, he enrolled at Government College University (GCU) where he studied physics under Dr. Tahir Hussain. In 1960, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration in experimental physics and a minor in mathematics. During his college years, Mubarakmand was an avid swimmer and represented GCU at the National Games of Pakistan. He conducted research in experimental physics under Dr. Hussain and built an experimental apparatus for his master's thesis. His thesis contained detailed work on gamma ray spectrometry and performed an experiment that was witnessed by nuclear physicist Denys Wilkinson as part of his master's program. Wilkinson spoke highly of his work and invited Mubarakmand to visit Oxford University in the United Kingdom to resume studies in experimental physics. In 1962, Mubarakmand gained a Master of Science (MSc) in physics after publishing his thesis, \\"Construction of a gamma-ray spectrometer,\\" under Hussain. In 1962, he joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and gained a scholarship to study at Oxford University. Recommended by Wilkinson, he was admitted there and joined the group led by Wilkinson. At Oxford Mubarakmand participated in preparing a 22 million volt particle accelerator and was part of the team that commissioned it. During his time at Oxford, Mubarakmand learned about linear accelerators, and after returning to Pakistan he built one. Apart from studying, Mubarakamand played cricket and fast bowled for the Oxford University Cricket Club. In 1966, Mubarakmand completed his doctoral thesis under Wilkinson and was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) in experimental particle physics. After returning to Pakistan, Mubarakmand rejoined PAEC, and also joined the faculty of GCU as an assistant professor of physics in 1966. From 1974‚Äì77, he taught physics at GCU and during his tenure as professor. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Upon returning to Pakistan, Mubarakmand did fundamental work on neutron spectroscopy but later moved on to the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) to do post-doctoral research and joined the physics department led by Dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan in 1966. In 1967, he joined the 'Nuclear Physics Group' (NPG) formed by Dr. Naeem Ahmad that consisted of Bashiruddin Mahmood and Hafeez Qureshi, a mechanical engineer. At PAEC, Mubarakmand additionally worked towards applications involving chemical engineering where he built his reputation among his senior scientists. The NPG worked towards engineering problems involving reactor physics and methods involving gas centrifuges, but the group did not last long together when Qureshi went to join the Radiation and Isotope Applications Division (RIAD) in 1971. =1971 war and atomic bomb project= In January 1972, Mubarakmand was assigned to the Nuclear Physics Division (NPD), led by Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, where he immersed himself in work on the physics calculations of implosion method nuclear weapons. After India announced the surprise 'Smiling Buddha' nuclear test in 1974, PAEC accelerated the program by establishing the Fast Neutron Physics Group (FNPG) on the advice of Abdus Salam. Munir Ahmad Khan made Mubarakmand its first director due to his expertise in chemical engineering and experimental physics. The FNPG generated work calculating the neutron temperature, neutron initiator, and helping design the neutron reflector. During the same time, he collaborated with Hafeez Qureshi to assist in designing the tamper and further helped conclude the calculation of the neutron energy's distributive ranges and the power produced by the neutrons, after the detonation process. In 1973, Mubarakmand commenced the work on calculations involving the 'relativity of simultaneity'‚Äì a key concept involving investigating detonation of the weapon from several points at the same time. However, the work was passed to the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) as as it involved complex ideas of theoretical physics and Albert Einstein's Special and General relativity. In 1978, Mubarakmand built a linear particle accelerator at PINSTECH to conclude solutions in the neutron generator. He later witnessed the establishment of domestically developed supercomputer facilities at PINSTECH to help conduct the subcritical testing. Due to his foremost experience in experimental physics, Mubarakmand was appointed director of the Diagnostic Group‚Äì a secretive division at PAEC that was charged with conducting experimental tests of atomic weapons and responsible for the countdown of the detonation process. A comprehensive work of civil engineering that took place for potential tests sites was completed in a span of five to six years. A milestone was reached on 11 March 1983 when Mubarakmand led the testing teams to supervise the secretive Kirana-I, their first 'cold' test. Although the countdown and experiment was supervised by Mubarakmand, the blast effect was eventually determined by the Theoretical Physics Group. In 1987, Mubarakmand was posted at the secretive Directorate for Technical Development (DTD)‚Äî a secret directorate that developed the explosive lenses and triggering mechanism for the fission weapon. He collaborated with Hafeez Qureshi and Zaman Sheikh. He once described them: \\"These (Engineering) people at DTD were really smart. They were trained very thoroughly in the development of a weapon's necessary materials at very low cost.\\" After a 3-dimensional geological survey was completed in 1978, Mubarakmand first visited the Chagai Hills in 1981 with Ishfaq Ahmad and other scientists from divisions. In 1998, he was appointed as Member (Technical) at PAEC, and guided the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on experimental physics and test preparations. Mubarakmand assisted the government in evaluating the Pokhran-II tests conducted by India in 1998 and supervised test preparations at the Chagai. At the National Security Council's Cabinet Committee on National Security, Mubarakmand backed Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's strong advocacy for conducting the tests, immediately calling for the decision to test. On 19‚Äì20 May 1998, Mubarakmand led some 140 experimental physicists to oversee the preparations in Chagai, Balochistan, Pakistan where he personally supervised the complete assembly of all five nuclear devices. Mubarakmand walked a total of 5 km back and forth in the hot tunnels checking and re-checking the devices and cables which would be forever buried under the concrete. On 28 May 1998, Mubarakmand led the countdown of the tests, codename Chagai-I. Samar Mubarakmand was called by PM Nawaz to Prime Minister House just after India conducted Pokhran II and PM Nawaz asked him the status of preparedness of Pakistan and (Mubarakmand) assured Prime Minister Nawaz that scientists were ready and Pakistan could go for its first nuclear test. On 30 May 1998, Ishfaq Ahmad cleared with the Prime Minister, and Mubarakmand led the very small team of academic scientists that supervised the country's plutonium fission weapon ‚Äì codename Chagai-II. In 2005, Mubarakmand eulogised his memories in an interview with Hamid Mir's Capital Talk television show and said: Recalling Munir Ahmad Khan and PAEC's role and its relation to the atomic bomb project priority dispute, Mubarakmand later said that: Government work and political advocacy =Space programme= In 1990s, Mubarakmand took special initiatives in the advancement of the space program and led a team of engineers to successfully develop the Shaheen-I missile. He was the founding director of the National Defence Complex (NDC) bureau that initiated the work on the Shaheen-I and gathered support for the program. Necessary funding for the program was secured by the military. Mubarakmand oversaw the development of the solid-fuel rocket booster. Initiated in 1987 by the Pakistan Ministry of Defence in response to India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, Pakistan's spin-off missile program was aggressively pursued by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1993. The Shaheen-I missile was successfully test fired in 1999 by a team of engineers led by Mubarakmand. Key strategic weapon systems, such as the Babur and Ghaznavi missiles, were also built by his team. In 2008, Mubarakmand joined the Planning Commission of Pakistan where he strongly advocated for peaceful usage of their space program. In 2009, he revealed the work on Paksat-1R, the nation's first geostationary satellite that was launched in 2011. The satellite was described as being able to monitor agricultural programs, minerals programs and weather conditions and quoted that there were sufficient funds for the defence, nuclear and space programs. The satellite was launched in 2011 from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. His relations with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan often remained tense over several scientific issues. He sees Dr. Mubarakmand as \\"no authority over materials as he is an expert on electromagnetism.\\" =Thar Coal project= In 2013, Mubarakmand assisted the Provincial Government of Balochistan in mineral extraction. He lobbied heavily for the implementation of the Thar coal project initiated by the Provincial Government of Sindh despite strong public criticism by Abdul Qadeer Khan, which described it as \\"intellectual dishonesty\\". In 2015, a breakthrough in the Thar coal project was reported by the media. State honours Mubarakmand has been conferred with state honors for his services to the country by the Government of Pakistan. He is the recipient of the: Sitara-e-Imtiaz (1993); Hilal-e-Imtiaz (1998); and the Nishan-e-Imtiaz (2003), which is the highest civil honor of Pakistan. In addition, he is a Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences (PAS), inducted by Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad in 2000. *Nishan-e-Imtiaz (2004) *Hilal-e-Imtiaz (1998) *Sitara-e-Imtiaz (1993) *PAS Nazir Ahmad Award (2005) *International Scientist of the Year (2007) *Life Member, Pakistan Nuclear Society *Roll of Honour GCU (1962) *Fellow, Pakistan Mathematical Society (2003) Scientific journals and papers =Conference papers= * \\"A Science Oddyssey: Pakistans Nuclear Emergence\\", Samar Mubarakmand, Khalil Qureshi, Masoor Beg, Masud Ahmad. =Research publications= * Aspects of a-emission from the bombardment of 58Ni with 14.7 MeV neutrons, by Naeem Ahmad Khan, Samar Mubarakmand and Masud Ahmed, journal of Nuclear physics, PINSTECH. *Cross-section measurements with a neutron generator by Samar Mubarakmand, Masud Ahmad, M.

Police later searched his house and found 375 grams of marijuana. On 3 June 2006, Brahim D√©by was given a six-month suspended sentence for drugs and arms possession. He was subsequently sacked as an advisor to his father.

An autopsy indicated that D√©by, who was covered in white powder, died due to asphyxiation, probably from the powder, which was thought to have been sprayed from a fire extinguisher found near his body. D√©by had a wound on his head, but this was thought to be unrelated to his death. According to a lawyer for D√©by's family on July 17, D√©by was attacked ten days after arriving in France from Chad; his father had advised him not to return to France due to his past legal issue there. Shortly prior to the attack, D√©by was said to be very worried and had received a telephone call. He was attacked by four or five men disguised as policemen who waited for him to arrive at the parking garage. The attackers tasered D√©by before killing him by spraying him with the fire extinguisher powder.

In 2015, there were 841 students enrolled in preschool through grade 12. The school has a controversial history as part of the segregation academy movement. As of 2017-18, approximately 21% of students were non-white. History Cowles-Woodruff Mansion. Stratford was founded in 1960 by a group of white parents who wished to avoid the prospect of sending their children to racially integrated public schools. The founders viewed the desegregation of Bibb County public schools as an \\"impending crisis\\". In September 1960, the school opened with 117 students and 17 faculty members in the antebellum Cowles-Woodruff Mansion on Coleman Hill in Macon's historic district. Thirteen students became Stratford's first alumni in 1962, and since that time more than 2,700 have graduated from the school. The graduation march in 1962 was Dixie, not the traditional Pomp and Circumstance. In 1970, the school's enrollment increased by 45 percent after the Supreme Court ordered the immediate desegregation of all public schools. In 1972, Stratford Academy was expelled from Georgia Association of Independent Schools because the school refused to cut ties with segregationists. The school has since regained its affiliation with the association, now known as the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA). A news article published in May 2017 quoted political scientist Thomas Ellington, stating that schools in Macon founded between 1960 and 1972 \\"are remarkably different than both the public and private schools formed at other times, either before or after\\" insofar as \\"those schools are generally 5 percent or fewer African-American, in a community that's roughly 67 percent black, according to the last census\\". In 2002, the school's headmaster, Edward England, announced financial grants to attract minority students. At the time, the student body was 93 percent white. Facilities The current facilities were built in 1974 on more than of wooded land in northwest Bibb County. The school completed its move when the Lower School and Kindergarten came to the campus in 1978. The new buildings represent a contemporary contrast to Overlook Mansion and house the four school divisions: Preschool, Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. The Olson Library was completed in August 2000. The Daws Student Activities Center was dedicated in September, 2017. Athletics The Stratford Academy Eagles athletics teams compete in the Georgia High School Association. Prior to the 2014-15 school year, Stratford was a member of the Georgia Independent School Association.

It serves as a northerly alternate route of NY 31 between the village of Middleport in eastern Niagara County and the nearby village of Medina in Orleans County. NY 31E connects to NY 31 at each end by way of a short overlap with NY 271 in Middleport. Most of NY 31E parallels the Erie Canal, and parts of the route run adjacent to the waterway. Outside of the two villages at each end, NY 31E traverses mostly rural areas of the towns of Royalton and Ridgeway. The origins of the route date back to 1914 when its routing was included as part of a spur route of Route 30, a cross-state, unsigned legislative route. The spur route was eliminated in 1921, and the road went unnumbered until 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY 3\\\\. Most of NY 3 west of Rochester was replaced by NY 31 in the mid-1930s, and NY 31 was realigned onto its present, more southerly alignment between Middleport and Medina in 1949. Its former canalside alignment became NY 31E at this time. Most of NY 31E is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, two sections in Niagara County and Medina are locally maintained. Route description Looking north along Main Street (NY 31E and NY 271) in Middleport. NY 31E leaves NY 271 in the background at State Street. NY 31E begins at an intersection with NY 31 in the village of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, overlapping with NY 271 (which also begins at NY 31) through the mostly residential village. Just south of the Erie Canal, NY 31E and NY 271 enter Middleport's small business district, centered on the junction of Main and State Streets. Here, NY 31E and NY 271 split, with NY 31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton‚ÄìHartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more open area of the town of Royalton. NY 31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on its way into the Orleans County town of Shelby New YorkRidgeway . East of the county line, NY 31E becomes Telegraph Road and continues across increasingly less developed areas of Ridgeway. The Erie Canal is visible from most of this section of NY 31E, and about of the highway runs directly alongside the waterway, which curves several times between Middleport and Medina. The two separate at the small hamlet of Shelby Basin, where the route follows a more southerly alignment into a more populated area. Not far to the east is the village of Medina, where NY 31E changes names to West Center Street. The route heads east across the residential western half of the village, passing Prospect Avenue (former NY 63) on its way into Medina's business district. NY 31E passes the village's post office and enter the Main Street Historic District, where NY 31E terminates at NY 31 and NY 63. NY 31E eastbound in Medina Maintenance along the route varies by location. From the Niagara‚ÄìOrleans county line to the Medina village line, NY 31E is maintained by NYSDOT. All of the route within Niagara County, excluding the state- maintained overlap with NY 271 in Middleport, is county-maintained as the unsigned County Route 143 (CR 143). In Medina, NY 31E is entirely maintained by the village, though between the village line and Prospect Avenue (former NY 63), it was NYSDOT-maintained for to its terminus at NY 31 until 2010. History In 1914, the New York State Legislature added two spur routes to Route 30, an unsigned legislative route extending from Niagara Falls in western Niagara County to Rouses Point in Clinton County via Medina. The first of these began at Route 30 (modern NY 63) and followed what is now NY 31E west to Middleport, from where it continued toward Lockport on current NY 31. On March 1, 1921, most of Route 30's Medina‚ÄìLockport spur route was supplanted by an extended Route 20\\\\. The lone exception was from Medina to Middleport, where Route 20 utilized modern NY 31 instead. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 20 west of Rochester became part of NY 3. reference markers remain posted along the road, as seen here. NY 3 remained on what is now NY 31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY 31E.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering U.S. Route 104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY 31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY 31 was shifted southward onto most of NY 3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY 31 was realigned on January 1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY 31 was redesignated as NY 31E, a northerly alternate route of NY 31. The alignment of NY 31E has not changed since that time; however, ownership of parts of the route has changed hands over the years. Until 1998, NY 31E was state-maintained from its western terminus in Middleport to the Medina village line.

Founded at Dickinson College in 1789, it took the white rose and the Roman goddess Minerva as its primary symbols. The Union Philosophical Society adopted a badge in 1791, designed as a Maltese Cross with a wreath of white roses about the letters 'U.P.S.'. The white rose of this society is responsible for the white color adopted as one of the honorary colors of Dickinson College (the red rose of the Belles Lettres Society is responsible for the red color adopted as the other honorary color of Dickinson College). This was in opposition to Belles Lettres, the sixth oldest collegiate organization in the US, and founded three years before UPS. Throughout the college's history and only discontinued in the mid-20th century, Dickinson students had to join either Belles Lettres or Union Philosophical Society to participate in other extracurricular collegiate activities. Belles Lettres and UPS developed a rivalry that continues to this day. UPS and Belles Lettres not only were among the first literary societies but actively engaged in the collection of literary texts. In 1791, the school's library held only a few thousand books. UPS and Belles Lettres began collecting books in opposition to each other and each organization had its own library located in Old West. Eventually, the two libraries together reached almost 10,000 books, and both libraries were donated to Dickinson College. UPS was disbanded in the mid-1970s due to lack of participation. However, on October 12, 2004, the organization was revived and is active once again on the Dickinson campus. UPS is currently a philosophical debating society, inspired by the debate contests that used to be held yearly between UPS and Belles Lettres.  Denny Hall  The Union Philosophical Society was permitted to meet in Professor of History, Robert Davidson's recitation room in Denny Hall. During the 1904 fire of Denny Hall, many early records of the society were destroyed. In 1791, the Union Philosophical Society began to gather a collection of books. As the collection grew, the Union Philosophical Society, as well as the Belles Lettres Society were granted a small space on the third floor of West College to use as a library. As both societies continued to collect books, the space was soon overcrowded. In 1886, the Bosler Memorial Hall was completed and the collections of both literary societies, along with the collections of the college were kept in the new library, Bosler. These collections were absorbed by the greater Dickinson library, now Waidner-Spahr Library. While the Belles Lettres library room was entirely destroyed in a 1984 renovation of Denny, the UPS library room now stands as Denny 317 (also called the Temple of Minerva). The room is framed with stained glass windows that prominently display the UPS crest as well as commemorate the fire that destroyed Denny Hall.

There is an optical companion which is 36 arcseconds away and has an apparent magnitude of +8.4. The spectrum of this star shows it to be a G-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of G0 V. Thought to be around 4 billion years old, it is similar in size, mass, and composition to the Sun, making this a solar analog. It is radiating energy into space at an effective temperature of 5,989 K, giving it the golden-hued glow of a G-type star. Observation in the infrared shows an excess emission that suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk of dust, known as a debris disk. This material has a mean temperature of 60 K, indicating that it is orbiting at a distance of about 29 astronomical units from the host star. The dust has about half the mass of the Moon and is around 600 million years old. The star is being examined for evidence of extrasolar planets, but none have been found so far.

Tempering puts the outer surfaces into compression and the interior into tension. Such stresses cause the glass, when broken, to crumble into small granular chunks instead of splintering into jagged shards as plate glass (a.k.a. annealed glass) does. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury. As a result of its safety and strength, tempered glass is used in a variety of demanding applications, including passenger vehicle windows, shower doors, architectural glass doors and tables, refrigerator trays, mobile phone screen protectors, bulletproof glass components, diving masks, and various types of plates and cookware.  Properties  stress are clearly seen when the glass is photographed through a polarizing filter (bottom picture). Tempered glass is about four times stronger than annealed (\\"regular\\") glass. The greater contraction of the inner layer during manufacturing induces compressive stresses in the surface of the glass balanced by tensile stresses in the body of the glass. Fully tempered 6-mm thick glass must have either a minimum surface compression of 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or an edge compression of not less than 67 MPa (9 700 psi). For it to be considered safety glass, the surface compressive stress should exceed . As a result of the increased surface stress, if the glass is ever broken it only breaks into small circular pieces as opposed to sharp jagged shards. This characteristic makes tempered glass safe for high-pressure and explosion proof applications. It is this compressive surface stress that gives the tempered glass increased strength. This is because annealed glass, which has almost no internal stress, usually forms microscopic surface cracks, and in the absence of surface compression, any applied tension to the glass causes tension at the surface, which can drive crack propagation. Once a crack starts propagating, tension is further concentrated at the tip of the crack, causing it to propagate at the speed of sound in the material. Consequently, annealed glass is fragile and breaks into irregular and sharp pieces. On the other hand, the compressive stresses on a tempered glass contain the flaw and prevent its propagation or expansion. Any cutting or grinding must be done prior to tempering. Cutting, grinding, and sharp impacts after tempering will cause the glass to fracture. The strain pattern resulting from tempering can be observed by viewing through an optical polarizer, such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses.  Uses  Safety approval markings on an automobile vent window made for a Chrysler car by PPG. Police van with screen protector Tempered glass is used when strength, thermal resistance, and safety are important considerations. Passenger vehicles, for example, have all three requirements. Since they are stored outdoors, they are subject to constant heating and cooling as well as dramatic temperature changes throughout the year. Moreover, they must withstand small impacts from road debris such as stones as well as road accidents. Because large, sharp glass shards would present additional and unacceptable danger to passengers, tempered glass is used so that if broken, the pieces are blunt and mostly harmless. The windscreen or windshield is instead made of laminated glass, which will not shatter into pieces when broken while side windows and the rear windshield are typically tempered glass. Other typical applications of tempered glass include: * Balcony doors * Athletic facilities * Swimming pools * Facades * Shower doors and bathroom areas * Exhibition areas and displays * Computer towers or cases = Buildings and structures = Tempered glass is also used in buildings for unframed assemblies (such as frameless glass doors), structurally loaded applications, and any other application that would become dangerous in the event of human impact. Building codes in the United States require tempered or laminated glass in several situations including some skylights, glass installed near doorways and stairways, large windows, windows which extend close to floor level, sliding doors, elevators, fire department access panels, and glass installed near swimming pools. =Household uses= Tempered glass is also used in the home. Some common household furniture and appliances that use tempered glass are frameless shower doors, glass table tops, glass shelves, cabinet glass and glass for fireplaces. = Food service = \\"Rim-tempered\\" indicates that a limited area, such as the rim of the glass or plate, is tempered and is popular in food service. However, there are also specialist manufacturers that offer a fully tempered/toughened drinkware solution that can bring increased benefits in the form of strength and thermal shock resistance. In some countries these products are specified in venues that require increased performance levels or have a requirement for a safer glass due to intense usage. Tempered glass has also seen increased usage in bars and pubs, particularly in the United Kingdom and Australia, to prevent broken glass being used as a weapon. Tempered glass products can be found in hotels, bars, and restaurants to reduce breakages and increase safety standards. = Cooking and baking = Some forms of tempered glass are used for cooking and baking. Manufacturers and brands include Glasslock, Pyrex, Corelle, and Arc International. This is also the type of glass used for oven doors. = Mobile devices = Most touchscreen mobile devices use some form of toughened glass (such as Corning's Gorilla Glass), as do some aftermarket screen protectors for these devices.  Manufacturing  Tempered safety glass which has been laminated often does not fall out of its frame when it breaks ‚Äì usually because an anti-splinter film has been applied on the glass, as seen in this grocery store meat case. Tempered glass can be made from annealed glass via a thermal tempering process. The glass is placed onto a roller table, taking it through a furnace that heats it well above its transition temperature of to around . The glass is then rapidly cooled with forced air drafts while the inner portion remains free to flow for a short time. An alternative chemical toughening process involves forcing a surface layer of glass at least 0.1 mm thick into compression by ion exchange of the sodium ions in the glass surface with potassium ions (which are 30% larger), by immersion of the glass into a bath of molten potassium nitrate. Chemical toughening results in increased toughness compared with thermal tempering and can be applied to glass objects of complex shapes.  Disadvantages  Tempered glass must be cut to size or pressed to shape before tempering, and cannot be re-worked once tempered. Polishing the edges or drilling holes in the glass is carried out before the tempering process starts. Because of the balanced stresses in the glass, damage to any portion will eventually result in the glass shattering into thumbnail-sized pieces. The glass is most susceptible to breakage due to damage at its edge, where the tensile stress is the greatest, but can also shatter in the event of a hard impact in the middle of the glass pane or if the impact is concentrated (for example, the glass is struck with a hardened point). Using tempered glass can pose a security risk in some situations because of the tendency of the glass to shatter completely upon hard impact rather than leaving shards in the window frame. The surface of tempered glass does exhibit surface waves caused by contact with flattening rollers, if it has been formed using this process. This waviness is a significant problem in manufacturing of thin film solar cells. The float glass process can be used to provide low-distortion sheets with very flat and parallel surfaces as an alternative for different glazing applications. Nickel sulfide defects can cause spontaneous breakage of tempered glass years after its manufacturing.  History  Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie (1830‚Äì1901) of Paris, France is credited with first developing a method of tempering glass\\"Glass.\\" The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica : A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and General Literature. 9th ed. (American reprint). Vol. 10. Philadelphia: Sherman & co., 1894. 595. Print. by quenching almost molten glass in a heated bath of oil or grease in 1874, the method patented in England on August 12, 1874, patent number 2783. Tempered glass is sometimes known as Bastie glass after de la Bastie. In 1877 the German Friedrich Siemens developed a different process, sometimes called compressed glass or Siemens glass, producing a tempered glass stronger than the Bastie process by pressing the glass in cool molds.Uhlmann, D.R. and Kreidl, N. J. eds.. Glass. Science and Technology: Elasticity and Strength in Glasses. Vol. 5. New York, N.Y.: Academic, 1980. 197. Print. The first patent on a whole process to make tempered glass was held by chemist Rudolph A. Seiden who was born in 1900 in Austria and emigrated to the United States in 1935.Barr, Johathan. \\"The Glass Tempering Handbook: Understanding the Glass Tempering Process\\". Self published. accessed February 28, 2015 Though the underlying mechanism was not known at the time, the effects of \\"tempering\\" glass have been known for centuries. In about 1660, Prince Rupert of the Rhine brought the discovery of what are now known as \\"Prince Rupert's Drops\\" to the attention of King Charles II. These are teardrop-shaped bits of glass which are produced by allowing a molten drop of glass to fall into a bucket of water, thereby rapidly cooling it. They can withstand a blow from a hammer on the bulbous end without breaking, but the drops will disintegrate explosively into powder if the tail end is even slightly damaged.

Shortly after closure, PDCS was converted into an elementary school called Lakewood Public SchoolCelebrating a new adventure at Lakewood Elementary at Grand Erie District School Board in an attempt to attract the children of New Canadians to the area. Students here typically lived south of Simcoe, northeast of Turkey Point and southwest of Jarvis. PDCS had a well established theatre arts program which allowed students to take drama in Grades 9 and 10, and then go on to the unique Theatre Co-op Program. This program ran at the community's Lighthouse Festival Theatre and each year culminated in a class-directed and produced production. In 2011, the class performed the play Sticks and Stones. In addition to its drama classes, the school has a long tradition of excellence at the prestigious Sears Drama Festival. In 2010, the school's production of The Insanity of Mary Girard was one of three plays from the district festival at the Lighthouse Theatre to go on to the regional festival in Hamilton. In 2011 the school's play The Chronicles of Jane, Book Seven was also selected to represent the district at the regional festival, again held in Hamilton. School closure Port Dover Composite School was originally given the option of remaining open until September 2013; although it has been officially declared that this school will be closed by January 31, 2013. Students who have not already transferred to Simcoe Composite School had to become permanent students there for the duration of their high school \\"career.\\" Several small groups of Port Dover Composite School students had taken small tours around the Simcoe Composite School campus on November 29, 2012 in order to start the transition from into a high school outside their own community. Had the traditional Norfolk County high school boundaries been strictly enforced as it been in the past, the students would have filled 78% of the school's total capacity. The worst possible outcome for PDCS coming into the 2012-13 school year was to have classes until the end of January 2013 with each class having less than six students attending, before closing the high school permanently. This has already been achieved despite adding wi-fi Internet access and Smart Boards in an attempt to lure more teenagers into attending PDCS. Most of the students who have attended Port Dover Composite School in the previous (2011‚Äì12) school year have left in a sudden \\"exodus\\" to attend Simcoe Composite School in the search of better school programs. Only 14 teachers have remained at the high school as of the beginning of the 2012-13 school year. In additional, almost all athletic teams have been eliminated in favor of a strict academic approach to schooling. Traditional favorites like high school football and basketball have been scrapped; with a bye given to opponents who were supposed to play against PDCS this year due to a lack of manpower needed to operate a football or girls' basketball team. Some of the less demanding sports like volleyball (for grades 11 and 12) had been given authorization to compete by the school's athletics department; with 25% of the students on the team. Absenteeism was virtually non-existent in the final year of school operations. Due to a declining youth population in the Port Dover area, the school was officially closed on January 31, 2013. Compared to 2001, there are 1800 fewer children and young people living in the vicinity of Port Dover Public School. Academic programs in Valley Heights Secondary School and Delhi District Secondary School have been beefed up; hoping to attract former PDCS students to those schools. Future of Norfolk County schools While most schools under the governmental school system (Grand Erie District School Board) will remain open in the foreseeable future, they will see more than 1000 empty seats in their classes by 2017. Everything from homeschooling to the rapidly aging local population to the increasing popularity of virtual high schools on the Internet has stunted the ability of the government-funded secular high schools to maintain full classrooms in recent years. Waterford District High School may once again face serious threats of closure by 2017 due to government cutbacks and declining enrolment. If attendance continues to decline due to aging and the abandonment of traditional school settings for \\"safe\\" online learning environments, another solution would be to close down Simcoe Composite School and Waterford District High School in favor of a new secular high school spanning somewhere in Norfolk County. Both Valley Heights Secondary School and Delhi District High School have the government funding and student enrolment numbers needed to remain open as separate institutions for an indefinite period of time. The gradual aging of the local population will eventually eradicate the young people from the communities of Norfolk County. Port Dover will have lost 3,600 children and young people between the years 2001 and 2023 due to the diminishing youth demographics of Norfolk County. All public secondary schools that currently serve Norfolk County students will eventually have to be converted into \\"Internet-only\\" establishments. These establishments would allow anyone between the ages of 14 and 21 with a broadband Internet connection and fluency in the English language to \\"attend\\" a high school in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada. The core curriculum would be taught for students in grade 9 through grade 12 in addition to Canadian culture, laws, geography, and history; helping people acquire a Canadian-style secondary school education and facilitating their way to acquiring Canadian citizenship.

Warringah Rugby has one of the largest numbers of registered junior players in Australia. Club history The club was formed in 1963 due to a high demand of junior rugby players searching for clubs on the northern peninsula. Being one of the most rapidly developing areas in Sydney at the time this subsequently led to the establishment in the 1962/1963 season of the Warringah Junior Rugby Union. The Senior Club was formed to supplement the already established Warringah Junior Rugby Union and commenced playing in the Sydney second division in 1964. Its aims were to provide rugby for juniors, colts and grade players and to eventually join the 1st Division Championship competition. In 1970 the Club won the 2nd Division 1st grade Premiership and was promoted to the 1st Division for the 1971 season. More affectionately known as the Rats or Ratties, the club took on this tag after experiencing many difficult years with many humiliating defeats. The players were reminded by Doug Leslie Snr (Rats of Tobruk), that to give up in the face of adversity is never an option. The tradition of the Rats of Tobruk, of bonding together and making commitments in the true spirit of mateship should always be remembered and will prevail just in the same way as the Desert Rats of Tobruk prevailed.

The Multan facility, like some but not all other nuclear facilities in Pakistan, is not subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection. Security of the site and its inventory is professed by the Pakistani government. Historical background In 1960, then Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) chairman Dr. Nazir Ahmed made a proposal to the chairman of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) for the construction of a heavy water plant with production capacity of 50 kg of heavy water per day at Multan, in conjunction with a planned fertilizer factory. However, the PIDC did not immediately act on the PAEC's proposal. Dr. Ishrat Hussain Usmani was head of the PAEC when construction of the plant began. The plant was constructed indigenously by PAEC and financed by Pak Arab Fertilizer (PAF). Construction of the plant began in 1962. Investment finance was provided by PAF during the 1960s. The plant was expanded in 1978. Project management was headed by PAEC chairman Munir Ahmad Khan. Two further plants were designed and constructed under the guidance of Munir Ahmad Khan.

The market is actually held on the Thursday through Sunday preceding the first Monday of each month. It purports to be the largest and oldest continually operated flea market in the United States, and is a highly popular event in the area. Depending on the time of year, up to 100,000 shoppers frequent the fair in a weekend.Canton Texas Monthly History First Monday Trade Days began sometime in the 1850s. As was common in those days, the circuit judge would stop in certain areas on specific days to hold court sessions. People came to town on those days to see the court proceedings and to conduct business. Canton's designated day was the first Monday of each month, hence the origin of the name. Since most of Van Zandt County was open range at that time, a state law required that all stray horses be brought into Canton and auctioned to the highest bidder. These horses had been picked up on the range and boarded by the farmers until the day of the auction. People came from all around to participate, and this became known as \\"First Monday Trades Day\\", sometimes called \\"Horse Monday\\". Soon the people were bringing their own horses to sell or trade, and as the years passed, they began to bring their excess crops, such as fresh produce, grain, and sugar cane syrup. Some dispute those claims and rely on the legend claiming that during middle nineteenth century, this trades day became an important custom to the rural people. With poor means of communication, people would wait until \\"First Monday\\" to come to Canton to see their relatives and friends, to make business arrangements, and to get the local news. During the election years, the politicians would center their campaigns around \\"First Monday\\". This event would accumulate more people of the county together at one time than any other function of its time. As the years passed and the population of Canton increased, the crowds at \\"First Monday\\" increased too‚Äîall without any planning or organization‚Äîjust naturally. The trading area was on the streets. People would stroll up and down, trading, visiting and transacting their business. The townspeople began to look on the event with disdain, dreading the filth and confusion that cluttered their city. They finally passed a city ordinance prohibiting trade in the streets, but to no avail; the law could not be enforced. The crowds were too large for the small city to disperse. The only hope the city had was hopefully the custom would finally \\"play out\\" as had most of the other trades days in Texas. This did not come about. In the 1930s when the importance of the horse began to decline, it was thought that \\"First Monday\\" would vanish. There appeared about a ten-year void in Texas between the horse-raising era and the tractor era, and out of state horse traders began to bring in horses to supply this void. Horse buyers from all over the state began to attend \\"First Monday\\" and the crowds got larger and larger. It became known statewide as the place to buy a good \\"bronc\\". Then, in the 1940s, as the tractor came in and horses declined, hog trading took its place. Feeder pigs were raised locally, and soon they gained the reputation of being the cleanest and finest pigs sold anywhere --- cholera free. Buyers came in from all over Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to buy these fine pigs. Dogs were also a commodity. At first, farmers would bring in strays and unwanted offspring; then the hunters started bringing their hound dogs. Soon the whole town was saturated with hound dogs, some selling for as much as $500. \\"First Monday\\" now became known all over the Southwest to dog fanciers as \\"Dog Monday\\". One could see anything from a Russian Setter to two types of specialized squirrel dogs (one to hunt gray squirrels and one to hunt fox squirrels). After the event, many of the worthless dogs were released, and Canton found itself flooded with stray dogs; it was soon necessary to hire a dog catcher. By 1950 the crowds were approaching the 5,000 mark, and space became a problem. One homeowner, a woman who owned a double lot, began patrolling her property with a broom to keep the people off. Finally, one trader offered to rent space from her. Then she started renting her entire area. Soon she was making $75 to $100 every \\"First Monday\\". Eventually other homeowners did the same. One widow was offered twenty-five cents for the use of her bathroom, and soon this was a big business too. As space became a premium, the traders began to arrive on Sunday in order to get the best space first. This created more serious problems. The churches began to complain about the congestion and activity on the Lord's Day. Sanitation became a big factor. These people had to stay over night in their cars and trucks because there were not adequate facilities in the small town. It was soon apparent that a city police force was needed to control and maintain order among these visitors. In the early 1960s, a man was bitten by a dog and died of rabies. A city ordinance was passed prohibiting dogs. The townspeople thought this might stop the trades day. It didn't. An individual bought of land and began to have the dog trade there on his property. The city did require that they all be vaccinated and kept leashed or penned. The dog trade flourished, and so did the rest of trades day. With the crowds growing larger and people coming in on Sunday, the Mayor and the City Council decided something had to be done. Rules and regulations had to be enacted, a place found, and some kind of order established. Canton had not encouraged \\"First Monday\\" --- actually it had discouraged it --- but the custom had become entrenched into the culture of the people for over 100 years, and it looked as though it was there to stay. It had gained national recognition by this time. Feature stories had appeared in Life, Look, and The Saturday Evening Post. Texas newspapers periodically acclaimed its appeal and uniqueness. In 1965, the City of Canton began a plan of action. The City did not have the funds to move the trading area so Angus Travis, and Joe Hackney partnered and purchased six and a half acres of land north of the square and designated it as a trading area. The City leased the land from H & T Parking and the area was divided into spaces, and each space was rented for a nominal fee, depending upon the type of merchandise offered for sale or trade. This was a new beginning for an old tradition, with a plan for the future. In a short time, this area became filled to overflowing. As more land could be secured by the City, adjoining the original site, it was bought and developed for use. Today, the City of Canton has over , which can accommodate over 3,000 dealers. Despite numerous and repeated attempts by early city officials to discourage traders from doing business on the streets of the city, First Monday Trade Days continued and flourished. Eventually Canton realized that it could benefit from the popularity of the market, and purchased a site dedicated to it. Trade days today First Monday Trade Days currently operates over and provides places for 6,000 vendors. There are various buildings and areas, each designated by name, among them the Original Pavilions, Canton Marketplace, Old Mill Marketplace, The Village, The Mountain, The Arbors and The Dog Alley. There is also an area adjacent to the First Monday Trade Days facility (the one operated by the city) known as 'the Lewis side'. In 2009 Henry Lewis, owner of 'the Lewis side' purchased the Arbors. The buildings, known as pavilions, house the more established and regular vendors. They are full of the \\"regulars\\" who have reserved these spaces for the entire year. Most feature new crafts or products with a decidedly country or western feel. They are popular with shoppers looking for dependability and the modestly higher prices that go along with it. Most vendors in these areas are unwilling to come down much on their prices, but bartering is always welcome. The Canton Marketplace is the first building which begins the Trade Days market area on Highway 19. It is a climate controlled indoor pavilion with over 300 vendors who are mostly year round regulars. This pavilion has slightly more upscale items than the rest of the grounds and a food court. Despite the upscale feel, you can still find excellent bargains on unique items. Sometimes you can catch concerts or other free venues during trade days weekend here. Their restrooms are the best found anywhere on the grounds and there is a winery which offers taste testing. They have convenient onsite parking, an RV Park, and offer a free trolley transportation to the other First Monday areas. As of Spring 2014, a 10' x 20' or 14' x 14' booth inside one of the main (buildings 2, 3 and 4) costs approx $200 per weekend (Wednesday afternoon/Thursday morning setup to end-of-show Sunday). The \\"unreserved\\" areas of the market are by far the most interesting and most likely to produce an unexpected treasure. It is \\"first-come-first-served\\" in these areas and the vendors who arrive early get the choice shady spots. Anything and everything can be found and there is a definite garage sale feel but with a general nod toward collectibles. The majority of items are old but bargains can be found in current categories such as computer and office supplies, tools, yard art and furniture, and even toys. You never know what you'll find in these sections and valuable items can still be found. This is becoming a bit harder than it used to be because of the advent of eBay and the general increase in knowledge of collectors and sellers. Just like the material items for sale, food is also abundant and varied. Quality is generally very good but most is on the unhealthy junk food side of the menu. This doesn't mean that one can't eat healthy. There are options available but everyone tends to go with the \\"I only come once a year\\" mentality. Canton favorites include cheesecake sundae in a cup, fresh-squeezed lemonade, smoked turkey legs, funnel cakes (pancakey batter drizzled into hot oil through a funnel and covered in powdered sugar), sausage on a stick, corny dogs, kettle corn (mildly sweet popcorn), and wonderful homemade breakfasts. You can snack your way through or sit down to a complete meal. Prices are higher than typical fast food but not unreasonably so. Despite the large size of the facility, people with disabilities will find easy access, and can even rent a scooter to get around the market area with ease. Be aware however that extremely hot weather can make a big difference in ability to get around. Because of the income the city receives from operating the facility, until 2006 a city property tax was not required from Canton's residents. Many residents have also turned struggling farms into support businesses. One such farm located across the main highway turned its land into parking spaces. They now make more from charging drivers to park on their lot for the 4 days of the event than they ever did from farming the same land. By the way, parking as of early 2007 is $4/car almost everywhere. No free parking on city streets is available. Some advice for new visitors: * Try to visit on a Thursday or Friday since crowds are slightly lower and selection is best. * Spring and fall are the most pleasant seasons to visit. * If you see it and love it, buy it. Don't take the chance on it being there when you return. Being new, you may not find the same booth again. It is easy to get turned around. * Plan at least 5 hours to make even a cursory \\"run-through\\" of the area. Serious shoppers will need 8 hours to 3 days to cover the entire grounds. * Bargain with the vendors. Even in the more established sections you can never tell who will say yes. * Take a magnifier and small magnet. They'll come in handy for examining condition and identifying \\"brass\\" or \\"bronze\\" that is really steel. * Wear comfortable shoes all the time and clothing appropriate for the season. Almost year 'round‚Äîwear sunscreen. * If you don't know about an expensive collectible, be wary. Fakes and overpricing exist but knowing something about the item can prevent a bad purchase. * Remember where you park. Even small purchases get heavy when carried over time and distance. You'll want to drop items off in the trunk. On Friday, May 2, 2008, Canton and First Monday Trade Days were hit by a tornado, that damaged signs, chimneys, vendor's goods, and uprooted several large trees. In March 2020, for the first time in Trade Days history the Trade Days were canceled for the upcoming April Trade Days, due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.

The route is two lanes wide for its entire length and passes through mostly rural areas, save for the hamlet of Morton at a junction with Kenmore and Morton Roads (the latter being former NY 360). NY 272 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been altered since. Route description NY 272 begins at an intersection with NY 104 (Ridge Road) on the Orleans‚ÄìMonroe county line, which also separates the towns of Clarkson and Murray. The two-lane route heads north, passing through open fields and over Sandy Creek to intersect NY 18 at Kendall Mills, a hamlet in the town of Hamlin. NY 18 briefly overlaps NY 272 northward but veers west off the county line and into Kendall south of the dual-town hamlet of Morton. The number of homes and businesses along NY 272 begins to rise during the stretch between Kendall Mills and Morton. NY 272 northbound in Morton NY 272 directly serves Morton, a small community situated equally in the town of Kendall and the town of Hamlin. In the center of Morton, NY 272 intersects Morton Road (unsigned County Route 279 and formerly NY 360), which approaches NY 272 from the Monroe County side. North of Morton, the amount of development along the road declines sharply as it heads toward Lake Ontario. NY 272 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at an interchange south of the shoreline near the west end of Hamlin Beach State Park. This is the last signed highway that NY 272 intersects; however, NY 272 officially continues to the lakeside hamlet of Troutburg in the town of Hamlin, where it terminates at a dead end at the southern lakeshore. NY 272 is one of only two state highways in New York that are located wholly along a county boundary. Incidentally, the other one is NY 269 on the other side of Orleans County, which delimits the boundary between Orleans and Niagara Counties. History reference marker is visible to the right The portion of the Orleans‚ÄìMonroe county line road north of Ridge Road was added to the state highway system in stages during the late 1900s and early 1910s. The section north of the Clarkson‚ÄìHamlin town line cost $39,531.05 (equivalent to $ in ) to improve to state highway standards and was accepted into the system on December 1, 1909, as the unsigned State Highway 398 (SH 398). To the south, the piece between Ridge Road and the south end of SH 398 cost $20,199.14 (equivalent to $ in ) to bring up to standards and was included in the system on November 12, 1913, as SH 588. Neither SH 398 nor SH 588 were assigned a posted designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when they were collectively designated as NY 272.

The town is situated on the western side of the southern tip of Eyre Peninsula about 46 km from Port Lincoln. The population swells during holiday seasons to more than 2,000 people due to its proximity to the Coffin Bay National Park. It is a popular location for boating, sailing, swimming, water-skiing, skindiving and wind-surfing, as well as fishing (rock, surf, angling and boat). Oyster farming is conducted in the quiet waters of Coffin Bay. Coffin Bay is in the District Council of Lower Eyre Peninsula local government area, the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.  History  British naval explorer Matthew Flinders named the bay on 16 February 1802 in honour of his friend Sir Isaac Coffin, who was Resident Naval Commissioner at Sheerness, where the Investigator was fitted out. The same year, French explorer Nicolas Baudin provided the alternative French name of Baie Delambre.Property Location Browser V2 Government of South Australia, Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure Retrieved 2014-01-01.

In 1957, the private town of Coffin Bay was laid out by Stanley Germain Morgan on section 132 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Lake Wangary. In 1966, BHP opened the Coffin Bay Tramway between a site south-east of the town and Port Lincoln to convey lime sands. It was closed in 1989, with the track removed in 2001. On 16 October 2003, boundaries were created for the locality includes the full extent of the Coffin Bay Peninsula and land to the east bounded in the north in part by the channel connecting to Kellidie Bay and by the Coffin Bay Road, and in the east by the eastern boundary of the Hundred of Lake Wangary. The locality which was given the \\"long established name\\" includes the private town, the Coffin Bay Shack Site and the Coffin Bay National Park. The Parnkalla people occupied the area prior to European settlement in the 1830s. The historic former Coffin Bay Whaling Site at Point Sir Isaac lies within the locality and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

It was the thirty-third and final motion picture to star Elvis Presley before his death in 1977. Background A follow-up to the 1970 release Elvis: That's the Way it Is, another musical documentary, this film followed Presley as he embarked on a 15-city tour of the United States that featured 19 concerts between April 5th and April 19th, 1972.Adams (2008), The Elvis Encyclopedia, p.134 Elvis on Tour also contains vintage footage of Presley's famous 1956 appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and pre-tour rehearsal footage. It also includes footage of enthusiastic fan reactions scattered throughout the film. Also included are portions of a forty-minute interview that Presley gave about his life and career before filming began. Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, was unhappy with the inclusion of a scene which mocked Presley's acting career by showing screen kisses taken from a number of his previous films. According to the producers, it was a tongue-in-cheek dig at the repetitiveness of these films by changing the background \\"but the plot stays the same\\". Among those working on this film were Martin Scorsese, who supervised montage sequences, and David Draper a former Mr. Universe. The film was directed by Pierre Adidge and Robert Abel. Reception The concert film reached #13 on the Variety National Box Office Survey. In general, documentaries were very rarely box office successes. However, despite costing upwards of $1.6 million to produce, most of which was Presley's $1 million fee, the film recouped its production costs after just three days in theaters. As well as being a financial success, Elvis on Tour proved to also be a critical success by winning the 1972 Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary, making it the only Elvis film to win an award of any kind. The 1997 VHS reissue was negatively criticized because of the lack of the multi-screen images that were present on all previously released VHS copies of the film. Aftermath Although Presley would be offered numerous film roles over the next few years (most notably the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born), he would make no more films in his lifetime. Footage from Elvis on Tour would later be reused in the 1981 Elvis documentary This Is Elvis. Songs featured in the film The working titles of the film were Sold Out and then Standing Room Only, and a soundtrack album was planned with this title, but never released. As the album Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden featured many of the songs set to be in the film and was released prior to the film, Elvis on Tour was the only Presley film not accompanied by some form of official soundtrack release, either in the form of a full album or a single. All of the following songs were performed by Elvis onstage unless otherwise noted: * \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (A rehearsal recording by Elvis played over the opening credits. The DVD/Blu-ray release replaced this with a live recording of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", but the digital copy of the film keeps it in.) * \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\" (Performed by The Joe Guercio Orchestra but was not used in the film due to copyright issues. However, an unknown vamp in a similar arrangement was used in its place.) * \\"See See Rider\\" * \\"Polk Salad Annie\\" * \\"Separate Ways\\" (An unreleased studio take.) * \\"Proud Mary\\" * \\"Never Been to Spain\\" * \\"Burning Love\\" * \\"For The Good Times\\" (Sung informally by Elvis in a car as he was leaving a concert.) * \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" (Performed on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956.) * \\"Ready Teddy\\" (Performed on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956.) * \\"That's All Right\\" (Original Sun recording played over a slideshow of photos from Elvis' early career.) * \\"The Lighthouse\\" (Performed by J.D.

Trained throughout his career by Lee Freedman and ridden in his Group One wins by Bruce Compton (once), Darren (once), Darren Beadman (five times), and Greg Hall (once), Super Impose won the AJC Epsom and Doncaster Handicaps two years in a row, in 1990 and 1991, and won the Cox Plate at his penultimate start as an eight- year-old in 1992.Super Impose's full race record  Breeding  Foaled in New Zealand, Super Impose was a son of the multiple Group One winner Imposing (Todman-Hialeah), out of the unraced mare Pheroz Fancy (Taipan II-Pheroz Jewel). Pheroz Jewel was a stakeswinning mare in New Zealand who defeated Grey Way, while Todman was an Australian racehorse who won the inaugural Golden Slipper in 1957. Super Impose, via Todman and Ritmar (dam of Taipan), had Star Kingdom blood on both sides of his pedigree. The imported Irish stallion was a dominant influence on Australian racing before the preponderance of Northern Dancer-line stallions, such as Danehill, in the 1990s. Taipan, via his sire Bold Ruler, also introduced powerful American-bred descendants of Nearco into the pedigree. Super Impose descended from an old colonial New Zealand family, (C-23), that had not produced many notable winners until the last few decades.Family C-23: Winnie Retrieved on 8 May 2009  The beginnings (1986‚Äì1987)  The chestnut Super Impose was selected by trainer Lee Freedman at the 1986 Trentham yearling sales in New Zealand for a small syndicate who paid $40,000. Interviewed for 'Super Better Best',Crawley, Steve (1993) 'Super Better Best', Raceplay, 87-93 Thislethwaite Street, South Melbourne, Victoria, 3205, VHS cassette/DVD along with Lee Freedman, managing part-owner Chris Biggins explained that Freedman had rung him from New Zealand and said that there were three horses he had liked at the sale. Freedman predicted that the first two would make 'too much money', while the third was a 'beautiful, imposing horse'. The first two were sold to Bart Cummings and became the multiple Group One winners Sky Chase and Beau Zam, while the third became Super Impose. He was unraced as a two-year-old. Racing record = Three- year-old season (1987‚Äì1988) = Super Impose entered training as a three-year- old and made a winning debut in a maiden at Seymour, on 28 December 1987. His next five starts produced three seconds and a third before a let-up. He resumed at Benalla, in early May with a win in an improvers, and his next three starts included a second in a three-year-old handicap at Flemington. Super Impose was yet to win a metropolitan race, but, in coming from last at Flemington, had shown a glimpse of his 'preferred racing style'. He had also shown a dislike for rain-affected going. = Four-year-old season (1988-1989) = Super Impose again resumed at Seymour, in early September, and finished third in a progressive. His next five starts produced as many defeats but included seconds in the Grey-Smith Stakes and the Ballarat Cup. At his next start, Super Impose broke a nine-race losing run and recorded his first Black Type win in the Eclipse Stakes. He was then taken to Sydney for the first time, where he won a welter at Rosehill (over 1,900 metres) and backed-up nine days later to win the AJC Summer Cup on Boxing Day. By this point, the Freedman stable knew that they had 'a pretty smart handicap type horse' on their hands. Back in Melbourne, in the new year, Super Impose raced at weight- for-age for the first time, finishing second to Vo Rogue in the Orr Stakes, the St George Stakes, and the Australian Cup, and won the Carlyon Cup (under handicap conditions) in course-record time. In Sydney, wet weather forced him out of his races over the autumn carnival, including the Mercedes Classic, and the 'dark clouds followed his float' to Queensland, where he was unplaced in two starts before a spell. = Five-year-old season (1989-1990) = In a campaign leading to the Melbourne Cup, Super Impose resumed at Sandown in late August and, after defeats by Apollo Run, Painted Ocean, and Almaarad, broke through in the Turnbull Stakes at his fifth run back. He defeated Research and finished in front of Vo Rogue for the first time. This was followed by midfield finishes in the Caulfield Stakes and the Caulfield Cup and a fourth behind Horlicks in the Mackinnon Stakes. Super Impose carried second-topweight of 56 kilograms in the Melbourne Cup, and, according to Lee Freedman, turned in one of his 'greatest performances'. Freedman recalled that jockey Darren Gauci made 'the best possible use of an inside barrier, got out, had the race won' and was only beaten by Tawrrific, who was 'a little bit better weighted on the day' and 'better equipped' for the distance (3,200 metres).1989 Melbourne Cup result Super Impose opened the new year with a string of placings and was scratched from his main mission, the Mercedes Classic, when wet weather again closed in on Sydney's autumn carnival. He was entered a week later in the Doncaster Handicap carrying topweight of 57 kilograms, and 'the weather held'.Hobson, Warwick (1993) 'Racing's All-Time Greats - Comparing Australia's Champions' (Pages 286-302), Thoroughbred Press-Horwitz Publications Pty Ltd, Super Impose came from the tail of the field on the home turn to defeat Shaftesbury Avenue. He was ridden in the Doncaster by Bruce Compton, who gained the ride only after higher-profile jockeys had taken other mounts, with doubts over whether Super Impose would take his place in the field. This was Compton's first and only ride on the horse, but his tactics and the horse's 'amazing zip' provided a template for success in the big Randwick 'mile' races over the next 18 months. =Six-year-old season (1990-1991)= Super Impose resumed in the Warwick Stakes in late August and defeated Eastern Classic - coincidentally, a horse he had finished second to, as a virtual unknown, almost two years earlier. Super Impose was then runner- up to Stargazer and Shaftesbury Avenue in his next two starts before taking his place in the Epsom Handicap with topweight of 58.5 kilograms. As was the case in the Doncaster Handicap, he was near the tail of the field on the home turn but came down the outside 'like a bullet' to overhaul a line of leaders over the closing stages, including Our Poverty Bay and Ricochet Rosie. Taken to Melbourne to prepare for the Cox Plate, Super Impose's campaign ended abruptly when he bled in the Caulfield Stakes and incurred an automatic three- month ban. The ban also meant that connections were unable to accept the Japan Racing Association's invitation to compete in the Japan Cup. Ultimately, Better Loosen Up won both races and took an unassailable lead in Horse of the Year calculations. Facing the prospect of a lifetime ban from Australian racing if he bled for a second time, Super Impose reappeared in the new year and won one of his three starts - the Chester Manifold Stakes - in Melbourne. In Sydney, he won the Chipping Norton and the Ranvet Stakes for new jockey Darren Beadman, and appeared to be back to his best. Super Impose then stunned the racing community by finishing 'stone-motherless' last of six in the Mercedes Classic. Then chief steward John Schreck explained that they had considered ordering Super Impose to barrier trial before being permitted to race again. Instead, their vets monitored the horse in the lead-up to the Doncaster Handicap, and 'fortunately, everything went right'. Super Impose won the Doncaster Handicap and had his final start for the season when runner-up to Shaftesbury Avenue in the All-Aged Stakes. Super Impose had had the best season of his career, with four Group One wins, including the Epsom and Doncaster Handicaps, and his dam, Pheroz Fancy, was named New Zealand Broodmare of the Year in 1991.New Zealand Broodmare of the Year =Seven- year-old-season (1991-1992)= Now a veteran of 53 starts, Super Impose again resumed in the Warwick Stakes and defeated Livistona Lane and Royal Creation before an unplaced run in the Chelmsford Stakes and a win in the Hill Stakes (which was run at Canterbury Park, with its usual venue, Rosehill, closed for renovations). At his next start, with his win in the Epsom Handicap, Super Impose created history in winning the AJC's Epsom and Doncaster Handicaps two years in a row, in 1990 and 1991. In a moment of 'insanity bordering on genius', Darren Beadman switched Super Impose back to the inside, and he weaved through the field, emerging over the closing stages to veteran racecaller John Tapp's cry of 'He's going to do it, it's history at Randwick!‚Äô In winning each of these races for the second time, he also set modern-day weight-carrying records of 61 kilograms in the Epsom Handicap and 59.5 kilograms in the Doncaster Handicap.Doncaster Handicap resultsEpsom Handicap resultsOnly Gunsynd, who carried the equivalent of 60.5 kilograms in the 1972 Doncaster Handicap, has carried more weight to victory in either race since 1936 Following these wins, Super Impose was named Australia‚Äôs 'Greatest Miler' by racing author Warwick Hobson, and the club named a bar in his honour in the public grandstand at Randwick Racecourse. After the Epsom Handicap, Super Impose campaigned in Melbourne and finished second to Shaftesbury Avenue, Surfers Paradise, and Let‚Äôs Elope in the Caulfield Stakes, the Cox Plate, and the Mackinnon Stakes, respectively. He then finished fourth in the Melbourne Cup under topweight of 60 kilograms and gave nine kilograms to the winner, Let's Elope.1991 Melbourne Cup result Super Impose opened the new year with a second placing to Quick Score in the Apollo Stakes and defeated him second-up with a rails-hugging win in the Chipping Norton Stakes (both run at Randwick Racecourse, instead of their usual venue, Warwick Farm). He was then unplaced in the last four runs of his campaign, including the Doncaster Handicap, where he finished sixth under topweight of 62.5 kilograms and gave 15 kilograms to the winner, Soho Square.Soho Square went on to win six other Group races, including the Chelmsford and the Expressway Stakes at weight-for-age =Eight- year-old season (1992-1993)= In his final campaign, Super Impose again resumed in the Warwick Stakes but was denied a record-equalling third win in the race by Shaftesbury Avenue - who was appearing for the first time since the previous year's Japan Cup and never raced again. Super Impose was then placed in the Chelmsford Stakes and the Hill Stakes, and finished fourth in the Epsom Handicap, under topweight of 61.5 kilograms. He broke an eight-race losing run in the Canberra Cup on his way to Melbourne for the Cox Plate. So easy was the win in that his jockey, Mick Dittman, slowed Super Impose to cantering pace approaching the finish line, more than three lengths clear of the runner-up. In the Cox Plate, veteran jockey Greg Hall took the ride on Super Impose, with Mick Dittman booked to ride the hot favourite, Naturalism. The 'stellar field' of 14 included 12 multiple Group One winners. Kinjite and Slight Chance alternated in the lead, with Naturalism drifting toward midfield, and Let‚Äôs Elope, Better Loosen Up, and Super Impose near the rear. The pace was slow, and the field was tightly packed entering the final 800 metres. Suddenly, Palace Reign clipped heels, and put Naturalism, Sydeston, and Rough Habit out of the race in a chain reaction, while the remainder of the field made for the home turn. Let‚Äôs Elope loomed up with 'a mighty run out wide', stalked by Super Impose, with Better Loosen Up in a pocket to the inside. Better Loosen Up had to check when Let‚Äôs Elope rolled in, and Super Impose came at the leaders to Bryan Martin's call of 'Super! I think Super Impose a nose to Let‚Äôs Elope in the Cox Plate'.1992 Cox Plate result (Note: Due to a successful protest by the rider of Better Loosen Up (fifth past the post) against Let's Elope (second past the post), Let's Elope was relegated from second to fifth, Better Loosen Up was promoted from fifth to fourth, Slight Chance from fourth to third, and Kinjite from third to second) The win took Super Impose to an Australasian record $5.6 million in prize money and gave him the rare feat of Group wins at each of the eight city racetracks in Sydney and Melbourne. He finished his career with a 15th placing in Subzero's Melbourne Cup, 10 days later, but fans simply displayed the reverse-side of their giant banner, which read 'Bad luck Super. We still love you'. He was officially retired in February 1993.  In retirement (1993‚Äì2007)  Super Impose made guest appearances at various racetracks, including Randwick for the Epsom and Doncaster Handicap parades, and Moonee Valley for a Night of Champions in 2005 with Subzero, Doriemus, Saintly, and Brew. He appeared small later in life due to a sway back, common in old horses, but enjoyed running in the paddocks of Glenlogan Park Stud in Queensland as a 'nanny'Life at 20 for Super Impose to some of the farm's young horses. Due to infirmities associated with old age, Super Impose was humanely euthanised in 2007 at the age of 22. He was buried at Glenlogan Park Stud with a tribute stone and plaque erected in his memory.Historic miler put down at 23 In 2007, Super Impose was posthumously inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

Jones had reported anonymously in The Times in 1931 on starvation in Soviet Ukraine and Southern Russia, and, after his third visit to the Soviet Union, issued a press release under his own name in Berlin on 29 March 1933 describing the widespread famine in detail. Reports by Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in 1933 as an anonymous correspondent, appeared contemporaneously in the Manchester Guardian;\\"The Price of Russia's 'Plan': Virtual Breakdown of Agriculture\\". From our Moscow Correspondent. The Manchester Guardian. 12 January 1933, pp. 9‚Äì10. The \\"Moscow correspondent\\" was Malcolm Muggeridge. \\"The Soviet and the Peasantry. An Observer's Notes.

Also see Carynnyk, Marco (November 1983). \\"The Famine the Times Couldn't Find\\". Commentary. his first anonymous article specifying famine in the Soviet Union was published on 25 March 1933. After being banned from re-entering the Soviet Union, Jones was kidnapped and murdered in 1935 while investigating in Japanese-occupied Mongolia, his murder likely by the Russian secret police, the NKVD. Upon his death, former British prime minister David Lloyd George said, \\"He had a passion for finding out what was happening in foreign lands wherever there was trouble, and in pursuit of his investigations he shrank from no risk. ... Nothing escaped his observation, and he allowed no obstacle to turn from his course when he thought that there was some fact, which he could obtain. He had the almost unfailing knack of getting at things that mattered.\\" Early life and education Born in Barry, Glamorgan, Jones attended Barry County School, where his father, Major Edgar Jones, was headmaster until around 1933. His mother, Annie Gwen Jones, had worked in Russia as a tutor to the children of Arthur Hughes, son of Welsh steel industrialist John Hughes, who founded the town of Hughesovka, modern- day Donetsk, in Ukraine.\\"Annie Gwen Jones\\". garethjones.org. Jones graduated from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1926 with a first-class honours degree in French. He also studied at the University of Strasbourg\\"Mr. Gareth Jones: Journalist and Linguist\\". The Times. 17 August 1935. Issue 47145, p. 12. and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he graduated in 1929 with another first in French, German, and Russian. After his death, one of his tutors, Hugh Fraser Stewart, wrote in The Times that Jones had been an \\"extraordinary linguist\\".Stewart, H. F. (19 August 1935). \\"Mr. Gareth Jones\\". The Times. Issue 47146, p. 15. At Cambridge he was active in the Cambridge University League of Nations Union, serving as its assistant secretary. Career =Teaching; adviser to Lloyd George= After graduating, Jones taught languages briefly at Cambridge, and then in January 1930 was hired as Foreign Affairs Adviser to the British MP and former prime minister David Lloyd George, thanks to an introduction by Thomas Jones.Jones, Gareth (31 March 1933). \\"Famine Rules Russia\\". Evening Standard. The post involved preparing notes and briefings Lloyd George could use in debates, articles, and speeches, and also included some travel abroad. =Journalism= In 1929, Jones became a professional freelance reporter, and by 1930 was submitting articles to a variety of newspapers and journals. Germany In late January and early February 1933 Jones was in Germany covering the accession to power of the Nazi Party, and was in Leipzig on the day Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor. A few days later on 23 February in the , \\"the fastest and most powerful three-motored aeroplane in Germany\\", Jones became one of the first foreign journalists to fly with Hitler as he accompanied Hitler and Joseph Goebbels to Frankfurt where he reported for the Western Mail on the new Chancellor's tumultuous acclamation in that city. He wrote in the Welsh Western Mail that if the had crashed the history of Europe would have changed. Soviet Union Commemorative poster for the annual Holodomor Remembrance Day, held on 28 November (2015) By 1932 Jones had been to the Soviet Union twice, for three weeks in the summer of 1930 and for a month in the summer of 1931. He had reported the findings of each trip in his published journalism, including three articles titled \\"The Two Russias\\" he published anonymously in The Times in 1930, and three increasingly explicit articles, also anonymous, titled \\"The Real Russia\\" in The Times in October 1931 which reported the starvation of peasants in Soviet Ukraine and Southern Russia. In March 1933, he travelled to the Soviet Union for a third and final time and on 7 March eluded authorities to slip into the Ukrainian SSR, where he kept diaries of the man-made starvation he witnessed. On his return to Berlin on 29 March, he issued his press release, which was published by many newspapers, including The Manchester Guardian and the New York Evening Post: > I walked along through villages and twelve collective farms. Everywhere was > the cry, 'There is no bread. We are dying'. This cry came from every part of > Russia, from the Volga, Siberia, White Russia, the North Caucasus, and > Central Asia. I tramped through the black earth region because that was once > the richest farmland in Russia and because the correspondents have been > forbidden to go there to see for themselves what is happening. > In the train a Communist denied to me that there was a famine. I flung a > crust of bread which I had been eating from my own supply into a spittoon. A > peasant fellow-passenger fished it out and ravenously ate it. I threw an > orange peel into the spittoon and the peasant again grabbed it and devoured > it. The Communist subsided. I stayed overnight in a village where there used > to be two hundred oxen and where there now are six. The peasants were eating > the cattle fodder and had only a month's supply left. They told me that many > had already died of hunger. Two soldiers came to arrest a thief. They warned > me against travel by night, as there were too many 'starving' desperate men. > 'We are waiting for death' was my welcome, but see, we still, have our > cattle fodder. Go farther south. There they have nothing. Many houses are > empty of people already dead,' they cried. This report was unwelcome in a great many of the newspapers, as some elements of the intelligentsia of the time were still in sympathy with Bolshevism. On 31 March, The New York Times published a denial of Jones's statement by Walter Duranty under the headline \\"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\\". Duranty called Jones' report \\"a big scare story\\". Timothy Snyder writes that \\"Duranty's claim that there was 'no actual starvation' but only 'widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition' echoed Soviet usages and pushed euphemism into mendacity. This was an Orwellian distinction; and indeed George Orwell himself regarded the Ukrainian famine of 1933 as a central example of a black truth that artists of language had covered with bright colors.\\" In the article, Kremlin sources denied the existence of a famine; part of the New York Times headline was: \\"Russian and Foreign Observers in Country See No Ground for Predications of Disaster.\\" On 13 April, Jones published a detailed analysis of the famine in the Financial Times, pointing out its main causes: forced collectivization of private farms, removal of 6‚Äì7 millions of \\"best workers\\" (the Kulaks) from their land, forced requisitions of grain and farm animals and increased \\"export of foodstuffs\\" from USSR. On 13 May the New York Times published a strong rebuttal of Duranty from Jones, who stood by his report: > My first evidence was gathered from foreign observers. Since Mr. Duranty > introduces consuls into the discussion, a thing I am loath to do, for they > are official representatives of their countries and should not be quoted, > may I say that I discussed the Russian situation with between twenty and > thirty consuls and diplomatic representatives of various nations and that > their evidence supported my point of view. But they are not allowed to > express their views in the press, and therefore remain silent. > Journalists, on the other hand, are allowed to write, but the censorship > has turned them into masters of euphemism and understatement. Hence they > give \\"famine\\" the polite name of 'food shortage' and 'starving to death' is > softened down to read as 'widespread mortality from diseases due to > malnutrition'. Consuls are not so reticent in private conversation. In a personal letter from Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov (whom Jones had interviewed while in Moscow) to Lloyd George, Jones was informed that he was banned from ever visiting the Soviet Union again. Japan and China Banned from the Soviet Union, Jones turned his attention to the Far East and in late 1934 he left Britain on a \\"Round-the-World Fact-Finding Tour\\". He spent about six weeks in Japan, interviewing important generals and politicians, and he eventually reached Beijing. From here he traveled to Inner Mongolia in newly Japanese-occupied Manchukuo in the company of a German journalist, Herbert M√ºller.

Legacy =Memorial= On 2 May 2006, a trilingual (English/Welsh/Ukrainian) plaque was unveiled in Jones' memory in the Old College at Aberystwyth University, in the presence of his niece Margaret Siriol Colley, and the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Ihor Kharchenko, who described him as an \\"unsung hero of Ukraine\\". The idea for a plaque and funding were provided by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association, working in conjunction with the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain. Dr Lubomyr Luciuk, UCCLA's director of research, spoke at the unveiling ceremony. In November 2008, Jones and fellow Holodomor journalist Malcolm Muggeridge were posthumously awarded the Ukrainian Order of Merit at a ceremony in Westminster Central Hall, by Dr Kharchenko, on behalf of Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko for their exceptional service to the country and its people. =Diaries= In November 2009, Jones' diaries recording the man-made genocide of the Great Soviet Famine of 1932‚Äì33 went on display for the first time in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. =Depictions in film= Serhii Bukovs'kyi's 2008 Ukrainian film The Living is a documentary about the Great Famine of 1932‚Äì33 and Jones's attempts to uncover it.

History The firm was founded in 1980 by J√∂rg Schlaich and Rudolf Bergermann. They both worked as engineers for the engineering firm Leonhardt, Andr√§ und Partner in Stuttgart in the 1960s and 1970s. It was responsible for the design of the canopy roof structure of the 1972 Olympic grounds in Munich, which was viewed as an aesthetic and structural sensation at the time. Since 2002, Knut G√∂ppert, Andreas Keil, Sven Plieninger, and Mike Schlaich are leading the firm, with the addition of Knut Stockhusen in 2015. The firm has achieved national and international renown through the design of light, minimal and innovative structures that combine structural design with architectural aesthetics. Work The main focuses of the office are the conception, planning and supervision of construction work for portions of structural engineering projects, such as membrane, glass, roof and facade structures, bridges and cable structures, towers, high rise buildings, and exhibition halls. Also included is peer reviewing for structural integrity and structural analysis. The firm also has its own department for the development of technologies of solar power generation and employs consulting engineers for renewable energies. The development and construction of a prototype solar up- draft power plant in Manzanares, Spain was achieved by the solar division of the office in 1982. Likewise, the Dish-Stirling modules for decentralized energy generation have been developed since the beginning of the 1980s. Since 2000 the firm has taken part in the planning and construction of parabolic trough power plants. This technology along with the structures developed by schlaich bergermann partner are currently being employed in a multitude of power plants around the world. A significant point in the history of the firm is the Vidyasagar Setu, commonly known as the Second Hoogly Bridge, in Calcutta, India. Local requirements for the construction of the bridge stipulated the utilization of local, not weldable steel, that was then installed by local manpower with much manual labor. Thus huge cross-sections, including the pylon heads, were assembled using millions of rivets and thick plates. For the soccer world cup in Germany 2006, the Commerzbank-Arena Frankfurt am Main had to be renovated into a new, large-scale sports arena. This necessitated the construction of a mobile roof structure that could be closed across the playing field. In 2004 a new roof with an opening along the longitudinal axis was completed for the Olympic stadium in Berlin, Germany, as well as a new roof for the newly renovated Rhein-Energie-Stadium in Cologne, Germany. The soccer world cup 2010 in South Africa (Cape Town, Durban, Port Elisabeth, Johannesburg) as well as the soccer world cup 2014 in Brazil have also contributed to the firm's growing resume of sport stadiums.

For this gridshell structure the common kitchen sieve was the inspiration: its quadratic mesh grid can be transformed into any desired geometry by altering the mesh grid into a rhombus shape. In combination with a diagonal cable net, the grid transforms into an ideal shell. Clad with glass panes, the result is a lightweight, transparent roof. The glass panes lie directly on the grid beams, thereby merging the load-bearing structure and glass planes. This serves to eliminate the typically necessary secondary structure. The first application of this concept was the Hamburg Museum, which has now been applied, adapted and further developed to suit a multitude of existing interior courtyards, train stations, and new construction projects: Hippo House of the Berlin Zoo, Germany, German Historic Museum in Berlin, DZ Bank Berlin, Palacio de Communications Madrid and Exhibition Centre Milan. =Cable net facades= Hilton Munich Airport For a facade of nearly seamless transparency, parallel cable assemblies span horizontally and vertically in between the sides of the building volumes as well as in between the roof girders and floor of the Kempinski Hotel at the Munich airport. The cable net facade is comparable to a tennis racket. Depending on the degree of pre- tensioning and arrangement of the cable assemblies, a multitude of variations of this structural principle are possible and have been realized: the roof over the Roman Baths in Badenweiler, Germany; CYTS Peking; Main Train Station in Berlin, Germany; Foreign Relations Office in Berlin, Germany; and the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in New York City. =Cable net roofs= Mercedes-Benz Arena interior panorama The cable net roof is the transformation of the primarily single-plane loading of the spoked wheel to vertical load transfer. It combines the characteristics of cable and membrane structures: in between closed, self-anchored tension and compression rings exists a wide-meshed primary load-bearing structure of cables with a secondary membrane structure tensioned in between. One of the first modern cable net roofs is the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Stuttgart. Further examples of this principle are some of the many soccer stadiums worldwide (such as in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Warschau, Kapstadt, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Johannesburg). =Membrane roofs= Most of the cable net roofs are clad with a textile membrane. Textiles allow for lightweight, transparent roofs and facades that fascinate through their variegated and unusual forms. Due to their negligible weight and inherent foldability, textiles are predestined for convertible roofs. One of the first permanently moveable membrane roofs was the one across the bullfighting arena in Saragossa, Spain, which can be closed and opened like a flower within minutes. This same principle was also applied to the \\"largest cabriolet of the world,\\" the roof across the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt. The only things lighter are structures made of air: the pneumatic pillows of the Arenas N√Æmes and Madrid change seasonally within a couple of days or, depending on the weather, within a few minutes. For the new roof over BC Place in Vancouver the principle of foldable membrane roofs was adapted for the first time with pneumatic pillows, which are inflated and deflated during the folding process. =Circular ring beams= Kelheim bridge across the Main-Danube Canal uses a one-sided suspension bridge architecture At the time of its erection, the bent plan-view form of the Kelheim bridge across the Main-Danube Canal caused quite a stir: it was the first one-sided suspension bridge. Meanwhile, the engineers of schlaich bergermann partner have varied this principle of the circular ring beam many times, for projects such as the pedestrian bridge in Bochum; across the Gahlensche Street in Gelsenkirchen; the \\"Balcony to the Ocean\\" in Sassnitz; and the Liberty Bridge in Greenville, South Carolina, USA. For the ZOB Hamburg, this principle was applied to the roof structure. =Cast steel= Nesenbachtal Bridge, Stuttgart uses cast steel structural elements The engineers were a part of the renaissance of cast steel for structural engineering. During the construction of the cable net roofs for the Olympic Games in Munich, this rediscovery made the construction feasible and allowed for the timely completion of the project. The cast steel allows for the production of geometrically complicated pipe nodes and an optimal alignment to the load distribution. Nowadays dynamically curved cast steel nodes are used for street bridges (Nesenbachtal Bridge, Stuttgart) and railroad bridges (Humboldthafen Bridge, Berlin) as well as for high rise buildings (Exhibition Hall 13, Hannover).

Early life and family Johan Nordahl Brun was born in Byneset, just outside the city of Trondheim in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway, on 21 March 1745. He was born to the businessman Svend Busch Brun (1703‚Äì84) and his wife Mette Catharina Nordal. He traveled to Copenhagen in 1767, where he passed his theological examinations. While at the University of Copenhagen, Brun was a prominent member of The Norwegian Society (Det Norske Selskab), a group of younger Norwegian authors, poets and philosophers. He married on 2 September 1773 to Ingeborg Lind. Nordahl Grieg (Johan Nordahl Brun Grieg) was a descendant of the bishop and was named after him. Career After leaving the university, Brun worked for a time as a secretary to Bishop Johan Ernst Gunnerus in Trondheim. He was hired as the chaplain for the parish of Byneset Church in 1772. In 1774, he was called to be the parish priest for the Holy Cross Church in Bergen. He served in this post from 1774 until 1793 when he was promoted to the position of Dean of Bergen and Nordhordland. In 1804, Brun was appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. He served as bishop until his death on 26 July 1816. Literary works In literary history, Brun found his place when he wrote the first Norwegian play, Einer Tambeskielver (1772). This play aroused a strong awakening of Norwegian spirit and was produced many times. He also wrote many poems, including Norway's first (unofficial) national song, \\"For Norge, Kiempers F√∏deland\\", and published a book of Lutheran Hymns (1786). He was also the writer of the city of Bergen's anthem \\"Jeg Tog Min Nyst√¶mte\\".

It was constructed in 1467 to form part of Wongaksa temple, that King Sejo had founded two years before on the site of an older Goryeo-period temple, Heungbok-sa. The temple was closed and turned into a kisaeng house by the (later deposed) king known as Yeonsan-gun (1476 ‚Äì 1506, r. 1494-1506), and under his successor, King Jungjong (1488 ‚Äì 1544, r.1506‚Äì1544) the site was turned into government offices. The pagoda and a memorial stele commemorating the foundation of Wongaksa alone survived. The site of the temple was later occupied by houses. During the Imjin War of the 1590s, the top portion of the pagoda was pulled down and lay on the ground at the foot of the pagoda until it was replaced by American military engineers in 1947. Foreign visitors to Seoul in the late 19th century often went to admire the beautiful pagoda but it was almost inaccessible, hidden in the courtyard of a small house, and in 1897 John McLeavy Brown, the Irish financial advisor to King Gojong, was authorized by the king to turn the area into Seoul's first public park. He called it Pagoda Park, the name it had at the time of the 1919 March 1st Movement. Today the park is known as Tapgol (Pagoda) Park (ÌÉëÍ≥® Í≥µÏõê) and the pagoda stands in a protective glass case. The Korean name literally means \\"ten storeyed stone pagoda of Wongaksa Temple site.\\" The pagoda is considered by art historians to be one of the finest examples of Joseon dynasty pagoda art. The pagoda was designated as the second national treasure of Korea on December 12, 1962. From an inscription on the upper part of the pagoda it is known that the pagoda was built in 1467, the thirteenth year of King Sejo's reign. It is one of the few pagodas made from marble in Korea. Typical Korean pagodas are made from granite, a material abundant on the peninsula. The pedestal supporting the pagoda is three-tiered, and its shape seen from the top looks like a Chinese character, ‰∫û. The first three storeys of the pagoda follow the shape of the base and the next seven storeys are shaped in form of squares. Dragons, lions, lotus flowers, phoenixes, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the Four Heavenly Kings carved on each storey of the pagoda. The pagoda, while made of stone, is carved to look as if it was made from wood. The pagoda has brackets, pillars, and curved roof shapes that imitate a wooden pagoda design. The pagoda was clearly modelled on the beautiful Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda, which was made during the Goryeo Era. Originally erected in 1348 at Gyeongcheon-sa temple on Mt. Busosan in Gwangdeok-myeon, Gaepung- gun, Gyeonggi-do (near Gaesong, now in North Korea), it was taken to Japan in 1907, returned to Korea in 1918, and is now housed at the National Museum of Korea. The first detailed description of the pagoda in English, together with a translation of the inscription on the stele, was published in 1915 by the scholarly missionary James Scarth Gale in the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch's Transactions Vol. VI, part II:1-22 ‚ÄúThe Pagoda of Seoul.‚Äù Gallery File:Tapgol Park Pagoda.jpg File:Wongaksa01.jpgNote the missing top portion.

This special purpose tank was intended to fight on cross country terrain, inaccessible to conventional tanks, acting as a heavy breakthrough tank, and if necessary withstanding even the shockwave of a nuclear explosion. It was planned as a tank of the Supreme Command Reserve.  Design  The tank was developed at the Kirov Plant in Leningrad by a group headed by the engineer L. Troyanov. The work on the tank started in 1957, which was based on a heavy tank operational requirements developed in 1956, and a pre-production tank was completed at the end of 1959. This unique tank boasted increased cross-country capability. It featured four-track running gear mounted on two longitudinal, rectangular hollow beams, which were also used as fuel tanks. The tank suspension was hydro-pneumatic with complex hydrotransformer and three-speed planetary gearbox. The track adjuster was worm-type. The specific ground pressure of this heavy vehicle did not exceed 0.6 kg/cm2 (~8.5psi). The track chain, running practically along the whole track length provided for increased cross-country capabilities on swampy terrain, soft soils and area full of cut trees, Czech hedgehogs, antitank obstacles and the like. The tank was equipped with the powerful 1000 hp 2DG-8M diesel engine, enabling the 60 metric ton tank to attain 55 km/h (34mph) speed, with active range of 300 km (186 miles) on one refuel. It also had auto fire-fighting systems, smoke laying equipment and a combat compartment heating and cooling system. =Armour= The tank hull, with a maximum armour thickness of , was covered by a thin, elliptical shield protecting it against APDS and shaped charge ammunition, and preventing it from being overturned by the shockwave in case of a nuclear explosion. It comprised large cast irregular shape structures of variable thickness and slope. The all-cast front part of the hull was rounded in shape with thin armour panels against HEAT projectiles, which ran around the edges of the front and sides of the hull. The sides of the hull were also cast and had similar protective armour panels. The all-cast turret, with a maximum armor thickness of 319 mm, was rounded and had anti-HEAT protective panels. The turret ring was also heavily protected. The tank was equipped with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) protection. =Armament= The tank was armed with the 130 mm M-65 rifled gun. The secondary armament was a 14.5 x 114 mm KPVT coaxial machine gun with 800 rounds. The weapons were stabilized in two planes by a \\"Groza\\" stabilizer. Object 279 carried 24 rounds of ammunition, with charge and the shell to be loaded separately. The gun was provided with a semi-automatic loading system with a rate of fire of 5‚Äì7 rounds/minute. Firing control system comprised optical rangefinder, auto-guidance system and L2 night-sight with an active infrared searchlight. An improved variant of the gun was later tested on the experimental tank Object 785 in the late 1970s.  History  An Object 279 prototype on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum One of the reasons that this tank project was abandoned, as with other heavy tank projects, was that the Soviet military stopped operating with heavy fighting vehicles of that type, tanks and similar, as of 1960. Since then, the heaviest ones are kept at about 50 metric tons of weight, that is without counting in any extra equipment such as additional reactive armor, mine clearing devices (mine ploughs, mine rollers) etc. On July 22, 1960, at the demonstration of new technology on the range of Kapustin Yar, Nikita Khrushchev strictly forbade any tanks with a weight of more than 37 metric tons to be adopted by the military, having thus written off the entire program of heavy tanks that had proven to be so successful. Adding to this decision was that Nikita Khrushchev himself was a supporter of an alternative ‚Äì guided missile tanks, the most prominent of which was IT-1. Furthermore, the Soviet military wanted tanks with a suitable weight for crossing their own bridges, in case of homeland defence situations similar to those that occurred during World War II, which at that time seemed to be unreliable for heavy vehicle crossings. Another reason was that a number of serious deficiencies of the running gear appeared during the trials. These deficiencies included low nimbleness, efficiency loss during swampy area crossings, complex and expensive production, maintenance and repair, and impossibility of reduction in the overall height of the tank.

It is 576 km by road from Adelaide. The town offers protected beaches for swimming, as well as providing a venue for fishing, boating, sailing, skiing or skin-diving. History Matthew Flinders sailed past on 7 March 1802 and reported 'low front land, somewhat sandy, with raised land inland and of a barren appearance, its elevation diminishing to the northward.' The first land-based European exploration took place in April 1840, when the party of Governor Gawler, John Hill, and Thomas Burr explored the Spencer Gulf coast on horseback, they being the first Europeans to traverse the landward regions of this coast between Port Lincoln and the Middleback Ranges near Whyalla. They roughly followed the route of the present Lincoln Highway. During this expedition Gawler named Cape Burr as well as nearby Mount Hill.Register, 9 May 1840, p.5. The first settlers arrived in 1873 when John Tennant and his son Andrew took up land around the bay, then known as Mottled Cove. The town was first called Carrow and was gazetted in 1903 and laid out in January 1909 by surveyor William Greig Evans. The name 'Carrow' came from an Aboriginal word relating to a soakage rock hole. Some confusion was caused by the similarity of the name to the locality of Warrow (near Coulta on south-western Eyre Peninsula) and the town was renamed Port Neill on 19 September 1940. The name of the town honours a Warden of the Marine Board, Andrew Sinclair Neill. The first jetty was built in 1912 to ship wheat and wool from the district. It was noted in the Observer in June 1910 that settlers in the Hundred of Butler and the district adjoining Mottled Cove were 'anxiously awaiting some movement towards the long promised jetty at that port'. The settlers were suffering greater disadvantages of shipping facilities than most other parts of the west coast at this time. Once the jetty was built, shipments continued until 1970, when shipments by road to Port Lincoln's larger harbour facilities and grain silos commenced. It was noted at the time of construction that the jetty was the largest on the Eyre Peninsula. Geography Port Neill is situated in Mottled Cove at the south end of Dutton Bay near Cape Burr on the western side of Spencer Gulf about north east of Port Lincoln and about north east Tumby Bay. The surrounding region of Port Neill mostly consists of agricultural land, and the coast contains a mixture of white, sandy beaches, vegetated dunes and rocky points. In 1909, surveyor William Grieg Evans noted that the area was covered with \\"low mallee teatree and bushes... light sandy loam red clay over limestone\\".Plan of Hundred of Dixson, pg16, Land Titles Office, South Australia He described it as \\"slightly undulating country\\",Plan of Hundred of Dixson, pg15, Land Titles Office, South Australia which meant the land had a wavelike appearance and form. =Geology= The rocks in Port Neill are of great interest to geologists, as they give prime examples of the Kalinjala Mylonite Zone, and an idea of the processes that occurred 20 km below the surface. Some of the oldest rocks date back to 1850 million years ago, and comprise granite gneisses, amphibolites, and rocks known as pegmatite. Economy The Port Neill jetty and goods shed indicate the town's past as a once busy seaport. Today, much of Port Neill's economy] is derived from the surrounding agricultural] districts, with cereal crops and sheep prominently farmed. Like many coastal towns of the Eyre Peninsula, Port Neill is a well established tourist destination, with town numbers swelling during summer holidays. As well as its history, Port Neill offers a laid back country atmosphere and a number of recreational activities. Fishing is popular from the town jetty, the surrounding beaches and from boats, with boat launching facilities available. A number of other watersports including swimming and snorkelling are on offer in the clean sandy bay. The town has a number of accommodation options, including the Port Neill Hotel, caravan park and various holiday flats and apartments. Community =Demographics= At the time of the 2006 census, Port Neill's population in the town proper was 152, with another 209 in the surrounding district. The vast majority were Australian born and of those that immigrated, all came from the United Kingdom. The most common responses for religious affiliation in the town was Uniting Church 20.4%, Anglican 16.4%, No Religion 15.8%, Catholic 13.2% and Christian, nfd 6.6%. =Facilities= Port Neill has several sporting clubs and recreational facilities, including an oval, tennis and basketball courts, bowling green and golf course, skatepark and a playground on the foreshore. The Lady Kinnaird anchor and a World War II cannon are situated on the foreshore lawns which provide an ideal family picnic spot. In its past the early established town boasted three general stores, butcher's, saddler's, blacksmith's and baker's shops. Today the town currently provides a general store and post office, hotel and pub, and several tourism-based shops. Various walking trails, parks and lookouts are also dotted throughout the area. A small primary school services the town, which caters from Reception to Year 7.

The monastery belongs to the Gelukpa or the Yellow Hat sect and is known for its -high statue of the Maitreya Buddha. The external structure of the building was established in 1850 by the Mongolian astrologer and monk Sokpo Sherab Gyatso, who was head of the monastery until 1905. In 1909, Kyabje Domo Geshe Rinpoche Ngawang Kalsang, popularly called Lama Domo Geshe Rinpoche, succeeded Sherab Gyatso as the head.

Background He was born at √òksendal in M√∏re og Romsdal, Norway. He was the son of parish priest Ole Rein (1729‚Äì1792) and his wife Margretha Hansdatter Ross. She died two weeks after Jonas' birth. In 1763 the family moved to Jevnaker, where his father was hired as vicar. Rein took his examen artium in 1777, and studied at the University of Copenhagen. He started studying theology, but soon switched to literature and philosophy. He graduated in 1780. While a student in Copenhagen, he was a member of the Norwegian Society (Det Norske Selskab), a literary society for Norwegian students in the city. Career In 1780 Rein returned to Norway, working mostly as a private tutor. He debuted as a playwright, but the play did not reach the stage. In 1787 he returned to Denmark to seek a post as a civil servant. After one rejection, he took the cand.philol. degree in 1789. He was appointed as vicar of northern Kautokeino in 1791, but never assumed office; instead he chose to become curate in Skjeberg in 1792. He left in 1799, and in 1800 he became vicar in Eidanger and Brevik. From 1808 he was the vicar of Nykirkenin Bergen. In the meantime Rein had developed into a recognized poet. He published the poetry collections Samlede Digte (two volumes, 1802) and Nyeste Digte (1810). In 1814 he was elected to the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll as a representative with the Bergen deputation, which was led by Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie. He favored the Independence Party (Selvstendighetspartiet), and held animosity towards the proposed Union between Sweden and Norway. The Constituent Assembly elected Crown Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark as King of Norway. However, after the Swedish campaign against Norway during the summer, Norway came into a loose personal union with Charles III John as King . Rein's anti-Swedish sentiments might have cost him the position of Bishop of Bergen, which became vacant in 1816. In 1817 he co-founded the patriotic magazine Den norske Tilskuer together with Christian Magnus Falsen and Herman Foss.Selvstendighetspartiet (lokalhistoriewiki.no) Personal life Rein was married twice. In December 1791 he married Anna Cathrine Arbo (1756‚Äì1794), a grand-aunt of painter Peter Nicolai Arbo. In February 1796 in Berg he married Fredrikke Bergersen (1779‚Äì1856). He had six daughters. He died in November 1821 in Bergen, and was buried at Nykirkeg√•rden.

Champagnat is mostly known for its rugby union team, which currently plays in the Primera A, the second division of the URBA league system. Other sports practised at Champagnat are association football and field hockey. History In 1954, Angel Diez, then professor of Colegio Champagnat, along with other religious from the congregation, registered the rugby team of the college at the \\"River Plate Rugby Union\\" (nowadays Argentine Rugby Union) to play its tournaments. The club began to play at sixth division with a team formed exclusively by pupils of the school. On November 30, 1956, Club Champagnat was officially established, being Lino Landajo the first president. The club had nine competitive teams by then. The club hosted all of its activities at the Champagnat College field, placed in General San Mart√≠n Partido of Greater Buenos Aires. In 1958 the rugby union team won the third division championship, therefore promoting to second division, where it played until 1970. Due to a restructure of the leagues, Champagnat started the 1971 season in the first division. One year later, the club moved to Malvinas Argentinas Partido, where rugby union, field hockey, paddle tennis and tennis courts were built, apart from a swimming pool. In 1982 the women's field hockey section was opened, primarily with the purpose of being an entertainment for its members' daughters due to the club did not have an activity specifically for women. That same year the hockey team played its first official game against Colegio de la Santa Uni√≥n, then playing other schools of the region. The team also toured some Argentine provinces, and then travelled outside the country, having toured on Uruguay (in 2005) and South Africa (in 2009). The rugby team was relegated to second division in 1981, promoted to the top level in 1983, although it was sent back to the second division in 1984. In 1993 the team won again the second division tournament, remaining since then in the first division (Grupo I). The hockey team registered to the Association in 2001, making its debut against Club Ciudad de Buenos Aires. The team won the game by 4-0 and would later win the championship, remaining undefeated at the end of the season.

There is an urban legend of the town once being a frequent spot for hiding police to 'book em' motorists speeding through town. Further to the legend, truck drivers would jettison some of their goods (e.g. a newspaper from a paper truck) next to the hiding spot before speeding off, hence the police focusing on cars. Iron was smelted from locally mined iron ore at a site on Jugiong Creek approximately 3 km north of Bookham in 1874, by the Bogolong Iron Mining Company. Remnants of the blast furnace still exist, one of only three 19th-Century blast furnace ruins in Australia and the only one in New South Wales. It is included in the N.S.W. heritage database. Bookham Post Office opened on 1 September 1864, following the establishment of a mail run from Tumut in 1882. This involved crossing the Murrumbidgee at Roche's crossing.

The university was founded in 1883. In fall 2014, the university enrolled a total of 1,142 undergraduate students and 311 graduate students. History =Founding and early history= On June 5, 1872, pastors and delegates of nine Baptist churches in the Dakota Territory gathered in Vermillion, South Dakota, at the first meeting of the Baptist Association. They adopted the following resolution: \\"Be it resolved that we take immediate steps for the establishment of an institution among us and that we devote a suitable portion of time at each annual meeting of the consideration of this important subject and give our individual associated influence to encourage a more general and complete education of our youth under distinctly Christian influence.\\" Under the name of Dakota Collegiate Institute, secondary and collegiate programs began on September 8, 1883. The institution's name changed to Sioux Falls University in 1885, with the secondary program called the Academy and the collegiate department branded Sioux Falls College. Although the college grew, the academy's enrollment declined, forcing it to close in 1925. Between 1929 and 1931, Sioux Falls College acquired four Baptist schools that had ceased to operate: Des Moines University, Des Moines, Iowa; Grand Island College, Grand Island, Nebraska; Cedar Valley Seminary, Osage, Iowa; and Parker College, Winnebago, Minnesota. With the 1931 merger of Grand Island College with what was still legally Sioux Falls University, the institution's official name became Sioux Falls College. During the Second World War, the college lost its accreditation and offered 200 students, mainly women, two-year degrees. Enrollment surged when the veterans returned home, only to lapse to meager numbers two years later. Financially, the school was in dire straits. =Expansion= Reuben P. Jeschke (1953‚Äì1970) helped regain full, regional accreditation in 1958, and under his leadership enrollment grew from 378 in 1958 to 1,006 in 1968 ‚Äì a 166 percent increase. The institution's endowment, although modest, also grew, and what Jeschke described as a \\"near miracle\\" happened ‚Äì a history of balanced budgets. The most-visible change during this time was the campus. Jeschke oversaw the building of Mears Library, Salsbury Student Union, Salsbury Science Center, Jeschke Fine Arts Center and three residence halls. In fact, Time magazine featured the College's growth in 1967. The caption read: \\"Seven Buildings in Seven Years.\\" The subtitle added: \\"But our stature comes from people.\\" By the end of Jeschke's tenure, Sioux Falls College was well- positioned for the steady success of the 1970s and 1980s. The 1980s saw the addition of a Degree Completion Program and graduate studies. Today, USF offers four graduate programs: Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Education Specialist (Ed.S.) and a joint doctoral degree in leadership with the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minn. USF also offers adult education programs: accelerated nursing and RN-to-BSN. =\\"Naming the future\\"= The 1990s ushered in a new era of excellence. In order to better reflect the board of trustees' desire to \\"name the future\\", one with growth in student body, expansion of academic programs, improvement in facilities and enhancement of the institution's reputation, Sioux Falls College became the University of Sioux Falls, effective January 1995. Dr. Mark Benedetto became the 22nd president in 1997, and under his leadership the university has experienced several years of record enrollment and has added graduate programs in business and education. The number of full-time faculty has also more than doubled. In addition, 14 renovation and construction projects have been added to the 24-acre residential campus and the 82-acre USF Sports Complex at 69th Street and Cliff Avenue. New construction has included the following projects: Cleveland Professional Development Center, Collier Baker Hall, Bill and Marian Sullivan Faith and Living Center, Sports and Fitness Complex, McDonald Center and Salsbury Science Center addition and renovation. In 2008, USF received a $2 million Title III grant from the Department of Education to start a nursing program. This grant provided funds for two simulation labs and renovation of existing science lab facilities. Today the nursing program offers a 15-month accelerated program, an RN-to-BSN program and a traditional undergraduate program. In 2011, the university added the USF Sculpture Walk to its campus and publicly kicked off its fundraising campaign titled the Uncampaign that will run through 2020. =Technology= In 2012, USF built a new Media Studies Center, created a new Music Technology lab for Music majors and added an IdeaLab for Entrepreneurial Studies majors.

Kim Ho Jik was the first Korean person to be baptized in the LDS Church on July 29, 1951 in New York. Two of his children were of the first four Korean people baptized in Korea on August 3, 1952. LDS Church presence and missionary work was officially established on April 20, 1956 with the arrival of two missionaries: Don G. Powell and Richard L. Detton. The Korean Mission opened on July 8, 1962 with Gail E. Carr as the first president of the mission. Successful missionary work led to the growth of the LDS Church in the 1960s and 1970s leading to the organization of the first stake in Korea in 1973 and the dedication of the first temple in Seoul on December 14, 1985. Translation of the Book of Mormon was a lengthy process that commenced in the 1950s, however translators had a difficult time finishing the project. Kim Jo Hik aided translation throughout the process, but the translation was completed by Han In Sang and published on March 29, 1967. A re-translation of the Book of Mormon was completed in 2005. As of 2018, The LDS Church reported 87,860 members, 12 stakes, five districts,and 108 congregations (wards, branches), four missions, and one temple in South Korea. History =1950-1962: The Korean War and missionary efforts= Fresh after being released after president of the Japan Mission, Alma Owen Taylor and missionary Frederick A. Caine visited Korea for a few weeks to determine whether Korea was ready for missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Taylor recognized their increasing interest in Christianity, but wondered if it was purely political interest. This represented the first contact of the LDS Church with Korea; however, the first prolonged influence of the LDS Church in Korea was by United States servicemen stationed in Korea during World War II. The first baptism in Korea was of a U.S soldier. The first Korean member of the church was Kim Ho Jik, who joined the church on July 29, 1951 while obtaining his doctorate at Cornell University.Palmer, Spencer J. \\"Kim Ho Jik\\" in Garr, Arnold K., Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan, ed., Encyclopedia of Latter- day Saint History (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 2000) p. 613 Kim Ho Jik had been sent to New York in 1949 by the South Korean president to learn about nutrition and bring that knowledge back to improve Korea. While attending Cornell, Kim was given a copy of the Articles of Faith by a Latter-day Saint friend. After reading the Articles of Faith, he read the Book of Mormon. He was baptized in the Susquehanna River on July 29, 1951. Kim Tai Whan and Kim Young Sook, his son and daughter, as well as a former student of Kim's and her daughter, were the first four baptisms in Korea on August 3, 1952. Korean citizens who worshiped with U.S. military servicemen at LDS Church services in Pusan and Seoul began to be baptized members of the church. By September 1953, over twenty Korean members had joined the Church in Pusan. After the cease fire, most members moved back to Seoul, which became the center of the LDS Church in Korea. Due to problems maintaining a permanent place of worship, in February 1954, a Korean Sunday School was established with Kim as superintendent. This was the first native Korean LDS organization established in Korea. There were over sixty regularly attending members by April 1954. During this time, most of the members of the LDS Church in Korea were young male students. One of these original members, Han In Sang, later become a general authority of the LDS Church. Sang was also the first native Korean to serve a full-time mission. The Far East Mission (or Japanese Mission) consisted of many Asian countries including Korea, however proselytizing missionaries were only sent to Japan, and not yet Korea. During a visit to Korea in 1955, member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Joseph Fielding Smith dedicated Korea for missionary work on August 2, 1955. Even though the LDS Church was not recognized by the Korean government as an official ecclesiastical organization, Kim became president of the Korean District of the Northern Far East Mission. Additionally, servicemen branches and native Korean branches were separated and church branches were officially created in Seoul and Pusan. Kim helped president of the Northern Far East Mission, Paul C. Andrus, get the Church recognized by the government, lease a missionary house, and obtain the approval of the missionaries' visas. Having been transferred from missions in Japan, Don G. Powell and Richard L. Detton were the first Mormon missionaries in Korea; they arrived on April 20, 1956. Six more missionaries were sent to Korea the following summer; four of them went to Pusan. Due to postwar conditions in Korea, in summer 1958, half of the missionaries became sick with hepatitis. Missionaries had difficulties learning Korean. Church materials such as the Book of Mormon and hymnbooks were not translated into Korean until over a year after full-time missionary work began. Kim translated the Articles of Faith and the sacrament prayers, but missionaries still had difficulties communicating in Korean. Missionaries were sent translated tracts and pamphlets in September 1957, replacing ones in the Japanese language they had been previously using. For the next few years, missionaries were getting about eighteen baptisms a year, which was the highest of any mission at the time. This high rate of baptisms plateaued in 1964. Eighty percent of original converts were male, and this trend continued into the 1970s with over half of converts being male. At first, this was likely due to more contact between servicemen and Korean men. However, after the Korean War, the trend likely continued due to Korea's male-oriented society. Missionary work targeted men rather than women, by policy. After the economic effects of the Korean War began to diminish, Korean's interest in religion diminished as well and baptisms declined beginning in 1965. =Translation of the Book of Mormon= The first attempted translations of the Book of Mormon were done with the Japanese language and recently completed Japanese translation in mind. This caused problems, because Korean people held animosity for the Japanese people due to Japan's recent occupation of Korea due to World War II. Previously, the first copies of the Book of Mormon used in Korea were in English and Japanese. Students learning English were given the English version whereas older individuals were given the Japanese version because Korean people were forced to learn Japanese when they were occupied by Japan. Kim Ho Jik was one of the first involved in the translation process, having already translated the sacramental prayers and Article of Faith. Kim supervised the translation process, working with Chang Se Cheon and Cheong Dae Pan. Kim translated the English into Korean verbally, and Chang wrote down the translation. Due to Kim's other obligations, this was a slow process, so Chang eventually took over the daily translation. Only one half of the book was completed, because Chang moved to Utah in 1959. A second translation was attempted by Hong Byeong Shik and Kim on August 23, 1959; however Kim died of a heart attack eight days later. Hong worked alone as a translator with his wife as his scribe. It is unknown whether Hong referred to Chang's previous translation, but he most likely referred to Japanese versions. After a year, the translation was completed in 1961. Hong was assisted by missionaries and church members during the editing process. The translation was edited and typset around 5 times between 1961 and 1962. Due to the extension revisions necessary, a small pocket edition of 3 Nephi was published before the rest of the manuscript. When Gail Carr became mission president, he allowed missionary Bruce K. Grant to gather opinions on the translation from both Korean members and academics. Grant concluded that the translation should be reworked to more closely match the 1957 re-translated Japanese version. The new Japanese version used clearer language and was less \\"archaic\\" than its predecessor. Cheong became head translator in 1964. After Cheong became Korean district president, conflicting assignments forced Cheong to ask to be released. Lee Ho Nam replaced Cheong. However, Cheong still aided in translation. The Church became concerned that the Church in Korea had already existed for 10 years but there was no Korean translation of the Book of Mormon. Carr asked Han In Sang to revise and complete the translation in 1964. Cheong continued to translate, but consented to Han revising some of his translations. After reviewing Cheong's work, Han decided to re-translate the whole Book of Mormon in 1965; he consulted Hong's published 3 Nephi, Cheong's translation, and the English version. Han completed the draft in 1966. After Carr was released as mission president, the first Korean translation of the Book of Mormon was published on March 29, 1967. Since the Book of Mormon was published in 1967, there have been several editions. The Translation Department of the Church initiated a new translation in the early 1990s, translated from the 1981 English version. A new translation was published in 2005. Including the history and author, little is known about this translation. Due to the new translation, the Church changed its name in Korea from \\"Maril Seongdo Yesu Keuriseudo Kyohoe\\" (The Last Day Saints Church of Jesus Christ\\") to \\"Yesu Keuriseudo Hugi Seongdo Kyohoe\\" (\\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day/Second-term Saints\\"). =1962-1985: Establishment of the Korean Mission and expansion= The first mission in Korea was established on July 8, 1962. Gail E. Carr became the first president of the Korean Mission. At thirty-two years old, he was one of the youngest mission presidents at the time. Korean membership had reached 1,603; there were five branches and nineteen missionaries serving in Korea. Carr initiated the construction of a chapel for the Seoul East Branch; this was one of the first LDS Chapels on the Asian continent. Carr purchased vital church properties, created two new branches, initiated a language study program, and encouraged translation of church materials during his presidency. Carr's wife organized the first Relief Society in Korea. Because they did not yet have translated Relief Society instruction materials, the sisters met and discussed homemaking. After Kim Jung Sook translated the materials, they were able to have formal Relief Society instruction. After Carr, the next three mission presidents were carefully chosen based on academic accomplishment due to the Korean values of education. Spencer J. Palmer began his mission presidency after Carr on August 2, 1965. Palmer had previously served as an Army chaplain in Korea and he was a professor of Korean studies and eastern religions at Brigham Young University. While missionary work and the establishment of the LDS church in Korea had been fairly successful, church membership was unstable due to the large number of student members and Korean leadership was lacking, relying too heavily on the leadership of young American missionaries. On January 2, 1966 Palmer and a Korean District choir participated in a 30-minute program on television that presented song and testimony. Palmer answered common questions about the LDS Church and invited watching citizens to learn about the LDS Church through its missionaries. Other Christmas programs continued on television, radio, and in-person performances. The Korean people responded to these programs very well. Music & the Spoken Word was broadcast in Korea, at the time suggested by Palmer as the only foreign language mission in Asia and perhaps the world in which the program was broadcast to native residents weekly. By 1965, the LDS Church in Korea had one district and seven branches. Four branches were in Seoul, two were in Pusan, and one was in Taegu. In 1968, the Church in Korea was divided into two districts with thirteen branches and three unofficial church gatherings. The Southern District in Pusan was created in February 1968; the Central District remained in Seoul. Because missionary policy required that missionaries focus on heads of families, friends of the Church, and generally older individuals, the average age of the Church increased by five years. More families joined the Church, tithing payment increased, and membership increased from 2,529 in 1965 to 3,317 in 1968. The mission home was constructed in 1966; Palmer insisted that the building parts be entirely made in Korea to show the LDS Church's loyalty to Korea and its industry. Palmer also bought the property in Seoul on which the first LDS temple would be built. In 1966, member of the First Presidency of the LDS Church, Hugh B. Brown became the first general authority to be invited to speak in Korea at Yonsei University. On the last day of Brown's visit, he participated in a flag raising ceremony at the Church headquarters in Seoul. Brown told Korean members of the Church to be proud citizens and to be an example by serving the Lord through serving their country. Robert H. Slover became the next mission president in August 1968. During his service, baptisms increased to around 500 per year, on average. The average number of baptisms per missionary per year at the end of 1969 was 7.1 with nearly one hundred missionaries serving in Korea. New branches and proselyting areas were opened and the Honam District was established. Robert H. Slover became the next mission president in summer 1968. Slover focused on improving the administrative and organizational aspects of the Church in Korea. Under his direction, the number of districts increased to four and the number of missionaries increased from 75 to 125. Baptisms began to increase in 1969, in part, because of the establishment of the Language Training Mission in Hawaii. This allowed missionaries to come to Korea with greater Korean language skills and a greater ability to proselyte and teach the Korean people. Other organizational changes related to missionary work and housing improvements allowed for missionaries that were in better health, better trained, supervised, and motivated. L. Edward Brown became mission president in 1971. In contrast to Palmer and Slover's strategy to send missionaries to every established area in South Korea, Brown believed that concentrating missionaries in large cities and creating strong church centers was the best strategy. Brown also emphasized putting only Korean members in church leadership positions. At the end of Brown's service, the number of missionaries in Korea was 180. Palmer, Slover, and Brown had difficulty obtaining church property and few church buildings were built during their presidencies. In 1973, Spencer W. Kimball organized the first stake. Rhee Ho Nam was named the president of the first stake in Korea. Despite the organization of the stake, it wasn't until 1979 that each ward had their own separate chapel. In 1975 and 1976, the Church Educational System constructed the first Institute building outside of North America. In 1975, The Korean Pusan (Busan) Mission was created with Han In Sang as mission president. Church growth was significant in the 1970s, with Church membership at 12,971 at the end of 1978. Due to growth, the Seoul Korea West Stake was established in 1977. The Seoul East Stake was created April 18, 1979 with the Seoul North Stake created three days later. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square (then the Mormon Tabernacle Choir) first performed in Korea in September 1979. This represented the choir's first tour to the Far East. D. Brent Clement was named president of the newly created Korea Seoul West Mission in 1980, but he was quickly transferred to the Korea Seoul Mission and Kim Cha Bong was named the president of the Korea Seoul West Mission instead. Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the first Korean Temple in Seoul on December 14, 1985. A Missionary Training Center was built next to the temple in the 1986. The fourth mission in Korea was established in 1986 as the Korea Taej≈èn (Daejeon) Mission with Hong Moo Kwang as president. =1988-Present: Recent developments= BYU International Folk Dance Ensemble performed in the Opening Ceremonies of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. In 1991, the one-millionth copy of the Korean translation of the Book of Mormon was sold. Near the end of 1996, there were around 70,000 members of the LDS Church in Korea. Besides Japan, Korea is one of the only countries in the world whose Latter-day Saint community is self-supporting. Members contributed funds to the construction of most of the church buildings and chapels in Korea. In 2001, Dallin H. Oaks met with Korea's prime minister at the time Lee Han-Dong, while at a regional conference in Seoul. In 2010, the Korea Seoul West Mission merged into the Korea Seoul Mission to better allocate resources to the growing LDS Church in Korea. The Missionary Training Center in Seoul closed around March 2013. The Korea Seoul South Mission was created in 2013. In January 2019, the LDS Church announced that the boundaries of the Korea Daejeon Mission would be shifting and it would be merging into another mission in July 2019. In 2020, the LDS Church canceled services and other public gatherings indefinitely in response to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Lovett, Ian. \\"Mormon Church Cancels Services World-Wide Amid Coronavirus Crisis\\", The Wall Street Journal, 12 March 2020. Retrieved on 3 April 2020. Compatibility with Korean culture Plan of salvation in Korean language. Missionary work has been more successful in Korea than many other non-Christian Asian countries. First of all, previous missions to Korea by other Christian denominations prepared Korean people for LDS missionary work. Additionally, the Confucius values embedded in Korean culture have influenced Korea in keeping and maintaining high-quality genealogical records. The LDS Church's emphasis on genealogy and family history allows Korean members to respect and honor their ancestors by completing ceremonies for them in LDS temples. Furthermore, other emphases of the LDS Church such as education, the eternal nature of the family, and temple work have been very appealing to the Korean people. Moreover, LDS missionary success in the early history of the Church in Korea was influenced by the political and economic turmoil surrounding the Korean War. Suffering and hardship caused the Korean people to look to other religious and philosophical sources for answers to their questions. Although the deeply-rooted Confucian and Buddhist traditions and values in Korea are beginning to change, there are a few aspects of Korean culture that are causing problems for the LDS Church in Korea. First, education in South Korea and entrance examinations into higher education require a lot of time for students in order to succeed. Although the LDS Church tends to support the success of its members as well as high educational goals, Church leaders have been concerned that students do not have time to attend Church or develop their faith. Second, marriage in Korea is often regulated by parents, using the principles of kunghap, similar to astrology, in which compatibility of couples is determined by the year, month, day, and hour in which someone is born. This is different from LDS values which encourage marriage, and especially marriage to another member of the Church. Statistics and other information As of October 2018, the LDS Church reported 87,860 members, 4 missions, 17 family history centers, 12 stakes, 108 congregations with 65 wards and 43 branches, and 1 temple. =Missions= *Korea Busan Mission *Korea Daejeon Mission (Merging July 2019) *Korea Seoul Mission *Korea Seoul South Mission (Created July 2013) =Temple= April 14, 1985, the Korean Temple of the church was dedicated. In the LDS Church, there is a distinction between a meetinghouse and a Temple. By 1985, there were numerous meetinghouses but only one temple in Korea. } See also *Christianity in Korea *Religion in Korea Citations Bibliography   * External links * LDS Newsroom: Country Profile: South Korea * Deseret News 2010 Church Almanac (Republic of Korea) * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - Official Site - South Korea (Korean) * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - Official Site - Worldwide (English) * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - Visitors Site Christianity in Asia ","title":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Korea"},{"id":"4990501","text":"Seondeok of Silla may refer to: People *Queen Seondeok of Silla, reigned 632‚Äì647 *King Seondeok of Silla, reigned 780‚Äì785 Media *Queen Seondeok (TV series), 2009 South Korean historical drama TV series.

After their first two original titles, The Rift and Waterdogs, received poor reception in the comics market, they looked to adapt George R. R. Martin's fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. However Martin suggested they first adapt his novella that appeared in Robert Silverberg's Legends anthology, The Hedge Knight, which served as a prequel to the A Song of Ice and Fire series. When The Hedge Knight was first released in August 2003 it received positive reception and success in sales. During the six issue run, the studio ended their partnership with the original publisher of the series, Image Comics, and the series switched to Devil's Due for the remainder of its run. The Hedge Knight graphic novel collection went on to become one of the best-selling graphic novels of 2004. Following their success with The Hedge Knight the Dabel Brothers began acquiring more literary fantasy licenses. After contacting other authors that featured in the Legends anthology they received deals from three of these authors: Robert Silverberg, Raymond E. Feist and Tad Williams. They began production on Silverberg's The Seventh Shrine, Feist's The Wood Boy, and William's The Burning Man. These three productions were originally to be published by Devil's Due but were canceled due to a contract dispute between Roaring Studios and Devil's Due. The split resulted in only one of two issues of The Wood Boy being published. Around the same time the Dabel Brothers lost the right to Dragonlance: Legend of Huma after only five issues were published due to issues with themselves and Hasbro. Devil's Due later acquired the license from Hasbro which included all the Dragonlance properties. They then packaged the final issues of the Huma mini-series, but the remainder of the book remains unadapted. Roaring Studios was renamed to Dabel Brothers Productions. After their departure from Devil's Due, they aligned with Alias Enterprises to publish XIII. Alias' head creative director is Mike S. Miller who had been partnered with the Dabel Brothers prior to Alias' existence, dating back to the companies series of The Hedge Knight. The partnership later came to an end and the companies went through a public break. During this time the Dabel Brothers were working in conjunction with Red Eagle Entertainment to produce issues of Robert Jordan's New Spring. However, after five issues the parties came into disagreement with the Dabel Brothers alleging that Red Eagle failed to make payments for production and Red Eagle alleging that the Dabels were unable to complete the series in a timely fashion. The issue went into arbitration in court with the Dabel Brothers keeping the rights to the Wheel of Time series. In 2006, they increased production to seven separate monthly titles with plans to add to the line up in the future. Four months into publication the Dabels suspended publication due to negotiation with Marvel Comics which resulted in a partnership between the two companies. As their deal was being finalized with Marvel, the Dabel Brothers continued to negotiate with other authors to bring their works to comics. Dabel Brothers Production increased production from four to six books per month in addition to trade paperback and hardcover collections of their adaptions under their alliance with Marvel. The imprint continued to focus on licensed adaptations of works by science fiction and fantasy authors along with their original material. The Dabel brothers handled the editorial side of Dabel Brothers Productions while Marvel handled the marketing and publishing. In August 2007, Marvel and Dabel Brothers Production mutually agreed to part ways, with Marvel retaining the rights to the series that were in production so they could be finished to the authors' happiness. In November 2007, Dabel Brothers signed a deal with the Del Rey imprint of Ballantine Books to handle the distribution of their graphic novels to the bookstore trade. This partnership has led to The Dresden Files: Storm Front Vol. 1 and Mercy Thompson: Homecoming titles to make the New York Times Bestsellers list. Mercy Thompson: Homecoming spent nine weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers list. The Dresden Files original graphic novel The Dresden Files: Welcome to the Jungle was nominated for a 2009 Hugo Award. In 2008, they were under contract to produce the 2009 calendar for the Song of Ice and Fire series, also by George R.R. Martin. However, due to production delays with the calendar's painter and shipping problems that arose many people who had preordered in 2008 did not receive their 2009 calendars in the timeliest of manners. Martin spoke candidly of the incident on his blog and he subsequently terminated his contract for the calendars. Dabel Brothers and George R.R. Martin continue to work on the Wildcards: Hard Call series whose final issue and graphic novel was released by Dynamite Entertainment in 2010. A December 2009, announcement revealed that Dynamite Entertainment would be entering into a publishing deal with Dabel Brothers Publishing (for an unknown number of years), where they would be taking over the production of Dabel Brothers titles. Dynamite Entertainment has subsequently taken over production and payments and has become the publisher of record for all Dabel Brothers titles. The first of the Dynamite/Dabel Books was released in April 2010. Publications =Licensed properties= George R. R.

The theory relies on the concept of persuasion. The goal of altercasting is to project an identity, (to be assumed by other(s) with whom one is in interaction), which is congruent with one's own goals. Because of the flexibility of altercasting, it is used frequently in advertising and health promotion. Through psychological, societal, and unnoticed manipulation; an individual's likelihood of playing out a specific social role is more inclined to happen. Assumptions and key differences People can be persuaded by altercasting because it targets both the social role and ego of a person, which are two of the most crucial and fundamental elements of day to-day life. Furthermore, Altercasting can be positive or negative and still stimulate similar effects. Altercasting can be broken into two sub groups: manded altercasting and tact altercasting. Manded altercasting is when a new or existing role is made more prominent and told directly to people. Examples: \\"You as a broadcast major should...\\" \\"You look to me as someone who values humility...\\" Tact altercasting is a more passive way in forcing people to accept certain roles. This is when we tend to act in certain ways that could trigger others to take a specific role. Examples: When someone tends to be needy, another person is forced to be generous and caring. When a group of kids is in chaos, one of them is forced to assume the role of a leader. Dimensions There are six processes that can be combined to create a successful altercasting, under both subgroups. The ego in each tactic is the individual induced into manipulation, while the alter is the idea/ role one wants to enforce. #Structural Distance: the physical proximity of the Alter idea in regard to the Ego. For the majority of individuals, a closer distance will promote more alter influence. #Evaluative Distance: the more authoritative qualities or dominance an Alter has; the easier it is to exert influence over the Ego. #Emotional Distance: the Alter casts into a role in which the role is presumed to be involved with an Ego's feelings, needs, and everyday concerns. This plays deep into the psychological nature of the mind. #Support vs Support Seeking: there are two cases here, either that the Alter is in an identity requiring Ego's help or assistance or, at the other extreme, being required to give aid and comfort to Ego. In the former, manipulation into a certain role is more common. Self-presentation and altercasting clearly merge on this dimension. #Interdependence vs Autonomy: the extent to which Ego projects Alter as being tied to him by bonds of common fate, perspective, or concurrence of interests. #Degree of Freedom Allowed Alter: the range of behavior Ego allows Alter within the encounter. Each action is ultimately directed at narrowing Alter's choice of responses so as to increase the probability of eliciting the task response. Impact on society Altercasting messages are important to study, not only because they are prevalent in our society, but also because altercasting messages rely on the social psychological construct of social roles. With a free market we are pummeled with advertising daily, not all altercasting messages are driven this way, but a vast majority are used as advertising. As a society, we are exposed to as many as 5,000 advertisements a day. By no means are all of these directly connected to altercasting, yet a majority of advertisers are using sneaky tactics to sell products. For example, advertisers might say a 35-year-old woman should care about being a good mother. And, coincidentally a good mother has a big enough vehicle to drive her children and their friends around after soccer practice. Therefore she should buy the newest van coming out. People identify themselves by what they buy, if they are manipulated into buying products‚Äîthe way they see themselves can leave lasting impacts if they notice what is happening. Impact on the mind The mind fills in the roles we play by many factors; especially by the products we own. Behavior is subjective and case-by-case; the reasoning behind why we do something is still being developed. However, altercasting has been shown to have massive effects on behavior change. If behavior is changing, a link to psychological diseases like schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder could be one piece of the base explanation for these mental illnesses. Altercasting is a subgroup to the role theory. Some roles are naturally absorbed into a person's identity, while others are influenced and pressured to arise. The manipulation factor is contributed through altercasting. With altercasting, the manipulations of factors (positive and negative) must be present for certain roles to occur. Once accepted by individuals, roles exert a variety of social pressures on them to make certain that the roles are carried out. People must act in accordance with the roles to maintain a positive image and sustain the interaction. Accordingly, altercasting may function by capitalizing on our reliance on general social roles as a means to gain compliance. Altercasting is a strategy, frequently used in advertising and health promotion, for persuading people by forcing them in a social role, so that they will be inclined to behave according to that role.

Populations from the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands formerly classified in V. indicus are now considered to comprised two distinct species. It grows to lengths of . Names It is known as wbl yb in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea.Bulmer, RNH (1975). Kalam Classification Of Reptiles And Fishes. Journal of the Polynesian Society 84(3): 267‚Äì308.  Taxonomy  Head of a mangrove monitor, National Museum of Natural History (France). The mangrove monitor was first described by the French herpetologist Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1802. Daudin's original holotype of a subadult specimen was collected on Ambon, Indonesia, and has since disappeared from the museum in Paris. Daudin's original name for the species was Tupinambis indicus, an appellation it would carry for 100 years until being renamed as a Varanus. The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral (Ÿàÿ±ŸÑ), which translates to English as \\"monitor.\\" Its specific name, indicus, is Latin for the country of India, but in this instance it relates to Indonesia or the East Indies, where the animal was first described. Due to its large geographic range, V. indicus is considered a cryptic species complex of at least four species: Varanus indicus, Varanus doreanus,Varanus spinulosus, and Varanus jobiensis. More research is being done on possible future species within this complex, not surprisingly, since it has had over 25 different scientific names since it was first described. Distribution and habitat The mangrove monitor's range extends throughout northern Australia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands, where it inhabits damp forests near coastal rivers, mangroves, and permanent inland lakes. It also occurs on the Moluccan islands of Morotai, Ternate, Halmahera, Obi, Buru, Ambon, Haruku, and Seram in Indonesia. Within this range of thousands of miles across hundreds of islands are large variations in size, pattern, and scalation. The monitors have also been introduced to Japan since the 1940s. Like the introduction to Japan, some herpetologists believe this animal's dispersal from the East Indies to smaller Pacific islands was facilitated by Polynesians to provide a meat supply. However, other scientists maintain this is not likely, as the monitors would compete with man for food, grow slowly, and yield little meat. Anatomy and morphology thumb juvenile The monitor's body is dark green or black in color and covered with golden-yellow spots, with light coloration on the top of its head and a solid, cream-colored belly lacking dark markings. It has a distinct dark purple tongue and serrated teeth.Bennett, D. (1995). A Little Book of Monitor Lizards. Aberdeen, U.K.:Viper Press. The mangrove monitor attains different sizes in different parts of its range, but seldom if ever exceeds 1.3 m in total length. Australian herpetologist Harold Cogger gives a total length of 100 cm for Australian specimens.Cogger, H. (1967). Australian Reptiles in Colour. Sydney: A.H. & A.W. Reed, The tail is almost twice the length of the body and laterally compressed to aid in swimming. Like the rest of the lizard's body, it is covered with small, oval, keeled scales. This monitor has the ability to increase the size of its mouth by spreading the hyoid apparatus and dropping the lower jaw to eat large prey, a process similar in appearance to that of snakes, although the jaw of the mangrove monitor remains rigid.King, Dennis & Green, Brian (1999). Goannas: The Biology of Varanid Lizards. University of New South Wales Press. . The mangrove monitor possesses a Jacobson's organ, which it uses to detect prey, sticking its tongue out to gather scents and touching it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted. The mangrove monitor is one of only two species of monitor lizards that possess salt-excreting nasal glands, the other being V. semiremex, which enables them to survive in saltwater conditions and to consume marine prey. The presence of this gland probably enabled the monitors to reach new islands and aid in its dispersal throughout the Pacific. Diet The mangrove monitor is an opportunistic carnivore, feeding on the eggs of reptiles and birds, mollusks, rodents, insects, crabs, smaller lizards, fish, and carrion. Mangrove monitors are the only monitor capable of catching fish in deep water.Traeholt, C. (1993). \\"Notes on the feeding behaviour of the water monitor, Varanus salvator.\\" Malay. Nat. J. 46: 229-241. In some parts of its range, it is known to eat juvenile crocodiles. Mangrove monitors in the Southern Mariana Islands shifted major prey classes when their regular prey began declining. The monitors were known for eating shrews on Guam, but the introduction of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) led to decreased shrew numbers, prompting the monitors to switch to eating invertebrates and foraging through human garbage. Reproduction The species lacks distinct sexual dimorphism, but mature male monitors on Guam have been reported to be three times the mass of mature females. Males fight for females, and in one observation, after mounting the female, the male used his chin to rub the dorsum of the female's head and forequarters. While mounted and oriented head to head, the male and female slowly rotated in a clockwise direction through 360¬∞, with the male remaining superior. Female mangrove monitors lay two to 12 eggs that measure 3.5 to 5 cm in length. The oblong eggs are white, and hatch in about seven to eight months.Bennett, Daniel (1998). Monitor lizards: Natural history, biology & husbandry. Edition Chimaira. . The first successful captive breeding of this species was at the Philadelphia Zoo in 1993. The Reptilian Zoo in Vlissingen, the Netherlands, was reported to have successfully hatched eggs by a female animal which was not in any contact with a male of the same species. Contact with humans Humans have introduced the mangrove monitor to a number of Pacific Islands since the 1930s. They have been present on Ifaluk in the western Caroline Islands since the Second World War.Uchida, T. (1967). Observations on the monitor lizard, Varanus indicus (Daudin) as a rat control agent on Ifaluk, Western Caroline Islands. Micronesica 3(1):17-18 The Japanese introduced the lizards to the Marshall Islands prior to World War II to eliminate rats; the lizards flourished and soon began to raid the local chicken houses.Dryden, G. (1965). The food and feeding habits of Varanus indicus on Guam. Micronesica 2(1):73-76. When American troops arrived, the locals asked them for help in getting rid of the mangrove monitors. The US response was to introduce the marine toad (Bufo marinus) which proved toxic to the lizards. As the monitor population dropped, however, the rat population began to rise. The mangrove monitor is hunted in many places for its skin, which is used for leather in making drum heads. Although international trade in this species is small, Mertens referred to it as one of the most heavily exploited monitor lizards. Sprackland, R. G. (1993). Rediscovery of a Solomon Islands monitor lizard (Varanus indicus spinulous) Mertens, 1941. Vivarium 4(5):25-27. In 1980, trade in over 13,000 monitors was declared. However, in many remote places, they are used as a food source and are killed because of their reputation for preying on domestic animals. An ethnic group on Guam eats the monitors as a traditional food, and a business there sells monitors for food. The United States Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Animal and Plant Inspection Service announced it will use a combination of two poisons, diphacinone and brodifacoum, to kill off the rodents on Cocos Island (Guam). They will also attempt to lower the mangrove monitor population on Cocos Island by 80%, using several trapping methods proposed by herpetologist Seamus Ehrhard, as the lizard is believed to prey upon the endangered Guam rail (Gallirallus owstoni). Most locals, however, do not see the monitor as an invasive species and a few activists are opposed to the attempt to lower the population there. Mangrove monitors are often kept in zoos and private collections, as they are an active and alert, and generally can be handled if tamed properly. Most specimens defecate on their handlers when stressed. With proper care they can live up to 20 years in captivity.Sprackland, Robert (1992). Giant Lizards. TFH Publications. .

It is about in length and weighs about . It is found in tropical rainforests, near its preferred habitat of rocky outcrops. The female's plumage is brownish / dark smokey grey in colour, and generally less noticeable coloured than the males because of their nesting work in rocky areas. The male's feathers are a bright orange. Both have a heavy body, broad based bill and wear a remarkable half-moon crest on the head. It is one of two species of the genus Rupicola, the other being the Andean cock-of-the-rock. The Guianan cock-of-the-rock lives across the forested region of northeastern South America. Its diet consists mostly of fruit, but sometimes includes small snakes and lizards. The female Guianan cock-of-the-rock breeds in the early months of the year and, on average, lays her eggs around March. The females choose a mate by flying down to the ground and pecking the male on his rump. The male then turns around and the mating takes place almost immediately. During the height of the mating season, males engage in competitive displays in lek, which is a complex courting behaviour that is done to attract females. Males and females live separately except when the females choose a mate. The mating success varies based on multiple factors, ranging from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. There is speculation that the male-to-male competition is an important factor in lek formation and breeding. The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles and black-and-white hawk-eagles. Description Male Guianan Cock-of-the-rock perched, showing a frontal view of the eccentric crests. The Guianan cock-of-the-rock is a stout-bodied bird with a prominent half-moon crest. It is a sexually dimorphic bird. The male's crest is more pronounced than the female's and is bright orange. The males also have an orange-tipped black tail, black, orange and white wings, a bright orange bill, an orange iris yellowing as it nears its outer edge, and silky- orange filamentous feathers of the inner remiges. Both sexes also have orange legs and skin. The less conspicuous female is dark brownish-grey overall and has a yellow-tipped black bill, a duller orange iris, and a smaller crest. One-year-old juvenile males look similar to an adult female, but has orange speckles over their bodies. After two years, the juvenile males become mostly orange with brown and grey spots. Males attain their definitive plumage at around three years. Juvenile females look almost identical to their adult counterparts. Guianan cocks-of-the-rock have a total length of approximately and a total weight of around .Richter, W. and G. M. Kirwan (2011). \\"Guianan Cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola). Neotropical Birds Online. T. S. Schulenberg, Ed. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. The two species of cock-of-the-rock are allopatric, and therefore do not meet with one another. The plumage of male Andean is redder and its wings are mostly black, lacking the orange colouration seen on the male Guianan. The female Andean is reddish brown rather than the brownish-gray of the Guianan. Etymology The generic and specific names are derived from the Latin words rupes \\"rock\\" or \\"cliff\\", and cola \\"inhabiting\\", which express its habit of nesting on rock walls.  Taxonomy  The Guanian cock-of-the-rock is one of two species of genus Rupicola. It was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 as the type species of its genus. Its closest relative and congener, the Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), is similar in body shape and colouration, though the two are wholly allopatric from each other. Their closest family relatives are the Red cotingas (Genus Phoenicircus). The two Rupicola species are in the subfamily Rupicolinae, which also includes other species of cotingas such as the before-mentioned Red cotingas (Genus Phoenicircus, which is a sister genus to Rupicola), Snowornis pihas, and the berryeaters (Genus Carpornis). Range and Habitat Male in its lush, tropical habitat. As suggested by its name, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is found in the Guianan Shield, occurring in French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, southern Venezuela, eastern Colombia and northern Amazonian Brazil. Its preferred habitats are humid forests near rocky outcrops. They are normally found at an altitude of . The Guianan cock-of-the- rock has distinctive territorial markings. Males usually take dominance of an area on the ground, although sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a ‚Äúcourt‚Äù. Quality of courts are known to have some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center of activity in the lek. The reason for the focus on the center of activity in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas. Guianan courts are commonly found in the Guianan Shield, a forested region in northeastern South America.del Hoyo, I., Elliott, A., & Christie, D.A. eds. (2004). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Vol. 9. Cotingas to Pipits and Wagtails. Lyns edicions, Barcelona. p. 751 Ecology and Behavior =Diet= The diet of the adult Guianan cock-of-the-rock consists mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous. Up to 65 species of fruit have been reported in their diet, primarily from canopy trees or lianas. Three quarters (75%) of the fruit eaten by the Guianan cock-of-the-rock at one study site were either black- or red-coloured fruit. In the British Guiana, E. Thomas. Gilliard found papayas growing at the base of a huge rock. On top of the rock were perched females that were nesting. He found that no other papayas were growing in that part of the forest and speculated that the perched females ate papayas in the forest where they are native and dropped the seeds below where they were nesting. Small snakes, lizards, insects and frogs are occasionally found in its diet. By selectively feeding on nearby fruit trees and then defecating or regurgitating the seeds within the leks, these birds can actively influence the regeneration and succession of the forest habitat where they breed. =Breeding= Closer view of the male's crest and ornamental feathers. Guianan cocks-of-the-rock breed early in the year, and the females lay their eggs around March, nesting in rocky areas. During the height of mating season, males gather in leks with multiple males defending a social display arena of much greater area than that of a lone male. The males each have their own area on the forest floor where they make their courts. The size of each court is about in diameter, and the next bird is often about away. The females and males live separately; only when it is time to mate do females fly over to observe and choose a male. When this occurs, the females tap the males from behind and insemination quickly follows. When females approach a lek, the males stand firmly and present themselves rigidly. Mating success is dependent on a variety of factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the- rock displayed sexual selection based on sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a ‚Äúpool‚Äìcomparison‚Äù tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice. Nesting Unlike other species of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves rather than in the trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material, which is attached by saliva to a vertical rock. The female takes care of the building and maintenance of the nest, the incubation of the eggs and the parenting. The male does not participate at all. Eggs typically incubate for 27‚Äì28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins. Mating Behavior Illustration by Jacques Barraband showing male plumage. The smaller of the two cocks-of-the-rock, the male Guianan takes the lesser part in breeding. It is polygynous and has nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where 40 or more males may gather to challenge rivals and beckon to the females. The displaying male purposely contrasts itself from the forest, shows its crest and plumage so much that the bill and tail become obscured; almost making it difficult to recognize as a bird, to attract females. Within the lek, each female has its own perch on a low branch, while the males own a \\"court\\" on the ground below that is cleared of dead leaves by the draughts of each male taking off and landing. The males have a variety of calls and movements, showing off the crest, elongated filaments on the rump, secondary feathers, and the snapping of their bills. Males display on branches about from the ground until a female approaches, when the males display and call from individual plots on the ground. Most males copulate with only a few females. However, some are very successful and may copulate with many. Unlike many other bird species, the male does not use resources nor parental care to entice females.Alexander, R.D. and Tinkle, D.W. eds. (1981) Natural Selection and Social Behavior: Recent Research and New Theory, Chiron Press. pp. 138‚Äì169. . Males often engage in courtship disruption practices. In a study conducted by Pepper W. Trail, the interactions between adult males, females, and yearlings were observed and linked to mate choice and male dispersion patterns within leks. Adult males produced this disruptive behaviour with varying intensity, which depended on the situation. In lower-intensity disruptions, males usually directed their aggression or threats towards neighboring males, in attempts to improve or maintain breeding status and success. The males that were hassled tended to be more successful and often were disrupted with much greater frequency than males with lower mating success. Higher-intensity disruptions were used by less successful males and directed towards females that wandered by. This behaviour is suggested to have the effect of redirecting females towards the hassling male. Yearlings often disrupted courtships of the more mature adults on the basis of practice for future courtships, since the yearlings do not possess any territory within the lek. Female disruption was an uncommon event that had little, if any, effect on the accessibility of a male. Young males of highly promiscuous species such as the Cock-of-the rock often failed to mate in their first year, probably because older, more experienced males will enjoy the majority of matings. In this strong system of sexual selection, the successive breeding of dominant and aggressive males leads to high sex drives and the endurance of polygyny. A theory suggests that the selection of these aggressive males also puts a premium, or value, on female characteristics. Hence, there is a less likely occurrence of female‚Äìelicited aggression. Male Guianan cock-of-the-rock \\"delight in homosexuality\\" with almost 40 percent engaging in a form of homosexual activity and a small percentage never copulating with females.Bagemihl, Bruce (1999). Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity. St. Martin's Press, page 566-569. https://www.livescience.com/16138-gay-animals-bonobos-dolphins.html Ecological Consequences One possible advantage to lek formation (in Guianan cock-of-the-rock and other species) is severe selection and consequent rapid evolutionary advancement, all of which is possible due to the high expendability of males. Only a few males are needed to fertilize the next generation. The courtship behaviour is similarly theorized to have arisen from differences in division of labour between the two sexes. Females expend their energy on building nests and rearing young, while males spend most of their time and energy of finding mates and caring for their plumage. Guianan cocks- of-the-rock form large leks, averaging 55 adult males. The males in these display leks were especially vulnerable to attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, due to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks and the size of leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the- rock males was less likely to flush or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive. There is speculation that the simulation of male-male competition is important in lek formation and breeding. Impact of Natural and Sexual Selection on Trait Development The colouration of the males allows them to visibly stand out from the brown forest floor. This bright colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in the males. The bright colouration also makes the males more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; only a small number of males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to bright plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage-protection from predation. Conservation Fairly common in its large range, and with its population stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least Concern on its red list of threatened species. The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, black-and-white hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, bald eagles, golden eagles and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although these are the main predators, four species of owls, crested owls, Blakiston's fish owls, northern eagle-owls and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, mountain lion, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa constrictor, tiger rat snake, and fer-de-lance. The species is rare in captivity, but breeding has been achieved at a small number of facilities. The world's first successful captive breeding was at Dallas World Aquarium (USA) in 2008. = Predation Response = In larger lek groups there is less risk of predation. In a group there are more individuals to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal when there was a snake.

History =The beginning= The history of Plaid Retina begins in 1984, in Visalia, a small city in California Central Valley, when drummer Don Hudgens joined metal band Oblivion, a high school band established by Travis, Jeff Gilley, \\"Bryan T\\" Thompson, Alarick Garcia and Mike Matthews. The crew for that band also included Matt Morris and Jeff Beck. It was at this time Hudgens and Matt Morris met up with Kelly Casper, who was part of that scene at Redwood High School. Even though the band was not from Los Angeles, the band managed to keep up with the underground scene in Los Angeles (150 miles from Visalia), which was what made them unique in their small-town local scene. Heavy Metal's definition, however, was about to be shattered by a plethora of different influences. The advent of hardcore punk acts such as Minor Threat and the Suicidal Tendencies, whose first album made a huge impression of the metal scene, caused the members of the band to splinter. =Misc.= In 1985, after the breakup of Oblivion, Hudgens and Morris decided that if they joined forces, they might be able to accomplish their own band, so they gave it a shot and set up shop in an old railroad boxcar that Morris' parents, Bill & Brenda, were using as a shed, located in a huge backyard away from the neighborhoods. They convinced Kelly Casper to join in on bass with Matt playing guitar and singing. This incarnation was called \\"Misc.\\", which happened to be scribbled on the first cassette tape they recorded on. The music clearly was leaving metal behind and headed full speed toward hardcore punk and skate rock. The music was played and performed as brash and as abrasively as they could possibly deliver it, and recorded with a 'ghetto- blaster' onto very old used cassette tapes that were actually found in the boxcar, with vocals by both Morris and Casper sung directly into the built-in microphone. Gary Stallions also played second guitar for an appearance at a Redwood High School talent show. They were kicked out of the talent show when panic ensued because no one other than the punk scene knew what was going on when the fast music and slam dancing erupted. =Aggravated Assault= Casper had to leave the band amicably, so Don Hudgens brought in Rob Anderson, who grew up with him during their teens and knew Matt Morris from the local BMX scene on that side of town years earlier around 1982. They changed the name to Aggravated Assault, the band then started to gravitate toward Fresno, California, a city 40 minutes north which had an active punk scene, shops and interesting places to skate, especially in its classic downtown area. Hudgens and Morris posted a flyer at \\"The Record Factory\\" which led to their first real gig at the legendary Knights of Columbus Hall, opening for the Wimpy Dicks (San Luis Obispo) and the Sea Hags. Repeated trips to Fresno led them to meet Dale Stewart of Capitol Punishment at his record store in Fresno, Stage Dive Records, which although not in Visalia, became one of the bands favorite hang outs whenever they could get a chance to be there. Releases =Plaid Retina= Stewart convinced the band to change its name to Plaid Retina (the name itself was a group decision), mostly to help them grow just in case they grew out of the piston-pumping D.R.I. style rhythms, which proved to be sound advice. Stewart connected them with the studio A.I.R. (Audio Image Recording) in Fresno at Van Ness and Bremer owned by Gray Gregson. This was the team that recorded the self-titled debut album, Plaid Retina, that when pressed was actually a little 7\\" but was in fact a formidable full-length album (relatively speaking). Plaid Retina was a furious debut with a devastating rhythmic pace comparable to Minor Threat and D.R.I. Stewart also introduced the band to the staff of the Maximum RocknRoll magazine where David Hayes entered the picture. Hudgens used the magazine as a resource to communicate with people all over the world via mail. External influences other than hardcore punk began to appear and the band started experiencing with these influences. David Hayes then released Plaid Retina on Lookout! Records, the Berkeley based label he formed with Larry Livermore. Since the album was already recorded, releasing it was done fast and efficiently. The East Bay and San Francisco Bay Area then become an additional focal point for the band. Morris got a van for the band, so national touring outside of California could begin. =Boxcar= At some point, Rob Anderson quit to become a Marine, and Travis from the \\"Oblivion\\" days joined on bass. Boxcar was recorded again with Gray Gregson at A.I.R. and was a cassette tape demo that consisted of covers on side A, and originals on side B. A sort of introduction of Travis to the world. Thru the mail, Hudgens crossed paths with Musical Tragedies, a record label in Germany that later released Boxcar as a 7\\" EP. Once again, since the material was already recorded, this project was able to be pressed and released very efficiently. The originals on side B had a noticeable tempo relax from the first Plaid Retina release. However, the external influences other than hardcore have yet to show themselves - that will happen with the next release, Pinkeye. The band spent a lot of personal time exploring these influences and getting them ready before presenting a radical change in their sound. After the release of Boxcar, the band began touring around the United States. =Pinkeye= Before the new album's release, the band debuted much of the new material in outside stage matin√©e performances at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, to stunned audiences. The music featured dramatic twists, tempo changes, stops and starts that seemed ironically rhythmic. The music still felt at home in the punk shows, because it has retained its brashness (and in some tracks, high speed tempos) in spite of the original approaches. Pinkeye, the band's first full length 12\\" album, was released via Lookout! Records in 1989, and was recorded at A.I.R. by Gray Gregson. A friend of the band, Tony Sevener, loaned Hudgens a wide array of cymbals that helped the drum sound stretch out a little, along with some experimental drum effects by Gray. The new material was also performed on local Public-access television cable TV show, \\"The Shout Club\\". Visalia pro skater Tom Knox met the band and most of Pinkeye appeared on Santa Cruz Skateboards' Strange Notes No. 3\\\\. =Rejection= Tim Biskup presented two different pressings of Rejection on Duck Butter Records, one of the pressings having hand screened art and clear red vinyl. The Rejection era was an enthusiastic period, because the Rejection EP was recorded and released in Fresno. Ironically enough, the band got popular across the country first before they did locally due to the albums and touring, using the Berkeley/East Bay area as a springboard. Even though the band had roots in Fresno, they only really knew a handful of people, mostly from the Capitol Punishment camp (due to the distance from Visalia) and this release brought them more inside the scene. Tim opened different doors and they met many new friends. Many more live performances in different venues in the city started happening. The local scene received the majority of the hand- screened versions. The evolution of the music continued, some of the more conventional approaches still on Pinkeye (even though that album was very original) can be heard melting away. Travis acquired an Ibanez left-handed bass guitar and also came across an Ampeg combo bass amplifier which would later define his sound on the albums and tours to come. Matt started experimenting with Yamaha SBG Model guitars. \\"I sat on a milk crate that Matt got for me to play drums from the beginning all the way to Rejection. We also used it to haul the stands and the pedal. If I broke one I just went to the back of a grocery store and got another one. I played a nice Yamaha kit I got before Pinkeye but couldn't make the payments and had to go back to pieced together pieces of crap.\\" -Don said. =Mind Tracing the Going Down= David Hayes presented Mind Tracing the Going Down, Plaid Retina's second full-length album, in 1991 on Very Small Records. The album was recorded by Billy Anderson at the Razor's Edge in San Francisco. If Rejection was a local breakthrough, Mind Tracing did the same for the band in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many more Bay Area gigs were to follow in venues not just in the East Bay, along with significant new friendships forged with bands such as Schlong, False Sacrament, Neurosis and Victim's Family. Brad Weaver joined the band. Around this time, Matt Morris put together certain pieces of equipment that helped define his sound: a Mesa/Boogie amplifier (from the factory, purchased around the time of recording the album) in conjunction with a Roland JC-120 amplifier, a Paul Reed Smith guitar, and a complex, well defined system of delay and other effects. Going Down CD, 1991 Shmin Esso / Duck Butter SE / DB021 --> Not long after its release, Matt teamed up with Tim Biskup to release Mind Tracing on the dual Shmin Esso / Duck Butter conglomerate, Shmin Esso being Matt's label. =The Spark.= The Spark. was an EP released on Very Small Records and recorded at Sergay's Recording Emporium in the San Francisco Bay Area. At that time, Hudgens got a Tama drum kit. =Dead End Mind= Third full-length album on Very Small Records, recorded at House of Faith, Northern California. First to be released on compact disc. =What I Can't Have= EP on Joey Edwards' Little Deputy Records. Recorded by Scott Greenall in Garden Grove California, before the band moved to Austin, Texas. While still in California, Don acquired a Gretsch drum kit (which will define his sound through the remaining years). In Austin, Mark Hughes joined on keyboards and Travis switched equipment from his Ampeg to a new Trace Elliot rig . =Unreleased album= The band recorded in Memphis an unreleased album. However, the song \\"Sperm\\" made it out as a single for a heavy metal compilation. =Breakup= The band broke up in 1996 in Austin, Texas. Discography * Plaid Retina - Lookout!

He was an eleventh-generation descendant of King Naemul, and the Daughter of haechan Kim Hyo-bang by King Seongdeok's daughter Lady Saso. He married Lady Gujok, the daughter of gakgan Kim Yang-pum. Seondeok served under King Hyegong in the position of sangdaedeung. In 780, ichan Kim ji-Jeong, led a rebellion against King Hyegong. The King ordered the then Sangdaedeung Kim Yang-Sang(later, King Seondeok) to fight off the rebels. However, the rebel forces succeeded in storming the palace and killed King Hyegong and his Queen. Kim Yang-san was then proclaimed as Silla's new ruler. Some historians believed that King Seondeok may have killed King Hyegong himself, since he was the one who benefited the most from his death. After his death in 785, Seondeok was cremated and his ashes scattered on the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Seondeok's successor was King Wonseong.

Parliamentary supervision Parliamentary supervision over the intelligence community is undertaken by the Subcommittee for Intelligence and Secret Services, a subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, which supervises the entire Israeli Security Forces. Structure and organization The issue regarding the suitable structure of the IIC, and questions as to dividing responsibilities and jurisdictions between Aman, Shabak, and Mossad, as well as the format of work for the three in relation to Prime Ministers and Ministers, all of these became agenda issues many times in the past. Various commissions and individual inspectors were appointed throughout the years, whether due to traumatic experiences or as a matter of routine, in order to examine the issues and propose recommendations. These were: *The Yadin-Sherf Commission (1963) *The Agranat Commission (1973‚Äì74) *The Zamir Commission (1974) *The Commissions of Aluf Aharon Yariv (1984, 1986) *The Commission to investigate the intelligence network following the War in Iraq (2004) The government was tasked with the matter on a number of occasions and arrived at various decisions. The State Comptroller made the issue his agenda and submitted to the Knesset his findings and conclusions. In 1994, the Subcommittee for Intelligence also examined the questions and brought its recommendations before the Prime Minister. The division of labour among the intelligence arms, Aman, Shabak, and Mossad, in the current structure of the IIC, is usually established upon a geographical basis. There are interfacing and overlapping segments, often rather wide, among the organizations. The level of coordination and inter- regional cooperation has suffered in the past from fundamental shortcomings, which has hindered the effectiveness of intelligence work on several fronts. The organizations repressed the necessity for the mutual sharing of intelligence information and in synchronizing some activities. There are still open-ended issues remaining to be discussed, including disputed ones, as to the division of jurisdictions and inter-regional sectoral boundaries. In a document known as the \\"Magna Carta,\\" the heads of the three services continue their attempt to arrive at agreements regarding these. The Intelligence Subcommittee follows this discourse and examines the steps required to practically settle key areas of dispute. If needed, the Subcommittee could become actively involved in the matter so as to ensure appropriate and reasonable standards for overall intelligence work in Israel. Role of Aman The historical development of the IIC destined Aman with a range of activities and tasks that are conventionally outside the realm of military intelligence in the West, such as the responsibility for intelligence research in political matters and other markedly non-military affairs. This largely followed from the reliance by the State of Israel during its first years on the IDF as an anchor and mechanism to fulfill national tasks, it being a system with organizational capacities, resources, and available human resources. As such, Aman has assumed functions which ordinarily would be handled by other intelligence agencies. Accordingly, some critics say, there is a need to reexamine the position and placement assumed by intelligence bodies within the current structure, and transferring certain strategic and political areas and non-military ones, from Aman to a civilian intelligence authority. Reforms The Commission to investigate the intelligence network following the War in Iraq maintained that, notwithstanding the historical consolidation behind the current IIC structure, and despite the advantages gained by Aman's Research Department and Unit 8200 during many years of service, it is finally time to restructure the IIC in accordance with a proper work distribution, professional designation, as well as a correct constitutional and legal frame of reference. The Commission recommended on reforming the current IIC structure, ending up with three or four independent intelligence services, alongside the National Security Council, with the distinction between them being based upon the respective spheres of responsibility of each service: *Aman (IDF): its jurisdiction is to consist primarily of \\"military intelligence\\"‚Äîalerting the political leadership and the security arms to the possibility of war and estimating the means of the enemy, and identifying prospective targets during a war or a limited military conflict. *Mossad: is to be charged with, in addition to foiling attacks, a strategic-political emphasis, which includes evaluating the stability of regimes, and engaging in industrial-scientific-technological and nuclear-related intelligence as well as against global terrorism. *Shabak: is to be tasked with the security of the State, its citizens, and organs, against Palestinian and other forms of terrorism, and against internal subversion. *National Security Council: is to evaluate global conditions according to overall intelligence, and preparing national and security responses. *SIGINT service: this proposed service would supply all the other services with SIGINT intelligence.

The son carried out what his father had started but still he didn't have any success. Later, a monk dreamed that if a child was cast into the metal, the bell would ring. The monk then took a child from the village and had her cast into the metal. When the bell was complete, the bell made the most beautiful sound when struck. Some, however, believe the legend may actually be a modern invention, and that the story and name originated in the 1920s. A story that was published about the \\"Eomilne bell\\" or \\"Earmilne bell\\" (Ïñ¥Î∞ÄÎÑ§ Ï¢Ö) may have been distorted in retelling.http://cha.korea.kr/gonews/branch.do?act=detailView&type;=news&sectionId;=co_sec_1&categoryId;=&dataId;=155312736 (Korean), also fiction section of the 'Îß§ÏùºÏã†Î≥¥(Official newspaper of the Governor-General of Korea, published by the Japanese colonial government).

In each series, Parry visits a number of remote tribes in such locales as the Himalayas, Ethiopia, West Papua, Gabon, and Mongolia, spending a month living and interacting with each society. While there, Parry adopts the methods and practices of his hosts, participating in their rituals and exploring their cultural norms. This often enables him to form personal bonds with the members of each tribe. Parry tries to learn the basics of the tribe's language but is also accompanied by a translator. The series is co-produced by BBC Wales and the Discovery Channel. A second series aired in July 2006 and the third began on 21 August 2007 on BBC Two, and ended on 25 September 2007. No further series have been made, though Parry's 2008 series, Amazon has a similar synopsis. Parry was awarded the BAFTA Cymru \\"Best On-Screen Presenter\\" award in 2008 for his work on the 'Penan' Episode.

Titled Citadel during development, it is one of a few games designed to use the enhanced graphics of the Super FX powered GSU-1. Gameplay The player pilots an experimental mech called the Morphing Battle System against the five worlds of the Aki-Do Forces. The player enters the Vortex, to save the Deoberon system, retrieving the core from the fierce forces, the Aki-Do. The MBS can transform between four different modes, The Walker, Sonic Jet, Land Burner, and Hard Shell. This fueled unconfirmed speculation that the concept may have been derived from an unreleased game based on Transformers: Generation 2. However, in a 2015 interview with Retro Gamer, programmer Michael Wong-Powell confirmed that Vortex and Transformers were entirely separate projects, with the latter being cancelled during development.  Release  In March 1994, Argonaut Software was signed as a third-party developer by Atari Corporation to develop games for the Atari Jaguar platform. A port of Vortex for the Jaguar was announced at Spring ECTS '94, but it ultimately was never released. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game at 6 out of 10. They remarked that the pace is slow, but complimented the unique concept and high challenge. GameFans three reviewers scored it 79%, 72%, and 70%.GameFan, volume 2, issue 11, page 31 The game was criticized for its difficulty and its lag, which was common for Super FX games of its type.

The Golden Stool (Ashanti-; full title, Sika Dwa Kofi \\"the Golden Stool born on a Friday\\") is the royal and divine throne of kings of the Ashanti people and the ultimate symbol of power in Asante. According to legend, Okomfo Anokye, High Priest and one of the two chief founders of the Asante Confederacy, caused the stool to descend from the sky and land on the lap of the first Asante king, Osei Tutu. Such seats were traditionally symbolic of a chieftain's leadership, but the Golden Stool is believed to house the spirit of the Asante nation‚Äîliving, dead and yet to be dead Symbology and ritual Each stool is understood to be the seat of the owner's soul and when not in use it is placed against a wall so that other souls passing by may relax on it. The Golden Stool is the royal throne and must never touch the ground; instead it is placed on a blanket. During inauguration, a new king is raised and lowered over the stool without touching it. The Golden Stool is carried to the king on a pillow, as only the Asantehene himself is allowed to handle it. During solemn occasions, the Golden Stool is placed on the king's left on a throne of its own, the hwedom dwa (Ashanti, throne facing the crowd). Historical conflict Many wars have broken out over the ownership of the royal throne. In 1896, Asantehene Prempeh I was deported rather than risk losing both the war and the throne. In 1900, Sir Frederick Hodgson, the Governor of the Gold Coast, demanded to be allowed to sit on the Golden Stool, and ordered that a search for it be conducted. This provoked an armed rebellion known as the War of the Golden Stool, which resulted in the annexation of Ashanti to the British Empire, but preserved the sanctity of the Golden Stool. In 1921, African road workers discovered the stool and stripped some of the gold ornaments. They were taken into protective custody by the British, before being tried according to local custom and sentenced to death. The British intervened and the group was instead banished. An assurance of non-interference with the stool was then given by the British and it was brought out of hiding. In 1935 the stool was used in the ceremony to crown Osei Tutu Agyeman Prempeh II. Appearance and craftsmanship An Akan stool believed to be for a Queen mother, 1940‚Äì1965, in the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis The Golden Stool is a curved seat 46 cm high with a platform 61 cm wide and 30 cm deep. Its entire surface is inlaid with gold, and hung with bells to warn the king of impending danger. It has not been seen by many and only the king, queen, true prince Ofosu Sefa Boakye, and trusted advisers know the hiding place. Replicas have been produced for the chiefs and at their funerals are ceremonially blackened with animal blood, a symbol of their power for generations. The stool is one of the main focal points of the Asante today because it still shows succession and power. Each stool is made from a single block of the wood of Alstonia boonei (a tall forest tree with numinous associations) and carved with a crescent-shaped seat, flat base and complex support structure. The many designs and symbolic meanings mean that every stool is unique; each has a different meaning for the person whose soul it seats. Some designs contain animal shapes or images that recall the person who used it. The general shape of Asante stools has been copied by other cultures and sold worldwide. If the Golden Stool was ever to be destroyed or captured by the enemies of the Asante Kingdom of Ghana, the whole kingdom would descend into chaos. The Statement above is said to be the warning given by Okomfo Anokye, the priest or traditional healer of the Ashanti empire who is revered as the greatest and wisest sage of the Asante people and would cofound the Asante empire.

Immigration Voice works to remove these and other regulations by supporting changes to immigration law for high-skilled legal employment-based Indian immigrants.  History  Immigration Voice is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization that helps Indian immigrants, legislative and executive branches of government solving problems in the employment with the green card process due to delays, USCIS processing and Labor Certification. Immigration Voice's purpose is to improve immigration laws and employment where Indian immigrants can enter into the Unites States economy easier and faster. Immigration Voice is known as a national organization of legal, high-skilled Indian immigrants living in the United States. The organization has almost 100,000 Indian members all around the country and represents the interests of the nearly one million Indian immigrants and their family members stuck in green card backlogs.  Goals and accomplishments  On March 3 and March 4, 2014, Immigration Voice members held over 300 meetings with lawmakers and congressional staff over two days. Participants will advocate for action on immigration this year and a greater focus on stopping the green card backlogs which will confront employment-based immigrants. Immigration Voice's primary goal is to reduce delays with green cards for Indian immigrants in order to work legally within the United States. Usually the green card system takes about 12 years before an Indian national may be granted permanent residence. One of the biggest accomplishments for Immigration Voice is being involved in the movement of the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was first suggested in 2001 and has recently been reintroduced in the United States Senate. The Act would allow conditional residency to students who are illegal aliens, arrived in the U.S. as minors, graduated from U.S. high schools and lived in the country for five or more years, prior to the bill's enactment. California has embraced a version of the DREAM Act that would allow illegal alien children living in the United States to be given private college scholarships to state schools. On May 8, 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced proposed regulations that will allow dependent spouses of certain principal workers to be able to request employment authorization. The current rules are stopping thousands of immigrant spouses living legally in the United States from working while waiting on their permanent residency. The extreme backlogs are making families from certain countries struggle, most notably India; current rules cause financial stress over many years and denying the U.S. economy of the talents of these high-skilled future Americans.  Criticism  Immigration Voice has been countered by several think tanks like the Center for Immigration Studies on their policy proposals which they argue have caused wage depression for US workers and jeopardized the diversity of immigrants into the US. Several incidents of discrimination against US technology workers and ethnic nepotism have been documented resulting in ongoing litigation. https://cis.org/Report/Untold-Stories-American-Workers-Replaced-H1B-Visa- Program  References   External links  *The New York Times: The Other Immigration *BusinessWeek: How Skilled Immigrants Found a Voice *The New York Times: US Agency Is Swamped by Requests for Visas *The Washington Post: A Gift From Gandhi *BusinessWeek: Skilled Immigrants' March on Washington *BBC News: Skilled immigrants suffer US limbo Non-profit organizations based in the United States Immigration to the United States 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations ","title":"Immigration Voice"},{"id":"4990850","text":"The Sandy River and its tributary the Little Sandy River are short rivers in north-central South Carolina in the United States.

The term was probably introduced in 1980 by Bartell, Dereniak, and Wolfe. Most often it is used to name the general mathematical function which describes the way in which the light is scattered by a surface. However, in practice, this phenomenon is usually split into the reflected and transmitted components, which are then treated separately as BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) and BTDF (bidirectional transmittance distribution function). BSDF: BRDF + BTDF * BSDF is a superset and the generalization of the BRDF and BTDF. The concept behind all BxDF functions could be described as a black box with the inputs being any two angles, one for incoming (incident) ray and the second one for the outgoing (reflected or transmitted) ray at a given point of the surface. The output of this black box is the value defining the ratio between the incoming and the outgoing light energy for the given couple of angles. The content of the black box may be a mathematical formula which more or less accurately tries to model and approximate the actual surface behavior or an algorithm which produces the output based on discrete samples of measured data. This implies that the function is 4(+1)-dimensional (4 values for 2 3D angles + 1 optional for wavelength of the light), which means that it cannot be simply represented by 2D and not even by a 3D graph. Each 2D or 3D graph, sometimes seen in the literature, shows only a slice of the function. * Some tend to use the term BSDF simply as a category name covering the whole family of BxDF functions. * The term BSDF is sometimes used in a slightly different context, for the function describing the amount of the scatter (not scattered light), simply as a function of the incident light angle. An example to illustrate this context: for perfectly lambertian surface the BSDF (angle)=const. This approach is used for instance to verify the output quality by the manufacturers of the glossy surfaces. * Another recent usage of the term BSDF can be seen in some 3D packages, when vendors use it as a 'smart' category to encompass the simple well known cg algorithms like Phong, Blinn‚ÄìPhong etc. * Acquisition of the BSDF over the human face in 2000 by Debevec et al. was one of the last key breakthroughs on the way to fully virtual cinematography with its ultra- photorealistic digital look-alikes. The team was the first in the world to isolate the subsurface scattering component (a specialized case of BTDF) using the simplest light stage, consisting on moveable light source, moveable high- res digital camera, 2 polarizers in a few positions and really simple algorithms on a modest computer. The team utilized the existing scientific knowledge that light that is reflected and scattered from the air-to-oil layer retains its polarization while light that travels within the skin loses its polarization. The subsurface scattering component can be simulated as a steady high-scatter glow of light from within the models, without which the skin does not look realistic. ESC Entertainment, a company set up by Warner Brothers Pictures specially to do the visual effects / virtual cinematography system for The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions isolated the parameters for an approximate analytical BRDF which consisted of lambertian diffusion component and a modified specular Phong component with a Fresnel type of effect. Overview of the BxDF functions BRDF vs. BSSRDF *BDF (Bidirectional distribution function) is collectively defined by BRDF and BTDF. *BSSRDF (Bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function or Bidirectional surface scattering RDF) describes the relation between outgoing radiance and the incident flux, including the phenomena like subsurface scattering (SSS). The BSSRDF describes how light is transported between any two rays that hit a surface. *BRDF (Bidirectional reflectance distribution function) is a simplified BSSRDF, assuming that light enters and leaves at the same point (see the image on the right). * BTDF (Bidirectional transmittance distribution function) is similar to BRDF but for the opposite side of the surface. (see the top image). * BSSTDF (Bidirectional scattering-surface transmittance distribution function) is like BTDF but with subsurface scattering. * BSSDF (Bidirectional scattering-surface distribution function) is collectively defined by BSSTDF and BSSRDF.

Fort Worth, TX: Split Rock Press. =The Original Version= The current version of The Worth Ranch Grace is slightly different from the original version: Note that the first two lines are different from either the contemporary version or the \\"Wilderness\\" version. This original version is copied here verbatim from a handwritten copy of The Worth Ranch Grace written on a small piece of note paper by James P. Fitch, Region Nine Scout Executive, during a trip to Worth Ranch in the 1930s. Fitch was later General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch and Phillips Properties of the Boy Scouts of America. At the top of the paper, also written in Fitch's handwriting, is the title \\"The Worth Ranch Grace.\\" Fitch kept this filed away in his copy of the small book \\"Songs Scouts Sing,\\" (Sept. 1935 printing). This is probably the earliest surviving written copy of \\"The Worth Ranch Grace.\\"This book and the handwritten copy of the original version of The Worth Ranch Grace are in the possession of Pete Normand of College Station, Texas. Normand is the son-in-law of Fitch's only son, William D. Fitch. =James P. Fitch= James P. Fitch was Region Scout Executive for Region Nine (Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico) from 1920 to 1945 when he became General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch, Cimarron, New Mexico, and Phillips Properties for the B.S.A. Fitch was the man who encouraged Waite Phillips generosity to Region Nine throughout the 1930s, and accepted the gift of Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp in 1938, and later the larger gift of land in December 1941 that became Philmont Scout Ranch. If it were not for Jim Fitch's interest in recording The Worth Ranch Grace as it was used in the 1930s, we would not have this earliest version.Murphy, Lawrence R. (1972). Philmont: A History of New Mexico's Cimarron Country. Albuquerque, NM: Univ. of New Mexico Press. =Minor Huffman= The origin of The Worth Ranch Grace was corroborated by Minor S. Huffman, Sr., the first General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch in his book High Adventure Among the Magic Mountains: Philmont, the First 50 Years. In that book, Huffman wrote, \\"Worth Ranch was definitely the earliest camp to use the Grace.\\" Huffman recalls hearing The Worth Ranch Grace on a visit to Worth Ranch in 1930 with Dr. James E. West (Scouting), Chief Scout Executive from 1911 to 1943; James P. Fitch, Region Scout Executive; and Frank Wozencraft, Region Chairman of Region Nine. (This may have been the visit by Fitch when he made his handwritten copy of \\"The Worth Ranch Grace.\\") This visit in 1930 was the occasion of the official dedication of Worth Ranch, although the Ranch had been in operation for over a year. That dedication ceremony is recorded on film, and may be the only visit to the Ranch by the renowned Dr. West. =Faust Nobles= In his book, Huffman recalled that at the time of their 1930 visit to Worth Ranch they thought The Worth Ranch Grace was written by Faust Nobles, a member of the Worth Ranch Camp Staff during its first decade, and a Field Scout Executive of the Council. Nobles was well known for his talent at writing verse, both in poetry and in song. But in the Spring of 1980, prior to the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Worth Ranch, Nobles denied writing The Worth Ranch Grace and identified Jerry Fulkerson as its author.Normand, Pete (1980). Interview with Faust Nobles in connection with research for the book \\"Palo Pinto Campfires,\\" publ. 1980, Fort Worth, TX: Split Rock Press. Nobles also served as head Scout Executive of the Cimarron Valley Council. Nobles also wrote \\"The Worth Ranch Song,\\" and, in 1947, wrote a poem titled \\"Novitiate\\" about Philmont Scout Ranch. =Clarence Dunn= Another piece in the puzzle was filled in by Minor Huffman when he confirmed that The Worth Ranch Grace was brought to Philmont in the Summer of 1943 by Clarence E. Dunn, a Worth Ranch Scouter and a Scoutmaster from the Fort Worth Area Council. Dunn, a school teacher, became a member of the Philmont Staff in the summer of 1945 with the position of Personnel Director. Dunn developed the Ranger Program and held the position of Chief Ranger for 26 years until his retirement at the end of the 1970 season. If it were not for Clarence Dunn, The Worth Ranch Grace would have never been introduced to thousands of Philmont Scouts from every part of the world over the past decades. Dunn was later honored by having an elementary school in Arlington, Texas, named for him. =Epilogue= Because of its continued use at Philmont Scout Ranch since the 1940s, The Worth Ranch Grace has been carried home to every corner of the U.S. where it has become widely known by two different names: \\"The Wilderness Grace\\" and \\"The Philmont Grace.\\" =Northern Tier Wilderness Grace= The Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, have modified and added to the Wilderness Grace for use in its canoeing programs: Northern Tier staff claim the Grace originated with them 90 years ago and that Philmont adopted and adapted by dropping the third line, as there's little water and no portage trails in New Mexico. =The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve= The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve has also modified the Wilderness Grace for use in its high adventure/Jamboree programs: See also *Scout prayer References The history of the Worth Ranch Grace is also covered in a book by Maurice G.

Lockhart, William J. Duiker The A to Z of Vietnam, 2010, p.364 entryHe published seven collections of poems, the first of which was the 1946 collection entitled T·ª´ ·∫•y (Thenceforth), which included many of his most popular and influential works that were written between 1937 and 1946.Nguyen C√¥ng C√¥ng Luan Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars: Memoirs of a Victim Turned Soldier 2012 \\"The poem was widely circulated in Vi·ªát Minh publications, but it was withdrawn at the start of the Khrushchev era.

The poem was so servile that ...\\" Following the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he became a prominent figure in the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam. Biography T·ªë H·ªØu, whose real name is Nguy·ªÖn Kim Th√†nh, was born October 4, 1920 in Hoi An, Quang Nam province, as the youngest son of the family. At the age of 9, he and his father returned home and lived in Phu Lai village, now in Quang Tho commune, Quang Dien district, Thua Thien province. His father was a poor scholar, could not earn a living and struggled to earn a living, but he liked poetry, liked collecting proverbs and folk songs. He taught To Huu to write old poems. His mother was also the daughter of a scholar, knew many folk songs of Hue and loved him very much. His parents helped to nourish the soul of To Huu poetry. In 1938 he met a teacher, who had given him the pseudonym \\"T·ªë H·ªØu\\", taken from ƒê·ªó Th·ªã's sentence which means \\"big willpower available in my son\\". T·ªë H·ªØu accepted this name but interpreted it as a \\"pure friend\\". His mother died when he was 12 years old. At the age of 13, he entered Hue National University. Here he was directly exposed to the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Gorky, ... and approached through books, combined with the mobilization of members of the Communist Party of Vietnam (Le Duan, Phan Dang Luu, Nguyen Chi Dieu) soon communist ideals. In 1936 he joined the Indochina Democratic Youth Union. In 1938 he was admitted to the Indochina Communist Party. In April 1939, he was arrested, tortured and exiled to Thua Phu Prison (Hue) and transferred to Lao Bao Prison (Quang Tri) and many other prisons in the Central Highlands. In March 1942, he escaped from the prison ƒê·∫Øc Gl√™i (now in Kon Tum), went to Thanh H√≥a and contacted the party (through his secret activities in the district H·∫≠u L·ªôc, Thanh Hoa province). In 1945, when the August Revolution broke out, he was elected Chairman of the Rebellion Committee of Thua Thien-Hue. T·ªë H·ªØu moved quickly and successfully through what became the Communist Party of Vietnam. During the pre-unification period (before 1975) T·ªë H·ªØu was most influential in setting cultural policy in North Vietnam, especially in deciding the bounds of what was permissible for intellectuals and artists to publish and perform during this tightly controlled period. His control of intellectual and artistic production was matched only by Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh himself.Patricia M. Pelley - Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past 2002 - Page 120 \\"When T·ªë H·ªØu received the poetry prize for Viet Bac, he was an alternate member of the Central Committee.13 \\"Thu-H∆∞∆°ng Nguy·ªÖn-V√µ The Ironies of Freedom: Sex, Culture, and Neoliberal Governance in ...- 2008 - Page 191 \\"Tu·∫•n Ng·ªçc Nguy·ªÖn emphasizes partiinost, or party-minded spirit (ƒë·∫£ng t√≠nh), as the determining criterion of socialist realism.20 He cites numerous poets such as T·ªë H·ªØu, Xu√¢n Di·ªáu, and Ch·∫ø Lan Vi√™n and some prose writers such as Nguy·ªÖn ... Intellectual discontent with this control was expressed by the poet L√™ ƒê·∫°t who, during the Nh√¢n VƒÉn affair, declared that T·ªë H·ªØu considered writers and artists petty bourgeois elements, and regarded literature as a mere tool of politics. As an example, he mentioned the case of Nam Cao whom T·ªë H·ªØu compelled to write a work on the rural taxation system, a topic with which the writer was by no means familiar.Bal√°zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955-56.

As the leader of the cultural section, he was named as the chief instigator of the persecution of intellectuals during the Nh√¢n VƒÉn affair. However, according to the musician VƒÉn Cao, one of the prominent victims, the main author of this policy was Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh, the general secretary of the communist party at that time. According to VƒÉn Cao, T·ªë H·ªØu, as a poet, was not sufficiently hard-hearted to pursue such a policy on his own.

T·ªë H·ªØu enjoyed a steep rise in the party and government culminating in an equally steep and precipitous decline. He was blamed for the disastrous 1985 attempt at monetary reform and the ruinous inflation that resulted from its unsuccessful implementation. Inflation had risen 700% by 1986. T·ªë H·ªØu had to step down from his position as deputy prime minister and played no further political role in Vietnam. Despite his political fall from grace, T·ªë H·ªØu remained the Communist Party's poet-laureate. He died in 2002.

Career Born in Dallas, Texas, Gary Myrick played guitar and sang in Dallas and neighboring Fort Worth starting as a teenager. Eventually, he built a significant enough reputation to be asked to join Austin, Texas band Krackerjack, replacing Stevie Ray Vaughan who had left to begin his solo career. After relocating to Los Angeles, California, he formed Gary Myrick & the Figures, releasing a self-titled album in 1980 which included the hit \\"She Talks in Stereo\\", which peaked at number 56 in Australia. The band then released the LP Living in a Movie (1981), followed by the EP Language (1983), which featured the percussive single \\"Guitar, Talk, Love & Drums\\" and an MTV hit \\"Message is You\\". His combination of blues, rock and new wave won him airplay on modern rock radio stations in the United States and exposure on MTV throughout the 1980s. Two of his songs, \\"She Talks in Stereo\\" and \\"Time to Win\\", were used in the 1983 film Valley Girl. Myrick took a break from his solo work to write four songs and play guitar on John Waite's No Brakes album, which included Waite's biggest solo hit \\"Missing You\\" and reached the top spot on the Billboard album chart in 1984. The following year came Myrick's LP Stand for Love with the single \\"When Angels Kiss\\" and a re-recording of \\"She Talks in Stereo.\\" For the next few years, Myrick concentrated on work as a session and touring guitarist before joining his next group. Paul Simonon (former bassist of The Clash), Nigel Dixon (former lead singer of Whirlwind) and Myrick united to form Havana 3 am. The band released a self-titled album in 1991, melding rockabilly, Latin and punk traditions. After Simonon left the band, Myrick began work on the next Havana 3 am album with Dixon. Dixon, however died of cancer in 1993. Myrick rebuilt Havana 3 am and completed the Texas Glitter and Tombstone Tales album in 1996 with Tom Felicetta and Jamie Chez. Moving towards roots rock, Myrick switched to a stripped down, acoustic approach for his 2001 solo release, Waltz of the Scarecrow King. Reinvent the Gods, featuring a cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"As Tears Go By,\\" was self-released in 2004. Myrick continues to play solo but also performs as a session and touring guitarist. He has worked with Big Audio Dynamite, Jackson Browne, The Eagles, Steve Jones (former guitarist of the Sex Pistols), Wilson Pickett, Queen Ida, Bonnie Raitt, Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson, Stevie Wonder and others. He has also done some work scoring films. Gary Myrick and The Figures reunited in 2010 with their first concert in Hollywood, California at The Roxy on June 22.

Henry (before 1144‚Äì1173√ó77), born Rodrigo, was a son of the Navarrese king Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez and his wife, Margaret of L'Aigle, and brother of the Sicilian queen dowager Margaret, who made him Count of Montescaglioso (1166) and then Count of the Principate (1168). Arrival in Sicily (1166) The chief primary source for Henry's life is the Sicilian court chronicler known as Hugo Falcandus.His chronicle, History of the Tyrants of Sicily, is available in its original Latin at The Latin Library. Henry is also mentioned in the chronicle of Romuald Guarna. Both historians are contemporaries. He is an extremely unfriendly source to Henry. He reports the rumour that Henry was never acknowledged as a son by the Navarrese king and was considered a bastard, the product of one the queen's affairs.Hans Houben, \\"Enrico di Navarra\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani. This is contradicted by the actions of his sister, who always treated him as a full brother of royal blood.John Julius Norwich, The Kingdom in the Sun, 1130‚Äì1194 (London: Longmans, 1970). Henry's birth name, also, is evidence of legitimacy, for he was probably named after King Garc√≠a's illustrious grandfather, Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, known as El Cid.G. A. Loud and Thomas E. J. Wiedemann, edd., The History of the Tyrants of Sicily by ‚ÄòHugo Falcandus‚Äô, 1154‚Äì69 (Manchester University Press, 1998), pp. 155‚Äì56. Falcandus sums up Henry's appearance (short and swarthy) and character thus: > This Henry was low in stature, had a thin beard and a disagreeably dark > complexion. He was rash and maladroit in conversation, a man interested only > by dice and gambling, and he had no other desire than to have a playmate and > money to lose.Quotation translated from the Italian of Houben, \\"Enrico di > Navarra\\": > >> Questo Enrico era di statura bassa, aveva una barba molto rada e una ciera spiacevolmente scura. Era avventato e maldestro nella conversazione, uomo cui interessava solo il giuoco dei dadi e d'azzardo, e che non aveva altro desiderio se non di avere un compagno di giuoco e molto denaro da perdere. Upon his arrival in Sicily Margaret made him change his name from Rodrigo (Latin Rodericus), which sounded strange to the local nobility, to the more palatable Henry (Latin Henricus). Henry arrived in the kingdom of Sicily between May and September 1166. His sister had been, since the death of her husband, William I of Sicily, regent in the name of her young son, William II. In May or a short time after, perhaps before his arrival, he was married to an illegitimate daughter of Roger II and thus his sister's sister-in-law.Houben, \\"Enrico di Navarra\\"; Norwich, The Kingdom in the Sun, does not believe the marriage, obviously arranged by Margaret, ever took place. On this occasion he was invested with Montescaglioso on the mainland, probably to keep him out of court politics. He was also given the fiefs of Noto, Sclafani and Caltanissetta on the island, territories which had been governed by Geoffrey, the previous Count of Montescaglioso, before his imprisonment for taking part in the rebellion of 1155‚Äì56. Henry first paid a visit to Palermo, the capital and the location of his nephew's court. There \\"he would spend wildly, with neither forethought nor consideration\\" and squander his money, creating such a poor reputation that he was forced to leave for Messina on the opposite end of the island. There too he gambled and fell in with criminals, so that the queen was forced to order him to leave the island and go to Montescaglioso. First revolt and imprisonment (1167‚Äì68) In the summer of 1167, Henry returned to Palermo in order to obtain a part in the government of the whole kingdom. According to Falcandus, he went at the instigation of his friends, who thought that he, as a royal prince, deserved the highest secular office, the chancellorship, then occupied by Richard, Count of Molise. By the summer Stephen du Perche, his and Margaret's cousin, had replaced Richard. Stephen quickly befriended Henry, but some \\"Spanish knights\\" (milites hispanos), Henry's entourage who had travelled with him from Navarre, accused the chancellor of having an affair with the queen. Henry was not so easily persuaded, as Falcandus records: > He responded that he was ignorant of French, which was most necessary at > court, and that his experience was not sufficient; that he should commit to > the government of the chancellor, who was wise and prudent, as well as > noble, despite his affair with the queen.Quotation translated from the > Latin: > >> Quibus ille Francorum se linguam ignorare, que maxime necessaria esset in curia, nec eius esse, respondebat, industrie ut oneri tanto sufficeret; cancellario curam hanc rectissime debere committi, qui discretus esset et prudens summeque nobilis, regi quoque nichilominus ac regine non dubia propinquitate coniunctus. Stephen and Henry appear to have been the leaders, willingly or unwillingly, of two opposed court factions seeking to dominate the regency. Eventually the rumours of incest convinced the count of Montescaglioso to act. He initially accused the chancellor before the king, his nephew, but to no effect. Soon a conspiracy against the detested Stephen had drawn him in. On 15 December 1167, when Stephen had the court moved temporarily to Messina, Henry remained at Palermo to lead the conspirators, whose ranks included Matthew of Ajello, the gaito or judge Richard and Bishop Gentile of Agrigento. When the court returned to Palermo shortly after 12 March 1168, its last session in Messina, Henry demanded, in council, the Principality of Taranto, which had been confiscated from Simon, an illegitimate son of Roger II, and all of Simon's other lands. Then, Gilbert, Count of Gravina, another cousin of Henry and Margaret, rose in council, denounced the count and accused him of treason. The charge was easily established, as Henry had admitted the conspiracy to a judge of Messina a short time before. He was promptly arrested and interned in Reggio di Calabria, while the \\"Spanish knights\\" who had accompanied him were given a day to leave Sicily, which they did. Second revolt (1168) After Henry's imprisonment, Margaret offered him 1,000 gold ducats if he would return to Navarre and promise never to set foot in Sicily again. She assigned a certain French priest, Odo Quarrel, a canon of Chartres Cathedral who had come to Sicily in the following of Stephen du Perche, to escort Henry back to Navarre. He was in Messina, preparing seven galleys for the departure when, on 31 March, Easter Sunday, the Messinans, who despised the chancellor, revolted. Odo was captured and the galleys were commandeered across the strait to Reggio, where Henry was released upon their demand. The citizens rowed him back to Messina as the leader of a second insurrection against his cousin. Henry's brief rule of Messina was marked by bloodshed. He unjailed Odo and handed him over to the people, who executed him. He also failed to prevent a massacre of all the French in the city. He successfully worked to spread the rebellion, which was openly directed against the regime of the chancellor, throughout the island. By the summer Stephen was forced to go into exile. Henry returned triumphant to Palermo with twenty or twenty-four galleys. Richard, the count of Molise, disembarked with him. Historian John Norwich believed that Henry was offered a second sum of money by the queen to return to Navarre, which this time he accepted, but Norwich's assertion that he appears no more in Italian history is false. Rule of the Principate In July 1168 Henry was invested with the Principate and formally made submission in order to obtain it. In a document dated 8 December he is titled \\"by the grace of God and the king Count of the Principate and brother of the Lady Queen Margaret\\".Houben, \\"Enrico di Navarra\\", provides the original Latin: Dei et regis gratia comes Principatus et dominae reginae Margheritae frater. Henry only appears in two more document, one of 1170, the other, his last appearance, of July 1173. He was dead by September 1177, when his widow is cited in a dating clause as regent in the Principate for her son, Henry's heir, William IV. She continued in the regency for almost two decades. Another charter of 1179 also mentions her husband. The first recorded instance of William ruling in his own right dates to April 1195. Notes Further reading *E.

He later served as an economic adviser for postwar economic stabilization programs in Germany and Japan, headed the American delegation to the Austrian Advisory commission, and worked as President Dwight D. Eisenhower's director of the Bureau of the Budget.\\"Dodge, Joseph Morrell.\\" American National Biography 6, (1999): 690-692. Dodge formed economic reconstruction plans for West Germany after World War II, and implemented financial reforms in 1948. He later moved to Japan, having drafted another economic stabilization plan, widely known as the \\"Dodge Line\\", in December 1948, as the financial adviser to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), General Douglas MacArthur.Thorsten, Marie. and Yoneyuki Sugita. \\"Joseph Dodge and the geometry of power in US-Japan relations.\\" Japanese Studies: 1981-2012. Vol. 19. no. 3 (1999):297-314. doi:10. 1080/10371399908727684. Arriving in February 1949 to implement these reforms, Dodge served as a \\"lightning-rod\\" to redirect fiscal criticism away from MacArthur and chose to keep a low profile. Personal life and career Dodge was the first of three children born to Joseph Cheeseman Dodge, a poster artist, and Gertrude Hester Crow. He grew up with his brother and sister on middle-class Kirby Street in Detroit, Michigan. Inspired by the hiking and camping trips his father often took him on, Dodge's earliest ambition was to be a forest ranger. His mother knew better stating, \\"I'm sure Joseph is going to be a banker. He is the only boy of his age who doesn't like to get his hands dirty.\\" \\"World Trade- Man with a Puzzle.\\" Times Magazine, Jan. 24, 1995 After graduating from Detroit Central High School in 1908, Dodge worked at the Standard Accident Insurance Company as a clerk until 1909, when he began work at the Central Savings Bank. He quickly rose through the ranks, starting as a messenger boy, then bookkeeper (while teaching himself accounting), then Michigan's youngest state bank examiner (at age 20). For five years Dodge excelled at his post so well as to attract the attention of Bank Commissioner Edward Doyle, who appointed him as his assistant. In 1916, Dodge married Julia Jane Jeffers and was offered a job by Michigan's banker-Senator James Couzens at the Bank of Detroit as an operating officer. Shortly thereafter, in 1917, Dodge's previous employer Bank Commissioner Doyle asked him to assist his son Tom Doyle in running the nation's largest Dodge auto agency (Joseph Dodge is no kin to the car-making family). During his time as vice president and general manager of the Thomas J. Doyle Company, Dodge took up boxing. On one occasion, Dodge sought out and questioned a spare-parts dealer who had previously spoken scornfully of him. As his secretary recorded in her notebook, \\"The dealer made a wrong move and was suddenly flat on his back.\\" Dodge's boxing coach later remarked, \\"If Mr. Dodge had only stuck to boxing instead of becoming a bank president, he might have made something of himself.\\"\\"World Trade-Budget Observer.\\" Times Magazine, 12-1-1952 As discussed in a 1952 edition of Times Magazine - \\"Budget Observer\\", Dodge's personality could be described as \\"Unbending (he is 'Mr. Dodge' even to the Detroit Bank's vice president), outspoken (he told MacArthur: 'I'm no colonel bucking to be a brigadier-I can be objective, because the most I'll get out of this is a kick in the pants'), indefatigable ('my hobby is work'), Banker Dodge is an implacable anti-inflationist.\\" Great Depression In 1932, Dodge resigned due to the Great Depression, having bluntly stated, \\"Tom, there isn't enough money coming in to keep both of us. I'm leaving.\\" He returned to banking as vice president of the First National Bank, which failed in 1933 with the national banking crisis. Despite this, Dodge helped organize the creation of the National Bank of Detroit and became president of the Detroit Bank in 1933. He remained president of the Detroit Bank until January 1953. Dodge stuck to his ideals and business sense when running his new bank, even when it meant treading on toes here or there. \\"He once turned down a prominent businessman for a small loan when he learned that the man held some stock shares in margin. 'Anyone who buys on margin is a poor financial risk,' said Dodge, thus losing the loan applicants big corporate account.\\" Nevertheless, his tight- shipped business archetype expanded the Detroit Bank's assets by ten times and drew in 380,000 accounts. World War II During World War II, Dodge worked as the director of the headquarters staff division of Army Service Forces in 1941.,Hannan, Caryn. \\"Dodge, Joseph Morrell.\\" Volume 1 of Michigan Biographical Dictionary. Vol. 1. North American Book Dist LLC, 1998: 207 He first began his work for the government acting as price adjuster by monitoring defense contractors to prevent unnecessary government spending through price gougers and profiteers. In 1942, he served in this post first for the Army Air Force Price Adjustment Board for the Central Procurement District in the Midwest. Again in September 1943 Dodge worked shortly for the War Department, renegotiate war contracts. Later that year, Dodge was chairing the \\"Pentagon's topmost War Contracts Board\\", of whom \\"regulated the costs of defense procurement for six federal agencies, including the armed forces.\\" Germany After World War II, Dodge left for Berlin in August 1945 under General Lucius D. Clay as a financial expert and adviser to the U.S. military government in Germany. The first of Dodge's accomplishments in Germany was his reorganization of the banking system, effective in the U.S. occupation zone in 1947. Perhaps his most remarkable improvements was his plans for stabilization of the German currency. Dodge \\"proposed a 90% currency reduction, coupled with capital levies on real property to even out the burden of defeat.\\" Unfortunately, despite his efforts, Dodge's plans were only ever partially implemented in the British, French, and U.S. zones in June 1948, after two years of delay. This was due to disagreement among German occupying powers. These new implementations were meant to discourage hoarding and bartering, consequently stimulating consumption. The reforms had the additional effect of advancing the Soviet's Berlin Blockade, as they considered these new changes were further steps toward amalgamation of western occupation zones into a state matching western ideals. Austria Once the Austrian Peace Treaty was convened upon, an advisory commission was established in order to resolve the disputes over reparation, frontier, and disposition of German assets in Austria. Before the implementation of either the banking or currency reforms in Germany, Dodge's attention was turned to Austrian affairs. President Harry S. Truman assigned Dodge to head the American delegation to the Austrian Advisory commission in May 1947, with a personal rank of Minister. Dodge also found himself serving as deputy of Austrian affairs to the Secretary of State George C. Marshall, at the London meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. In January 1948, he resigned from this post and from 1948 to 1951 \\"Dodge served as a member of the advisory committee on fiscal and monetary problems of the Economic Cooperation Administration, which directed the original Marshall Plan.\\" Financial adviser to MacArthur Perhaps Dodge's most significant and noteworthy accomplishment was that of his work with the economic revitalization of Japan. He first arrived in Japan February 1949, leading a U.S. mission to rehabilitate the Japanese economy, as the financial adviser to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.ÊùâÁî∞Á±≥Ë°å Sugita, Yuneyuki, and Marie Thorston. Beyond The Line: Joseph Dodge and the Geometry of Power in the US-Japan Relations, 1949-1952. Tokyo: University Education Press, 1999. His position, granted by President Truman, carried the personal rank of Minister. Despite his relative success in Germany, prior to this Dodge had declined the role as SCAP financial adviser two times even after a heated meeting with President Truman. He confessed, \\"I see no quick or easy answers. They are inherently missing.\\" The U.S. mission was oriented away from liberal \\"oppression\\", through \\"recognition of the equality of women, new laws supporting labor unions and the right to strike, and educational reforms, among other challenges\\". Japanese foreign exchange earnings were drastically limited by high priced exports, making them uncompetitive in world marketing. The zaibatsu were able to pay off company debts and more easily acquire smaller competing companies, due to the devaluing of the yen through runaway inflation. This also, consequently, priced them out of exportation marketing. From September 1945 to August 1948 prices rose by 700% primarily due to, as Dodge suspected, deliberate policies of postwar Japanese governments.Schonberger, Howard B. Aftermath of War: Americans and the Remaking of Japan, 1945-1952. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1989 The Dodge mission, as a product of American ambitions in Japan, was to alleviate Japan from their rapid inflation rates by imposing a regime of fiscal austerity to balance the Japanese budget, establish a single exchange rate for the yen, and abolish the black market. A month after his arrival in Tokyo, Dodge submitted his revised proposal for economic stabilization. \\"The Dodge Line was cast; it centered on the following four objectives: #balancing the consolidated national budget; #establishing the U.S. Aid Counterpart Fund in place of the lending operations of the RFB; #establishing a single foreign exchange rate; and #decreasing government intervention into the economy, especially through subsidies and price controls.\\" United States Budget Director After President Eisenhower's election in 1952, Dodge was appointed his director of the Bureau of Budget in 1953 with cabinet-level status, the two having met through General Lucius Clay. Dodge attributed his new job as Budget director to \\"being taken by the scruff of the neck and thrown into a basket of snakes.\\" Dodge and Eisenhower shared paralleled priority to curbing inflation by reducing government spending. Prior to the revised budget for fiscal year 1954, that Dodge helped formulate, former president Harry S. Truman had a projected deficit of $10 billion. Dodge was able to reduce this deficit by half during the fifteen months he was in office. Dodge accomplished this by making use of every conceivable revenue, no matter how supposedly insubstantial. For one, he required all government agencies rank proposed programs and cut low-priority spending. Additionally, Dodge rose the rent in Government housing, admissions to national parks, and even told agencies to charge for supplying copies of records. He forbade government agencies and departments from filling vacant positions unless absolutely necessary. Construction work was reduced to only that which was critical. He even refused to replace government cars unless they were six years old and had 60,000 miles of service. Dodge himself never replaced his own official car. \\"This is something you do all the time in business. But the subtractive process had all but disappeared in the government until we restored it.\\" The New Look was the administration department's attempt to balance national defense needs with those of a healthy economy. Dodge, being the first director of budget to also hold a membership in the cabinet and National Security Council, strongly supported the New Look. Ultimately, Dodge successfully removed $12 billion of extraneous government spending. Despite his apparent success, Dodge was unable to meet the balanced budget goals he had aimed for. 70% of government spending was devoted toward national security programs such as the United States Department of Defense, the mutual security pacts, and atomic energy. Similarly, existing legislation claimed another 20% of funds. Finally, the government had to continue paying interest on their national debt, another 8%. The last federal budget Dodge attempted to balance, before his resignation in March 1954, was fiscal 1955, which he was ultimately unable to balance even with a $5 billion reduction in defense spending through the New Look. Regardless, many considered his work a reassertion of control over the federal budget. Final work and resignation Dodge returned as chairman to the Detroit Bank briefly before accepting several presidential delegations to both government committees and advisory boards. Dodge was reviewing long-range American plans for foreign economic aid programs in September 1954 and reappointed as President Eisenhower's special assistant three months later. As such, he was appointed the new cabinet-level position as chairman of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy from 1954 to 1956. In June 1956, Dodge became chairman of the reorganized Detroit Bank and Trust Company who had merged with three local financial institutions and whose assets exceeded $1 billion. Under request of Eisenhower, he served as a member of the Special Committee to Study the Military Assistance Program from 1958 to 1959 as well as a consultant to the National Security Council in 1959. Dodge's final public service was in the Tractors for Freedom Committee, who tried to trade farm equipment as ransom for prisoners from the Bay of Pigs invasion, acting as their treasurer in 1961. Awards Despite never pursuing post-secondary education, Dodge was awarded Honorary Doctorates of Law from Wayne and Michigan Universities. Also, for his accomplishments as financial adviser to the Office of Military Government in Berlin and as General Lucius D. Clay's finance director for American forces in Germany, Dodge was awarded the Medal of Merit on September 18, 1946. Later, he was awarded the Exceptional Civilian Service Medal in 1950, by the Department of the Army, \\"for making possible a stabilization program unparalleled in modern history\\" (more specifically for his economic stabilization plans in Japan). Three years before his death, Dodge was decorated with the Grand Cordon Order of the Rising Sun by Emperor Hirohito on the tenth anniversary of Japan's postwar independence, on April 28, 1962, in recognition of his services.

He was the first African-American man to win a case before the Supreme Court and the first African-American president of YMCA.  Early life  Belford Lawson was born and grew up in Roanoke, Virginia. He attended the University of Michigan and was the school's second African- American varsity football player (having been preceded by George Jewett in the 1890s). He was the only African American on the varsity during Fielding H. Yost's coaching tenure. In 1924, after graduating from Michigan, Lawson was hired as the head football coach and athletic director at Jackson College (now known as Jackson State University), a historically black college in Jackson, Mississippi, the state capital. He also served as a professor of social science and the director of the Teachers' Professional Department. In Lawson's three years as the head football coach at Jackson College, the team compiled a record of 0‚Äì3 and was outscored 54 to 0. Lawson was reported to have held a position as a professor of economics at Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia. The college's president John Lewis, a Yale University graduate, was instrumental in Lawson being accepted to Yale Law School. Lawson completed his degree at Howard University School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1932.  Career  In 1933, Lawson founded the New Negro Alliance (NNA) in Washington, D.C., along with John A. Davis Sr. and M. Franklin Thorne, to challenge white-owned businesses in black neighborhoods that would not hire black employees. The NNA instituted a Don't Buy Where You Can't Work campaign, considered radical at the time, and organized or threatened boycotts against white-owned businesses that did not hire blacks. In response, some businesses arranged for an injunction to stop the picketing. Lawson, the lead attorney, with assistance by Thurgood Marshall, fought back ‚Äì all the way to the United States Supreme Court in New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co. (1938). The court ruled that the organization and residents had a right to boycott. This became a landmark case in the struggle by African Americans against discriminatory hiring practices. Don't Buy Where You Can't Work groups multiplied throughout the nation. The NNA estimated that by 1940, the group had secured 5,106 jobs for blacks because businesses could not afford to lose sales of black customers during the Great Depression. In 1934, Lawson encouraged National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) special counsel Charles Houston to authorize Thurgood Marshall to file the case of Murray v. Maryland (1935) to challenge the state law requiring segregation in the University of Maryland School of Law. Marshall won the case, and Donald Murray was admitted to the university's law school. Lawson was part of the legal team that won Henderson v. Southern Railway Company (1950), challenging the Interstate Commerce Commission's approval of railroad racial segregation practices. The lawsuit resulted in the abolition of segregation in railroad dining cars. Lawson was the 16th General President of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek letter organization established by African Americans. The fraternity sponsors an annual Belford V. Lawson Oratorical Contest. Collegiate members compete in oratorical skills at the chapter level, with the winner competing at the state, regional, and general conventions. The fraternity says \\"the purpose of the Belford V. Lawson Oratorical Contest is to identify problems or special topics of interest within society and determine how the problem or topic relates to the goals and objectives of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated.\\" Lawson rented the third floor of his Logan Circle home to fraternity brother Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a US Representative (D-NY), during Powell's tenure in Congress. In 1973, Lawson was elected President of YMCA of the USA. He continued to be active in law and civic activities but reduced his activities in later years. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1985, after having battled Alzheimer's disease and cancer.

The area has been embroiled in legal trouble over its legitimacy. It is situated south of Saket beyond the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in the southernmost part of the city.  History  The settlement came up in the 1960s a cooperative society for defense staff and their families. However, the area was soon embroiled in controversy and has remained so ever since. The unauthorized residencies in the area have continuously been in a legal quagmire as the Delhi High Court has passed several adverse remarks against the illegal constructions and farm houses in the area, and passed directions to the Delhi Government to take action to tackle the illegal residential constructions. From time to time, several political parties have also taken up the issue of the illegality of the settlement through campaigns as well as assembly debates. The supply of utilities such as water and electricity have been provisionally permitted in the area to curb theft. From time to time, there have been indications that some form of action may be taken against the owners of the illegal farm houses in the area by means of stiff penalties and/ or demolitions. While the general perception is that the area is occupied by affluent and influential personalities, despite many efforts the residents have failed to have the colony regularized, which has been the subject of focus in the mainstream media as well as judicial scrutiny. The area has repeatedly failed to appear on the list of unauthorised settlements which have been legitimised by the Government in view of the ongoing legal issues, while thousands of other unauthorized colonies have been regularized in the meantime. While the Sainik Farms Resident Welfare Association has for long claimed that Sainik Farms is on the verge of becoming legalized, the same has not been the case and there appears to be a cloud of uncertainty on the fate of the residents in the area. The area was not regularized in 2009, when a list of 1,218 illegal colonies in Delhi to be regularized was released. Then, in 2012 once again Sainik Farms missed the list of 1,639 unauthorised colonies which were regularized by the Delhi Development Authority  Schools  * Krishna Maheshwari Sansthan * St. Mary's Public School Near By Places *Saket Metro Station *Saket City *Saket Select City walk Mall *Saket District Centre (Court) References * Farmhouses, boon or bane?

The Shirazi people are notable for helping establish Sunni Islam in Comoros, and the wealth they accumulated from trading commodities and slaves., Quote: \\"The Shirazi were classified as native, that is, Africans, and this they were of low status. Prior to the colonial era, the Shirazi and Arabs saw themselves, for the most part, as one community. (...) Unlike the previous periods in which African captives were usually taken to Persian Gulf areas to work primarily as domestic laborers, by the nineteenth century, most slaves were being utilized on the vast clove and plantations on the East African coast and offshore islands. (...) Arab rule, from this period until its demise at the hands of the European powers, became virtually synonymous with slavery and slave ownership.\\" (...) \\"Though Shirazi ownership of slaves was never as extensive as the Arabs, slaves were a major source of their wealth\\" Genetics in Comoros Msaidie et al. (2010) analyzed the uniparental DNA variation on three Bantu-speaking islands of the Comoros archipelago, collecting blood samples from 577 unrelated Comorian men and women (Grand Comore: 170 men, 67 women; Anjouan: 104 men, 69 women; Moheli: 107 men, 60 women). Oral traditions and historical records indicate that the Comoros islands had a presence of merchants from Shiraz in Iran and that Shirazi princes colonized these islands. Msadie et al. found that the most common paternal haplogroups among the sampled Comorians are E1b1a1-M2 (41%) and E2-M90 (14%). These Y-DNA clades are frequent among other Bantu-speaking populations on the east African mainland, which points to shared origins. The remaining Comorians primarily carry the haplogroups E1b1b-V22, E1b1b-M123, F*(xF2, GHIJK), G2a, I, J1, J2, L1, Q1a3, R1*, R1a*, R1a1 and R2 (29.7%). Of these latter clades, the particular haplotypes that are found in Comoros were observed to be most closely related to those in South Iran. This suggests that these northern lineages were brought by early Shirazi merchants from Persia between 1200-1300 CE, as they established local trading posts on the Comoros islands. Around 6% of the Comorians also bear the O1 haplogroup, which indicates a minor Southeast Asian influence. Maternally, the Comorians primarily belong to the L0, L1, L2 and L3‚Ä≤4(xMN) haplogroups (84.7%). These mtDNA clades are also common among other mainland Bantu populations and at roughly similar proportions. The rest of the Comorian population almost exclusively carries mitochondrial haplogroups associated with Southeast Asia (15.3%), with the B4a1a1-PM, F3b and M7c1c clades (10.6%) and the M(xD, E, M1, M2, M7) paragroup (4%) most frequent. Since no mtDNA haplogroups linked with the Middle East were observed, the gene flow from this region appears to have occurred through male-dominated trade and religious proselytisation. According to Msaidie et al., admixture analysis of the maternal and paternal contributions in the Comoros sample indicates that the Comorian population was formed through tripartite gene flow over the last 2,000 years between Bantu populations in sub-Saharan coastal East Africa, settlers from Iran, and migrants from Southeast Asia. Consequently, most of the Comorian islanders' gene pool is estimated to have derived from Africa (72%), with significant contributions from Western Asia (17%) and Southeast Asia (11%). Overall, the Comorian Shirazi were found to be genetically similar to the Lemba, a Bantu- speaking population inhabiting southeast Africa. Since the Lemba have Semitic cultural traditions and Bantu, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian associated paternal lineages have also been detected among them, the scientists suggest that they and the Comorians may have evolved through parallel demographic processes.

The Star-Times ceased operations in 1951. Both the Globe-Democrat and the rival Post-Dispatch carried on for three more decades, eventually under a joint operating agreement, until the Globe-Democrat, after changing ownership and leaving the agreement, finally ceased operations in October 1986. Casper Yost became editor of the paper in 1889. He later was a founder of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Frederick H. Britton was on the editorial staff of the Globe-Democrat in 1923.Newspaper article, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Dec. 20, 1923. Political commentator, syndicated columnist, author, politician, speechwriter, and broadcaster Pat Buchanan launched his career at the Globe- Democrat in 1961 (at the age of 23) as an editor. =History= The entrance to the Globe-Democrat building in 2012. In their earliest days, the predecessor newspapers which eventually merged to form the St. Louis Globe- Democrat were staunch advocates of freedom and anti-slavery in Missouri. The Globe-Democrat eventually became the most widely read morning paper in St. Louis, with a huge circulation, and used this base of support to promote civic responsibility and great causes regarding urban improvements. A casualty in the 1980s of an antitrust collusion agreement between the heirs of SI Newhouse (Conde Nast, owner) and the St. Louis Post Dispatch to close the Globe and enter into a 50-year profit-sharing arrangement put the Globe-Democrat out of business. In 1968, the Globe-Democrat went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend itself against claims that setting maximum prices for newspaper deliveries violated antitrust law. In Albrecht v. Herald Co., the majority found the paper guilty of vertical price fixing. The Globe-Democrat had operated since 1959 under the protection of the Failing Newspaper Act, under which papers must show proof of irreversible financial losses before closing. The Post- Dispatch, owned by the Pulitzer Publishing Company, handled all printing and publication for both papers. Advertising was sold jointly, and profits were shared equally. In St. Louis, the morning advantage was reduced by the terms of the joint operating agreement entered into by the two papers in 1959 and expanded in 1969 and 1979. The papers shared all business and advertising functions, with only the news functions separate. Until the last fiscal year, the Post-Globe agency, as the joint operation was known, operated in the red. The agency was said to be making a marginal profit that year. In August 1986 the paper filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time the newspaper listed $8 million in debts. In December the newspaper suspended publication. In January 1986 Veritas Corporation purchased the paper for $500,000. Veritas, formed by businessmen John B. Prentis and William E. Franke committed to contribute $4 million to the newspaper's operations. The Globe- Democrat ended publication in October after the newspaper failed to secure a necessary $15 million loan from the state of Missouri. An attorney had challenged the legality of the state's ability to grant that particular bond package, passed in the state legislature earlier that year. The Globe-Democrat Building at 710 N. Tucker Blvd. in downtown St. Louis is still used for office, datacenters, and retail space by various businesses and organizations on a rental basis. This building was built in 1931 and designed by St. Louis firm Mauran, Russell & Crowell. The Globe-Democrat's morgue of articles and photographs is housed in the St. Louis Mercantile Library at the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis. Since 1993 the St. Louis Globe-Democrat has been published as a history and nostalgia paper. This publication was founded as the St. Louis Inquirer in 1986 and later acquired the Globe-Democrat name.

Since much of the trail lies in the flood plain along the Des Plaines River, sections of the trail are occasionally closed due to flooding during periods of heavy rain. Though not all sections of the trail connect directly, there is currently a continuous section running through Lake County starting at Russell Road along the Wisconsin/Illinois state line and running south into Cook County. There are additional disconnected sections south of the town of Des Plaines. Much of the Des Plaines River Trail runs through a protected corridor made up of a series of public lands that are part of the Lake County Forest Preserve District and the Cook County Forest Preserve District. The numerous forest preserves provide additional recreational opportunities along the trail. Underpasses and bridges are used to facilitate many (not all) of the major road crossings (The underpasses are highly prone to flooding during the spring). Cook County Forest Preserve rangers give lectures at various time during the year. There is a nature house where forest animals reside for the public to view. The trails are very calm and beautiful and especially in the fall when the leaves change colors. A peak time to walk the trails is the second or third week in October. You can picnic right next to the Des Plaines River. Towns (north to south) Towns connected by or adjacent to the Des Plaines River Trail: *Wadsworth *Gurnee *Libertyville *Mettawa *Lincolnshire *Riverwoods *Wheeling *Des Plaines *Park Ridge *Schiller Park *Chicago *River Grove Recreational facilities The Des Plaines River Trail contains many recreational facilities, including: *Parks and Preserves, such as the Van Patten Woods, and the Gurnee Woods. *Boating, including rafts, flat bottom boats, and canoes *Fishing *Equestrian facilities *Dog park Animal life The trail is home to numerous forms of wildlife, among them: *Birds, such as blue herons, cranes, woodpeckers, red-tailed hawks, and peregrine falcons. *Fish, including bass, bluegill, and catfish. *Mammals, including beavers, bobcats, chipmunks, coyotes, deer, foxes, possums, skunks, and squirrels. *Invertebrates, such as the tiger beetle, metalmark butterfly, velvet ant, crayfish, water strider, and dragonfly. *Reptiles and amphibians, including the garter snake, box turtle, softshell turtle, and leopard frog. Plant life The trail contains several different ecosystems: plains, woodlands, savannas, and wetlands. In these ecosystems are many varieties of trees, tall grasses and wildflowers, creating a rich abundance of plant life. Safety When traveling along the trail during warmer months, hikers should take proper preventative measures for mosquitoes and ticks. Mosquitoes can carry some forms of encephalitis as well as West Nile virus. Ticks in the region have been known to carry Lyme disease. Although the river and associated ponds are considered fresh water, swimming or consumption is generally not recommended. Most of the river and its tributaries are subject to runoff/drainage as well as heavy usage by local wildfowl, which may cause chemical and/or bacterial contamination.

Its full name is Sakyamuni Yeoraesangjuseolbeop Tap, and is sometimes referred to as the Shadowless Pagoda or the Bulguksa Samcheung Seoktap (\\"three-storied stone pagoda of Bulguksa\\"). The pagoda stands 10.75 meters high, directly across from Dabotap within the Bulguksa Temple complex in Gyeongju, South Korea. It probably dates to around 751, when Bulguksa was completed. Description The Seokgatap pagoda is in distinct contrast with its more elaborate brother the Dabotap. The pagoda is of a very simple and basic design and the three stories have a pleasing 4:3:2 ratio which gives the pagoda a sense of balance, stability, and symmetry. The contrast between the simplicity of the Seokgatap and the complexity of the Dabotap is designed to represent the dual nature of the Buddha's contemplation and detachment from the world or perhaps it symbolizes the celestial versus the terrestrial. The pagoda's three stories rest on a two tiered base. The simplicity of the pagoda is reinforced by the fact that there are no carvings or reliefs on the faces of the pagoda. Although, the pagoda is surrounded by eight lotus flower stones. The top of the pagoda, which is rather elaborate, was added in 1973 to match a pagoda that was built one hundred years after Seokgatap. Construction Asadal was an outstanding stonemason of Baekje who was brought to Silla to build Dabotap and Seokgatap. After several years with no news of her husband, Asadal's young wife went to Seorabeol to find him. However, she was prevented from entering Bulguksa Temple due to the rule that women were not allowed inside until the pagodas were finished. Feeling sorry for the woman wandering the temple surroundings, one monk told Asadal's wife that she would be able to see the pagoda's shadow in the pond once it was completed. However, there was no shadow visible on the pond's surface. Upon hearing rumors that Asadal intended to marry a Silla princess, his wife threw herself into the pond and drowned. By the time Asadal reached the pond after completing the pagoda, his wife was already dead. In tears, Asadal engraved an image of his wife onto a rock before returning home to Baekje. Afterward, Seokgatap was named the \\"Shadowless Pagoda\\" because its shadow was not visible on the pond, while the pond in which Asadal's wife drowned herself was named \\"Shadow Pond.\\" Discovery of treasures In 1966, the monks of the temple were awakened by sounds of exploding dynamite. They discovered that thieves had attempted to blast the pagoda and steal what was hidden inside. The thieves ran away before they could steal any of the treasures but the Buddhist monks discovered precious reliquaries, sariras, and the oldest extant example of printed material from a wood block in the world(.The Great Dharani Sutra) =National treasure No.126= A sarira is a reliquary that contains the remains of an esteemed monk or sometimes royalty. After the failed theft by robbers, workers refurbishing and repairing the pagoda found the treasures hidden inside. Notably, the Dabotap pagoda was dismantled by the Japanese for repairs during the 1920s but no record mentions any treasure recovered. Treasures included a bronze image of a Buddhist spirit, a bronze mirror, a miniature wooden pagoda, silk, perfume, gogok, and beads. A bundle of papers were found in the foundation of the pagoda but they are illegible. The sarira box is shaped like a house, and has an engraved roof. Each of the walls of the case have an engraved vine pattern that runs up to the roof. Lotus motifs are used throughout as well and the top of the roof has a leaf-shaped ornamentation. The oldest extant woodblock print is a copy of the Mugujeonggwang Great Dharani Sutra. The text is the oldest extant printed material in the world for several reasons. The pagoda itself was built in 751, the print had to have been made before that date and no other printed material dates before 750-751 CE. It is 620 centimeters in length and eight centimeters in width. The print contains, on average, eight to nine characters per line. The print has deteriorated due to oxidation and restorations in 1988 and 1989 were carried out to preserve the print.

Walsh brothers Brothers Leo and Vivian Walsh built a Howard Wright biplane in 1910 and flew it on 5 February 1911. In August 1911, the aircraft crashed but it was later rebuilt by the brothers and converted into an entirely new aircraft, with a streamlined nacelle positioned between the wings, which had a swept outer bay, while the canard was replaced by a conventional tailplane. The New Zealand Flying School During 1914 the Walsh brothers constructed a two-seat flying boat similar to a Curtiss design. The war broke out in August 1914, and the Curtiss-based design was modified with dual controls to become a trainer and first flown on 1 January 1915. In October 1915, the brothers founded the New Zealand Flying School to train men for the Royal Flying Corps. The first class of three included the fighter ace, Keith Caldwell. Classes were always small but, in contrast to overseas training, comprehensive. Evolution of the Curtiss design Due to the difficulties in obtaining suitable training aircraft, the Walsh brothers decided to build their own trainers, initially based on the Curtiss pattern. Over the next four years they produced a series of four flying boat designs, evolved from, but bearing little resemblance to, the original Curtiss model. The last of the Walsh Brothers designs, the Type D of 1919, was an aerodynamically and hydrodynamically advanced machine, with a powerful Beardmore engine. Sale to NZPAF The flying school struggled to gain clients after the war, and all assets of the flying school were acquired for the New Zealand Permanent Air Force (NZPAF) in 1924. All Walsh brothers flying boats had been made for the use of the school, not for sale, and were transferred to the NZPAF; however, the NZPAF had a landplane training programme based upon the Avro 504K and had no use for the flying boats. The survivors are believed to have been burnt on the Auckland waterfront, however there are \\"lost treasure\\" stories that these and some of the other machines used by the flying school are stored on a defence force base at Devonport in tunnels bricked up after the Second World War.

Although it called itself a party, it did not have official members but instead had participants. It could not, and did not wish to, participate in elections. The professed goal of the group was to undermine the capitalist system. It was founded by different parts of the Swedish extra-parliamentary left, in particular the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation. The Invisible Party \\"disbanded\\" after a September 16, 2006 press release by the \\"central committee\\" behind the campaign declaring that they would discontinue their activities: Ideology An Invisible Party banner at a demonstration in Stockholm, June 3, 2006 organized by the Pirate Party amongst others. The banner reads: \\"Everything for everyone. Online & IRL\\". The Invisible Party can be seen as a shared concept, a symbol for a struggle against capitalism and the perceived exploitation of the workforce. Participation in the party has involved strikes, blockades, flyposting, sabotage, shoplifting, riots, and other radical tactics. Anna-Lena Lodenius, a Swedish author on political extremism, has described the Invisible Party as follows: The leftist website Motkraft described the views of the group as follows: Methods After the Centre Party proposed a special youth contract for those under 26 (similar to France's First Employment Contract policy), activists claiming to be members of the Invisible Party responded by vandalizing Centre Party offices throughout Sweden. The Centre Party was in opposition at the time. Activists under the banner of the Invisible Party continued the vandalism throughout the 2006 Swedish general election campaign, hitting the offices of the Christian Democrats, another opposition party, as well.http://www.city.se/TT/TT.asp?Id=45856 As of 2006, the Swedish Security Service (S√§po) was gathering information about the Invisible Party and its supporters. Controversy The Invisible Party was widely misunderstood outside the extra-parliamentary left. Media presented the party as an actual organization with members in the strict and traditional sense. Because of the actions against the Centre Party the party was vilified by Swedish media and presented as a violent and anti-democratic organization. This led to the true purpose of the campaign becoming even more obscure than before. The winner of the Swedish political reality show Toppkandidaterna (The Top Candidates), Petter Nilsson, donated 100,000 of his 250,000 SEK prize-money to the project. After the actions against the Centre Party, the party demanded that the license-funded public broadcaster SVT should ask Nilsson to repay the money, and the Centre Party Youth claimed that SVT was \\"responsible for the attacks\\", gp.se: Centerf√∂rbund: SVT ansvarigt f√∂r skadeg√∂relsen mot v√•ra lokaler but SVT chose not to take any action against Nilsson. sr.se: Prispengar fr√•n SVT st√∂der protest mot c See also * Anarchism * Alter-globalization (or Anti- globalization) * Distributive justice * The Global Economy * Politics of Sweden * direct action Notes External links * News about activity in the Invisible Party * Newsblog about the Invisible Party * Motkraft.net * Resum√©: \\"SVT bekostar 'Osynliga partiets' sajt\\" * SvD: \\"Osynliga partiet bj√∂d p√• saft\\" * The Local: \\"More Centre Party offices vandalised\\" * The Local: \\"New attack on Centre Party offices\\" Political organizations based in Sweden Anti-capitalism ","title":"Invisible Party"},{"id":"4991421","text":"John F.

They are most likely a blend of Micronesian, Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry. The origin of the Nauruan people has not yet been finally determined. It was probably seafaring or shipwrecked Polynesians or Melanesians, who established themselves there because there was not already an indigenous population present, whereas the Micronesians were already crossed with the Melanesians in this area. The Nauruans have two elements of their population: the native Micronesians and the Polynesians who had immigrated long before. The Micronesians are represented through coarse, dark hair; the Polynesians are lighter brown and have smoother, black hair. Through these two extremes the diverse traditions came to exist. At about 1920, influenza spread through Nauru, which took a heavy toll on the Nauruans. In 1925, the first cases of diabetes was diagnosed by doctors.

Much of the railway cuts across the vast, rolling Kazakh Steppe The broad gauge Trans-Aral Railway (also known as the Tashkent Railway) was built in 1906 connecting Kinel and Tashkent, then both in the Russian Empire.Coulibaly, S Deichmann, U et al (2012) Eurasian Cities: New Realities along the Silk Road, World Bank Publications, P26 For the first part of the 20th century it was the only railway connection between European Russia and Central Asia. An extensive description of the newly built railway was published in 1910. Construction history Railway station in Tashkent 1903 There were plans to construct the Orenburg-Tashkent line as early as 1874. Construction work did not start, however, until the autumn of 1900. The railway was simultaneously built from both ends toward a common junction. It opened in January 1906, linking the existing network of Russian and European railways to the Trans-Caspian Railway. On January 1, 1905, the Kinel - Orenburg section of the Samara-Zlatoust line was joined to the Tashkent railway. The Kinel-Tashkent Railway was the first line to be built across the steppe, replacing the multiple routes once used by caravans with a single, steel path. It introduced the Kazakhs to industrial modernity and tied the distant Governor-Generalship of Turkestan more firmly to the Russian metropole, allowing troops to be rushed to Central Asia and raw cotton to be exported to Moscow‚Äôs textile mills. Economic impact Because of the American Civil War, cotton shot up in price in the 1860s, becoming an increasingly important commodity in the region, although its cultivation was on a much lesser scale than during the Soviet period. The cotton trade led to the construction of these railroads. In the long term the development of a cotton monoculture would render Turkestan dependent on food imports from Western Siberia, and the Turkestan-Siberia Railway was already planned when the First World War broke out. Post-revolutionary period After the revolution the line was blocked by Cossacks under the command of Ataman Dutov. Cut off from food supplies, and unable to sustain itself due to forced cotton cultivation, Russian Turkestan experienced an intense famine. The temporary loss of the Trans-Aral also allowed the Tashkent Soviet a degree of autonomy from Moscow during the period immediately following the Bolshevik takeover, which resulted in atrocities like the Kokand Massacre, in which between 5,000 and 14,000 people were killed. Route The line passes through several notable cities in Kazakhstan, including Aral, Qyzylorda, Turkistan, and Shymkent. It connects at Arys with the Turkestan-Siberia rail line toward Almaty, eastern Kazakhstan, and south Siberia.

The composite good represents what is given up along consumer's budget constraint to consume more of the first good. Reason for use Budget constraints are designed to show the maximum amount of a good, or combination of goods, that can be purchased by a consumer given a limited budget. In a single-good world, the cost of a good cannot be related to any other opportunities. Therefore, opportunity costs cannot be calculated. The addition of one new good to a single-good market allows for opportunity costs to be determined only in relation to that other good. However, its weakness is that it ignores all other possible choices. Trying to solve this problem by adding even more goods to the market makes analysis unwieldy. Under these circumstances, economic modelers are forced to choose between goods in order to create a simple model. The concept of the composite good addresses this problem. The addition of a composite good in a single-good model (bringing it up to two) allows for all other opportunities to be accounted for. Since the composite is considered a single good only for purposes of the model, analysis can be made on a two-dimensional graph. Optimal choices represent the bundle of two goods; the first good and the composite. A final step can be taken in relating the composite good to a unit of account such as money by setting the price of the composite good to 1. Since the prices of all other goods are known, the composite good can be converted into any combination of bundles that represent the optimal choice other than the first good. This final step clarifies the relation of the model to the real world where many goods can be stated in terms of money value. In John R. Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939), a composite good was used to generalize mathematically from consumer demand equilibrium for an individual in the 2-good case to market equilibrium via supply and demand in the n-good case.

Christmas bells are tufted, perennial herbs with narrow, linear leaves and up to twenty large, drooping, cylindrical or bell-shaped flowers. Description Plants in the genus Blandfordia are tufted, perennial herbaceous monocots with fleshy, fibrous or tuber-like roots from a corm. The leaves are narrow linear, usually crowded in two ranks from the base of the flowering stem. Up to twenty flowers are arranged near the top of the flowering stem that has small, leaf-like bracts. The flowers are usually red with yellow lobes. The sepals and petals are fused to form a tube-shaped, cylindrical or bell-shaped flower with six lobes about one-fifth the length of the tube. There are six stamens fused to the inside wall of the flower tube and the style is linear. Flowering occurs in spring or summer and is followed by the fruit which is a capsule, tapered at both ends and containing a large number of hairy brown seeds. Taxonomy and naming The genus Blandfordia was first formally described in 1804 by James Edward Smith from dried specimens sent from Sydney by the colonial surgeon, John White. Smith published the description in Exotic Botany. The name Blandfordia honours George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough, the Marquis of Blandford. The type species is Blandfordia nobilis as it was the first described by Smith. Blandfordia placed in the family Blandfordiaceae of the order Asparagales of the monocots. It is the sole genus in the family Blandfordiaceae. Such a family has only recently been recognized by taxonomists. The APG IV system of 2016 (unchanged from the 1998, 2003 and 2009 versions) recognizes this family. Previously various families were suggested. Four species of are accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: * Blandfordia cunninghamii Lindl. (New South Wales) * Blandfordia grandiflora R.Br. (Queensland, New South Wales) * Blandfordia nobilis Sm. (New South Wales) * Blandfordia punicea (Labill.) Sweet (Tasmania) Distribution and habitat Two of the four species of Blandfordia are restricted to New South Wales, a third also occurs in Queensland, and the fourth only occurs in Tasmania. Christmas bells usually grow in heathlands, especially waterlogged sites and mostly in coastal or near-coastal areas although some populations occur on the tablelands. Use in horticulture The large, distinctive flowers and long vase life of Blandfordia suggest good commercial potential for the cut flower trade and a small group of producers cater to the domestic and export markets. It is a protected species and in the past over-collecting has caused localised extinction and damage to the habitat of the species.

It operates a college, academy, and lifestyle-oriented health care center. It highlights traditional Seventh-day Adventist principles of health and education, especially as espoused by early Seventh-day Adventist founder Ellen G. White, who wrote extensively on health and education. Although founded by Adventists, it has never been legally affiliated with the Seventh- day Adventist Church.  History  Weimar Institute is located on the property formerly occupied by the Weimar Joint Sanatorium (AKA Weimar Chest Center and Weimar Medical Center), which operated from 1919 to 1972.The Weimar Joint Sanatorium and the Weimar Cemetery Following the closure, the property changed hands several times and in 1975 it reopened as Hope Village, a temporary relocation center for Vietnamese refugees.Weimar Center of Health & Education website \\"About Weimar\\" Retrieved 2011-06-07. In May 1977, a group of Seventh-day Adventists purchased the . In 1978 it was registered as the nonprofit organization, Weimar Institute of Health & Education, and Weimar College was opened. In 1981 Weimar Academy was established as a private four- year Christian boarding high school. In early 2008, Weimar Institute announced that it would close Weimar College at the end of June 2008. Later that year, however, the institute merged with Amazing Facts and a combined board was established to oversee the operations of Weimar Institute and its divisions.Adventist News, Adventist Review, May 8, 2008 An announcement stated: : \\"After two years of heartfelt prayer, study, discussion, and observing the leading of the Lord, Amazing Facts and Weimar Institute voted on April 6, 2008 to proceed with a bold new joint venture. Their respective boards approved an agreement whereby the operations of Weimar Institute will be administered by Amazing Facts with a new board of directors providing direction to both ministries.\\" Subsequent to the decision to jointly operate Weimar, it was realized that operating a college, academy, and lifestyle center required a quite different focus than operating a media ministry and that Amazing Facts and Weimar Institute would be better served to operate cooperatively, but separately and the two separated amicably. Amazing Facts and Weimar Institute continue to work cooperatively.. A long-term focus of Weimar has been the NEWSTART Program. The NEWSTART Program is part of Weimar's health care program and is primarily focused on lifestyle based crisis intervention and training for recovery from diabetes and life-threatening heart problems. NEWSTART is an acronym and stands for Nutrition, Exercise, Water, Sunlight, Temperance, Air, Rest, and Trust (in Divine Power).  Academics  In 1978, Weimar College opened on the semester system. It now offers a BA in Christian Education, BA in Religion, BBA in Business Administration, BS in Natural Sciences, AS in Nursing, BS in Nursing, BA in Interdisciplinary Studies, and a lifestyle and health coach certificate. In the past, Weimar College has been affiliated with Griggs University. According to the college 2011-2012 academic bulletin, this affiliation enabled completion of select degrees through Griggs University. In the fall of 2012, Weimar College discontinued their association with Griggs University and no longer offer Griggs University credits. Perusal of accreditation through the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) began during the 2009-2010 academic year as reflected in the corresponding academic bulletin. The WASC Senior College and University Commission granted eligibility to Weimar Institute during the 2015-2016 academic year. In February 2017, the institute was granted candidacy status for a period of five years during which the college could advance to initial accreditation if the commission's qualifications were met. According to the March 2017 accreditation progress report, the institute was scheduled to receive a visit from the WASC commission to determine eligibility for initial accreditation in the fall of 2018. In the subsequent commission report, the institute was granted initial accreditation for a period of six years retroactive to January 1, 2018. Currently, the institute has approval to operate under the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education.  Nursing program  On May 18, 2011, the college requested a study of the feasibility of starting an associate degree Nursing program. It has a state-approved pre-nursing program and started an associate's degree program in nursing that began in Fall 2015, with state approval from the California Board of Registered Nursing. In May 2019, the institute announced a new bachelor of science in nursing program which accepted its first cohort of students for the fall of 2019.

Background De Burgh was the fifth and last surviving son of Richard, Lord of Connaught and Earl of Ulster. His elder brother, John de Burgh, died at Galway in 1313 and was survived by a son, William, who became the 3rd Earl of Ulster. Edmond lived in what is now County Limerick, where his personal estates lay. He was the father of at least two children, Sir Richard Burke and Sir David Burke, both of whom were alive in 1387. Sir Richard was the father of Walter (died 1432) and Uileag Carragh, who were the ancestor of the Burkes of Castleconnell and Brittas, and Burkes of Cois tSi√∫ire, respectively. Sir David was the ancestor of the Burkes of Muskerryquirk. All three septs would be collectively referred to as the Burkes of Clanwilliam. Burke Civil War The murder of William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster in June 1333 led to a three-way struggle among the leading members of the de Burgh/Burke family for supremacy. Edmond was the senior male member of the family, as he was uncle to William Donn and eldest surviving son of the 2nd Earl. He fought against his cousins in Connacht in an attempt to control the vast de Burgh estates, both for his personal estates and that of his grand-niece, Elizabeth de Burgh. Because none of the three main contenders could overcome each other, the de Burgh lands in Ulster were almost entirely regained by the Gaelic-Irish, while Connaught was split in half between the cousins Edmond Albanach de Burgh of north Connacht (mainly County Mayo) and Ulick Burke of Annaghkeen in south Connacht (mainly east County Galway). By 1340, the family had divided into three separate, independent lordships: * Clan William Burke of County Limerick * Mac William √çochtar of County Mayo * Clanricarde of County Galway Death Edmond died in 1338 when he and his men were trying to visit the Augustinian Friars in the town of Ballinrobe. A band of men headed by Edmond Albanach Burke forcibly entered the monastery and seized Edmond after a short resistance. Edmond was taken prisoner and carried all the way to Oilean-an-lara (the Earls Island). He was drowned in Lough Mask. The incident is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters: * M1338.3. The son of the Earl of Ulster, i.e. Edmond, was taken prisoner by Edmond Burke, who fastened a stone to his neck and drowned him in Lough Mask. The destruction of the English of Connaught, and of his own in particular, resulted from this deed. Turlough O'Conor afterwards banished Edmond Mac William Burke out of Connaught, after the territories and churches of the west of Connaught had been greatly destroyed between them; and O'Conor then assumed the sway of the whole province.

The Armorines armor first appeared on the last page X-O Manowar #24 (January 1994), but the entire Armorines fully appeared in Armorines #0 (February 1994) which is a special comic insert in X-O Manowar #25 (February 1994). Fictional team biography The U.S. Government took X-O Manowar as a threat. The Armorines were created by Dr. Phillip Zahn to deal with this threat. After they got the go ahead on the project from Senator Ackerman, Colonel Gardner recruited eight soldiers to function as the Armorines. Four would be trained as the field agents with the other four acting as their co- pilots from the base. Gunny Lewis, an aging war veteran, was chosen to be their field leader. Ackerman, however, made it perfectly clear to Gardner that he wanted Lewis out of the program as soon as the others were properly trained to function without him. Initially a truce between X-O and the Government was formed, but this irritated CIA agent Peter Garrett and his associate, Ms. Mandrake of the IRS. The two forged orders from the Government which ordered the Armorines to take out X-O and sent them to Gardner. The Armorines attacked X-O and may have even defeated him, but their attack was called off by orders from General Kendall. Colonel Gardner was arrested for ordering the attack, and Kendall took his place as head of the Armorines. Meanwhile, the Armorine Sirot, who is also an agent of the National Security Agency, met with Garrett and forged a truce of sorts. The Armorines went on to face other threats, but their biggest adversaries were the Spider Aliens. They first faced them underwater, and then in a huge battle in space. They were teamed with X-O Manowar and the H.A.R.D. Corps in the space battle. While they were in space fighting the aliens, the Chaos Effect broke out on Earth cutting off all communication with the military. Eventually the Chaos ended, the Spider Aliens were defeated, and the Armorines returned home. The Armorines received medals of honor from the President himself upon their return. At the same time, however, Senator Ackerman ordered Gunny out of the Armorines program. When the President found out about this, he wrote a presidential order that took away Ackerman's control over the program and ensured that Gunny would remain in the Armorines. This didn't sit too well with Ackerman, so with Peter Garrett's help, he devised a plan to get Gunny out of the program anyway. The two rigged a hidden camera on Sirot's armor and shot footage of the destruction of a building on one of the Armorine's missions. Ackerman used this footage as a way to frame Gunny. If Gunny didn't leave the program, the footage would be used to ruin his career. He chose to leave. Sergeant William Sturgess was sent as his replacement.

Holes are generally assigned par values between three and five. A typical 18-hole golf course will have a total par around 72, and a 9-hole par-3 course (where all holes are rated as par 3) will have a total par of 27. Determination of par Par is primarily determined by the playing length of each hole from the teeing ground to the putting green. Holes are generally assigned par values between three and five, which includes a regulation number of strokes to reach the green based on the average distance a proficient golfer hits the ball, and two putts. On occasion, factors other than distance are taken into account when setting the par for a hole; these include altitude, terrain and obstacles that result in a hole playing longer or shorter than its measured distance, e.g. route is significantly uphill or downhill, or requiring play of a stroke to finish short of a body of water before hitting over it. In general, for men par-3 holes will be under from the tee to the green, par-4 holes will be , par-5 holes will be and par-6 holes will be over . For women, par-3 holes will be under from the tee to the green, par-4 holes will be , par-5 holes will be and par-6 holes will be over These boundaries are commonly extended upwards for elite tournament players, who will often encounter par-4 holes of or more; this is often the result of a normal par-5 hole being rated as a par-4 for them. Some golf courses feature par-7 holes, but these are not recognised by the United States Golf Association. Course and tournament scores A golfer's score is compared with the par score. If a course has a par of 72 and a golfer takes 75 strokes to complete the course, the reported score is +3, or \\"three-over-par\\" and takes three shots more than par to complete the course. If a golfer takes 70 strokes, the reported score is ‚àí2, or \\"two-under-par\\". Tournament scores are reported by totalling scores relative to par in each round (there are usually four rounds in professional tournaments). If each of the four rounds has a par of 72, the tournament par would be 288. For example, a golfer could record a 70 in the first round, a 72 in the second round, a 73 in the third round, and a 69 in the fourth round. That would give a tournament score of 284, or \\"four-under-par\\". Hole scores Scores on each hole are reported in the same way that course scores are given. Names are commonly given to scores on holes relative to par. =Bogey= A score of one stroke more than par (+1) for a hole is known as a bogey, e.g. 4 strokes to complete a par 3 hole or 6 strokes on a par 5 hole. The first meaning of bogey in golf was the number of strokes a good golfer should take at each hole, and first came into use at the Great Yarmouth Golf Club in 1890, based on the phrase \\"bogey man\\" and a popular music hall song Here Comes the Bogey Man. Notionally, players competed against Colonel Bogey, and this gave the title to a 1914 marching tune, Colonel Bogey March. As golf became more standardised in the United States, par scores were tightened and recreational golfers found themselves scoring over par, with bogey changing meaning to one-over-par. Scores in excess of one stroke more than par for a hole are known as double- bogey (two strokes more than par, +2), triple-bogey (three strokes more than par, +3), and so on. For higher hole scores it is more common for them to be referred to by the number of strokes, or strokes relative to par, rather than as a \\"n-tuple bogey\\". It is considered an achievement to complete a bogey-free round. Completing four bogey-free rounds in professional tournament play is rare. Examples are Lee Trevino at the 1974 Greater New Orleans Open; David J. Russell at the 1992 Lyon Open V33; Jesper Parnevik at the 1995 Volvo Scandinavian Masters; Manuel Pi√±ero at the 2002 GIN Monte Carlo Invitational; Diana Luna at the 2011 UniCredit Ladies German Open; and Jonas Blixt and Cameron Smith at the 2017 Zurich Classic of New Orleans (a team event). Each of them won the tournament except Pi√±ero, who finished third. =Par= A hole score equal to the par of the hole is simply called a par. =Birdie= A hole score of one stroke fewer than par (one under par, ‚àí1) is known as a birdie, e.g. 2 strokes to complete a par 3 hole or 4 strokes on a par 5 hole. This expression was coined in 1899, at the Atlantic City Country Club in Northfield, New Jersey. According to a story that has been passed down, one day in 1899, three golfers, George Crump (who later built Pine Valley Golf Club, about 45 miles away), William Poultney Smith (founding member of Pine Valley), and his brother Ab Smith, were playing together when Crump hit his second shot only inches from the cup on a par-four hole after his first shot had struck a bird in flight. Simultaneously, the Smith brothers exclaimed that Crump's shot was \\"a bird\\". Crump's short putt left him one-under-par for the hole, and from that day, the three of them referred to such a score as a \\"birdie\\". In short order, the entire membership of the club began using the term. As the Atlantic City Country Club, being a resort, had many out-of-town visitors, the expression spread and caught the fancy of all American golfers. Price's book is required reading for all membership applicants to the PGA. The perfect round (score of 54 on a par-72 course) is most commonly described as scoring a birdie on all 18 holes, but no player has ever recorded a perfect round in a professional tournament. During the 2009 RBC Canadian Open, Mark Calcavecchia scored nine consecutive birdies at the second round, breaking the PGA Tour record. =Eagle= A hole score of two strokes fewer than par (two under par, ‚àí2) is known as an eagle, e.g. 2 strokes to complete a par 4 hole or 3 strokes on a par 5 hole. The name \\"eagle\\" was used to represent a better score than a birdie due to it being a relatively large bird. An eagle usually occurs when a golfer hits the ball far enough to reach the green with fewer strokes than expected. It most commonly happens on par-fives but can occur on short par-fours. A hole in one on a par-three hole also results in an eagle. =Albatross= A hole score of three strokes fewer than par (three under par, ‚àí3) is known as an albatross (the albatross being one of the largest birds); also called a double eagle in the US, e.g. 2 strokes to complete a par 5 hole. It is an extremely rare score and occurs most commonly on par-fives with a strong drive and a holed approach shot. Holes-in-one on par-four holes (generally short ones) are also albatrosses. The first famous albatross was made by Gene Sarazen in 1935 on the 15th hole at Augusta National Golf Club during the final round of the Masters Tournament. It vaulted him into a tie for first place and forced a playoff, which he won the next day. The sportswriters of the day termed it \\"the shot heard 'round the world\\". Between 1970 and 2003, 84 such shots (averaging about 2.5 per year) were recorded on the PGA Tour. Recent well-publicised albatrosses include those by Joey Sindelar at the 2006 PGA Championship, only the third in that competition's history; Miguel √Ångel Jim√©nez while defending his BMW PGA Championship title in 2009; Paul Lawrie in the final round of the 2009 Open Championship; Shaun Micheel on the final day of the 2010 U.S. Open, only the second ever in that competition; P√°draig Harrington in the 2010 WGC-HSBC Champions; Louis Oosthuizen on the final day of the 2012 Masters Tournament, the fourth in that competition's history, the first to be televised, and the first on Augusta's par-five second hole; Rafael Cabrera-Bello at the 2017 Players Championship; and Brooks Koepka at the 2018 Players Championship. =Condor= Condor is an unofficial name for a hole score of four strokes fewer than par (four under par, ‚àí4). This is the lowest individual hole score ever made, relative to par. A condor would be a hole-in-one on a par-five (typically by cutting over a dogleg corner), a two on a par-six or a three on a par-seven (neither of which has ever been achieved as of December 2016). Par-sixes are exceptionally rare, as are par-sevens. As of October 2008, a condor had been recorded only four times, once reportedly on a straight drive (a record , aided by the thin air at high altitude in Denver) and never during a professional tournament. One condor was reportedly achieved with a 3-iron club (in 1995 on a horseshoe- shaped par-5 hole). A condor is also known as a double albatross, or a triple eagle.

It was known to be conservative in domestic, social and economic policies, pro-NATO, and pro-European. In 1978, the Republican Party allied with centrist groups to form the Union for French Democracy (UDF), a confederation created in order to support President Giscard d'Estaing and counterbalance the influence of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) over the French centre-right. However, after Giscard d'Estaing's defeat at the 1981 presidential election, the PR gravitated away from its founder and a new generation of politicians, led by Fran√ßois L√©otard, took the lead. This group called la bande √† L√©o (\\"L√©o(tard)'s band\\"), advocated an alliance with the RPR and covertly supported RPR leader Jacques Chirac's candidacy in the 1988 presidential election, against the official UDF candidate Raymond Barre.

History  Yogyakarta State University (formerly IKIP Yogyakarta or Yogyakarta Institute of Teacher Education and Educational Sciences) was founded on May 21, 1964. IKIP Yogyakarta was a merger of two educational institutions: the Faculty of Pedagogy of Gadjah Mada University and the Institute of Teacher Education. They offered study programs of education sciences and teacher education. The merger was mandated by the Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia, Number I/1963. On August 4, 1999, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, by Presidential Decree No. 93/1999, officially declared that IKIP Yogyakarta was converted into Yogyakarta State University (abbreviated as YSU) with a wider mandate. This university is also legitimate to offer non-education study programs. The conversion of IKIP Yogyakarta into a university was based on some considerations. One of them is the observation that the organizational structure of an educational institution was insufficient to support scientific development and that the number of graduates of IKIP Yogyakarta who entered non-teaching fields also increased. In carrying out the wider mandate, YSU initially offered 12 non-education study programs at the bachelor level and three-year undergraduate diploma levels in the following faculties: the Faculty of Languages and Arts Education, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Education, and the Faculty of Engineering and Vocational Education. The non-education study programs include those offered in the Faculty of Sport Sciences and the Faculty of Economics. To meet societal demands, in 2011 the Faculty of Social Sciences and Economics was divided into two separate faculties: the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Faculty of Economics. This was mandated through the Ministerial Decree No. 23/2011 about the Organization and Governance of YSU signed on 22 June 2011. YSU then has seven faculties. As has been mentioned above, IKIP Yogyakarta was converted into YSU on August 4, 1999. However, the anniversary of IKIP Yogyakarta remains YSU‚Äôs anniversary, i.e., May 21.

John Strachan was born on a farm, Crichie, near St. Katherines in Aberdeenshire. His father had made his fortune by trading in horses, and had rented the farm. From 1886 John attended Robert Gordon's College as a boarder in Aberdeen. In 1888 he moved with his father to Craigies in Tarves. In 1895 he moved back to Crichie, which became his own farm in 1897. It was still rented, but he bought it in 1918. By 1939 he was successful enough to own five farms. He became president of the Turriff Agricultural Association. He died in Crichie. Traditional songs John Strachan was a \\"tradition bearer\\". He was part of the last generation to sing traditional songs in bothies, along with Davie Stewart, Jimmy MacBeath and Willie Scott, though he never met them, as far as we know. A dancing master visited the farms. The farm labourers would learn to dance the highland fling and sword dances, at that time performed in hard shoes. John was dismissive of the modern fashion to perform Highland dancing in soft shoes, or \\"Patent slippers\\" as he called them. He learned songs from his mother and from the servants on his father's farm. His social status was higher than almost all other recorded singers of ballads. He was refused entry to a fraternity called \\"The Horseman's Word\\", intended for farmservants who looked after horses. They claimed to be able to control horses through whispering special words in a horse's ear. In 1930 the American collector James Madison Carpenter came from Harvard with a wax cylinder recorder. He reached Crichie about midnight. Strachan sang \\"Dark and Shallow Water\\" for Carpenter. Strachan had learned the song from Jimmy Smith. Later they both travelled over 50 miles to find him, only to discover that he had forgotten the song. Carpenter was sufficiently impressed by Strachan to invite him to return to the States with him, but he refused. In 1935 a radio program \\"The Farm Year\\" was broadcast live from Crichie. Using songs, stories and authentic sound effects such as bagpipes and revving cars, they dramatised farm work. John Strachan and another singer, Willie Kemp, took part. John Mearns sang \\"The Bonnie Lass o' Fyvie\\" on the broadcast. Fyvie is about 3 miles from Crichie. On 16 July 1951, John Strachan sang the song for Alan Lomax who recorded it using a portable tape recorder. It is the earliest known recording of the song. Some of the recordings made that year were issued commercially on \\"Folk Songs of Britain\\" in 1960, but the fullest version was in 2002 on the album Songs from Aberdeenshire.

I Had Some Far Better Verses Than That [interview] John Strachan had a repertoire of songs that had been passed down by word of mouth, probably in this same locality, for over 200 years.

The Corries recorded it in 1965. On the album, Strachan sings \\"Lang Johnnie More\\", 43 verses long, lasting almost 13 minutes, to the tune of \\"Caul Kail in Aberdeen\\". Just afterwards, he said \\"Noo it's too long that\\". In 1851, probably nobody would have thought it unusual to sing songs as long as that. Strachan must have known many bawdy songs but seemed reluctant to sing them. He gave us a fragment of \\"The Ball of Kirriemuir\\", also known as \\"Four and Twenty Virgins went up to Inverness\\".

He was a source of traditional songs for singers of the mid 20th century Folk Revival in Great Britain. Life Jimmy MacBeath (pronounced the same as Macbeth) was born to a family of Scottish Travellers in the fishing village of Portsoy, Banffshire, Scotland. He learned songs such as \\"Lord Randall\\" (Child Ballad 12) from his mother. At the age of 13 he started work as a live-in farm hand at Deskford. He was a bachelor all his life and learned many songs in the bothies, or farm huts where the male farm workers lived. He was to be a traveller for much of his life; in 1908 he took his first long walk, from Inverness to Perth. In the First World War he joined the Gordon Highlanders and fought in Flanders. Later he served in the Medical Corps during the Anglo-Irish War. In the 1920s he was demobbed. Working as a kitchen porter, begging and at seasonal fruit picking, he set about tramping the roads of Scotland, England, the Channel Islands, and even Nova Scotia. In the streets, pubs, hiring fairs and markets he earned money by singing. It is even said that he sang in cinemas where there was no piano for silent films. He tended to wander during the summer, and spend the winter in Elgin. He died in Tor-Na-Dee Hospital in Aberdeen and was buried in Portsoy. Singing career Jimmy MacBeath was a \\"traditional singer\\". He was part of the last generation to sing traditional songs in bothies, along with John Strachan, and Willie Scott, In the 1920s he travelled the roads with Davie Stewart, who was also a singer, and who played the bagpipes and accordion. Their styles were very different, so one sang while the other collected. He lived in \\"model lodging houses\\", government-run houses for homeless men, slightly better than \\"flophouses\\". In 1951 Alan Lomax and Hamish Henderson were in Turriff, when they heard about Jimmy in Elgin. At the prospect of living at the expense of Columbia Records, he came to Turriff and stayed at one of the best hotel rooms. In 1952 he went to London to appear on the earliest folk series on British television. For many years he was popular in folk clubs. When he sang \\"The Barnyards of Delgaty\\" at the 1951 Edinburgh People's Festival Ceilidh, the audience were rapturous. ;Repertoire A number of the songs he sang has been passed on to singers involved in the early times of the Folk Revival in England and Scotland e.g. \\"The Keach in the Creel\\" and \\"Tramps and Hawkers\\". Peter Kennedy's collection Folksongs of Britain and Ireland (1975) included 13 of Jimmy MacBeath's songs. His songs and interviews have examples of beggar's cant, a secret language. *Gadgie in this keer - manager in this place * manashee - girl These words are Romany, and ultimately Hindi. He also sang songs in Doric dialect, such as \\"Fae Would Be a Fisherman's Wife?\\". For lovers of the occult, track 11 on CD 2 of \\"Two Gentlemen of the Road\\", is of interest. He describes the initiation ceremony of \\"The Horseman's Word\\", a kind of Masonic organisation for horsemen wanting to control horses using secret words. They met between midnight and 1 a.m. and asked the initiate as series of questions, including \\"Was the road crooked or straight?\\" - \\"The Road was dark and crooked. I come by the light of the moon\\". He would be harnessed and dragged through chaff‚Äîbroken fragments of dry sharp stalks of wheat. The initiate would have to shake hands with a young calf. This might be interpreted as greeting the devil. The initiate wore a tricorne hat, and heard obscure words recited from a book. Alan Lomax's response is \\"Sounds like witchcraft to me\\". MacBeath is very sceptical about the whole affair. There is no way of knowing whether this is a centuries-old ceremony, or a scam dreamed up in the 19th century to prevent outsiders from getting work as horsemen.

It is the amount of incident signal temperature that would be needed to match the internal noise of the detector such that the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to one. Often the spectrum of the NET is reported as a temperature per root bandwidth. A detector that measures power is often interested in the analogous noise-equivalent power (NEP). If a relation between intensity and temperature is well defined over the pass band, as in the case of a blackbody, then the NET simply scales with the NEP. If a detector is limited by either shot noise or Johnson noise then the NET can be decreased by using an increased integration time. The NET of flicker noise limited detectors can not be reduced by increased integration time. Typically uncooled bolometric detectors have NET figures of 30-200 mK. Cooled photon detecting infrared detectors using materials such as HgCdTe (LWIR or MWIR) or InSb (MWIR) can approach a NET figure of 10 mK. In the microwave radiation region NET values are typically several hundred millikelvins to several kelvins. For a particular mean signal temperature there is a fundamental limit to NET given by the natural thermodynamic fluctuations of the photon flux from the source under investigation.

Lovecraft in September 1922 and published in the February 1924 issue of Weird Tales. It contains the first mention of Lovecraft's fictional text the Necronomicon. Plot The story focuses around the narrator and his friend, St. John, who have a deranged interest in robbing graves. They constantly defile crypts and often keep souvenirs of their nocturnal expeditions. Since they reside in the same house, they have the opportunity to set up a sort of morbid museum in their basement. Using the objects collected from the various graves they have robbed, the two men organize a private exhibition. The collection consists of headstones, preserved bodies, skulls, and several heads in different phases of decomposition. It also included statues, frightful paintings, and a locked portfolio bound in tanned human-skin. One day, they learn of a particular grave, which sparks a profound interest in them, an old grave in a Holland cemetery, which holds a legendary tomb raider within. One who is said to have stolen, many years ago, a \\"potent thing from an mighty sepulcher.\\" One night, they travel into this old cemetery where the ancient ‚Äúghoul‚Äù was buried. The thought of exhuming the final resting place of a former grave robber is irresistibly appealing to them. That, and the fact that the body had been buried several centuries before, drives them to travel such long distances to reach the site. Upon reaching the old cemetery, they notice the distant baying of a giant hound. They ignore it and begin their excavation. After a while of digging, they hit a solid object in the ground. After clearing the last of the dirt from it, the two men unearth a strange and elaborately-made coffin. Upon opening the casket, they see that several places on the skeletal remains appear torn and shattered, as if attacked by a wild animal. Yet, the whole of the skeleton is still completely distinguishable. At that moment, they notice a jade amulet hanging from the ‚Äúghoul's‚Äù neck. They examine it and, after a bit of observation, they recognize the amulet as one mentioned in ‚Äúthe forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.\\" They immediately know they must have the amulet at all cost. They remove it from the skeleton and flee into the night. As they do, they notice once again the continuous sound of a baying hound in the distance. Even as they return home, strange sounds can be heard within their house, including the distant howl of a dog. This culminates into his friend being violently attacked and killed by a mysterious creature, which the narrator claims the amulet had brought onto him. He destroys the macabre museum he and his friend made, before fleeing from the house. He decides that he must return the amulet to its rightful owner, but it's stolen from him before he can return it. The next day, he reads in the morning paper about a band of thieves dismembered by an unknown creature. Growing mad, he returns to the churchyard and exhumes the coffin once more, only to find the skeleton within covered in caked blood and bits of flesh and hair, holding the lost amulet in its hand. Suddenly, the skeleton begins howling the same type of howl that had plagued him since he left. The narrator flees the graveyard and it is then revealed that the story is a suicide note. The narrator states that he intends to kill himself with a revolver. He believes this to be his only refuge from the crawling horror which grows within him. Cthulhu Mythos \\"The Hound\\" contains several references to the body of lore known as the Cthulhu Mythos that Lovecraft shared with other horror writers. Most notably, it marks the first appearance of one of Lovecraft's most famous literary creations‚Äîthe forbidden book known as the Necronomicon. Lovecraft had mentioned its author a year earlier, in \\"The Nameless City\\", but here for the first time named the book. Referring to an amulet found on a grave-robbing expedition, the narrator relates: :Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead. The reference to \\"Leng\\" is one of the first mentions of Lovecraft's imaginary plateau, having only appeared before in 1920s \\"Celephais\\". Here placed in Central Asia, Leng is also associated in Lovecraft's writings with Antarctica and his imaginary Dreamlands. Lovecraftian scholar Will Murray, pointing to the \\"semi-canine face\\" on the amulet as well as the \\"corpse-eating cult\\" of Leng, suggests that the titular creature of \\"The Hound\\" \\"probably represents an early form of the ghoul as Lovecraft would develop it.\\"Will Murray, \\"Lovecraft's Ghouls\\", in The Horror of It All, Robert M. Price, ed., p. 41. Inspiration On September 16, 1922, Lovecraft toured the Flatbush Reformed Church in Brooklyn with his friend Rheinhart Kleiner, writing about the visit in a letter: :Around the old pile is a hoary churchyard, with dating from around 1730 to the middle of the nineteenth century.... From one of the crumbling gravestones--dated 1747--I chipped a small piece to carry away. It lies before me as I write--and ought to suggest some sort of horror-story. I must place it beneath my pillow as I sleep... who can say what thing might not come out of the centuried earth to exact vengeance for his desecrated tomb? And should it come, who can say what it might not resemble?Lovecraft, Selected Letters, Vol. I p. 98; quoted in Steven J. Mariconda, \\"'The Hound'--a Dead Dog?\\" in The Horror of It All, Robert M. Price, ed., p. 49. Lovecraft wrote \\"The Hound\\" shortly afterwards, using as the name of one of the main characters his nickname for his companion Kleinhart, \\"St. John\\".Mariconda, p. 49. The grave that is fatefully robbed in the story is in a \\"terrible Holland churchyard\\"‚Äîperhaps a reference to Flatbush church being part of the Dutch Reformed Church (although the story is actually set in the Netherlands, as well as in England). Critic Steven J. Mariconda suggests that the story is a tribute to the Decadent literary movement in general and in particular Joris-Karl Huysmans' A rebours, an 1884 novel that Lovecraft greatly admired. (Huysmans is mentioned by name in the story, along with Baudelaire.) Like \\"The Hound\\"'s protagonists, victims of a \\"devastating ennui\\", the main character of A rebours suffers from an \\"overpowering tedium\\" that leads him to \\"imagine and then indulge in unnatural love-affairs and perverse pleasures.\\"Mariconda, p. 50. Mariconda also points to the heavy debt the story owes to Edgar Allan Poe, an influence acknowledged by several borrowed phrases: :The \\"oblong box\\" exumed, the mysterious \\"knock on my chamber door\\", and the \\"red death\\" brought by the Hound all echo Poe's phraseology.Mariconda, p. 51. Reception Though Lovecraft chose \\"The Hound\\" as one of the five stories he initially submitted to Weird Tales, his main professional outlet, he later dismissed it as \\"a dead dog\\"Mariconda, p. 53. and \\"a piece of junk\\"H. P. Lovecraft, Selected Letters Vol. 3, p. 192; cited in Peter Cannon, \\"Introduction\\", More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 4. Some critics have shared Lovecraft's deprecation; Lin Carter called it \\"a minor little tale\\" that is \\"slavishly Poe-esque in style\\".Lin Carter, Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos, p. 24. But the story has its defenders; Steven J. Mariconda says it is \\"written in a zestful, almost baroque style which is very entertaining\\", while Peter Cannon, saying that it must have been written \\"with tongue at least partly in cheek\\", credits it with a certain \\"naive charm\\".Cannon, p. 4. The plot of the Poppy Z. Brite short story \\"His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood\\" bears a strong resemblance to this Lovecraft story, albeit transplanted to a modern Southern Gothic Louisiana setting.
