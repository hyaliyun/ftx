She served as the Executive Mayor of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality from 2016 until 2019. Gumede is a member of the African National Congress.  Early Life  A mother of four and a grandmother of seven, Gumede, who resides in Phoenix, was born on 12 May 1961 in Amaoti at Inanda, north of Durban. She is one of thirteen children born to Mr and Mrs Majola. Gumede attended Amaoti Primary, Okhozini Primary in Hammarsdale and JL Dube and Zwelibanzi Secondary Schools. Her father was a police officer.  Politics  Her career included being a former ward councillor, executive committee member and chairperson of the Community and Emergency Services Committee. Gumede was elected as a proportional representative (PR) councillor for two terms before she became Amaoti councillor. In the eThekwini Municipality, she was also elected as treasurer from 2007 to 2015. After 1994, Gumede worked in different community development organisations in Inanda, including the Inanda Civic Association, Inanda Development Forum, CPF and also a health organisation. Her purchases of armoured vehicles has raised concern by some critics. After nominating Mxolisi Kaunda in August 2019 as Durban's new mayor, the ruling ANC begged Gumede to resign her mayoralty. On 26 August 2019 it was reported that the ANC had received Gumede's resignation, but two days later Gumede withdrew her resignation. Her lawyers advised her to withdraw her resignation in the light of the criminal charges she is facing. On 19 August 2020, Gumede was sworn in as a Member of the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature, replacing Ricardo Mthembu, who died from COVID-19 in July. Opposition parties criticised her appointment, while Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, congratulated her.  Alleged involvement in crime  In December 2018, the Hawks, a South African criminal investigation unit, included Gumede in forensic investigations related to fraud, money laundering and corruption during her tenure, and personal involvement in alleged illegal tender awards, fake employment creation and various other matters. On 14 May 2019, Gumede appeared in the Special Commercial Crimes court in Durban for multiple crimes relating to fraud, and was released on R50 000 bail, pending further court appearances. The ANC Youth League called for Gumede to resign as mayor because the bail conditions imposed by the court would not allow her to execute her mayoral functions, while the ANC Women's League showed support for her to remain in office.Mayor Gumede gains support from eThekwini ANCWL as calls for her removal grow, News24. Retrieved on 13 August 2019. After the arrest of Gumede, the Hawks investigation officer in charge of this case, was ambushed by three gunmen and was lucky to be alive after being injured. Her term as mayor came to an end when Mxolisi Kaunda was elected as Durban's mayor on 5 September 2019. On 10 October 2019, the Hawks and members of the South African National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA) Asset Forfeiture Unit raided Gumede's Illchester Avenue home in Durban North. However, Gumede was not found there and it was discovered that she had only rented the property and vacated it in July, subsequently changing addresses - a direct violation of her bail conditions. The Hawks and the NPA then moved to Gumede's home in Inanda where they served her a court order to carry out the raids in relation to a R280 million tender scam within the Durban Solid Waste department. The raids were intended to seize R51 million in assets, including a number of luxury verhicles, including Porsches, Lamborghinis and Jaguar vehicles. Various homes, belonging to fifteen other co-accused individuals were also targeted during the raids. Footage of the raids went viral online.

It is a potent mineralocorticoid. Syntheses of 11Œ≤-OHP from progesterone is catalyzed by the steroid 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) enzyme, and, to a lesser extent, by the aldosterone synthase enzyme (CYP11B2).  Function  Along with its epimer 11Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone (11Œ±-OHP), 11Œ≤-OHP has been identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11Œ≤-HSD). Outcome of 21-hydroxylase deficiency It has been known since 1987 that increased levels of 11Œ≤-OHP occur in 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A study in 2017 has shown that in subjects with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, serum 11Œ≤-OHP concentrations range from 0.012 to 3.37 ng/mL, while in control group it was below detection limit of 0.012 ng/mL. 21-hydroxylase is an enzyme that is also involved in progesterone metabolism, producing 11-deoxycorticosterone. In normal conditions, 21-hydroxylase has higher activity on progesterone than steroid 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) that convert progesterone to 11Œ≤-OHP. That's why in 21-hydroxylase deficiency, given the normal function of the CYP11B enzymes, the progesterone is directed towards 11Œ≤-OHP pathway rather than towards 11-deoxycorticosterone pathway, that is also usually accompanied by an increase in progesterone levels. In the 2017 study above mentioned, serum progesterone concentrations in boys (10 days to 18 years old) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency reached levels similar to female luteal values (up to 10.14 ng/mL, depending on severity and treatment), while in the control group of boys progesterone was 0.07 ng/mL (0.22 nmol/L) on average, ranged from 0.05 to 0.40 ng/mL. While studies suggest that 11Œ≤-OHP, also known as 21-deoxycorticosterone, can be used as marker for adrenal 21-hydroxylase deficiency, another 21-carbon steroid ‚Äî 21-deoxycortisol (produced from 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone) gained acceptance for this purpose.

History Rinpi village is said to have been established by the five sons of Pu Ral Thang, of the Khualsim tribe. This tribe came into Simpi around 1570-1580 AD and settled at Simpi Village. The tribal chief, Pu Ral Thang, had five sons with his first wife; the eldest was Pu Hriam Ee and the youngest was Mi Ee. After his first wife's death Pu Ral Thang married a second wife, whom disliked his sons. She requested her husband that either send them away or kill them, otherwise she would divorce him. Pu Ral Thang was reluctant to harm his sons and did not know how to send them away. After two attempts to abandon his sons in the forest, from which they returned, Pu Ral Thang sadly took his five sons to the river Phauva, which, in the rainy season, is narrow and deep. It forms the boundary between Falam and the Hakha township area. At noon that day, Pu Ral Thang threw his sons into the river, but the current took them to the other side. Even though they wanted to go back home, they couldn't get back across the river and were forced to settle on the other side of the Phauva. A few months later, in spring, his sons still not having come back, Pu Ral Thang went to observe the area. He went to the other side of the Phauva River and met them there. They named that place Hmunhlipi. \\"Hmun\\" stands for \\"the place where father and sons met\\". \\"Hli\\" stands for \\"they were the sons of the first wife\\", and Pi means \\"the place they came from was Simpi\\". There is a story behind the Rinpi song \\"Hai par thing sang cung in, hrin hniang man thlau ai u, khua hlan nu ei huat cu kan rak tuar hringhran ee\\". This song refers to the hardships of being abandoned by the their step mother's cruelness. Hmunhlipi became prosperous year after year until it contained over 50 households. During this time Pu Ral Thang's eldest son Pu Hriam Ee had two sons of his own, who were named Pu Cio Kip and Pu Bawi Tiam. Pu Cio Kip inherited Pu Hriam Ee and the land of Hmunhlipi become Pu Cio Kip possession. The chieftainship also derived through Pu Cio Kip generation. There was a story that how Pu Cio Kip became the chief of the land. According to their concept at that time, the man who shot a big animal was great and honored. In order to pass the chief possession, Pu Hriam Ee asked his son to hunt animal in the deep forest. They killed the kitten of wild pig and big mouse. In size the mouse was bigger. So Pu Bawi Tiam chose big mouse for his own. Only the kitten of wild pig was left for Pu Cio Kip. But in their concept, mouse was nothing, even a women and child can catch. But for wild pig, regardless of the size, its name is greater. Only a man with arrow and spear can kill them. There is a trandition in the society, at the first mountain of the village, they shout their name to be heard by the villager that who killed what! When the time came, they shouted 'Pu Cio Kip killed the wild pig, Pu Bawi Tiam killed the mouse\\". Their father Pu Hriam Ee was impressed by Pu Cio Kip, and Pu Cio Kip inherited his father land. Cio Kip and Bawi Tiam name became clan name in further generation. Until 1956, only Pu Cio Kip clan generation could became village chief. No one from other clan could not become the village chief. When parliamentary system was introduced in Myanmar and chieftainship was abolished. From that time, other clan could serve as village chief. The decision was made at Falam in 1948 February 20, that day become \\"Chin National Day\\" in now a day. Hmunhlipi to Rimpi Due to a tribal war in Chinland territory, Hmunhlipi village was also forsaken and the Hmunhlipi people had to run for their lives. Some went to the Plain area around the Kalay valley. When the situation had become more stable, Pu Cio Kip's generation returned to find their old place again. In this year he had a son which they named \\"Zo Kaar\\", which means \\"after passing through the deep forest and through hardships from the plain, they managed to come to their home in a cold mountainous place\\". They named their new settlement as \\"Riimpi\\". The Chinland people had no literature before the British occupied the territory, so the name of the village was not written down throughout its history. In 1894, Major Newland invented \\"Lai literature based on the English alphabet\\", printed in 1897, and having over 600 pages. Subsequently, the American Baptist Missionary Authur E. Carson & Laura came to Chinland in 1899 and Chin literature was further developed. The village name was first written down by Tuck & Carey, in \\"The Chin Hill\\", Vols.1 and 2 as \\"Rimpi\\". This was the name also used by the British government.The pronunciation of \\"Riim\\" in Chin and \\"Rim\\" in English was the same. So Riimpi was written as \\"Rimpi\\". Rimpi to Rinpi Rinpi people called themselves \\"Riimpi\\" and when the British colonel rule over the land. The British government wrote their name as \\"Rimpi\\". In English pronunciation \\"Rim\\" is the same with local pronunciation \\"Riim\\". Thus, the original name \\"Riimpi\\" became \\" Rimpi \\" in written. Since the Union of Myanmar, established on February 12, 1947, Chinland become one of the state in Myanmar. Chinland was ruled by Chin Affair Council. In 1965, the president of Chin Affair Council Pu Son Khua Lian visited the village and he ordered the village headman Pu Phir Kio and his secretary Pu Kep Luai, to write the village name as \\"Rinpi\\", which is the closest approximation to its Burmese pronunciation.

It was the first Presbyterian Church built in Fremantle and one of only six to decline amalgamation with the Uniting Church. Description The church is constructed from ashlar limestone with red-brick quoins on the buttresses and window edges. The steeply pitched roof is constructed from timber originally with jarrah shingles but most recently with terra cotta tiles. When originally built the church consisted of a nave and an aisle on the north western side; the vestry is at the north-eastern end of the aisle with a connecting tower and porch at the south-western end facing Norfolk Street, which acts as the main entrance. The building style is rustic gothic, composed of stone in irregular coursed work, with red brick moulded windows and door jambs. There are moulded brick dripstones rising from plaster and terra cotta corbels. The window sills, plinths, mouldings and steps of buttresses are rendered in cement stucco. The buildings exterior is rough stone and brickwork with the brick pointed, in black and white mortar. The tower is tall with an octagonal spire. The main facade comprises the tower and spire, porch and triple lancet windows fitted with stained glass. The church now has a capacity of 80 in the main hall and 25 in the lesser hall. The church pipe organ was built in 1897 by Alfred Fuller of Kew, Victoria, and is one of the last he built before his business closed in 1900. It was delivered and installed in the church prior to 1901. The longest pipes of the organ are situated on either side of the console and in towers at floor level. There are two manual chests with no internal passage board between them. The console has an attached drawstop with a roll top, there are two composition pedals to great and two to swell. It has a mechanical key and stop action and four couplers. The organ was restored by F.J.Larner and company in 1990 with the pipes restored sometime later by Pipe Organs of Western Australia. History The Free Church of Scotland commenced services in Perth in 1849 at St. Andrew's Church in Pier Street. A congregation of the Scots Church was established in Fremantle in 1885 with services delivered by a lay preacher. Rev. Robert Hamlin arrived in 1886 and held his first service on 16 October 1887 in the Oddfellow's Hall and later in the supper room of the Fremantle Town Hall. Hanlin soon set about seeking donations, locally and in the eastern states, to build a permanent church in Fremantle. A loan of ¬£1,000 was granted by the Colonial Committee in Scotland and a local bank also advanced funds. Hanlin acquired the South Terrace site (Fremantle Town Lot 1360) for ¬£208 in June 1889 for the Commissioners of the Presbyterian Church in Western Australia from the state government. The Fremantle City Council, approved plans for Scots Presbyterian Church at a special meeting in March 1890, and on 26 March 1890 the foundation stone was laid by John Forrest. The architect for the building was Talbot Hobbs, the building contractor was Messrs. J. Petrie and Company, with internal decorative painting carried out by E. Bockelmann. The building was completed at a cost of ¬£2,000 and officially opened on 26 November 1890. Gaslight was introduced in 1902 and replaced with electric light in 1905. The church was re-roofed at a cost of ¬£150 in 1911, and in 1975 the Church was awarded a 15,000 National Estate grant for repairs to brickwork and wiring. In 1985 a wall around the church was constructed, with a rear shed added on in 1994.

It is a creative interpretation of lord Guruvayurappan. The word Maraprabhu means the ‚Äòlord of tree‚Äô. The statue was inaugurated by K. Karunakaran, the popular Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Kerala on 24 June 1995, his 77th birthday (according to Malayalam customs). The chief architect of this idol is the artist P.V. Ramachandran.  Myth  Melpathur and Poonthanam were contemporary scholars and both were devotees of Guruvayurappan. The writing styles of Melpathur and Poonthanam were different. Melpathur used Sanskrit and at the same time Poonthanam used Malayalam. Once at a Sahasranamam recital Poonthanam wrongly recited ‚Äô Padmanabha Amaraparbhu‚Äô as ‚ÄòPadmanabha Maraprabhu' which means God of trees. Melpathur insulted Poonthanam by openly laughing out at him. Poonthanam‚Äôs compositions were brimmed with devotion and he was humble. The myth goes like this. Guruvayurappan himself came to the aid of his devotee and intervened as a celestial voice that ‚Äò I am also Maraprabhu‚Äò to save him from insult.  Features  The sculptor P.V. Ramachandran is the one who is behind the construction of terracotta sculpture which is 52 feet tall. Thousands of artists labored hard for the construction of Guruvayur Maraprabhu. It was inaugurated by former Kerala Chief Minister, K. Karunakaran, who was the then Industrial Minister, Government of India.  Significance  Maraprabhu is the symbol of cure with the help of herbs. Trees and Herbs are the ultimate source of medicines and it can cure ailments and can save the life. The Maraprabhu idol is said to generate immense cosmic energy because of the medicinal herbs used in its construction.

This game was Homebrew Software's first software product. The game consists of three episodes (of 12 levels each), the first available as shareware. Plot The space explorer Captain Buzz Klondike travels in his artificially intelligent ship Stella, who stumbles on an asteroid with some valuable mineral deposits. But as Klondike ventures deeper into the asteroid, he realises the asteroid was sent from the planet of Gateworld, where trouble runs amok. Gameplay Each episode is divided into three acts. Each act has three normal levels and a boss level. The player's goal is to get Klondike through the levels, by finding the gate teleporter key and accessing the gate teleporter to proceed. Bosses in boss levels are indestructible, so the player must avoid them. To finish the final boss level of an episode, the player must destroy the base machine to get the final gate teleporter key. Klondike is able to fire his weapon straight or diagonally up or down. Some enemies are harmless, but obstructive while others cause Klondike damage on impact or with projectiles. Traps are also present throughout the levels. Canisters can be picked up for health, stars can be picked up for powerups (or the occasional harmful stars) and guns can be picked up for ammunition. Development The game was under development by Apogee Software in 1991. However, the quality of the game was deemed poor and the project was cancelled in 1992, then replaced with Major Stryker. Homebrew Software took over where the game left off. Homebrew planned to port the game to Windows by 2001, but the port was never released.

He is professor in history of art at the University of Malta and was for 25 years head of the History of Art Department, which he founded.  Career  He introduced history of art as an academic discipline at the University of Malta in 1988 and saw it grow into a fully fledged department which he directed for several years producing in the process a cohort of art historians who now occupy the key posts of Malta's heritage and cultural institutions. On the attainment of his first degree from the University of London, he was first attached to the Maltese National Museums Department where, with the support of the Council for Cultural Cooperation of the Council of Europe, he pioneered the drawing up of a Protective Inventory of the Maltese Cultural Heritage. He also served as president and vice-president of the Malta Historical Society. In 1968 he was founder with George Serracino-Inglott of the Youth Section of Din L-Art Helwa and was responsible for the discovery of and initial rehabilitation programme of the Late Medieval Church of the Annunciation at Hal Millieri. He is also past president of the Malta Historical Society. Prof. Buhagiar is the author of specialised books and studies on art and archaeology, and he has read papers on art historical and related topics in various international seminars and been guest lecturer in several universities and Fine Arts Institutions in Europe. His areas of specialisation are Maltese Early Christian Art and Archaeology, Medieval Art and Antiquaries, and the Art and Architecture of the Knights of St John. His art historical and archaeological studies have established the European context for Maltese art history and medieval archaeology and has provided scholars with the essential framework for the future development of research on the subject. He is together with Dr Charlene Vella studying Renaissance paintings in Malta and finding funds together in order to conserve and restore these paintings. They started by studying a painting of the Madonna adoring the Child in Zejtun attributed to Antonio de Saliba in 2011 and proceeded with two paintings by Antonio de Saliba dated to 1510‚Äì15 in the Franciscan Observant church of Santa Maria de Ges√π in Rabat, Malta, portraying the Madonna and Child with Angels and the Deposition from the Cross between 2013 and 2014.

They are known for mixing different styles of extreme music, continuously experimenting with compositions, melodics and sound. Biography Vorva≈à was formed by guitarist Eugene Cherevkov who had left his previous band Tombstone Piledriver and started the new project in 2009 in Moscow with an idea of playing fast mix of metal and punk. After a long process of trying different musicians Eugene's old mate Igor Butz joined him as a bassist in early 2011. Later that year drummer Aleksandr Fursov and vocalist Eli Mavrychev completed the band's line up. In February 2012 Vorva≈à released their debut EP \\"Sailing the Vastness of Oceans\\" via Gorgona Records limited to only 500 CD copies. As expected, it was influenced by Converge, Disfear and Mastodon. After the \\"Sailing the Vastness of Oceans\\" release Aleksandr left the band and new drummer Alexey Merganov joined Vorva≈à. Fresh line up went on in November 2012 and went on the CIS tour by the end of year. During 2013 Vorva≈à were actively playing local shows, sharing stage with such bands as Napalm Death, Extreme Noise Terror. In October the band releases a digital EP In Gloom consisting of four new songs where they presented much more aggressive and solid sound. Their music became even more experimental and chaotic. Next year Vorva≈à opened their new recording studio, went on their first headlining European tour. Later Zakk Hemma replaced Alexey Merganov as a drummer and Vorva≈à focused on writing a material for the new full-length album, rarely playing shows with Converge, Kylesa, Architects. Whole 2015 was spent on new material and experiments with recording and finally Vorva≈à finished working on their first longplay album Once Love Was Lost which was mixed and mastered by American producers Kurt Ballou (Converge) and Brad Boatright (From Ashes Rise). In September 2016 Vorva≈à premiered the new song \\"The Black Kaleidoscope\\" featuring guest vocals of Armin Schweiger (Afgrund/Distaste) and quickly followed with their new official music video release on the song \\"When Serpent Strikes First\\". On October 5, new song \\"Sirens\\" became exclusively available for digital streaming that made the upcoming album highly anticipated worldwide. This song features guest appearance of Meghan O'Neil known as a vocalist for San Francisco-based Punch and Super Unison. Once Love Was Lost was officially released via German labels Wooaaargh and Darkened Days Records on double coloured vinyls. This press includes a 32-page booklet with the artwork done by Rotting Graphics and exclusively features Vorva≈à's cover on the song \\"Struck a Nerve\\" originally performed by Machine Head. By the end of year the band went on short Russian tour. In an interview with Metal Hammer, vocalist Eli Mavrychev has revealed Vorva≈à's plans to tour Europe and the UK in 2017.

Born in Glasgow, Bowman was privately educated at the High School of Glasgow and George Watson's College. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1973 and received accreditation as a chartered accountant in 1976. He subsequently joined accounting firm Peat Marwick, the predecessor of KPMG, working successively in their Edinburgh and Aberdeen offices until 2001. Having secured promotion as Deputy Senior Partner, Bowman moved to Bucharest in 2002, where he engaged with KPMG's operations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with a particular focus on Romania and Moldova. Leaving KPMG, Bowman returned to the United Kingdom in 2013. He was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Dundee East constituency at the 2015 general election, as well as the area's equivalent seat for the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election, but finished third on both occasions. After the death of Conservative colleague Alex Johnstone in December 2016, Bowman was selected to replace him as an MSP for North East Scotland, having been positioned next on the regional list. Since his accession, he has become the Scottish Conservatives' Spokesperson for Taxation. Bowman has become well known for both his financial interests as well as his membership of various parliamentary committees and groupings. Early life and career William Archibald Bowman was born in Glasgow on 30 May 1950. He was educated at the independent High School of Glasgow and Edinburgh's George Watson's College, the latter from 1961 until 1968. Bowman then went up to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) in 1973. After accreditation by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS), Bowman qualified as a chartered accountant in 1976. In the same year, he joined the Edinburgh section of Peat Marwick, the predecessor of KPMG, before establishing himself as an early member of the firm's Aberdeen branch in 1981, becoming a partner in 1985. There he remained until 2001, concurrently serving as a director of Aberdeen-based Target Energy Group Ltd between June and September 2000, before moving to Bucharest in 2002. Bowman took up a role as Deputy Senior Partner of KPMG's operations in Romania and Moldova, as well as the wider Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, serving on the Supervisory Committee of the latter. Specialising in risk management and ethics, Bowman also served as an elected board member of the Chamber of Financial Auditors of Romania, United Way Romania and the Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce. During this time, he was quoted regularly in the national media, most frequently in Wall-street.ro, an online business publication in Romania. Leaving KPMG in 2012, Bowman joined the board of Bucharest's UTI Holdings in October of the same year, serving until April 2013. In a declaration of financial interests, he is listed as a shareholder in a wide range of companies, most substantially in Glasgow-based quality assurance firm Tenairvia Consulting Ltd, dissolved in November 2017, for which he owned 100% of shares. Other investments have included stakes in equity firms Simmons Private Equity, Vanguard S&P; and Concept Fund Solutions PLC, investment fund Guttmann Investor, oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell, media organisation ITV, consumer goods producer Unilever and British American Tobacco. Bowman's personal portfolio was quoted by The Courier & Advertiser in September 2018 as \\"worth more than ¬£600,000\\". Political career Bowman on the day of his accession to the Scottish Parliament, 21 December 2016 Bowman returned to the United Kingdom later in 2013, settling in Fife. He \\"took up an active interest in politics\\" shortly afterwards and was subsequently selected as the Conservative Party candidate for the Dundee East constituency in August 2014 to fight the upcoming general election of the following year. Finishing third, behind incumbent Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) Stewart Hosie and Labour's Lesley Brennan, later briefly a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), Bowman captured 7,206 ballots, 15% of the total cast, a small reduction of 0.2% compared with the previous Conservative's vote share. In a contemporary interview with the Financial Times, citing the predicted success of the SNP, Bowman stated: \\"A lot of people I know are very concerned about the move to the left. The SNP is trying to out-Labour Labour, and Labour is trying to out-Labour itself\\". A month later, in June 2015, he was selected to fight the equivalent Scottish Parliament constituency of Dundee City East for the Scottish Conservatives. Despite increasing the party's vote share by 7.6% with 4,969 ballots, Bowman again finished third in the 2016 contest, behind incumbent MSP Shona Robison of the SNP and Labour's Richard McCready. His campaign predominantly advertised job creation, investment in public amenities and a commitment to advocate for the decentralisation of Police Scotland. As of September 2018, he is a permanent resident of the city. Upon the death of Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone in December 2016, Bowman was selected to replace him as a representative for North East Scotland, having been positioned next on the regional list. He was sworn in as an MSP on 21 December by taking his Oath of Allegiance in the chamber of the Scottish Parliament. Having joined the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Committee, Bowman soon came under scrutiny by opposition politicians for selling nearly ¬£30,000 worth of British American Tobacco shares on 12 January 2017, with Labour speculating whether he had done so on Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson's recommendation, perhaps in order to avoid public concern over vested interests. Retorting, the Conservative group highlighted that \\"[Bowman] has declared his shareholdings openly and in line with procedure, as have many other MSPs.\\" Otherwise unusual for MSPs, he does not claim public funds to maintain a second abode in Edinburgh, the location of the Scottish Parliament, owing to his constituency's relative proximity to the legislature; that said, Bowman attracted further criticism after lodging ¬£1,601 and ¬£13,483 in dining and hotel accommodation expenses, respectively, dating from his accession to September 2018. =Parliamentary duties= Bowman has served as a member of the parliamentary Public Audit and Post-legislative Scrutiny Committee, as well as a substitute member of the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee. These duties are combined with his position as the Scottish Conservatives' Spokesperson for Taxation, a duty he has exercised since 28 June 2017. In this capacity, a parliamentary question tabled by Bowman to the Scottish Government in June 2018 first revealed that national business rates were taxing firms ¬£200m more than those operating under English regulations. Bowman is also a constituent of the Cross-Party parliamentary groups on Building Bridges with Israel, Culture, and Scotch Whisky, further serving as Deputy Chair of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.

The beginning of the revolution In 1892, the Government of J√∫lio Prates de Castilhos entered a phase of instability. With the state of Rio Grande do Sul at a boiling point, the Federalist Revolution was starting, with rebel troops being led by the general Jo√£o Nunes da Silva Tavares, known as Joca Tavares. Gumercindo decided to flee towards Uruguay, where the rebel troops were being assembled, after having refused to join the loyalist troops. On February 2, 1893, accompanied by his brother Aparicio Saravia and leading about 400 mounted troops, he crossed the border in a town called Serrilhada, entering Rio Grande do Sul and joining the men of General Jo√£o Nunes da Silva Tavares, thus forming the Liberator Army, a contingent of more than 3000 men. Shortly, newcomers inflated the number of rebel troops to 12 000. Reportedly a third brother, Mariano, also took part in this revolution. In Uruguay, the three brothers Saraiva were known as the three of Cerro Largo. On April 4, 1893, the first battle against loyalist troops occurs. After several skirmishes with Government forces, realizing his disadvantage, Gumercindo Saraiva resorted to guerrilla tactics, with moderate success. The Maragatos go north Gumercindo Saraiva and his troops headed for Dom Pedrito. From there began a series of lightning attacks against various parts of the State, destabilizing the positions conquered by loyalists. Then headed north, advancing in November about Santa Catarina and Paran√°, with detainees arriving at the city of Lapa, 60 kilometers southwest of Curitiba. On this occasion, Colonel Garcia Carneiro died in February 1894 without handing their position to the enemy, in the episode which became known as the Siege of Lapa. Admiral Cust√≥dio de Melo, to heading up the Armed uprising against Floriano Peixoto, joined the federalists and occupied Desterro, current Florian√≥polis. From there came to Curitiba, the warlord- Gumercindo Saraiva maragato. Lapa resistance prevented the advancement of the rebels. Gumercindo, unable to advance, retreated to Rio Grande do Sul. He died on August 10, 1894, after being hit by a bullet while recognizing the terrain on the eve of the battle of Carovi. Back to the pampas After the fall of Lapa, he headed to Curitiba, finding it completely unguarded. He then left to Ponta Grossa, where he faced legal troops who had received reinforcements from S√£o Paulo, forcing him to retreat, beginning the withdrawal and return to Rio Grande do Sul, now beset by government troops. In March by three States, since his departure from Jaguar√£o until the return to the South, General Gumercindo Saraiva and his troops traveled on horseback, a route of more than 3,000 km. On June 27, 1894 faced his last great battle. On 10 August day died from a gunshot wound to the chest, of stalking, before starting the battle of Carovi, the place became known as Capon of the battle, in the area today in the municipality of Cap√£o do Cip√≥. In a war of atrocities on both sides, two days after he buried in the cemetery, St. Anthony of Capuchins, current municipality of Itacurubi, his body was removed from the grave, got his head cut off and taken in a hatbox to Governor J√∫lio de Castilhos. His body was later taken and buried in the municipal cemetery of Santa Vit√≥ria do Palmar, without the head [1]. The consequences of the withdrawal of Gumercindo When the arrival of the troops of Gumercindo Sambrano to Exile (now Florian√≥polis) and Curitiba, florianistas troops left the towns desguarnecidas, abandoned their defences and retreated, leaving only a few soldiers in the rear and the population abandoned to fend for themselves. In both cities, the political elite, merchants and industrialists, resolved, to avoid looting, killings and rapes, make a deal with Gumercindo Saraiva, in this, the troops of the Maragatos, would respect an agreement of non-violence and in Exchange the population would pay a tribute to war. The agreement was established and the population was spared. But the federalists, after successive battles and acts of heroism and bravery that enrolling in the annals of history, are defeated and, with the return of the troops was made legal a bloody \\"reckoning\\". In Curitiba, on the imminence of the attack, the people turned to Baron Saw blue (Ildefonso Pereira Correia), because no other leader inspired confidence. The Government was no brainer. Formed a governing Junta of Commerce, under the leadership of Serro Azul, able to contain the excesses of a city despoliciada and dazed. Created the loan of war and were the Gumercindo Sami negotiate the invasion of Curitiba. The same happened in Exile, where the Baron of Batovi (Manoel de Almeida Coelho da Gama Lobo d ' E√ßa) presided over a tumultuous and historic meeting held on 29 September 1893, during which we opted for capitulation against the ships of the Armada, mutineers against the Vice-President of the Republic, the Office of President, Floriano Peixoto. Batovi didn't do but to surrender to the aspirations of the inhabitants of Desterro terrified and suddenly involved in such spectacular events. And, the hitherto quiet Curitiba and Exile, you become part of a blacklist of Floriano Peixoto. In defense of the Government of the Republic, Marshal Floriano names and send to Santa Catarina, the Fiery Lieutenant Colonel of infantry of the army. Ant√¥nio Moreira C√©sar, name the story celebrates the nicknames of Cuts. At the same time troops of Colonel Pires Ferreira occupy Curitiba, abandoned by insurgents and the Commander of the military district, general Talal, imposed martial law. In Paran√°, dozens of people, including civilians and soldiers were executed summarily, in Santa Catarina that number rose to about 300 people. Historical recognition The Government war propaganda accused him of atrocities, which was disproved by hundreds of witnesses, including their political enemies. Because in cases of abuses committed by their subordinates, punished in an exemplary manner, as it was with soldier Diniz. In a research study at the school of command and staff of the Army (ECEME), was considered the greatest combat leader of this revolution. Bibliography *GOYCOCHEA, Luiz Felipe Castilhos.

Plot The first novella of the anthology ‚Äì \\"Anna on the Neck\\" ‚Äì is the story of Anna Petrovna (Maria Strelkova), who has at a young age become the wife of middle- aged venerable official Modest Alexeyevich (Michael Tarhanov). By marrying, the heroine hopes to be able to financially support her father and brothers, but soon learns that her virtuous spouse does not want to help the drunken relative and his sons. Life in the house of her husband seems dull and monotonous to Anna. The situation changes after a charity ball, where the wife of Modest Alexeyevich causes a sensation. Anna eagerly accepts courtship of the governor, and the wealthy landowner Artynov. At the end of the novella the young woman rides with a suitor in a carriage by her father's house, not realizing that furniture is being removed from the house. The second part of the anthology ‚Äì \\"Death of a Government Clerk\\" ‚Äì is an episode from the life of a county court bailiff Chervyakov (Ivan Moskvin), who, when sneezing during a theatrical performance sprays General Bryzgalov (Vladimir Ershov), who is sitting in front of him. He apologizes to the \\"victim\\" during the play and then in the intermission, Chervyakov is upset all night because of the embarrassment which has occurred. In the morning he goes to meet Bryzgalov to ask for forgiveness again. The general's words ‚Äì \\"What nonsense ... I've already forgotten\\" (individual lines of the characters are reproduced in the intertitles) do not reduce the suffering of the clerk. After another attempt to explain the indeliberate nature of his act, Chervyakov hears: \\"Beat it!\\". Returning home, he lies down on the sofa and dies. The action of the third story ‚Äì \\"Chameleon\\" takes place in summer on the market. After drinking vodka, artisan Khriukin (Vladimir Popov) tries to play with a small dog. The game ends with him getting his finger bit. The commotion raised by the victim, makes the police inspector Ochumelov and policeman Eldyrin, who happen to be strolling through the area, to start looking for the dog's owner. Attitude to it ranges from anger to tenderness which varies depending on the assumptions heard in the crowd regarding the identity of the owner. After a report that the dog belongs to the brother of General Zhigalov, Ochumelov declares the artisan as the guilty party. Production Protazanov, according to film critic Nikolai Lebedev, respectfully treated Chekhov's work. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of the death of Anton Pavlovich, administration of the studio Mezhrabpomfilm offered the film director to adapt several short-stories of the writer; he was granted the right to choose the works himself. The short stories which were included into the anthology were united by the theme of Russian servility and readiness to obey superiors and to recognize any person invested with power as the supreme authority. Common motifs present in three different stories, gave the name of the picture ‚Äì \\"Ranks and People\\". As an epigraph, creators of the film used a phrase from the notebooks of Chekhov: \\"Russia ‚Äì land of the bureaucrat\\". When working on the script, Yakov Protazanov and Oleg Leonidov took into account that the author's tone, artistic details and lines of Chekhov's characters can not be transferred to film using silent film technology: Artistic qualities According to film critic Sergei Lavrentyev, the three novellas included in the anthology exhibit a cluster of fundamental directorial techniques used in cinematic interpretation of literary works. Accordingly, \\"Anna on the Neck\\" uses textbook methods of silent film in which the character of the heroine of is created by highlighting small details, and the system of relationships between the characters is revealed with the help of repeated minutiae (slippers which are constantly worn by the husband; eternal detachment in Anna Petrovna's eyes during conversations with Modest Alexeyevich). Film historian Neya Zorkaya when analyzing Protazanov's creation, noted that in the first novella of the film one of the means of expression is \\"montage featuring a series of isolated individuals\\": The camera pulls out from a crowd of people to the dazed bride at the time of the wedding, then to the confused brothers, and then to the father holding a glass of vodka. Ivan Moskvin played two roles in the film; Chervyakov and Ochumelov. In the story \\"The Death of a Government Clerk\\", much of which was shot in the realistic tradition, in the finale the director suddenly uses elements of fantasy ‚Äì they are found in the episode when the General towering over from the colossal table looks down at the small huddled officer; Bryzgalov at this point resembles a giant, Chervyakov (whose imagination spawns the vision) ‚Äì a \\"bug\\". Film critic Sergey Lavrentyev on the contrary highlights the beginning of \\"Chameleon\\": an image of a provincial town wearied from the heat with sleepy inhabitants and a slow rhythm of life largely explains the behavior of artisan Khryukin, who selects a small dog as an object of entertainment. But the scenes with the search for the owner and the inspector Ochumelov whose mood changes by the minute are less cinematic and more theatrical: Cast =Anna on the Neck= *Mikhail Tarkhanov as Modest Alekseievitch *Mariya Strelkova as Anna Petrovna *Andrey Petrovsky as Governor *N.

It is located on Westmoreland Road, to the south of the town centre. History =Beginnings= Interior In the 1880s there was already a worshipping congregation in the Bromley South area, and there had been talk for some years of building a local church. In 1884, the then vicar of St Peter and St Paul, Bromley, Reverend A. G. Hellicar, had received the gift from Samuel Cawston, a local man, of an iron church with furniture and fittings. This church formerly stood at Addison Road, Bromley Common. It was re-erected in what is now St Mark's Road, Masons Hill, on a site kindly lent by Eley Soames, and served as a place of worship until 1898. In 1891 the Bromley Record wrote, ‚ÄòIt is possible that a fund will be started to replace the iron structure in which the congregation of St Mark‚Äôs has been worshipping for the past five years‚Äô. In 1897 the decision was made. The site at the foot of Westmorland Road was purchased by Thomas Dewey and Eley Soames for ¬£500. In 1896 a meeting was held at South Hill Wood, Mr Dewey's house in Westmorland Road, when the plans of the architect, Evelyn Hellicar, son of the Vicar of Bromley, were approved. On Saturday 22 October 1898 the new church was consecrated by Dr William Walsh, Suffragan Bishop of Dover, accompanied by Canon Murray, the Rural Dean, as Chaplain, and Sir John Hassard, KCB, Registrar of the Diocese of Canterbury. On the Sunday evening the church was so crowded that many worshippers could not gain admittance. Only the bottom part of the tower was built originally, housing the main porch. The tower was raised to its full height in 1903, and dedicated on 10 January 1904. It was built of brick, faced with red bricks from Dunton Green, and decorated with Doulting stone from Shepton Mallet in Somerset. =Damage in the Second World War= On Wednesday 16 April 1941, Bromley suffered a violent air raid attack. This started in the evening and went on into the early hours. A local report says: Some of the salvaged articles were taken to St Mark's Church Hall. The reredos was protected by tarpaulins. Only the tower was left undamaged. =Rebuilding= The foundation stone An annual service was held the bombed church, witnessing the intention to rebuild. Meanwhile, reconstruction was rapid. The new church was designed by T. W. G. Grant and built by David Nye and Partners. The original foundations were reused, preserving the previous dimensions and shape, and the nave arcades were incorporated into the new structure. The lower part of the chancel arch was also saved, along with the Victorian carved capitals, the choir stalls and sedilia. On 3 June 1952 H. R. H. The Duchess of Kent laid the corner stone for the reconstruction, and in 1953 St Mark's was rededicated by the Bishop of Rochester, Dr Christopher Chavasse, in presence of the Vicar, Reverend H. J. A. Edwards. The church today The present church incorporates the original tower and much of the brick and fragments of the late Victorian building. The interior is a mixture of styles, with the parabolic arches favoured by Grant contrasting uneasily with the Perpendicular shapes of Hellicar. The reredos and choir stalls survive from before the war; the original baptismal font was accidentally broken during the war and the present one is a 1950s replacement, as are the pipe organ (designed by Rushworth and Dreaper) and lectern.

Plot Head of \\"BORE\\" (Bush Oversight of Resort Establishments), Semyon Danilovich Petukhov is the consummate bureaucrat. With the institution entrusted to him, every action must be confirmed by some official certificate, sometimes by several. Not only the visitors, but also the workers of \\"BORE\\" literally drown in unnecessary and meaningless pieces of paper, which slows down all sorts of tasks. Pyotr Petrovich Ficusov, Petukhov's stand-in, strongly supports his boss in his unbridled bureaucratic impulses. Soon Petukhov sets out to leave for a few days to go to his bride, but the unlucky groom is robbed by a pickpocket at a station, who in turn immediately falls under the wheels of a car. Police and medics arrive to inspect the corpse, find Petukhov's name in the documents and officially declare him dead. Having received the sad news, Ficusov, who is entrusted to temporarily perform director's duties, expands intense activities related to the upcoming funeral. Heartfelt obituaries are written, telegrams of condolences from other organizations are received, wall newspapers are drawn, an orchestra is arranged ... And at this time the unsuspecting Petukhov returns to \\"BORE\\" in a good mood. When entering his office he almost faints: Petukhov sees his own portrait adorned with a black frame! He is officially dead! True to his bureaucratic training, Petukhov does not allow his death certificate to be destroyed, which has become unnecessary, instead he decides to get a certificate of being alive. Doctors take Petukhov for a madman when he comes to the hospital with such an unusual inquiry. As a result, Petukhov is in a closed bureaucratic loop of his own creation. Even faithful Ficusov is unable to help his director, since Petukhov does not have the \\"correct\\" authorizing document. The situation is saved by a policeman who simply tears up Petukhov's certificate of death. Bride of Petukhov leaves him, he is removed from the director's post, and his establishment is closed. In place of \\"BORE\\" (and similar bureaucratic organizations which nested in the building) a hotel is opened and Petukhov, now working as a tour guide, shows it to the tourists as a local landmark.

Early life He was the son of John Baron and Dorothy Crumpler. He was born in Nottingham. He attended a boys' grammar school (Carlton Bolling College since 1977) in the south-east of Bradford, then in the West Riding. From the University of Leeds he gained a BSc in Physics 1941 and an MSc in 1947. Career =Royal Radar Establishment= At the RRE he did research on microwaves, which led to him becoming a division leader on guided weapons. Rapier missile in 2001 =Royal Aircraft Establishment= At the RAE he became Head of the Guided Weapons Assessment Research Group in 1966. He later became Head of Avionics in 1970, then Flight Systems in 1974. =Rapier missile= From 1958 he had worked with Cambridge-educated John Twinn in developing an affordable guided missile that could knock out low-flying aircraft. The Army was more interested in artillery with proximity fuses. The cost of providing a missile with radar guidance was an expensive solution. The solution was to employ a Command to Line of Sight Guidance System (CLOS), whereby the missile contained no radar. The missile system had a system that optically tracked the aircraft and missile. It was given to BAC who developed it further as the Rapier missile; it entered service in 1971. Personal life He married Margaret Whalley in 1942 in Bradford; they had a son (born 1944) and daughter (born 1943). He lived in Upton-upon-Severn. He married Anita Hale in 1961 in Worcester; he had a step- son. In his later life he lived in Farnham, Surrey. He died at the age of 66.

It is dedicated to Saint Mark, and is situated near the top of St Mark's Hill, near the junction with Church Hill Road. History Saint Mark's is the oldest church in Surbiton, dating back to 1845. During the course of the 19th century, it was extended, and the spire added towards the end of the century. St Mark's suffered severe bomb damage during the London Blitz of 1940. Its spire survived but the roof and much of the chancel was destroyed, and the graves in the churchyard scattered. The church was closed for two decades before being reopened in 1960, after major restoration work. During this time a temporary church hall with a tin roof was used for worship. In September 2010 the church was closed for restoration again, during which the congregation worshipped at Saint Andrew's. Saint Mark's reopened its doors once more on 24 June 2012. During the restoration, a new hall was installed and the pews replaced by seats. The church has two books of remembrance scribed by the calligrapher, Mildred Ratcliffe. Building Saint Mark's has a light airy interior, with a traditional layout of chancel and nave, and also a Lady chapel. The church is oriented in the traditional way, with the high altar at the east end. The main entrance is through the south porch and door. The tower, spire and north wall were the only surviving parts of the original church which survived the bombing, although the tower has since had to be repaired. They are thus the only places where the work of the Victorian masons and stone carvers can be seen. Most of the gravestones have been removed from the churchyard, as they were broken and damaged, but some interesting monuments remain.

It is dedicated to Saint Raphael and located on Portsmouth Road. It is Grade II* listed. History It was designed by the eminent architect Charles Parker in an Italianate style, with early Christian and Renaissance influences. The entire cost was met by Alexander Raphael, a Catholic Armenian whose family came from India. He became the first Roman Catholic to be elected Sheriff of London after the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act in 1829. Raphael built the Church in 1846 as a family chapel and named it after St Raphael. It was completed in 1848. But soon after, in November 1850, he died. His nephew, Edward, inherited the property and opened it to the public as the first Roman Catholic church in Kingston. Through successive bequests, the Church and land became the property of Captain Hon. George Savile, brother to the Sixth Earl of Mexborough, a Yorkshire family. Lady Anne Savile, daughter of the fourth Earl, lived nearby in Thames Ditton and a plaque is to be seen inside the Church commemorating her death. Unlike many other members of the Savile family buried in the vault under the High Altar, she has no known grave. The church was sold to the Diocese of Southwark after the Second World War and is now on the Registered List of Buildings of historical and architectural interest.. The church was officially consecrated on St Raphael's Day (28 September) 2012.

She is credited with fighting seven wars between the ages of fifteen and twenty. Early life Rauteli was born in the latter half of the 17th century. She is probably the only female warrior in the world who fought seven wars, starting at age fifteen. She was one of the three children of Bhoop Singh (Gorla) Rawat. The others were her brothers Bhagtu and Pathwa. At age fifteen, her engagement was finalized with Bhuppa Singh Negi from Ida talla village (Near Srikotkhal) in Pauri Garhwal district. In those days, Katyuri warriors of Kumaon were continuously attacking the Garhwal Kingdom. Life as a warrior After a few days the annual kauthig (country fair) was organised in Kanda, Rauteli wished to attend. She was unyielding in her demand. Her mother, devastated by the loss of her husband and sons, stated... > \\"O Teelu! What are you! Don‚Äôt you miss your brothers? Who will avenge your > father's death? If you want to go somewhere, it should be battlefield‚Ä¶. Can > you go? Can you avenge‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..? Enjoy your Kauthig after that!\\" This taunt from her mother left an indelible mark on Rauteli's mind, and she pushed aside her wish to go to Kauthig. Instead she began to prepare a battalion with her friends, and she regrouped the army. After some time she departed for the battlefield, riding her horse \\"Binduli\\", and accompanied by her friends \\"Bellu\\" and \\"Devali.\\"  Battle of Khairagarh, Umtagarhi, Sald Mahadev and Kalinkahkal  According to local folk tales the Khairagarh (‡§ñ‡•à‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó‡§¢‡§º) [present day Kalagarh (‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡§¢‡§º)] was her first exploit, where she overwhelmed the Katyuris of Kumaon. Then she attacked Umtagarhi (‡§â‡§Æ‡§ü‡§æ‡§ó‡§¢‡§º‡•Ä), and after that she marched her army to Sald Mahadev (‡§∏‡§≤‡•ç‡§° ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ), freeing it from the enemy. After settling the border line up to Chaukhutiya (‡§ö‡•å‡§ñ‡•Å‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ), Rauteli returned to Deghat (‡§¶‡•á‡§ò‡§æ‡§ü) with her army. In Kalinkakhal (‡§ï‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§≤) she fought the enemy and avenged her father's death by defeating the general of Katyuri army in Saraikhet (‡§∏‡§∞‡§æ‡§à‡§ñ‡•á‡§§), where her father had lost his life. Her comrade \\"Binduli (‡§¨‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§≤‡•Ä)\\" died after receiving lethal wounds there. Supreme sacrifice After winning her territories back, she started marching towards Kanda.

She was convicted of manslaughter and deported to Australia. An appeal of her conviction, seeking to return her to Canada for a retrial, was scheduled, but she committed suicide before this could happen. Early life Allyson Meagher was born sometime in November 1978 and originated from Gosford, New South Wales. She testified in a later court hearing that her father had sexual intercourse with her when she was 15 and that this led to a miscarried pregnancy; she did not previously report this incident. According to her account, her parents divorced when her sister stated that her father had sexual intercourse with her. Throughout her life she had engaged in suicide attempts and experienced miscarriages. Marriage with Curtis McConnell In 2006 she met Curtis McConnell at the Delta Ski Resort in Kamloops, British Columbia; both were employed by the resort and she was on a working holiday. She married him in January 2007 while the two were in Australia. In July of that year Connor McConnell was born while they were in that country. The couple later purchased a house in Millet. Their second child, Jayden, was born in March 2009; at that time Allyson McConnell had started a job in Leduc, Alberta. She later stated in court that she did not plan to have a second child. Allyson McConnell worked for an oil company while her husband worked in a hardware store. Their marriage encountered problems in the fall of 2009. Curtis McConnell began living in the house's basement. Allyson became upset and depressed as her marriage unraveled. Curtis filed for divorce in December of that year and moved into his parents' house. At first Allyson McConnell had an amicable relationship with her ex-husband's mother, but then she ended contact with her. The ex-husband and ex-wife entered in a custody dispute; she wanted the children in Australia while he wanted them to remain in Canada. A judge had ruled that the children should remain in Canada. Murder Allyson McConnell, 33 at the time, drowned both of her children in a bathtub. Connor was two and a half years old and Jayden was ten months old. It is not known when the children were killed. She then drove to Edmonton and, after having a meal, jumped from an overpass, and landed on a road. She had multiple broken bones. On February 1, 2010, a police officer in Edmonton called Curtis McConnell, informing him of his wife's injury. The officer was not aware of the location and status of the children. Curtis McConnell returned to the house to check on the welfare of the children and used a knife to open the locked bathroom door. He discovered the children's bodies floating in the bathtub and a wedding ring on the toilet seat. Curtis McConnell later, citing the placement of the wedding ring, expressed his belief that Allyson McConnell killed the children as a form of revenge against him, stating he initially did not believe this but later re-evaluated his understanding of the case. Aftermath, legal outcome and death Allyson McConnell survived her suicide attempt and was placed in the hospital; she said she had no memory of the incident after waking up. After hospitalization was over, she was moved to psychiatric care at Alberta Hospital Edmonton. She served fifteen months there. The boys' funeral was held five days after the discovery of their bodies. Family members on both sides were mentioned, but the mother was not. Crown Prosecutor Gordon Hatch tried the case. McConnell was convicted of manslaughter in 2012. Justice Michelle Crighton stated that McConnell did not have sufficient intent for a murder charge; this was given on the grounds that she did not remember the crime and was depressed. McConnell was originally sentenced to six years of prison, but this was later changed to sentenced to 15 months of confinement; she was eligible for release due to the time she spent at the psychiatric hospital. She was scheduled for deportation to Australia. The Alberta government unsuccessfully tried to block her deportation. Alberta Minister of Justice Jonathan Denis criticized the sentence, saying it was too light, and stated that he would take efforts to have McConnell brought back to Canada for another trial. Updated November 18, 2013 Hatch stated that he planned to file an appeal and that the McConnell family was not satisfied with the decision. Curtis McConnell also filed a civil suit against Allyson McConnell for $940,000 Canadian dollars ($903,000 Australian dollars). After her conviction, McConnell was deported to Australia on April 10, 2013, arriving at Kingsford Smith International Airport. At the time prosecutors in Canada were still attempting to succeed in their appeal and have McConnell returned to Canada to face harsher penalties. The appeal hearing was scheduled for October 30 of that year. In September 2013 a person found Allyson McConnell's body under the Brian McGowan Bridge in West Gosford, New South Wales, Australia. Her lawyer, Peter Royal, stated that she had committed suicide. Alberta Deputy Premier Thomas Lukaszuk posted a tweet stating that McConnell's death was a \\"Sad end to what already was a tragedy\\".

It was founded in 1999 with the aim of developing and commercializing a device that utilized resonance frequency analysis (RFA) to determine the level of stability of a dental implant.  Patented technology  In a dental implant procedure, a hole is drilled into the jawbone and a titanium implant is inserted. If and when the implant has proven to be stable in the jawbone, a prosthetic tooth is then affixed to the implant. Osstell‚Äôs patented RFA device (the most recent generation called Osstell IDx) helps dentists assess the stability of the implant, without having to physically disturb it. A small aluminum rod, called a SmartPeg, is placed in the implant. The RFA device prompts vibration in the rod by initiating magnetic pulses of varying frequencies. The RFA device detects the resonance frequency of the rod (called SmartPeg) while attached to the implant. The resonance frequency is converted to a numeric scale from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher stability. This scale, called the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ), corresponds with kHz frequency range of 3500‚Äì8500 kHz. The ISQ scale was developed by Osstell in order to give an immediately comprehensible indicator of implant stability and is now the global standard for implant stability measurement.

Description and history The J.R. Darling Store is located in the linear village center of Groton, on the north side of Scott Highway near its junction with Powder Spring Road. Scott Highway (US 302) is a major regional east-west route, connecting to Montpelier in the west and Littleton, New Hampshire in the east, and points beyond. The store is an L-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and mostly granite foundation. The exterior is finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and vinyl siding, and has modest vernacular Victorian decoration. The front facade has a recessed entrance flanked by a square commercial display windows, with an open balustraded porch above. A secondary entrance projects from the side of the main block. A residential ell extends to the right of the main block from its rear, with part covered by a single-story shed-roof porch. with The location where the Darling Store stands has a commercial history, including a tailor's shop established by one of Groton's first white settlers in the early 19th century. Later, a tavern with meeting hall was built in the site; the hall was for many years where town meetings were held. About 1877, Jonathan R. Darling, a prominent local businessman and politician, purchased the property, and relocated the tavern portion to adjacent land (where it now forms part of the Alice Lord Goodine House, the public library). The oldest portion of the present building, its front section, was built about 1895, and it was enlarged several times, achieving its present form in the 1920s. Portions of the building were extensively damaged by a fire in 1980, but were sympathetically rebuilt. The building now houses residences in the rear and a winery shop in the front retail section.

These kingdoms flourished in the 14th century, especially the Mali Empire, who saw a cultural flowering within their empire centred on the University of Timbuktu.  Trans-Saharan Trade  The 12th through the 16th centuries were known as the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of trade, when West African gold was in high demand. This led to an increase in the need and use for trade routes. Before, during, and after the 14th century, the Trans-Saharan trade routes were used for trade, travel, and scholarship. Much of what scholars know of the Trans- Saharan trade routes comes from the historical writings of Muslim scholars such as Ibn Battuta and Leo Africanus who both crossed the Sahara Desert in the 14th and 15th centuries. These literary narratives combined with archaeological data provide much insight into 14th century trade. = Geography = thumb Satellite image of North Africa, showing the Sahara Desert. Throughout the 14th century, much of African trade revolved around the Trans-Saharan trade routes. Geographically, the Sahara Desert extends over 3.6 million square miles and is the second-largest desert on the planet behind Antarctica. While the Sahara Desert was often viewed as a barrier between the African countries, it actually linked them together rather than separated them.  Empires  While trade along the Trans-Sahara trade route was common in the 14th century, it was highly dependent on the powerful African Empires, such as the Mali Empire, Kingdom of Kongo, Benin Kingdom, Hausa City- states, Great Zimbabwe, Ethiopian Empire, Kilwa Sultanate, and the Ajuran Sultanate. = Muslim Influence =  Ibn Battuta  leftthumb193x193px An artist's representation of Ibn Battuta. In 1352‚Äì53, Ibn Battuta embarked on a pilgrimage from Morocco to the Mali empire. Throughout his travels, he described many aspects of the Trans-Saharan trade routes that he encountered on his journey to Mali. He passed through Morocco and the surrounding cities, and much of the Niger Bend. During his travels, Battuta chronicled everything he saw. The trade routes from Sijilmasa to Walata passed through the salt mines of Taghaza. The town of Takeda in the Niger Bend was a centre for copper mining and trade in Egyptian goods, like cloth. The routes from Morocco to Egypt were large distribution centres for gold. thumb Map of Ibn Battuta's route into West Africa In his memoirs, Battuta also described the dangers of the trade routes. It took months for merchants to cross the Sahara Desert, and they faced challenges ranging from natural disasters to lost caravans. Travelers who ventured too far away from their caravans and got lost often died from the elements. If scouts died or strayed away from their groups, the caravans would get lost in the desert and wander. Even worse, natural disasters, such as sand storms or fluctuating temperatures, often forced merchants to abandon their goods to save their own lives, yet causing them to lose everything. In his memoir, Battuta described the Sahara as a ‚Äúdesert haunted by demons.‚Äù Mansa Musa By the end of the 10th century, Islam had spread to many of the Northern and Western African empires. By the 14th century, empires such as Ghana and Mali, had strong ties with the Muslim world, and many of their most prominent leaders practised the Muslim faith. Mali's most famous ruler, Mansa Musa, travelled across the Trans-Saharan trade routes on his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325. Because Islam became so prominent in North and West Africa, many of the trade routes and caravan networks were controlled by Muslim nations. In the 14th century, prominent trade and travel routes had been firmly established. = Trade Goods = During the 14th century, and later the 15th century, the primary trading goods along the Trans-Saharan trade routes were gold, salt, precious metals, such as copper and iron, ivory, spices, materials, such as skins, cloth, and leather, and also slaves.  Trade Routes  thumb A 19th-century engraving depicting an Arab slave-trading caravan Trade among the Sahara Desert was highly influenced by the prominent Western empires and the local people living along the trade routes. In the 10th-15th centuries the major empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay influenced many of the trade practices. These powerful empires would extend their hand of power over African trade by directing trade routes through the major cities and taxing the travelling merchants and their goods. Through the power of the empires, many of the trade routes were secured and the merchant profession became a prosperous one. When travelling, traders could travel individually or in groups, or they could attach themselves to an annual caravan. Along the trade routes, local or residential tribes would establish and maintain resting posts for the traveling merchants. The scouts often used these trading posts to guide the caravans along the correct trade routes.  The Spread of Islam  Since the origin of the religion, Islam has had an evident influence in the culture where its followers would inhabit. Since the religion affects major aspects of its follower's lifestyle, this convert-focused religion would influence family values, social conduct, and even judicial practices of the surrounding communities. As Muslims conquered more land, the practices of Islam would spread wherever they went. Islam primarily spread its influence to the Northern and Eastern coast of Africa. = Northern Africa = After the Nomadic Almohad peoples overthrew the Almoravids of Spain and North Africa, by the 13th century its government had collapsed from within and split into 3 different states, consisting of both Almoravid and Almohad groups. Then in 1415, the Spanish Reconquista forced the most of the Muslims out of Spain and into North Africa. During this transition from the Almohad empire to the Muslim tri-state era, trade between Europe and North Africa increased the wealth of the primarily Muslim region, as well as their ability to maintain power in the Sahara. Their control of the gold trade routes led to the rise of the great Mali empire.  The Mali Empire  The Mali Empire was one of the great empires of West Africa, reaching its peak in the 14th century. Mali was founded by the legendary Sundiata Keita in approximately 1230 after defeating the Sosso at the battle of Krina. Its capital was at Niani, in modern Guinea. After Sundiata's death in 1255, the kingship remained in the Keita family line until 1285. In 1285, after a series of weak kings, a freed slave named Sakura took the throne. Sakura was an effective ruler, but died while returning from his pilgrimage to Mecca. = 14th Century Mali = The Mali Empire's entrance into the 14th century was heralded by a return of the throne to the Keita family line with the reign of Mansa (king) Qu. Mansa Qu's successor was his son, Mansa Muhammad. An artist's depiction of Mansa Musa  Mansa Musa  Map of Mali Empire under Mansa Musa In 1312 the most famous Malian king, Mansa Musa, came to power. Mansa Musa's reign marks the golden age of the Mali empire, spreading its territory and fame far and wide. Under Mansa Musa, the empire reached as far as the Atlantic Ocean in the West and past the trading cities of Timbuktu and Gao in the East, encompassing the past kingdom of Ghana in its entirety, and was home to an estimated five to ten million people. = Pilgrimage to Mecca = Mansa Musa's global renown came as a result of his Hajj in 1324. He set out with a vast entourage across the Sahara desert toward Mecca. In Cairo, he initially refused to visit the sultan, as the tradition at the time was for the visitor to bow before him, and Musa believed himself to be of superior rank and power. Eventually, he made a compromise and bowed before Allah in the presence of the sultan. After the encounter, the sultan honoured Mansa Musa by inviting him to sit beside him as an equal, and they spoke for some time. According to the Islamic writer Al-Umari, Mansa Musa brought with him no less than 100 camels laden with 300 pounds of gold each, as well as 60,000 people wearing silk, 12,000 servants, and 500 gold-staff bearing slaves before him. > \\"Let me add that gold in Egypt had enjoyed a high rate of exchange up to the > moment of their [Mansa Musa's] arrival. The gold medal that year had not > fallen below twenty-five drachmas. But from that day onward, its value > dwindled; the exchange was ruined, and even now it has not recovered. The > mitqal scarcely touches twenty-two drachmas. That is how it has been for > twelve years from that time, because of the great amounts of gold they > brought into Egypt and spent there.\\" ‚Äî Al Umari = Mansa Musa's Legacy = Catalan Atlas of the known world (Mappa Mundi), drawn by Abraham Cresques of Mallorca. Musa is shown holding a gold nugget and wearing a European-style crown. Ancient manuscript from Timbuktu On his return journey back to Mali, Mansa Musa brought with him many scholars, artisans, architects, and other men of learning. They built many magnificent structures, including the mosque of Gao, and buildings in Timbuktu. He also established a diplomatic relationship with the sultan of Morocco, with the two kings mutually sending ambassadors to the other's court. Mansa Musa had a lifelong dedication to education and sent many young men to be educated at the university in Fez, Morocco who eventually returned and began Quranic schools and universities in many Malian cities, namely Timbuktu. The tale of the wealth of the Mansa of Mali spread far around the globe, making the Malian Empire one of the most famous African empires of its time‚Äîeven being featured on ancient European maps. Mansa Musa has been claimed to have been the richest person to have ever lived, with an estimated net worth adjusted for inflation of $400 billion (as of 2012). Mansa Musa's reign ushered in a time of peace and prosperity in Mali that would last through the reign of his eventual successor, Mansa Suleyman.  Mansa Maghan  Mansa Maghan was the son of Mansa Musa, and was not a skilled leader. He ruled as Mansa of Mali beginning in 1337 but was in power for only four years before his uncle and Mansa Musa's brother, Suleyman Keita, became emperor in 1341. There was some question as to whether Suleyman had a hand in Meghan's deposition, and some internal conflict resulted from the change in leadership.  Mansa Suleyman Keita  Mansa Suleyman Keita succeeded Mansa Maghan, and was a proficient ruler, though his reign was not as peaceful as Mansa Musa's, and some land east of Timbuktu and Gao was lost to the Songhai people. Despite the growing unrest in the region, Mali still enjoyed a great level of political stability and security as noted by the famed Islamic explorer and writer Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. > \\"The negroes possess some admirable qualities. They are seldom unjust and > have a greater abhorrence of injustice than any other people. Their sultan > [the Mansa] shows no mercy to anyone guilty o the least act of it. There is > complete security in their country. Neither traveller nor inhabitant has > anything to fear from robbers or men of violence.\\" ‚Äî Ibn Battuta The death of Mansa Suleyman marked the beginning of the period of decline in the Mali Empire. The time leading into the 15th century was characterized by weak rulers, short reigns, and disputes over succession. = 15th Century Mali = Modern Mali207x207px Though the Mali Empire was now in the hands of weak kings, it continued to exist well into the 15th century. Timbuktu was an important point of both trade and learning in Imperial Mali, so its loss to Tuareg Berbers in 1433 was a significant blow to the weakening state. In addition to Tuareg rebellion, the Mossi people revolted and began raiding towns deep within Mali. Eventually, the city of Gao in the East broke off from Mali, as did the Wolof cities along the coast in the West. Throughout the 15th century, Mali progressively shrunk in size as many of its territories abandoned the empire, though it continued existing as an independent entity well into the 16th century. However, in 1546, the Songhai kingdom sacked Mali's capital, Niani, formally ending Mali's rule as an independent empire.  14th and 15th Century Marinid Dynasty  = Origins = Flag of Marinid empire The Marinid dynasty was composed of Berber tribes of the race of the Zenetes (Zenatas), as opposed to the Hilalian Arabs, and were under the rule of the Almohads. But early in the 12th century, they turned against a weakening Almohad to build a dynasty that lasted nearly two centuries. With the defeat of the last of the Almohads and the capture of Marrakech in 1269, the Marƒ´nids, under Ab≈´ Y≈´suf Ya øq≈´b, became masters of Morocco. = Holy War on the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa = Marinid empire at its greatest extent, around 1348. During the 14th century the Marinids expanded their control in Norther Africa and fought Holy Wars with the Christians on the Iberian Peninsula. Marinids viewed jihad as the duty of Muslim sovereignty and to strengthened the dynasty. During the reign of Abu Sa'id Uthman II, the Marinids extended their authority over the Middle Maghrib. They also crossed into al-Andalus in response to a request from the governor of Granada. Abu Sa'id was succeeded by his son, Abu-l-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Uthman, who seized Tilmisan in 1332. In 1333, Abd al-Malik, crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and defeated the Castilians who occupied the region since 1309. When Abd al-Malik died his father, Abu al-Hasan, led another invasion in 1340 onto the Iberian Peninsula but was defeated by a coalition of forces from Castile and Portugal at the Salado River. While the war helped unite the Muslim Na·π£rid dynasty of Granada and slowed the advance of the Christians toward the Strait of Gibraltar, no land was taken from the Christians. This defeat significantly changed the balance of power in favour of Christians forcing the Marinids to retreat to Morocco and to abandon their objective of domination of the Iberian Peninsula. al-Mansoura constructed by the Marinids during their siege of Tlemcen.left In addition to invasions on the Iberian Peninsula, the Marinids wanted to control the central Maghreb and Ifriqiya. Their first attacks were against the Abdalwadids of Tlemcen, the Marinids immediate neighbours to the east, whom they invade several times. In 1337 Ab≈´ al-·∏§asan  øAlƒ´, one of the Marƒ´nid sultans, tried to restore the Almonad empire. He captured the Tunisia capital of TilimsƒÅn (Tlemcen) but was unable to defeat the ·∏§af·π£id. But in 1347, Abu-l-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Uthman also captured Tunis and the Hafsid amir. He later also captured Barqa and Tarablus. During this time the Marinids united all of the Maghrib under one government. This expansion was temporary because the following year, Abu-l-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Uthman's army was defeated in Kairouan by a coalition of Arab tribes. Eventually, the Near Maghrib and the Middle Maghrib seceded from the Marinid state when weak rulers rose to power causing it to return to its original borders. These military campaigns depleted the resources of the Marinid dynasty and led to a state of anarchy. = Decline of the Marinids = Marinid Tombs at the Necropolis of Chellah The defeat in Kairouan diminished the power of the Marinids, who slipped into a period of decline. In the West Maghreb, the Marinids are not able to control the entire population. The Arab tribes grow more restless, the tax receipts decline and the sultans lose their power in favour of the Arab viziers, who are representatives of a real caste of high officials which take control of the kingdom and declare themselves as sultans themselves. The leaders are subjected to a close guardianship during this period of upheaval and the smallest amount of diffidence would lead to the overthrow or the assassination of the sultan. Both Abu Salim (1359-1361), and Abu Ziyan (1361-1366) were assassinated during this period of anarchy. The state of anarchy which existed during the late 14th century a led to a break down of unity in the empire and several contenders opposed the vizier which divided the country. Although the dynasty is in a state of decline during this time it was strong enough in 1389 to defuse the Abdalwadides and control the foreign relations of the sultans of Tlemcen. The final blow to the Marinids came from the Spanish Christians who invaded Berber in 1401 and destroy the city of Tetouan. A few years later in 1415, the Portuguese took over the city of Ceuta. The Marinids, who could not repel these invasions, saw their control over the population greatly diminish. The dynasty was unable to resist the unrest and revolutions of palaces, which are getting worse. In 1420, the Sultan Abu Said was assassinated. His successors survived under the guidance of the Wattasides, the Berber dynasty that reigned after the fall of Marinids. In 1465, with the assassination of Sultan Abd al-Haqq, the Marinids disappeared permanently as a ruling force. The Wattasides dynasty collapsed in 1548 when the Sa ødƒ´ sharifs took F√®s. = 14th and 15th Century Marinid Sultans of Fez and Morocco = * Abu Yaqub Yusuf (1286‚Äì1306) * Abu Thabit Amir (1307‚Äì1308) * Abu al-Rabi Sulayman (1308‚Äì1310) * Abu Said Uthman II (1310‚Äì1331) * Abu al-Hasan 'Ali (1331‚Äì1348) * Abu Inan Faris (1348‚Äì1358) * Muhammad II as Said (1359) * Abu Salim Ali II (1359‚Äì1361) * Abu Umar Tashfin (1361) * Abu Zayyan Muhammad III (1362‚Äì1366) * Abu l-Fariz Abdul Aziz I (1366‚Äì1372) * Muhammad as-Sa√Æd (1372‚Äì1374) * Abu l-Abbas Ahmad (1374‚Äì1384) * Abu Zayyan Muhammad IV (1384‚Äì1386) * Muhammad V (1386‚Äì1387) * Abu l-Abbas Ahmad (1387‚Äì1393) * Abdul Aziz II (1393‚Äì1398) * Abdullah (1398‚Äì1399) * Abu Said Uthman III (1399‚Äì1420) * Abd al-Haqq II (1420‚Äì1465)  14th and 15th Century Solomonic Dynasty  Mountains in the Ethiopian highlands. The Christian Solomonic Dynasty ruled in the highlands of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. To the east and south were the Muslim kingdoms of Ifat and Adal. By the 14th century Solomonic Kings had been ruling for thirty years, having taken over from the previous Zagwe Dynasty in 1270. The Solomonic Kings claimed their heritage to the union of the Biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and to the Axumite kings. The primary literature documenting this newly restored line is the Kebra Nagast. This heritage linked the crown and the church, which both saw growth during this period. The Solomonic Empire was an outpost of Christianity, neighbored by Muslim nations which it frequently fought with. Solomonic kings of this era did not maintain a capital, but rather moved the court from place to place. The primary ruling of day-to-day life was determined by local leaders. = 14th and 15th Century Emperors of the Solomonic Dynasty = * Wed Arad (1299-1314) * Amda Seyon I (1314-1344) * Neway Kristos (1344-1372) * Neway Maryam (1372-1382) * Dawit I (1382-1413) * Tewodros I (1413-1414) * Yeshaq I (1414-1429) * Andreas (1429-1430) * Takla Maryam (1430-1433) * Saree Iyasus (1433-1433) * Amda Iyasus (1433-1434) * Zara Yacob (1434-1468) * Baeda Maryam I (1468-1478) * Eskender (1478-1494) * Amda Sayon II (1494-1494) * Na'od (1494-1508)  Amda Seyon  Amda Seyon was emperor from 1314 to 1344, and his reign began with a tension between church and crown after he seduced his father's concubine and two sisters. This action causes a monk, Honorius, to openly rebuke him. In retaliation to the rebuke, Amda punished and banished many of the local monks. Throughout his reign Amda conducted many wars against Ethiopia's Muslim neighbours, primarily the kingdoms of Ifat and Adal. His conquests put pressure on Egypt to send a new abun, which for many years had been denied to the Ethiopian Church. His conquests also brought in many new territories, which rebelled on many different occasions.An Ethiopian cross typical of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  Zara Yacob  Zara Yacob, who reigned from 1434 to 1468, was a reformer of the Church, an organizer of the government, and a warrior. Before his ascension to the throne, he was educated at an Eritrean monastery. During his reign, he did much to propagate the Church throughout his territories, including bringing in two co-buns and placing laws about the religious matter, with strict consequences. His coronation was held in Axum, reminiscent of the Axumite kings and his heritage. Zara Yacob intended to unite his kingdom with Christianity, as the main line of defence against its Muslim and pagan neighbours. During his reign he sent a delegation to Europe to reunite the Ethiopian Church with its Roman counterpart, as well as to develop diplomatic connections. During his reign a number of religious text were written and translated, including the Berhan. Zara Yacob also reorganized the government, reallocating land and fixing the tribute. During this time there was continued warring with the Muslim kingdoms. = Christianity in Solomonid Ethiopia = Solomonid rule was based on a biblical heritage and as such the kings and the country maintained Christianity as the state religion. The branch of Christianity that was followed during the 14th and 15th century was primarily Coptic Christianity, with the abuna's, or bishops, coming from Egypt. In the 14th century there was a break-off from the traditional Coptic Church in the form of Sabbatarians, who believed that they had purified their Christianity. These people would later be known as the Beta Israel, following a distinct pre-Talmudic faith.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Lamoille County Courthouse is centrally located in the village of Hyde Park, amid a cluster of other government buildings set back from the south side of Main Street. It is an imposing -story brick building, with -story pyramid-roofed tower rising from the front left corner. The main roof is hipped, with dormers projecting from each side, and a low pyramidal roof at the front right corner. The tower has a square belfry stage below the roof, which is pierced by dormered clock faces and topped by a weathervane. The front facade is five bays wide, with a single-story porch extending across the center three bays. It is supported by round columns, and has Union Jack balustrade both on the ground floor, and encircling its roof. Second-floor windows are set in round- arch openings, with the outer and central bays housing doubled windows. with The county's first courthouse was built in Hyde Park in 1836, not long after the county was created by the state legislature, and Hyde Park was chosen as its shire town. That courthouse and 17 other buildings were destroyed by Hyde Park's \\"Great Fire\\" in 1910; county records were preserved in fireproof safes. The present building was built in 1911‚Äì12 to a design by Burlington architect Zachary Taylor Austin. It is stylistically a distinctive blend of the Colonial Revival and Romanesque Revival, a combination not seen in the state's other county courthouses. The interior, which includes a large courtroom spanning the second floor, has seen little alteration since its construction. It is believed that this building's fire vaults may be those from the 1836 courthouse.

It was first opened in 1673, when Taiwan still formed the Kingdom of Tungning ruled by the Ming-loyalist Zheng dynasty. Koxinga's son Zheng Jing attempted to abandon the Ming cause and seek peaceful recognition as an independent leader from the Kangxi Emperor but was rebuffed and forced into a defensive war with the mainland.. The Chi Jin temple was built to house an idol of Mazu brought by the Fujianese fishermen who first settled the island under Hsu Au-hua. The Hung, Wang, Cai, Li, Bai, and Pan families were chiefly responsible for the temples' governance and property, which formed the core of early Kaohsiung. Mazu was credited with the success of the Qing conquest of Taiwan in 1683 and the temple changed its name to reflect her new title of \\"Heavenly Empress\\" around 1737.

Morgan joined North Melbourne as a delisted free agent on a one-year contract; if certain conditions are met, the deal will be extended by a year. He wears his previous number 21 after Jy Simpkin switched to 12.

Following extensive trialling in a number of major competitions, VAR was first written into the Laws of the Game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in 2018. Operating under the philosophy of \\"minimal interference, maximum benefit\\", the VAR system seeks to provide a way for \\"clear and obvious errors\\" and \\"serious missed incidents\\" to be corrected. Procedure There are four categories of decisions that can be reviewed: * Goal/no goal ‚Äì attacking team commits an offence, ball out of play, ball entering goal, offside, handball, offences and encroachment during penalty kicks. * Penalty/no penalty ‚Äì attacking team commits an offence, ball out of play, location of offence, incorrect awarding, offence not penalised. * Straight red card ‚Äì denial of obvious goal-scoring opportunity, serious foul play, violent conduct/biting/spitting, using offensive/insulting/abusive language or gestures. All straight red cards are subject to review. * Mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card. =Check= A VAR decision during an FA Cup match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester. The VAR team, stationed in the video operation room (VOR), automatically checks every on-field referee decision falling under the four reviewable categories. If the VAR does not identify any mistake during the check, this is communicated to the referee. This is called a \\"silent check\\" and requires no further action, usually not causing any delay to the game. At other times, a VAR check may cause the game to be delayed while the VAR ascertains whether or not a possible mistake has occurred. The referee may delay the restart of play for this to occur, and indicates an ongoing check by pointing to their ear. Where the VAR does identify a possible clear and obvious error, there are three possible scenarios: * Decision overturned on advice of VAR * On-field review (OFR) recommended * Referee chooses to ignore VAR advice A decision can generally be overturned without an OFR where it relates to a factual matter. For example, offside decisions or whether a foul occurred inside or outside the penalty area can be determined by the VAR to the referee without a review. An OFR is generally recommended where there is a subjective decision to make, such as whether a foul was committed in the first place or whether a red card is warranted for a certain offence. In all cases, the final decision rests with the referee, and they can choose to ignore the advice of the VAR altogether. =On-field review (OFR)= A Major League Soccer referee reviewing a play using a sideline monitorAn OFR can only be conducted on the recommendation of the VAR. This ensures that the referee always makes an on-field ruling and does not rely on OFRs for every close decision. An OFR can be conducted when the ball is out of play, or where the referee stops play for the express purpose of conducting one. The referee signals an OFR by making the outline of a rectangle, indicating a video screen. The OFR takes place in a designated referee review area (RRA), adjacent to the field of play and in public view to ensure transparency. Slow motion replays are only used to establish point of contact for physical offences and handball, while full-speed replays are shown to determine the intensity of an offence or whether a handball occurred in the first place. During an OFR, the VAR transmits several video replays from different camera angles to allow the referee to make their decision. Once an OFR is completed, the referee makes the TV signal again, before indicating the decision made. If the ball was out of play, it restarts with either the original decision or the new decision if the on-field one was changed. If play was stopped to conduct an OFR and the decision was not changed, a dropped ball occurs. =Offences= A number of offences relating to the VAR process are codified within the Laws of the Game. Both players and team officials excessively making the TV signal are cautioned. Any player or team official entering the RRA are also cautioned. Finally, entering the VOR will cause a player or team official to be sent off. =Assistant video assistant referee= Assistant video assistant referees in action during a Saudi Professional League match The assistant video assistant referee (AVAR) is a current or former referee appointed to assist the VAR in the video operation room. The responsibilities of the AVAR include watching the live action on the field while the VAR is undertaking a \\"check\\" or a \\"review\\", to keep a record of reviewable incidents, and to communicate the outcome of a review to broadcasters. Glossary A number of technical terms and abbreviations are used in reference to the VAR system. These include: * Check ‚Äì Process by which the VAR automatically inspects all reviewable decisions. A check can result in confirmation of the on-field decision (a \\"silent check\\"), a change in decision for factual matters (e.g. offside/not offside) or the recommendation of an OFR. * Clear and obvious error ‚Äì Degree required for an on-field decision to be overturned. * OFR ‚Äì On- field review; review process that occurs following recommendation by the VAR. Used where a clear and obvious mistake may have been made in regards to a subjective decision. * RO ‚Äì Replay operator; non-referee official who assists video officials by managing the broadcast and finding the best angles to allow for the right decision to be made * RRA ‚Äì Referee review area; area where an OFR is conducted, located adjacent to the field of play and in sight at all times * VAR ‚Äì Video Assistant Referee; main video official whose main role is to check all reviewable incidents and recommend an OFR where a possible clear and obvious error has occurred. The VAR is a current or former qualified referee. * Video official ‚Äì Category of match official, alongside on-field officials. Consists of VAR and any AVARs. * VOR ‚Äì Video operation room; room where the VAR team is located. The VOR can be located in or near the stadium, or in a centralised location such as a broadcast centre. History VAR was conceived by the Refereeing 2.0 project in the early 2010s, under the direction of the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB). The system was tested through mock trials during the 2012‚Äì13 season of the Eredivisie, the country's top football league. In 2014, the KNVB petitioned the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to amend its laws of the games to allow the system to be used during more extensive trials. The IFAB approved trials and a pathway to full implementation during its 2016 general meeting. Lukas Brud, IFAB secretary, said \\"With all the 4G and Wi-Fi in stadia today...we knew we had to protect referees from making mistakes that everyone can see immediately\\", such as Thierry Henry‚Äôs handball that eliminated Ireland from qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup where the on-field referees were not in a position to view the infraction. Then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who was strongly against introducing new technology in football, was forced out of his post due to a corruption scandal in 2015, and the VAR proposal received a warm reception under his successor Gianni Infantino. The first live trial of the VAR system was in July 2016 in a friendly match between PSV and FC Eindhoven The next live trial of the VAR system began in August 2016 with a United Soccer League match between two Major League Soccer reserve sides. Match referee Ismail Elfath reviewed two fouls during the match and, after consultation with video assistant referee Allen Chapman, decided to issue a red card and a yellow card in the respective incidents. Video reviews were introduced the following month during an international friendly between France and Italy. The first professional \\"non-friendly\\" game was an official first round KNVB beker national Cup tie between Ajax and Willem II on 22 September 2016. . This match was the first match to include a \\"pitchside monitor\\". The pitchside monitor would allow the referee to review footage from the field. Based on VAR but not using the available pitchside monitor, a yellow card was turned into a red card and thus this was the first ever VAR based expulsion in a professional game. Interestingly, this professional and official Cup game was played before the official FIFA rule change. The major learning from this decision is that VAR decision needed to be clearly communicated to the player, the watching public inside the stadium and on TV. The next event that VAR was used, including a \\"pitchside monitor\\" was at the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. Kashima Antlers was awarded a penalty after a video review in the 3-0 win of semi-final against Atl√©tico Nacional. Others also falsely claimed to be first with VAR Major League Soccer in the United States introduced VARs in competitive matches during its 2017 season after the 2017 MLS All-Star Game on 2 August 2017. Its first official use came during a match between the Philadelphia Union and FC Dallas, invalidating a goal from the latter over contact made between a Dallas player and Philadelphia's goalkeeper. VAR was used at an international level in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in June, where it was praised but its usefulness was questioned after a referee decision in the final match. After the 2016 introduction in CUP football in Europe, the VAR system was introduced in top flight European football league competitions by Bundesliga and the Serie A at the beginning of the 2017‚Äì18 season and by La Liga at the beginning of the 2018‚Äì19 season. The system was also used at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in October. On 8 January 2018, VAR was trialled for the first time in England in the 2017‚Äì18 FA Cup game between Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace, and the following day it was trialled for the first time in France in the C√¥te d'Azur derby game in the 2017‚Äì18 French League Cup. It was said to have worked well. Italy opened the world's first VAR training centre in Coverciano in January 2018. On 3 March 2018, the IFAB wrote the VARs into the Laws of the Game on a permanent basis. Their use remains optional for competitions, and the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League were not expected to implement VAR for their 2018‚Äì19 season. However Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore has described it as \\"inevitable\\" that VAR will be introduced to the Premier League. On 27 September 2018, UEFA announced that from the 2019‚Äì20 UEFA Champions League season, VARs will be used in the competition. Although VAR was not implemented in the group stages of the 2018‚Äì19 season, UEFA announced on 3 December 2018, that VAR would be used in the knockout stages, which commenced in February 2019. On 15 November 2018, Premier League teams voted in principle to bring Video Assistant Referees to the Premier League from the 2019‚Äì20 season onwards pending approval of IFAB and FIFA; this comes after a controversial decision from referee Simon Hooper to disallow a goal scored by Southampton F.C. striker Charlie Austin. On 1 January 2020, the Emperor's Cup Final was the first Japanese football match to use VAR, and, at the same time, to prepare the introduction of VAR into Olympic football. =2018 FIFA World Cup= FIFA officially approved the use of VAR for the 2018 FIFA World Cup during the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogot√°. This tournament became the first competition to use VAR in full (at all matches and in all venues). Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) being shown a yellow card after a challenge with Iranian player that was reviewed by referee Enrique C√°ceres as a potential red card incident The 2018 World Cup marked the system's World Cup debut. A total of 335 incidents were checked by the VAR over the course of the group stage, averaging seven per match, and fourteen calls made by referees were changed or overruled after being reviewed by the VAR. According to FIFA, the VAR system had a success rate of 99.3 percent, up from the 95 percent of correct calls by referees without VAR. The first VAR decision at the World Cup came on 16 June 2018 in a group stage match between France and Australia, where referee Andres Cunha awarded a penalty to France after consulting with the VAR. In the final, referee N√©stor Pitana used the VAR to review a defensive foul for handling in the penalty area, awarding France a penalty, which gave them a 2‚Äì1 lead over Croatia. The final eventually ended with France prevailing 4‚Äì2. The use of VAR has been credited with assisting the 2018 edition's status as the cleanest World Cup since 1986, after no red cards were issued in the opening 11 games and only four players were sent off in the entire tournament which was the fewest since 1978. 22 goals were scored from 29 awarded penalty kicks, beating the previous record of 17 penalty kick goals set in the 1998 tournament; the dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished. IFAB technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray stated a belief that the presence of VAR meant that players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system. Criticism The use of video technology at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup was criticised after several contentious moments involving VAR at the tournament. It was accused of \\"creating as much confusion as clarity\\". Further criticism was leveled at VAR after it suffered issues preventing its use, for example in a Portuguese match where a supporter's flag had been obscuring the VAR camera, or in the 2018 A-League Grand Final between Newcastle Jets and Melbourne Victory where the VAR software suffered a technical malfunction which prevented the assistant referee from viewing the replay. After the introduction of VAR in the 2018 World Cup, FIFA deemed it a success. Nevertheless, the use (or lack of use) of VAR has been criticised. Independent assessments note that while most decisions were made correctly as a result of VAR, some were wrong despite VAR review and some decisions which were called incorrectly were not even reviewed. The Guardian concludes that VAR has been most effective for factual decisions such as offsides and mistaken identities, while subjective decisions such as penalties or the disciplining of players have fared much worse. Lack of clarity and consistency are two main areas of weakness. Another line of criticism has been targeted at the effectiveness of the system in achieving its goal. In the opinion of Scott Stinson from the National Post, VAR, like any other replay system, fails to correct human error and instead only adds to the controversies because human judgment is still necessary. Lack of transparency is another contentious point, as teams have no way to know which incidents were reviewed by the VAR team. At a press conference held after the group stage, FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina showed footage of the decision-making process accompanied with audio of the conversations between VAR officials and the referees. Asked if this audio could be made publicly available, as it is in rugby and cricket, Collina answered enthusiastically but cautioned that it might still be too early. Others have pointed to the game-changing nature of VAR. Initial fears that using the system would lengthen the game considerably have not been confirmed, with every VAR review taking up an average of only 80 seconds. The dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished. Of the 169 goals scored in the tournament, 22 were from penalty kicks (with 29 being awarded in total), beating the previous record of 17 set in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Jonathan Liew of The Independent compares the situation to the introduction of the Decision Review System in cricket and notes the changes it had on that sport, and suggests that it might lead to changes of a similar nature in football. In February 2019, UEFA issued guidance which stated that players who made a 'TV-screen' hand gesture should result in a yellow card. \\"Excessively using the 'review' (TV screen) signal\\" is now listed as a caution for which a player may receive a yellow card in the Laws of the Game. Early uses of VAR in the Premier League, at the beginning of the 2019‚Äì20 season, were described as confusing to both coaches and fans with the decision making often inconsistent. Competitions using VAR VAR in use in the UEFA Champions League group stage in 2019 Competitions which include VAR confirmed matches are \\"live\\" matches, i.e. where the VARs have contact with the referee on the field of play and therefore may have an impact on the decision making.

It is not to be confused with Neostoicism, an analogous phenomenon in the 17th century. The term \\"Modern Stoicism\\" covers both the revival of interest in the Stoic philosophy and the philosophical efforts to adjust Ancient Stoicism to the language and conceptual framework of the present. The rise of Modern Stoicism has received attention in the international media since around November 2012 when the first Annual Stoic Week event was organized.  Background  =Philosophy= Modern Stoicism arose as part of the late 20th century surge of interest in virtue ethics. \\"The [...] work by philosophers like Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Martha Nussbaum, among others, have brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant Kantian‚Äìdeontological and utilitarian‚Äìconsequentialist approaches.\\" Modern Stoicism draws from the late 20th and early 21st century spike in publications of scholarly works on Ancient Stoicism. Beyond that, the Modern Stoicism movement traces its roots to the work of Dr. Albert Ellis, who developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, as well as Aaron T. Beck, who is regarded by many as the father to early versions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Viktor Frankl also found Stoicism useful while he was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II; he later developed his theory known as logotherapy. In Lawrence Becker's words, \\"it is interesting to try to imagine what might have happened if Stoicism had a continuous twenty-three-hundred-year history; if Stoics had had to confront Bacon and Descartes, Newton and Locke, Hobbes and Bentham, Hume and Kant, Darwin and Marx.\\" Or, as Massimo Pigliucci puts it more concisely, \\"it is worth considering what it means to 'be a Stoic' in the 21st century.\\" The first major modern work that spelled out the key premises of Modern Stoicism was, arguably, A New Stoicism by Lawrence Becker, first published in 1997. For other important books, see the notable books section below. =Psychology and psychotherapy= Stoic philosophy was the original philosophical inspiration for modern cognitive psychotherapy, particularly as mediated by Dr. Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), the major precursor of CBT. The original cognitive therapy treatment manual for depression by Aaron T. Beck et al. states, \\"The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers\\".Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery (1979) Cognitive Therapy of Depression, p. 8. A well-known quotation from Enchiridion of Epictetus was taught to most clients during the initial session of traditional REBT by Ellis and his followers: \\"It's not the events that upset us, but our judgments about the events.\\" This subsequently became a common element in the socialization phase of many other approaches to CBT. The question of Stoicism's influence on modern psychotherapy, particularly REBT and CBT, was described in detail in The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy by Donald Robertson. Moreover, several early 20th century psychotherapists were influenced by Stoicism, most notably the \\"rational persuasion\\" school founded by the Swiss neurologist and psychotherapist Paul DuBois, who drew heavily on Stoicism in his clinical work and encouraged his clients to study passages from Seneca the Younger as homework assignments. = As a popular movement = The Modern Stoicism movement relies heavily on global social media and online communities. As E.O. Scott puts it \\"Modern Stoicism is really a 'Web 2.0' phenomenon.\\" One of the key sites is the Modern Stoicism website, which harbors the Stoicism Today blog and hosts the Annual Stoic Week (online) and Stoicon (offline) events. Another important place is the New Stoa, which was founded in May 1996 and is arguably the first lasting Stoic community on the internet. Three key podcasts talking about Stoicism applied to modern thought are the Stoic Solutions Podcast hosted by Justin Vacula, The Practical Stoic Podcast hosted by Simon Drew and Steve Karafit's The Sunday Stoic Several personal blogs exploring Stoicism, some of them run by notable Stoic scholars (e.g. Massimo Pigliucci, William Irvine, John Sellars) and some by therapists who explore Stoic applications (e.g. Donald Robertson). Articles on Stoicism have appeared on popular websites. In E.O.Scott's words, \\"[the] potent combination of social media and a few highly publicized books and articles [...] has recently launched Stoicism on an exponential growth curve.\\" There is a variety of Stoic meetups and groups based in places such as Australia, Denver, Dublin, Edinburgh, Fremont, Helsinki, Lisbon, London, Manchester, Milwaukee, New York, Orlando, San Francisco, Toronto and Warsaw, amongst others. According to E.O. Scott, \\"arguably the most important and influential gathering place for Modern Stoics [online]\\" is the \\"stoicism group\\" on Facebook of ~40 000 people (as of January 2019). The analogous Reddit group has amassed ~118 500 users (as of December 13, 2018). Beyond the Anglophone there is the \\"Sztuka ≈ºycia wed≈Çug stoik√≥w\\" site run by Piotr Stankiewicz, \\"Stoicyzm Uliczny\\" run by Marcin Fabja≈Ñski and Centrum Praktyki Stoickiej run by Tomasz Mazur and others. Applications of Modern Stoicism are reported across industries. According to \\"Forbes,\\" Modern Stoic thought \\"hold[s] fascinating promise for business and government leaders tackling global problems in a turbulent, post-recession slump.\\" However, two Stoic academics, Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos, have warned against using \\"life-hack Stoicism\\" or \\"Silicon Valley Stoicism\\", as the primary means of understanding Stoic philosophy. Subsequently, they discussed on a popular Stoic blog, Stoicism's role in advocating for change in society, including when it comes to standing against gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Similarities of Modern Stoicism and Third Wave CBT have been suggested as well, and its potency in treating depression has been studied. There has also been interest in applying the tenets of Ancient Stoicism to the human origin story, environmental education, vegetarianism and the modern challenges of sustainable development, material consumption and consumerism.  Differences between Modern and Ancient Stoicism  = Problems with the appeal to nature = The Ancient Stoics held as unquestionable dogma that in order to live a good life one needed to live consistently with nature. According to the Ancient Stoics, nature was by definition good and everything which was conformable to nature was deemed good. Moreover, the Ancient Stoics had a teleological outlook on the world, that is, they held that everything in the universe was purposefully and rationally organized to a good end. However, this view is much more difficult to uphold in the present day. As Becker puts it, \\"science presented significant challenges to our [Stoic] metaphysical views.\\" The notion of the rational organization of the world seems much more doubtful in the 21st century than it, presumably, was two millennia ago. \\"When we face the universe,\\" Becker writes, \\"we confront its indifference to us and our own insignificance to it. It takes no apparent notice of us, has no role other than Extra for us to play, no aim for us to follow.\\" Even more pressing questions are raised when we face our own human realm, with the long and still expanding record of genocide and atrocity and the manslaughter that followed. These are major challenges for the ancient Stoic view of the world as a rational and essentially good being. An analogous problem appears with human nature (as contrasted to the nature of the universe as a whole) in which the idea of \\"following our human nature\\" also raises serious questions. As Becker describes it, \\"it is 'natural' to find these [defining] traits in human character and conduct, but it is equally natural to find a significant number of exceptions. As a result, none of these characteristics fits into the most familiar forms of ethical argument from human nature, e.g. (a) that humans are by nature X, and that Y is contrary to X, hence, that Y is contrary to human nature; or (b) that X is what defines the unique function (the essence) of a human being, thus to flourish as a human being is to excel at X.\\" In this vein, \\"following human nature\\" yields no specific guidelines for conduct either. All told, this is one of the central problems for Modern Stoicism: that in the 21st century it is far more difficult to ground our ethical framework in \\"nature\\", be it universal, cosmic nature, or to special human nature. Becker acknowledges this problem and asserts that \\"Stoic ethics would be much better off without its 'follow nature' slogan.\\" Yet, he reflects that the Stoics are, \\"however, too deeply branded with it to renounce it now. The best we can do is reinterpret it.\\" The reinterpretation he proposes is this. \\"Following nature means following the facts. It means getting the facts about the physical and social world we inhabit, and the facts about our situation in it [...] before we deliberate about normative matters. It means facing those facts ‚Äì accepting them for exactly what they are, no more and no less ‚Äì before we draw normative conclusions from them. It means doing ethics from the facts constructing normative propositions a posteriori. It means adjusting those normative propositions to fit changes in the facts, and accepting those adjustments for exactly what they are, no more and no less. And it means living within the facts ‚Äì within the realm of actual rather than hypothetical norm.\\" This process of \\"getting the facts about the [...] world\\" happens in some measure (but not exclusively) through science. In Becker's words, \\"The biological, behavioral, and social sciences contribute to ethics in three important ways: they offer a wealth of material that can be used in the naturalistic arguments [...], they offer explanatory theories (e.g. from evolutionary biology) that help separate relatively fixed traits from transient or malleable ones and they offer powerful, elaborate analyses of learning, rationality, and rational choice.\\" Ethical reasoning of a Stoic \\"cannot begin until all relevant description, representation, and prediction are in hand, [...] ‚Äì until, let us say, the empirical work is done.\\" This empirical work may be obtained by the scientific method and thus the principle of \\"following facts\\" can be (in some contexts) read as \\"not contradicting science\\" (not to be confused with simple \\"following science\\", which would be reductive and misleading). However, this issue that is raised with the ancient stoic and modern stoic ways of thought on physics can only be attributed to Becker and not all Modern Stoics find this to be an issue. As the field of physics is being constantly redefined by different laws and understandings, some stoics believe that Becker was not trying to redefine nature as the ancient stoics saw it but as the neostoics defined when they attempted to combine Christianity and Stoicism in the 16th century. Ancient Stoics simply believed that there was an active and passive material of nature and that one controlled reason and one was acted upon with reason. = Virtue, agency, happiness = Becker organizes his reading of Stoic ethics around the concept of agency. \\"The Development of Virtue [happens through] the Perfection of Agency,\\" or through the \\"ideal agency\\" as he calls it. This can be described as the belief in the \\"inherent primacy of virtue in terms of maximization of one's agency\\". This agency is understood in terms of \\"a balance of control and stability\\" and is executed all-things-considered, i.e. upon having obtained the most detailed information about the facts as available. Happiness, in this view, is also explained and achieved through agency. \\"We hold,\\" this is Becker again, \\"that happiness as understood by mature and fit agents is a property of whole lives, not of transient mental states. We hold that it is achievable only through a proper balance of stability and control in the exercise of agency.\\" And, \\"this sort of happiness with one's life also appears to be a psychological consequence of healthy agency [...] The life of a Stoic sage is filled with such happiness, as a consequence of virtue.\\" = Degrees of virtue = In Becker's version of Stoicism, several dogmas of Ancients Stoicism are questioned or challenged. For example, the traditional Stoic all-or-nothing understanding of virtue is questioned (to some extent). In Orthodox Ancient Stoicism one was either a perfect sage or no sage at all, there was no middle ground, or in between. The Ancient Stoic virtue admits of no degrees. Becker lays ground for a softer, more nuanced approach. \\"You can drown,\\" he writes, \\"face down on the calm surface of the sea as surely as at the bottom. [...] We [i.e. the Modern Stoics] follow later colleagues in thinking that these doctrines are untenable.\\" = Aspirations for universality = Another dogma of the Ancient Stoics that is sometimes questioned in Modern Stoicism is the idea that the gateways of Stoic philosophy are open to everyone and that living a Stoic life is definitely the best option for every human being. Becker suggests that \\"acting appropriately, as understood here, is a special kind of optimization project ‚Äì one that it is logically possible to reject. (Which people with compulsive, obsessive, or addictive personalities may in fact reject.) [Modern Stoicism's] claim is, only healthy agents, at least those well along the road to fitness in their deliberative powers, cannot plausibly reject it.\\" = Stoicism versus Aristotelianism = In the Orthodox Ancient Stoic view there are absolutely no entry conditions to living a Stoic life. One can become a sage no matter the circumstances: be it poverty, illness, physical adversity and so on. This issue has traditionally been a major point of differentiation between the Stoics and the Peripatetics, who held that a certain amount of external goods is necessary for development of virtue. Becker appears to side with the Aristotelians on this matter, saying \\"it is [...] plausible to conclude, however, that there is an identifiable kernel of bodily and psychological health that is a necessary condition of all further development. If this kernel is damaged, so is the capacity to develop agency.\\" = Dichotomy of control = An important concept of Ancient Stoicism is the distinction between things within one's power and not within our power. While this concept is embraced fully by many Modern Stoics, some reinterpret it. Becker, for instance, points out that the whole idea of the dichotomy is in fact a major oversimplification. As he puts it, \\"[the] distinction between things that are within our control, or 'up to us', and those who are not [...] [is] misleading.\\" Instead, he proposes to read it along the lines of \\"it is wise to calibrate the strength, depth, and dissemination of our attachments to the fragility and transience of the objects involved.\\" William Irvine goes even further and undermines the central premise of the dichotomy, i.e. that the distinction between things \\"in our power\\" and \\"not in our power\\" is sharp and that there is no third option. Irvine suggests the possibility of turning the \\"dichotomy of control\\" into a \\"trichotomy of control\\". Irvine argues that \\"[w]e can restate Epictetus's dichotomy as follows: There are things over which we have complete control and things over which we have no control at all\\" as well as suggesting that \\"the dichotomy is a false dichotomy, since it ignores the existence of things over which we have some but not complete control.\\" Pigliucci describes it as follows: \\"some things are up to us (chiefly, our judgments and actions), some things are not up to us (major historical events, natural phenomena), but on a number of other things we have partial control. Irvine recasts the third category in terms of internalized goals, which makes more sense of the original dichotomy.\\" = Asceticism and renunciation = Modern Stoicism has no unified position regarding the ascetic elements in Stoicism and in defining the sage's attitude towards the ordinary pleasures of life. Becker mentions \\"the confusion, both among Stoics and their critics\\" and the \\"false notion that the Stoic ideal is a life devoid of the ordinary pleasures of sex, food, drink, music, wealth, fame, friends, and so on\\". According to Becker this confusion happens because \\"Stoics have occasionally claimed that, for the sage, eudaimonia somehow replaces ordinary happiness.\\" In this vein, Stankiewicz argued against the \\"ascetic misinterpretation\\", saying that \\"Stoicism is not asceticism and a Stoic is not a monk. In fact, it is the school of The Pale Epicureans that is closer to the ideal of abstemiousness. The Stoic proposal is far broader and it extends far beyond the narrow passage of the ascetic way.\\" Thus, \\"we [the Modern Stoics] must face the lushness, diversity and ‚Äì yes! ‚Äì sensuality of life and we have to live and thrive inside this world, accepting it as it is. Unlike a monk, a Stoic doesn't dodge the myriad of different aspects of the earthly and sensual life.\\" On the other hand, Kevin Patrick refutes this argument, ridiculing it as \\"hedonic Stoicism\\" and saying that the mentioned position \\"falls into the more common trap and misinterpretation, that since externals are indifferent to us, we should go ahead and indulge in all of those things for which we have a proclivity\\". \\"Modern Stoics,\\" he concludes, \\"ought to be Stoics.\\" Irvine takes a more modest stance and he proposes a program of \\"voluntary discomfort\\". As he describes it: \\"By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort ‚Äì by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed ‚Äì we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.\\"  Notable books  The following list, arranged by date of first publication, includes positions representing modern Stoicism only, while it excludes purely scholarship books on ancient Stoics, biographies, etc. * James Stockdale, Courage Under Fire (Stanford University: Hoover Essays, 1993) * Sharon Lebell, The Art of Living.
